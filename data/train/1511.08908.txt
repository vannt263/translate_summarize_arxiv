    "we consider the classical hamiltonian in @xmath7 given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real positive parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 are conjugate coordinates and momenta , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath16 can be interpreted as the lagrangian generating the geodesic motion of a particle of mass @xmath17 on a conformally flat space known as the darboux space of type iii ( d - iii ) . as remarked in @xcite ,",
    "such an @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath0d ) curved space is the spherically symmetric generalization of the d - iii surface  @xcite , which was constructed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the central potential @xmath18 was proven to be an ` intrinsic oscillator ' potential on that space @xcite .",
    "we recall that this definition was first proposed in @xcite and that a generalization of the bertrand s theorem @xcite to 3d conformally flat riemannian spaces has been developed in  @xcite . in this respect , we shall say that the hamiltonian ( [ hclassica ] ) determines the d - iii oscillator .",
    "we also notice that in  @xcite the hamiltonian @xmath19 has been proven to be maximally superintegrable by taking advantage of its super - separability ( like the usual harmonic oscillator , the system turns out to be separable both in cartesian and ( hyper)spherical coordinates ) .",
    "this property has been further analysed in a number of subsequent papers ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and references therein ) , where its algebraic content was explained in terms of the _ demkov  fradkin tensor _",
    "@xcite given by @xmath20 we recall here that the hamiltonian @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of hyperspherical coordinates @xmath22 , @xmath23 and canonical momenta @xmath24 , @xmath25 , ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) defined by    @xmath29    such that @xmath30 where the radial coordinate @xmath22 is canonically conjugated to the radial momentum @xmath24 .",
    "then , for a fixed value of @xmath31 , the hamiltonian can be written as a one - degree of freedom radial system .    as a matter of fact",
    "the system associated with @xmath19 can be considered as a genuine ( maximally superintegrable ) @xmath10-deformation of the usual @xmath0d isotropic harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath9 , since the limit @xmath32 yields @xmath33    we remind also that both the classical and the quantum problems have been investigated ( see  @xcite ) in the special case characterized by positive values of the deformation parameter @xmath10 .",
    "also , an in - depth discussion of the @xmath34 case for the classical system can be found in @xcite where , however , the explicit formula of the trajectory has not been derived .    in the present work",
    "our scope is rather different from the one pursued in @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "we deal just with the classical system and restrict our considerations to the 3d case , with emphasis on the algebraic side of the problem . in this context",
    "we show that the so - called _ spectrum generating algebra _ ( sga ) technique @xcite provides us with all the necessary ingredients to achieve its solution , _ at least in the @xmath35 case _ , in full analogy with the classical taub - nut system  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will derive the solution for both bounded and unbounded motions . on the other hand , through a direct approach , we will be able to handle the @xmath34 case as well , getting an explicit formula for @xmath36 holding in the _ punctured open ball _ @xmath37and thus making some progress with respect to what had been already derived in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    * in section @xmath38 we perform the factorization of the classical hamiltonian and derive the appropriate poisson algebra for the ordinary isotropic harmonic oscillator , recovering the well - known solution to the equation of motion . * in section @xmath39 , paraphrasing the procedure followed in @xcite we solve the equations of motion in the @xmath40 case .",
    "as it happened for the taub - nut system , the solution is obtained in the form @xmath41 . as already noticed in @xcite , in contrast with the usual harmonic oscillator , for sufficiently high energy values",
    "there are unbounded orbits ( the particle can escape to infinity ) which in the quantum setting corresponds to the onset of a continuous spectrum . coherently with the predictions of the bertrand s theorem ,",
    "the bounded orbits will be closed and there will be stable circular trajectories . * in section @xmath42 the @xmath43 case will be tersely investigated",
    ". we will get behaviours that are similar to those exhibited by the taub - nut system for negative values of the deformation parameter @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "indeed , in a sort of dual way with respect to the taub - nut case , the kinetic energy ( and thus the metric ) remains positive in the bounded region @xmath45 while it takes negative values for @xmath46 .",
    "so , in order to get an admissible metric for @xmath46 , we should there resort to time - reversal symmetry to restore positivity . on the other hand , in that unbounded region",
    "the effective potential is a monotonic function of @xmath22 having a constant limiting value at infinity , implying that no closed orbits can arise . *",
    "the main results and some further perspectives are outlined in the concluding section .",
    "before using the machinery of the sga approach to tackle the @xmath47 case , we will firstly characterize the euclidean case in order to check our future results in the ( flat ) limit @xmath32 and to illustrate the usual sga procedure .",
    "therefore , let us consider the hamiltonian @xmath48 where @xmath22 is the radial coordinate and @xmath49 is the radial momentum related to the particle of mass @xmath17 , frequency @xmath9 and angular momentum @xmath50 .",
    "the effective potential is so given by    @xmath51    clearly , in order to have closed orbits , the values of the energy have to be confined in the region @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the minimum of the effective potential , i.e. its value calculated at @xmath54 ( see lhs of figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "now , in order to apply the sga technique , we proceed by factorizing the hamiltonian as follows @xmath55 where @xmath56 are unknown functions to be determined . in particular , taking into account , we obtain @xmath57 and then @xmath58 the hamiltonian @xmath59 and @xmath56 are functions of the canonical coordinates @xmath60 and they have to close the following poisson algebra @xcite : @xmath61 in particular , using the expressions , we obtain that @xmath62 summarizing , we have the following relations @xmath63 at this point we can define the _ time - dependent constants of motion _",
    "@xmath64 such that @xmath65 as we know , those dynamical variables can be written as @xmath66 and allow us to determine the motion @xcite .",
    "indeed it holds : @xmath67 by imposing ( [ factoriz ] ) along ( [ za ] ) , that is , @xmath68 we find that @xmath69 where @xmath70     ( [ effpot ] ) and phase plane @xmath71 calculated for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( in appropriate units).,title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=207 ]   ( [ effpot ] ) and phase plane @xmath71 calculated for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( in appropriate units).,title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=207 ]    now , since the hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time , it is a constant of motion , i.e. the energy of the system @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , summing and subtracting we obtain ( on the level surface @xmath74 ) @xmath75 finally , using we are able to write @xmath22 and @xmath76 as functions of @xmath77 : @xmath78 & p(t)=- \\dfrac{q_0 \\sin \\left(2   \\ , \\omega   t + \\theta_0\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac { e}{m \\omega^2}+\\dfrac{q_0}{m \\omega } \\cos \\left(2 \\ , \\omega   t + \\theta_0\\right ) } } \\ , .",

    "in the following , we shall deal with the deformed case using the same procedure .",
    "clearly , the results just obtained in this section have to be recovered in the euclidean ( i.e. @xmath32 ) limit .",
    "in this section we focus our attention on the d - iii oscillator hamiltonian ( [ hclassica ] ) written as a 1d radial system by means of hyperspherical coordinates , namely @xmath83 where @xmath17 , @xmath9 and @xmath50 are positive constants , @xmath10 is the deformation parameter , @xmath59 is the ` undeformed ' isotropic oscillator hamiltonian and @xmath84 multiplying both sides of by @xmath85 we get : @xmath86 now , as it has been done in the previous section for the undeformed case , at any @xmath22 we can factorize as : @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 are unknown functions of @xmath22 , @xmath76 .",
    "we make the following _ ansatz _ for @xmath88 , @xmath89 : @xmath90 the ` arbitrary function ' @xmath91 will be determined by requiring the closure of the poisson algebra generated by @xmath92 and @xmath93 : @xmath94 where the functions @xmath95 , @xmath96 have to be determined . inserting @xmath93 in we get @xmath97 and requiring that @xmath93 obey the proper poisson brackets we arrive at @xmath98",
    "hence we find that @xmath99 @xmath100 we notice that in the limit @xmath32 one gets back the undeformed poisson algebra as expected .",
    "we also point out that the requirement @xmath101 implies the upper bound @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , for bounded motion , the energy has to be greater than the minimum of the effective potential @xmath103 .",
    "the latter turns out to be @xmath104 as a consequence the energy belongs to the interval ( see lhs of figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig3a ] ) @xmath105    next , as usual , in order to find the corresponding trajectory we define the _ time - dependent constants of the motion _",

    "furthermore , the case of @xmath10 negative has also been analyzed .",
    "for the latter situation , as we have already seen in the classical taub - nut system @xcite , the most interesting features of the dynamics are somehow hidden ` beyond the singularity ' , in the open set @xmath139 , where for suitable initial conditions the particle remains trapped during its whole life . as a matter of fact , in that region the effective potential shows a typical confining shape and the kinetic energy is always positive definite . we were then enabled to recover an explicit formula for the trajectory , restricted to that domain , simply by taking @xmath36 for @xmath151 .    in the quantum case",
    "we expect similar features , however _ in that punctured open ball _ we might miss the algebraic nature of the spectrum and , accordingly , an analytic expression for the wave functions might not be available .",
