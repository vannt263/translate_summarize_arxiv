    "in many different physical and mathematical problems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) it is of interest to know the spectral density of sub - unitary ensemble of random matrices of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is @xmath1 unitary matrix distributed according to the standard haar measure and @xmath4 is a diagonal matrix of the form @xmath5 where each @xmath6 obeys @xmath7 .    the exact formula for the spectral density of these matrices for finite @xmath0 and arbitrary @xmath6 has been obtained in @xcite by a supersymmetry method . in the conclusion of that paper",
    "the authors wrote : `` an interesting problem would be to investigate the density of complex eigenvalues in the limit @xmath8 assuming that @xmath9 has a finite density @xmath10 of eigenvalues @xmath6 in an interval of the @xmath9-axis '' .",
    "first of all we would like to stress that such type of asymptotic questions is very natural within the free probability theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact , an explicit solution to this problem has been found in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this note is to demonstrate how this answer can be derived from the exact formulas obtained in @xcite .",
    "for general @xmath6 the matrix ( [ main ] ) have complex eigenvalues @xmath11 .",
    "the question we address is to calculate the mean density of these eigenvalues in the limit of large matrix dimensions @xmath12 here @xmath13 denoted the average over the haar measure of matrices @xmath3 .",
    "assume that limiting positive moments of @xmath6 in ( [ g_i ] ) @xmath14 are finite which is equivalent to the existence of finite limiting measure for @xmath6 .    according to the theorem 4.4 of @xcite the limiting measure @xmath15 ( [ nu_t ] ) of ensemble of matrices ( [ main ] )",
    "is non - zero in the annulus @xmath16 if @xmath17 diverges the lower bound is set to zero .    inside this annulus",
    "the mean number of eigenvalues of matrix ( [ main ] ) in complex plane in polar coordinates @xmath18 is @xmath19 and the integrated spectral density is determined from the equation @xmath20 the function @xmath21 here is calculated as follows .",
    "define first the generation function of integer moments @xmath22 by the formula @xmath23 then one has to invert this function , i.e. to find the function @xmath24 such that @xmath25 the knowledge of this function permits to calculate the so - called @xmath26-transform of @xmath9 which is typical in free probability theory @xcite @xmath27 finally the function @xmath21 which enters to the mean density of eigenvalues ( [ final_1 ] ) takes the form @xmath28 in other words , the integrated mean density of eigenvalues , @xmath29 , is the inverse function to @xmath21 i.e. @xmath30 . from the above equations one easily gets that @xmath31 has to be determined from the equation @xmath32 for clarity let us consider the simplest example of truncated random unitary matrix ensemble investigated in @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the case when @xmath33 for @xmath34 with all others @xmath35 and @xmath36 when @xmath8 . in this case @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath39 in ( [ psi ] ) is now @xmath40 from which it follows that the solution of ( [ simple ] ) is @xmath41 which corresponds to the radial spectral density equal to @xmath42 this result agrees with eq .  ( 19 ) of @xcite up to the normalisation . in that paper",
    "the authors normalized the density to the number of non - zero eigenvalues , but in the above formulas the density is normalized to the total number of eigenvalues which gives an additional factor of @xmath43 .",
    "assume that @xmath6 are ordered : @xmath44 .",

    "it follows that the saddle point obeys the same equation as ( [ simple ] ) which justify the notation @xmath73 for the saddle point .",

    "the difference between the integrals over @xmath70 and over @xmath69 is that in the former the integration is performed along the real axis but in the later the integration contour should be deformed to pass through the saddle point parallel to the imaginary axis .",
