    "a key consideration is the fact that a sbhb formed by capture in the gas disk has a high likelihood of forming with retrograde orbital angular momentum .",
    "this can be seen by considering a secondary sbh on a faster interior disk orbit entering the hill sphere of a primary sbh on a slower outer disk orbit .",

    "the resulting binary will merger faster than a binary with prograde orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "when a binary with retrograde orbital angular momentum merges , it will produce a larger mass sbh with retrograde spin @xmath289 compared to prograde disk gas ( assuming accretion is negligible during binary merger ) .",
    "the same is true for binaries formed by capture at a migration trap .",
    "sbhb merger rates could actually be dominated by retrograde binary mergers because retrograde binaries harden faster ( see @xcite and  [ sec : isolated ] ) .",
    "once a retrograde spin ( anti - aligned ) sbh ( @xmath290 ) has been produced , there are two ways to produce a low spin sbh consistent with the ligo precursors : a subsequent merger with a prograde spin ( aligned ) sbh @xmath291 or significant ( super - eddington ) accretion onto the black hole @xcite . in the first scenario ,",

    "a third way of producing low effective spin is multiple unequal mass mergers @xcite .    for a fiducial agn lifetime of @xmath94myr ,",

    "interestingly , the likely formation of anti - aligned binaries in the agn disk allow ligo a unique chance to test the spin precession instability @xcite .",
    "once a sbhb merges , the resulting merger product can experience a gravitational radiation recoil kick ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the mass of gas in the disk is much larger than the mass of individual binaries , the orbital angular momentum of the binary and the spins of the merger precursors will tend to align or anti - align with the plane of the disk over time . from @xcite , a gas accretion rate of @xmath302 of the bh mass",
    "is enough to align the spin of a bh with a surrounding massive gas disk .",

    "the merged product will have a typical kick of @xmath304 depending on relative spins and mass ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "assuming that the sbhb tend to live in the equatorial plane of the agn disk , these kicks correspond to minor perturbations of the keplerian orbits of the merged sbhb in the plane of the disk .",
    "mergers of sbh with spins aligned with the plane of the disk produce the largest magnitude kicks ( up to several thousand @xmath305 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the probability that a kick will be large depends on both spin alignments and the angle between the spins and the binary orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the spins of sbh in an agn disk will tend to be poorly aligned in the early stages of the disk .",
    "occasional merger kicks may therefore be quite large , allowing escape from the nucleus in some cases .",
    "however , in general the kicks will be small and a population of overweight sbh will build up in the agn disk .",
    "as the merger products persist in the agn disk and as other sbh are ground - down into the disk we expect a population of @xmath306 sbh to build up in the disk , with spin aligning or anti - aligning with orbital angular momentum . the result of kicks between aligned / anti - aligned objects is to incline the merger product s orbit relative to the agn disk by a small angle @xmath307 .",
    "once @xmath308 , which should be true for most mergers , the resulting orbital inclination angle is @xmath309 and in principle the merger product could be ground back down into the disk in less than the fiducial disk lifetime ( see  [ sec : grind ] above ) .",
    "the disk generally functions as a reservoir of dynamic cooling ( a dynamic refrigerator ) for sbh and sbhb in the disk , by damping and circularizing orbits .",
    "the main source of dynamical heating for orbits in the disk comes from the surrounding spherical population in the nucleus .",
    "however semi - analytic calculations in @xcite suggest the spherical population is inefficient at dynamically heating the disk population .",

    "binary formation within the disk and 3 .",

    "there are two basic dynamical populations of stars and stellar components in our model ; namely a disk component and a spherical component .",
    "the disk dynamical component consists of those objects in the nuclear cluster embedded in the gas disk and those formed in - situ in the disk .",

    "<S> our rate estimate is dominated by the accelerated , gas - driven merger in the agn disk of pre - existing sbh from a nuclear star cluster whose orbits are ground down into the agn disk . </S>",
