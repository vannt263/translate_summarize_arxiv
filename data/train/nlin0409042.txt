    "optical vortices are two- or three - dimensional ( 2d or 3d ) dark or bright solitons with an embedded phase dislocation , which lends them a topological charge ( `` spin '' ) . as topologically nontrivial self - trapped states ,",
    "the vortices have attracted a great deal of attention , which was additionally enhanced by a potential which the 2d ones may have as reconfigurable conduits for weak optical signals @xcite .",
    "vortex solitons of the bright type are of special interest in both respects .",
    "first , being relatively compact objects , they make it possible to realize sophisticated multi - vortex configurations . on the other hand , experimental creation of bright solitons",
    "is hampered by the fact that , in media with the simplest collapse - free nonlinearities ( quadratic or saturable ) , they are subject to strong azimuthal instability , which splits them into a set of ordinary ( zero - spin ) solitons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as it was first observed in direct simulations of a model with the cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later investigated in detail by more accurate methods ( see a review in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , bright vortices with the spin @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite , and @xmath6 @xcite may be stable if the model features competing self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinearities .",
    "another example which corroborates this conclusion is a model combining quadratic and self - defocusing cubic nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "later , stable two - component ( _ vectorial _ ) solitons , carrying the vorticity set @xmath7 , have been identified in a vectorial version of the cq model @xcite .",
    "it is relevant to mention that patterns of a similar type , in the form of `` soliton necklaces '' , i.e. , ring - shaped chains of the fundamental ( @xmath8 ) solitons , were introduced and studied in the model with the kerr ( cubic ) nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the necklaces may be constructed with zero or non - integer angular momentum ; however , they are not stationary objects , as they spread out and eventually disintegrate .",
    "a possibility to ( practically ) stabilize necklace - like patterns is to introduce a vectorial interaction with a fundamental soliton , which helps to support vortex - mode , dipole - mode , and multipole vector solitons @xcite .",
    "additional stabilization of two - component necklaces in vectorial model allows to construct stationary necklace - ring vector solitons @xcite , having azimuthally modulated ( necklace - type ) components whose densities sum up into an azimuthally uniform distribution of the total intensity",
    ". however , multipole and necklace - ring vector solitons are subject to an azimuthal instability , except of the dipole - mode vector soliton @xcite and vortex - mode soliton close to a bifurcation @xcite .",
    "a particular class of such ( generally , unstable ) solutions is a vector vortex soliton with equal amplitude distributions in both components @xcite .",
    "a challenging issue is a possibility of the existence of stable vectorial solitons of the @xmath1 type , that would feature the same annular shape ( with a hole in the center ) as the bright scalar or vectorial vortices with the spins , respectively , @xmath9 or @xmath7 , but with zero net spin .",
    "the possibility of the existence of such objects is obvious if the coupling between the components is of the xpm ( cross - phase - modulation ) type , i.e. , insensitive to their relative phase  then , there is no difference in the shape between stationary vortex solitons of the @xmath7 and @xmath1 types .",
    "however , in the simplest collapse - free model with saturable nonlinearity , which is based on xpm - coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations for local slowly varying amplitudes @xmath10 , with terms like @xmath11 , the @xmath1 vortices are unstable [ as well as their @xmath7 counterparts ] , although it was demonstrated that the instability may be partly suppressed @xcite .",
    "a stabilizing effect of the incoherent interaction of counter - rotating vortices was also demonstrated in an anisotropic photorefractive self - defocusing medium @xcite .",
    "compound vortices with the spin components @xmath12 and @xmath13 were also studied in the three - wave model of the type - ii second - harmonic generation , with two components of the fundamental wave , and one second - harmonic component @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in this model per se , vortices of both types are unstable  against fusion into an ordinary zero - spin soliton , or splitting , respectively .",
    "the addition of a stabilizing repulsive cubic interaction makes the life expectancy of the vortices much longer , but no case of complete stabilization has been found @xcite .    in this work , we demonstrate that , in contrast with all the previously studied models , in the two - component cq model the @xmath1 vortex solitons are _ rigorously stable _ in a certain parameter region .",
    "in fact , this result opens up a new class of stable 2d solitons with _",
    "hidden vorticity _ ( hv ) .",
    "we start with a general two - component cq model in the rescaled form , which describes spatial evolution ( along the propagation coordinate @xmath14 ) of the light beams in a bulk medium @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the local slowly varying amplitudes of the two waves , and the laplacian @xmath17 is the diffraction operator acting on the transverse coordinates @xmath18 . the real parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the cubic and quintic xpm coefficients , respectively .",
    "the cq nonlinearity was experimentally observed in isotropic media , such as glasses @xcite and organic materials @xcite ; these materials also feature nonlinear loss , but the consideration of the conservative model is justified , as the characteristic soliton s length can be made essentially smaller than the absorption length , or the loss may be compensated by gain . in that case ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 may be realized as orthogonally polarized waves , with @xmath23 for linear and @xmath24 for circular polarizations , respectively .",
    "the latter case pertains as well to a set of two waves with different carrier wavelengths . besides that",
    ", the model ( [ e12 ] ) may serve as a crude isotropic approximation for the description of photorefractive media in the low - saturation regime , which is characterized by equal strengths of the xpm and spm ( self - phase - modulation ) nonlinearities , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "thus , different values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are physically relevant .",
    "it is well known that fundamental ( @xmath8 ) solitons , both scalar and vectorial [ the latter ones , of the type @xmath28 , are stable in models with any saturable nonlinearity , including the cq model ( for the isotropic scalar saturable model , this was demonstrated more than a decade ago @xcite ) .",
    "recently , stability of a vectorial soliton which is fundamental ( @xmath8 ) in one component , and carries the vorticity @xmath2 in the other , i.e. , a  vortex - mode soliton \" of the @xmath29 type , has been predicted close to a bifurcation in the saturable medium @xcite .",
    "more complex vectorial solitons , combining a zero - vorticity configuration in one component and a topologically charged one in the other , are also possible in saturable media @xcite .",
    "such solutions definitely exist in the cq model too , and they are plausibly stable in a broad parametric area .",
    "in this work we focus on the vectorial vortex solitons of the @xmath0 types with symmetric components , which carry equal wave numbers @xmath30 ( non - symmetric solutions with @xmath31 are possible too , but we do not expect their properties to be drastically different from those of the symmetric solitons ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the polar coordinates in the plane @xmath18 , and the real function @xmath35 obeys the equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 . using the transformation @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , we cast eq .",
