    "there is an increasing evidence of conspicuous mass concentrations in the center of galaxies , lending support to the idea that their central engine is constituted by a black hole ( see @xcite , @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "this evidence comes both from stellar and gaseous dynamics . in this latter case",
    "the mass concentration is deduced by the observation of an increase towards the center of the rotation velocity of the gaseous disk , according to the kepler s third law .",
    "seven circumnuclear keplerian disks ( hereafter cnkd ) have been up to now observed : four have been discovered in elliptical galaxies using the high resolution capability of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ ( @xcite ) , while three were detected in spirals with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) and very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of maser sources ( @xcite ) .    in a program aimed to study with high spatial and spectral resolution the structure of the emission lines in the nuclear regions of early - type disk galaxies",
    ", we have obtained with the 3.6-m telescope at la silla major axis spectra of the sa galaxies ngc  2179 and ngc  5064 . in the first case it is possible to recognize ,",
    "applying our modeling technique , the kinematical behavior typical of a cnkd while the second represents a limiting case for its detection with our instrumental setup .",
    "in addition we apply our modeling to three early - type disk galaxies ( ngc  4343 , ngc  4435 and ngc  4459 ) observed by rubin , kenney & young ( 1997 ) , showing that also in these cases the shape of the emission lines is consistent with the presence of cnkds . in this way",
    "we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting cnkds with optical ground - based telescopes .",
    "the general data on the galaxies studied are given in table  1 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of ngc  2179 and ngc  5064 were carried out at the 3.6-m eso telescope in la silla on february 3 - 4 , 1997 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with the cassegrain echelle spectrograph mounting the long camera in long - slit configuration without the crossdisperser .",
    "the 31.6 lines mm@xmath3 grating was used in combination with a 13@xmath424 slit .",
    "the spectral order # 86 ( @xmath5  ) corresponding to the redshifted  region was isolated by means of the narrow - band 6630/51   filter .",
    "it yielded a wavelength coverage of about 78   between 6593   and 6670   with a reciprocal dispersion of 3.17 @xmath6 .",
    "the adopted detector was the no .",
    "37 1024@xmath41024 tk1024ab ccd with a 24@xmath424 @xmath7m@xmath8 pixel size .",
    "no on - chip binning was applied and each pixel corresponds to @xmath9@xmath4033 .",
    "we took for ngc  2179 and ngc  5064 six and four separate major - axis spectra ( p.a .",
    "= 170  and p.a .",
    "= 38  respectively ) centered on the nucleus for a total exposure time of 360 and 240 minutes respectively .",
    "the galaxies were centered on the slit using the guiding camera at the beginning of each exposure .",
    "comparison thorium - argon lamp exposures were obtained before and after each object integration .",
    "the value of the seeing fwhm during the observing nights was between 08 and 12 as measured by the la silla differential image motion monitor .",
    "using standard midas routines the spectra were bias subtracted , flat - field corrected , cleaned for cosmic rays and wavelength calibrated .",
    "cosmic rays were identified by comparing the counts in each pixel with the local mean and standard deviation , and then corrected by substituting a suitable value .",
    "the instrumental resolution was derived by measuring the fwhm of @xmath10 single emission lines distributed all over the spectral range of a calibrated comparison spectrum .",
    "it corresponds to a fwhm = @xmath11 (i.e . @xmath12  at ) .",
    "the single spectra of the same object were aligned and coadded using their stellar - continuum centers as reference . in each spectrum",
    "the center of the galaxy was defined by the center of a gaussian fit to the radial profile of the stellar continuum .",
    "the contribution of the sky was determined from the edges of the resulting frame and then subtracted . to study the  emission line",
    ", we subtracted the underlying stellar continuum which was determined by averaging a 2.5   wide region with high s / n adjacent to the line .",
    "a constant stellar continuum provides a good match to the underlying distribution within this narrow wavelength range . for the purpose of this paper",
    "the subtraction of a continuum with the proper  absorption is not crucial since the same bidimensional shape is observed also in the  @xmath136583 line .",
    "we did not model this line bacause it falls at the edge of the sensitivity curve .",
    "in addition to the spectroscopic material narrow - band  imaging of ngc  2179 was performed on march 9 - 11 , 1997 at the 1.8-m vatican advanced technology telescope .",
    "a back illuminated 2048@xmath42048 loral ccd with @xmath14 @xmath7m@xmath8 pixels was used as detector at the aplanatic gregorian focus , f/9 .",
    "it yielded a field of view of @xmath15 with an image scale of @xmath16 pixel@xmath3 after a @xmath17 on - line pixel binning .",
    "we obtained @xmath18 minutes emission - band images and @xmath19 minutes cousins @xmath20band images .",
    "the emission - band images were taken with an interference filter ( @xmath21  ; @xmath22  ) isolating the spectral region characterized by the redshifted  and @xmath236548 , 6583 emission lines .",
    "the data reduction was routine .",
    "gaussian fit to field stars in the two final processed images yielded point spread function fwhm of @xmath24 .",
    "the continuum - free image of ngc  2179 showing the galaxy @xmath25  emission was obtained by subtracting the @xmath26-band image , suitably scaled , from the emission - band image .",
    "the complex bidimensional structure ( in the velocity - position map ) of the  emission line in ngc  2179 is shown in fig .",
    "1a . in the central region ( @xmath27 ) the line",
    "is highly tilted and extends up to @xmath28 .",
    "the intensity distribution along the line shows two symmetric peaks and a central minimum at @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the shape of the emission is such that at @xmath31 we observe @xmath32 .",
    "proceeding further away from the center , @xmath33 increases up to an almost constant value of @xmath34 .    in the following",
    "we demonstrate that the peculiar shape and intensity distribution of these emission lines is not produced by two kinematically distinct components as the appearance could suggest , but they are due to a unique velocity field traced by a thin gaseous disk rotating in the combined potential of a central point - like mass ( @xmath35 as @xmath36 ) embedded in an extended stellar disk and to the deterioration caused by the instrumental resolution and seeing .",
    "the presence of a gaseous disk in the principal plane of ngc  2179 is supported by our  image , which shows a smooth central structure characterized by the same ellipticity ( @xmath37 ) and major - axis position angle ( p.a . @xmath38",
    "170 ) as those of the stellar content observed in the @xmath20band .",
    "the bright knots present in the observed spectrum are due to spiral arms which are also visible in our  image .",
    "we assume that the gas resides in an infinitesimally thin disk whose mean motion is characterized by circular orbits in the plane of the galaxy . at each position",
    "@xmath39 on the sky the line - of - sight velocity profile is a gaussian @xmath40 with mean @xmath41 and dispersion @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the radius in the disk and @xmath44 ( table  1 ) the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "the dispersion is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the gas and @xmath47 is the instrumental dispersion ( assuming a gaussian instrumental broadening function ) .",
    "the gas dispersion is assumed to be isotropic and has been parametrized through @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the scale length of the turbulence .",
    "the circular velocity @xmath50 is produced by the combined potential of a point - like mass @xmath51 and of the disk - like stellar component .",
    "the contribution to the velocity due to the point - like mass is given by @xmath52 .",
    "the contribution @xmath53 due to the stars potential has been directly measured on the emission lines of each spectrum at distances where both the seeing effect and the point - like mass attraction are negligible , and it has been linearly interpolated for smaller @xmath26 by imposing that @xmath54 .",
    "the linearity of this interpolation is not crucial for the model since in the inner regions the potential is dominated by the contribution of the central point - like mass concentration .",
    "the resulting intrinsic velocity profile of the disk is then computed as @xmath55 .    the bidimensional model of the emission lines is given by @xmath56 i(s',b ' ) p(s'-s , b'-b)\\ ] ] where @xmath57 are the coordinate along the slit and perpendicularly to it respectively , while @xmath58 is the slit width and @xmath59 is the pixel size of the detector .",
    "@xmath60 is the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of the disk and has been parametrized as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are free parameters .",
    "@xmath65 is the psf which has been modeled as a gaussian , owing to the lack of a specific psf image obtained at the time of the observations .",
    "note that the parameterizations for @xmath66 and @xmath46 have been chosen because they are able to adequately reproduce our data , but they have no further physical significance .",
    "the line profile @xmath67 , rebinned on a grid with steps @xmath33 ( reciprocal dispersion ) and @xmath59 , can be directly compared to the star - light - subtracted bidimensional spectrum obtained on the ccd . using the above model and the distance given in table  1 we have obtained for ngc  2179 the simulation of the  emission line shown in fig .  1c , which is remarkable for its similarity with the observed one ( fig .",
    "the bright knots in the spectrum due to the spiral arms have not been reproduced in our model .",
    "the point - like mass of the best - fit model is @xmath68 m@xmath1 .",
    "it should be clear that our model shows only the consistency of the observations with the presence of a central point - like mass ( black hole ) .",
    "however a central stellar density cusp could also fit the data . in order to estimate the errors in the central mass determination",
    "we have modeled the shape of the line for different central point - like masses . in fig .",
    "1b and fig .",
    "1d we show two extreme cases where the central mass is smaller and larger respectively by a factor 5 than the mass of the best fit . on the basis of visual comparison with the observations of a series of models we estimate that our error could not be larger than a factor 3 ( @xmath69 in solar units ) .    the bidimensional shape of the  emission line in the second galaxy we observed , ngc  5064 , is shown in fig .",
    "contrary to ngc  2179 , it does not present any peculiar central structure .",
    "the line gives rise to a standard rotation curve with the inner rigid - body rotation extended up to @xmath70 , and followed by a flat portion ( @xmath71 ) . by applying the same modeling technique",
    "as we did for ngc  2179 we computed the shape of the emission lines as a function of decreasing central mass until the complex structure described above tend to disappear .",
    "the limiting case corresponds to a central point - like mass of @xmath72 m@xmath1 and is illustrated in fig  2b . comparing this model with the observed  line in ngc  5064",
    "we deduce that in this galaxy either the central mass is lower than @xmath72 m@xmath1 or the unresolved keplerian part of the gaseous disk does not give a detectable contribution .",
    "emission lines with a bidimensional shape and an intensity distribution similar to those observed in ngc  2179 have been observed also by rubin et al .",
    "we have selected in their sample the most representative ones , namely ngc  4343 ( sa ) , ngc  4435 ( s0 ) and ngc  4459 ( s0 ) .",
    "we applied our modeling techniques to reproduce their isophotal maps , taking into account their instrumental setup and seeing condition .",
    "the comparison between the observations and our models is shown in fig .",
    "3 , and it appears quite satisfactory . in all the three cases the central tilted part of the emission is characterized by the absence of a central intensity peak , both in the model and in the observed line .",
    "the absence of the flat region of the rotation curve produced by the potential of the stellar disk in the case of ngc  4435 can be easily modeled by adopting @xmath73 .",
    "the values of the central masses are of the same order as that of ngc  2179 and are given in table  1 .",
    "a comparison between a set of model lines obtained with different central masses and the observations has been carried out for these galaxies , in the same way as we did for ngc  2179 .",
    "we estimate that the masses given in table  1 for the rubin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) galaxies are affected by uncertainties of the same order of magnitude as in ngc  2179 .",
    "in the previous paragraphs we have shown that the peculiar bidimensional shape of the emission lines in a sample of four galaxies is consistent with the effect produced by the combined potential of a central point - like mass and of an extended component . in this way we were able to point out the presence of central mass concentrations of the order of @xmath74 m@xmath1 in a sample of disk galaxies , observed with ground - based telescopes .    with the observations presented in this paper we demonstrate the possibility of detecting central mass concentrations in galaxies with ground - based telescopes properly equipped using the cnkds as probes .",
    "the masses which can be detected in this way are larger than @xmath72 m@xmath1 at the distance of the virgo cluster . up to now",
    "the higher resolution offered by hst has not contributed to the detection , using cnkds , of central masses lower than this limit .",
    "in fact the four galaxies so far studied with hst posses central masses of the same order of ours . a simulation similar to the one used in this paper predicts that hst , equipped with the space telescope imaging spectrograph will allow to detect central masses down to the level of @xmath75 m@xmath1 .",
    "note that although vlbi spectroscopy of h@xmath76o masers delivers much higher angular resolution , this technique is limited by the availability of suitably bright sources .",
    "we are inclined to think that the detection of lower mass black holes will constitute one of the most proper use of hst , which also allows to put more stringent constraint on the size of the region containing the central mass .",
    "for the four galaxies of this paper with positive detection we can summarize our measurements with a single median value of the ratio of the central mass to the luminosity of the bulge component @xmath77 .",
    "this value is one order of magnitude larger than the median value derived by ho ( 1998 ) from a sample of 20 objects but still within the scatter .",
    "if we assume for @xmath51 of ngc  5064 the upper limit we derived , also this galaxy falls within the scatter of the relation @xmath78 ( ho 1998 ) .",
