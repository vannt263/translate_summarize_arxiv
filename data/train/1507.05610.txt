    "the enhanced mass accretion by tidal instability causes long - lasting superoutbursts [ thermal tidal instability ( tti ) model : @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "although there had been intensive discussions whether superoutbursts are a result of tidal instability or an enhanced mass - transfer from the secondary [ e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , recent detailed analyses of high - precision kepler observations have favored the tti model as the only viable model for ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the material and methods of analysis are given in section [ sec : obs ] , observations and analysis of individual objects are given in section [ sec : individual ] , including some discussions particular to the objects , the general discussion is given in section [ sec : discuss ] and the summary is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the data were obtained under campaigns led by the vsnet collaboration @xcite . for some objects",
    ", we used the public data from the aavso international databasehttp://www.aavso.org / data - download@xmath2 . ] .",
    "the majority of the data were acquired by time - resolved ccd photometry by using 30cm - class telescopes located world - wide , whose observational details will be presented in future papers dealing with analysis and discussion on individual objects of interest .",
    "the list of outbursts and observers is summarized in table [ tab : outobs ] .",
    "the data analysis was performed just in the same way described in @xcite and @xcite and we mainly used r softwarehttp://cran.r - project.org/@xmath2 . ] for data analysis . in de - trending the data , we used both lower ( 15th order ) polynomial fitting and locally - weighted polynomial regression ( lowess : @xcite ) .",
    "the times of superhumps maxima were determined by the template fitting method as described in @xcite .",
    "the times of all observations are expressed in barycentric julian days ( bjd ) .",
    "the abbreviations used in this paper are the same as in @xcite : @xmath3 means the orbital period and @xmath4 for the fractional superhump excess . following @xcite , the alternative fractional superhump excess in the frequency unit @xmath5 has been introduced because this fractional superhump excess can be directly compared to the precession rate .",
    "we therefore used @xmath6 in referring the precession rate .",
    "we used phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ; @xcite ) for period analysis and 1@xmath7 errors for the pdm analysis was estimated by the methods of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "comparisons of @xmath0 diagrams between different superoutbursts are also presented whenever available , since this comparison was one of the main motivations in of these series papers ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . combined @xmath0 diagrams also help identifying superhump stages particularly when observations are insufficient . in drawing combined @xmath0 diagrams",
    ", we usually used @xmath12 for the start of the superoutburst , which usually refers to the first positive detection of the outburst .",
    "this epoch usually has an accuracy of @xmath11 d for well - observed objects , and if the outburst was not sufficiently observed , we mentioned in the figure caption how to estimate @xmath13 in such an outburst .",
    "we also present @xmath0 diagrams and light curves especially for wz sge - type dwarf novae , which are not expected to undergo outbursts in the near future .",
    "in all figures , the binned magnitudes and @xmath0 values are accompanied by 1@xmath7 error bars , which are omitted when the error is smaller than the plot mark .",
    "we used the same terminology of superhumps summarized in @xcite .",
    "we especially call attention to the term `` late superhumps '' .",
    "although this term has been used to refer to various phenomena , we only used the concept of `` traditional '' late superhumps when an @xmath10.5 phase shift is detected [ @xcite ; see also table 1 in @xcite for various types of superhumps ] , since we suspect that many of the past claims of detections of `` late superhumps '' were likely stage c superhumps [ cf .",

    "we used the period of early superhumps as approximate orbital period @xcite .",

    "we used sdss , the initial gaia source list ( igsl , @xcite ) and guide star catalog 2.3.2 .",
    "the coordinates used in this paper are j2000.0 .",
    "questions have been raised to our surveys how to select the periods among the aliases and what is the uncertainty .",
    "such question are natural if one only sees pdm diagrams .",
    "we should note that pdm ( and most of other period finding algorithms ) assumes `` uncorrelated '' ( in time ) observations and defines the statistics .",
    "the actual data have more information , such as the superhump timing data .",
    "even if the pdm result shows strong aliases , we can resolve the alias problem if we have sufficiently long continuous observations ( continuous data produce no aliases ) .",
    "our period selection is mostly based on this principle , when alias selection is inconclusive by the pdm analysis only .",
    "the second approach is to examine the trends of @xmath0 values against the trial periods .",
    "a period longer than the actual one produces systematically decreasing @xmath0 values within each night , and our measurements of the superhump maxima have typical errors of 0.001  d , which is usually sufficient to select one - day aliases when multiple superhumps were detected each night . if the case is not , we describe the uncertainty of the selection .",
    "we show an example how our method works by using the data of fi cet ( subsection [ obj : ficet ] ) . a pdm analysis over a wider range of periods ( figure [ fig : ficetshpdm2 ] ) gives an impression that there are many period candidates and a period of 0.057  d and 0.060  d are equally acceptable .",
    "if we rely on statistics assuming temporarily `` uncorrelated '' observations , this would give equal significance to these periods .",
    "an example for fi cet is shown in figure [ fig : ficetoccomp ] .",
    "scatter in the @xmath0 values and systematic trends within each night are apparent for trial period 0.06033  d , which is rejected .",
    "although we do not show similar figures for other objects due to the limitation of space , we made similar analysis for objects when ambiguities in period selection remained .",
    "readers may be interested in the result of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) analysis , which has been proven to be very effective in detecting rapidly varying periods in unevenly sampled data ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : ficetlasso ] , and the impression is so different from the pdm result ( figure [ fig : ficetshpdm2 ] ) .",
    "however , we did nt widely used this method in selecting the aliases since our model used in lasso analysis also assumed temporarily uncorrelated observations , and the suppression of the aliases is simply a result of highly non - linear characteristics of compressed sensing . this figure ( if compared to classical figures ) would give misleading impression that there is no possibility for aliases and we have not used this type of figure in this paper .",
