    "the trapped ion system is one of the most promising candidates for quantum computation@xcite . in the system ,",
    "each qubit is formed by the long lived internal atomic levels of each ion , and laser beams have been used to manipulate quantum states of ions@xcite .",
    "different theoretical schemes have been proposed for quantum gate operations with the aid of the ion s collective motions@xcite and many have been experimentally demonstrated with small numbers of qubits @xcite .    to make a quantum computer have practical value , scalability of proposed architectures to many qubits",
    "is of central importance .",
    "however , scaling up to tens of qubits in ion - trapped system proves to be a great challenge and many efforts have been done in this area .",
    "the main difficulty of the scalability is that the sideband addressing , which is believed to be necessary in the gate operations proposed in most schemes , becomes impossible as the ion number increase .",
    "there are two promising approaches in literature to overcome this scalar difficulty .",
    "one is to divide the trapped - ion quantum computer into operation region and memory region .",
    "quantum gate operations are always implemented at the operation region where only a few ions form a small linear ion chains , while ions can be shuttled between the operation and memory regions @xcite .",
    "the other promising approach is to use appropriately shaped laser pulses to realize high - fidelity conditional quantum gates , where all phonon modes are considered in the gate operations even in a very large linear ion crystal@xcite .",
    "this approach may be significantly strengthened in an improved scheme @xcite where the tightly confined transverse modes@xcite are used to mediate quantum gate operations and an anharmonic trap potential is proposed to arrange the ions in a uniformly - spaced linear crystal . in this approach , the gate operation has a local character so that the complexity of the operations does not depend on the chain size@xcite .    to date most studies",
    "are limited to system of the linear trap with ions laser - cooled and confined in one dimensional crystals , little attention has been payed to the two - dimensional crystals@xcite . today",
    "penning trap can confine a large number of ions ( @xmath0 ) by a potential with approximate cylindrical symmetry @xcite . in penning trap , axial confinement",
    "is realized by a static electric field , while radial trap potential is induced by the rotations of the ions under an axial magnetic field . under certain parameters",
    "the ions will be arrayed in a two - dimensional plane with separation of order of tens of microns , such that they are individually addressable by optical means . although the rotation of the ion crystal may induce additional technical difficulty in the addressing of the ions , quantum manipulation of such qubits is still possible .",
    "particularly it has been proposed that the axial phonon modes , which are independent on the phonon modes in the planar direction since the anharmonic effects of phonon modes are negligible , can be used in the conditional gate operations@xcite",
    ". however , the phonon modes in a two - dimensional crystal are much more complicated than that of a linear ion crystal , and such complex mode spectrum makes it more difficult to resolve individual modes for quantum gate operations .",
    "clearly the two - dimensional penning trap may provide an almost ideal system for scalable quantum computation and quantum simulation if the aforementioned difficulty of sideband addressing can be overcome .",
    "therefore , a practical scheme to achieve the conditional gate operations without sideband addressing , which has not been touched before in such large scale two - dimensional traps , is highly needed .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a feasible scheme to implement high - fidelity conditional phase gates without sideband addressing in the scalable two - dimensional traps .",
    "we investigate in detail the configurations of the ions as well as the normal modes of the two - dimensional crystals .",
    "this scheme uses the ion s motion along the axial direction .",
    "although the effects of phonon modes in the planar direction can be neglected , the axial phonon mode spectrum is still too complicated to be resolved in the gate operations .",
    "we show that the local modes suggested in ref.@xcite can also be applied to mediate the interaction between ion and laser beams , so that the complexity of the quantum gate does not increase with the size of the system .",
    "compared to the scheme proposed in ref@xcite , we can implement conditional gate faster by optimally controlling the pulse shape .",
    "since the nearest - neighbor entangling quantum gates are sufficient for fault - tolerant quantum computing in two dimensional trap , in sharp contrast to one dimensional chain where the nearest - neighbor entangling quantum gates are insufficient@xcite , the generalization to two dimensional trap proposed here will be very useful .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "slowromancap2@ we study the equilibrium positions of the ions trapped in the two dimensional penning trap . in sec .",
    "slowromancap3@ we present the normal modes of the trapped ions and especially investigate the properties of the axial modes in detail . in sec .",
    "slowromancap4@ we show how to implement the conditional phase gates with high fidelity using the axial modes .",
    "a summary of our results and a conclusion are presented in sec .",
    "the system we have in mind is a two - dimensional trap @xcite with @xmath1 ions confined in a harmonic external potential . including their mutual coulomb repulsion interaction the potential energy of ions",
    "is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the position of the @xmath4th ion , @xmath5 is the mass of each ion , @xmath6 is the electron charge , @xmath7 is the permittivity of free space and @xmath8 is the distance between the @xmath4-th and @xmath9-th ions . here",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11 is the trap frequency which characterizes the strength of the trapping potential in the @xmath12 direction . in the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is a measure of the trap anisotropy and it will uniquely determine the ionic crystal structure for given @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "similarly to what they do in ref@xcite for the 1d linear case , to determine the equilibrium positions of ions , we may expand the position of the @xmath4th ion around its equilibrium position @xmath16 as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a small displacement .",

    ". the 1d case has been extensively studied , but less work focussing on the 2d traps@xcite . in this paper",
    "we pay attention to the latter .",
    "assume that @xmath30 is strong enough such that the configuration of ions in a 2d plane is always stable ( the detailed requirement will be addressed below ) , then the equilibrium positions are confined in @xmath31 plane and @xmath32 for an arbitrary ion . under this condition ,",
    "the equilibrium positions in @xmath31 plane may be determined by solving eq.([u_x ] ) and eq.([u_y ] ) .",
    "the solutions are not unique , for instance , ions for @xmath33 may locate at the vertexes of a triangle and its center point or locate at the vertexes of a square .",

    "were directly observed , especially a single plane hexagonal structure was observed , which is the configuration we want to utilize . for concreteness , in this paper we study the case where finite ions form the symmetric triangular lattice , such as the ion numbers are @xmath36 . the configuration for @xmath37 is shown in fig .",

    "1 , the lattice spacings are not constant .",
    "as the ions get farther from the center , the lattice spacings become larger ; however , it is almost constant near the crystal center and we get a nice triangular lattice at the center that can be suitable for the implementation of quantum computation .     in a 2d harmonic trap .",

    "the distances between the ions depend on the strength of the confining potentials as well as the number of ions .",
    "actually the minimum value @xmath48 of the dimensionless distance between two adjacent ions descends as the total number of the ions is increased . by numerical fit from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , we find it obeys the relation @xmath51 , which is a slower rate than @xmath52@xcite in the linear chain case .",

    "we assume that the parameter @xmath15 is larger then the critical values .",
    "the spectrum of the axial modes exhibits some typical features : the center of mass mode at @xmath30 is the highest frequency axial mode , while the frequency splitting between the center of mass mode and the second - to highest mode is the maximum , and the splitting will become smaller when increasing @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",

    ", the dimensionless distance between the pairs of ions is increasing in sequence .",
    "we observe several main features : ( i ) for both values of @xmath55 , it is clear that the gate fidelities decrease with the increasing of the distance between the pair of ions . especially for @xmath133 ,",
    "the fidelity decreases relatively quickly with the distance between ions , for example , the fidelity is about @xmath134 for the 1st pair of ions , while it becomes @xmath135 for the 10th pair of ions .",
    "in addition , the laser powers required for the cpf gates generally increase with the distance between the pair of ions .",
    "( ii ) to understand the influence of minimum ionic separation to the gate fidelity , all gates are performed with two different trap frequency @xmath55 .",
    "one frequency is set as @xmath125 , and the other @xmath136 , then the corresponding minimum separation are @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively . from the table we can see that under condition of the same gate time and @xmath30 , gate realized in the trap with larger minimum interior spacing will gain a higher fidelity .",
    "the physics behind it will be addressed late . on the other hand",
    ", it is worth to pointing out that , for pairs with lager distance , higher fidelity can be gained with lower @xmath55 or longer gate time , for example , taking gate time @xmath139 , the fidelity for the ion pair @xmath99 with @xmath136 will be above @xmath140 .",
    "plane represent the ions in the equilibrium positions and the @xmath84 values ( filled circles ) are the maximal deviation @xmath141 from the equilibrium position of the ions during the gate operation .",
    "( b ) the response of the ions located along the three lines drawn in fig .",
    "the @xmath142 for the target ions have been normalized to 1 .",
    "the fast decay of the response as one moves away from the target ions shows that the gate operation involves vibration of only local ions . ]",
    "the physics behind such high - fidelity is that the gate has a local character@xcite , i.e. , the contribution to the cpf gate comes primarily from the spin - dependent oscillations of the ions that are close to the target ions . to demonstrate the local properties of the quantum gates , we plot in fig .",
    "6 the response of each ion during the gate operation between the @xmath143th ion pair with @xmath125 .",
    "the figure explicitly exhibits the ultra fast decay of the ions response from the target ions .",
    "so the noises from the ionic vibration come just from the nearby ions .",
    "we have shown in table slowromancap1@ that the fidelity would be higher for a smaller @xmath55 , since the ion spacings are less in the larger @xmath55 .",
    "we have calculated the response of all ions for different @xmath55 , and find that @xmath144 of the nearby of the target ions for @xmath145 is larger of about @xmath146 than that of @xmath147 .",
    "so one can understand that the fidelity would be lower by the increasing of the frequency @xmath55 .",
    "attributing to this local character of the gate operations , two notable advantages appear for the quantum computation : ( i ) the complexity of a gate operation in the two - dimensional traps does not depend on the system size , in sharp contrast to the schemes based on side - band addressing .",
    "( ii ) the gates on the ions in different regions in the two - dimensional traps can be performed in parallel .",
    "the generalization of local gate operations from the linear trap@xcite to two dimensional trap may have advantages in the fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "it is well known that the set of quantum gates with local entangling quantum gates and single - bit gates are universal for quantum computation .",
    "furthermore , it would be useful for large - scale fault - tolerant quantum computing if the entangling quantum gates can be realized for any pair of qubits .",
    "however , although the quantum gates for any pair of ions in a large scale two dimensional trap are possible , they are slow and costly in the sense that the laser powers should be larger and the control parameters should be increased if the distance between ions are large . in this case , an important question is whether it is still possible to perform large - scale fault - tolerant quantum computing with quantum gates that perform only on the ions with the distance much smaller than the size of the trap .",
    "the recent studies@xcite have shown that in a two - dimensional lattice , even with only nearest - neighbor quantum gates , the error threshold can be still close to a percent level , which is basically as good as the case with arbitrary nonlocal gates , while the nearest - neighbor quantum gates are not sufficient for fault - torrent quantum computing in one dimensional chain .",
    "so the generalization of trapped ion quantum computation to two dimensional trap is highly deserved .",
    "in summary , we have explicitly exhibited the configuration of the two dimensional trap and the equilibrium positions of the ions trapped in small ion number by numerical simulation , and then examined the condition on which all ions are confined in a plane .",
    "after investigating the properties of the axial modes of the trapped ions , we have shown through explicit examples and calculations that it is feasible to perform high fidelity cpf gate in the penning traps using the axial modes , and the gate has a local character as in the linear chain case .",
    "the results suggest a realistic prospect for realization of large scale quantum computation in the penning traps architecture .",
