    "this theorem , which we call the _ law of localization _ , is not only theoretically important , but also practically useful for examining real biological systems .",

    "see appendix for the @xmath36-matrix and the sensitivity matrix . s    in general , response to perturbations in chemical reaction networks exhibits two characteristics , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 means that the influence of the perturbations is confined in a finite region in a network .",
    "in other words , the naive intuition that a perturbation in an upper part of a reaction network influences all of the lower parts is incorrect .",
    "the @xmath1 implies that the nonzero response patterns under perturbations of different reaction rates exhibit inclusion relations among them .",
    "from the @xmath36-matrix , we can generally prove a theorem , the _ law of localization _ , that determines the extent to which a perturbation influences in a network .",
    "we call a subnetwork satisfying this condition `` output - complete . '' for such a subnetwork @xmath44 , we count the number @xmath45 of elements in @xmath46 , the number @xmath47 of elements in @xmath48 , and the number @xmath49 of the closed cycles that consist of the reaction subset @xmath48 . then , we compute an index , @xmath50 which is analogous to euler characteristic and generally non - negative .",
    "the _ law of localization _ states that if @xmath51 for an output - complete subnetwork @xmath44 , then any perturbation of reactions in @xmath44 does not change the concentrations and the fluxes outside of @xmath44 , namely the perturbation effect is localized in @xmath44 itself .",
    "we call an output - complete subnetwork satisfying @xmath51 _ buffering structure_.    _ proof. _ the theorem is proved from the distribution of nonzero entries of the @xmath23-matrix .",
    "( i ) suppose a subnetwork @xmath52 is a buffering structure . then by appropriately choosing a basis of the kernel of @xmath53 and the orderings of the indices of the @xmath23-matrix , we can always rewrite the @xmath23-matrix as [ agamma ] the lower left block vanishes because @xmath23 is output - complete .",
    "( ii ) as explained already , the concentration change @xmath54 is proportional to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the minor matrix associated with the row of the @xmath12-th reaction and the column of the @xmath57-th metabolite . then , @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 follows because the upper left block in the minor @xmath56 , which was originally square in , is horizontally long .",
    "@xmath61    we illustrate the _ law of localization _ in the example networks in fig .",
    "[ fig : nw ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nw3 ] ( left ) .",
    "@xmath62 : the network includes two buffering structures , @xmath63 and @xmath64 which are minimum buffering structures including only a single chemical and a single output reaction .",
    "the _ law of localization _ claims that the perturbation to reaction 2 in @xmath65 influence only the inside of @xmath66 , namely the concentration of a. note the flux 2 in @xmath67 does not change in order to keep the outside of @xmath67 unchanged ) .",
    "we actually observed the predicted response in .",
    "generally , a perturbation to a reaction which is a single output from a chemical influences the substrate concentration only .",
    "@xmath68 : in addition to the 3 minimal buffering structures , @xmath69 , the network has two larger ones , @xmath70 ( with @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 ) .",
    "@xmath74 is the minimum buffering structure including reaction 4 .",
    "then , the _ law of localization _ predicts that the nonzero response to perturbation of reaction 4 should be limited within @xmath74 , which is observed in the 4th column in .",
    "similarly , the response to perturbation of reaction 6 is explained by @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath43 : the network has 14 buffering structures , listed in appendix . to examine the response hierarchy , we focus on the three buffering structures colored in fig . [",
    "fig : nw3 ] ; @xmath76 ( with @xmath77 ) , @xmath78@xmath79 ( with @xmath80@xmath81 ) , and @xmath82 ( with @xmath83@xmath84 ) .",
    "each of these three explains the response pattern under perturbation of reaction 5 , 8 , and 10 ( or 13 ) , respectively , and they satisfy an inclusion relation , @xmath85 .",
    "accordingly , we can see from fig . [",
    "fig : nw3 ] ( right ) that these response patterns satisfy an inclusion relation .    in this way",
    ", we understand all of the observed patterns from network topology by using the _ law of localization_. in short , the first characteristic , @xmath0 , is explained from the existence of buffering structures .",
    "the second property , @xmath1 , is explained as the nest of the buffering structures .",
    "finally , as an application to real biological networks , we examine the carbon metabolism pathway of @xmath86 .",
    "the network is a major part of the energy acquisition process , and the basic structures are shared between bacteria and human beings .",
    "[ fig : zu1 ] shows the network @xcite , including 28 metabolites and 46 reactions , and fig .",
    "[ fig : zu2 ] shows the response hierarchy ( see appendix for the detail ) .",
    "again , the response patterns exhibit the two characteristic features , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the network has 17 buffering structures , and the existence and the nest of them explain the two characteristic features perfectly .",
    "we mention that some of the buffering structures , which are of course defined from network topology , surprisingly overlap biologically identified sub - circuits , the pentose phosphate pathway ( yellow in fig .",
    "[ fig : zu1 ] , [ fig : zu2 ] ) , the tricarboxylic acid cycle ( blue ) and the glycolysis ( green ) .",
    "this correspondence may be understood from an evolutional point of view by considering the advantage of buffering structures .",
    "here we discuss the biological significances of buffering structures ( and nest of them ) in two different levels .",
    "the first discussion is on the physiological importance .",
    "a buffering structure prohibits influence of given perturbation from expanding to the outside , like a `` firewall . '' in other words , it is a substructure with robustness emerging from the network topology .",
    "the carbon metabolism network of e. coli possesses multiple nested firewalls ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zu2 ] ) , and are expected to be robust to fluctuations of enzymes in it .",
    "we expect that such a topological characteristic of reaction networks could be the evolutionary origin of homeostasis in biological systems .",
    "a set of chemical reactions satisfying the condition of buffering structure by chance in evolutionarily early time would be positively selected as an advantageous circuit .",
    "we then expect that buffering structures in existing biological networks today might be generated and selected in such ways .",
    "the second discussion is about practicality of the _ law of localization _ in experimental biology .",
    "our knowledge of biochemical networks is considered incomplete : there might exist unidentified reactions or regulations .",
    "the condition for buffering structure depends on the local network structure only , which implies that we can study the sensitivity of the system only from local information on the network .        from this property",
    ", we can determine a `` true '' network by combining experiments as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strategy ] .",
    "if a given perturbation ( knock down or overexpression ) to a predicted buffering structure , determined from network topology , @xmath87 influence outside of the buffering structure , then there must be inconsistency between the database information and the actual network .",
    "the mismatch must exist inside of the candidate structure , i.e. there must be unknown reactions or unknown regulations inside ( or emanating from ) the candidate subnetwork . by repeating theoretical predictions and experimental verifications",
    ", we can determine the `` true '' network from a partial network to the whole network in a step - by - step manner , i.e. from smaller to larger buffering structures .",
    "our theory must promote the understanding of reaction networks in both the theoretical and experimental levels by directly connecting the network topology with behaviors of the systems .    using a different method , steuer _ et al .",
    "_ studied a mathematical criteria for `` perfect adaptation , '' where changing a rate constant in one part of the network does not affect steady - state concentrations or fluxes , which in fact , is a subpart of the phenomena we studied in this paper .",
    "there are at least three large differences : ( i ) we studied not only perfect adaptation , but also any qualitative responses ( increase / decrease / invariant ) , ( ii ) while steuer et al.s method needs to examine a condition one by one for each pair of perturbation and chemicals , our method determines changes of all concentrations and fluxes by each perturbation of all reaction rates simultaneously via .",
    "( iii ) we found and proved a general law which claims that the property of perfect adaptation emerges from local topology of network . despite these differences , it would be interesting to explore relations between two mathematical theories .",
