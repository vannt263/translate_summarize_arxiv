    "the atlas detector at cern is one of two large general purpose detectors at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , a 7 tev on 7 tev proton accelerator .",
    "it was designed to have excellent tracking , calorimetry and muon spectroscopy over the entire energy range of the lhc allowing discovery of any new physics in that range .",
    "particular discovery potentials include details of the standard model and beyond , such as discovery of the higgs boson , supersymmetry ( susy ) and extra dimensions .",
    "more complete discussion of the physics discovery potential of atlas is given in reference @xcite .",
    "the atlas detector , under construction for well over a decade , was ready to record collision events on september 10 , 2008 when the lhc started up .",
    "single beams were circulated around the accelerator and resulting events were recorded in the detector . as is well known , about one week later , an incident in a superconducting splice between two dipoles resulted in a shutdown of the machine before any beam collisions occurred",
    ". this shutdown is still continuing and atlas has used this time to fix minor problems with the detector and commission the subsystems with cosmic ray events . the lhc accelerator is now scheduled to start again in november , 2009 .",
    "this paper will describe the current state of each subsystem and present results of these cosmic ray events showing that atlas now fully ready for collision data that is expected later this year .",
    "the atlas detector is large in more than one way : the outer dimensions ( a cylinder 44 m long and 25 m in diameter ) and the collaboration : over 2500 scientists from nearly 200 institutes in 37 countries . an overview schematic of the detector is shown in  fig .",
    "[ atlas_detector ] where the major subsystems are labelled .",
    "the outermost part of atlas is the muon spectrometer and its associated superconducting toroidal magnets which give atlas its name : a toroidal lhc apparatus .",
    "the key design in the muon spectrometer is minimal material provided by having air - core toroidal magnets .",
    "next , moving inward is the calorimeter system consisting of three different technologies .",
    "the hadronic calorimeter is a scintillating tile / iron structure covering @xmath0 . in the endcap region",
    "@xmath1 hadronic calorimetry is provided by a copper / liquid argon structure providing four longitudinal samples .",
    "forward hadronic calorimetry is provided by a tungsten / liquid argon structure covering @xmath2 with three longitudinal samples .",
    "electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by a lead / liquid argon detector @xmath3 with three longitudinal samples together with a presampler detector in the @xmath4 region .",
    "inside of the calorimeter is the inner detector consisting of a transition radiation tracker ( trt ) , semiconductor tracker , and a pixel detector shown in fig .",
    "[ inner_detector ] .",
    "the magnetic field for the inner detector is provided by a solenoid magnet providing a 2 tesla field .",
    "the trt provides @xmath5 separation over the energy range @xmath6 gev .",
    "the pixel readout has 80 million channels , another one of the superlatives in atlas .",
    "complete details of the atlas detector are given in reference @xcite",
    "during the brief single beam running in september , 2008 , atlas recorded many events from beam halo ( interactions with gas in the beam pipe ) and so called beam - splash events produced when the beam was run into a collimator approximately 150 m upstream of the detector .",
    "the beam splash events provided rather spectacular event display pictures , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ splash_event ] , but also allowed time synchronization between the subsystems and the lhc machine .",
    "since the end of the beam in sept . 2008 , atlas has been accumulating cosmic ray events in all subsystems of the detector .",
    "[ cosmic_runs ] shows the running periods and the state of the magnets during each run . over 200 million events",
    "have been recorded .",
    "the following sections will review the status of each atlas subsystem and show results from these cosmic ray runs .",
    "the atlas inner detector has three major detector components : the pixel detector , the silicon detector and the transition radiation tracker as shown above in fig .",
    "[ inner_detector ] .",
    "the pixel detector currently has approximately @xmath7 live channels , a hit efficiency of @xmath8 and a noise occupancy of @xmath9 the semiconductor tracker has over @xmath10 of its 6 million channels operational .",
    "the noise occupancy is @xmath11 in the barrel region and @xmath12 in the endcap .",
    "the transition radiation tracker ( trt ) has @xmath13 of its 350k channels operational .",
    "the transition radiation aspects of the trt have been proven in testbeam studies where the full turn on of transition radiation is seen and in the cosmic ray runs where the beginning of the turn on is seen .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ trt_muons ] where the probability of a signal above the high threshold is shown as a function of the lorentz gamma factor of the cosmic muon .",
    "transition radiation photons produced by particles with high gamma - factor cause a larger energy deposition in the straw tubes of the 1000 trt .",
    "the atlas liquid argon ( lar ) calorimeter systems , described above and shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ calorimeter ] , has @xmath14 of channels operational .",
    "the hadronic tile calorimeter has @xmath15 dead channels , which will be fixed at the next shutdown .",
    "the electronic calibration systems for all the calorimeter systems are fully operational .",
    "an example of studies with cosmic rays is shown in fig .",
    "[ lar_response ] , where the response of the lar barrel electromagnetic calorimeter is shown as a function of pseudorapidity .",
    "here the response is the most probable value ( mpv ) determined by two different algorithms .",
    "the larmuid algorithm is a variable size algorithm - only cells above a given threshold are added to the cluster .",
    "the 3x3 cluster algorithm is fixed in size .",
    "also shown are the true cluster response from monte carlo simulation and the cell depth .",
    "the data match the simulation and follow the cell depth as expected .",
    "the uniformity of response agrees with the simulation at the @xmath16 level .",
    "point between 0.3 and 0.4,width=302 ]",
    "the muon spectrometer in atlas has two different technologies for the precision measurement and two for the trigger as shown in fig .",
    "[ muon_detector ] . the monitored drift tube ( mdt ) system together with the cathode strip chambers ( csc ) in the forward region provide a spatial resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "the mdt tubes are `` monitored '' by a 12232 channel optical alignment system which provides position accuracy of @xmath18 .",
    "the mdt system has @xmath19 dead channels .",
    "the csc system has @xmath20 dead channels .",
    "the muon trigger is provided by resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) in the barrel and thin gap chambers ( tgc ) in the endcap .",
    "these provide a spatial resolution of @xmath21 mm and a time resolution sufficient to allow bunch crossing identification with the @xmath22 ns bunch crossing time of the lhc .",
    "the rpc system has @xmath23 channels operational with an additional @xmath24 recoverable during a shutdown .",
    "the tgc system is @xmath25 operational with less than @xmath26 noisy channels .",
    "overall , the muon system provides a stand alone ( that is , not combined with inner detector measurements ) resolution of @xmath27 up to 1 tev .",
    "a typical cosmic ray muon seen in the spectrometer is shown in fig .",
    "[ muon_event ] . as can been seen by the track bending ,",
    "the magnetic field was on for this event .",
    "effects of the muon alignment system can be seen in fig .  [ muon_residuals ] where the sagitta measured in the bend plane of the magnet is shown from tracks that go through one particular chamber in the muon barrel system .",
    "the top plot in that figure shows the sagitta with just the nominal geometry for the chambers that the track passes through . the middle plot shows the sagitta after corrections given by the optical alignment system .",
    "the bottom plot shows the final distribution obtained after applying corrections from track - based alignment .",
    "for this analysis , 3.5 million cosmic ray events which passed the high - level trigger track reconstruction in the barrel inner detector were used . after filtering for electromagnetic cluster candidates with transverse energy above @xmath283 gev and with a loose track match in @xmath29 ( pointing downwards ) , about 11 000 candidates remain .",
    "these remaining events are required to satisfy medium electron cuts ( lateral shower shapes in first and second layers of em calorimeter and track- cluster matching in @xmath30 for tracks with at least 25 trt hits ) and are then split into two categories : a ) a sample consisting of 1229 muon bremsstrahlung candidates , with only one track reconstructed in the barrel inner detector b ) a sample consisting of 85 ionisation electron candidates , with at least two tracks reconstructed in the barrel inner detector        in fig .",
    "[ electrons_1 ] , the red boxes correspond to candidates satisfying additional cuts defined for standard tight high@xmath31 electron identification in atlas at @xmath32 .",
    "these cuts are @xmath33 and @xmath34-dependent and the ones applied to most of the events are illustrated by the dashed red lines in figures  [ electrons_1 ] and [ electrons_2 ] : @xmath35 and high to low - threshold trt hit ratio @xmath36 ( indicating the detection of transition radiation produced only by relativistic particles ) .",
    "most of the events in the muon bremsstrahlung sample have small e / p and few high - threshold trt hits ( only muons above 100 gev momentum are expected to produce transition radiation ) .",
    "the events with low e / p and high trt ratio contain a large fraction of muons with combined momentum measured in the muon spectrometer and i d above 100 gev .",
    "only 19 of the 1229 events satisfy the signal criteria . in contrast ,",
    "in the electron ionisation sample , a large fraction of events , 36 out of a total of 85 , satisfy the signal criteria .",
    "these events are interpreted as high- energy @xmath37-rays produced in the inner detector volume by the incoming cosmic muons .            in fig .",
    "[ electrons_3 ] , the red curve is the projection of a two dimensional binned maximum likelihood fit to the two dimensional plot in fig .",
    "[ electrons_2 ] , excluding the signal candidates .",
    "the shape of the projected distributions is obtained from the muon bremsstrahlung sample , but the parameters are fitted using the ionisation sample .",
    "this fit is used as one of the methods to estimate the background contamination to the signal .",
    "a clear excess of events with a large ratio of high to low - threshold trt hits is observed , indicating the presence of an electron signal .",
    ", after applying the cut indicated on the ratio of high to low - threshold trt hits .",
    "the red curve shows the background , estimated as explained in fig .",
    "[ electrons_3 ] and projected on the e / p distribution .",
    "the background under the signal is estimated to be ( @xmath38 ) events , using this first method described above for fig .",
    "[ electrons_3].,width=302 ]    figure  [ electrons_4 ] , shows the distribution of energy to momentum ratio for the electrons candidates . a clear accumulation of signal events around e / p = 1 is observed , as expected for electrons .    a second independent method to estimate the background uses the measured ratio of negatively to positively charged muons coupled to the fact that the electron ionisation signal should contain no positrons : - the @xmath39 ratio obtained from the muon bremsstrahlung sample is @xmath40 - out of the 36 signal candidates , four have a positive charge , leading to an expectation of ( @xmath41 ) background events in the signal sample , in good agreement with the estimate from the first method",
    "the final sample consists of the 32 candidates with measured negative charge .",
    "due to space limitations , some systems of atlas have been omitted from this paper .",
    "notably the trigger system which has also been commissioned during this period and is also ready for fist collisions .",
    "in addition , the atlas distributed computing system , with its world - wide computing infrastructure , a crucial component of the analysis and data processing system , has been undergoing continuous commissioning .      we are greatly indebted to all cern s departments and to the lhc project for their immense efforts not only in building the lhc , but also for their direct contributions to the construction and installation of the atlas detector and its infrastructure .",
