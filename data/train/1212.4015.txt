    "contributions to the uncertainty in the selection efficiency due to particle identification and tracking are determined by using independent control samples .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath1  shape is determined by varying the fixed mass and width within its world average uncertainty  @xcite .",

    "finally , the uncertainty from neglecting interference between the four - pion final states is estimated by constructing a 4-body amplitude and generating samples of two four - pion final states , including detector effects .",
    "for each set of modes , we first calibrate the relative amplitude strength between the two considered modes in order to obtain a yield ratio as found in the data . for the calibration , we set the relative phase to @xmath401 .",
    "then , we generate sets with the relative phase between the two modes of interest varying from @xmath402 to @xmath403 in steps of @xmath404 . each set is fitted with an incoherent model and the rms of the variation of the fit results with respect to the one obtained from the calibration set is taken to be the systematic uncertainty .",

    "we find that interference with @xmath408 gives the largest uncertainty in all cases .    due to the combination of a broad ( non - resonant pion pair ) part together with a @xmath1  contribution ,",

    "including the helicity angles in the fit is the main difference with the previous belle analysis , where no such information was used . besides allowing us to measure the polarization , the helicity angles provide further separation power , especially between the four - pion final states , which otherwise can only be separated by the dipion masses .",
    "their importance is reflected by the result of the fit to data without using the helicity information ( see section  [ validity checks and significance ] ) .",
    "the stability of the fit result within the model shape studies ( see section  [ systematic uncertainties ] ) demonstrates the use of an appropriate helicity description .",

[ event selection ] ) and the replacement of a event - shape topology - dependent selection criteria with the inclusion of @xmath302 into the fit .",
