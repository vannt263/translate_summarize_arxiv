    "<S> the air - fluorescence yield is a key parameter for determining the energy scale of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays detected by fluorescence telescopes . a compilation of the available measurements of the absolute air - fluorescence yield normalized to its value in photons per mev for the 337  nm band at given pressure and temperature has been recently presented in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , in that paper , some corrections in the evaluation of the energy deposited in the corresponding experimental collision chambers have been proposed . in this note </S>",
    "<S> this comparison is updated . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a simple statistical analysis is carried out showing that our corrections favor the compatibility among the various experiments . as a result , an average value of 5.45  ph / mev for the fluorescence yield of the 337  nm band ( 20.1  ph / mev for the spectral interval @xmath0  nm ) at 1013  hpa and 293  k with an uncertainty of 5% is found . </S>",
    "<S> this result is fully compatible with that recently presented by the airfly collaboration ( still preliminary ) in such a way that including this latest result could even lowered the final uncertainty below the 5% level with high reliability .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    _ departamento de fsica atmica , molecular y nuclear , facultad de ciencias fsicas , universidad complutense de madrid , e-28040 madrid , spain _    the fluorescence technique has been proved to be very fruitful for the study of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> the air - fluorescence yield , defined as the number of fluorescence photons per unit deposited energy , is a key calibration parameter of the fluorescence telescopes . in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we presented a comparison between the laboratory measurements of the absolute air - fluorescence yield available in the literature normalized to common units ( photons / mev ) , air conditions ( dry air , 800  hpa and 293  k ) and wavelength interval ( 337  nm band ) . from the comparison of this normalized @xmath1 parameter , discrepancies larger than the quoted uncertainties of the measurements were found . according to the monte carlo analysis carried out in  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> non - negligible corrections in the evaluation of the energy deposition should be applied to these results , in particular in experiments where authors neglected the energy deposited outside the field of view of the light detector . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the proposed corrections are even larger than the quoted uncertainties in some cases ( i.e. , measurements of kakimoto  @xcite and lefeuvre  @xcite ) . as a result of these corrections , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 values get closer to each other in such a way that they are contained within the @xmath2  ph / mev interval at the above reference pressure and temperature  @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the calculations presented in  @xcite have been updated and the compatibility of the fluorescence yield results with and without our corrections has been evaluated quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> this has allowed to obtain a reliable @xmath1 value resulting from an average of the available absolute measurements . with respect to the mc analysis performed in  @xcite , some improvements in the algorithm for the evaluation of the energy deposited in the collision chamber of the experiments have been made . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the density correction on the cross section for the ionization processes leading to ejection of k - shell electrons , which was neglected in  @xcite , have been included in this work . </S>",
    "<S> these highly excited ions generate x rays which deposit all their energy within a very short distance . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the density correction for the k shell lowers the energy deposited by high - energy electrons ( gev range ) . </S>",
    "<S> geant4 simulations of energy deposition in air carried out by macfly  @xcite and airfly  @xcite are in agreement with our calculations at the level of 2% ( 1% ) for electron energies in the gev ( mev ) range .    in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : summary ] , we present the compilation of fluorescence yield values  @xcite with these updated corrections . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the fluorescence yield have been normalized to its value at 1013  hpa ( instead of 800  hpa as presented in  @xcite ) and 293  k. the latest result of airfly  @xcite carried out using 120  gev protons have been included in this compilation , but the impact on the average has been studied separately , as this value is still preliminary .    * </S>",

    "<S> results obtained at different energies have been averaged assuming a common systematic error . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in table  [ tab : average ] for both the uncorrected ( column  2 ) and corrected ( column  3 ) @xmath1 values together with the percentage uncertainty associated to each experiment ( column  4 ) .    * </S>",
    "<S> 4c experiment & @xmath10 ( ph / mev ) & @xmath11 ( ph / mev ) & quoted error + kakimoto  @xcite & 4.3 & 5.2 & 10% + nagano  @xcite & 5.0 & 5.4 & 13% + lefeuvre  @xcite & 5.4 & 5.8 & 5% + macfly  @xcite & 4.5 & 4.4 & 13% + flash  @xcite & 5.5 & 5.6 & 7.5% + airlight  @xcite & 5.8 & 5.4 & 16% + airfly  @xcite & 5.6 & - & @xmath9 +    [ tab : average ]    in the second place , the weighted average of the data sample shown in table  [ tab : average ] has been computed from    @xmath12    using as weights the reciprocal of the quoted square uncertainties ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if these @xmath14 are assumed to actually represent the variances of the corresponding ( normal ) probability distributions , our weighted mean would be the best estimator of the @xmath1 value with a variance given by @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that authors usually do not include any error contribution from the evaluation of the deposited energy , and thus , uncertainties are very likely underestimated , at least in some experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the @xmath16 statistic divided by the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath17 ) is found to be somewhat larger than 1 for the uncorrected sample . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , following the usual procedure , the variance of the weighted mean was corrected multiplying by @xmath17 , that is ,    @xmath18    data listed in table  [ tab : average ] for both the uncorrected and the corrected sample are plotted in figure  [ fig : average ] . the average value for the uncorrected @xmath1 sample ( figure  [ fig : uncorr ] ) is found to be @xmath19  ph / mev with @xmath20  ph / mev ( 4.4% ) and a @xmath17 value of 1.60 , whereas the corresponding results for the corrected sample ( figure  [ fig : corr ] ) are @xmath21=5.48  ph / mev , @xmath22  ph / mev ( 3.6% ) and @xmath17=1.07 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our corrections lead to a more consistent data sample suggesting that they do improve the determination of the deposited energy for the different experiments .    in the absence of other objective criteria , </S>",
    "<S> data have been weighted using the quoted experimental uncertainties , as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this weighting procedure has no significant effect on the final result . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , assuming the same weight ( i.e. , the same variance ) for all the experiments the results are @xmath23  ph / mev and @xmath24  ph / mev ( 5.0% error ) for the uncorrected data sample and @xmath25  ph / mev and @xmath22  ph / mev ( 3.8% error ) for the corrected one . </S>",
    "<S> the weighted sample mean turns out to be somewhat larger than the non - weighted mean mainly due to the high statistical significance of the results of lefeuvre  and flash , with the smallest associated uncertainties . in any case , a similar decrease in the standard deviation is found when corrections are applied whichever weights are chosen .    as a further test </S>",
    "<S> , it has been checked that the weighted mean of the corrected data sample does not change significantly if some measurement is excluded . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , removing the macfly result , which is the one showing the largest departure from the average , would lead to 5.61  ph / mev . instead , excluding the result of lefeuvre  , with a claimed uncertainty of 5% that is incompatible with our correction of 7% , </S>",
    "<S> an average fluorescence yield of 5.23  ph / mev is obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the energy ( in)dependence of the fluorescence yield in this data sample . </S>",
    "<S> several experiments have supported the assumed independence of the fluorescence yield at the level of about 10% in several energy intervals . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical analysis described in  @xcite predicts a slight increase ( @xmath26 ) with decreasing energies in the @xmath27  mev range , which is also compatible with experimental data ( see figure  [ fig : corr_e ] ) . in principle , this effect should be included in order to quantify the consistency of the available results . </S>",
    "<S> average values listed in table  [ tab : average ] have been recalculated by previously scaling all the measurements to a common electron energy of 100  mev according to the energy dependence predicted by our simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure  [ fig : corr_depe ] . </S>",
    "<S> this energy scaling slightly lowers the @xmath17 value ( from 1.07 down to 1.00 ) while both the average value and its uncertainty remain nearly unchanged ( from @xmath28 to @xmath29  ph / mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this result would support the weak energy dependence predicted by our simulation , we note that the evidence is still very weak and this small reduction of @xmath17 after the energy correction might have happened by chance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even if confirmed experimentally , this weak energy dependence would not have any relevant impact on the energy reconstruction of cosmic rays using the fluorescence technique .        </S>",
    "<S> taking into account all the above considerations , including the possible effects of the weak energy dependence of the fluorescence yield and the weighting procedure , a conservative result from our analysis is @xmath30  ph / mev with an estimated error of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> according to the comparison of our simulation of the energy deposition with geant4 , a small systematic uncertainty of below 2% should be added , although it does not affect the found improved compatibility of results ( i.e. , the @xmath16 values ) . the recent absolute measurement of the airfly collaboration  @xcite yields </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32  ph / mev with an uncertainty of @xmath9 ( still preliminary ) , which is fully compatible with the above value . </S>",
    "<S> if this new result is included in the average , then a weighted mean value of 5.52  ph / mev is obtained from  ( [ mean ] ) with an uncertainty of @xmath9 .    as already mentioned , for the comparison presented here we have normalized the air - fluorescence yield measurements to its value for the 337  nm band at 1013  hpa and 293  k. however , in some occasions it might be more convenient to use the integral of the fluorescence yield in a wider spectral range and/or other pressure and temperature conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the conversion can be easily done following the procedure described in detail in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the above average value would be of 20.1  ph / mev ( @xmath33 ) for the @xmath0  nm spectral range at the same reference pressure and temperature , which would become 20.3  ph / mev if the measurement of airfly is included .    </S>",
    "<S> our simulation can also provide a theoretical value of the air - fluorescence yield . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the evaluation of the fluorescence emission can not be very precise due to the large uncertainties in the relevant molecular parameters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect a large uncertainty in this calculation of the fluorescence yield , which we estimated to be about 25%  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a result for @xmath1 of 6.3  ph / mev has been found , which is consistent with the experimental ones , providing a valuable theoretical support to these measurements .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the corrections to the measurements of the absolute air - fluorescence yield discussed in  @xcite increase significantly the compatibility of the various experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> an average value of @xmath30  ph / mev with a 5% uncertainty has been obtained . </S>",
    "<S> if the absolute fluorescence yield and error of airfly are confirmed , a consensus on this important parameter with an uncertainty below the 5% level could be reached with high reliability . </S>"
