    "the gaussian interference channel is a basic mathematical model that characterizes many real - life communication systems with multiple uncoordinated users sharing a common spectrum to transmit independent information at the same time , such as the digital subscriber line ( dsl ) network @xcite , the ad - hoc wireless network @xcite , and the newly emerging cognitive radio ( cr ) wireless network @xcite . from an information - theoretical perspective , the capacity region of the gaussian interference channel , which constitutes all the simultaneously achievable rates of the users in the system , is still unknown in general @xcite , while significant progresses have recently been made on approaching this limit @xcite , @xcite .",
    "capacity - approaching techniques usually require certain cooperations among distributed users for their encoding and decoding . a more pragmatic approach that leads to suboptimal achievable rates of the users in the gaussian interference channel",
    "is to restrict the system to operate in a decentralized manner @xcite , i.e. , allowing only single - user encoding and decoding by treating the co - channel interference from the other users as additional gaussian noise at each user s receiver .",
    "in such a context , decentralized algorithms for users to allocate their transmit resources such as the power , bit - rate , bandwidth , and antenna beam to optimize individual transmission performance and yet to ensure certain fairness among all the users , become most important .",
    "this paper focuses on a multiuser multiple - input multiple - output ( mu - mimo ) wireless system , where multiple distributed links , each equipped with multiple transmit and/or receive antennas , share a common narrow band for transmission in a fully decentralized manner .",
    "in such a scenario , the system design reduces to finding a set of transmit covariance matrices for the users subject to their co - channel interference resulting from their simultaneous and uncoordinated transmissions .",
    "this design problem has been investigated in a vast number of prior works in the literature , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite , by treating the co - channel interference as additional colored noise at each user s receiver , i.e. , the conventional _ single - user decoder _ ( sud ) for the classic point - to - point mimo channel is applied . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed an algorithm , which is in spirit analogous to the iterative water - filling ( iwf ) algorithm in @xcite , for each distributed mimo link to iteratively update transmit covariance matrix to maximize individual transmit rate . distributed iterative beamforming ( the rank of transmit covariance matrix is restricted to be one ) algorithms were also studied in @xcite for transmit sum - power minimization given individual user s quality of service ( qos ) constraint in terms of the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "the throughput of decentralized mu - mimo systems has been further analyzed in @xcite and @xcite for the cases of fading channels and large - size systems , respectively . in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "centralized strategies were proposed where all users transmit covariance matrices are jointly searched to maximize their sum - rate , and numerical algorithms were also proposed to converge to a local sum - rate maxima . analyzing the decentralized mu - mimo system via a game theoretical approach has recently been done in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the cited papers on decentralized / centralized designs for the gaussian mimo interference channel have all adopted the sud at each user s receiver , whereas during the past decade multiuser detection techniques ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) have been thoroughly investigated in the literature , and have been proven in realistic multiuser / mimo systems to be able to provide substantial performance gains over the conventional sud .",
    "this motivates our work s investigation of the following question : considering a decentralized mu - mimo system where the users iteratively adapt their transmit covariance matrices for individual rate maximization , `` is applying multiuser detection at each user s receiver able to enhance the system throughput over the conventional sud ? ''",
    "note that because of the randomness of channels among the users , as well as their independent rate assignments , at one particular user s receiver , multiuser detection can be used to cancel the co - channel interference from some / all of its coexisting users only when their received signals are jointly decodable with this particular user s own received signal .",
    "thus , we refer to this decoding method as _ opportunistic multiuser detection _",
    "( omd ) . also note that the omd in the context of the decentralized mu - mimo system is analogous to the `` successive group decoder ( sgd ) '' in the fading multiple - access channel ( mac ) with unknown channel state information ( csi ) at the user transmitters ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . with the proposed omd",
    ", this paper derives the optimal transmit covariance matrix for user s individual transmit - rate maximization at each iteration of transmit adaptation . by simulation",
    ", this paper demonstrates the throughput gains of the converged users transmit covariance matrices with the proposed omd over the conventional sud .",

    "we consider two types of decoding methods at each user s receiver .",
    "one is the conventional sud , which has been applied in the above cited papers , where the @xmath27th user decodes its desired message by treating the co - channel interference from all the other users , @xmath39 , as additional colored gaussian noise @xmath46 .",
    "the other decoding method is the newly proposed omd , whereby each user opportunistically applies multiuser detection to decode some / all of its coexisting users messages so as to cancel their resulted interference , provided that these messages are jointly decodable with this user s own message . in practice , each user in the system is usually interfered with by all the other users , while due to location - dependent shadowing / fading , only a small group of coexisting users who are closest to one particular user and thus correspond to the strongest cross - link channels to this user , will contribute the most to this user s received co - channel interference . as a result , this user can effectively estimate the transmit rates as well as the cross - link channels of these `` strong '' interference users , and employ the proposed omd to suppress their interference at the receiver . note that the use of omd instead of sud still maintains the fully decentralized property of the existing iwf - like operation protocols given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the problem formulation as well as the solution to determine the optimal transmit covariance matrix of each user for individual transmit - rate maximization , when the proposed omd is employed . for the purpose of exposition , we consider the special case where only two users exist in the system .",
    "we will address the general case with more than two users in section [ sec : k users ] .",
    "for brevity , only user 1 s transmit adaptation is addressed here , while the developed results apply similarly to user 2 .      note that at one particular iteration of user 1 to update its transmission , user 2 s transmit covariance matrix , @xmath47 , and transmit rate , denoted by @xmath48 , are both fixed values . for a given transmit covariance matrix of user 1 , @xmath49 , the resultant maximum transmit rate of user 1",
    "can be expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51    the above result is illustrated in the following three cases corresponding to the three expressions of @xmath52 in ( [ eq : rate ] ) from top to bottom .    *",
    "_ strong interference case _ : in this case , the received signal from user 2 is decodable at user 1 s receiver with the conventional sud , by treating user 1 s signal as colored gaussian noise .",
    "this is feasible since @xmath53 given in ( [ eq : r(1 ) ] ) . after decoding user2 message and thereby canceling its associated interference",
    ", user 1 can decode its own message with a maximum rate equal to its own channel capacity .",
    "the above decoding method is known as _ successive decoding _ ( sd ) for the standard gaussian mac @xcite .",
    "* _ moderate interference case _ : in this case , @xmath54 and thus the received signal from user 2 is not directly decodable by the sud .",
    "however , since @xmath55 given in ( [ eq : r(2 ) ] ) , it is still feasible for user 1 to apply _ joint decoding _ ( jd ) @xcite to decode both users messages . in this case",
    ", the rate pair of the two users should lie on the @xmath56-degree segment of the corresponding mac capacity region boundary @xcite , i.e. , @xmath57 . * _ weak interference case _ : in this case , @xmath58 , i.e. , the received signal from user 2 is not decodable even without the presence of user 1 s signal . as such , user 1 s receiver has the only option of treating user 2 s signal as colored gaussian noise and applying the conventional sud to directly decode user 1 s message , the same as that in the existing iwf - like algorithms ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) .    in the above decoding method , multiuser detection is applied in both cases of strong and moderate interferences when @xmath55 , but not in the case of weak interference when @xmath58 .",
    "thus , user 1 s receiver opportunistically applies multiuser detection to decode user 2 s message , either successively ( sd ) or jointly ( jd ) with its own message .",
    "we thus refer to this decoding method as _ opportunistic multiuser detection _ ( omd ) . from ( [ eq : r(1 ) ] ) and ( [ eq : r(2 ) ] ) , it follows that @xmath59 .",
    "further more , it is easy to verify that @xmath52 given in ( [ eq : rate ] ) with the proposed omd is in general larger than the achievable rate with the conventional sud ( given by the third expression of @xmath52 in ( [ eq : rate ] ) independent of @xmath48 ) , for any given set of @xmath60 , and @xmath48 .    with @xmath61 given in ( [ eq : rate ] ) for a fixed @xmath49 , we can further maximize user 1 s transmit rate by searching over @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the transmit power constraint of user 1 .",
    "this problem can be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath61 is given in ( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "the optimal solution of @xmath49 in ( p1 ) and the corresponding maximum transmit rate of user 1 are denoted by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the solution of ( p1 ) for the optimal transmit covariance matrix of user 1 , when the proposed omd is deployed at user 1 receiver .",
    "note that although the constraints of ( p1 ) are convex , its objective function is not necessarily concave due to the fact that @xmath66 given in ( [ eq : r(1 ) ] ) is neither convex nor concave function of @xmath49 . as a result , ( p1 ) seems to be non - convex at a first glance .",
    "in fact , ( p1 ) is a convex optimization problem after being transformed into a convex form , as will be shown in this subsection . in the following",
    ", we will study the solution of ( p1 ) for two cases : @xmath58 and @xmath67 , for which the sud and the multiuser decoding ( md ) ( in the form of either sd or jd ) should be used to achieve @xmath68 given in ( [ eq : rate ] ) , respectively .      in this case , the sud should be applied .",
    "note that @xmath70 is a constant unrelated to @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the optimal @xmath49 that maximizes the third expression of @xmath61 in ( [ eq : rate ] ) has the following structure @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 with @xmath73 is obtained from the singular - value decomposition ( svd ) of the equivalent channel of user 1 ( after the noise whitening ) expressed as @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 with @xmath80 s obtained from the standard water - filling solution @xcite : @xmath81 with @xmath82 being a constant to make @xmath83 .",
    "the maximum rate of user 1 then becomes @xmath84      in this case , the md in the form of either sd or jd should be used . in order to overcome the non - concavity of @xmath61 given in ( [ eq : rate ] ) due to @xmath66 , we re -",
    "express the first two expressions of @xmath61 in ( [ eq : rate ] ) as @xmath85    thus , the maximum achievable rate of user 1 can be obtained as @xmath86 the maximization problem in ( [ eq : rate md ] ) can be explicitly written as @xmath87 the optimal solution of @xmath52 in ( p2 ) will be @xmath88 .",
    "note that ( p2 ) is a convex optimization problem since its constraints specify a convex set of @xmath89 . to solve ( p2 )",
    ", we apply the standard lagrange duality method @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce two non - negative dual variables , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , associated with the two rate constraints ( [ eq : rate constraint 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rate constraint 2 ] ) , respectively , and write the associated lagrangian of ( p2 ) as @xmath92 by reordering the terms in ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , we obtain @xmath93 the lagrange dual function of ( p2 ) is then defined as @xmath94 where the set @xmath95 specifies the remaining constraints of ( p2 ) given in ( [ eq : other constraints ] ) .",
    "the dual problem of ( p2 ) , of which the optimal value is the same as that of ( p2 ) , is defined as @xmath96    let @xmath97 and @xmath98 denote the optimal solutions of ( p2 ) .",
    "let @xmath99 and @xmath100 denote the optimal dual solutions of the dual problem ( p2-d ) .",

    "given lemma [ lemma : optimal mu ] , without loss of generality , we can replace @xmath91 by @xmath102 in ( [ eq : lagrangian new ] ) .",
    "thus , the maximization problem in ( [ eq : lagrange dual ] ) can be equivalently rewritten as ( by discarding the constant term @xmath103 ) @xmath104    further more , the dual problem ( [ eq : dual problem ] ) now only needs to minimize @xmath105 ( since @xmath106 ) over @xmath107 .",

    "this suggests that @xmath145 , i.e. , sd is optimal .",
    "however , the optimal solution @xmath98 of ( p2 ) , or that of ( p3 ) with @xmath146 , denoted by @xmath147 , in general does not have any closed - form expression , and thus needs to be obtained by a numerical search . since ( p3 ) is convex , the interior - point method @xcite can be used to efficiently obtain its solution for a given @xmath90 .",

    "furthermore , each element of the two users direct - link channels is assumed to have the variance @xmath202 and @xmath203 , for user 1 and 2 , respectively ; and each element of the two cross - link channels has the variance , @xmath204 for the channel from user 1 to user 2 and @xmath205 for the channel from user 2 to user 1 , respectively . in total , 5000 independent channel realizations are simulated over which each user s achievable average rate is computed . for each channel realization ,",
    "the two users iteratively update their transmit covariance matrices until their rates both get converged .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath206 .    in fig . [",
    "fig : sum rate ] , the achievable average sum - rate of the two users is shown for a symmetric system and channel setup , where @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 .",
    "the user sum - rate is plotted against @xmath210 to investigate the effect of the interference between the two users on their achievable sum - rate .",
    "it is observed that the sum - rate with the proposed omd improves over that with the conventional sud for all the values of @xmath210 , while the rate gains become more substantial in the case of large values of @xmath210 , i.e. , the `` strong '' interference case . with sud",
    ", it is observed that the sum - rate first decreases with increasing of @xmath210 ( as a result of interference whitening ) , and then starts to increase with @xmath210 ( as a result of interference avoidance ) , and finally gets converged for large values of @xmath210 ( due to the fact that zero - forcing ( zf ) -based receive beamforming to completely null the co - channel interference becomes optimal at the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) region ) .",
    "however , the sum - rate with the proposed omd is observed to increase consistently with @xmath210 , due to the fact that when the co - channel interference becomes stronger at the receiver , the omd more easily decodes the interference .",
    "next , we consider a special scenario of the general system model studied in this paper . in this case ,",
    "a `` cognitive radio ( cr ) '' type of newly emerging wireless system is considered , where user 1 is the so - called primary ( non - cognitive ) user ( pu ) who is the legitimate user operating in the frequency band of interest , while user 2 is the secondary ( cognitive ) user ( su ) that transmits simultaneously with the pu over the same spectrum under the constraint that its transmission will not cause the pu s transmission performance to an unacceptable level @xcite .",
    "the pu is non - cognitive since it is oblivious to the existence of the su and applies the conventional sud at the receiver by treating the interference from the su as additional noise .",
    "while for the su , it is cognitive in the sense that it is aware of the pu and thus transmits with a much lower average power than that of the pu in order to protect the pu ; thus , for this example it is assumed that @xmath211 and @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is a given constant .",
    "in addition , since the su is cognitive , it may choose to use the more advanced omd at the receiver to cope with the interference from the pu .",
    "two cases are thus studied for this example : case ( i ) both user 1 and user 2 employ sud ; and case ( ii ) user 1 employs sud while user 2 employs omd .",
    "it is assumed that the su s link distance is much shorter than that of the pu link , and furthermore the su transmitter and receiver are both in the vicinity of the pu transmitter while they are both sufficiently far away from the pu receiver .",
    "thus , for this example we assume that @xmath214 , and @xmath215 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr rate ] , the achievable user individual rates are shown for different values of @xmath213 in both cases i and ii .",
    "it is observed that the achievable rate of user 2 ( the su ) improves significantly in case ii over case i , thanks to the use of omd instead of sud .",
    "this rate gain is substantial because the su receiver is close to the pu transmitter and thus @xmath204 is large , i.e. , the cross - link channel from pu to su is a `` strong '' interference channel , for which the omd is crucial for the su to mitigate the pu s interference .",
    "however , it is also observed that the achievable rate of user 1 ( the pu ) drops slightly in case ii as compared with case i. this is because that in case ii with omd , the su s transmitted signal has a more spatially spread - out spectrum than that in case i with sud , and so does the received su s interference at the pu receiver .",
    "nevertheless , due to the small value of @xmath205 or the weak cross - link channel from su to pu , the capacity loss of the pu is not significant , which justifies the operation principle of the su , i.e. , the pu transmission should be sufficiently protected .",
    "this paper studied a new decoding method , namely opportunistic multiuser detection ( omd ) , for the decentralized mu - mimo system where each user iteratively optimizes transmit covariance matrix for individual rate maximization . in comparison with the conventional single - user detection ( sud ) ,",
    "the proposed omd still allows a fully decentralized processing of each user in the system , while it improves the user s interference mitigation capability at the receiver , and leads to more optimum spatial spectrum sharing among the users .",
    "simulation results showed that substantial system throughput gains could be achieved by the proposed omd over the conventional sud , for certain application scenarios .",
    "we will prove lemma [ lemma : optimal mu ] by contradiction .",
    "first , suppose that @xmath216 .",
    "then , in the maximization problem of ( [ eq : lagrange dual ] ) , from the expression of @xmath217 in ( [ eq : lagrangian new ] ) , it follows that the optimal @xmath52 that maximizes the lagrangian is @xmath218 , which contradicts the fact that @xmath52 in ( p2 ) is upper - bounded by finite rate values in the constraints ( [ eq : rate constraint 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rate constraint 2 ] ) .",
    "second , suppose that @xmath219 . similarly like the previous case , it can shown that @xmath220",
    ". however , this can not be true since we can easily find a feasible solution set for @xmath89 in ( p2 ) such that @xmath221 . by combining the above two cases",
    ", it follows that @xmath101 .",
    "we rewrite @xmath120 in ( [ eq : r(1 ) bar ] ) and @xmath141 in ( [ eq : r(3 ) ] ) as @xmath222 since @xmath111 and @xmath125 are optimal for the sum - capacity ( in an equivalent two - user mimo - mac ) and user1 channel capacity ( without the presence of user 2 ) , respectively , we have @xmath223 combining the above two inequalities with ( [ eq : inequality 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : inequality 2 ] ) , it thus follows that @xmath142 .",
    "we first prove the former part of proposition [ proposition ] , i.e. , the set @xmath176 is unique , by contradiction .",
    "suppose that there exist two optimal decodable user sets for user 1 with the same size , denoted by @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "without loss of generality , we let @xmath226 and @xmath227 , where @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 are subsets consisting of completely different user indexes .",
    "then , we can express @xmath231 and @xmath232 , where @xmath233 . then , for users in the set @xmath224 , their transmit rates must satisfy @xcite @xmath234 similarly , for users in the subset @xmath230 of @xmath225 , their transmit rates must satisfy @xmath235 let @xmath236 be an orthogonal set of @xmath185 , where @xmath237 .",
    "similarly , @xmath238 is defined for @xmath239 , where @xmath240 .",
    "( [ eq : rate j ] ) and ( [ eq : rate i ] ) can thus be further shown as follows : @xmath241 @xmath242 from ( [ eq : rate j new ] ) and ( [ eq : rate i new ] ) , we obtain @xmath243 since @xmath244 from ( [ eq : rate i j ] ) and ( [ eq : rate i j new ] ) , it follows that @xmath245 thus , the set @xmath246 is a decodable user set for user 1 for any @xmath247 , and @xmath248 , and so is the set @xmath249 .",
    "since the size of @xmath250 is larger than that of @xmath224 or @xmath225 , this contradicts the assumption that @xmath224 and @xmath225 are optimal decodable user sets for user 1 .",
    "the proof of the former part of proposition [ proposition ] thus follows .",
    "next , we prove the latter part of proposition [ proposition ] , i.e. , any decodable user set for user 1 , @xmath169 , must be a subset of @xmath176 .",
    "the proof is also obtained via contradiction .",
    "suppose that there is a set @xmath169 that is not a subset of @xmath176 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can express @xmath251 and @xmath252 , where @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 are orthogonal subsets .",
    "based on the proof for the former part of proposition [ proposition ] , we know that the set @xmath253 is also a decodable user set for user 1 , and apparently , it has a larger size than @xmath176 , which contradicts the fact that @xmath176 is the optimal decodable user set for user 1 .",
    "the proof of the latter part of proposition [ proposition ] thus follows .",
    ".the algorithm to find @xmath176 .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]",
    "in this appendix , we present an algorithm to find the optimal decodable user set for user 1 , @xmath176 . first , some notations are given as follows for the convenience of presentation .",
    "let @xmath254 denote a subset of an arbitrary set @xmath180 , @xmath255 .",
    "note that here we have excluded the case that @xmath256 for the ease of presentation .",
    "the operation @xmath257 then stands for removing the subset @xmath254 from @xmath180 .    for a given user set ,",
    "@xmath258 , we know from definition [ def:1 ] that @xmath180 is a decodable user set for user 1 if and only if for any subset of @xmath180 , @xmath254 , it satisfies that @xmath259 however , if there exists a subset @xmath254 such that @xmath260 , it follows that @xmath180 should not be a decodable user set for user 1 . from the above property",
    ", we are able to design an iterative algorithm to find @xmath176 , which is explained as follows .",
    "initially , we let @xmath261 .",
    "thus , @xmath262 .",
    "then , we will sequentially check for all the subsets of @xmath180 whether @xmath263 . if this is the case",
    ", then we declare that @xmath264 .",
    "however , if we find any @xmath265 such that @xmath266 , then we conclude that @xmath180 should not be @xmath176 and furthermore @xmath267 . in this case",
    ", we will set @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and start a new sequence of tests for @xmath270 .",
