    "we introduce a novel approach in the context of the linearised stability analysis of generic dynamical spherically symmetric thin shells @xcite .",
    "the key point is to develop an extremely general and robust framework that can quickly be adapted to wide classes of generic thin - shell configurations .",
    "we consider standard general relativity , with the transition layer confined to a thin shell .",
    "the bulk spacetimes ( interior and exterior ) on either side of the transition layer will be spherically symmetric and static but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the thin shell ( transition layer ) will be permitted to move freely in the bulk spacetimes , permitting a fully dynamic analysis .",
    "this will then allow us to perform a general stability analysis , where the stability is related to the properties of the matter residing in the thin - shell transition layer .",
    "to set the stage , consider two distinct spacetime manifolds , an _ exterior _ @xmath0 , and an _ interior _",
    "@xmath1 , that are to be joined together across a surface layer @xmath2 .",
    "consider two generic static spherically symmetric spacetimes given by the following line elements : @xmath3 dt_{\\pm}^2 +   \\left[1-\\frac{b_{\\pm}(r_{\\pm})}{r_{\\pm}}\\right]^{-1}\\,dr_{\\pm}^2 + r_{\\pm}^2   d\\omega_{\\pm}^{2}\\ , , \\label{generalmetric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 refers to the exterior and interior geometry , respectively .",
    "a single manifold @xmath5 is obtained by gluing together @xmath0 and @xmath1 at their boundaries . using the darmois - israel formalism ,",
    "the surface stress components on the junction interface are given by @xmath6 , \\label{gen - surfenergy2 } \\\\ % % % { \\cal p}&=&\\frac{1}{8\\pi a}\\left [ \\frac{1+\\dot{a}^2+a\\ddot{a}-\\frac{b_+(a)+ab'_+(a)}{2a}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b_{+}(a ) } { a}+\\dot{a}^{2 } } }       + \\sqrt{1-\\frac{b_{+}(a)}{a}+\\dot{a}^{2 } } \\ ; a\\phi'_{+}(a ) \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & % \\hspace{-0.5 cm }   \\left . - \\frac{1+\\dot{a}^2+a\\ddot{a}-\\frac{b_-(a)+ab'_-(a)}{2a}}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b_{-}(a ) } { a}+\\dot{a}^{2 } } } - \\sqrt{1-\\frac{b_{-}(a)}{a}+\\dot{a}^{2 } } \\ ; a\\phi'_{-}(a ) \\right].\\label{gen - surfpressure2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the surface mass of the thin shell is given by @xmath7 .",
    "the conservation equation is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is related to the energy - momentum flux that impinges on the shell , and is given by @xmath11\\,.\\ ] ] the flux term @xmath10 is zero whenever @xmath12 ; this is actually a quite common occurrence , for instance in either schwarzschild or reissner  nordstrm geometries , or whenever @xmath13 , so it is very easy for one to be mislead by those special cases .    to analyse the stability of the thin shell , it is useful to rearrange the expression of @xmath14 into the form @xmath15 , where the potential @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 ^ 2-\\left[\\frac{b_{+}(a)-b_{-}(a)}{2m_{s}(a)}\\right]^2\\right\\}\\ , .",
    "\\label{potential}\\ ] ]    note that @xmath16 is a function of the surface mass @xmath18 .",
    "however , it is sometimes useful to reverse the logic flow and determine the surface mass as a function of the potential .",
    "thus , if we specify @xmath16 , this tells us how much surface mass we need to put on the transition layer , which is implicitly making demands on the equation of state of the matter residing on the transition layer .    to analyse the stability of the thin shell ,",
    "consider a linearisation around an assumed static solution , @xmath19 , where one taylor expands @xmath16 around @xmath19 to second order . now , expanding around a static solution @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 , so it is sufficient to consider @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the assumed static solution at @xmath19 is stable if and only if @xmath16 has a local minimum at @xmath19 , which requires @xmath23 .",
    "the condition @xmath23 will be our primary criterion for the thin shell stability , though it will be useful to rephrase it in terms of more basic quantities .",
    "for instance , it is useful to express @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which allows us to easily study linearised stability , and to develop a simple inequality on @xmath26 using the constraint @xmath27 .",
    "similar formulae hold for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and for @xmath32 , @xmath33 . in view of the redundancies coming from the relations @xmath34 and the differential conservation law , the only interesting quantities are @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the stability condition @xmath35 is given as an inequality on @xmath26 : @xmath36 ^ 2\\over[1-b_+(a_0)/a_0]^{3/2 } }   -   { [ b_-(a_0)- a_0 b_-'(a_0)]^2\\over[1-b_-(a_0)/a_0]^{3/2 } } \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & &   + { 1\\over2 }   \\left\\ {   { b_+''(a_0)\\over\\sqrt{1-b_+(a_0)/a_0 } }   - { b_-''(a_0)\\over\\sqrt{1-b_-(a_0)/a_0 } } \\right\\ } ,    \\label{stable_ddms1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided @xmath37 . if @xmath38 the direction of the inequality is reversed . in the absence of external forces",
    "this inequality is the only stability constraint one requires .",
    "however , once one has external forces ( @xmath39 ) , we have a second stability inequality : @xmath40''\\right|_{a_0 } & \\leq & \\left.\\left\\ {   \\phi_+'''(a ) \\sqrt{1-b_+(a)/a } -   \\phi_-'''(a ) \\sqrt{1-b_-(a)/a } \\right\\}\\right|_{a_0 } \\nonumber\\\\ & &   \\hspace{-2.0 cm } - \\left.\\left\\ {   \\phi_+''(a ) { ( b_+(a)/a)'\\over\\sqrt{1-b_+(a)/a } } -   \\phi_-''(a){(b_-(a)/a)'\\over\\sqrt{1-b_-(a)/a } } \\right\\}\\right|_{a_0 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-2.0 cm } -{1\\over4 }   \\left.\\left\\ {   \\phi_+'(a ) { [ ( b_+(a)/a)']^2\\over[1-b_+(a)/a]^{3/2 } } - \\phi_-'(a ) { [ ( b_-(a)/a)']^2\\over[1-b_-(a)/a]^{3/2 } } \\right\\}\\right|_{a_0 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-2.0 cm } -{1\\over2 }   \\left.\\left\\ {   \\phi_+'(a ) { ( b_+(a)/a)''\\over\\sqrt{1-b_+(a)/a } } - \\phi_-'(a ) { ( b_-(a)/a)''\\over\\sqrt{1-b_-(a)/a } } \\right\\}\\right|_{a_0 } ,     \\label{stability_xi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath41 . note that this last equation is entirely vacuous in the absence of external forces .",
    "we have developed a novel and extremely general and robust framework leading to the linearised stability analysis of dynamical spherically symmetric thin shells . a key point in the conservation law of the surface stresses is the presence of a flux term .",
    "more specifically , we have considered the surface mass as a function of the potential , so that specifying the latter tells us how much surface mass we need to put on the transition layer .",
    "this procedure demonstrates in full generality that the stability of the thin shell is equivalent to choosing suitable properties for the material residing on the thin shell .",
