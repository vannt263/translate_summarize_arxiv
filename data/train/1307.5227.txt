    "the study of piecewise - smooth differential equations is a relatively recent topic in field dynamical systems @xcite , despite their wide use in applied sciences and engineering .",
    "the dynamics generated by these equations displays many unexpected phenomena , including stick - slip transitions associated , for example , with solid friction forces @xcite and bifurcations that do not appear in the standard classification of catastrophes of smooth dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "they also show , in the case of systems with discontinuous derivatives or forces ( so - called filippov systems @xcite ) , multivalued solutions for a given initial condition , leading to a loss of determinism @xcite .",
    "stochastic versions of piecewise - smooth dynamical systems perturbed by noises are also used as models of physical and biological systems .",
    "stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) with piecewise - smooth drifts are commonly used , for example , in stochastic or brownian ratchets , which serve as models of diffusion and transport in a variety of biological motors @xcite .",
    "another important class of problem concerns diffusion of solid objects on solid surfaces , which can be modeled phenomenologically using piecewise - smooth sdes with solid friction forces @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in this case shows stick - slip transitions , as in the noiseless case , but also new features due to the noise such as directed motion in the absence of a mean force bias @xcite and noise - dependent decay of correlation functions @xcite .",
    "some of these features have been investigated experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the theory of piecewise - smooth sdes is only in its infancy compared to its noiseless counterpart .",
    "exact solutions for the transition probability distribution or propagator of a few simple piecewise - constant or piecewise - linear sdes are known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some studies have also looked at the large deviations of sdes with discontinuous drift ( so - called sdes with discontinuous statistics ) @xcite .",
    "however , from these disconnected studies it is not clear how nonsmooth sdes can be studied with techniques developed and used for smooth systems . here",
    "we focus on two such techniques , namely , the path integral representation of propagators and the weak - noise ( also called saddle - node or instanton ) approximation of these integrals @xcite .",
    "the weak - noise limit is particularly interesting from a physical point of view because a piecewise - smooth system does not necessarily behave continuously with the magnitude of a force or noise and may therefore behave in a non - trivial way in the limit of vanishing noise .",
    "this raises the question of the validity of the weak - noise limit for nonsmooth systems .    in this paper",
    ", we address this question in a practical way by studying a simple piecewise - constant sde , defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the sign of the state variable @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a positive constant , and @xmath4 is the strength of the gaussian white noise @xmath5 characterized by @xmath6 the notation @xmath7 stands for the average over the noise . physically , the sde ( [ eqlangevinonlydryfriction ] ) is the simplest model of stick - slip motion where @xmath2 represents the velocity of a solid object of unit mass sliding over a surface with solid ( also called dry or coulomb ) friction coefficient @xmath3 per unit mass @xcite .",

    "we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 \\label{eqexactsolutiondryfriction}\\ ] ] is the propagator in nondimensional units and @xmath13 is the error function . this propagator is obtained by explicitly solving the corresponding time - dependent fokker - planck equation , which in nondimensional units has the form @xmath14+\\frac{\\partial^2 } { \\partial x^2}\\hat{p}(x,\\tau|x',0).\\ ] ] taking the limit @xmath15 of @xmath8 , we obtain the stationary probability density function of eq .",

    ", we compare these exact results , which are valid for any noise power @xmath4 , with various low - noise approximations of the path integral representation of @xmath8 in order to test the validity and accuracy of these approximations and to discuss subtle singularities arising in the path integral when dealing with discontinuous drifts .",

    ", we will see that the weak - noise approximation gives the correct propagator at the lowest order in @xmath4 , as well as its main features with higher - order corrections , provided some heuristics are used to treat the singularities of the path integral .",
    "the higher - order corrections are able , in particular , to reproduce the short- and long - time behavior of the propagator , as well as its tail behavior .",

    "the regularized model also allows us to obtain analytical results about the instanton or optimal path of the system , which is the most probable path singled out by the weak - noise approximation , and the so - called action functional or quasipotential , obtained by approximating the propagator at the lowest order in @xmath4 with the optimal path @xcite . from these results , presented in sec .",
