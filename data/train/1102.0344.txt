    "a space curve is determined by the arc - length , curvature , and torsion up to motions of @xmath0 . in a mbius geometric framework , it was shown by fialkow ( @xcite ) that a space curve is determined by three conformal invariants , conformal arc - length , conformal curvature , and conformal torsion , up to mbius transformations .",
    "the conformal arc - length was found by liebmann @xcite for space curves and by pick for plane curves .",
    "the conformal curvature and torsion were given by vessiot @xcite .",
    "they have been studied by fialkow using conformal derivations @xcite , by sulanke using cartan s group theoretical method of moving frames @xcite , and by cairns , sharpe , and webb using normal forms @xcite .",
    "conformal torsion was also studied in @xcite using conformal invariants for pairs of spheres .    in @xcite the first and the second authors showed that the conformal arc - length can be considered as `` @xmath1-dimensional measure '' of the curve of osculating circles .",
    "this paper is a natural continuation of it .",
    "we use both curves @xmath2 of osculating circles and @xmath3 of osculating spheres , which belong to different spaces , and by doing so we give ( hopefully ) new formula for the conformal curvature ( theorem [ characterization_q_2 ] ) .",
    "we also give moving frames in the minkowski space using @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "then the conformal curvature and conformal torsion appear in frenet matrix ( this is a just of translation of sulanke s result @xcite to our context ) . by taking the projection to the euclidean space which can be realized in @xmath4 as an affine section of the light cone",
    ", we obtain the normal form given in @xcite .",
    "we give a proof of formulae of conformal curvature and torsion in @xcite using our theorem [ characterization_q_2 ] .",
    "thus , we get geometric and simpler description of integration of preceding studies of conformal invariants of space ( and planar ) curves .",
    "we also study canal surfaces and give the characterization of them as curves in the set of circles in @xmath5 .",
    "the authors thank gil solanes for many useful discussions .",
    "let us start with basics in mbius geometry which are needed for the study of curves of osculating circles and of osculating spheres .",
    "we start by recalling a commonly used models of a sphere and the euclidean space in mbius geometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . let us explain in a @xmath7-dimensional case .",
    "the _ minkowski space _",
    "@xmath4 is @xmath8 endowed with an indefinite inner product ( the _ minkowski product _ or the _ lorentz form _ ) given by @xmath9 the _ light cone _",
    "@xmath10 is given by @xmath11 .",
    "a vector subspace @xmath12 of @xmath4 is said to be _ time - like _ if it contains a non - zero time - like vector . when @xmath13 , @xmath14 is time - like if and only if it intersects the light cone transversally .",
    "a @xmath7-sphere @xmath15 or @xmath16 can be identified with the projectivization of the light cone .",
    "in fact , they can be _ isometrically _ embedded in @xmath4 as the intersection of the light cone and a codimension @xmath17 affine subspace @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath19 for some unit time - like vector @xmath20 , in which case @xmath18 is tangent to the hyperboloid @xmath21 at point @xmath20 , @xmath22 is a unit sphere . when @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath19 for some light - like vector @xmath20 , in which case @xmath18 is parallel to a codimension @xmath17 subspace which is tangent to the light cone in @xmath23 , @xmath22 is a paraboloid @xmath24 .",
    "the metric induced from the lorentz quadratic form on @xmath24 is euclidean .",
    "for example , when @xmath25 , the euclidean space can be isometrically embedded as @xmath26 we use the notation @xmath5 and @xmath24 to emphasize that they are embedded in @xmath4 .",
    "an oriented sphere @xmath28 in @xmath5 can be obtained as the intersection of an oriented time - like @xmath29-dimensional subspace of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the set @xmath30 of oriented spheres in @xmath5 can be identified with the grassmann manifold @xmath31 of oriented time - like @xmath29 dimensional subspaces of @xmath4 . by taking the orthogonal complement",
    ", we obtain a bijection between @xmath31 and the set of oriented space - like lines , which can be identified with the quadric @xmath32 called _ de sitter space _ ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the bijection from @xmath33 to @xmath30 is given by @xmath34 oriented as the boundary of the ball @xmath35 , and its inverse is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the _ lorentz vector product _ with respect to @xmath38 that is characterized by @xmath39 , the norm @xmath40 being equal to the volume of parallelepiped spanned by @xmath41 which is given by @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( @xcite ) .",
    "then @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "direct computation shows @xmath48 @xmath49    -spheres .",
    "[ fig1],width=264 ]    similarly , the set of oriented circles in @xmath50 can be identified with de sitter space @xmath51 in @xmath52 .",
    "in general , the set of oriented @xmath53-dimensional subspheres in @xmath54 can be identified with the grassmann manifold @xmath55 of oriented time - like @xmath56-dimensional subspaces in @xmath57 . by taking the orthogonal complement",
    "we obtain a bijection from @xmath55 to the grassmann manifold @xmath58 of oriented space - like @xmath59-dimensional subspaces in @xmath57 .",
    "thus we need the pseudo - riemannian structure of these grassmannians .",
    "the canonical extension of positive definite inner product to grassmann algebras is given by @xmath60 but in our case , as we start with the minkowski space , it does not fit .",
    "therefore we agree ( after @xcite page 280 ) that the pseudo - riemannian structures on our grassmannians are given by @xmath61 \\displaystyle \\phantom{-}\\det\\big(\\langle u^i , v^j\\rangle\\big ) & \\>\\>\\mbox{if $ \\mbox{span}(u^i)$ and $ \\mbox{span}(v^i)$ are space - like}. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]      an oriented circle @xmath62 in @xmath5 can be obtained as the intersection of an oriented time - like @xmath7-dimensional subspace of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the set @xmath63 of oriented circles in @xmath5 can be identified with the grassmann manifold @xmath64 of oriented time - like @xmath7 dimensional subspaces of @xmath4 . by taking the orthogonal complement",
    ", we obtain the bijection between @xmath64 and the grassmann manifold @xmath65 of oriented space - like @xmath66 dimensional subspaces of @xmath4 .",
    "recall that the wedge product @xmath67 of two vectors in @xmath4 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , is given by @xmath70 , where the plcker coordinates @xmath71 are given by @xmath72 and a vectore @xmath73 in @xmath74 is a pure @xmath66-vector , i.e. the wedge product of two vectors in @xmath4 if and only if @xmath71 satisfy the plcker relation : @xmath75 we remark that all of them are not independent .",
    "for example , the relations ( [ plucker_relation_4 ] ) and ( [ plucker_relation_5 ] ) can be derived from the rest if @xmath76 .",
    "then @xmath65 can be identified with the set of unit space - like pure @xmath66-vectors : @xmath77 now the identification between @xmath63 and @xmath65 can be explicitly given by @xmath78      let @xmath79 be a point in a curve @xmath80 in @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the arc - length parameter .",

    "let @xmath84 be a time - like vector subspace of @xmath4 of dimension @xmath7 ( or @xmath29 ) .",
    "then the curve @xmath80 has contact of order @xmath85 with the circle ( or the sphere respectively ) @xmath86 if and only if @xmath87 belong to @xmath84 ( remark that the curve is not in @xmath0 but in @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , an osculating circle to @xmath80 at @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 , and an osculating sphere is generically given by @xmath90 .    in what follows",

    "there are one or two natural conformally invariant parameters : one is the conformal arc - length which will be denoted by @xmath111 , and the other is the arc - length parameter of the curve of osculating spheres which will be denoted by @xmath104 .",
    "the latter appears only when @xmath80 is a space curve .",
