    "in this talk , i m going to present a summary of recent developments in photoproduction at hera . by `` photoproduction ''",
    "i mean @xmath0 interactions in which the photon is close to being on its mass shell .",
    "furthermore , i shall focus on processes in which there exists at least one hard scale  so that we have the chance to use perturbation theory .",
    "i m going to divide the talk into 4 parts : jets ( single & dijet rates ) ; jet profiles ; open charm production ( @xmath1 s ) ; inelastic charmonium production .",
    "i wo nt talk about processes with rapidity gaps , since these diffractive processes are covered in other people s presentations .",
    "i wish to start by recalling some basic terminology .",
    "it is convenient to talk about two classes of photoproduction event : those in which all of the energy of the incoming photon is delivered to the hard subprocess ( these are called `` direct '' processes ) and those in which only part of the incoming photon energy goes into producing the hard subprocess ( these are called `` resolved '' processes ) .",
    "fig.[fig1](a ) shows the lowest order contribution from these two types of process in the case of jet production .",
    "the dotted lines show where we chose to separate the hard process from the non - perturbative parton distribution functions .",
    "the factorization scales @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in principle arbitrary but a good choice would be to pick them to be @xmath4 ( i.e. the jet transverse momentum ) since this choice will account for the fact that the incoming partons have a large region of transverse phase space into which they can radiate other partons . nonetheless , it is certainly true that the theoretical calculation will exhibit a strong sensitivity to any variation in the factorization scales since the @xmath5 hard subprocesses contain no dependence upon the factorization scales whereas the parton distribution functions do .",
    "for example , we could effectively turn off all parton evolution by picking the factorization scales to be much smaller than @xmath6 . at this level of calculation ,",
    "it is clear what we mean by `` direct '' and `` resolved '' processes .    in fig.[fig1](b ) , the @xmath7 corrections to the jet production process are shown .",
    "we have to account for the fact that the hard subprocess can radiate off 3 partons into the final state as well as the virtual corrections to the 2 parton final state .",
    "again , we can classify diagrams as being direct or resolved . however , there are collinear divergences associated with the 3 parton final state .",
    "this means that the 3 parton hard subprocesses are dependent upon the factorization scales .",
    "let us focus on the @xmath2 dependence . by varying @xmath2",
    "we vary the amount of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath8 processes that should really be attributed to the lowest order ( lo ) resolved process . in particular , the amount of nlo direct that should rightfully be factorized into the lo resolved contribution depends upon the choice of @xmath2 . in this way",
    ", the strong dependence upon the factorization scales is reduced by including the nlo contribution .",
    "also , we can no longer uniquely define the separation of direct and resolved processes .",
    "nlo calculations of the single jet inclusive rate have been available for a while now @xcite .",
    "comparison with the data @xcite should tell us about the parton content of the photon , and in particular its gluonic content ( which is not really constrained from elsewhere ) .",
    "however , in just the region where one expects sensitivity to the gluon in the photon the nlo theory is not working ! forward jets ( i.e. those heading largely in the proton direction and hence having positive pseudo - rapidity , @xmath9 ) with modest values of transverse energy , @xmath10 , are most sensitive to the gluon content of the photon .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] compares the 1993 zeus data with the theoretical calculations of klasen , kramer & salesch @xcite which use the gs(ho ) photon parton densities @xcite and the mrsd- proton densities @xcite .",
    "comparison reveals that the theory is well below the data for forward jets at the lower @xmath10 values ( this conclusion is also supported by the h1 data and the zeus 1994 data ) .",
    "the problem seems not so bad as @xmath10 is increased .",
    "one might argue that the difference between theory and data should be attributed to the fact that the photon parton density functions need adjusting , i.e. more gluons are required at low @xmath11 .",
    "however , one should be cautious .",
    "these forward jets are also much broader than expected from monte carlo studies .",
    "it is possible that the broadening of the forward jets comes about in the presence of a large underlying event .",
    "models which attempt to account for some or all of this physics @xcite have received some support from the data @xcite . in particular , simple models of multiple parton scattering produce large effects in the forward region , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "multiple parton scattering is anticipated on the grounds that forward jets at low @xmath10 are produced as a result of interactions between slow partons in the colliding particles .",
    "we know that qcd predicts a proliferation of these slow partons , and as such it may well be that more than one pair of them can interact in each @xmath0 interaction .    in summary , the hera experiments are providing precise data which is ready for comparison with the theory .",
    "however , before we can safely extract the photon parton distribution functions we really need to understand what is going on with the forward jets .",
    "i think the issue of the forward jets is potentially very interesting .",
    "if multiple interactions really are present , then we are looking at a new regime of qcd .",
    "data on two or more jets @xcite provides us with further options to test qcd and understand the nature of the `` strongly interacting '' photon .",
    "in particular , the two highest @xmath10 jets can be used to compute the variable @xmath12 at lowest order , @xmath13 for direct events and @xmath14 for resolved events .",
    "a cut on @xmath15 therefore provides a physical definition of direct and resolved event classes .",
    "zeus has defined direct enriched and resolved enriched samples by separating events according to a cut at @xmath16 .",
    "the direct enriched sample is very sensitive to the small-@xmath11 gluon content of the proton : the more backward the dijets , the lower the @xmath11 values in the proton that are probed .",
    "conversely , the resolved enriched sample is sensitive to the gluon content in the photon .",
    "in addition , nlo calculations for the dijet rates are now available for comparison with the data @xcite .",
    "let s summarize the situation as it stands right now .    for @xmath17 , as can be seen from fig.[fig3 ]",
    ", the nlo theory does a good job . however",
    "( and this is not shown in the plot ) there remains quite a large contamination from the large-@xmath11 part of the photon quark distribution functions .",
    "this arises because of the harder form of the photon quark densities .",
    "to unravel the effects of the low-@xmath11 gluons in the proton from the large-@xmath11 quarks in the photon requires a tighter cut on @xmath15 .",
    "this is feasible , for example for @xmath18 gev and 250pb@xmath19 of @xmath20 data one expects around 4500 events with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "also , comparison between data and theory requires that the same jet algorithm is used . to facilitate a clean comparison between data and theory ,",
    "the zeus collaboration has started to used the @xmath22-cluster algorithm @xcite .    for @xmath23 fig.[fig3 ] reveals that the theory falls well below the data for the lowest @xmath10 forward dijets .",
    "the effect exhibits a strong dependence upon the @xmath10 cut , which suggests that it can not be explained by modifying the parton distribution functions of the photon in any sensible way .",
    "presumably , this is the same problem as that which we encounter for the single jets .",
    "again , multiple interactions help fix the problem .",
    "the dijet measurements shown in fig.[fig3 ] have been made with a cut on the minimum @xmath10 of the jets and the cut is the same for both jets .",
    "this introduces a further theoretical problem .",
    "this arises because most of the jets will be produced around the minimum allowable @xmath10 , i.e. the typical difference between the jet transverse momenta , @xmath24 , will be small .",
    "so , the 3 parton final state ( which is present in the nlo calculation ) must have one of the partons either collinear with another , or very soft .",
    "the collinear configuration is easy to deal with ( it is factorized ) but the soft parton emission leads to a @xmath25 contribution .",
    "this large logarithm signals that multiple soft parton emission is important .",
    "these soft parton effects can be studied by looking explicitly at the @xmath24 distribution of the dijets or they can be avoided by making a cut which keeps away from @xmath26 .",
    "complementary to the jet rapidity and @xmath10 distributions is the distribution in the polar angle of the jets , as defined in the dijet centre - of - mass frame .",
    "such a measurement is insensitive to the parton density functions but sensitive to the subprocess which drives the jet production .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows the data @xcite and the good agreement with nlo theory @xcite .",
    "the steepening of the @xmath27 distribution as @xmath28 is greater in the resolved enriched sample than in the direct enriched sample due simply to the fact that the resolved process proceeds predominantly through @xmath29-channel gluon exchange whilst the direct processes go via @xmath29-channel quark exchange .    in conclusion ,",
    "the dijets provide information which complements the single jet measurements .",
    "the data is now reaching a high level of precision , and comparison with nlo theory has revealed a number of pressing issues . in particular , we need to understand better the forward jets , ensure that we are using the most convenient jet algorithm , and be aware of any sensitivity from soft parton emission .",
    "once these issues have been addressed , we can expect to gain further insight into the gluon content of both the photon and proton .",
    "now i want to address the question : `` what is a jet ? '' . an observable which has been used to investigate",
    "this question is the shape variable @xmath30 which is the fraction of the jet ( of cone size @xmath31 ) energy lying within a cone of size @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the lowest non - trivial order for this quantity involves the 3 parton matrix elements .",
    "to compute to order @xmath33 requires the 4 parton final state matrix elements @xcite .",
    "klasen & kramer have been able to fit the zeus data on jet shapes @xcite but only after introducing the parameter , @xmath34 , into their calculations @xcite .",
    "let s take a closer look at the @xmath34 parameter .",
    "it s a good idea to first remind ourselves of the steps involved in building jets using a cone algorithm @xcite .",
    "the zeus jets are found using an iterative cone algorithm ( pucell ) .",
    "this algorithm defines some threshold energy , @xmath35 , and calorimeter cells above this energy define the seeds for the jet finding . a jet is formed by summing all cells within a distance @xmath31 ( in @xmath36 space ) of the seed cell . if , after this , the jet axis no longer coincides with that of the original seed cell then the new jet axis is used and all cells within @xmath31 of it are used to redefine the jet .",
    "this process is iterated until a stable jet direction is achieved .",
    "it is possible that some of the jets overlap and so some criterion needs to be established to decide what should be done with these jets . for example , if one of the overlapping jets has more than 75% of its energy in common with another jet then one could merge the two jets , whilst if the overlap energy is less then one could split the two jets by assigning particles to the jet to which they are nearest . finally , jets are accepted if their @xmath10 is larger than some minimum value . in the theoretical case ,",
    "two partons are combined if they lie within a distance @xmath37 of each other , where @xmath38.\\ ] ] we have introduced @xmath34 into this definition , it is introduced so as to simulate the effect of seed finding .",
    "for example , two partons with equal @xmath10 s lying a distance @xmath39 apart could be considered to form a single jet ( the partons lying on the edge of the jet cone ) .",
    "such a configuration could not occur in the experimental algorithm , since there is no seed cell in between the two partons . as a result ,",
    "for a 3 ( or less ) parton final state , picking @xmath40 should match the theoretical and experimental definition of the jets .",
    "notice that the 3 parton final state does not call for any jet merging . by fitting @xmath34 to the data ,",
    "one is accounting for higher order effects by fitting a single parameter ( to fit the data klasen & kramer need to vary @xmath34 from 1.3 to 1.8 for jets with @xmath41 to @xmath42 respectively ) .",
    "for example , parton shower and hadronization effects ( plus , maybe , multiple parton scattering ) all effect the final state and we do not really learn much about them by tuning the theoretical calculation .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] demonstrates that forward jets are broader , as i claimed earlier .",
    "it also shows how multiple parton interactions can help improve the situation .",
    "it really is a challenge to theorists to explain the variation of @xmath34 .",
    "steps in this direction require a truly nlo calculation of the jet shape variable .",
    "as mentioned above , this means we need to consider the 4 parton final state . at this point , we realise that the iterative cone algorithm is not infra - red safe . by this",
    "we mean that it is not insensitive to the addition of a soft parton @xcite . to see this consider the 4 parton final state illustrated in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the middle of the upper 3 arrows denotes a soft parton , which has energy just above the threshold energy , @xmath35 .",
    "the presence of this seed in between the two hard partons would cause all 3 partons to be merged into a single jet .",
    "so our shape variable is sensitive to the cell threshold energy .",
    "this is an acute problem at any fixed order in perturbation theory ( beyond lo ) .",
    "however , a strong @xmath35 dependence is nt seen in monte carlo studies .",
    "let me outline the basic idea as to why this should be so @xcite .",
    "denote the probability for emitting a single parton into the overlap region , @xmath43 , where    @xmath44    this probability exponentiates on summing over all possible numbers of soft partons , i.e. @xmath45 so as @xmath46 a soft parton is guaranteed to be in the overlap region , i.e. @xmath47 . thus we see that , on expanding the exponential , any finite order in @xmath48 is sensitive to large @xmath49 terms but that this sensitivity goes away on summing to all orders ( as is done in the parton shower routines ) . as pointed out by steve ellis @xcite this problem can be fixed simply be redefining the jet algorithm , so that the mid - point between jets is always treated as a seed , regardless of any activity . alternatively , the @xmath22 cluster algorithm avoids such problems .",
    "i think it is fair to say that studies on jet structure are reaching the point where theory really is starting to address the important issues .",
    "we should learn much over the coming few years .",
    "the photoproduction of charm quarks at large @xmath6 is a process which involves two large scales , @xmath50 and as such , makes life more complicated from the theoretical point of view .",
    "good data , which can be expected in the future ( especially if the charm can be tagged using a microvertex detector ) , will surely shed light on this intriguing area . at present , there are two main routes used in theoretical calculations .",
    "i ll start by describing briefly each .",
    "* massive charm : * the charm quark mass is considered to provide the hard scale , as such charm only ever appears in the hard subprocess and there is no notion of radiatively generated charm in the sense of parton evolution @xcite .",
    "this means that terms @xmath51 are not summed to all orders ( in the parton distribution and fragmentation functions ) . as such",
    ", we might expect this approach to become less accurate when @xmath52 .",
    "however , it does provide a systematic way of accounting for charm quark mass effects , which will be important for @xmath53 .",
    "* massless charm : * in this approach , the charm quark is treated as massless ( above threshold ) , and as such is treated like any other light quark in the parton evolution equations and hard subprocess cross - sections .",
    "the @xmath54 terms are now summed to all orders , but charm quark mass effects are ignored .",
    "so , this approach should get better as @xmath55 increases .    at present",
    "the data @xcite lies in the intermediate region where @xmath56 gev , i.e. it is not clear which , if any , of the two approaches should be used . in order to compute the inclusive @xmath1 rate",
    ", one needs the appropriate fragmentation function .",
    "either the peterson @xcite form or the @xmath57 form do a good job , and have been well constrained by @xmath58 data .",
    "initial comparison between theory and data suggested that the massive charm calculation was too low , e.g see @xcite .",
    "more recently , the situation has changed somewhat @xcite .",
    "the full nlo calculations require that the fragmentation function be consistently extracted from the @xmath58 data .",
    "when this is done , cacciari and greco find that the theoretical predictions are increased significantly relative to what is found using the softer ( lo ) fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "this is true for both massless and massive charm calculations and , within theoretical uncertainties , both are now consistent with the present data .",
    "for example , fig.[fig7 ] is a plot from @xcite , which shows that the nlo theory assuming massless charm agrees well with the data .    more data at large @xmath6 and increased statistics at intermediate @xmath6",
    "will certainly help in our study of the interplay of @xmath59 and @xmath60 effects .",
    "in addition , for @xmath61 we have the possibility to study the `` intrinsic '' charm within the photon ( charm in dijets offers good prospects here ) .",
    "originally , inelastic photoproduction of charmonium , e.g. @xmath62 , was advertised as an ideal way to extract the gluon density in the proton ( since it is driven by photon - gluon fusion into a @xmath63 pair ) . more recently ,",
    "nlo calculations have put a dampener on this goal ( as we shall see shortly ) .",
    "however , there has been a great deal of recent interest in the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) approach to heavy quarkonium production , and the inelastic photoproduction of heavy quarkonia provides the ideal opportunity to test nrqcd .",
    "bodwin , braaten and lepage derived a factorization formula which describes the inclusive production ( and decay ) of a heavy quarkonium state @xcite . in the case of photoproduction , fig.[fig8 ]",
    "shows the lowest order contribution .",
    "the nrqcd factorization formula for the corresponding cross - section reads @xmath64+x ) \\langle o^h_n \\rangle.\\ ] ] @xmath65 denotes that the process is inclusive , @xmath66+x)$ ] is the perturbatively calculable cross - section for @xmath67 and it can be written as a series expansion in @xmath68 . the @xmath69 pair is produced with quantum numbers @xmath70 .",
    "the matrix element , @xmath71 , contains the long distance physics associated with the formation of the quarkonium state @xmath72 from the @xmath69 state  it is essentially the probability that the pointlike @xmath69 pair forms @xmath72 inclusively . the typical scale associated with this part of the process is @xmath73 which is much smaller than @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is the relative velocity of the @xmath69 pair , and is small for heavy enough quarks ) .",
    "this hierarchy of scales underlies the nrqcd factorization .",
    "note that the @xmath69 state is not restricted to having the same quantum numbers as the meson .",
    "fortunately , there exist `` velocity scaling rules '' which allow us to identify which states , @xmath70 , are the most important .",
    "more precisely , the `` velocity scaling rules '' order the operators @xmath76 according to how many powers of @xmath75 they contain , i.e. relativistic corrections can be computed systematically .",
    "the nrqcd approach therefore provides us with a systematic way of computing inclusive heavy quarkonium production ( modulo corrections which are suppressed by powers of @xmath77 ) .",
    "the strategy is first to organise the sum over @xmath70 into an expansion in @xmath75 and then to systematically compute @xmath78 order - by - order in @xmath68 .",
    "technically , we do not a priori know where our efforts are best placed , i.e. do we work at lowest order in @xmath75 and to nlo in @xmath48 or do we attempt to work at higher orders in @xmath75 , but computing each hard subprocess to lowest order ?",
    "we need to know @xmath75 in order to judge better what to do .    one final word before moving on to discuss @xmath62 photoproduction . for small @xmath6 ,",
    "nrqcd factorization is likely to break down , due to contamination from higher twist effects .",
    "also , one expects breakdown of the nrqcd approach in the vicinity of the elastic scattering region , i.e. @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the fraction of the photon energy carried by the quarkonium ( see later ) .",
    "inelastic photoproduction of @xmath62 is something which has already been measured at hera .",
    "let s see how the theory shapes up . to lowest order in the velocity expansion , @xmath81 = [ 1,^3 \\ !",
    "the first entry in the square brackets tells us that the @xmath82 is in a colour singlet state , whilst the second entry tells us the spin and angular momentum of the state . not surprisingly , to lowest order in the velocity expansion , the @xmath83 must be produced with the same quantum numbers as the @xmath62 .",
    "this is just the colour singlet model ( csm ) of old .",
    "the lowest order diagram which can contribute is shown in fig.[fig8 ] and @xmath84 \\rangle \\sim | \\phi(0 ) |^2\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the wavefunction at the origin ( it can be extracted from the electronic width of the @xmath62 ) .",
    "nlo@xmath86 corrections have been computed @xcite and shown to be large .",
    "fig.[fig9 ] shows that the nlo corrections enhance the lo calculation and lead to a reduced sensitivity to the gluon density in the proton .",
    "one might well ask as to the significance of the resolved photon contribution . it is important at small enough @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "in addition , for mesons produced at high enough @xmath6 we have an additional scale to consider and terms which are leading in @xmath48 can be suppressed by powers of @xmath87 .",
    "this is true for example of the diagram shown in fig.[fig8 ] relative to that shown in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "the latter fragmentation contribution is higher order in @xmath48 , however there is one less hard quark propagator and so it will dominate for large enough @xmath6 .",
    "fragmentation contributions and resolved photon contributions are not important in computing the total rate for @xmath88 ( which is essentially where the data is ) , and so we expect the curves in fig.[fig8 ] to be reliable .",
    "going to nlo in the velocity expansion means moving away from the csm .",
    "for the first time we encounter colour octet contributions .",
    "in particular , the lo@xmath86 diagram is again that of fig.[fig8 ] which lies outside our region of interest .",
    "] now the @xmath83 can be formed in one of 5 states , i.e. @xmath81 = [ 8,^1 \\ !",
    "s_0 ] , [ 8,^3 \\ ! s_1 ] , [ 8,^3 \\ ! p_{0,1,2}]$ ] .",
    "the price one pays for having to convert this state into the @xmath62 is an extra power of @xmath89 relative to the colour singlet matrix element , i.e. @xmath90 \\rangle   \\sim v^4 \\langle o^{j/\\psi}[1,^3 \\ !",
    "s_1 ] \\rangle.\\ ] ] it turns out that the @xmath91 suppression of the long distance matrix elements is partially compensated for by a strong enhancement of the corresponding short distance cross - section .",
    "in particular , this is so for the @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] states .",
    "the colour singlet matrix element can be extracted from data , e.g. the leptonic width of the @xmath62 .",
    "likewise , we need to fit these new matrix elements to data ( or extract them from lattice calculations ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that a test of the nrqd framework requires data from different sources  the challenge being to find a consistent description .",
    "this is a particularly topical issue , since an explanation of the tevatron excess of direct @xmath62 and @xmath94 production needs , in addition to fragmentation contributions , colour octet contributions @xcite .",
    "one can use the tevatron data to fit the relevant matrix elements .",
    "the validity of this explanation can be confirmed ( or not ) on comparing to data which can be obtained from hera .",
    "unfortunately , the matrix elements which are important at the tevatron are not so important in @xmath62 photoproduction for @xmath88",
    ". however , the key matrix element for the tevatron ( @xmath95 $ ] ) does play a key role in the region of lower @xmath80 , where ( large enough @xmath6 ) the dominant contribution comes from the fragmentation mechanism via resolved photons @xcite .",
    "another process which is sensitive to the @xmath95 $ ] state is the photoproduction of @xmath96 ( where the photon is produced in the hard subprocess , i.e. not via the radiative decay of a @xmath97-wave quarkonium ) @xcite .",
    "so , with the anticipated increase in statistics , we can really expect to test nrqcd at hera .",
    "going back to the @xmath62 , there are some weak constraints on the important matrix elements from the tevatron data and these have been used in the theoretical calculations of @xcite . in fig.[fig11 ] the hera data on the @xmath80 distribution are shown and seen to compare very well with the colour singlet calculation .",
    "the colour octet contribution however , is much too large at large @xmath80 .",
    "the shaded band on the theory prediction denotes the type of uncertainty expected from the fit to the matrix elements , although this error is hard to ascertain with confidence .",
    "thus the hera data is not supporting a large colour octet contribution at large @xmath80 .",
    "however , one must be careful in interpreting this as evidence against the nrqcd approach , since the @xmath79 region is sensitive to higher order non - perturbative contributions which lead to the breakdown of the nrqcd expansion @xcite .",
    "in addition to the processes just discussed , increased statistics will allow measurement of other meson states , e.g. @xmath94 and @xmath98 which will certainly further test our understanding of qcd .    before finishing",
    ", i d like to mention an alternative to the nrqcd approach which is the colour evaporation model , e.g. see @xcite ( essentially a resurrection of the old duality calculations @xcite ) .",
    "the production rate is calculated according to @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the invariant mass of the produced @xmath83 pair .",
    "this is the cross - section for production of charmonium , i.e. it is the sum of production rates for @xmath101 and @xmath102 . to get the rate for any particular state",
    ", one must multiply by some ( empirically determined ) factor .",
    "the factor of @xmath103 comes from arguing that the colour octet @xmath83 convert with probability 1/9 into a singlet state ( which must be charmonium in this mass range ) .",
    "the colour bleaching is supposed to occur as a result of some soft final state interactions , the precise nature of which is not important . for more details on the phenomenological success of the colour evaporation approach ,",
    "i refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "the future bodes well , not least as a consequence of the anticipated increase in statistics .",
    "higher statistics will mean more precise studies of open charm production over a wide kinematic range ( which is vital if we are to develop our understanding ) and will also allow us to really test our understanding of charmonium production and , in particular , nrqcd .",
    "the intriguing issue of forward jet production needs further work before we can claim to really understand what is happening .",
    "nlo theory facilitates more precise tests of single and dijet rates using what is becoming very good data ",
    "it is true to say that we are learning how to really test the theory .",
    "i did nt mention the structure of the virtual photon or prompt photon production .",
    "good data is starting to accumulate on both these processes and we can anticipate that much will be learnt over the next few years .",
