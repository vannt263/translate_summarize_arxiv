    "there are two common points in the above two experiments : ( i ) the macroscopic work in the expansion process is vanishing ( i.e. @xmath9 ) ; ( ii ) after the systems arriving at the final equilibrium states , the free energy difference is @xmath10 .",

    "jarzynski and crooks argued that the je fails because the initial distribution function is not canonical in the second case @xcite .",
    "we would like to consider this problem from another point of view : the initial distribution function is still canonical but a more underlying reason makes the je fail . in other words , there is a more general form of je . the rest of this paper is focus on this topic and organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] , we give further discussions and a brief summary .",
    "an important relation between the ft and je is that the je can be derived from the ft for time reversible stochastic or deterministic dynamics @xcite . here",

    "( [ crucialeq ] ) , the time integral of the phase space contraction factor exactly expressed as the entropy production resulting from the heat absorbed by the system from the thermal bath , is the crucial point in the derivation of the je from the ft .",

    "now , we check whether the condition of adiabatic incompressibility holds for the systems mentioned in the above two experiments .    for the first experiment , because the initial velocity distribution obeys the maxwell distribution , some particles with velocity larger than @xmath5 will strike the piston and then bounce fully but @xmath5 is unchanged because the mass of the piston is much larger than the total mass of the particles that collide with it . in each bounces , the piston will do a small work on the gas system .",

    "for the second experiment , the volume expansion has no direct effect on the momentum of the particles .",

    "noticing that the mass of the piston in the first experiment is infinitely large .",
    "if it has an infinitesimal value , this system is equivalent to that in the second experiment because the collisions between particles and the piston has no effect on the momentum of the particles such that the particles do not feel the existence of the piston .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the intermediate case between the above two limits .",

    "\\(i ) if the volume of the thermal system is fixed but other parameter varies such as in the single molecule mechanical experiments @xcite , je always holds because the effective dynamics can be expressed as eqs.([dyn1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ dyn1 - 2 ] ) . generally speaking , one may not construct a parameter - dependent hamiltonian and express the effective dynamics as eqs.([dyn1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ dyn1 - 2 ] ) if the volume changes .",
    "je may be violated in this case .",
    "however , je still holds if one can control the ratio of volume change because the the particles fully bounce when they collide with the piston in this case , i.e. , controlling the ratio is equivalent to @xmath112 .",
    "\\(ii ) the derivation of je from ft does not require the thermostat for the whole process from @xmath2 to @xmath6 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the system is at an equilibrium state in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the external field is switched on from time @xmath2 to @xmath60 .",
    "the contact with a thermal bath is unnecessary in this stage ( i.e. no heat exchange , @xmath113 ) .",
    "after that , the external field is fixed and let the system contact with the same thermal bath . at time @xmath6 , the system reaches the equilibrium state through a long time relaxation .",
    "the thermostat is merely required in this stage ( from @xmath60 to @xmath6 ) . in fact , this requirement is the same as the original proof of je @xcite , which ensures us to calculate @xmath114 easily from numerical simulations .",
    "\\(iii ) equations ( [ dyn2 - 1])([dyn2 - 3 ] ) , ( [ dyn3 - 2 ] ) , and ( [ dyn4 - 2 ] ) are the _ effective _ dynamics of thermal system with the volume changes . here",
    "the `` effective '' means that the dynamics is not the real microscopic motion ( of course , the real motion for each particle still abides by newtonian laws ) , while it is the image mapping from the real motion and can give the correct thermodynamic properties of the system through molecule dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the effective term @xmath63 in these equations reflects the collisions between the piston and particles .",
    "if the particle fully bounces ( i.e. @xmath115 ) , the coefficient before this term is @xmath116 .",
    "if the particle do not bounce ( i.e. @xmath117 ) , the coefficient is @xmath118 . for finite @xmath78",

    "we use @xmath80 to express this coefficient in eq.([dyn4 - 2 ] ) . in the second experiment , @xmath119 for @xmath22 , but @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "thus @xmath59 is a @xmath122-function , which implies @xmath123 changes discontinuously .",

( [ genje1 ] ) holds for @xmath117 . that is , the numerical results obtained from the real dynamics are the same as those derived from the effective dynamics eqs .",
    "( [ dyn2 - 1])([dyn2 - 3 ] ) and ( [ dyn3 - 2 ] ) , which suggests that the effective dynamics is consistent with the real dynamics and our argument that the term @xmath63 reflects the collisions between the piston and particles is reasonable .    in summary , we have pointed out that the crucial point in the derivation of the je from the ft is that the time integral of the phase space contraction factor is exactly expressed as the entropy production resulting from the heat absorbed by the system from the thermal bath , i.e. the dynamics of the system satisfies the condition of adiabatic incompressibility . for the system violating this condition , a more general version of je , eq .",
