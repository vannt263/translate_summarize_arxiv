    "in recent years the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations have indicated a possibly late time _",
    "accelerated expansion _ of the universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this discovery has been supported also by indirect observations of the expansion of the universe like the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite observations .",
    "it has been coined the name _ dark energy _ to refer to the unknown responsible of such acceleration that presumably is the @xmath8 of the total content of matter and energy in the universe @xcite-@xcite .    since the time of this discovery in 1998 @xcite , a large amount of models",
    "have been proposed to explain this acceleration .",
    "the two most accepted dark energy models are that of a _ cosmological constant _ ( assumed possibly to be the quantum vacuum energy ) and a slowly varying rolling scalar field ( quintessence models ) @xcite-@xcite .    despite the cosmological constant model is preferred by the observations , this has several strong problems , among them ,",
    "the huge discrepancy between its predicted and observed value ( a difference of about 120 orders of magnitude ) @xcite-@xcite and the problem of that we are living _ precisely _ in a time when the matter density in the universe is of the same order than the dark energy density ( the `` _ _ cosmic coincidence problem _ _ '' ) @xcite , @xcite .    on the other hand , in the context of _ inflation _ of the very early universe , it has been known since long time ago that an imperfect fluid with bulk viscosity in cosmology can produce an acceleration in the expansion of the universe without the need of a cosmological constant or some inflationary scalar field @xcite@xcite ( although some authors do not agree with this conclusion @xcite ) .",
    "so , extrapolating this theoretical idea used to induce an accelerating universe without the need of unknown components it is possible to postulate that one candidate to explain the present acceleration can be a bulk viscous pressure @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , this idea faces some problems too , for example , the need to have a satisfactory mechanism for the origin and composition of the bulk viscosity , nevertheless , there are already some authors working in this aspect @xcite-@xcite .    from a thermodynamical point of view",
    "the bulk viscosity in a physical system is due to its deviations from the _ local _ thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite ( for a review in the theory of relativistic dissipative fluids see @xcite ) . in a cosmological fluid",
    ", the bulk viscosity may arise when the fluid expands ( or contracts ) too fast so that the system does not have enough time to restore its local thermodynamic equilibrium and then it arises an _ effective pressure _ restoring the system to its thermal equilibrium . the bulk viscosity can be seen as a measurement of this effective pressure . when the fluid reaches again the thermal equilibrium then the bulk viscous pressure vanishes @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "so , in an _ accelerated _ expanding universe , it may be natural to assume the possibility that the expansion process is actually a collection of states out of thermal equilibrium in a small fraction of time giving rise to the existence of a bulk viscosity .    in the present work we study and test a matter - dominated cosmological model with bulk viscosity as an explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the model is composed by a pressureless fluid ( dust ) with bulk viscosity of the form @xmath9 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants to be determined by the observations and @xmath3 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the pressureless fluid characterizes both the baryon and dark matter components .",
    "the term `` @xmath1 '' takes into account the simplest parametrization for the bulk viscosity , a constant . and",
    "the term `` @xmath10 '' characterizes the possibility of a bulk viscosity proportional to the expansion ratio of the universe .",
    "the idea of this model is to drive the present acceleration using the trigger at recent times of the bulk viscous pressure of the dust fluid instead of any dark energy component .",
    "this fluid represents an unified description of the dark sector plus the baryon component in a similar way than the chaplygin gas model ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the advantages of the model is that it solves automatically the cosmic coincidence problem because there is not any dark energy component .",
    "the explicit form of the bulk viscosity has to be assumed a priori or obtained from a known or proposed physical mechanism . in the present work",
    "we choose the first option to explore the possibilities , but with the idea to explore the second option in future works .",
    "different aspects of this model has been also studied in @xcite and references therein .",
    "there is already a large amount of works on viscous fluids in cosmology with different parametrizations and motivations .",
    "for instance , the particular case of a constant bulk viscosity ( the simplest parametrization ) it has been carefully studied in detail recently @xcite .",
    "some other works with the constant parametrization has been also analyzed in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other parametrizations or more general approaches for the viscous models have been also proposed and studied at @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "another general approach to the bulk viscous cosmologies called `` fluids with inhomogeneous equation of state '' have been also proposed and studied by @xcite .    in section [ sectionhubbleparameterwithoutradiation ]",
    "we present the main formalism of bulk viscous fluids in general relativity ( gr ) and we apply it to the bulk viscous matter - dominated model studied in this work .",
    "we write the expression of @xmath3 in terms of the density parameter of the viscous matter component in function of the redshift . with the expression of @xmath3",
    "we find the explicit expression for the scale factor that will be used in section [ sectionscalefactor ] to analyze the possible scenarios for the universe according to the values of the _ dimensionless _ viscous coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in sections",
    "[ sectioncurvature ] and [ sectionmatterdensity ] we analyze the curvature scalars and the matter density to get a better understanding of the behavior of the universe according to the present model when it is evaluated at the best estimated values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in section [ sectionthermodynamics ]",
    "we do a brief review of the local second law of thermodynamics and its possible violation for these models .",
    "section [ sectionsnetest ] presents the sne ia probe to be used to constrain the model and to compute the best estimated values of @xmath13 .",
    "finally , in section [ sectionconclusions ] we give our conclusions .",
    "we analyze the cosmological model in a spatially flat universe framework . for that",
    ", we use the weinberg formalism @xcite of imperfect fluids .",
    "so , in the present work we consider a bulk viscous fluid as source of matter in the einstein fields equations @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the newton gravitational constant .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the bulk viscous matter component is that of an _ imperfect fluid _ with a first - order deviation from the thermodynamic equilibrium . it can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath16    where",
    "@xmath17    @xmath18 is the four - velocity vector of an observer who measures the energy density @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the pressure of the fluid of matter , the term @xmath21 is the metric tensor , the subscript `` m '' stands for `` matter '' component .",
    "the term @xmath22 is a _ bulk viscous _",
    "coefficient that arises in a fluid when it is out of the local thermodynamic equilibrium and that induces a _ viscous pressure _ equals to @xmath23 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the term @xmath24 is an _ effective _ pressure composed by the pressure @xmath20 of fluid plus the bulk viscous pressure .",
    "the effective pressure ( [ pressure ] ) was proposed by eckart @xcite in 1940 for relativistic dissipative processes in thermodynamics systems out of local equilibrium .",
    "later , landau & lifshitz developed also an equivalent formulation @xcite .",
    "the eckart theory has some problems in its formulation , for example , all the equilibrium states in this theory are unstable @xcite , other issue is that signals can propagate through the fluids faster than the speed of light @xcite . to correct the problems of the eckart theory , israel - stewart @xcite developed in 1979 a more consistent and general theory that avoids these issues from which the eckart theory is the first - order limit when the relaxation time goes to zero . in this limit",
    "the eckart theory is a good approximation to the israel - stewart theory .    in spite of the problems of the eckart theory , but taking advantage of the equivalence of both theories at this limit , it has been widely used by several authors because it is simpler to work with this than with the israel - stewart one . in particular , it has been used to model bulk viscous dark fluids as responsible of the observed acceleration of the universe assuming that the approximation of vanishing relaxation time is valid for this purpose ( see , for instance @xcite-@xcite , @xcite ) .    it is important to point out that hiscock @xcite showed that a flat friedmann - robertson - walker cosmological model with a bulk viscous boltzmann gas expands faster when the eckart framework is used than with the israel - stewart one .",
    "he suggests that the inflationary acceleration due to the bulk viscosity could be just an effect of using the uncausal eckart theory and not a real acceleration . however , posterior studies seem to show that this conclusion could be wrong because consistent inflationary solutions have been found using the israel - stewart theory @xcite",
    ".    the model could have a problem related with the cosmological density perturbations , where a rapid late time decay or irregular perturbations arise , leading to large modifications of the model lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath25cdm ) predictions for the matter power spectrum , cmb and weak lensing tests , as shown by b. li et al .",
    "however , hipolito et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that it is possible to have models with bulk viscosity proportional to @xmath26 that are compatible with the data from the 2dfgrs and the sdss surveys . due to the problem with the density perturbations , in the present work",
    "we assume that the viscosity appears only till recent times .",
    "it is convenient to mention that for irreversible processes , d. pavn et al .",
    "@xcite have developed a more general formulation than the israel - stewart theory , where the temperature could not be associated to the thermal equilibrium . however , in the cosmological scenario , this general formulation has not been totally explored .",
    "let s start assuming a spatially flat geometry for the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology as suggested by wmap @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the _ scale factor_. moreover , the conservation equation for the viscous fluid is @xmath29    we write this conservation equation using the frw metric as @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the _",

    "<S> we find that from all the possible scenarios for the universe , the preferred one by the best estimated values of @xmath4 is that of an expanding universe beginning with a big - bang , followed by a decelerated expansion at early times , and with a smooth transition in recent times to an accelerated expansion epoch that is going to continue forever . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted age of the universe is a little smaller than the mean value of the observational constraint coming from the oldest globular clusters but it is still inside of the confidence interval of this constraint . </S>",
    "<S> a drawback of the model is the violation of the local second law of thermodynamics in redshifts @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when we assume @xmath6 , the simple model @xmath7 evaluated at the best estimated value for @xmath1 satisfies the local second law of thermodynamics , the age of the universe is in perfect agreement with the constraint of globular clusters , and it also has a big - bang , followed by a decelerated expansion with the smooth transition to an accelerated expansion epoch in late times , that is going to continue forever . </S>"
