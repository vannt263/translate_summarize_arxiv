    "the functional - integral approach to quantum gravity was initiated in the 1970s and early 1980s by the monumental works of hawking , gibbons , coleman and others @xcite .",
    "quantum effects at first order in @xmath0 were computed in the stationary phase approximation through the zeta - function regularization technique .",
    "hawking also tackled the problem of the un - definiteness of the gravitational action and showed that the action is unbounded from below , due to conformal modes which can be integrated away .",
    "the non - conformal part of the action was assumed to be positive semi - definite and this conjecture was then proved in several special cases @xcite . later",
    ", the un - definiteness of the action and the continuation to imaginary time were studied by greensite , mazur and mottola and others @xcite .",
    "wetterich @xcite found that the effective action is always un - defined in sign .    in the 1990s , hamber and williams",
    "implemented numerically a discrete version of euclidean quantum gravity on a regge lattice and computed non - perturbative quantities like the effective coupling @xcite .",
    "the regge lattice approach also gives an insight into the cosmological constant problem , showing that a space with average null curvature can emerge dynamically from a full quantum theory which includes strong ( gravitational - only ) vacuum fluctuations .    in this work",
    "we shall consider pure gravity without any sources or matter fields , the action being given by the einstein - hilbert term plus the york - hawking - gibbons boundary term .",
    "we are thus looking at the vacuum state of quantum gravity .",
    "our main result concerns the existence of a class of static non - flat metrics with zero action , which should be taken into account when computing physical quantities in the functional - integral approach .",
    "in our previous work @xcite we found explicit expressions for these  zero - modes \" in the weak field approximation .",
    "they owe their existence to the non - positivity of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xmath2 .",
    "this feature makes possible a cancellation between positive and negative contributions to the integral of @xmath2 , arising from distinct spacetime regions .",
    "here we obtain a generalization of the zero - modes to the strong field case .",
    "the situation can be understood through a finite - dimensional analogy .",
    "imagine a system with an action which is not positive - definite .",
    "the stationary point corresponding to the classical theory will be a saddle point .",
    "the quantum configurations to order @xmath0 span a small area around the saddle point . we can possibly find a  level line \" ( fig .  [ saddle ] ) where the lagrangian has the same value it takes at the saddle point . starting from the classical configuration at the saddle point",
    ", the system can evolve along this level line .",
    "such lines do not exist , of course , for systems with positive - definite action .",
    "one should correctly object that level lines are subsets of null measure and do not contribute to an integration over the full space .",
    "but here the analogy fails to account for the complexity of a functional space .",
    "we shall prove that our strong - field zero - modes constitute a full - dimensional subset of the functional space of smooth , non - singular metrics , because they can be perturbed on an infinite - dimensional functional basis of the form @xmath3 .",
    "the oscillating weight factor @xmath4 in the functional integral ( where @xmath5 includes the boundary term ) is constant over this set .",
    "the next question is : how can we take these configurations into account for the computation of physical averages ?",
    "this is a very difficult task , and a problem in functional analysis which goes well beyond the traditional stationary - phase approximation . from the physical point of view",
    ", however , it seems clear that such strong vacuum fluctuations should make feel their presence in some way .",
    "one can envisage , for instance , some kind of gravitational casimir effect , where the variation of external constraints on the fluctuations results in observable vacuum forces .    in sect .",
    "[ search ] we use a  virtual source \" method to search for zero - modes of the action . in the context of wormholes physics @xcite this method",
    "is also called ",
    "reverse solution of the einstein equations \" ; it consists in finding a source which generates a metric with some desired features . in our case , the desired metric is not easy to define , because it must obey the non - linear integral condition @xmath6 . in the weak - field approximation",
    "this translates , up to terms of order @xmath7 , to the condition @xmath8 .",
    "while in wormholes physics it is necessary to minimize and justify in some way the recourse to un - physical matter , here we are free to introduce any source , provided it satisfies the bianchi identities . for weak fields it is sufficient to choose @xmath9 , leaving only the @xmath10 component , and build a virtual source satisfying the  dipolar \" condition @xmath11",
    "this can be made , for instance , by a positive - density core surrounded by a negative shell @xcite .    in the strong field case , however , the pressure components of @xmath12 are essential in order to satisfy the bianchi identity ; from numerical solutions of the oppenheimer - volkoff equations , it turns out that the pressure tends to diverge in the negative - density shell , even beyond the point where the mass - energy density has been cut off .",
    "this way of looking for quantum configurations , by introducing unusual sources in the classical equations , seems therefore to be ineffective .    in sect .",
    "[ direct ] we take a different , more straightforward approach .",
    "we consider the most general static symmetric metric and try to impose directly the zero - action condition .",
    "we obtain a closed solution in the special case of constant @xmath13 . in this case , the lagrangian density @xmath2 has a relatively simple expression in terms of @xmath14 , and we can invert this as a first - order differential equation for @xmath14 in terms of @xmath2 . setting @xmath15 , we obtain a family of non - flat metrics with zero scalar curvature , depending on a continuous parameter ( the  level line \" ) . replacing @xmath2 with an arbitrary periodic function with zero average , we obtain the more general zero - modes mentioned above .",
    "to first order in @xmath16 , the field @xmath17 generated by a mass - energy distribution @xmath18 is given by an integral of the field propagator @xmath19 over the source : @xmath20    in feynman gauge the propagator is given , with our conventions on the metric signature , by @xmath21    consider a static source in which only the component @xmath22 is non - zero . to order @xmath16 ,",
    "such a source automatically satisfies the bianchi identities .",
    "the field is @xmath23    the contracted form of the einstein equations allows us to compute the scalar curvature , for any solution , as the trace of the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath24 in our case , it is straightforward to check that @xmath25 , and so the einstein - hilbert action computed for the solution of the weak - field equation is @xmath26    provided the integral of the mass - energy density vanishes , the action of the field configuration is of order @xmath7 , i.e.  practically negligible in several cases .",
    "one can give several examples of  dipolar \" sources composed of positive and negative masses , either point - like or in the form of concentric shells , etc .",
    "some possible applications were mentioned in @xcite .      after giving an example of zero - modes in perturbation theory ,",
    "let us look for dipolar fluctuations with spherical symmetry using the same virtual source approach , but in strong field .",
    "our starting point is the well - known expression of the schwarzschild metric ( from @xcite , adapted to our conventions ) @xmath27    the function @xmath28 represents the mass contained in a 3-sphere of radius @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass density in the local inertial frame .",

    "these relations are often employed in relativistic astrophysical stellar models . in that context , it is also necessary to assign a positive @xmath41 ; this is not necessary in our case because the source can be un - physical .",
    "we try to assign @xmath41 in such a way to obtain metrics for which the integral @xmath42 is zero , by placing a negative - mass shell around the positive core , as done in the weak - field case .    as a first example , let us consider a core with constant positive mass density @xmath43 , and let @xmath44 be the corresponding schwarzschild radius @xmath45    this is the radius at which a singularity would arise , if the mass distribution was not cut before that point .",

    "it is already apparent from the form of ( [ p - adim ] ) that the pressure can in general diverge , because the derivative of @xmath73 is proportional to @xmath73 itself , when the density @xmath74 is small . in the usual astrophysical models",
    ", @xmath73 goes rapidly to zero when @xmath29 increases , and then @xmath74 vanishes , too , at the star surface ; in this way , @xmath73 stays zero outside the star , as it is physically obvious .",
    "one would therefore expect that @xmath75 outside a certain radius , and that the zero - mode condition can be satisfied by cutting @xmath74 .    in the present case",
    ", however , the situation is more tricky .",
    "the numerical solutions show that the pressure actually decreases quickly in the positive density core , but keeps non - zero in the outer negative - density shell .",
    "if the mass density is cut at @xmath36 , the pressure begins to grow exponentially in the negative direction with a strange self - amplification effect ( fig .",
