    "since high tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) was first observed at room temperature,@xcite magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) have been a focus of interest .",
    "extensive research has been carried out to understand and improve the properties of mtjs . a huge increase in tmr with lower junction resistance",
    "was achieved when alo@xmath0 tunnel barriers were replaced by mgo , and this was followed by realizations of memory devices based on mtjs with mgo barriers.@xcite tunneling current in the mtj is spin polarized , which adds another dimension to the tunneling effect , and scientific attention has thus been drawn to the spin - dependent tunneling phenomenon . when a nonmagnetic ( nm ) layer is inserted between a ferromagnetic ( fm ) layer and the insulating ( i ) tunnel barrier of the mtj ,",
    "the spin polarization of the tunneling current changes and the tmr is directly affected .",
    "an early theoretical work predicted the oscillatory tmr as a function of the nm thickness due to the quantum well states inside the nm layer.@xcite in sputtered samples , it has been shown that an nm layer between the tunnel barrier and fm layer could be detrimental to tmr , and the tmr decreases as a function of nm thickness.@xcite these experimental results have been explained theoretically with a free electron model , and the decay of tmr was attributed to a loss of coherence in the electron propagation.@xcite different experimental results have been obtained for a crystalline nm layer inserted between the tunnel barrier and the fm layer .",
    "et al._@xcite experimentally investigated the dependence of tmr on cu thickness in nife / alo@xmath0/cu / co junctions with samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "they found that the tmr decayed but oscillated as a function of cu thickness .",
    "the oscillation period was determined by the nesting feature of the cu fermi surface .",
    "this oscillatory tmr has been investigated theoretically based on a single - band tight - binding model , a free - electron model , and full - band calculations.@xcite many features have been explained with calculations using simple models , but direct comparisons with the experimental data are difficult because realistic electronic structures were not considered .",
    "the full - band calculations are very useful for the description of real systems .",
    "however they are time consuming , and sometimes it is not easy to understand the underlying physics .",
    "furthermore , full - band calculations are usually carried out for an ideal situation , and significant discrepancies often occur between theory and experiments .",
    "we introduce an analytical expression that describes the dependence of tmr on nm thickness for fm / i / nm / fm junctions based on full - band structures .",
    "our approach uses the generalization of a previously described single - band case@xcite to a multiple - band case that considers the real materials .",
    "the tmr is expressed with transmission and reflection amplitudes of single interfaces at the fermi level , and extremal wave vectors .",
    "the full - band structures of the materials are taken into account in our proposed model , and the calculation of several transmission and reflection amplitudes with real band structures can make a direct comparison with experimental results possible .",
    "based on our model , selection rules for the oscillation period are discussed , and we suggest that very few oscillation periods will be observed in experiments even when there are many extremal spanning vectors of the nm fermi surface .",
    "this situation is very different than the interlayer exchange coupling in magnetic multilayers .",
    "our model explicitly shows that tmr dependence on nm thickness is affected by the thickness of the tunnel barrier , and predicts that the tmr will go to zero as the nm thickness increases . to check the validity of our model",
    ", we carried out numerical calculations using an envelope - function theory for several cases including nm material with a fermi surface similar to the cu(001 ) case .",
    "although our model is calculated using the parameters at the fermi level and the extremal wave vector , it is in good agreement with the exact numerical results .",

    ", @xmath129 is exactly the extremal spanning vector of the nm fermi surface .    the extremal spanning vector @xmath129 of the nm fermi surface gives rise to the period of the tmr oscillation . in principle , multiple periods are possible depending on the shape of the nm fermi surface .",

    "the extremal points of the nm fermi surface hardly coincide with the maxima point of @xmath130 of the tunnel barrier .",
    "thus , only few periods would be observable among the possible periods from the extremal spanning vectors . compared with the oscillation of the interlayer exchange coupling for a corresponding spacer , fewer periods would be observed in tmr oscillation . moreover , as @xmath138 increases , @xmath139 decreases rapidly as a function of @xmath98 away from the maxima .",
    "thus , the multiple periods would be more difficult to observe for a thicker tunnel barrier .",
    "since @xmath140 is material dependent , the period of tmr oscillation could change for a different tunneling barrier . in eq .",
    "( [ e : delgsingle ] ) , the extra phase factor arises from the square root in the denominator .",
    "this extra phase factor is @xmath2 dependent , and the measured oscillation period will be slightly different from @xmath141 .",

    "thus , the short period is intrinsically invisible , and only the long period could be observed .",
    "there are four possible oscillation periods in nife / alo@xmath0/cu(110)/co junctions from the cu fermi surface along the ( 110 ) direction.@xcite among them , the only observable period is the extremal spanning vector corresponding to @xmath132 .",
    "this period is very short and would be easily wiped out by the interface roughness .",
    "thus , it would be difficult to observe a tmr oscillation in this system .",
    "there is only one possible period for cu(111)@xcite and this period has been observed experimentally in the interlayer exchange coupling of co / cu(111)/co multilayers.@xcite however , this period would not be observed in nife / alo@xmath0/cu(111)/co junctions because the corresponding extremal spanning vector is far from @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , except for the long period of nife / alo@xmath0/cu(001)/co junctions , it would be difficult to observe a tmr oscillation as a function of cu thickness .",
    "the situation for the au and ag spacers will be same as in the case of cu because the shapes of the fermi surfaces are similar .",
    "in the fe / cr / fe multilayers , the long periods of interlayer coupling oscillation have been observed as a function of the cr thickness for the ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , and ( 211 ) orientations.@xcite however , these long periods would not be observed experimentally in fe / alo@xmath0/cr / fe or fe / mgo / cr / fe tunnel junctions because the long periods are from the @xmath142 point of the cr fermi surface,@xcite which is away from @xmath132 for any orientation . in experiments ,",
    "this long period has not been observed for fe / alo@xmath0/cr(001)/fe ( ref .  ) and fe / mgo / cr(001)/fe ( ref .  )",
    "tunnel junctions .",
    "usually , the long period is clearly observed because it is not eliminated by the interface roughness .",
    "although we discussed the case that the tunneling is dominated by perpendicularly incident electrons , the analysis is similar when the tunneling probability is maximum or high away from @xmath132 . if the dependence of the tunneling probability on @xmath98 changes with a different tunnel barrier , the tmr dependence on the nm spacer will be altered accordingly .",
    "still , the crucial criterion is whether the tunneling probability is significant or not at the point of the extremal spanning vectors of the nm fermi surface in the @xmath98 space . except special points , the chances are that the point of the maximum tunneling probability does not coincide with the position of the extremal spanning vectors of the nm fermi surface in the @xmath98 space .",
    "thus many oscillations inferred from the nm fermi surface would not be observed .",
    "when the tunnel barrier is extremely thin , the situation can be much different because the tunneling probability dependence on @xmath98 may change significantly .",
    "more oscillation periods can be observed with thinner tunnel barriers . even in this case , the oscillation periods associated with relatively high tunneling probability will be observed .",
    "without the scattering effect , @xmath84 and tmr decays as @xmath143 for a thick nm layer .",
    "however , for thin nm layers , the decay rate is slower than @xmath143 and is affected by the tunnel barrier thickness @xmath138 , and also by @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( @xmath98 dependence of the reflection - amplitude phase factors ) .",
    "the amplitude decays much more slowly than @xmath143 for coherent transport when @xmath2 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath138 . in experiments ,",
    "the tmr oscillation decays much faster than @xmath143 , which seems to be due to scattering . as the nm thickness increases",

    ", the tmr reaches a finite value when the nm thickness becomes infinite . at first sight , this seems to contradict our analytical formula eq .",
    "( [ e : delgsingle ] ) given in sec",
    "the reason for finite tmr at infinite @xmath2 can be explained as follows .",
    "we obtained @xmath197 from the dispersion relation at the fermi level .",
    "when the magnetizations of the fm layers are antiparallel , electrons with the majority spin in the fm(l ) layer do not penetrate to the fm(r ) layer for @xmath198 because @xmath6 becomes imaginary in the fm(r ) layer .",
    "the electrons with the majority spin for @xmath199 in the fm(l ) layer are totally reflected at the nm / fm(r ) interface due to the potential step and do not contribute to conduction .",
    "thus , @xmath200 is underestimated and gives rise to a finite @xmath84 and consequently a finite tmr , even when the nm layer is infinite , as long as the transport is coherent .",
    "this is more pronounced for a larger @xmath153 , lower barrier height , and thinner tunneling barrier because a larger portion of electrons with the fermi energy will be completely reflected at the nm / fm(r ) interface . when deriving eq .",
    "( [ e : delg ] ) in sec .",
    "ii , we considered multiple reflection inside the nm layer to calculate the transmission , and we assumed that once the electrons tunnel through the tunnel barrier , most of them flow to the fm(r ) layer after multiple reflections .",
    "however , in the ap magnetizations of fm layers of the free - electron model , the electrons with majority spin for @xmath201 in the fm(l ) layer can not penetrate into the fm(r ) layer after tunneling because of the potential step , resulting in a finite tmr for the infinite nm layer . to clarify this point ,",

    "the fm(r ) layer behaves like a potential barrier for electrons with the majority spin and @xmath202 in the fm(l ) layer .",
    "however , the tmr goes to zero as the nm thickness increases . when the fm(r ) layer is not too thick , the tunneling probability through this potential barrier is larger than that through the tunnel barrier ( i ) , and most of electrons with majority spin and @xmath202 in the fm(l ) layer eventually flow to the nm(r ) layer once they tunnel through the insulating barrier . even for the infinite fm(r ) layer ,",
    "the tmr for the infinite nm layer becomes negligible as @xmath153 increases , the thickness of the tunnel barrier increases , and the barrier height increases .",
    "this is because only a small portion of electrons with the fermi energy will be completely reflected at the nm / fm(r ) interface .",
    "also , if the minority spin band of the fm layer is set to be the same as the nm band , the tmr goes to zero as the nm thickness increases because there is no total reflection at the nm / fm(r ) interface .",
    "the finite tmr for the infinite nm layer is possible when a significant portion of electrons with the fermi energy have less transmission probability into the fm(r ) layer than that through the tunnel barrier .",
    "complete reflection of electrons at the interface between two metals may occur for some given @xmath163 at the fermi level due to the mismatch of the electronic states .",

    "thus , it is unrealistic to expect a finite tmr as the nm thickness increases in experiments .",
    "we calculated the tmr of fm / i / nm / fm tunnel junctions .",
    "the tmr was calculated as a function of nm thickness using the landaur - bttiker formula .",
    "multiple band structures were included and an analytical form describing the tmr was obtained .",
    "conductance was calculated from the summation of the transmission over @xmath203 .",
    "the transmission was obtained by considering multiple reflections between the i / nm and nm / fm interfaces .",
    "the summation over @xmath204 was carried out analytically .",
    "the contribution was mainly from the extremal point in @xmath205-space that was determined from the combination of the nm fermi surface and the @xmath204-dependence of the transmission coefficient of the fm / i / nm junction .",
    "the tmr was expressed with the transmission coefficient of the fm / i / nm junction , reflection amplitudes at the nm / i and nm / fm interfaces at the fermi level , and the extremal wave vector .",
    "many oscillation periods can be inferred from the shape of the nm fermi surface , but they can be observed only when the corresponding spin asymmetry of the transmission coefficient is significant .",
    "we suggest that only few oscillation periods are likely to be observed in real experiments .",
    "when the nm spacer is thin , our proposed model indicates that the decay of the tmr was slower than the inverse of the space thickness for coherent transport .",
    "numerical calculations were performed to investigate the accuracy of the proposed formula .",
    "an envelope - function theory was adopted , and our model was compared to the exact result .",
    "we showed that the results of the proposed formula are in good agreement with the exact calculations .",
    "the tmr dependence on the thickness of the nm spacer was affected by the tunnel barrier thickness , which was well described by our formula .",
    "the numerical calculation was extended to the case with multiple extremal spanning vectors in the fermi surface of the nm spacer .",
    "our proposed formula is in good agreement with the exact result , and only the oscillation period with significant spin asymmetry of the transmission coefficient was observed as predicted using our formula . when the tunneling probability associated with each extremal spanning vectors of the nm fermi surface is low , the tmr decays very fast as the nm thickness increases .",
    "a free - electron case was also considered .",
    "the nm band was assumed to be the same as the majority spin band of the fm layer , and spin - splitting in the fm layer was assumed to be rather large .",
    "the tmr approached a finite value as the nm thickness increased .",
    "this was because a large portion of electrons with the majority spin in the left fm layer were reflected completely at the right nm / fm interface .",
    "when the semi - infinite fm layer on the right side was replaced by a finite layer , the tmr decayed to zero as the nm thickness increased . as long as the transmission into the fm layer was higher than that through the tunnel barrier , the tmr became zero as the thickness of the nm spacer increased .",
    "we suggest that finite tmr for the infinite nm spacer is unrealistic in real experiments .",
