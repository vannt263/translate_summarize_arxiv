    "the method of qcd sum rules @xmath5 has proved to be particularly useful in heavy quark physics , where a small distance scale is provided by the inverse heavy quark mass . in order to calculate form factors of heavy hadrons",
    "one can consider suitable three - point vacuum correlation functions and apply the operator product expansion in terms of vacuum condensates which take into account nonperturbative quark - gluon dynamics .",
    "some recent calculations along these lines can be found in refs .",
    "@xmath7 . in this report",
    "we present an alternative , more economical method based on an expansion of vacuum - to - pion matrix elements near the light - cone .",
    "this method is used in ref .",
    "@xmath8 to calculate the   and   form factors .",
    "after outlining the calculational procedure we show numerical results and discuss their sensitivity to various input parameters .",
    "we also compare our predictions with other estimates .",
    "for definiteness , we focus on the @xmath9 form factor @xmath10 entering the matrix element = 2f_d^+(p^2)q_+ [ f_d^+(p^2)+f_d^-(p^2)]p_[form ] with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the @xmath14 and @xmath15 momenta and the momentum transfer , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath16 form factor @xmath17 can be treated in parallel by obvious formal replacements .",
    "these form factors are measurable in @xmath18 semileptonic decays .    let us consider the matrix element f_(p , q)= i d^4xe^ipx(q)t\\{|d(x)_c(x ) ,    @xmath19 between the vacuum and an on - shell pion state .",
    "this object is represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "1 . the pion momentum squared , @xmath20 , vanishes in the chiral limit adopted throughout this discussion .",
    "then , contracting the @xmath21-quark fields in ( [ 1a ] ) and keeping only the lowest order term , i.e. the free @xmath21-quark propagator , yields f ( ( p+q)^2,p^2)= i d^4x e^i(p - p)x _ a  , [ f ] where _",
    "a(x^2 , qx ) = < ( q)|d(x)_a u(0)0 >  , [ phi ] @xmath22 denoting certain combinations of dirac matrices .",
    "this approximation corresponds to fig .",
    "if @xmath23 is taken sufficiently large and negative , and the time - like momentum transfer squared @xmath24 is far from the kinematical limit , @xmath25 , the @xmath21-quark propagating between the points @xmath26 and @xmath27 is far off - shell . in that case",
    ", it is justified to keep only the first few terms in the expansion of the matrix elements ( [ phi ] ) around @xmath28 , that is near the light - cone : _",
    "a(x^2 , q x ) = _ n _ 0 ^ 1 du_a^n(u)exp(iuqx )   ( x^2)^n [ phi1 ]  .",
    "the form of the expansion is dictated by translational invariance .",
    "logarithms in @xmath29 which may also appear in ( [ phi1 ] ) are disregarded for simplicity .",
    "these terms can be consistently treated by means of qcd perturbation theory .",
    "they give rise to normalization scale dependence . inserting ( [ phi1 ] ) into ( [ f ] ) and integrating over @xmath26 and @xmath30 , one obtains , schematically , f((p+q)^2 ,",
    "p^2 ) = _ a _",
    "n ^1_0 du  .",
    "[ f1 ] it is thus possible to calculate the invariant function @xmath31 with reasonable accuracy in the kinematical region of highly virtual @xmath21-quarks provided one knows the distribution functions @xmath32 at least for low values of @xmath33 .",
    "the latter are nothing but the light - cone wave functions of the pion introduced in the context of hard exclusive processes @xmath34 .",
    "the leading twist 2 wave function is defined by = -if_q_^1_0 du e^iuq x _ ( u )  , [ tw2 ] where the exponential factor involving the gluon field is necessary for gauge invariance . the asymptotic form of @xmath35 is well known : @xmath36 . in our calculation of @xmath37 and @xmath38 we have included quark - antiquark wave functions up to twist four .",
    "in addition , we have also calculated the first - order correction to the free @xmath39-quark propagation shown in fig .",
    "1b which involves quark - antiquark - gluon wave functions of twist 3 and four . on the other hand , the perturbative @xmath40 corrections corresponding to inserting gluon exchanges between quark lines in fig .",
    "1a have not been evaluated directly but have only been taken into account in a rough indirect way , as explained below .    in order to extract the desired form factor @xmath37 from the result on the invariant function @xmath41 sketched in ( [ f1 ] )",
    "we employ a qcd sum rule with respect to the @xmath14-meson channel . writing a dispersion relation in @xmath23 ,",
    "we approximate the hadronic spectral function in the @xmath14-channel by the pole contribution of the @xmath14 meson and a continuum contribution . in accordance with quark - hadron duality ,",
    "the latter is identified with the spectral function derived from the qcd representation ( [ f1 ] ) above the threshold @xmath42 .",
    "formally , subtraction of the continuum then amounts to simply changing the lower integration boundary in ( 7 ) from 0 to @xmath43 .",
    "after borel transformation one arrives at a sum rule for the product @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the @xmath14 meson decay constant : @xmath46 \\phi_2(u , m^2,p^2)\\ ] ] @xmath47 _ 3(u,_1,_2 , m^2,p^2 ) }  , [ formsr ] where _ 2 = _ ( u ) + + ...  , [ phi2 ] _ 3= _",
    "3(_1,1-_1-_2,_2 ) + ... [ phi3 ] here , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 represent twist 3 pion wave functions , while the ellipses denote contributions of higher twist .",
    "the contributions of twist 4 are given explicitly in refs .",
    "the analogous sum rule for the @xmath52 form factor follows from the above by formally changing @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the numerical values to be substituted for @xmath55 , @xmath45 and the threshold @xmath56 are interrelated by the qcd sum rule for the two - point correlation function @xmath57 0 @xmath58 0 @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "this sum rule should be used without @xmath40 corrections in order to be consistent with the neglect of these corrections in the sum rule for @xmath44 given above . a similar interrelation exists for @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 from the analogous correlation function of @xmath64 flavoured currents . for the wave functions we use the parametrization suggested in ref .",
    "other details on the choice of parameters are given in refs .",
    "@xmath51 .",
    "the form factor @xmath37 derived from ( [ formsr ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "2 as a function of borel mass squared @xmath66 . numerically , the twist 3 contributions turn out to be more important than the nonasymptotic corrections to the leading twist 2 wave function . in the range 3",
    "@xmath67 5 gev@xmath6 the corrections due to twist 4 in ( [ formsr ] ) remain subdominant and , simultaneously , the contribution from excited and continuum states does not exceed @xmath68 . restricting oneself to this interval ,",
    "one obtains the value @xmath69 for the @xmath9 form factor at zero momentum transfer .",
    "the analogous fiducial interval for the @xmath70 form factor is 8 @xmath71 12 gev@xmath6 yielding @xmath72 .",
    "the maximum momentum transfer @xmath24 to which these sum rules are applicable is estimated to be about 1 gev@xmath6 for @xmath37 and about 15 gev@xmath73 for @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath74dependence of both form factors is plotted in fig .",
    "it is important to investigate the theoretical uncertainties in these results .",
    "two main sources are the nonasymptotic corrections to the leading twist wave function @xmath35 and to the twist 3 three - particle wave function @xmath50 . in order to estimate the sensitivity of our results to these corrections",
    "we drop them and recalculate the form factors . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3 , the result changes by less than 10 % .",
    "summarizing our investigations , in fig .",
    "4 we compare our predictions on @xmath75 and @xmath76 with the results of other calculations . within the uncertainties there is satisfactory agreement . in particular , we would like to emphasize the coincidence with the result @xmath77 derived from conventional qcd sum rule @xmath6 in which the large - distance effects are parametrized in terms of vacuum condensates rather than by pion wave functions on the light - cone . on the other hand ,",
    "the value @xmath78 obtained in ref .",
    "@xmath79 is smaller than ours .",
    "also the @xmath24-dependence of the form factors is rather similar in the different approaches .",
    "note , however , that in the quark model @xmath80 the momentum dependence of the form factors is not predicted but simply assumed to be given by a single pole : f^+(p^2 ) = [ 21a ] with @xmath81 2.01 gev in the case of @xmath37 and @xmath825.3 gev for @xmath83 as expected in the spirit of vector dominance .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xmath7 have fitted their calculated shape for @xmath84 to the form ( [ 21a ] ) and obtained @xmath85 gev for @xmath37 and @xmath86 gev for @xmath38 . in comparison to",
    "that we find a somewhat steeper @xmath24-dependence .    in conclusion , we emphasize that light - cone sum rules such as the ones exemplified in this report represent a well defined alternative to the conventional qcd sum rule method . in this variant ,",
    "the nonperturbative aspects are described by a set of wave functions on the light - cone with varying twist and quark - gluon multiplicity .",
    "these universal functions can be studied in a variety of processes involving the @xmath15 and @xmath87 meson , or other light mesons . the main problem to be solved",
    "if one wants to fully exploit the light - cone approach is the reliable determination of the nonasymptotic effects in the wave functions . in this respect ,",
    "measurements of hadronic form factors , couplings etc . can provide important information . a second ,",
    "mainly technical problem , concerns the higher order perturbative corrections which are still unknown .",
    "the most important advantage of the light - cone sum rules is the possibility to take light hadrons on mass - shell from the very beginning .",
    "one thus avoids the notorious model - dependence of extrapolations from euclidean to physical momenta in light channels .",
    "furthermore , in many cases the light - cone approach is technically much easier than a conventional qcd sum rule calculation . finally , the light - cone method is rather versatile .",
    "it can also be profitably employed to calculate heavy - to - light form factors such as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , amplitudes of rare decays @xmath90 and hadronic couplings such as @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath93 .",
