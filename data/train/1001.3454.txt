    "the concept of geometric phase ( gp ) in quantum system was originally introduced by berry @xcite when he studied the dynamics of a closed quantum system which undergoes an adiabatic cyclic evolution .",
    "he found that besides the usual dynamical phase , the system also acquires an additional phase which only depends on the geometry of the path traversed by the system during its adiabatic evolution .",
    "since then this important notion has attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "it has been generalized in various aspects , e.g. the gp for non - adiabatic evolution @xcite and for noncyclic evolution @xcite .",
    "the gp has been observed experimentally in optical @xcite , nmr @xcite , and superconducting electronic circuit experiments @xcite .",
    "recently , the renewed interest in the investigation of gp comes from the application of gp to implement the logic gates in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the purely geometric nature of the phase makes such computation intrinsically fault - tolerant and robust against certain types of classical fluctuation noise @xcite .",
    "however , any realistic quantum system is inevitably coupled to its surrounding environment , which would result in the loss of quantum coherence ( i.e. the decoherence ) of the quantum system itself and hence limit the implementation of the geometric quantum computation .",
    "therefore , the study of the gp in open quantum systems becomes an important issue .",
    "for the gp of mixed states in open systems , uhlmann was the first to make the attempt to define the mixed - state gp via state purification @xcite .",
    "proposed an alternative definition for the nondegenerate mixed - state density matrix under unitary evolution based on the interferometry @xcite .",
    "this definition was further generalized to degenerate mixed state by singh _",
    "_ @xcite and to the nonunitary evolution by tong _",
    "_ @xcite using the kinematic approach .",
    "the gp associated with such a nonunitary evolution is defined as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , are the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix of the quantum system , and @xmath3 is the time after the system completes a cyclic evolution when it is isolated from the environment .",
    "taking the environment into account , the system no longer undergoes a cyclic evolution . here a quasicyclic process with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the frequency of the system , is considered in eq .",
    "( [ gpt ] ) .",
    "defined a mixed - state gp in the context of pantcharatnam formula @xcite via mapping the density matrix to a nonunit vector ray in complex projective hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the mixed - state gp has been observed in nmr system @xcite .    because the environment induced decoherence would affect the performance of the quantum computation using gp , the study of environment effects on the gp is highly desired .",
    "many works along this line have been performed within markovian approximation @xcite , which is valid only when the interaction between the system and the environment is very weak and the environmental correlation time is very small . however , in many quantum information experiments , these conditions are not completely satisfied . for example , in cavity qed experiment the imperfection of the cavity mirrors makes the cavity field having a lorentzian spectrum expansion , which acts as an environment , would exert a strong non - markovian effect on the atom in it @xcite .",
    "there are also some works on the non - markovian effect on the gp in dephasing environments @xcite , where there is no energy / information exchange between the system and its environment .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the study of the gp of open two - level system to the situation where there has an energy / information exchange between the system and its environment .",
    "the environment is at zero - temperature and has a lorentzian spectral density , which corresponds to the radiation field as an environment being confined in a leaky cavity .",
    "we mainly concentrate on how the non - markvoain effect affects the gp in different parameter regimes of the spectral density , and how the gp manifests its robustness against the decoherence .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mode ] , we introduce the model of a qubit interacting with a vacuum environment and analyze its decoherence behavior . in sec .",
    "[ geometric ] we evaluate the gp of the qubit via performing analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "the correction effect exerted by the environment on the gp in different parameter regimes of the lorentzian spectral density is analyzed .",
    "finally , a brief discussion and summary are given in sec .",
    "let us consider a system consisted of a two - level atom ( qubit ) coupled to a radiation field at zero temperature as an environment .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is scully97 @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the inversion operators and transition frequency of the qubit , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath11-th mode with frequency @xmath12 of the radiation field , and @xmath13 is the coupling strength between the qubit and reservoir . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath14 .",
    "the system models the decoherence process of the atom via the amplitude decaying under the born - markovian approximation , which results in the spontaneous emission of the two - level atom @xcite in quantum optics .",
    "the model is exactly solvable .",
    "the decoherence dynamics of the qubit is governed by the master equation @xcite @xmath15+\\gamma ( t)[2\\sigma _ { -}\\rho ( t)\\sigma _ { + }   \\notag \\\\ & & -\\sigma _ { + } \\sigma _ { -}\\rho ( t)-\\rho ( t)\\sigma _ { + } \\sigma _ { - } ] , \\label{mstt}\\end{aligned}\\]]where the time - dependent parameters are given by @xmath16,~\\gamma ( t)=-\\text{re}[\\frac{% \\dot{c}(t)}{c(t ) } ] .",
    "\\label{coe}\\]]it is shown that @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the environmental correlation function with the spectral density defined as @xmath20 and the initial condition @xmath21 .",
    "the time - dependent parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 play the roles of lamb shifted frequency and decay rate of the qubit , respectively .",
    "the integro - differential equation ( [ c0 ] ) contains the memory effect of the reservoir registered in the time - nonlocal kernel function and thus the dynamics of qubit displays non - markovian effect .",
    "if the time - nonlocal kernel function is replaced by a time - local one , then eq . ( [ mstt ] ) recovers the conventional master equation under markovian approximation .",
    "it is obvious that the memory effect registered in the kernel function @xmath24 is essentially determined by the spectral density @xmath25 . in this work",
    "we explicitly consider that the spectral density has a lorentzian form @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coupling constant between the qubit and the environment , and @xmath28 defines the spectral width of the coupling at the resonance point @xmath8 .",
    "the lorentzian spectral density describes that the vacuum radiation field as the environment is confined in a leaky cavity . due to the leakage of the cavity field induced by the imperfection of the cavity mirrors",
    ", the spectrum of the cavity field displays a broadening at the resonance point regarding the atomic transition frequency @xmath5 . in this case",
    "one can verify that the correlation function decays exponentially @xmath29 @xcite , which means that the parameter @xmath28 characterizes the correlation time of the environment as @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath31 is comparable with the typical time scale of the system , i.e. @xmath32 , then the memory effect of the environment should not be neglected and the decoherence dynamics in this situation is non - markovian . while @xmath33 , the memory effect of the environment is negligible and the decoherence dynamics is markovian . in the ideal cavity limit @xmath34",
    ", we have @xmath35 , which corresponds to a constant kernel @xmath36 .",
    "then the system reduces to the jaynes - cummings model with a vacuum rabi frequency @xmath37 .    going back to the general case",
    ", one can obtain the analytical form of @xmath17 by substituting the exponentially decaying @xmath38 into eq .",
    "( [ c0 ] ) as @xmath39,\\]]where @xmath40 .",
    "so the parameters in the master equation can be calculated readily @xmath41 one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ gf ] ) when @xmath28 is much larger than other frequency scale , the decay rate tends to a constant value @xmath42 , which just characterizes the decoherence behavior of the qubit under the markovian dynamics .",
    "in the following we compute explicitly the gp of the qubit .",
    "we assume that the initial state of the qubit is chosen as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the excited and ground states of the qubit , respectively .",
    "this state corresponds to a vector in bloch sphere with polar angle @xmath46 .",
    "the time - dependent reduced density matrix of the qubit under the initial condition ( [ istate ] ) can be obtained straightforwardly from the master equation ( [ mstt ] ) @xmath47 it is noted that besides the off - diagonal elements , the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath48 also change with time in our model .",
    "it is just this time - dependence of the diagonal elements of @xmath48 characterizing the energy exchange between the qubit and its environment that makes our system shows dramatic difference to the dephasing model @xcite . to calculate the gp of the qubit",
    ", we must firstly get the eigensolution of the reduced density matrix ( [ rdm ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the above reduced density are readily calculated , @xmath49 ,   \\label{eigenv}\\ ] ] it is obvious that the eigenvalue @xmath50 , which , from eq . ( gpt )",
    ", means that the component of the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath51 gives no contribution to the gp .",
    "thus we only need to consider the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath52",
    "@xmath53where@xmath54    below we calculate the gp .",
    "( [ gf ] ) shows that the frequency shift of the qubit is zero for the lorentzian spectral density @xcite",
    ". so the period of the environment disturbed atom is the same as the one for a bare atom .",
    "then the gp of the qubit acquired after a period @xmath55 can be calculated as @xmath56 here we point out that the expression of the gp ( [ gp2 ] ) has been obtained by using the kinematic approach @xcite .",
    "however , it can be shown that the expression is exactly the same as the one obtained by the definition of pantcharatnam s phase of a nonunit vector ray @xcite , which exhibits some essential features of the gp in such systems .    from eq .",
    "( [ gp2 ] ) , one can notes that the effect of the environment enters into the gp solely via the time - dependent factor @xmath57 of the excited - state population .",
    "when the environment is absent , then @xmath58 and the gp reduces to @xmath59 , which is just the gp acquired by a two - level atom in the unitary dynamics . depending on the decoherence dynamics being markovian or non - markovian , the short - time dynamics of @xmath57 shows remarkably different behaviors . in the markovian dynamics",
    ", @xmath57 decays monotonically and finally approaches zero . in this case , the larger the decay rate @xmath60 is , the larger the correction of the gp should be . in",
    "the non - markovian dynamics , contributed from the memory effect of the environment @xmath57 shows transient oscillation with time , which naturally induces a correction of the gp different to the one in markovian dynamics , as shown in the following .    up to the first order of coupling strength @xmath61 , i.e. the weak coupling limit , we have@xmath62 where @xmath63 $ ] . besides the leading term @xmath64 corresponding to the well - known gp acquired under the unitary dynamics , the second term , which is quadratic in @xmath65 with a @xmath66-dependent coefficient @xmath67 , is the lowest - order correction to the gp induced by non - unitary dynamics due to the interaction with the environment .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath67 is a monotonically decreasing function with the increase of @xmath66 , so we can expect that the gp shows a larger deviation to @xmath64 for a small @xmath66 than a large one . in particular , in the ideal cavity limit @xmath34 , the function @xmath67 arrives at its maximum @xmath68 , where the gp has a largest correction in this weak coupling ( or small @xmath27 ) regime . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath69 , one can verify @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , the gp in this markovian limit is @xmath71 which shows very similar form to the result of @xcite obtained from the born - markovian master equation .      in the following",
    "we give the exact gp via numerically evaluating the integration in eq .",
    "( [ gp2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ sle ] we plot the exact gp as a function of the coupling constant and the initial polar angle . when @xmath72 , the correlation time of the environment @xmath73 is much less than the typical time scale of the system @xmath74 .",
    "in this situation , the memory effect of the environment is negligible and the dynamics of the system is markovian .",
    "consequently , the energy and the information flow single - directionally from the system to the environment , which results in the dissipation to the system . the dissipation time scale in this markovian dynamics is characterized by @xmath75 .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ sle](a ) that the gp in this situation decreases monotonically with the increase of the coupling constant .",
    "this is understandable that a larger coupling constant would induce a stronger dissipation and a short decoherence time scale @xmath76 to the qubit system .",
    "with the increase of @xmath27 , @xmath76 approaches @xmath3 , which means that the dissipation becomes more and more notable within the time scale @xmath3 . on the other hand , when @xmath27 is small the gp shows small deviation to the unitary one @xmath64 .",
    "in this situation , @xmath76 is larger than @xmath3 , making the dissipation negligible within the time scale @xmath3 during which the gp is accumulated .",
    "this interesting phenomenon just reflects the resilient ability of the gp to the environment s disturbance , especially in weak coupling limit .",
    "a similar phenomenon is also observed in the dephasing model @xcite .",
    "when @xmath77 , @xmath78 and the non - markovian effect induced by the memory effect of the environment to the system would show its distinct impact on the the dynamics of the system .",
    "besides the dissipation , the environment also exerts a dynamical backaction on the system @xcite . the backaction effect is reflected in that the energy and the information flow back and forth between the system and the environment .",
    "in this situation we can see in fig .",
    "[ sle](b ) that the gp oscillates with the increase of @xmath27 and then tends to a definite value , which is qualitatively different to the above markovian situation .",
    "the oscillation is just the manifestation of the dynamical backaction .",
    "it is very clear that the non - zero character of the gp in the case of large @xmath27 is due to the counteracted competition between the backaction and dissipation exerted by the non - markovian environment partially , which weakens the decoherence of the qubit system .    a more clear comparison of the gp with different @xmath66 as a function of @xmath27 when @xmath79 is shown in fig .",
    "[ td ] . as comparisons ,",
    "the perturbed results for @xmath80 and @xmath81 are also presented in this figure and they agree well with the corresponding exact one only in the weak coupling limit .",
    "we can see obviously that in the weak coupling regime the environment with a large @xmath66 induces a smaller correction to the gp than the one with a small @xmath66 .",
    "that is , the non - markovian effect has a strong correction to the gp in this weak coupling regime .",
    "this is consistent with the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a phenomenological analysis of the non - markovian effect on the gp is performed .",
    "while in the strong coupling regime the situation is opposite , because the system with a large-@xmath66 shows stronger decoherence than the one with a small @xmath66 where the non - markovian effect has a strong correction to the gp .    even till",
    "today it is still difficult to access experimentally the strong coupling regime in the cavity qed platform .",
    "for example , in a recent microtoroidal resonator experiment @xcite , the achieved coupling strength between the atom and the cavity field is 90mhz , while the damping rate of the cavity field is about 180mhz .",
    "such a large damping rate would induce a noticeable spectrum expansion of the cavity mode .",
    "it is of course interesting to examine the gp in this bad - cavity and weak coupling regime . in fig .",
    "[ ws ] we plot the gp as a function of the initial polar angle in the weak coupling regime for different spectrum width @xmath66 .",
    "one can see that the gp approach more and more closely the unitary gp @xmath64 with the increase of @xmath66 .",
    "this accounts for once again that the gp shows more strong resilient ability to the noise of the markovian environment with a large @xmath66 .",
    "since this resilient character is obtained in weak coupling and bad - cavity condition , we argue that it is accessible by modern cavity qed experiment @xcite .",
    "we have studied exactly the gp for a qubit in an amplitude decaying environment using the kinematic approach .",
    "we have evaluated the non - markovian effect on the gp .",
    "it is demonstrated that the non - markovian environment has a more significant correction to the gp in the weak coupling regime due to the strong short - time correlation between the qubit and the environment .",
    "interestingly , our result also indicates the insensitivity of the gp to the lorentzian environment in the markovian regime when the coupling is weak .",
    "it just manifests the resilient ability of the gp to the environmental noise .",
    "this results elucidate that the gp in this cavity qed system is fault - tolerant not only against the classical noise induced by the parameter fluctuation @xcite , but also against the quantum noise .",
    "this has significant meaning in geometric quantum information processing .",
    "our model , as a basic model of quantum optics , is particularly relevant to the cavity qed experiments . in this respect",
    "some remarkable experiments , such as the efficient coupling of the trapped atoms with cavity field @xcite , have been performed successfully . practically , any phase variation is observed only via some kind of interferometry between the involved state and certain selected reference state .",
    "for example , the gp for mixed state has been observed via designing a quantum network in nmr system to realize the interferometry @xcite .",
    "this provides a clue to observe gp in cavity qed system .",
    "although the gp has not been observed in the cavity qed system , a quantum network using the recent developed microtoroidal resonator @xcite has been proposed @xcite based on the input - output process of photons @xcite .",
    "if an effective interferometry could be realized in this quantum network , then the gp would be expected to be observable in cavity qed system .",
