    "in order to shed a unique light on the problem of finite - dimensional spin glasses , we discuss the distribution of zeros of the partition function of the @xmath0 ising spin glass in the complex field plane , the lee - yang zeros @xcite .",
    "all lee - yang zeros of a ferromagnetic system are proved to lie on the imaginary axis in the complex field plane from the circle theorem @xcite .",
    "however , locations of lee - yang zeros for spin glass models in general do not obey simple rules .",
    "it is therefore interesting and important to study the distribution numerically in order to extract useful information on phase transitions in finite - dimensional spin glasses from a point of view different from conventional numerical methods like monte carlo simulations .",
    "the first study along this line was due to ozeki and nishimori @xcite . from data for relatively small systems",
    ", they found the tendency which may be consistent with the existence of the griffiths singularity @xcite .",
    "our present work is to expand their study to much larger systems and carry out quantitative evaluations of the density of zeros .    in the diluted ferromagnet ,",
    "the griffiths singularity means that the free energy is a non - analytic function of the field at the origin in the temperature range @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the critical temperature and @xmath3 is that of the corresponding non - random system .",
    "this temperature range is called the griffiths phase .",
    "this unusual phenomenon in the otherwise - paramagnetic phase is caused by rare events of bond configurations , large - size connected clusters generated with small but non - vanishing probabilities .",
    "this fact was connected with an essential singularity in the density of zeros at the origin @xcite because large clusters tend to have zeros close to the origin at temperatures below @xmath3 .",
    "the griffiths singularity in the diluted ferromagnet has also been studied through the behaviour of the inverse susceptibility analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite .    on the spin glass problem , randeria _ et al .",
    "_ studied the dynamics and suggested the existence of the griffiths phase also in the spin glass systems @xcite .",
    "there are few studies of lee - yang zeros of spin glass models in equilibrium except the work by ozeki and nishimori @xcite although there are some papers @xcite on the distribution of zeros in the complex temperature plane , fisher zeros @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we evaluate the density of lee - yang zeros of the spin glass systems by an importance - sampling monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "our results give evidence that the density of zeros has an essential singularity , which suggests the existence of the griffiths singularity in spin glasses .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we explain the exact evaluation of the partition function by numerical transfer matrix .",
    "then , we show the distribution of zeros of the @xmath0 ising model on the complex field plane in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze zeros that have direct relevance to the phase transition and compare our investigation with known characteristics of phase diagrams . in section 5 , we examine the density of zeros using the importance - sampling monte carlo algorithm which enables us to sample very rare events , and we discuss the existence of the griffiths singularity in the @xmath0 ising model .",
    "we present our conclusion in section 6 .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 ising model in an external magnetic field @xmath4 on the square and the simple cubic lattices with cylindrical boundary conditions , free in one direction and periodic in the others , which are suited for the transfer matrix method because we take the trace of spins one by one in spiral order .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes nearest neighbour pairs and @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction @xmath8 is chosen as @xmath9 or @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 . using the number of states @xmath12 for given @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the partition function",
    "is expressed in terms of a two - variable polynomial as @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( fugacity ) , @xmath17 @xmath18 is the number of sites ( assumed to be even ) , and @xmath19 is the number of bonds on the lattice .",
    "we focus on the @xmath20-dependence of @xmath21 for a fixed @xmath22 , since we are interested only in the field term for the investigation of lee - yang zeros .",
    "thus , we treat the partition function as a single - variable polynomial @xmath23 to locate lee - yang zeros for the present model , we have to evaluate the partition function for a given set of random interactions analytically and solve the equation @xmath24 for @xmath20 .",
    "there are three methods to evaluate the partition function at least partially analytically using the idea of numerical transfer matrix @xcite .",
    "the first one is to evaluate the partition function at @xmath25 different external fields @xmath26 @xmath27 by using the numerical transfer matrix method .",
    "then , we solve the set of linear equations @xmath28 @xmath27 for @xmath29 @xmath30 @xcite . in this way we know the values of all coefficients of the polynomial @xmath31 and therefore we can solve @xmath24 . in this process , since both @xmath22 and @xmath20 are treated as numbers , we have to be careful to keep very high precisions to avoid rounding errors in solving @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , this method is not very efficient because it requires a repetition of essentially the same calculations .",
    "an advantage is that the required memory size is very small and is easily parallelized on the grid computer .",
    "we use this technique for systems larger than @xmath32 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the second method , called the canonical transfer matrix , is to numerically give analytic partition functions at a fixed temperature for all values of @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this method evaluates @xmath34 ( written as @xmath35 in @xcite ) for all @xmath33 at once .",
    "the required memory size is @xmath25 times larger than in the first method , but this process is done with only one calculation .",
    "thus , the second method is faster than the previous method on a single cpu , but attention needs to be paid to the precision since we treat @xmath22 as a numerical value .    the third method is called the microcanonical transfer matrix @xcite , which evaluates perfectly exact partition functions for all values of @xmath33 and @xmath36 using symbolic manipulations on the computer .",
    "this algorithm does not involve numerical errors .",
    "however , the memory requirement is @xmath37 times larger than in the second method .    in consideration of the balance between the computational time and the required memory size",
    ", we mainly use the canonical transfer matrix method in the present work .",
    "this method accompanies rounding errors .",
    "the necessary precision depends on the ratio of the largest and the smallest coefficients , which increases very rapidly with the system size or with the temperature decrease .",
    "we have verified the reliability of this approach for the ferromagnetic ising model of sizes comparable to the spin glass system we are interested in as explained in the appendix .",
    "the system size we calculated is up to @xmath38 in two dimensions and @xmath39 in three dimensions , where the last digit is for the free boundary direction and the others are for the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we investigated at least about @xmath40 samples of random interactions for each system size .",
    "we solved the polynomial equation @xmath24 by mathematica@xmath41 by specifying the precision to appropriate values .",
    "the free energy for a system with quenched randomness is defined as the average over samples for all possible bond configurations .",
    "this implies that the partition function of a quenched system is regarded as being given by the product of partition functions of all possible configurations , @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the quenched free energy and @xmath44 denotes the set of random interactions .",
    "this fact allows us to plot zeros of all randomly - chosen samples simultaneously on the complex plane of @xmath45 .",
    "the temperature will be measured in units of @xmath46 . a schematic diagram for the distribution of zeros",

    "the value @xmath112 for the critical point @xmath102 in three dimensions may not be readily identified with a critical exponent : in the pure system it is known that the edge approaches the origin as @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "however , in the present random system , we evaluated the _ average _ location of the nearest zeros , for which we have no established scaling that relates @xmath114 with critical exponents . in two dimensions our system",
    "does not show conventional critical behaviour at @xmath108 , and the exponent @xmath115 in figure [ fig6 ] would not have direct relevance to critical exponents .",
    "it is not easy to draw a definite conclusion on the behaviour of zeros in the thermodynamic limit in three dimensions since the system size is small .",
    "nevertheless the following story is not inconsistent with our data : at @xmath116 , if the average location of zeros reaches the real axis , it is likely to be only at the origin . at low temperatures",
    ", some people may wish to interpret the data that the system - size dependence of average zeros off the imaginary axis suggests the possible stability of the spin glass phase in the external field .",
    "if the imaginary part of the average of zeros off the imaginary axis approaches @xmath47 ( triangles on the left bottom of figure [ fig7 ] ) and the real part approaches a finite value ( triangles on the right bottom ) , the spin glass phase would be stable in the external field .",
    "however , the data on the right - bottom panel of figure [ fig7 ] may instead be extrapolated to @xmath47 , rather than to a finite value , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it might imply the absence of the at line @xcite in the three dimensional @xmath0 ising model .",
    "we should anyway be very careful to draw a conclusion from the present data for small systems .",
    "in order to analyze the behaviour of zeros in a more detailed way , we study the density of zeros on the imaginary axis in two dimensions .",
    "we observe that zeros on the imaginary axis are in close proximity to the real axis in figures [ fig1 ] to [ fig5 ] .",
    "in particular we are interested in whether or not the density shows an essential singularity at the origin as an indicator of the griffiths singularity .",
    "the density of zeros on the imaginary axis will be denoted as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is defined by @xmath119 for the location of the edge , the nearest zero to the origin on the imaginary axis , of each sample . in order to compare the density of the @xmath0 model with that of the diluted ferromagnet",
    ", we also estimated the density for the bond - diluted ferromagnet with the bond probability being 1/2 at @xmath68 , which is believed to show an essential singularity at the origin @xcite .",
    "the density of nearest zeros falls very rapidly as shown in figure [ fig8 ] both for the conventional simple sampling and for the importance sampling ( to be explained now ) .",
    "since we are interested in the behaviour of @xmath117 where its value is extremely small , a special care should be taken to reduce statistical errors in the estimate of @xmath117 .",
    "in general , the evaluation of events that occur with exponentially small probabilities is very difficult if one employs a simple - sampling procedure .",
    "we therefore used the importance - sampling monte carlo algorithm as follows @xcite .     for the system size @xmath76 in the two - dimensional @xmath0 model .",
    "the open squares have been obtained by the importance sampling mc algorithm , and filled squares are by the simple sampling of @xmath120 samples . ]",
    "the basic idea is to generate bond configurations according to the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the new bond configuration @xmath121 is generated from the current configuration @xmath44 with the probability @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the location of the edge of a given bond configuration @xmath44 and @xmath124 is a guiding function .",
    "the guiding function is ideally equal to @xmath117 because equation ( [ mc ] ) then guarantees that the stationary distribution of the markov chain with equation ( [ mc ] ) becomes the inverse of the guiding function , @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , configurations with smaller @xmath117 are generated with higher probabilities .",
    "the idea is that the new bond configuration with a small probability @xmath126 is encouraged to be chosen . in order to proceed without the prior knowledge of @xmath117 , we first choose an appropriate function as @xmath126 and try an incremental improvement as follows .",
    "after an update , the nearest zero @xmath127 is calculated from the new bond configuration @xmath121 , and the histogram @xmath128 is incremented at this @xmath118 as @xmath129 .",
    "then the histogram @xmath128 will reach the stationary distribution , @xmath125 multiplied by the true distribution @xmath130 , @xmath131 thus , we can estimate @xmath130 as @xmath132 in our calculations , the new bond configuration @xmath121 is generated by flipping a single bond out of the current bond configuration @xmath44 .",
    "the initial guiding function @xmath133 is generated from the simple - sampling algorithm for about @xmath120 independent bond configurations .",
    "we repeat the above process to update @xmath134 until @xmath128 becomes nearly flat for the desired range , and finally we suppose that @xmath135 is close enough to @xmath136 .",
