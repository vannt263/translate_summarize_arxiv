    "we assume that , for each eu - eu bond , the symmetric part of the exchange tensor is diagonal and has axial symmetry in a frame linked with the eu - eu bond , i.e. it possesses two components @xmath49 and @xmath50 . since we consider the nearest neighbor intraplane and interplane integrals , we introduce the four parameters , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for each type of afm structure ( s1 and s2 ) , it is then possible to find a set of exchange integrals and d value which yields spin - flip field values closer to experiment , and susceptibility curves in reasonable qualitative agreement with the data .",
    "these parameter sets are :    1 .   for the s1 structure : @xmath51  =  0.23k , @xmath52  =  0.485k , @xmath53  =  @xmath320.125k , @xmath54  =  @xmath320.145k , and d  =  @xmath320.06k , 2 .   for the s2 structure",

    "the m(h ) and @xmath8(t ) curves are the same for both sets ; the afm transition temperature is t@xmath2  =  14k and the paramagnetic curie temperatures are @xmath12[100 ] = @xmath12[110 ] = 2.2k and @xmath18[001]=5.1k .",

    "[ chi_vs_t_low_temp_all_directions ] and [ fig_m_vs_h_1p8k_all_directions ] . for the s1 structure , with the introduction of exchange anisotropy ,",
    "one recovers a smaller , hence more physical , @xmath55 value .",
    "the calculated values for @xmath16 and for the @xmath12 s are rather close to the experimental values , particularly for @xmath17  [ 001 ] .",
    "the larger value of @xmath12[001 ] is an effect of the anisotropy and it is reflected in the larger value of @xmath8(t@xmath23 ) for this field direction .",

    "m_(h ) along [ 001 ] since the easy axis in both s1 and s2 structures is the c axis .",
    "this suggests that the zero field structure is a `` canted '' structure , i.e. it possesses a spin component in the ( ab ) plane , and one must find mechanisms able to induce such a deviation from the easy axis .",
    "this is the subject of discussion in the next section .",
    "one can readily think of two mechanisms leading to a magnetic structure canted off the c axis .",
    "the first one is a crystallographic distortion that would occur in the afm phase , such that the eu site no longer has fourfold point symmetry .",
    "this would imply a loss of the isotropy of the magnetic properties in the ( ab ) plane , which contradicts observations since the magnetization and susceptibilty along [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] are identical .",
    "so a low temperature symmetry breaking distortion can be discarded .",
    "the second mechanism is the presence of an asymmetric term of the exchange tensor , namely the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction .",
    "it can be seen to be non - zero for the two exchange paths considered here since none of the mid points of the intraplane and interplane exchange bonds is an inversion center for the crystal structure of eunige@xmath0 . considering only nearest neighbour exchange , i.e. intraplane exchange , application of the moriya rules",
    "@xcite shows that the associated dzyaloshinski - moriya vector d@xmath56 lies in the ( ab ) plane and is perpendicular to the eu - eu bond .",
    "this can lead to a canted zero field magnetic structure .",
    "however , in order to test this hypothesis , a more sophisticated sublattice decomposition is needed , because convergence can not be reached in our present in - field calculation in the presence of asymmetric exchange .",
    "this suggests that the 4 sublattices used here are not adequate to reproduce the actual magnetic structure and its evolution with the field , and one must await the determination of the magnetic structure of eunige@xmath0 to check for the presence and magnitude of the dzyaloshinski - moriya exchange .",
    "one can also note that the absence of mirror symmetry with respect to the ( ab ) plane implies that there should be two different interplane nearest neighbour exchange integrals @xmath57 and @xmath58 , according to the upper or lower position of the eu - eu bond with respect to the ( ab ) plane .",
    "this asymmetry is a priori not expected to lead to a transverse spin component since it does not break the fourfold symmetry around the c axis . with our present definition of the 4 sublattices , which are invariant by a translation of vector c , introduction of these different integrals amounts to replacing @xmath41 by (@xmath57 + @xmath58 ) and therefore this kind of asymmetry is not relevant within our model .",
    "finally , an anisotropic magnetic behavior has also been observed in euptsi@xmath0  @xcite and , for the case of the other s - state ion gd@xmath59 , in several intermetallics : gdru@xmath14t@xmath14 ( t  =  ge or si ) ,  @xcite gd@xmath14pdsi@xmath0  @xcite and gd@xmath60ge@xmath61 ,  @xcite where a metamagnetic behavior of the magnetization is reported along some particular direction .",
    "this behavior was attributed in these works to exchange anisotropy .",
    "as a conclusion , single crystals of the intermetallic material eunige@xmath0 have been synthesized and studied with a variety of techniques : magnetization , specific heat , transport and mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "eunige@xmath0 contains divalent eu , its nel temperature is found to be t@xmath2  =  13.2k , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "the mssbauer spectra show that there occurs a cascade of transitions , as often observed in intermetallic eu materials , from paramagnetic to incommensurate afm to commensurate afm as temperature decreases .",
    "the magnetization and magnetoresistance in the afm phase are found to be strongly anisotropic , which is a priori surprising for a spin only ion like eu@xmath13 . in particular , the magnetization along the c axis at 2k shows an unusual staircase - like behavior . with the aim of obtaining the exchange integrals in eunige@xmath0",
    ", we applied a model with anisotropic exchange and dipole - dipole interactions which reproduces the main features of the magnetization and susceptibility curves .",
    "however , we could not reach a fully satisfying reproduction of the magnetization curves along c , which suggests that the magnetic structure is more complex than the afm collinear arrangement assumed in our model . to go further",
    ", one must await the determination of the magnetic structure by neutron diffraction .",
    "we emphasize that the dipole - dipole interaction must be taken into account for a full understanding of the magnetic structure and its evolution with the applied field in eu intermetallics .",
    "we show here that it is important to take into account the dipole - dipole interaction in computing the single crystal magnetization curves . indeed , eu@xmath13 has a rather large saturated moment ( 7@xmath62 ) , and the dipolar field is of the order of 0.05 t .",
    "this value is small with respect to the characteristic exchange fields in eunige@xmath0 ( a few t ) , but it is of the same magnitude as the anisotropy field in eu@xmath13 compounds .",
    "therefore , it must be taken into account for determining both the zero field magnetic structure , since it can compete with the crystalline anisotropy in defining the easy magnetic axis , and the low field magnetization since it plays a role in defining the spin - flop field .    in order to obtain the dipolar field on a given eu@xmath13 ion on a given sublattice",
    ", we use the ewald summation method to compute the infinite lattice sums @xcite , and we write the dipolar field acting on an ion in the @xmath63 sublattice as : @xmath64 where the @xmath65 matrices contain lattice sums . for instance , the self - sublattice matrix @xmath66 is diagonal and writes , in units of the lorentz field parameter h@xmath67  =  @xmath68 , where @xmath69  =  2__a__@xmath70c is the volume of the primitive cell , and _ a _",

    "@xmath22  0 , in the absence of dipolar field , the eu moments lie along the _ c _ axis . however , when taking into account the dipolar field , the eu moments lie in the _ ab_-plane until d reaches the rather large value @xmath320.23k , and there is no spin - flop for @xmath17  [ 001 ] . for d  @xmath22  @xmath320.23k ,",
    "the easy c axis is recovered and a spin - flop occurs for @xmath17  [ 001 ] , and as @xmath55 increases the spin - flop field increases . as an illustration of the importance of the dipole - dipole interaction for the calculation of the magnetization curves , we have represented in fig .  [ fig_m_in_presence_and_absence_of_dipolar_field ] the m(h ) curves for the s1 magnetic structure without and with the dipolar field with the same ( probably unphysically large ) value of the d parameter  :  d  =  @xmath320.32k . in this case ,",
    "introduction of the dipolar field has the effect of decreasing the spin - flop field , which in turns affects the value of the spin - flip field for @xmath17  [ 001 ] . with this example ,",
    "we want to show that the dipolar field should be taken into account for any realistic calculation of the single crystal magnetization in eu compounds , especially when the ordering temperature is not too high , i.e. the exchange fields are not too large with respect to the dipolar field ( @xmath74  0.05 t ) .",
    "we consider a simple implementation of anisotropy of the exchange interaction , by considering that the exchange tensor j@xmath75 has axial symmetry in a frame where the eu - eu bond is taken as the _",
    "z_-axis , i.e. it has a longitudinal component j@xmath76 and two identical transverse components j@xmath77 .",
    "then , for each considered exchange bond @xmath78 ( intraplane or interplane ) , the exchange hamiltonian writes , in a frame linked with the eu - eu bond : @xmath79 for instance , considering the intraplane exchange bond between sublattice 1 and 2 along a ( see fig .  [ fig_decomposition_into_sublattices ] )",
    ", the frame oxyz linked to this bond is taken as : z  @xmath80  a , x  @xmath80  c and y  @xmath80  -b .",
    "the diagonal axial exchange tensor with components @xmath81 and @xmath82 is then transformed into the ( abc ) frame and , taking into account 4 such intraplane bonds , one obtains the total intraplane exchange matrix between sublattices 1 and 2 , or 3 and 4 , to which one can add an antisymmetric dzyaloshinski - moriya term with vector * * d**@xmath56 which lies in the _",
