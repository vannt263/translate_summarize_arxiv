    "with the current advances of relativistic heavy ion collision(rhic ) physics , there is a growing interest in discussing the self - organizing nature of relativistic quantum field theory(rqft ) .",
    "the phase transition and the spontaneous symmetry breaking anticipated to be observed in the rhic facilities are the paramount examples of the physical phenomena due to the self - organization of quantum fields . since these novel phenomena can not be easily predicted in the ordinary perturbation series , they form highly nontrivial examples that ought to be analyzed by various nonperturbative methods available for the rqfts .",
    "although the problem of quantization of interacting fields is not yet completely solved , it appears that the duality existing in the rqfts is the key to handle the strong interaction theories . according to the duality",
    ", the original particle theory of strong couplings may be equivalent to the quasi - particle theory of weak couplings . as the interactions get stronger , the associate quantum fluctuations get larger and consequently the formation of a nontrivial vacuum often accompanied by the condensation of fields may be energetically more favorable than the adherence to an original trivial vacuum without any condensation .",
    "the particles moving in the ambient nontrivial vacuum condensates may be described by the quasi - particles which carry different masses compare to their original masses defined in the trivial vacuum .",
    "then , the couplings among the quasi - particles may become weak as the couplings among the original particles grow strong .",
    "when such duality works self - consistently within the rqft , one may be able to solve the corresponding strong interaction problem utilizing the weak coupling developed for the quasi - particles .",
    "for the phenomena involving only weak interactions , the perturbation theory may provide systematic predictions and even some physical insight how the interaction can affect the properties of the system .",
    "thus , the duality allows us to convert the original nonperturbative problem into the quasiparticle perturbative problem .",
    "however , the key issue here is to check if the rqfts indeed have the self - organizing characteristics that lead to the duality within themselves . to investigate such nontrivial characteristics",
    ", one can not just rely on the perturbation series from the beginning but need to develop a nonperurbative method which may be useful to analyze the self - organizing nature of the rqfts .",
    "in this work , we discuss such a nonperturbative method that appears to be much simpler than other rather well - known methods such as the hartree approximation ( ha ) and the gaussian effective potential ( gep ) method . following the nomenclature in the literature",
    "we call this method as the oscillation representation ( or ) method , although in our view all of these nonperturbative methods ( or , gep , ha ) stem from the same principle of quantum effective action approach@xcite .",
    "the or method was explicitly formulated by efimov@xcite and was , in fact , used earlier by chang @xcite and magruder @xcite , though in some indirect way .",
    "the method is at length described in a monograph @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the or method is to redefine the mass of interacting field relative to the free one and simultaneously introduce a shift of the field quantization point leading to a nonzero value of its vacuum condensate .",
    "this effect is realized in the nature represented by a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism and thus one can expect that it may be a general feature of quantum field systems with interactions .",
    "however , the or method has not been utilized as extensively as the methods of gep@xcite and ha@xcite . even in the 1 + 1 dimensional scalar field theory such as the one we present in this work , not much of the or results distinguished from the gep or ha",
    "results have been known or discussed to the best of our knowledge .",
    "although the or results for the @xmath0 theory were presented in ref.@xcite , the distinction between the or and gep ( or ha ) results for this simple model was not pointed out at length .",
    "thus , for the present work , we analyze the details of the distinction in this most simple case first and extend the application to the @xmath1 theory : @xmath3 where the results from the variational method of the gep have also been studied @xcite .",
    "the gep is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian density corresponding to eq.([lagrangian ] ) . here , @xmath6 is the mass parameter and @xmath7 is a normalized gaussian wave functional centered on @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath9 as we will discuss the details in the next two sections ( sections ii and iii ) , the gep method can in principle give the two or equations that we solve simultaneously in this work .",
    "one of them is known as the @xmath10 equation in the gep,_i.e .",
    "_ @xmath11 at @xmath12 , and the other or equation is equivalent to @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the gep method , these two equations are not solved simultaneously in practice .",
    "it turns out that the quasiparticle mass defined by @xmath14 in the gep is not same with @xmath10 which is the simultaneous solution of the quasiparticle mass from the two or equations . in this paper , we therefore pay more attention to the distinct aspects of the or results compared to the gep and ha results and discuss the property of the or results which was not mentioned in the more great detail before .    formally , the or is settled by requiring that the hamiltonian operator should be written in terms of creation and annihilation operators of an oscillator basis with an appropriate frequency and in the correct form defined by + ( 1 ) all field operators in the total hamiltonian @xmath15 are written in the normal ordered product , + ( 2 ) the hamiltonian @xmath16 is quadratic over the field operators , + ( 3 ) the interaction hamiltonian @xmath17 contains field operators in powers more than two .",
    "+ using this method with the cannonical transformation of quantum fields , one may allow to build a standard perturbation theory for the quasiparticles in the region of the coupling constants where the original theory is nonperturbative .",
    "thus , we utilize the or method to transform the original theory which is intrinsically nonperturbative to the equivalent theory of the quasiparticle representation that can be solved rather easily by the perturbation method .    as we will discuss , the exact or results include several vacuum solutions yielding different mass values of the quantum field for fixed values of coupling constants . among those multiple solutions ,",
    "however , it is certainly not difficult to select the non - trivial solutions that are physically meaningful because of the duality consideration . in this work",
    ", we will thus focus only those duality - related solutions which are not hindered from the physical interpretation .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the or method generates also the solutions that can not be interpreted as straightforward as the ones we focus in this paper .",
    "in particular , we find a class of solution that does nt exhibit the anticipated duality property and another class of solution that we call spurious in the sense that it yields the pure imaginary value for the vacuum condensation .",
    "we do not yet know all the physical meaning of these classes of solutions , but the generation of multiple solutions are expected because the or equations are the nonlinear algebraic equations relating the quasiparticle mass and the field condensation with the parameter of coupling constant as we will present in details for the rest of the paper .    in section",
    "ii , we present more details of the or method using the @xmath18 theory which can be easily deduced from the lagrangian density of @xmath19 theory by taking @xmath20 .",
    "we compare the or results with the results obtained by the other available methods such as the gep and the ha as well as the available lattice result . in section iii ,",
    "we apply the or method to the @xmath1 theory and discuss the effects from the presence of @xmath19 interaction to the duality - related vacuum solutions .",
    "we analyze the quasiparticle mass and the energy density in the entire domain of coupling parameter space and present the classical potential for the nontrivial solutions .",
    "we discuss two physically meaningful duality - related quasiparticle solutions with different symmetry properties and show that they however generate the identical effective potential in the strong coupling limit of the original theory .",
    "summary and conclusions follow in section iv . in the appendix",
    "a , we briefly summarize some details of the ha in the @xmath0 theory and discuss an equivalence between the two nontrivial vacuum solutions in this approximation . in the appendix b",
    ", we present a proof of unitary inequivalence between the bifurcated nontrivial solutions from the or method in the infinite volume limit .",
    "in the appendix c , we summarize the results of the spurious solutions with some discussion .",
    "the usual recipe to produce a quantum system comes from the correspondence principle .",
    "namely , a quantum system can be obtained from its classical analog by assuming that the field is not a @xmath21-number but an operator satisfying relevant commutation relations .",
    "the oscillator representation method is a generalization of this scheme . to start with ,",
    "let us consider the @xmath18 theory as a simple example .",
    "the hamiltonian density of the classical field is given by @xmath22 to plug the quantum physics in , we postulate that the field @xmath23 and the corresponding conjugate momentum @xmath24 are operators which satisfy canonical equal time commutation relations @xmath25_{x_0=y_0}=",

    "= \\delta({\\bf k } -{\\bf k ' } ) , \\nonumber \\\\ { [ } a_m({\\bf k}),a_m({\\bf k ' } ) ] = [ a_m^+({\\bf k}),a_m^+({\\bf k ' } ) ] = 0 .",

    "@xmath33 are not already eigenstates of the full hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of small interaction strength , the free representation of field operators can be a good starting point to develop a perturbation theory .",
    "the hamiltonian density operator is then written as @xmath35    now , we use the canonical transformation of the field operators to build the quasiparticle representation of the same hamiltonian .",
    "we consider the essential point of the reparameterizations , _",
    "i.e. _ the change of mass , which can affect the choice of representation for the free field quantization . for the free field operators ,",
    "the change of mass @xmath36 of particles is described by the bogoliubov - valatin transformation : @xmath37 here , the free field operators with mass @xmath38 are expressed in terms of the field operators with mass @xmath30 .",
    "a consequence of the ambiguity of the mass definition due to interactions comes from the ambiguity in the choice of the initial representation of the interacting field .",
    "this was emphasized in coleman s paper @xcite .",
    "he also proposed a useful technique on how to redefine a normal ordered product of any number of field operators with respect to a new value of mass in the case of ( 1 + 1 ) scalar field theory .",
    "the redefinition after the mass change is given by the formulas @xcite : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some arbitrary @xmath21-number , @xmath42(@xmath43 ) stands for the normal ordering of an operator with respect to the initial mass @xmath30 ( the new mass @xmath38 ) , @xmath44 is the free quantum field defined by eq.([fieldop ] ) and @xmath45 is the quantum field of independent quasi - particles for which the representation given by eq.([fieldop ] ) is valid after changing @xmath36 . the correspondence between the canonical transformation and the renormalization group equation is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the expression ( [ normexp ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath46}_{j=0 } \\bigl ( \\frac{1}{8\\pi } \\ln(\\frac{m^2}{m^2 } ) \\bigr ) ^j\\frac{(-1)^j}{j!(n-2j)!}n_m(\\phi^{n-2j}_m ) , \\label{normord}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath48 .",
    "the most simple illustration of nontrivial solutions in this case is the 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath18 theory . rewriting the hamiltonian ( [ quantham ] ) in terms of the quasi - particles using coleman s formula of normal ordering rearrangement",
    ", one gets @xmath49 where @xmath50 .    for a consistent description of the dynamics in terms of the quasi - particles one should provide the right form of the hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e. _ the free part should correspond to that of the field with mass @xmath38 and the interacting part should contain only terms with powers of @xmath45 larger than 2 @xcite . as it can be seen , the expression ( [ phim ] ) itself can not provide this requirement for the field with mass other than @xmath30 .",
    "revising just the mass does not lead to a nontrivial solution and thus an additional transformation is obviously required .",
    "the latter can be done by shifting the quantization point of the field , which makes the quanta of the field to be produced around some vacuum expectation value @xmath51 .",
    "thus , let us now change the field variable from @xmath52 to @xmath53 for the inclusion of the field condensation denoted by @xmath54:_i.e .",
    "_ , @xmath55 then the hamiltonian density is written as @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the right form of hamiltonian density for the field with mass @xmath38 , @xmath58 @xmath59 is the energy density of the vacuum for the quasiparticle of mass @xmath38 up to the zeroth order of the dimensionless effective coupling @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a remainder . to have the hamiltonian in the right form the remainder must be equal to 0",
    "therefore , we have two equations of two variables , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as follows : @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dimensionless coupling of the initial theory ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath68 .",
    "we note here the correspondence to the gep discussed in section i. the energy density @xmath59 given by eq.([energy ] ) corresponds to @xmath69 presented in eq.([gep ] ) . minimizing @xmath69 ( or @xmath59 ) with respect to @xmath6 ( or @xmath63 )",
    ", one gets the gep given by eq.([gep ] ) with the so - called @xmath10 equation which is identical to eq.([or1 ] ) that is one of the or equations . the other or equation , eq.([or2 ] ) , can be obtained by making the total ( not partial ) derivative of the gep ( _ i.e. _ , eq.(4.11 ) of ref.@xcite or eq.(2.16b ) of ref.@xcite ) with respect to the condensation @xmath70 and setting it to zero , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath13 .",
    "one should note , however , that the gep is a function of the global field condensate @xmath71 not the local field @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the gep is not a part of interaction hamiltonian describing the field dynamics . in our work , instead of using the gep , we will directly use the interaction hamiltonian and the corresponding classical potential ( see _ e.g. _ eq.([vclass ] ) ) .",
    "the or equations ( eqs.([or1 ] ) and ( [ or2 ] ) ) have three solutions and one of them is trivial : @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the two nontrivial mass solutions are shown in fig.1 as solid and dashed lines .",
    "the dashed line solution on fig.1 becomes similar to the trivial one when the dimensionless coupling becomes large : @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "however , the solid line solution from fig.1 is what we are interested in because it fulfills the duality . for this case ,",
    "@xmath77 , @xmath78 . as one can see in this solution , when the dimensionless coupling @xmath67 of the initial theory becomes large , the dimensionless couplings of the quasiparticle theory , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , get small@xcite : @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the quasiparticle theory becomes perturbative when the initial coupling @xmath67 gets very strong .",
    "the physical mass in this regime is close to @xmath83 , and the corrections are in the order of @xmath84 . in this way",
    ", we can see the duality between the initial nonperturbative theory of unbroken @xmath85 symmetry with a large dimensionless coupling @xmath67 and the quasiparticle theory of broken @xmath2 symmetry with small couplings @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this duality is exact because the canonical transformation leaves the hamiltonian intact but changes only its representation in terms of the quasiparticle field variable @xmath53 .",
    "as we discussed earlier , the multiple solutions are not unexpected because the or equations , eqs.([or1 ] ) and ( [ or2 ] ) , are algebraically nonlinear .",
    "however , it can be shown ( see appendix b ) that the two vacua associated with different values of @xmath63 or @xmath64 are unitarily inequivalent in the infinite volume limit . thus , the two nontrivial solutions are not connected to each other .",
    "the bifurcation of quasi - particle masses appear above the coupling @xmath88 .",
    "however , the correct critical coupling of the phase transition should be determined from the comparison of the energy density between the trivial and condensed vacua . in fig.2 , we present the energy density of the nontrivial solutions and find that the condensed vacuum energy density of the duality - related solution gets lower than the trivial vacuum energy density only above @xmath89 .",
    "this value @xmath89 coincides with the critical coupling constant obtained by the gep method since our energy density given by eq.([energy ] ) is equal to the gep at the minimum .",
    "this value is remarkably close to the critical coupling constant ( 10.24(3 ) ) obtained by the lattice calculation@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we note that our or result does nt take into account the the higher order corrections in the quasiparticle effective coupling @xmath60 and obtain the first order phase transition instead of the second order phase transition which may be more accurate description of the phase transition in @xmath0 theory @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we thus focus only on the region where the original coupling is much larger than the critical coupling so that the perturbative calculation in terms of quasiparticle degrees of freedom is allowed .",
    "although there is a coincidence of the critical coupling , it is not clear if the values of quasi - particle masses defined in the gep , ha and or methods also coincide . in the gep approach",
    ", it seems only natural to define the quasiparticle mass as the second derivative of the gep , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath90 . as discussed earlier , in the gep approach a variational method",
    "is taken to minimize the gep satisfying just eq.([or1 ] ) . confirming the well - known equivalence between the gep method and the ha for the ground - state energy @xcite , the gep result using this definition of quasiparticle mass , _",
    "i.e. _ the second derivative of the gep , indeed agrees precisely with the hartree results ( squares and circles in fig.[geff ] ) and @xmath91 in his notations ) .",
    "nevertheless , the two type of solutions lead in fact to the same physical results as shown in fig.[geff ] . for more details , see the appendix a. ] .",
    "however , one should note that the second derivative of the gep at the minimum @xmath92 does not yield the mass @xmath38 of the quasi - particle precisely but somewhat modified value @xmath93 ; _",
    "i.e. _ with the notations used in eq.(4.11 ) of ref.@xcite , the second derivative of the gep , @xmath94 , is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath92 in our notations .",
    "removing @xmath98 in eqs.([or1 ] ) and ( [ or2 ] ) , one can immediately get @xmath99 identical to @xmath100 .",
    "this is the reason why the gep result given by eq.([gepdd ] ) shown by dotted line in fig.[geff ] does nt coincide either of the bifurcated or solutions ( solid and dashed lines ) . of course",
    ", if both the @xmath10 equation and the gep minimum condition @xmath101 are solved simultaneously to determine @xmath10 , then it is identical to the or method and the value of @xmath10 coincides with the quasiparticle mass @xmath38 defined in the or method .",
    "however , we note once again that the gep and ha methods are quite different from the or procedure because the gep and ha methods rely on the variational procedure while the or method is explicitly solving both eqs.([or1 ] ) and ( [ or2 ] ) simultaneously .",
    "as we have already discussed , the solid line in fig.[geff ] exhibits a duality between the theory with mass @xmath30 based on the trivial vacuum @xmath74 and the theory with mass @xmath38 based on the nontrivial vacuum @xmath102 .",
    "namely , a strong coupling theory with mass @xmath30 is identical to a weak coupling theory with mass @xmath38 . a similar observation of duality can be found in the solutions obtained by gep and ha ( see also appendix a ) , although the quasiparticle masses defined in the gep and ha approaches do not coincide with the quasiparticle mass defined in the or method .",
    "we also note that the gep result ( dotted line ) approaches to the or result given by the solid line in the limit @xmath103 since the terms of @xmath104 overwhelm the terms of @xmath105 in eq.([gepdd ] ) for that limit .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the method of bogoliubov - valatin transformations gives the same results as the gep .",
    "in fact all of the nonperturbative methods that we discuss in this work,_i.e . _ or , gep and ha , can be described formally in terms of bogoliubov - valatin transformations because all of them use only the change of particle mass and the field shift to get the new representation of the field variables . however , these transformations contain parameters ( mass ratio and the value of the shift ) which can not be determined from the transformations themselves .",
    "to fix the parameters , some additional requirement is necessary .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite used essentially the same variational requirement as the gep and therefore it is very natural that they found the same results as the gep . on the other hand , in the or method",
    ", we are not using the gep at all but relying on the form of the hamiltonian described in section i.    applying the correspondence principle to the hamiltonian ( [ phi4ham ] ) , we now consider the classical potential given by @xmath106 which is written here in terms of the classical field corresponding to the initial , unshifted field @xmath45 .",
    "as it can be easily seen , the potential has extremum at @xmath107 .",
    "this is provided by the demand not to have terms in hamiltonian which are linear in @xmath108 .",
    "the double derivative in this point is larger than 0 and equal to @xmath109 , _",
    "i.e. _ the classical potential has minimum at @xmath107 and the mass corresponding to oscillations around the minimum is precisely @xmath38 .",
    "that is why the or method provides self - consistent procedure of quantization of interacting fields and interpretation of the solutions as particle excitations is valid .",
    "( in contrast , @xmath110 for the gep as shown in eq.([gepdd ] ) . )",
    "in addition , one can easily prove the symmetry of @xmath111 under the exchange of @xmath112 and @xmath113,_i.e._@xmath114 , utilizing the or equations ( eqs.([or1 ] ) and ( [ or2 ] ) ) .    in fig.[g4new",
    "] , the effective potential @xmath111 given by eq.([vclass ] ) is presented .",
    "as one can see in fig.[g4new ] , the bifurcated solutions for @xmath115 indeed generate two effective potentials ( i , ii ) at a given coupling @xmath67 , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath116 10 or 12 .",
    "both potentials ( i and ii ) in fig.[g4new ] have clear minima and the second derivative at each minimum generates the corresponding quasi - particle mass @xmath38 precisely .",
    "the growth of bifurcation is also evident from the comparison of the potentials i and ii for @xmath116 10 and 12 .",
    "we note however that only the potential i provides the physically meaningful duality - related solution and the potential ii does nt satisfy the duality that we discuss in this work .",
    "an analysis of realistic models using the oscillator representation method is more complicate ( see , for example , discussion for 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath18 theory in @xcite ) due to substantial sophistication of the renormalization procedure .",
    "even the simple models however were not fully studied in the framework of or method . as presented in this section , the comparison of the or predictions with the gep and",
    "hartree results has been done for 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath18 theory @xcite . in higher dimensions , the variational methods such as the gep and",
    "ha may have a rather fundamental difficulty .",
    "the reason of this problem originates from the error estimates of the approximation in the gep and hartree methods .",
    "for instance , the ha replaces the interaction term @xmath117 for @xmath118 by the kinetic term @xmath119 .",
    "the task of getting the better approximation is to minimize the positively defined measure @xmath120 .",
    "nevertheless , the vacuum expectation value of the operator @xmath121 is not positively defined .",
    "thus , it is necessary to calculate the vacuum expectation value for its square that is always positive . in that case , even if the interaction term itself is renormalizable , its square may be not ( in particular , for @xmath122 ) .",
    "that is why in higher dimensions the gep and hartree methods come across a renormalization problem in computing their error measures@xcite .",
    "more discussion about the difficulty in the gep method for the higher dimension can be found in ref.@xcite . however , this is not the case for the or method , since it does not use any variational procedure .",
    "therefore , among the three ( or , gep , hartree ) , the or method seems to be most attractive .",
    "the reasons may be summarized as follows : + i ) the problems of renormalization in higher dimensions are technical , but not principal .",
    "+ ii ) the hamiltonian is identically rewritten via canonical transformation and consequently the transformed hamiltonian keeps the identical information as the original hamiltonian .",
    "+ iii ) the second derivative of effective potential gives the quasi - particle mass precisely in the or , while the others give somewhat modified values .",
    "using the or method , we now compute the parameters of different phases for the scalar field theory with both @xmath18 and @xmath19 interactions .",
    "the starting classical hamiltonian density is @xmath123 the way to proceed is the same as in the case of @xmath18 theory . using the formulas ( [ normfree ] ) and ( [ normexp ] ) and shifting the quantization point",

    "the requirement to have the hamiltonian in the right form means that the remainder @xmath126 is equal to zero .",

    "the most interesting feature of the @xmath19 theory is the appearence of the two apparently different quasiparticle perturbation theories ( see the upper branches of figs .",
    "[ phasesnew1 ] and [ phasesnew2 ] ) which represent the initial nonperturbative theory .",
    "the first one corresponds to the symmetric phase with the dimensionless quasiparticle couplings given by eq.([pertunbr ] ) and the second one corresponds to the broken - symmetry phase with the dimensionless couplings given by eq.([pertbr ] ) .",
    "the subscripts `` s '' and `` bs '' of the coupling @xmath147 and the mass @xmath38 represent the correspondence to the symmetric and broken - symmetry phases , respectively .",
    "the two quasiparticle theories ( _ i.e. _ @xmath148 s and @xmath149 s ) differ from each other significantly in the sence that one of them ( @xmath148 s ) preserves the @xmath150 symmetry of the initial hamiltonian ( [ clasphi6 ] ) upon changing @xmath151 , while the other ( @xmath149 s ) does not respect the @xmath151 symmetry . physically , this means that in the theory of symmetric phase with the @xmath148 couplings the processes involving odd number of particles are not allowed while they are allowed in the broken - symmetry theory with @xmath149 couplings .",
    "this is because in the theory of symmetric phase , the hamiltonian depends on the even powers of @xmath152 ( to provide @xmath153 symmetry ) and thus the s - matrix contains only the even number of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "however , one may wonder if these two apparently different quasiparticle theories are in fact equivalent to each other describing the same physics with just different degrees of freedom . in this respect ,",
    "we notice that the two different quasiparticle theories give the same effective potential in the limit of very large @xmath67 and @xmath141 . in figs.[effpot1],[effpot2 ] and [ effpot3 ]",
    "we show the classical potentials which correspond to the two quasiparticle theories at different values of the coupling @xmath142 .",
    "as it can be seen , when the quasiparticle coupling @xmath142 becomes small ( _ i.e. _ @xmath141 becomes very large ) , the relative difference between the two quasiparticle potentials diminishes substantially .",
    "we verified that the two classical potentials are indeed identical to each other in the @xmath154 limit .    in the gep approach @xcite , it was also recognized that there are three solutions of symmetric phase ( one of them is the trivial solution and two others are the nontrivial solutions corresponding to the ones that we showed in fig.[phasesnew1 ] ) .",
    "as we consider only one of the two nontrivial solutions ( the upper branch in fig.[phasesnew1 ] ) as the physically relevant ( duality - related ) solution , the gep approach also dealt with only one ( physically relevant ) solution among the two nontrivial solutions . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown that the form of @xmath155 equation of the gep approach is invariant under the exchange of @xmath30 and @xmath156 with an appropriate redefinition of effective couplings @xmath157 and @xmath158 , as well as @xmath159 , where @xmath160 satisfies the constraint equation given by eq.([equ2 ] ) : @xmath161 ( note @xmath162 for the symmetric phase ) .",
    "indeed , we can show the form invariance of both or eqs .",
    "( [ equ1 ] ) and ( [ equ2 ] ) under the same transformations .    observing such form invariance",
    ", it was argued in the gep approach @xcite that the nontrivial symmetric phase solution is just a duplication of the trivial solution and thus should be avoided . however , as we discussed above , the duality between the trivial and nontrivial symmetric phase solutions provides the physical meaning to the form invariance of the or equations .",
    "because of the duality , we see the utility of both trivial and nontrivial solutions in the symmetric phase .",
    "while the trivial solution can be utilized for the perturbation theory at small @xmath67 and @xmath141 , the nontrivial symmetric phase solution can be used for the construction of quasiparticle perturbation theory in the regime of very large @xmath67 and @xmath141 .",
    "furthemore , since there exists also a duality between the trivial solution and the nontrivial broken - symmetry solution we can rather easily understand the equivalence of the classical effective potentials between the symmetric phase and the broken - symmetry phase for the very large couplings of the original theory ( see fig.[effpot3 ] ) . in the limit of @xmath154 ( which means also @xmath149s@xmath163 , as shown in fig.[couplings ] ) , the higher order corrections get negligible and thus the equivalence of the classical potentials between the symmetric and broken - symmetry phases is revealed manifestly as shown in fig.[effpot3 ] .",
    "the formation of quasiparticle in rqft may be a good example of self - organizing nature in the nonperturbative strong interactions .",
    "this nature is realized by altering the vacuum structure and lowering the vacuum energy density as the strength of the interactions gets more enhanced . our main goal in this paper was to provide the explicit examples that reveal such nature of self - organizing rqft and show the utility of duality generated by the canonical transformation in solving the nonperturbative strong interaction problem . for the explicit but simple examples , we analized of 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath18 and @xmath19 theories .",
    "our purpose was fulfilled by applying the or method which is a generalization of the canonical quantization scheme .",
    "the or method uses canonical commutation relations for the free field operators and employs the canonical transformation of quantum fields represented by the change of the field mass and the condensation of the field . the idea to demand the right form of the hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e. _ excluding the terms linear in @xmath152 and taking the coefficient of @xmath164 as @xmath165 guarantees that the classical potential has the minimum at the quantization point @xmath107 and that the double derivative of the classical potential at this point is given by @xmath109 .",
    "this assures that the or method gives a self - consistent procedure of quantization and a valid description of the field excitations around the minimum point in terms of quasiparticles .",
    "in contrast to the gep and ha methods , the or method is not based on the variational procedure so that it does not have a bottleneck of renormalization problem in higher dimensions as discussed in section ii .",
    "however , the or method has not been utilized as extensively as the gep and ha methods . even in the 1 + 1 dimensional scalar field theory ,",
    "not much of the or results were contrasted from the gep and ha results although the or results for the @xmath0 theory were presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "we attempted to fill such gap in this work .    for the fixed classical hamiltonian and renormalization procedure ( fixed by the counter - terms ) ,",
    "it is natural to expect that the or method yields several different solutions for the quasiparticle mass and condensation because the or equations are in general nonlinear .",
    "however , the unitary inequivalence arising from these different or vacuum solutions prohibits the transitions among the quasiparticles with different mass and/or condensation .",
    "although some of the solutions correspond to the heavier quasiparticles , they do not decay into the light ones due to the unitary inequivalence ; _ i.e. _ each sort of the quasiparticles is stable within the or .",
    "the unitary inequivalence between the or solutions is shown in appendix b. a recent application of the unitary inequivalence to the flavor mixing phenomena can be found in ref.@xcite . in this work",
    ", we selected only the duality - related or solutions because they can provide the immediate physical interpretation .",
    "the reason why the physical interpretation is immediate for the duality - related solutions is because the strong coupling particle theory becomes solvable once it is transformed into an exactly equivalent quasiparticle theory with weak couplings .    using the @xmath0 theory ,",
    "we compared the or results with the results obtained by gep and ha . in ref.@xcite , it was discussed that the value of the critical coupling @xmath166 obtained by the or method coincides with the one obtained by the gep method .",
    "we also note that this value of the critical coupling agrees remarkably well with the lattice result @xcite . due to the equivalence between the ha and gep methods for the ground state energy @xcite the agreement of the critical couplings between",
    "the or and ha methods follows as well .",
    "although the critical values of coupling constant @xmath67 turned out to be same for all three methods ( or , gep , ha ) , the or method gives the quantitatively different dependence of the nontrivial field mass on the effective coupling constant , compare to the gep and ha results ( see fig.[geff ] and the discussions in section ii ) .",
    "we have extended the application to the 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath19 theory and compared the results of or method with what was already obtained by the gep .",
    "we found that the different solutions for the mass of quasi - particles between the or and the gep are sustained . in the or analysis of @xmath1 theory we found two physically meaningful duality - related solutions ( upper sheets of figs.[phasesnew1 ] and [ phasesnew2 ] ) , one in the symmetric phase and the other in the broken - symmetry phase .",
    "although these two solutions have apparently different symmetry property , we find that their effective potentials do agree in the limit of very large couplings @xmath67 and @xmath141 of the initial theory , _",

    "<S> we investigate the self - organizing nature of relativistic quantum field theory in terms of canonical transformation and duality presenting simple but explicit examples of @xmath0 and @xmath1 theories . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose is fulfilled by applying the oscillator representation ( or ) method which allows us to convert the original strong interaction theory into a weekly interacting quasiparticle theory that is equivalent to the original theory . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss advantages of the or method and compare the results with what was already obtained by the method of gaussian effective potential ( gep ) and the hartree approximation ( ha ) . </S>",
    "<S> while we confirm that the gep results are identical to the hartree results for the ground state energy , we found that the or method gives the quasiparticle mass different from the gep and ha results . in our examples , </S>",
    "<S> the self - organizing nature is revealed by the vacuum energy density that gets lowered when the quasiparticles are formed . in the @xmath1 theory , we found two physically meaningful duality - related quasiparticle solutions which have different symmetry properties under the transition of quasiparticle field @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , these two quasiparticle solutions yield the identical effective potential in the strong coupling limit of the original theory .    </S>",
