    "one of the most significant developments in the study of extragalactic globular cluster systems ( gcss ) was the discovery of bimodality in their color distributions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .  today",
    ", we generally refer to globular clusters ( gcs ) belonging to the blue peak of the color distribution as metal - poor gcs and to the red - peak members as the metal - rich sub - population .",
    "it is generally considered that the presence of multiple modes implies multiple distinct gc formation epochs and/or mechanisms and ties those directly into formation scenarios that have to describe the _",
    "parallel _ assembly histories of gcss _ and _ the diffuse stellar populations in their host galaxies .  in massive early - type galaxies the current gcs assembly paradigms view the origin of the two color peaks from the perspective of either episodic star - cluster formation bursts triggered by gas - rich galaxy mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , temporarily interrupted cluster formation ( so - called _ in - situ _ formation , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and star - cluster accretion as a result of the hierarchical assembly of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while the majority of gcss in early - type galaxies show clearly bimodal color distributions , the general picture is much more complex , ranging from purely blue to purely red color distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this complexity is exacerbated by the fact that color bimodality is a function of galaxy mass and morphology , as less massive and later - type galaxies tend to have single - mode blue ( i.e. metal - poor ) gc populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , color bimodality is also a function of galactocentric distance and is mainly due to the more extended spatial distribution of the metal - poor sub - population relative to metal - rich clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the aspect of gcs formation and assembly entered recently the domain of numerical simulations of galaxy formation due to the increasing spatial resolution of these computations .",
    "for instance , @xcite model gc formation by identifying absorbing sink particles in their smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) high - resolution simulation of isolated gaseous disks and their mergers .",
    "they find a bimodal globular - cluster metallicity distribution in their merger remnant under the assumption of a particular age - metallicity relation .",
    "a key finding of their merger simulation is a more concentrated spatial distribution of metal - rich gcs with respect to the metal - poor sub - population in good agreement with observations . since their models of isolated galaxies produce a smooth age distribution ( implying a smooth metallicity and color distribution ) , @xcite conclude that mergers are required to produce a bimodal metallicity ( i.e.  color ) distribution .    in a more detailed adaptive - grid cosmological simulation",
    ", @xcite followed the formation of a star - cluster system during the early evolution of a milky way - size disk galaxy to redshift @xmath1",
    ".  their model could reproduce the extended spatial distribution of metal - poor halo globular clusters as observed in m31 and the milky way . however , because their simulation does not follow the later evolution at @xmath2 it is unclear whether it would produce a metallicity bimodality and any significant age - metallicity relation .",
    "an alternative , more statistical approach to modeling gcs assembly is to directly link the mode of gc formation to the star - formation rate in semi - analytic models .",
    "@xcite were the first to explore this path by assuming that metal - poor gcs form in gaseous proto - galactic disks while metal - rich gcs are created during gaseous merger events .",
    "their study showed that the observed globular - cluster color bimodality can only be reproduced by artificially stopping the formation of metal - poor gcs at redshifts @xmath3 . by construction , no spatial information on metal - rich and/or metal - poor gcs is provided in these models .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pm04 ) presented a spatially resolved chemical evolution model for the formation of spheroids , which successfully reproduces a large number of photo - chemical properties that could be inferred from either the optical or from the x - ray spectra of the light coming from ellipticals .",
    "the model includes an initial gas infall and a subsequent galactic wind ; it takes into account detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions of both type - ii and ia supernovae as well as low and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "it has been extensively tested against the main photo - chemical properties of nearby ellipticals , including the observed increase of the @xmath0-enhancement in their stellar populations with galaxy mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is at variance with standard models based on the hierarchical merging paradigm , which do not reproduce this trend @xcite .",
    "since the pm04 model provides full radial information on the composite nature of stellar populations that make up elliptical galaxies , the observation of different gc sub - populations is , therefore , a new sanity check for the validity of this model .",
    "moreover , we recall that pm04 and , more recently , @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter pmc06 ) suggested that elliptical galaxies should form outside - in , namely the outermost regions form faster as well as develop an earlier galactic wind with respect to the central parts ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this mechanism implies that the stars in massive spheroids form a composite stellar population ( csp ) , whose chemical properties , in particular their metallicity distribution , changes with galactocentric distance .",
    "starting with the assumption that gc sub - populations trace the components of csps , we will show how the observed multi - modality in gcss can be ascribed to the radial variation in the underlying stellar populations .",
    "in particular , the observed gcss are a linear combination of gc sub - populations inhabiting a given projected galactocentric radius .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe the adopted theoretical model ; in section 3 we compare the predictions with observations and discuss the implications , while section 4 presents the final conclusions .",
    "the chemical evolution code for elliptical galaxies adopted here is described in pm04 , where we refer the reader for more details . in this work",
    ", we present the results for a galaxy with @xmath4 , taken from pm04 s model iib .",
    "this model is characterized by a @xcite imf , @xcite yields for massive stars , @xcite yields for type - ia sne , and @xcite yields for low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "an important feature of the pm04 model is its multi - zone nature , namely the model galaxy is divided into several non - interacting spherical shells of radius @xmath5 , which facilitate a detailed study of the radial variation of the photo - chemical properties of the gcs and its host galaxy . in each zone",
    "_ i _ , the equations for the chemical evolution of 21 chemical elements are solved ( see pm04 , @xcite ) .",
    "the model assumes that the galaxy assembles by merging of gaseous lumps on short timescales .",
    "the chemical composition of the lumps is assumed to be primordial .",
    "in fact , our model assumes that the accretion of primordial gas from the surroundings is more efficient in more massive systems , given their higher cross section per unit mass ( see pm04 ) .",
    "the model galaxy suffers a strong starburst which injects a large amount of energy into the interstellar medium , able to trigger a galactic wind , occurring at different times at different radii , mainly due to the radial variation of the potential well , which is shallower in the galactic outskirts .",
    "after the onset of wind activity the star formation is assumed to stop and the galaxy evolves passively with continuous mass loss . in order to correctly evaluate the amount of energy driving the wind , a detailed treatment of stellar feedback is included in the code ( that takes into account the stellar lifetimes ) . in particular , the energy restored to the interstellar medium by both type - ia and",
    "type - ii supernovae has been calculated in a self - consistent manner according to the time of explosion of each supernova and the characteristics of the ambient medium ( see pm04 for details ) .",
    "the potential well that keeps the gas bound to the galaxy is assumed to be dominated by a diffuse and massive halo of dark matter surrounding the galaxy .    in the following we",
    "adopt the standard star formation rate @xmath6 before the onset of the galactic wind ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is the gas density , @xmath9 the star - formation efficiency ; otherwise we assume that @xmath10 .",
    "we recall here that the adopted star - formation efficiency is @xmath11 , while the infall timescale is @xmath12 in the galactic core and @xmath13 at one effective radius ( of the diffuse light , @xmath14 ) , respectively .",
    "these values were chosen by pm04 in order to reproduce the majority of the chemical and photometric properties of ellipticals such as : the @xmath15[mg / fe]@xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the color - magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the observed gradients in metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath15[mg / fe]@xmath17 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and color ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite recently extended this model to explain also the properties of hot x - ray emitting halos surrounding more massive spheroids .",
    "the formation rate of gcs , @xmath18 , in the _ _ i-__th shell is assumed to be directly linked to its star formation rate @xmath19 via a suitable function of time _",
    "t _ , radius @xmath5 , and metallicity _ z _ , which represents some scaling law between star formation rate @xmath20 and the star cluster formation @xmath21 and can be regarded as a gc formation efficiency . a similar relation between the average star formation rate per surface area and the star cluster formation",
    "was recently found by @xcite to hold in nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "in addition , the efficiency of cluster formation in massive ellipticals appears to be constant , where the mass ratio between the mass in star clusters and the baryons locked in field stars+gas is @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "here we extend this surface density relation to 3-d space .",
    "moreover , pmc06 showed that at a given galactocentric radius model galaxies are made of a csp , namely a mixture of several simple stellar populations ( ssps ) each with a single age and chemical composition .",
    "the csp reflects the chemical enrichment history of the entire system , weighted by the star formation rate .",
    "we define the stellar metallicity distribution @xmath23 as the distribution of stars belonging to a given csp as a function of [ z / h ] .",
    "we can then write the globular - cluster metallicity distribution @xmath24 at a given radius @xmath5 and time @xmath25 as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 includes all the information pertaining to the connection between @xmath18 and @xmath20 .    it is not trivial , and beyond the scope of the paper , to find an explicit definition for @xmath28 , which basically carries the information on the internal physics of gas clouds where gcs are expected to form . in the following",
    "we will show that , for a few and sensible choices of @xmath27 , the observed multi - modality in the color distribution of globular clusters may be driven by the radial variations in the stellar population mix of ellipticals .",
    "we will first adopt a constant function @xmath27 ( see sec .  [ bimod ] ) and then allow @xmath27 to mildly vary with @xmath29 ( see sec .",
    "[ ref : metals ] ) .",
    "no absolute values for @xmath27 will be given , since our formalism deals with normalized distributions .",
    "in particular , the _ total _ @xmath24 summed over all radial shells can be written as : @xmath30 similar equations hold for other gc distributions as a function of either [ mg / fe ] or [ fe / h ] .    at this stage",
    "it is useful to recall that @xmath31 can be represented in two following ways : @xmath32 as the fraction of mass of a csp which is locked in stars at any given metallicity @xcite . in the following we refer to this stellar metallicity distribution as @xmath33 ( msmd : mass - weighted stellar metallicity distribution ) ; @xmath34 as a fraction of luminosity of the csp in each metallicity bin .",
    "this definition is closer to the measurement as it can be directly compared to the luminosity - weighted mean @xmath35 ( lsmd : luminosity - weighted stellar metallicity distribution ) at a given radius ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this classification is important since pmc06 showed that the @xmath33 and @xmath35 might differ , especially at large radii , even for old stellar populations .",
    "the advantage of gcss , for which accurate ages are known , is that they directly probe the mass - weighted distributions .    at this point",
    "it is useful to recall that our the adopted chemical evolution model divides the galaxy in several non - interacting shells . in each shell",
    "the time at which the galactic wind occurs is self - consistently evaluated from the _ local _ condition .",
    "in particular , we follow martinelli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggestion that gradients can arise as a consequence of a more prolonged sf , and thus stronger chemical enrichment , in the inner zones . in the galactic core ,",
    "in fact , the potential well is deeper and the supernovae ( sne ) driven wind develops later relative to the most external regions .",
    "this particular formation scenario leaves a characteristic imprint on the shape of both @xmath33 and @xmath35 and here we give some general considerations .",
    "in particular , we can explain the slow rise in the low metallicity tail of the distributions as the effect of the initially infalling gas , whereas the onset of the galactic wind sets the maximum metallicity of the @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "in general , the suggested outside - in formation process reflects in a more asymmetric stellar metallicity distribution at larger radii , where the galactic wind occurs earlier ( i.e. closer to the peak of the star formation rate ) , with respect to the galactic center . the _ qualitative _ agreement between these model predictions and the observed stellar metallicity distributions derived at different radii by harris & harris ( 2002 , see their fig .",
    "18 ) for the stars in the elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 is remarkable .",
    "if confirmed from observations in other ellipticals , the expected sharp truncation of @xmath33 at large radii might be the first direct evidence of a sudden and strong wind which stopped the star formation earlier in the galactic outskirts ( see pmc06 and pipino , dercole , & matteucci , in preparation ) .",
    "the general presence of multi - modal gcss implies that their host galaxies did not form in a single , isolated monolithic event , but experienced spatially and/or temporally separated star - formation bursts . in the recent past , both semi - analytic and hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation attempted to follow the process of gc formation @xcite , but neither could produce a clearly bimodal mdf in their simulated gcss .",
    "in this section we will show how to obtain a bimodal metallicity distribution function for gcs @xmath36 starting from single - mode stellar metallicity distribution functions @xmath31 ( commonly known as g - dwarf - like diagrams ) for the csp inhabiting different radii of a prototypical elliptical galaxy according to equation  [ gcmd1 ] .      as stressed in the introduction ,",
    "the multi - modality in gcss varies as a function of host galaxy properties ( e.g.  mass , morphological type , etc . ) . here",
    "we try to match the distributions resulting from the recent compilation of spectroscopic data by puzia et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter p06 ) , which samples the typical bimodal color distribution of gcs in nearby galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ colsamp ] , where we plot the @xmath37 color distribution of the p06 sample of gcs in elliptical galaxies ( _ top panel _ ) together with those of gcs in ngc  4472 and the milky way ( _ middle and bottom panel _ ) .",
    "ngc  4472 is the most luminous elliptical in the virgo galaxy cluster and hosts a gc system with a prototypical color bimodality ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to allow direct comparison with the p06 sample , we use gcs in ngc  4472 that are brighter than @xmath38 since the p06 sample includes only the brightest gcs in nearby early - type galaxies in order to maximize the s / n of their spectra",
    "the resulting color distribution is remarkably similar to the one of the p06 sample , which assures that the p06 sample includes a representative sampling of the gc color bimodality in massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "however , the comparison with the milky way gcs shows that the p06 sample covers few of the most metal - poor gcs .",
    "therefore , the _ bimodality _ which we refer to in the following may not be the same as the one observed in spirals or in some elliptical galaxies , where a substantial population of metal - poor clusters with [ z / h ]  @xmath39 is present ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we do not include the dynamical evolution of gcs in our model , since we are considering only the brightest ( most massive , i.e. @xmath40 , see also puzia et al .",
    "2004 , a&a 415 , 123 ) clusters in nearby galaxies as comparison sample .",
    "the comparison sample includes gcs much brighter than the typical turnover magnitude of the globular cluster luminosity function and we , therefore , do not expect significant differential dynamical evolution for these massive systems ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "in fact , it has been shown ( e.g. fall & zhang , 2001 ) that the timescales for both evaporation by two body relaxation and tidal stripping of star clusters is longer than a hubble time for gcs more massive than @xmath41 .    in our model",
    ", the number of clusters formed in a star - formation burst of a given strength is adjusted to match the observations .",
    "hence , the absolute scaling of gc numbers is arbitrary , i.e. , within physical limitations of the star formation rate any number of gcs can be reproduced by adjusting the function @xmath27 in equation  [ gcmd1 ] .",
    "if , however , metal - poor and metal - rich gcs are on systematically different orbits and experience significantly different dynamical evolutions the effect of tidal disruption might be slowly changing relative gc numbers with time .",
    "another complication is the variation of the initial star - cluster mass function , in particular as a function of metallicity .",
    "modeling these effects requires detailed knowledge of the orbital characteristics and chemo - dynamical processes that lead to star cluster formation , and goes far beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we keep these potential systematics in mind , but expect negligible impact on our analysis .      in order to make a first - order comparison between our model predictions and the observed @xmath36 at @xmath42 gyr",
    ", we first focus on the simple case in which :    @xmath43    with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 . the first term ( @xmath47 )",
    "corresponds to a population typical of the galaxy core ( well inside @xmath48 ) .",
    "the second term ( @xmath49 ) represents @xmath23 in the outer regions . in order to take into account the different amounts of stars formed in each galactic region ,",
    "we point out that the stellar metallicity distributions entering equation  [ gcmd1 ] were not normalized .    as a first step ,",
    "we take several values for the weights @xmath50 in order to mimic different mixtures of the two gc populations .",
    "in particular , we used the relative numbers of the _ red _ ( here identified as the metal - rich core population ) and the _ blue _ globular clusters ( the _ halo _ metal - poor population ) as a function of galactocentric radius for the elliptical galaxy ngc  1399 @xcite .",
    "our particular choice is driven by observationally motivated values for the weights , although we realize that ngc  1399 is a quite peculiar , massive cd elliptical and might not be representative of less massive    systems . in the context of this first step , the weights might reflect the effects of the projection on the sky of a three - dimensional structure .",
    "however , we show below that the results do not strongly depend on the weights .",
    "therefore they might be interpreted as mean values and could be changed if one decides to model a particular galaxy , with a different ellipticity , inclination , and luminosity profile .    in figure  [ gd_mass ]",
    "we show the globular - cluster metallicity distribution @xmath24 by mass ( computation based on @xmath33 ) in two radial bins for three particular choices of weights .",
    "in particular in the following we will use the ratios @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 in order to define the theoretical _ innermost , intermediate and outermost _ sub - sample of the gcs , respectively .",
    "these @xmath24 will be compared against subsamples of the p06 data , obtained by selecting gcs with either @xmath54 ( in the case of the innermost population ) or @xmath55 ( for the intermediate and the outemost cases , respectively ) , unless otherwise stated .      in order to plot the different cases on the same scale",
    "we normalize each @xmath24 by its maximum value . in the left panel of figure  [ gd_mass ]",
    "the shaded histogram represents the innermost population .",
    "our predictions match the data very well , especially in the metal - rich slope and the mean of the distribution .",
    "the same happens for the _ pure core _ populations , which shows how the gcs might be used to probe the csp in ellipticals .",
    "it should be remarked that a second peak centered at super - solar metallicity appears in the distribution predicted by our models , although not evident in the data of the particular radial sub - sample .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ gd_mass ] illustrates model predictions which are more representative of the galaxy as a whole ( either at @xmath56 , i.e. the _ intermediate _ population , or at several effective radii , the _ outermost _ population ) , and we consider them as the fiducial case .",
    "these two cases look quite similar to each other and have clear signs of bimodality in remarkable agreement with the spectroscopic data ( solid empty histogram , sub - sample of the p06 data with @xmath57 ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test returns @xmath58 probability that both model predictions and observations are drawn from the same parent distribution in the left panel of figure  [ gd_mass ] .",
    "the right panel statistics gives a lower likelihood of @xmath59 that both distributions have the same origin , which is mainly due to the observed excess of metal - poor gcs at large galactocentric radii compared to the model predictions .",
    "the prediction of a super - solar metallicity globular cluster sub - population is entirely new and a result of the radially varying and violent formation of the parent galaxy . moving to the low - metallicity tail , we predict slightly fewer low metallicity objects than expected from observations .",
    "but we recall the systematics mentioned in section  [ compsample ] .    in figure  [ gd_mass2 ] ( left panel )",
    "we show the results for a _ pure core _",
    "gcs , namely one in which we adopt @xmath60 . in this quite extreme case",
    "the observed gcs have been selected with radius @xmath61 .",
    "the histogram reflects the shape of a g - dwarf - like diagram expected for a typical csp inhabiting the galactic core .",
    "this finding is particularly important , because it might offer the opportunity to resolve the ssps in ellipticals , at variance with data coming from the integrated spectra which deal with luminosity - weighted quantities .",
    "whereas in figure  [ gd_mass2 ] ( right panel ) , the intermediate population is compared to a sub - sample of p06 gcs with @xmath62 .",
    "this is to show that the multimodality is not an artifact due to the particular radial binning adopted in this paper .",
    "figure  [ gd_lum ] shows the @xmath63-band luminosity - weighted @xmath64 for which the computation is based on @xmath35 .",
    "this metallicity distribution has been obtained by converting the mass in each [ z / h ] bin of the previous figure into @xmath65 , by means of the @xmath66 ratio computed by @xcite as a function of [ z / h ] for 13 gyr old ssps . due to the well - known increase of the @xmath66 in the high metallicity tail of the distribution and @xmath35 predicted for the same csp . ] , we notice in figure  [ gd_lum ] that now the second peak has a smaller intensity in all the cases .",
    "the corresponding diffuse - light population goes undetected in integrated - light studies . in any case , the conclusions reached by analyzing figure  [ gd_mass ] are not significantly altered .",
    "we conclude that our analysis is not significantly biased by some metallicity effect which may alter the shape of the observed @xmath36 by luminosity .",
    "we stress the power of gcss in disentangling stellar sub - populations in massive ellipticals , due to their nature as simple stellar populations that can be directly compared to ssp model predictions , unlike diffuse light measurements .",
    "even with this simple parametrization , where @xmath27 in equation  [ gcmd2 ] does not depend on metallicity , we suggest that the bimodality for the metal - rich gcs is the result of different shapes of @xmath33 ( and the @xmath35 ) at different galactocentric radii .",
    "finally , in figure  [ gd_mgfe ] we show the [ mg / fe ] distributions for gcs divided in radial bins as in figure  [ gd_mass ] . according to pmc06 ,",
    "these [ mg / fe ] distributions are narrower , more symmetric , and exhibit a smaller radial variation with respect to the [ z / h ] distributions . in any case ,",
    "a small degree of bimodality is still present .",
    "we point out the impressive agreement with the spectroscopic observations by p06 .",
    "there is a rather large discrepancy between data and models at the high-[mg / fe ] end .",
    "hence , the corresponding kolmogorov - smirnov likelihood tests return a probaility of 1% ( for inner sample ) and 95% ( for the outer ones ) .",
    "if we limit the model predictions to [ mg / fe ] @xmath67 0.8 dex , the agreement slightly improves , reaching a 10% probablity in the inner region .",
    "however , the inner field data still does not reach the extreme [ mg / fe ] values of the models .",
    "in fact , due to the monotonic decrease of the [ mg / fe ] as a function of either metallicity or time ( see pm04 ) , the lack of low - metallicity gcs , evident from figure  [ gd_mass ] , translates into a lack of @xmath0-enhanced clusters .",
    "the [ mg / fe ] bimodality of our model predictions and the match with the spectroscopic measurements strongly imply that globular clusters in massive elliptical galaxies form on two different timescales .",
    "their chemical compositions are consistent with an _ early _ mode with a duration of @xmath68 myr and a _ normal _ formation that lasted for @xmath69 myr . in fact , according to the time - delay model ( see matteucci , 2001 ) and given the typical star formation history of our model ellipticals , the [ mg / fe ] ratio in the gas - out of which the gcs form - is quickly and continuously decreasing with time .",
    "we predict that the [ mg / fe ] ratio can be higher than 0.65 dex ( i.e. in the bins in which our predictions exhibit a deficit of gcs with respect to the observed distribution ) only in the first @xmath70 myr ( see also fig.3 in p06 and related discussion ) .",
    "in fact , such a high value for the [ mg / fe ] can be attained only if very massive type ii sne contribute to the chemical evolution , without any contribution from either lower - mass type ii or type ia sne .",
    "normal _ formation , instead , is the one already plotted in fig .",
    "[ gd_mgfe ] and forms on a typical timescale of @xmath71 gyr .",
    "more quantitatively , our initial theoretical gcmd predicts that only @xmath72 of the gcs forms at [ mg / fe ] larger than 0.65 dex . in order to improve the agreement with observations we require that the above fraction should be increased to @xmath73 . since star and globular cluster formation are expected to be closely linked ( e.g. *",
    "* ) the same must be true for the diffuse stellar population of such galaxies .",
    "we therefore foresee the presence of a similar [ mg / fe ] bimodality in the diffuse light of massive elliptical galaxies . unfortunately , there are not direct observations confirming our suggestions , until the metallicity distributions for the diffuse stellar component in ellipticals will become available for a number of galaxies .",
    "indeed , the detection of bimodality in the [ mg / fe]-distribution might be a benchmark test for our predictions .",
    "we will still refer to multiple gc sub - populations .",
    "however , their differences ought to be ascribed only to the fact that they are created during an extended ( and intense ) star formation event during which the variation in chemical evolution is not negligible .",
    "the radial differences originate from the fact that the galactic wind epoch is tightly linked to the potential , occurring later in the innermost regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , pm04 and pmc06 found that also the infall timescale is linked to the galactocentric radius .",
    "in particular , it lasts longer in the more internal regions , owing to the continuous gas flows in the center of the galactic potential well .",
    "in particular , we recall that in our model the core experiences a longer ( @xmath74 gyr ) star - formation history with respect to the outskirts where the typical star - formation timescale is @xmath75 gyr .    according to our models",
    "the metal - rich population of gcs in massive elliptical galaxies may consist of multiple sub - populations which basically play the same role as the csps populating each galactocentric shell in our framework of the global galaxy evolution . at the same time , we point out the lack of our models to produce a significant fraction of metal - poor gcs similar to the halo gc population in the milky way , with the caveat that the star formation histories are very different .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that gcss in giant elliptical galaxies were assembled by accretion of a significant number of metal - poor gcs .      in this section",
    "we explore the approach outlined in equation  [ gcmd1 ] , by introducing the effect of metallicity in the function _",
    "f_. in particular , we start by assuming that @xmath76}\\!<\\!-1)}{f(t , r_i,{\\rm [ z / h]}\\!>\\!-1)}=2 \\ ; , \\ ] ] roughly following what was found for the gcs of the most nearby giant elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 ( centaurus a ) by @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter hh02 ) for their `` inner field '' , regardless of the radius of the @xmath77-th shell . since the final distributions are normalized , the actual zeropoint of the function @xmath27 is not relevant .",
    "our model predictions are plotted in figure  [ gc_hh ] .",
    "we notice a modest increase of the low - metalliticy tail of the distribution with respect to the simple picture sketched in section  [ bimod ] without metallicity dependence , as well as a lower fraction of globular clusters populating the high - metallicity peak . including the metallicity dependence leads to an ambiguous change in agreement with the general observed trend .",
    "hence , no firm conclusions on the real need for a metallicity dependence can be drawn .",
    "similar results are obtained in the more realistic case in which _ f _ is a linearly decreasing function of [ z / h ] .    at variance with hh02 , we chose to adopt the same scaling irrespective of galactocentric radius , for the following reason . despite the fact that the hh02 stellar metallicity distributions @xmath23 as functions of [ z / h ] confirm both the shape and the radial behavior of our model predictions for the mass - weighted stellar metallicity distribution @xmath33 ( compare their fig .  7 with pmc06 fig .",
    "4 ) , care should be taken when comparing their results for @xmath23 as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the latter , in fact , had been obtained by assuming a particular trend in the [ @xmath0/fe ] as a function of galactocentric radius which disagrees with the results of our detailed chemical evolution model .",
    "in particular , we find an offset of at least 0.2 dex in the sense that [ fe / h ]  @xmath78  [ fe / h ]  @xmath79 at a given metallicity ( [ z / h ] ) .",
    "this disagreement becomes larger either at very low metallicity or at larger galactocentric radii , where we expect a stronger @xmath0-enhancement .",
    "once the pm04 value for [ fe / h ] is adopted in fig .",
    "18 of hh02 , we find that : @xmath32 for the inner halo , the stellar @xmath33 should be shifted by @xmath75 dex toward lower metallicities , removing any metallicity effect , and @xmath34 for the outer halo the discrepancy between the stellar @xmath33 and the @xmath36 should be reduced .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that some decrease with time of the function _ f _ could be motivated by theoretical arguments .",
    "in fact , recent work ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that gcs of all ages preferentially form in turbulent high - pressure regions .",
    "if we interpret the decrease in the efficiency of star formation ( inside the gas clouds that form gcs ) , as a function of the ambient pressure @xcite as a proxy for the temporal behaviour of our function _",
    "f _ , we find again a reduction of a factor @xmath80 from the early high - pressure epochs to a late , more quiescent evolutionary phase .      for our fiducial model",
    "we predict a ratio of metal - poor ( namely with [ z / h ]  @xmath81 ) to metal - rich gcs of @xmath75 .",
    "previous photometric surveys found that the typical value for gc systems in elliptical galaxies is close to unity @xcite .",
    "provided a linear color - metallicity transformation ( see also section  [ othermechs ] ) , a possible explanation for the discrepancy between our models and the observations might be obtained by boosting the metal - poor population by a factor of @xmath82}\\!<\\!-1)}/{f(t , r_i,{\\rm [ z / h]}\\!>\\!-1)}\\ge 5 $ ] .",
    "another way to solve the discrepancy is to assume that all the _ missing _ globular clusters have been accreted from the surroundings , e.g. from dwarf satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we estimate the amount of the accreted metal - poor gcs , needed to achieve a ratio close to 1 , as a factor of @xmath83 of the number of globular clusters initially formed inside the galaxy .",
    "a natural consequence of the scenario depicted in sections  [ bimod ] and [ ref : metals ] is that , at a given galactocentric radius , the mean metallicity and [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios of a gcs coincide with the mass - weighted [ @xmath15z / h@xmath84 and [ @xmath85/fe@xmath84 of the underlying stellar population , because the gc quantities are calculated either from @xmath33 or the @xmath35 ( see eqs .  1 and 2 of pmc06 ) ,",
    "unless the scaling function _",
    "f _ is allowed to strongly vary with time .",
    "we expect this to happen at least in the innermost gc sub - populations , in which the effects of the accretion of gcs from the environment can be reasonably neglected .",
    "in particular , pm04 predict that more massive galaxies should show higher [ @xmath85/fe@xmath84 and [ @xmath15z / h@xmath84 . if accretion plays a negligible role",
    ", we expect the same correlations for the _ total _ gc population with host galaxy mass for the most massive systems , in agreement with current observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , if we perform the same study of the above sections for a @xmath86 galaxy ( see table 2 of pm04 for its properties ) , both peaks in @xmath36 shift their positions by about 0.2 dex to higher [ z / h ] .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure  13 and 14 ) .",
    "this trend holds for smaller objects as well .",
    "if we apply the procedure to a @xmath87 galaxy ( model iib of pm04 ) , we find that the metal - rich peak shifts towards a lower metallicity by 0.3 dex ( with respect to our fiducial model with @xmath88 ) , while the other peak is now centered around [ z / h ]  @xmath89 dex .",
    "in particular , we find a faster decrease in the mean metalliticy of the metal - poor gcs than for the metal - rich ones , again in agreement with the @xcite results .",
    "interestingly , the ratio of metal - poor to metal - rich cluster increases up to @xmath90 for less massive halos .",
    "we recall that in the pm04 scenario , the low - mass galaxies are those forming on a longer timescales and with a slower infall rate .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the combination of these factors is likely to at least partly explain the change of the gc distributions in different galaxy morphologies .",
    "this is especially the case in dwarf galaxies , where star formation is slow and still on - going , together with the fact that the probability for a substantial change in the pressure of the interstellar medium relative to its initial values is higher than in ellipticals , thus implying a much stronger variation of @xmath27 with time .",
    "it has been suggested that gc populations are produced during major merger events which would lead to present - day ellipticals and their rich gcss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) challenged this view by pointing out the much higher @xmath91 and more metal - rich gcss in early - type galaxies compared to those of spiral and irregular galaxies , which are thought to represent the early building blocks of massive ellipticals .    in the following ,",
    "we study the impact of the merger hypothesis on the predictions of our simulations . in order to do that",
    ", we extended the procedure sketched in the previous sections to the _ merger models _ presented by @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter pm06 ) . in this paper , the effects of late gas accretion episodes and subsequent merger - induced starbursts on the photo - chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies have been studied and compared to the picture of galaxy formation emerging from pm04 ; in particular the pm04 best model is taken here as a reference . by means of the comparison with the colour - magnitude relations and the @xmath92mg / fe@xmath93$]-@xmath94 relation observed in ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pm06 showed that either bursts involving a gas mass comparable to the mass already transformed into stars during the first episode of star formation and occurring at any redshift ( major mergers ) , or bursts occurring at low redshift ( i.e.  @xmath95 ) and with a large range of accreted mass ( minor mergers ) , are ruled out .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that the chemical abundances in the ism after the galactic wind ( and before the occurrence of the merger ) are dominated by type ia sn explosions , which continuously enrich the gas with their ejecta ( mainly fe ) .",
    "when the merger - induced starburst occurs , most stars form out of this enriched gas ( thus , e.g. , lowering the total @xmath92mg / fe@xmath96 $ ] ) ; at the same time , we expect the metallicities of gcs formed out of this gas to be on average higher and their [ mg / fe ] ratios to be lower than those of the bulk of stars and gcs formed in the initial starburst .    in this work",
    "we present the case in which the galaxy accretes a gas mass @xmath97 at @xmath98 gyr ( i.e.  @xmath99 gyr after the onset of the galactic wind ) .",
    "we make this choice for several reasons : @xmath77 this model is quite similar to the pm06 models _ b _ and _ g _ , which were among those in good agreement with observations of the diffuse galaxy light properties .",
    "@xmath100 ) the formation epoch of the bulk of these _ second generation _ gcs can not occur @xmath101 gyr later than @xmath102 , because the majority of gcs in the most massive elliptical galaxies studied today appear old within the age resolution of current photometric ( @xmath103 ) and spectroscopic studies ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "finally , the composition of the newly accreted gas is assumed to be primordial ( see pm06 for a detailed discussion ) , but we remark that we reach roughly the same conclusion in the case of solar composition , in order to mimic some pre - enrichment for the newly accreted gas .",
    "we point out that , lacking dynamics , pm06 presented their results for one - zone models .",
    "therefore , in this section we are considering equation  [ gcmd1 ] limited to only one shell .",
    "in this way we can check whether the single merger hypothesis alone is enough to produce some bimodality in the total globular - cluster metallicity distribution @xmath36 , and if it is consistent with the predictions based on our fiducial model described in section  [ ref : metals ] .",
    "we show our results in figure  [ gd_merg ] and [ gd_mgfe2 ] .",
    "we notice a clear change in the overall shape of the metallicity distribution @xmath36 with respect to the cases shown in the previous sections , in the sense that now @xmath36 is narrower and dominated by objects with super - solar metallicity ( and sub - solar [ mg / fe ] ratios ) with a dominant population at [ z / h ]  @xmath105 , which is not prominent in the observations of p06 .",
    "the high - metallicity globular cluster populations dominate the metallicity distribution which is at variance with both the results from previous sections and the observations .    our merger model does not include the accretion of globular clusters that were already formed within the accreted satellite galaxies .",
    "the inclusion of this effect could remedy the match between models and observations at low metallicities , as the typical gc in a dwarf galaxy is metal - poor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their addition to the initial gc population would enhance the total number of metal - poor gcs and improve the fit to the data . however , these clusters need to be @xmath0-enhanced to match the observations .",
    "the impact of gc accretion on our post - merger model predictions will be studied in detail in a future paper . here",
    ", we remark that the time at which the purely gaseous subsequent merger event can occur ( which does not import already formed gcs ) , is limited by the onset of the galactic wind , after which the type - ia sne dominates the nucleosynthesis , and needs to be completed at @xmath106 gyr after the first starburst .",
    "however , this time constraint implies that such merger events would overlap with the initial starburst and be mostly indistinguishable from each other .",
    "such a scenario closely resembles the searle - zinn scenario @xcite , in which galaxy halos are formed from the agglomeration of gaseous protogalactic fragments . later",
    "merger events are excluded in our models , as they would produce gcs with sub - solar [ mg / fe ] ratios which is at variance with the observations .",
    "note also that the fraction of gcs at [ z / h]@xmath107 can be recovered in our models only if the cluster formation at low metallicity is enhanced ( e.g. using a value of 10 instead of 2 in eq.[metaldepnd ] ) .",
    "however , even in the case in which we adopt some @xmath108 strongly declining with total metallicity , which may alter the shape of @xmath36 enhancing the low - metallicity tail and thus improving the agreement with observations , the position of both super - solar metallicity peaks will not change , remaining at variance with the data .",
    "the picture emerging from our analysis is far from being the general solution to explaining the complexity of gc color distributions , and it suggests only a scheme in which multiple mechanisms could be at work together , either broadening or adding features to the observed distributions .    for instance , @xcite suggested that the color bimodality could arise from the presence of hot horizontal - branch stars ( so far not accounted for in ssp model predictions ) that results in a non - linear color - metallicity transformation producing two color peaks from an originally single - peak metallicity distribution .",
    "we tested this scenario on our fiducial model gc metallicity distribution , by applying to each ssp the following transformation from [ fe / h ] to the @xmath109 color : @xmath110 } + \\gamma \\,{\\rm [ fe / h]}^2 \\\\\\nonumber                  + \\delta \\,{\\rm [ fe / h}]^3 + \\epsilon \\,{\\rm [ fe / h]}^4 \\label{eq_yoon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the numerical values of the coefficients are given in table  [ tab : coeff ] and the relation was adopted from @xcite and is consistent with the best - fit relation presented in their figure  1b .",
    "we show our results in figure  [ yoon ] .",
    "cr    @xmath0 & 1.5033 + @xmath111 & 0.172774 + @xmath112 & @xmath113 + @xmath114 & @xmath115 + @xmath116 & @xmath117 +    since we start from symmetric metallicity distributions , the non - linear transformation seems to work and produce a color bimodality for the csp inhabiting the @xmath118 shell ( figure [ yoon ] , solid line ) , although the bimodality is slightly exaggerated compared to real data ( see figure  [ colsamp ] ) . in fact , a look at the color distribution which we obtained for the sole @xmath119 shell reveals that it still has one peak and is roughly symmetric ( figure [ yoon ] , dashed line ) .",
    "obviously , since the @xmath120  [ fe / h ] relationship is meant to explain the gcs color bimodality without invoking any other effect , we did not combine the two histograms , either according to eq.[gcmd1 ] or to eq .",
    "[ gcmd2 ] in our models , as we are comparing metallicity distributions to spectroscopic measurements .",
    "it is of great importance to investigate this transformation with large and homogeneous data sets that cover a wide enough metallicity range to allow a robust analysis of the non - linear inflection point in the color - metallicity transformation .",
    "however , as a result of figure  [ yoon ] , we point out that the color bimodality typically found for gcss in massive early - type galaxies might be only partly due to a non - linear color - metallicity transformation .",
    "another effect put forward by , e.g.,@xcite is the claim that gcs might have undergone a self - enrichment phase at the early stages of their formation , and therefore some gcs could have experienced a boost in metallicity which would be not representative of the metallicity of their parent gas cloud . finally , as already mentioned above in section  [ ln : merger ] , some gcs residing in the outermost regions of the galaxies ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) could have experienced entirely different chemical enrichment histories at the time of their formation and later been added to a more massive system through accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the inclusion of these effects goes far beyond the scope of this work , but we remind the reader that all the aforementioned effects might influence the interpretation of any globular cluster color and metallicity distribution .",
    "by means of the comparison between pm04 s best model predictions for the radial changes in the csp chemical properties and the recent spectroscopic data on the metallicity distributions of extragalactic gcss from @xcite , we are able to derive some conclusions on the gc metallicity distributions in massive elliptical galaxies . in particular , we focused on the main drivers of the multi - modality that is observed in the majority of gcss in massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * we show that the observed multi - modality in the gc metallicity distributions can be ascribed to the radial variation in the underlying stellar populations in giant elliptical galaxies",
    ". in particular , the observed gcss are consistent with a linear combination of the gc sub - populations inhabiting different galactocentric radii projected on the sky . *",
    "a new prediction of our models , which is in astonishing agreement with the spectroscopic observations , is the presence of a super - solar metallicity mode that seems to emerge in the most massive elliptical galaxies . in smaller objects , instead ,",
    "this mode disappears quickly with decreasing stellar mass of the host galaxy . *   our models",
    "successfully reproduce the observed [ mg / fe ] bimodality in gcss of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "this , in turn , suggests a bimodality in formation timescales during the early formation epochs of gcs in massive galaxy halos .",
    "the two modes are consistent with an early ( initial ) and later ( triggered ) formation mode .",
    "* since the gc populations trace the properties of galactic csps in our scenario , we predict an increase of the mean metallicity of the cluster system with the host galaxy mass , which closely follows the mass - metallicity relation for ellipticals .",
    "moreover , we expect that a major fraction of the gcs ( i.e.  those born inside the galaxy ) follows an age - metalliticity relationship , in the sense that the older ones are also more @xmath0-enhanced and more metal - poor .",
    "* the role of host galaxy metallicity in shaping the observed gc metallicity distribution is non - negligible , although its effects have been estimated to change the function @xmath121 by a factor of @xmath122 , in order to match the sample of @xcite .",
    "either a non - linear color - metallicity transformation , or a stronger metallicity effect , and/or accretion of gcs from the surrounding environment is needed to explain a ratio of metal - poor to metal - rich gcs close to unity , as reported for ellipticals based on results from photometric surveys . * merger models which include the later accretion of primordial and/or solar - metallicity gas predict a shape for the gc metallicity distribution which is at variance with the spectroscopic observations .",

    "<S> the most massive elliptical galaxies show a prominent multi - modality in their globular cluster system color distributions . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the mechanisms which lead to multiple globular cluster sub - populations is essential for a complete picture of massive galaxy formation . by assuming that globular cluster formation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial variations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the pipino & matteucci ( 2004 ) multi - zone photo - chemical evolution code , we compute the distribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric radius .  we compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular clusters in nearby early - type galaxies by puzia et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) and show that the observed multi - modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can be , at least partly , ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts the presence of a super - metal - rich population of globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies , which is in very good agreement with the spectroscopic observations . </S>",
    "<S> the size of this high - metallicity population scales with galaxy mass , in the sense that more massive galaxies host larger such cluster populations . </S>",
    "<S> we predict an increase of mean metallicity of the globular cluster systems with host galaxy mass , and forecast that those clusters that were formed within the initial galaxy halo closely follow an age - metallicity and @xmath0/fe - metallicity relation , where older clusters exhibit lower metallicities and higher @xmath0/fe ratios . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we investigate the impact of other non - linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity distribution of globular cluster systems , in particular the role of merger - induced globular cluster formation and a non - linear color - metallicity transformation , and discuss their influence in the context of our model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a non - linear color - metallicity relation may be partly responsible for a color multi - modality . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the formation of globular clusters from subsequently accreted gas , either with primordial abundances or solar metallicity , delivers model predictions which are at variance with the observations , and suggests that a significant fraction of metal - poor globular clusters is accreted from satellite halos which formed their globular clusters independently . </S>"
