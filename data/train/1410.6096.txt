    "for comparison we also plot the best fit of eq . without the tls component ( @xmath51 0 ) .",
    "another mechanism that could potentially exhibit a linear temperature dependence is decoherence due to spin flips of paramagnetic chemical impurities in the crystal @xcite ; however , that mechanism would also exhibit a significant magnetic field dependence that we do not observe when comparing decoherence observed at 454 g and 6.4 kg ( see fig .
