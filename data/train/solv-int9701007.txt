    "the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation was embedded in a supersymmetric framework for the first time by manin and radul in @xcite . since",
    "then a number of integrable equations have been extended in this way .",
    "the role of the kdv equation and its virasoro constraints in two dimensional quantum gravity @xcite lead the group of alvarez - gaum to search for analogous structures for supersymmetric two dimensional quantum gravity @xcite . in turn , this motivated the study of virasoro constraints for the supersymmetric kadomtsev - petviashvilii ( kp ) hierarchies avaliable @xcite , which is connected with the study of additional symmetries of these hierarchies @xcite .",
    "these results indicated that the supersymmetric extensions of the kdv equation , in particular the manin - radul super kdv ( mrskdv ) , might be relevant in the study of susy 2d quantum gravity .",
    "the search of solutions of the manin - radul super kp started with the work of of radul @xcite on algebro - geometric type solutions .",
    "then in @xcite , from a sato grassmannian approach , the construction of solutions was outlined , nevertheless one can not find explicit examples in this paper . recently in @xcite",
    "some explicit solutions were obtained .",
    "the mrskdv system is defined in terms of three independent variables @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an odd supernumber , and @xmath2 are even supernumbers , and two dependent variables @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an odd function taking values in @xmath5 and @xmath6 is even function with values in @xmath7 .",
    "a basic ingredient is a superderivation defined by @xmath8 .",
    "the system is @xmath9 where we use the notation @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    the following linear system for the wave function @xmath12 , that takes values in the grassmann algebra @xmath13",
    ", @xmath14 where the spectral parameter @xmath15 is an even supernumber , has as its compatibility condition eqs .",
    "( [ mr ] ) , and therefore it can be considered as a lax pair for it .    our aim in this paper is to extend a well known tool , darboux transformations , in integrable system theory to the supersymmetric case .",
    "this tool is a well established scheme in dealing with integrable equations and its solutions @xcite .",
    "given an integrable equation and its lax pair the darboux technique consists of transforming simultaneously both fields and wave functions .",
    "for the kdv equation the lax pair is essentially the schrdinger equation , and this was precisely the equation where darboux developed his technique . on the one hand , recently one of the authors extended the standard darboux transformations to the supersymmetric kdv , @xcite . on the other hand , the other author has been involved recently in generalizing the standard darboux techniques to a vectorial darboux transformation , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a vectorial darboux transformation for the mrskdv , this transformation is represented in terms of ordinary determinants of an even operator .",
    "nevertheless , we do obtain essentially supersymmetric solutions .",
    "indeed any arbitrary solution can be used as seed solution to dress , and obtain therefore large families of new solutions having the seed solution as background .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we include the main results of the paper , namely the vectorial darboux transformation for the mrskdv equation ( [ mr ] ) . there",
    ", we also consider the reduction to the kdv equation .",
    "next , in  3 we study some explicit solutions selected among the large classes of explicit solutions offered by this method . in particular , we dress the vacuum solution to obtain soliton type solutions . here",
    "we also give some plots showing the behaviour of the field @xmath4 ( as the ones for the @xmath6 are similar we do not include them here ) .",
    "we end with some conclusions and remarks in section 4 .",
    "the linear system ( [ linear ] ) is of a scalar nature , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to give a vector extension of these linear problem .",
    "indeed , we may replace @xmath17 by an arbitrary linear grassmann space @xmath18 over @xmath17 and take @xmath19 as an @xmath18-valued eigenfunction , then the spectral parameter can be taken as @xmath20 , an even operator .",
    "namely , the linear system @xmath21 has as its compatibility condition the mrskdv system ( [ mr ] ) .",
    "notice that eqs .",
    "( [ mr ] ) is also the compatibility condition of adjoint linear system : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a linear function on the supervector space @xmath18 , and @xmath24 .    in order to construct darboux transformation for these linear systems",
    "we need to introduce an even operator , say @xmath25 , to this end we assume that @xmath26 is an even vector and @xmath27 an odd functional .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ veclin ] ) and ( [ aveclin ] ) , respectively .",
    "then , there exists a potential operator @xmath30 given by @xmath31 such that @xmath32    * proof * : a direct calculation shows that @xmath33 holds .",
    "we proceed by checking that the identity @xmath34 holds .",
    "a tedious but straightforward calculation shows @xmath35    now , we state the main result of the paper .",
    "let @xmath36 be an even vector satisfying eq .",
    "( [ veclin ] ) , @xmath37 an odd functional solving eq .",
    "( [ aveclin ] ) and @xmath38 a non singular even operator , @xmath39 , defined in terms of the compatible eqs .",
    "( [ pont ] ) and ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "then , the objects @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an operator with associated supermatrix obtained from the corresponding one of @xmath25 by replacing the @xmath42-th column by @xmath19 , satisfy the eqs .",
    "( [ veclin ] ) and ( [ aveclin ] ) whenever the unhatted variables do .",
    "thus , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are new solutions of the mrskdv ( [ mr ] ) .",
    "* proof : * is a tedious but straightforward calculation to check that @xmath45 satisfy eqs . ( [ veclin ] ) and ( [ aveclin ] ) .",
    "observe that form @xmath46 one has the relation @xmath47 , and therefore @xmath48 where we are using standard traces and determinants .",
    "notice also that , using cramer s rule , we have @xmath49    these three remarks lead to the desired result . @xmath50    [ [ reduction - to - kdv ] ] reduction to kdv + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the mrskdv system ( [ mr ] ) reduces to the kdv equation when @xmath51 .",
    "our darboux transformation is in fact compatible with this reduction , giving in this manner darboux transformation for the kdv equation . to see this",
    "let us first note that with the splitting @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ pont ] ) reads @xmath55    the linear systems ( [ veclin ] ) and ( [ aveclin ] ) with @xmath51 are @xmath56 and @xmath57    to proceed further , we assume @xmath58 so that @xmath59",
    ". then , our potential satisfies @xmath60 in this case , our darboux transformation tells us @xmath61 and since @xmath62 we conclude that @xmath63 satisfies the equations @xmath64 and therefore is a new solution of the kdv equation .",
    "notice that here we have a subtle point , observe that @xmath43 is not zero but in turn does not appear in the evolution equations because its particular structure .",
    "observe also that using the formula @xmath65 , the transformation for field u can be rewritten neatly as @xmath66 which a standard form for the solutions of the kdv equation @xcite .",
    "among the large classes of solutions provided by the just presented vectorial darboux transformation , in this section we select some relevant example by dressing the vacuum solution @xmath51 , @xmath67 . in doing",
    "so we obtain solutions , that for simplicity we denote by @xmath68 erasing the hat , of the mrskdv equation ( [ mr ] ) which can be considered as a superextension of the soliton solutions of kdv .    inserting @xmath69 in the linear systems",
    "one gets the equations for @xmath19 @xmath70    for simplicity we take @xmath71 , @xmath72 as diagonal even matrices , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "then , the functions @xmath19 and @xmath77 have the following form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    the operator @xmath25 , whenever @xmath81 for all @xmath82 , is determined by the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) , namely @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the expression can be made explicitly by means of substitutions @xmath87 where the superfix indicate the parities of the variables .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90    as a particular example one can pick @xmath91 as above and @xmath92 , which requires @xmath93 . in this case , the potential is @xmath94    to illustrate this family of solutions we shall consider the simplest case of a one dimensional space @xmath18 ( for simplicity we omit the index 1 next ) .",
    "hence , we have @xmath95    to invert the operator @xmath25 , we have to separate its body from its soul .",
    "we choose the supernumbers @xmath96 to have vanishing soul , so that the potential operator @xmath25 takes the following form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we notice that @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the constitutive elements for our solution are now @xmath103    it is easy to see that this solution can be considered as a supersymmetric extension of the soliton solution of the kdv equation . in fact , the constants can be chosen in such a way that the functions depending solely on @xmath104 appearing as multiplicative coefficients are exponentially localized in @xmath105 and travel with constant speed .",
    "moreover , the kdv soliton solution appears as a particular coefficient , @xmath106 .",
    "thus , our solution can be considered as a supersymmetric deformation of the standard kdv soliton .",
    "we write @xmath107 , and we plot the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the function @xmath108 , which is plotted in figure 1 , is just a kdv 1-soliton solution while @xmath109 , plotted in figure 2 , is a exponentially localized regular solution that travels with constant speed , now its shape is more involved that in the kdv soliton .",
    "we have constructed a darboux transformation of a vector nature for the manin - radul supersymmetric kdv system .",
    "we have further shown that our darboux transformation can be reduced to the kdv equation and is very effective when exact solutions are needed . the vectorial darboux transformation is given in terms of solutions of the lax pair and its adjoint which have a well defined and opposite parities .",
    "this implies that the darboux operator is even and that the new solution can be expressed in terms of ordinary determinants .",
    "however , this absence of superdeterminants is not a drawback because the proposed technique gives an efficient method of construction of genuine supersymmetric solutions .",
    "we further remark that the basic darboux transformations considered in @xcite can be iterated so that the crum type transformations may be obtained . in this case , the transformations will be represented in terms of superdeterminants of certain super wronski matrices . this and other related results will be presented elsewhere , @xcite .",
