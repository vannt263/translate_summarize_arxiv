    "jet production in high - energy scattering is a classical testing ground for qcd . not only can one measure typical qcd quantities , such as the strong coupling @xmath1 or the parton distributions functions ( pdf s ) , but also one has a handle to test perturbative qcd , including the factorization theorems .",
    "furthermore jet production processes can provide important backgrounds for the search of new physics .",
    "therefore jet production has recieved much attention in theoretical calculations and impressive progress has been made in the last decade to describe jet production in the framework of perturbative qcd .",
    "most available calculations have been performed in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy .",
    "there are several reasons to perform these nlo calculations .",
    "first , the theoretical uncertainties due to unphysical renormalization and factorization scale dependences are reduced .",
    "second , due to the emission of additional particles in the initial and final state , one becomes sensitve to jet algorithms , which is certainly the case in the experimental results .",
    "third , for the same reason , calculations become more sensitve to detector limitations .",
    "finally , the presence of infrared ( ir ) logarithms is clearly seen and regions where resummation is needed can be identified .    in the following",
    "i will review the state - of - the - art for perturbative calculations for @xmath0-scattering which can be tested at hera .",
    "jet production in @xmath0-scattering involves large transverse energies @xmath2 or photon virtualities @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of a large scale ensures that perturbative calculations can be performed and one can hope that hadronization corrections and theoretical uncertainties are small . in the following",
    "i will not present many experimental results , since these have been reviewed nicely in this workshop by m.  wing @xcite .",
    "presently the limiting factor for higher precision measurements of qcd parameters are the systematic and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "therefore , theoretical advances are in urge , such as nnlo calculations or nlo monte carlo programs ( mc s ) including parton showers and hadronization corrections .",
    "therefore , i will also discuss possibilities of combining fixed order calculations and parton showers ( ps ) , especially the problem of incorporating higher order corrections in the fixed order part of the mc s .",
    "i start by summarizing the procedure for the numerical evaluation of an inclusive @xmath4-jet cross section in nlo qcd .",
    "the first step is to select a jet algorithm , which defines how partons are recombined to give jets . in the following we take for definiteness the invariant mass @xmath5 of two partons @xmath6 and @xmath7 and",
    "define the @xmath4-jet region such that @xmath8 , with some kind of minimum mass @xmath9 and likewise the @xmath10-jet region such that @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "the lo process for the production of @xmath4 jets consists of @xmath4 final state partons and obviously does not depend on the jet definition .",
    "this dependence only comes in at nlo .",
    "the @xmath13 corrections to this process are given by the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergent one - loop contributions to the @xmath4-parton configuration , which are the virtual corrections , and the nlo tree level matrix elements with @xmath10 partons , the real corrections .",
    "the tree - level matrix elements have to be integrated over the phase space of the additional parton , which gives rise to collinear and soft singularities .",
    "after renormalization , the singularities in the virtual and soft / collinear contributions cancel and remaining poles are absorbed into parton distribution functions .",
    "one wants to integrate most of the phase space of the real corrections numerically , but one needs to find a procedure to calculate the soft / collinear contributions analytically as to explicitly cancel the poles from the virtual corrections .",
    "the two basic methods to perform these integrations are the subtraction method @xcite and the phase - space slicing ( pss ) method @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) .    in the following",
    "we will make use of the pss method and therefore discuss this method further . to illustrate the method , we rely on the classical example given by kunszt and soper @xcite .",
    "we label the lo born contribution as @xmath14 .",
    "the nlo cross section is given by the sum of the born cross section and the virtual and real corrections , @xmath15 and @xmath16 : ^=^b + ^v + ^r = ^b + c_v - _ 0 f(0 ) + _ 0 ^ 1 f(x )  .",
    "[ ks - ex ] here , @xmath17 is the known , but complicated function representing the @xmath10-parton matrix elements .",
    "the variable @xmath18 represents an angle between two partons or the energy of a gluon , the integral represents the phase - space intergation that has to be performed over the additional parton .",
    "the singularity of the real corrections at @xmath19 is compensated by the virtual corrections , given by the pole term and some constant , @xmath20 . in the pss method , the integral over the real corrections",
    "is divided into two parts , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we note that the technical cut - off @xmath23 should lie within the @xmath4 jet region , i.e. , if we define @xmath24 , then we should have @xmath25 .",
    "if the cut - off parameter is sufficiently small , @xmath26 , one can write @xmath27 where the integral has been regularized by the term @xmath28 , as suggested by dimensional regularization . the pole is now explicit and the nlo cross section @xmath29 is finite : ^ ^b + c_v + _ ^1",
    "f(x ) + f(0 ) ( )  .",
    "[ ex1 ] clearly , the real corrections @xmath16 should not depend on @xmath23 , and the logarithmic @xmath23 dependence of the last term in eqn ( [ ex1 ] ) should be canceled by the integral , which sometimes is numerically difficult for very small parameters @xmath23 . however , an improvement of the above solution is possible by using a hybrid of the pss and the subtraction methods , suggested by glover and sutton @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one adds and subtracts only the universal soft / collinear approximations for @xmath30 , such that @xmath31      + f(0 ) \\ln(\\delta ) +       \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0 } \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}f(0 )   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a cancellation between the analytical and numerical terms still occurs , however only the phase space is approximated , so that this method is valid at larger values of @xmath23 . in the case where the phase - space is not approximated for small @xmath18",
    "the hybrid method becomes independent from @xmath23 .",
    "in @xmath0-scattering , the interaction of the electron with the proton is mediated by a gauge boson ( @xmath32 ) with virtuality @xmath33 .",
    "the region from @xmath34 ( photoproduction ) up to the highest @xmath35  gev@xmath36 ( deep - inelastic scattering , dis ) is covered by the hera collider . in the dis region there are four available programs , namely disent @xcite , disaster++ @xcite , mepjet @xcite and jetvip  @xcite , based on the calculations in @xcite .",
    "the programs are summarized in table  1 ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "so far , only mepjet incorporates contributions from @xmath37 and @xmath38 exchange in nlo , which become important at virtualities above @xmath39  gev@xmath36 .",
    "therefore , a detailed comparison of the existing fixed order mc s is necessary to see whether these contributions are reliably predicted ( see @xcite ) .",
    ".summary of @xmath40 fixed order computer programs in dis . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1a ]    the results for the zeus kinematical conditions are shown in fig .",
    "[ xkp1 ]  a , b . in fig .",
    "[ xkp1 ]  a we plotted the full @xmath41 inclusive two - jet cross section ( dis ) as a function of @xmath18 for three different scales @xmath42 and @xmath43 with a fixed @xmath44  gev@xmath36 related to the mean @xmath45 of the forward jet and compared them with the measured points from zeus @xcite .",
    "the choice @xmath46 is mandatory if we want to include a resolved contribution .",
    "similar to the results obtained with mepjet and disent , the nlo direct cross section is by a factor 2 to 4 too small compared to the data .",
    "the variation inside the assumed range of scales is small , so that also with a reasonable change of scales we can not get agreement with the data . in fig .",
    "[ xkp1 ]  b we show the corresponding forward jet cross sections with the nlo resolved contribution included , labeled dir@xmath47+res , again for the three different scales @xmath48 as in fig .",
    "[ xkp1 ]  a. now we find good agreement with the zeus data .",
    "the scale dependence is not so large that we must fear our results not to be trustworthy .",
    "( 122,57 ) ( 27,-50 ) ( 88,-50 )    ( 122,51 ) ( 27,-50 ) ( 88,-50 )    in fig .  [ xkp1 ]  c ,",
    "d we show the results compared to the h1 data @xcite obtained with @xmath49  gev in the hera system . in the plot on the left the data",
    "are compared with the pure nlo direct prediction , which turns out to be too small by a similar factor as observed in the comparison with the zeus data . in fig .",
    "[ xkp1 ]  d the forward jet cross section is plotted with the nlo resolved contribution included in the way described above .",
    "we find good agreement with the h1 data inside the scale variation window @xmath50 .",
    "we have also compared the predictions with the data from the larger @xmath2 cut , namely @xmath51  gev , and found similar good agreement @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the nlo direct cross section through inclusion of resolved processes in nlo is mainly due to the convolution of the point - like term in the photon pdf with the nlo resolved matrix elements , which gives an approximation to the nnlo direct cross section without resolved contributions .",
    "one can therefore speculate that the forward jet cross section could be described within a fixed nnlo calculation , using only direct photons . in summary ,",
    "the nlo theory with a resolved virtual photon contribution as an approximation of the nnlo dis cross section , which is presently not available , gives a good description of the forward jet data .",
    "these results indicate that the resolved virtual photon approach might give some higher order contributions .",
    "however , the concepts of factorization and of the virtual photon structure function itself are not well defined for too large photon virtualities ( i.e.  certainly for @xmath52  gev@xmath36 ) due to @xmath53 and mass effects .",
    "this is a problem to be clearified in the future .",
    "there are two approaches to the problem of simulating high - energy physics processes .",
    "first , one can employ fixed order qcd calculations which deliver the partonic final state of a single event and which currently are available up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) for the case of inclusive jet production at hera .",
    "this approach has been discussed so far .",
    "second , monte carlo models are widely used which implement phenomenological descriptions of the parton cascades in the initial and final states , like for example parton shower ( ps ) algorithms in which a resummation of leading @xmath54 terms to all orders and a natural matching to hadronisation models lead to a good description of small - angle phenomena ( see @xcite for a summary of programs in @xmath0-scattering ) .",
    "the technical realisation of parton shower models has several shortcomings : a beforehand - calculation of the total cross - section is required to get a correct normaliztion of the cross sections , which might be difficult for any other physics scenario than the one - jet case .",
    "the cross - section predictions in the soft parton shower region as well as in the hard region are only in leading order ( lo ) .",
    "going to nlo , which is necessary in order to increase the predictive power of the event generators , is however made difficult by negative cross - section contributions which lead to numerical stability problems when being combined with the probabilistic sudakov approach to parton showers . in order to improve on the predictive power of the simulations , we have developed @xcite and implemented @xcite a method with which negative weights are avoided during the nlo calculation such that one easily arrives at the correct nlo weight in the ps region . for other approaches for combining ps and fixed order calculations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the born term @xmath55 and the virtual corrections @xmath15 to the nlo cross - section are easily evaluated analytically ; the real corrections @xmath16 can be written as an integral from @xmath56 to @xmath57 over a function @xmath58 which is basically the matrix element without the propagator ( beyond @xmath57 the hard region begins ) .",
    "one can then split the real corrections integral by some arbitrary parameter @xmath23 . choosing this parameter @xmath23 such that the born term , the virtual corrections and the soft / collinear part of the real corrections ( the two - body parts ) exactly cancel we are left only with an integral over the finite part of the real corrections ( three - body contributions ) which gives the complete nlo cross - section in the parton shower region",
    ". the corresponding value of @xmath23 , which depends on @xmath18 and @xmath3 and the renormalisation and factorisation scales , is denoted by @xmath59 : @xmath60    for the inclusive one - jet cross - section calculations we implemented @xcite the analytically derived function @xmath59 in the nlo qcd program disent @xcite and combined the nlo cross - sections thus obtained for the ps region with the final state parton shower from pythia @xcite .",
    "events where @xmath61 for any pair of partons @xmath12 are rejected ( this is the soft / collinear emission region ) .",
    "the hard region is described by @xmath62 matrix elements .",
    "ps emissions into the hard region are vetoed in order to avoid double - counting .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is typically of the order of 1 .",
    "we have checked that our results are reasonably stable against a variation of @xmath57 by a factor of 2 .",
    "( 122,125 ) ( 17,0 )    the zeus collaboration at hera has published jet spectra @xcite and jet shape data @xcite for the case of inclusive jet production in the laboratory frame . for the spectra , events with @xmath63125 @xmath64 , @xmath65 and an energy of the scattered electron of more than 10 gev were selected .",
    "the jets which were reconstructed using a @xmath53 algorithm were required to have transverse energies @xmath6614 gev and a pseudorapidity -1@xmath672 . for the jet shape analysis ,",
    "an iterative cone jet algorithm was used , and @xmath68100@xmath64 was required .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show comparisons of zeus inclusive jet @xmath2 spectra in three bins of @xmath3 ( a - c ) and of the integrated jet shape for the full @xmath3 and @xmath2 ranges ( d ) with a standard disent nlo calculation and with our results ( called disset ) .",
    "good agreement between the data , our result and disent can be observed for the inclusive spectra . for",
    "the jet shapes the disent result , which is only lo , fails .",
    "our result however is much closer to the data since we describe the soft region by the parton shower .",
    "the remaining difference between the data and our predictions can be accounted for by hadronisation effects as we checked using the lepto event generator@xcite .",
    "these results show that we correctly combine the nlo cross - section normalisation with the parton shower which describes the details of the hadronic final such as the jet shapes .",
    "currently , we are investigating the technically much more complicated case of dijet production in the breit frame . in principle",
    "the method described above works also for this physically more relevant case .",
    "however it turns out that the analytical solution of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is not straight forward .",
    "the relevant equation to be solved for @xmath59 becomes @xmath69 with analytical expressions for coefficients @xmath70 .",
    "we decided for a numerical evaluation of this equation using newton s method which after 4 to 5 iterations gives stable results , such that this way of estimating the cut - off is applicable in a mc enviroment , where many events have to be generated .",
    "we have described the status of next - to - leading order calculations for jet production in @xmath0-scattering at hera .",
    "we discussed the photoproduction , dis and intermediate regimes and found that especially the range of intermediate photon virtualities @xmath71  gev@xmath36 to be not well described by present nlo calculations .",
    "we finally described progress made for the problem of including higher order corrections into mc models , that include ps and hadronization .",
