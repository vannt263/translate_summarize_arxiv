    "the aim of this article is to report on some of the recent results obtained by the two authors on a non - commutative interpretation of the totally split degenerate fibers of an arithmetic surface .",
    "the results stated in the first part of the paper were announced in a talk given by the first author at the vii meeting of the cnta in may 2002 at montreal .",
    "the material presented in this note is based on the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be an arithmetic surface defined over @xmath1 ( or over @xmath2 , for a number field @xmath3 ) , having the smooth algebraic curve @xmath4 as its generic fiber .",
    "it is well known that , as a riemann surface , @xmath5 admits always a uniformization by means of a schottky group @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the presence of this uniformization plays a fundamental role in the theory of the `` fiber at infinity '' of @xmath0 described in @xcite and @xcite . in analogy to mumford s p - adic uniformization of algebraic curves ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) , the riemann surface @xmath5 can be interpreted as the boundary at infinity of a 3-manifold @xmath7 defined as the quotient of the real hyperbolic 3-space @xmath8 by the action of the schottky group @xmath6 . the space @xmath7 contains in its interior an infinite link of bounded geodesics .",
    "manin gave an expression for the arakelov green function on @xmath5 in terms of configurations of geodesics in @xmath7 , thus interpreting this tangle as the dual graph @xmath9 of the `` closed fiber at infinity '' of @xmath0 .",
    "in the first part of this paper we concentrate on manin s description of such dual graph and we exhibit the suspension flow @xmath10 of a dynamical system @xmath11 on the limit set of the schottky group @xmath6 as a geometric model for the dual graph @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , the first cohomology group of @xmath13 determines a model of the first cohomology of the dual graph of the `` fiber at infinity '' .",
    "furthermore , the first ( co)homology group of @xmath10 carries a natural filtration .",
    "a crucial feature of this construction is the fact ( proved in  5 of @xcite ) that this dynamical cohomology contains a subspace isomorphic to the archimedean cohomology of @xcite : the group of invariants for the action of the local monodromy `` at infinity '' .",
    "this space has also the correct geometric properties , in order to be interpreted in terms of a cohomology theory associated to a degeneration in a `` neighborhood of arithmetic infinity '' .",
    "our result identifies such space with a distinguished subspace of the cohomology of a topological space constructed in terms of geodesics in @xmath7 , our geometrc model of the dual graph . under this identification , the graded structure associated to the filtration on",
    "the ( co)homology of @xmath10 corresponds to the graded structure given by tate twists on the archimedean cohomology of @xcite .",
    "the cuntz - krieger algebra @xmath14 associated to the shift @xmath11 describes the `` ring of functions '' on a noncommutative space , which represents the quotient of the limit set @xmath15 of the schottky group , by the action of @xmath6 . in terms of the geometry of the fiber at arithmetic infinity , this space can be thought of as the set of components of the special fiber , or equivalently the vertices of the dual graph @xmath12 , whereas the quotient @xmath16 gives the edges of @xmath12 .",
    "the algebra @xmath14 carries a refined information on the action of the schottky group @xmath6 on its limit set .",
    "in particular , we construct a _",
    "spectral triple _ for this algebra .    in non - commutative geometry , the notion of a spectral triple provides the correct generalization of the classical structure of a riemannian manifold .",
    "the two notions agree on a commutative space . in the usual context of riemannian geometry , the definition of the infinitesimal element @xmath17 on a smooth spin manifold can be expressed in terms of the inverse of the classical dirac operator @xmath18 .",
    "this is the key remark that motivates the theory of spectral triples . in particular ,",
    "the geodesic distance between two points on the manifold is defined in terms of @xmath19 ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite  vi ) .",
    "the spectral triple that describes a classical riemannian spin manifold is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the algebra of complex valued smooth functions on the manifold , @xmath22 is the hilbert space of square integrable spinor sections , and @xmath18 is the classical dirac operator ( a square root of the laplacian ) .",
    "these data determine completely and uniquely the riemannian geometry on the manifold .",
    "it turns out that , when expressed in this form , the notion of spectral triple extends to more general non - commutative spaces , where the data @xmath20 consist of a @xmath23-algebra @xmath21 ( or more generally of a smooth subalgebra of a @xmath24-algebra ) with a representation as bounded operators on a hilbert space @xmath22 , and an operator @xmath18 on @xmath22 that verifies the main properties of a dirac operator .",
    "the notion of smoothness is determined by @xmath18 : the smooth elements of @xmath21 are defined by the intersection of domains of powers of the derivation given by commutator with @xmath25 .",
    "the basic geometric structure encoded by the theory of spectral triples is riemannian geometry , but in more refined cases , such as khler geometry , the additional structure can be easily encoded as additional symmetries .    in these constructions , the dirac operator @xmath18 is obtained from the grading operator associated to a filtration on the cochains of the complex that computes the dynamical cohomology . the induced operator on the subspace identified with the archimedean cohomology agrees with the `` logarithm of frobenius '' of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this structure further enriches the geometric interpretation of the archimedean cohomology , giving it the meaning of spinors on a noncommutative manifold , with the logarithm of frobenius introduced in @xcite in the role of the dirac operator .",
    "an advantage of this construction is that a completely analogous formulation exists in the case of mumford curves .",
    "this provides a unified description of the archimedean and totally split degenerate fibers of an arithmetic surface .",
    "let @xmath26 be a finite prime where @xmath27 has totally split degenerate reduction .",
    "then , the completion @xmath28 at @xmath26 of the generic fiber of @xmath29 is a split - degenerate stable curve over @xmath30 ( also called a mumford curve ) uniformized by the action of a @xmath26-adic schottky group @xmath6 .",
    "the dual graph of the reduction of @xmath28 coincides with a finite graph obtained as the quotient of a tree @xmath31 by the action of @xmath6 .",
    "the curve @xmath28 is holomorphically isomorphic to a quotient of a subset of the ends of the bruhat - tits tree @xmath32 of @xmath30 by the action of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , in this setting , the bruhat - tits tree at @xmath26 replaces the hyperbolic space @xmath8 `` at infinity '' , and the analog of the tangle of bounded geodesics in @xmath7 is played by doubly infinite walks in @xmath33 .    in analogy with the archimedean construction , we define the system @xmath34 where @xmath11 is an invertible shift map on the set @xmath35 of doubly - infinite walks on the graph @xmath33 .",
    "the first cohomology group @xmath36 of the mapping torus @xmath37 of @xmath11 inherits a natural filtration using which we introduce a dynamical cohomology group .",
    "we again have a cuntz - krieger graph algebra @xmath38 and we can construct a spectral triple as in the case at infinity , where again the dirac operator is related to the grading operator @xmath39 that computes the local factor as a regularized determinant , as in @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite , we also suggested a possible way of extending such construction to places that are not of split degenerate reduction , inspired by the `` foam space '' construction of @xcite and @xcite .",
