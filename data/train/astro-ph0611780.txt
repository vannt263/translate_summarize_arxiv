    "spontaneous particle production of pairs under the action of strong external fields attracts a lot of attention since it is a multi - particle non - perturbative effect which is still lacking experimental verification .",
    "according to the famous schwinger formula  @xcite the probability of particle creation in the constant electromagnetic field becomes essential if the field reaches the critical value @xmath0 .",
    "considering electron - positron pair creation in laser field we may conclude that one must have unattainable static field @xmath1 v / cm .",
    "however theoretical and numerical results obtained in recent papers ( e.g. @xcite ) show that the probability of particle creation in _ time - dependent _ fields can be gradually enhanced in contrast to static ones .",
    "also recent developments in laser technology ( method of chirped pulse amplification  @xcite ) and underway construction of x - ray free electron lasers will allow an experimental verification of spontaneous particle creation in the nearest future .",
    "fermion production in external time - dependent fields was considered in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "the method of the time - dependent bogoliubov transformation used there faces difficulties if the external field has more than one non - zero component , thus ke was obtained only for the linear polarized ( also called flux - tube geometry ) field ( @xmath2 ) . as was shown earlier for boson creation  @xcite in periodic laser field ,",
    "pair production is efficient if the field has rather the circular polarisation than the linear one .",
    "the approach presented in current paper resolves the problem of fermion creation in an arbitrary polarised field ( e.g. in hamilton gauge @xmath3 ) .",
    "this result can be of great importance for the theoretical predictions about dilepton and photon yield in high - intensity laser experiments  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the classical approach to the description of the particle creation in the external fields or in curved space is based on the time - dependent bogoliubov transformation  @xcite .",
    "concentrating on fermion fields we will briefly summarise this approach . first of all let us suppose that in the asymptotic states @xmath4 the external field vanishes .",
    "it means that for the limit @xmath4 the interpretation in terms of particles and antiparticles becomes possible .",
    "thus we can introduce the orthogonal set of functions @xmath5 , which represent the positive and negative frequency solution at @xmath6 .",
    "the field function can be decomposed as @xmath7 where we perform the sum over spin indices @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9(@xmath10 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the ( anti)particle with the spin @xmath8 and momentum @xmath11 .",
    "if we demand that the creation and annihilation operators introduced in this way satisfy general anticommutational relations , then the fock space can be constructed with the vacuum state defined at @xmath6 . however , following this procedure one can easily prove that hamiltonian in the external time - dependent field will be non - diagonal ( except the initial state @xmath6 ) . to diagonalize it one can use bogoliubov time - dependent transformation to redefine the particle creation @xmath12 and annihilation @xmath13 operators with nontrivial equations of motion for them . the particle number in this formalism can be defined at every time moment as @xmath14 .    in this work , we will use another approach  the so - called `` oscillator representation '' , which was earlier developed for bosonic systems  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to construct the field function and to define the time - dependent creation and annihilation operators so that the hamiltonian immediately becomes diagonal .",
    "moreover it should take the form of the free field hamiltonian at @xmath6 .",
    "the solution of equations of motion derived from dirac equation for introduced operators will provide the wanted distribution function @xmath15 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2 the oscillator representation formalism for fermions",
    "is given . in section 3 the kinetic equation",
    "is derived .",
    "the applications of the model and particularly the fermion production in the early universe are considered in section 4 .",

    "appendix contains the ke in the convenient form for numerical calculations .",
    "we start from the lagrangian for electrodynamics @xmath16where @xmath17 is the covariant derivative @xmath18 let us assume that the function @xmath19 is an arbitrary smooth function of time .",
    "we also demand that the electric field is classical and space - homogeneous with a continuous @xmath20 .",
    "the classical approximation is supported by the leading order of a large @xmath21 approximation , see e.g. @xcite .    in order to derive the correct oscillator representation of the fermion field one",
    "can use the foldy - wouthuysen transformation  @xcite : @xmath22 where summation over spinor indices ( @xmath23 ) is implied , and spinors @xmath24 are defined as a solution of free dirac equation in the particle rest frame : @xmath25    the unitary operator @xmath26 can be dependent both on time and momentum . according to the scheme of oscillator representation @xmath26",
    "is defined so that the hamiltonian density after the field decomposition @xmath27 becomes diagonal , i.e. @xmath28 with quasiparticle energy @xmath29 defined by kinetic momentum @xmath30 .",
    "this condition can be rewritten as @xmath31 with the following solution @xmath32 one can write down the explicit expression for @xmath33 in a close form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is given by @xmath36    it is easy to convince that @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the solutions of free dirac equation . taking into account these expressions ( [ or_fermions : u ] ) , ( [ or_fermions : v ] )",

    "past @xmath49 , the operators @xmath9 and @xmath50 should satisfy the classical anticommutation relations .",
    "however one can see that the second terms in the right part of the equations of motion ( [ m1 ] , [ m2 ] ) can modify the classical anticommutation relations in the presence of the time - dependent field .",
    "indeed let us assume that @xmath51 where the equation for unknown time - dependent matrix @xmath52 is derived by using ( [ m1 ] , [ m2 ] ) @xmath53 .",

    "further calculations will show that @xmath59 is coupled to one - particle correlator describing the antiparticle distribution @xmath60 and two anomalous correlators @xmath61 : @xmath62    ke is obtained by differentiating ( [ ms]-[opc_end ] ) with respect to time and subsequent substituting the equations of motion  ( [ m1]-[m2 ] ) and definitions ( [ ms]-[opc_end ] ) .",
