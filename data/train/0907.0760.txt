    "a stationary spherically symmetric wormhole may be defined as a handle or tunnel in a multiply - connected spacetime joining widely separated regions of the same spacetime or of different spacetimes @xcite .",
    "interest in wormholes was renewed by the realization that much of our universe is pervaded by a dynamic dark energy that causes the universe to accelerate @xcite : @xmath0 is positive in the friedmann equation @xmath1 . in the equation of state ( eos )",
    "@xmath2 , a value of @xmath3 is required for an accelerated expansion . the range of values @xmath4 is usually referred to as _ quintessence _ and the range @xmath5 as _ phantom energy_. in the latter case we get @xmath6 , in violation of the weak energy condition , considered to be a primary prerequisite for the existence of wormholes @xcite .",
    "the special case @xmath7 corresponds to einstein s cosmological constant .",
    "this value is sometimes called the _ cosmological constant barrier _ or the _ phantom divide_.    the quintessence and phantom energy models taken together as a _ joint model _ and dubbed _ quintom _ for short @xcite suggests a single eos , @xmath2 , to cover all cases .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , that @xmath8 can not cross the phantom divide , that is , in the traditional scalar field model , the eos can not cross the cosmological constant barrier .",
    "( for further discussion , see refs .",
    "the simplest quintom model involves two scalar fields , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , one quintessence - like and one phantom - like @xcite : @xmath11 so instead of @xmath8 in the eos , we will use @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "one reason for studying quintom dark energy is the bouncing universe @xcite , which provides a possible solution to the big - bang singularity .",
    "an extension to the braneworld scenario is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study various wormhole spacetimes that are supported by quintom dark energy .",
    "we discuss the structure of such wormholes by means of an embedding diagram , as well as the junction to an external schwarzschild spacetime . both isotropic and anisotropic pressures are considered .",
    "it is shown that in the isotropic models , the phantom - energy condition @xmath14 implies that @xmath15 , while in the anisotropic case , @xmath16 .    as a final comment , since quintessence satisfies the weak and null energy conditions , it is not feasible to model a wormhole using the quintessence field .",
    "so when considered as separate fields , only phantom energy can support a wormhole structure .",
    "in the present study the metric for a static spherically symmetric wormhole spacetime is taken as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "let us now consider a quintom model , which , as noted earlier , contains a quintessence - like field and a phantom - like field .",
    "so we assume that the einstein field equations can be written as @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the energy - momentum tensor of the quintessence - like field and is characterized by a free parameter @xmath12 , which is ordinarily restricted by the condition @xmath23 .",
    "( recall that this condition is required for an accelerated expansion . ) according to kiselev @xcite , the components of this tensor need to satisfy the conditions of additivity and linearity . taking into account the different signatures used in the line elements , the components can be stated as follows : @xmath24 @xmath25",
    "the energy - momentum tensor compatible with spherically symmetry is @xmath26 as already noted , a phantom - like field is characterized by the equation of state @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the radial pressure and @xmath14 . in the discussion below",
    ", @xmath29 is the lateral pressure .",
    "the einstein field equations in the orthonormal frame are stated next : @xmath30 + \\frac{1}{r^{2 } } = 8\\pi g",

    "for our first model we assume a constant redshift function , @xmath35 referred to as the zero - tidal - force solution in ref .",
    "the absence of tidal forces automatically satisfies a key traversability criterion .",
    "our first assumption in the present model is an isotropic pressure : @xmath36 adding eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) and using eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) , we get @xmath37 =   8\\pi g(\\omega_{ph}+1 ) \\rho.\\ ] ] multiplying eq .",
    "( 8) by @xmath38 and adding to eq .",
    "( 9 ) leads to @xmath39 where @xmath40    the above equation yields @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an integration constant .",
    "we rewrite the metric in the morris - thorne canonical form @xcite , @xmath43 $ ] , where the shape function is given by @xmath44    using eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , one gets the following forms for @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 and @xmath48    observe that @xmath49 , since @xmath50 , while @xmath51 implies that @xmath52 .",
    "it follows that @xmath53 .",
    "the assumption @xmath54 implies the absence of a horizon .",
    "also , we would like the wormhole spacetime to be asymptotically flat , that is , @xmath55 as @xmath56 . to this end",
    ", we require that @xmath57 . from eq . ( 13 ) we deduce that @xmath58 since @xmath14 , it now follows that @xmath15 , thereby having crossed the phantom divide .",
    "this result is hardly surprising , given the nature of phantom wormholes .",
    "on the other hand , the quintessence condition @xmath59 is still going to occur , namely in the anisotropic case , discussed next .      in the case of an anisotropic pressure ,",
    "the radial and lateral pressures are no longer equal . in an earlier paper on phantom - energy wormholes ,",
    "zaslavskii @xcite proposed the form @xmath60 , @xmath61 , for the lateral pressure . in this manner",
    "we obtain simple linear relationships between pressure and energy - density , but with @xmath28 not equal to @xmath29 .",
    "observe first that eq .",
    "( 11 ) remains the same . after multiplying eq .",
    "( 8) by @xmath38 and adding to eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we get , analogously , @xmath62 where @xmath63 otherwise eqs .",
    "( 14)-(17 ) retain their form .",
    "as before , we want @xmath64 .",
    "so from eq .",
    "( 19 ) , we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 since @xmath61 and @xmath14 , it follows that @xmath67 which is the condition for quintessence . in other words , in the anisotropic model , @xmath12 does not have to cross the phantom divide .",
    "_ remark : _ the parameter @xmath68 could be negative . for example , if @xmath69 , we return to @xmath15 .",
    "in this section we let @xmath70 . returning to the shape function @xmath71 , to meet the condition @xmath72",
    ", we must have @xmath73 .",
    "so the radius of the throat is @xmath74 and @xmath75 since @xmath76 , it now follows that @xmath77 , thereby satisfying the flare - out condition . from ref .",
    "@xcite , we therefore obtain the  exoticity condition \" @xmath78 ^ 2}=       \\frac{a}{2r_0 ^ 2}>0,\\ ] ] which shows that the weak energy condition has been violated .",
    "we already checked the asymptotic flatness , so that our solution describes a static traversable wormhole supported by quintom dark energy .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can picture the spacial shape of a wormhole by rotating the profile curve @xmath79 about the @xmath80axis .",
    "this curve is defined by @xmath81 for example , choosing @xmath82 , we find that @xmath83.\\ ] ] the profile curve is shown in figure 1 and the embedding diagram in figure 2 .",

    "@xmath85    for @xmath82 , @xmath86 ( see figure 3 . )    . ]",
    "it is customary to join the interior solution of a wormhole to an exterior schwarzschild solution at some @xmath87 .",
    "to do so , we demand that @xmath88 and @xmath89 be continuous at @xmath87 : @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93 are already continuous @xcite .",
    "so @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that @xmath96 .",
