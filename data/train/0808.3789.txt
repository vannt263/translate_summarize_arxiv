    "geometrically frustrated spin systems@xcite have been extensively investigated because of the fascinating fundamental physics they display .",
    "more recently , they have attracted interest due to their frequently possessing ground states with spiral magnetic structures.@xcite recent interest in such structures has been engendered by the rediscovery of systems where the magnetic ordering does not have a center of symmetry , and there is perforce a loss of a center of symmetry in the crystal structure as well .",
    "this helps to couple lattice and spin degrees of freedom and gives rise to a plethora of magnetoelectric phenomena.@xcite    the spinel structure type ( displayed in figure[fig : struc ] ) with the general formula ab@xmath0x@xmath1 , has been extensively studied in this light because of its ability to host magnetic cations on both its tetrahedrally coordinated a sublattice as well as its octahedrally coordinated b sublattice .",
    "additionally , both sublattices are geometrically frustrated with octahedral b sites forming a pyrochlore network , and the tetrahedral sites forming a diamond lattice .",
    "the former intrinsically displays geometric magnetic frustration associated with the difficulty of decorating the vertices of a tetrahedra with spins that are antialigned .",
    "the latter is frustrated because of competing near- and next - near neighbor interactions.@xcite    o@xmath1 structure showing edge - shared laths of bo@xmath6 octahedra ( blue - grey ) with b  b magnetic coupling across the edges .",
    "tetrahedrally coordinated a atoms ( dark grey ) connect the octahedral laths , and each a atoms has four b near - neighbors .",
    "oxygen are orange .",
    "[ fig : struc],width=302 ]    conventional wisdom , however , is that the dominant magnetic interactions are between the a and the b sublattices provided there are magnetic ions on both sites . adding to the complex nature of magnetic interactions in the spinel structure is that superexchange interactions between a - sites are mediated by atoms on the b - site ( even when the b site is non - magnetic ) , and in the same vein , b - b next - nearest - neighbor interactions are mediated by the a site ion.@xcite in the cubic spinel , the number of near neighbors ( nn ) and next - near - neighbors ( nnn ) for a are 4a(nn ) , 12b(nn ) , 12a(nnn ) , and 16b(nnn ) . for b ,",
    "the distribution is 6a(nn ) , 6b(nn ) , 8a(nnn ) , and 12b(nnn ) .",
    "in addition , most of the coupling pathways are multiply degenerate .",
    "these result in next - near neighbors contributing in an important manner to the overall magnetic ordering behavior.@xcite the high connectivity of the spinel lattice has been shown to give rise to a vast array of interesting magnetic phenomenon .",
    "@xcite    chromium spinels , where the b sublattice is fully occupied by cr@xmath7 , present a unique opportunity to examine these complex magnetic interactions due to the fact that cr@xmath7 will not invert to the tetrahedral a sites unlike many other transition metals , as a result of the very strong crystal field stabilization of octahedral @xmath3 cation ( @xmath8 crystal field ) . here",
    "we prepare and study clean samples of solid solutions of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 and cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 , two well studied chromium spinels with very different magnetic ground states .",
    "zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 , with a non - magnetic cation occupying the a site , undergoes a spin - driven jahn - teller - like distortion at low temperatures which results in a nel - type antiferromagnetic order.@xcite cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 , with magnetic cations on both sublattices , displays collinear ferrimagnetic as well as non - collinear spiral magnetic ordering.@xcite by replacing the zn with co our goal is to introduce magnetic interactions into an otherwise non - magnetic lattice and observe the effect this would have on the magnetic frustration of the system .",
    "this series is particularly interesting because it provides the opportunity to study the effects of dilute magnetic interactions in the absence of changes to the superexchange angle ( co@xmath9 and zn@xmath9 have very similar ionic radii ) or site disorder ( because of the strong octahedral site preference of cr@xmath7 ) .",
    "we find for low concentrations of co , a seeming increase in frustration resulting from spin disorder which results in a glassy magnetic state . at higher co concentrations",
    "there is evidence that the spins form non - collinear structures reminiscent of the cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 end member .",
    "monte carlo simulations of heisenberg spin systems have been performed which allow comparisons with the experimental magnetic susceptibility , and yield the appropriate range of @xmath10 couplings between the different sites to be estimated .",
    "they also suggest the minimal models required to describe the gross aspects of the magnetic susceptibility in these systems .",
    "we also demonstrate here that appropriate scaling of curie - weiss plots of the inverse magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature allows for systems with purely antiferromagnetic interactions to be distinguished by systems with more complex interactions .",
    "polycrystalline samples in the series were prepared by solid state routes .",
    "appropriate stoichiometric amounts of cobalt oxalate ( coc@xmath0o@xmath1@xmath112h@xmath0o ) , zno , and cr@xmath0o@xmath12 were mixed and ground with ethanol in an agate mortar .",
    "the powders were then pressed into 13 mm pellets and calcined in alumina crucibles at 800@xmath13c for 12h .",
    "these pellets were then reground , pressed back into pellets , and fired at 1150@xmath13c for 12h .",
    "the pellets were then briefly annealed at 800@xmath13c for 24h . during all heatings ,",
    "the pellets were placed on a bed of powder with the same stoichiometry to minimize reaction with the crucible .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns were obtained using cu - k@xmath14 radiation on a philips xpert mpd diffractometer operated at 45kv and 40ma .",
    "phase purity was subsequently determined by refining the patterns using the rietveld method as implemented in the xnd rietveld code.@xcite dc magnetization measurements were carried out using a quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "classical monte carlo simulations of the magnetic behavior of the system were performed using the alps project s spinmc application  @xcite .",
    "we generated a lattice with the appropriate fraction of a sites occupied for each simulation run in order to perform disorder averaging .",
    "the magnetic interactions were modeled by a nearest - neighbor heisenberg hamiltonian with antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 where the subscripts specify the sublattice types of the two spins connected by a given interaction . since the number of @xmath15 interactions in the system does not vary with @xmath5 , the other two couplings are varied relative to @xmath15 , which is set to unity ( in monte - carlo units ) throughout .",
    "the inverse magnetic susceptibility of each simulated system was fit to the experimental data by scaling both sets of data such that they satisfy the curie - weiss relationship at at high temperature .",
    "this is the same method used to plot the experimental data described below ",
    "see equation ( [ eqn : cw2 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in these simulations , `` high temperature '' means high relative to the temperature at which the inverse susceptibility strongly deviates from linear behavior . as discussed in what follows , the experiments could not actually be performed above @xmath18 where the curie - weiss law is strictly applicable .",
    "numerical simulations could indeed verify the following analytic expression for the curie - weiss temperature of the nearest - neighbor model    @xmath19    after a reasonable fit to the susceptibility was found for each experimental dataset , corresponding to the different @xmath5 values , the simulations were run again using a newly generated random lattice as many as 3 times to determine the effect of disorder .",
    "a disorder average was then performed by averaging the resulting inverse susceptibilities and the disorder error bars were taken to be the standard deviation of this average .",
    "finally , it should be noted that since the simulations were run until the monte carlo error was negligible ( relative errors of about @xmath20 ) , all numerical error bars shown below represent only the disorder error bars with the exception of the disorder - free @xmath21 end member .",
    "co@xmath22cr@xmath0o@xmath1 . ( a ) points are data and solid grey lines represent the rietveld least - squares analysis .",
    "( b ) evolution of the cubic cell parameter with co content @xmath5 .",
    "the line connecting end members is drawn as a guide to the eye to illustrate the vgard law .",
    "( c ) shows the steady decrease with @xmath5 of the internal positional parameter @xmath23 of oxygen .",
    "[ fig : xrd],width=302 ]    a portion of the x - ray diffraction patterns of the solid solution series are presented in figure[fig : xrd ] .",
    "all samples were found to be single phase with no extraneous peaks .",
    "the patterns were fit using the rietveld method to the normal cubic spinel crystal structure with appropriate mixed occupancies on the a site .",
    "the cubic cell parameter and the position of the oxygen atom @xmath24 in the unit cell were obtained from the refinement . because co and zn are relatively similar in terms of their x - ray scattering powers , no attempt was made to extract the relative concentrations of these ions in the lattice .",
    "the cell parameter @xmath25 and oxygen position @xmath23 extracted from the rietveld refinements are presented in figure[fig : xrd](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "co@xmath9 and zn@xmath9 in tetrahedral coordination have very similar ionic radii , 0.58 and 0.60 respectively,@xcite with co@xmath9 the slightly smaller ion . increasing co in the compounds should therefore lead to a contraction of the cell parameter .",
    "we find , however , a small expansion of the unit cell volume .",
    "this is consistent with previously reported structures of the end members.@xcite a possible reason for the expansion is that tetrahedral co@xmath9 is more ionic than zn@xmath9 and the substitution of zn by co introduces a  b cation - cation repulsions which expand the lattice .",
    "expansion in the cell parameters in order to minimize repulsion between neighboring cations has been suggested in other spinel systems.@xcite    changes in the @xmath23 parameter associated with o atoms in the unit cell occur as the structure tries to accommodate cations of different sizes .",
    "when @xmath26 , the anions are in an ideal cubic - close - packed arrangement , with perfect cro@xmath6 octahedra , while values of @xmath27 indicate an increase in size of the tetrahedron with a corresponding shrinkage and trigonal compression of the octahedron.@xcite as seen from figure[fig : xrd](c ) , there is a systematic decrease in @xmath23 with @xmath5 which brings it closer to the ideal value .",
    "this decrease implies that the tetrahedral sites shrink across the series , in keeping with the smaller size of co@xmath9 , but in contradiction with the unit cell expansion .",
    ".results from fitting the inverse magnetic susceptibility data to the curie - weiss equation .",
    "@xmath28 is taken as the @xmath5-intercept of the inverse susceptibility curve while @xmath29 is chosen as the first point of inflection in the first derivative of the susceptibility with respect to temperature .",
    "@xmath30 is defined as the absolute ratio of @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "the experimental effective moment is calculated using the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the slope of the inverse susceptibility versus temperature . the estimated moments (",
    "spin - only , and unquenched ) are obtain using @xmath33 .",
    "[ table : magnetism ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it turns out that a simple quantitative understanding of the susceptibility data in figure  [ fig : cw ] is possible as well .",
    "we performed classical monte carlo simulations of the nearest - neighbor heisenberg model on a b site spinel with a site doping and found a series of heisenberg coupling parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 that bring the simulations into rather close agreement with the experimental susceptibility measurements .",
    "the best fits obtained are shown in figure  [ fig : simul1 ] and the resulting coupling constant estimates are summarized in table  [ table : best_fits ] .",
    "the fits were first found using systems consisting of @xmath36 conventional cubic unit cells ( 1024 b sites ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we then checked the finite - size scaling on systems of @xmath37 unit cells ( 2000 b sites ) .",
    "it should also be noted that these best fits were determined by searching the parameter space , not by an optimization algorithm , so that quite likely even better agreement is possible using the same model .     and the following coupling parameters : @xmath34 = 0.45 and @xmath35 = 0.90 . [ fig : simul2],width=340 ]    we were encouraged to see that all of the best @xmath34 and @xmath35 parameters do not differ much from each other ( the @xmath38 data had too weak a dependence on @xmath17 for us to determine it effectively ) .",
    "evidently , the bulk magnetic behavior of the entire series of materials is well described by taking @xmath16 to be comparable to @xmath15 and taking @xmath17 to be about half of @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , it was considered useful to actually fix all the couplings to such values and only vary @xmath5  the resulting scan ( see figure  [ fig : simul2 ] ) shows that it is indeed the value of @xmath5 that most strongly determines the bulk magnetic properties of the system .",
    "the suprise is that for the range of parameters studied by which seem to be close to the experimentally measured susceptibility , @xmath16 and @xmath15 are effectively equal , rather than @xmath16 being significantly larger than @xmath15 ; the frequent expectation .",
    "lyons , kaplan , dwight , and menyuk ( lkdm ) @xcite have proposed the following inequality : @xmath39 implies collinear nel ordering of moments in spinels such as cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 . for @xmath40 non - collinear ordering is suggested . since in cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xmath41 = @xmath42 , we expect that if @xmath43 , the ground state will be non - collinear , which is certainly true for cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "so the monte carlo estimates of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are consistent with the experimental realization of non - collinear ground states.@xcite recently ederer and komeilj@xcite have performed detailed density functional calculations on the @xmath5 = 1 end - member , cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "they suggest that @xmath17 is important ( ignored by lkdm ) as determined here as well .",
    "while @xmath17 in their calculations is determined to be typically less than @xmath15 , they estimate that @xmath16 can be even twice as large as @xmath15 which is not the result obtianed in the preliminary analysis presented here .    ,",
    "width=340 ]    the results of the field - cooled susceptibility traces was used to construct a tentative magnetic phase diagram for the solid solutions as depicted in figure[fig : phase ] .",
    "we use changes in the slope of the field - cooled susceptibility as a function of temperature to obtain the boundaries between different magnetic phases .",
    "regardless of composition , all samples demonstrate paramagnetic behavior at high temperatures and begin to show transitions to long range order starting near 100k .",
    "the end member zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 is the only compound which exhibits long range antiferromagnetic order because of its structural distortion .",
    "we make the reasonable assumption that even small amounts of co result in glassy behavior as indicated by the line separating frustrated antiferromagnetism from glassy states . for concentrations of @xmath44 0.6",
    "the magnetic behavior begins to look more like that of cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 with a collinear ferrimagnetic transition between 50k and 100k followed by a transition into a non - collinear spiral at lower temperatures .",
    "the behavior near @xmath5 = 0.6 is rather complex and more experiments will be particularly important for this region of the phase diagram .",
    "the transition temperatures for the spiral appear to be slightly suppressed by zn substitution with respect to the end member as illustrated by the positive slope of the phase boundary as the cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 end member is approached . for the co - rich compounds at the lowest temperatures ,",
    "the structures begin to develop some spiral short range order ( sro).@xcite    in summary , we have prepared and studied the magnetic properties of a solid solution of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 and cocr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we have found that replacing non - magnetic cations with magnetic cations in the tetrahedral sites of a well ordered spinel results in a transition from glassy behavior at low concentrations of magnetic cations into a n@xmath45el - like ferrimagnetic order as well as commensurate and incommensurate magnetic spirals .",
    "these results are significant because they demonstrate that the presence of magnetic cations on the a - site can have the effect of relieving magnetic frustration on the b - site by allowing the system to find a lower energy state in the form of non - collinear magnetic spirals .",
    "monte carlo simulations suggest the minimum physiccs required to describe trends in the magnetic behavior , and suggest the range of strengths of the different magnetic couplings .",
    "we also present a useful form for plotting susceptibility data as a function of temperature which allows us to easily recognize the existence of uncompensated magnetic interactions in otherwise antiferromagnetic systems .",
