    "the vibrational studies of solid ice have gained attraction for scientific investigation over the decades .",
    "experimentally , the vibrational spectra of the different phases of ice have been investigated using infra - red ( ir ) and raman techniques , but due to the proton disordering in most such structures , the normal selection rules governing the interaction of radiation with these lattices are broken and hence any analysis of the spectra is difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "the ir and raman spectra are very sensitive to the intramolecular modes involving o - h stretching and bending , and less sensitive to the intermolecular modes involving the vibrations where the whole water molecules are moving against each other .",
    "therefore , in normal circumstances , only limited information ( the acoustic frequencies in particular ) can be obtained in the translational region .",
    "inelastic incoherent neutron scattering ( iins ) is only more reliable because its spectrum is directly proportional to the phonon density of states weighed by mean square amplitude associated with each mode and also the selection rule is not involved as all modes are measured simultaneously  @xcite . despite the detail information that can be obtained from the present days methods of coherent and incoherent scattering on the vibrational motions of the atoms or molecules of most systems based on the peak positions , intensities and their width , there are still many problems about the ice systems .",
    "these problems as mentioned , are usually associated with the the proton disordering .",
    "the phonon spectra measurements of renker  @xcite on ice - ih ( d@xmath2o ) made by time of flight using a chopper spectrometer were extensive but not complete in that information above 20 mev in the ( 001 ) direction and above 30 mev in other directions is missing , presumably because of a lack of scattering intensity and of the nature of the disordering of the protons in the ice structure .",
    "+ first - principles calculation of crystal structure and crystal properties is becoming standard technique , and the progress in the methods , algorithms , and computer capabilities allows to study larger systems of solids crystals in which crystalline ice can not be left out .",
    "the method has recently gained ground not only because of its reliability in the study of static and dynamics properties of ice  @xcite but also some important features such as modeling ordered periodic ice structure  @xcite , and also to probe the nature of hydrogen bond in different geometries  @xcite .",
    "its theoretical counterpart such as the classical modeled potential through empirical method  @xcite had some success in describing some important dynamical features , but to date , there is none capable of describing the ice dynamics and related properties across its whole spectral range and describing certain key spectral features .",
    "+ there are two techniques currently in use in the first - principles method in the study of lattice dynamics of crystals : the linear response method and the direct method . in the linear response method",
    "the dynamical matrix is obtained from the modification of the electron density , via the inverse dielectric matrix .",
    "the dielectric matrix is calculated from the eigenfunctions and energy levels of the unperturbed system  @xcite .",
    "it can be determined at any wave vector in the brillouin zone with the computational effort required comparable to that of a ground state optimization .",
    "only linear effects , such as harmonic phonons , are accessible to this technique . on the other hand ,",
    "the direct - method is based on the solution of the kohn - sham equation and it allows one to study both linear and non - linear effects .",
    "the calculations deal with a supercell , which allows explicit account to be taken of any perturbation .",
    "this method is rather straightforward computationally and there are a few standard software packages . within the direct method",
    "the phonon frequencies are calculated from hellmann - feyman forces generated by the small atomic displacements , one at a time . hence using the information of the crystal symmetry space group the force constants",
    "are derived , and the dynamical matrix is built and diagonalized , and its eigenvalues arranged into phonon dispersion relations . in this way , phonon frequencies at selected high frequencies at high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone can be calculated  @xcite . however ,",
    "when the interaction range ceases to be within the supercell , phonons at all wave vectors are determined exactly .",
    "the above statement has to be modified for polar crystals for which the macroscopic electric field splits off the infrared - active optic modes .",
    "the long - range part of the coulomb interaction corresponds to the macroscopic electric field arising from ionic displacements .",
    "+ ice is a tetrahedrally covalently bonded polar system whose dipole - dipole interactions give rise to the electric field when they are disturbed .",
    "the origin of the splitting is therefore the electrostatic field created by long wavelength modes of vibrations in such crystals .",
    "usually a microscopic electric field influences only the lo modes while to modes remain unaltered .",
    "the field therefore breaks the born - von krmn conditions , as a consequence with a direct method only finite wave vector @xmath3 calculations are possible .",
    "the lo / to splitting has therefore been found by calculating the effective born charge tensor and electronic dielectric constant introduced into the dynamical matrix in the form of a non - analytical term  @xcite or by calculating lo modes from elongated supercells  @xcite as will be discussed below .",
    "+ in our previous work , we have applied with success the direct method to the calculation of phonon dispersion of ice and its corresponding vibrational density of states  @xcite .",
    "the method reproduces the important features in the translational mode , librational mode , bending as well as the stretching region in comparison to the experimental results .",
    "the only ingredient that was missing in the previous work has been explained above , i.e. , a macroscopic electric field arising from dipolar interaction which is not taken into account . despite the huge computational demand of this problem , we did the additional calculation of born - effective charges which is supplied as ingredients to the direct method to identify the long - range part of interatomic force constants and makes the interpolation of phonon frequencies tractable .",
    "our overall aim is to help resolve the discrepancies in the reported phonon frequencies especially the puzzle behind the lo / to splitting of some optical modes at @xmath1 and provide first principles born - effective charges and dielectric tensors for direct method phonon calculations .",
    "the calculation of phonon dispersion relations were performed with the direct method .",
    "the direct method uses the hellmann - feymann ( hf ) forces calculated for the optimized supercell with one atom displaced from equilibrium position , derived from the force constants using the symmetry elements of the space group of the crystal , and calculates phonon frequencies by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix .",
    "+ in this work , the ice crystal structure optimization and calculation of hf forces have been performed with the density functional theory using the paw method within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite software .",

    "all the atomic degrees of freedom were relaxed with high precision .",
    "the optimum monkhorst pack of @xmath4 @xmath5-point was used in addition to the gga of perdew - wang to describe the exchange - correlation and the hydrogen bonding of water .",
    "we used a energy cut - off of 500 ev because the 2p valence electrons in oxygen require a large plane wave basis set to span the high energy states described by the wavefunction close to the oxygen nucleus , and also the hydrogen atoms require a larger number of planes waves in order to describe localization of their charges in real space . the relaxed geometry for the unit cell from the initial configurations containing 8 molecules is shown in fig .",
    "[ cellice ] .",
    "the starting geometry of the molecules in the cubic simulation box shown is such that no hydrogen bonds were present but the positions of oxygen atoms follow the tetrahedral geometry .",

    "@xcite is 6.35012652  for the cubic geometry .",
    "the calculations of force constants was carried out by considering a @xmath0 supercell containing 24 molecules of water which is obtained by matching 3 tetragonal unit cells . at the first step of the calculation ,",
    "the phonon software is used to define the appropriate crystal supercell for use of the direct method .",

    "the cummulant force constants @xmath21 are the sums of terms containing the second derivatives of the ground - state energy with respect to the position vectors of interacting atoms @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the hf forces in the direct method are derived using @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an amplitude of displacement of an atom in the supercell specially shifted from the equilibrium position .",
    "+ the symmetry of the supercell and the site symmetry of the non - equivalent atoms usually considerably reduce the number of displacements needed for reconstruction of @xmath26 .",
    "we are unfortunate in our case because of the hydrogen bonding fluctuations which makes the crystal structure complicated .",
    "therefore , we have to consider the whole 24 atoms in the supercell as independent displacements : in the positive and negative non - coplanar , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions . as done for the primitive unit cell , all the internal coordinates were relaxed until the atomic forces were less than @xmath30 ev /  .",
    "complete information of the values of force constants were obtained by displacing every atom of the primitive unit cells by 0.02  in both positive and negative @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions .",

    "the points are [ @xmath3300 ] , with @xmath33 = 1 , 1/3 , 2/3 .",
    "we calculate forces induced on all atoms of the supercell when a single atom is displaced from its equilibrium position , to obtain the force constant matrix , and hence the dynamical matrix .",
    "this is then followed by diagonalization of the dynamical matrix which leads to a set of eigenvalues for the phonon frequencies and the corresponding normal - mode eigenvectors .",
    "the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) is obtained by integrating over @xmath20-dependent phonon frequencies from the force - constant matrix in supercells derived from the primitive molecule unit cells . + for the ionic crystals the macroscopic electric field is taken into account by adding to eq .",

    "the response to a change in field is very rapid , so that the effects are independent of frequency up to microwave frequencies .",
    "the polarization in ice in general is due to the reorientation of molecules or bonds , that is , the energies of some of the proton configurations , that are compatible with the ice rules  @xcite , are lowered relative to others , so that in thermal equilibrium there is net polarization of ice .",
    "the achievement of this equilibrium state is a comparatively slow process that requires thermal activation and local violations of the ice rules .",

    "some of the off - diagonal contributions are too small .",
    "the observed anisotropic features can be attributed to the complexity of the hydrogen bond during the electron transfer process and also due to the dipole interaction of the water molecules in eq .",

    "also , there is a small shift of 0.1 mev from 204.6 mev in the bending region .",
    "the large shift of about 12.0 mev is observed from 362 mev in the stretching region because the strength of dipole interaction is large when there is symmetric stretching ( @xmath71 ) of o - h bond , while a tiny effect observed in the antisymmetric stretching is due to the compensation arising from simultaneous bond lengthening and shortening of the o - h covalent bond .",
