    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has started running . with its unprecedented center of mass energy , there is a high hope that it will discover new physics which revolutionizes high energy physics .",
    "however , lhc is a complicated machine with very high luminosities . in order to find new physics",
    ", we need to know what signals the new physics may give rise to , and how to search for them with the enormous standard model ( sm ) backgrounds .",
    "a major motivation for new physics at the tev scale is the hierarchy problem  the stability of the electroweak scale under radiative corrections .",
    "many models for tev - scale new physics are invented to address this problem , _",
    "e.g. , _ supersymmetry ( susy ) , technicolor models , large and warped extra dimensions , little higgs models , etc .",
    "a lot of collider phenomenology studies have been devoted to these models .",
    "however , these models certainly do not cover all possible new physics that may appear at the lhc .",
    "there is no theorem that at the tev scale we should only see the minimal models which just address the hierarchy problem .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", the collider searches should be signal - based . even though there are",
    "experimental studies targeted for some specific models , generic searches for new particles such as new gauge bosons , new quarks and leptons apply to a wide range of models .",
    "as the lhc is starting , the recent model - building efforts have shifted from `` solving problems of the standard model '' to studying models which can give rise to `` unexpected signals '' ( _ e.g. , _ hidden valleys  @xcite , quirks  @xcite , unparticles  @xcite , etc . ) irrespective of whether they are related to any particular problem of the standard model .",
    "it is possible that the tev - scale physics includes some of these extra sectors in additional to the standard scenario .",
    "the presence of the extra sector may obscure the experimental signals of the standard scenario if there is mixing between them , so it is imperative to study these possibilities and their experimental consequences . in this talk , consider such a case with a ( super)conformal sector softly broken at the tev scale and mixed with the supersymmetric standard model .",
    "as we will see , the mixings can make the superpartners of the sm particles have continuum spectra , and hence make their experimental consequences quite different from the standard susy scenario .",
    "this presentation is based on the work done in collaboration with haiying cai , anibal medina , and john terning  @xcite .",
    "we first give a brief introduction to unparticles . in ref .",
    "georgi:2007ek georgi considered the possibility that a hidden conformal field theory ( cft ) sector coupled to the sm through higher - dimensional operators , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scale where the interaction is induced , @xmath2 is the scale where the hidden sector becomes conformal , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the scaling dimension of the operator @xmath5 .",
    "there is no `` particle '' in a cft .",
    "one can only talk about operators with some scaling dimensions .",
    "the spectral densities are continuous and hence georgi called them `` unparticles . ''",
    "the phase space of an unparticle looks like a fractional number of particles . for a scalar unparticle , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a normalization constant . in the limit @xmath8",
    ", it becomes the phase space of a single massless particle , @xmath9 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the spectral density is continuous .    because the unparticle spectral density is continuous down to zero , many phenomenological consequences and constraints are similar to other scenarios with very light ( or massless ) degrees of freedom , _",
    "e.g. , _ large extra dimensions proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali  @xcite .",
    "a list of things to be considered contains    * invisible decays , _",
    "e.g. , _ from @xmath11 , heavy mesons , quarkonia , neutrinos , ",
    "@xcite , * missing energy in high energy collisions  @xcite , * higher - dimensional operators induced by unparticles  @xcite , * astrophysics : star ( sn1987a ) cooling  @xcite , * cosmology : big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite , * long - range forces induced by unparticles  @xcite .    in particular , unparticles can not carry sm charges if the spectral density continues down to zero without any gap .",
    "otherwise they would have been copiously produced and observed .",
    "however , as pointed by fox , rajaraman , and shirman  @xcite , coupling to the higgs sector will break the conformal invariance of the unparticles in the infrared ( ir ) , which will induce a gap in general . above the gap",
    ", there are two possibilities :    * if the theory confines , then it would produce qcd - like resonances . * if the theory does not confine , one then expect that the spectral density is still continuous above the mass gap .",
    "a simple ansatz to describe it is to introduce an ir cutoff @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13 such a spectral density arises when a massive particle couples to massless degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , quark jets can be considered as unparticles  @xcite .    with a mass gap ,",
    "many low - energy phenomenological constraints which result from new light degrees of freedom no longer apply .",
    "in particular , with a mass gap , one can consider the possibility that unparticles carry sm charges  @xcite ( if the gap is larger than @xmath14 gev ) , which can be more interesting phenomenologically .",
    "this is the scenario that will be discussed in this talk .",
    "a useful tool to study the ( large @xmath15 ) conformal field theory is the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "the metric of a 5d anti de sitter ( ads@xmath16 ) space in conformal coordinates is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the curvature radius and @xmath19 is the coordinate in the extra dimension . using the ads / cft correspondence",
    ", georgi s unparticle scenario can be described by the randall - sundrum ii ( rs2 )  @xcite setup .",
    "the 5-dimensional ( 5d ) bulk fields correspond to the 4-dimensional ( 4d ) cft operators , and the 5d bulk mass of a bulk field is related to the scaling dimension of the corresponding cft operator . in rs2 , the space is cut off by a uv brane ( located at @xmath20 ) but there is no ir brane which means that the conformal invariance is good down to zero energy .",
    "the momentum in the extra dimension of a bulk field is not quantized . from the 4d point of view",
    ", the momentum in the extra dimension becomes the mass in 4d , so the 4d mass spectrum is continuous .",
    "sm fields are localized on the uv brane .",
    "they can interact with the bulk fields ( cft operators ) through higher - dimensional interactions .",
    "such a representation allows us to perform calculations involving unparticles using the ordinary ( 5d ) field theory  @xcite .    in this talk",
    "we are interested in unparticles carrying sm charges with mass gaps .",
    "some modifications of the rs2 setup are necessary .",
    "in particular , sm fields have to propagate in the extra dimension as well and a soft wall is needed to produce the gap in the ir . before going to these discussions , we first describe how to formulate susy in the ads bulk .",
    "it is convenient to describe a 5d supersymmetric theory using the 4d @xmath21 superspace formalism  @xcite .",
    "the 5d @xmath21 susy corresponds to @xmath22 susy in 4d .",
    "a 5d @xmath21 hypermultiplet contains two chiral multiplets in 4d , @xmath23 .",

    "it is related to the dimension of the corresponding operator in the 4d cft picture  @xcite . for a left - handed cft operator @xmath26 ( which corresponds to the 5d bulk field @xmath27 )",
    ", we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the scaling dimensions of the scalar and fermion operators respectively . for @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "the correlator diverges as we take the uv brane to the ads boundary ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "a counter term is needed on the uv brane to cancel the divergence , which implies uv sensitivity . on the other hand , for @xmath36",
    "the cft becomes a free field theory with @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "we will focus on the most interesting range @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . for the right - handed cft operator",
    ", we have the similar interpretations but with @xmath41 .    in solving the equations of motion ( eoms ) ,",
    "we include a @xmath19-dependent mass @xmath42 which represents the soft wall .",
    "the eoms for the fermions and the @xmath43-terms are @xmath44 @xmath45 using the @xmath43-term equations we can find the second order eom for the scalars : @xmath46 we can decompose the 5d field into a product of the 4d field and a profile in the extra dimensions @xmath47 where @xmath48 represents the 4d momentum .",
    "then we find the profiles in the extra dimension @xmath49 satisfy the schrdinger - like equations with the potential determined by the mass term .",
    "for a constant mass , the potential scales as @xmath50 for large @xmath19 , so there is a continuum of solutions starting from zero energy ( 4d mass )",
    ". we can get different behaviors if @xmath51 for large @xmath19 :    * for @xmath52 , the potential still goes to zero for large @xmath19 , so we have continuum solutions without gap . * for @xmath53 , the potential grows without bounds at large @xmath19 , so we get discrete solutions  @xcite . * for @xmath54 ,",
    "the potential approaches a positive constant for large @xmath19 , so we have a continuum with a gap  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the last possibility so we consider the case @xmath55 . in the uv ( small @xmath19 ) , @xmath56",
    ", we have the usual cft interpretation . at large @xmath19 , @xmath57 , the conformal invariance in broken in the ir and a mass gap",
    "is developed .",
    "we can easily obtain the zero mode solutions for @xmath55 : @xmath58 one can see that only one of them has a normalizable zero mode . for definiteness we choose",
    "@xmath59 , then only the left - handed field has a zero mode , which is identified as the sm fermion .",
    "the nonzero modes satisfy the schrdinger - like equations , @xmath60 they have the same form as the radial wave equation of the hydrogen atom , @xmath61 except that @xmath62 is in general a fractional number instead of an integer .",
    "we can immediately see the pattern of the solutions from our knowledge of the hydrogen atom .",
    "for @xmath63 which corresponds to a repulsive coulomb potential , we have continuum solutions above the gap , @xmath64 . for @xmath65 on the other hand , we get discrete hydrogen - like spectrum below the gap in addition to the continuum above the gap",
    ".      one can derive the unparticle propagator by probing the cft with a boundary source field @xmath66 .",
    "the holographic boundary action can be obtained by integrating out the bulk using the bulk eoms with the boundary condition @xmath67  @xcite,@xmath68\\label{holoaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 from the cft point of view , the right - handed superfield @xmath66 is a source of the left - handed cft operator which correspond to @xmath27 . since @xmath70 is the source for the scalar component , the propagator for the scalar cft operator is @xmath71 with @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the whittaker function of the second kind .",
    "the fermionic and the @xmath43-component cft correlators are simply @xmath74 and @xmath75 by susy relations .",
    "we are interested in the conformal limit @xmath35 , so we expand @xmath76 for small @xmath77 and focus on the range @xmath78 .",
    "after properly rescaling the correlator by a power of @xmath77 to account for the correct dimension of the correlator , we find @xmath79 the first term vanishes in the conformal limit for @xmath78 .",
    "we can see that there is a pole at @xmath80 which represents the zero mode , and a branch cut for @xmath81 which represents the continuum in the propagator . for @xmath82",
    ", there are addition poles below the gap @xmath83 which correspond to the hydrogen - like bound states discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "now we introduce susy breaking on the uv boundary by a scalar mass term , @xmath84 the scalar propagator is modified due to the modified boundary conditions , @xmath85 one can repeat the analysis of the previous subsection and finds for @xmath78 in the limit @xmath35 , @xmath86 for small @xmath87 , the pole which was at zero mass is shifted to @xmath88    the shift is smaller for smaller ( more negative ) @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ logm2 ] ) , because the zero mode wave function is localized farther away from the uv brane ( @xmath89 ) .    for @xmath90 ,",
    "as we increase @xmath87 , the pole eventually merge into the continuum and only a continuum superpartner is left ( fig .",
    "[ merge ] ) .",
    "the continuum parts of the spectral functions for several choices of @xmath87 are shown in fig .",
    "[ continuum3 ] .    for @xmath91 , the discrete poles below the gap move towards the gap as @xmath87 increase ( fig .  [ susybreaking ]",
    "however , they do not merge into the continuum for arbitrarily large @xmath87 .",
    "a 5d @xmath21 vector supermultiplet can be decomposed into a 4d @xmath21 vector supermultiplet @xmath92 and a chiral supermultiplet @xmath93 .",
    "we can not proceed as before by introducing a bulk mass term for the gauge field because of the gauge invariance .",
    "the same effect can be obtained with a dilaton profile @xmath94 coupling to the gauge kinetic term , which softly breaks the conformal symmetry in the ir  @xcite .",
    "the action for the 5d @xmath21 vector supermultiplet can be written as @xmath95 we can obtain the bulk action in components after rescaling the fields , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "we find a @xmath19-dependent bulk gaugino mass @xmath99 induced by the dilaton profile .",
    "it leads to a continuum with a mass gap as we found for the matter fields , and @xmath62 is fixed to be equal to @xmath100 in this case because the 4d gauge field must have dimension one by gauge invariance .    adding a susy - breaking gaugino mass term on the uv brane will lift the gaugino zero mode . for small majorana gaugino mass @xmath12 on the uv brane ,",
    "the zero mode pole is shifted to @xmath101 for large gaugino mass the zero mode will merge into the continuum just as what we saw for the scalar superpartners of matter fields with @xmath102 .",
    "we discussed a novel possibility for the supersymmetric extension of the standard model , where there are continuum excitations of the sm particles and their superpartners arising from conformal dynamics .",
    "the properties of the superpartners can be quite different in this type of models .",
    "the superpartner of a standard model particle can be either a discrete mode below a continuum , or the first of a series of discrete modes , or just a continuum .",
    "the continuum superpartners will be quite challenging experimentally .",
    "it would be difficult to reconstruct any peak or edge because of the additional smearing of the mass by the continuous spectrum .    at a high energy collider ,",
    "if the superpartners are produced well above the threshold of the continuum , there is a possibility of extended decay chains as shown in fig .",
    "[ chain ] .",
    "these events are expected to have large multiplicities and more spherical shapes as a reflection of the underlying conformal theory  @xcite .",
    "the experimental searches and verifications of this scenario will be very challenging .",
    "it is a topic under current investigation",
    ". the lhc will be the only high energy collider in the foreseeable future .",
