    "three neutrino masses do not appear to be able to explain all of the three signatures @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "one way to solve this puzzle is to introduce different mass spectra for the neutrino and antineutrino sector , thereby requiring cpt - violation but no extra neutrino generations @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to add additional neutrinos with no standard weak couplings , often called `` sterile neutrinos '' .",
    "+ in this paper we assume cpt- and cp - invariance , and we explore the possibility of adding one or two neutrino generations beyond the three active flavors assumed by the standard model .",
    "we focus on extensions of the neutrino sector where the addition of fourth and fifth mass eigenstates are responsible for the high @xmath5 lsnd oscillations , and the three lower mass states explain solar and atmospheric oscillations .",

    "the data are binned into 30 bins , covering ten bins in visible energy between 3 and 170 gev , and three radial bins in the neutrino interaction vertex .",
    "a @xmath61 analysis is performed , using the final nomad numbers on the observed and predicted electron - to - muon ratio , including statistical errors as well as the full error matrix describing systematic uncertainties and uncertainty correlations over different bins @xcite . in predicting the effect of @xmath118 oscillations under any mass and mixing hypothesis , the contribution to @xmath260 from oscillations with full mixing and @xmath261 expected in nomad after all cuts",

    "slightly better fits to the data are obtained under a neutrino oscillations hypothesis , as opposed to the no oscillations one .",
    "therefore , we add a final comment to explain the results of these fits .",
    "+ the bugey fit is driven by the data at the shortest baseline , 15 m , where the statistical errors on the observed positron spectrum from @xmath2 interactions are the smallest .",
    "as explained in ref.@xcite , systematic uncertainties are taken into account by allowing for linear deformations , as a function of positron energy , of the ratio of observed to predicted positron yields .",
    "the values of @xmath263 as a function of @xmath5 are explained by the fact that , for certain @xmath5 values , an oscillatory fit to the 15 m positron spectrum ratio describes the data marginally better than any straight line .",
    "our best - fit oscillation hypothesis to bugey data only is @xmath107 , @xmath264 .",
    "+ for cdhs , the @xmath265 curve in fig .  [ fig : fig8]d has a minimum at @xmath266",
    ". this minimum is due to the fact that the far / near @xmath0 rate ratio , corrected for the baseline and detector mass differences between the two detectors ( as well as other minor effects ) , is measured to be slightly greater than one @xcite : @xmath267 .",
    "this marginal deviation from one causes the fit procedure to prefer more @xmath0 disappearance by oscillations in the near than in the far detector .",
    "given the average @xmath0 energy ( 3.2 gev ) and pathlength ( 130 m ) for neutrinos interacting in the cdhs near detector , this condition is satisfied in the @xmath268 range .",
    "our best - fit oscillation hypothesis to cdhs data only is @xmath269 , @xmath270 .",
