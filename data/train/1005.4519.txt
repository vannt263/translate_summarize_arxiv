    "it has been established that ultra - cold bose and fermi gases trapped in optical lattices provide experimental realizations of long - standing lattice models widely considered in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics , such as the bose and fermi hubbard models  @xcite .",
    "one of the most spectacular achievements was the observation of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition as the optical lattice depth is varied  @xcite .",
    "this transition has been explained in light of the bose - hubbard model with on - site repulsive interactions and hopping between nearest - neighboring sites . in the superfluid phase , each atom is spread out over the entire lattice , with long - range phase coherence , whereas in the insulating phase , exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites , with no phase coherence across the lattice ; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum and a vanishing compressibility .",
    "similarly , recent experiments have provided evidence on the formation of a mott insulator of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "several challenges arise when quantitatively comparing experimental data and theoretical results obtained from the analysis of infinite systems .",
    "one of the most important problems is due to inevitable spatial inhomogeneities induced by the optical trap , which is necessary to confine particles  @xcite .",
    "further complications are connected to determine temperature effects present in experiments  @xcite , and also to the limited available tools for the experimental characterization of the phases .    here",
    ", we would like to focus our attention on the possibility to make quantitative estimations of the mott gap @xmath0 from relatively simple quantities that can be experimentally addressed . in presence of the optical trap ,",
    "it is usually not possible to have a mott insulating phase throughout the whole lattice and compressible regions intrude the system .",
    "this fact has been widely discussed both experimentally and theoretically and shows up through the typical `` wedding - cake '' profile of density  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the system always possesses regions that are locally compressible and a precise determination of the mott gap is subtler than in the homogeneous case . some preliminary attempts to measure the excitation spectrum of interacting bosons",
    "have been performed by using bragg spectroscopy  @xcite . other approaches to characterize the appearance of mott - insulating regions from experimentally accessible quantities",
    "have been also proposed  @xcite . here",
    ", we would like to propose an alternative approach that is based upon energy measurements only and could give important insights about the appearance of mott - insulating regions , as well as the actual value of the gap .",
    "for an _ infinite and homogeneous _ system , the excitation gap @xmath0 can be calculated from the knowledge of the total energy for different particle numbers , namely @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 being the ground - state energy with @xmath4 particles .",
    "the mott gap @xmath0 is finite whenever @xmath5 and , therefore , introduces a discontinuity in the first derivative of the energy with respect to the density .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that the existence of incompressible mott regions and the values of the corresponding gaps can be obtained from so - called _ release energy _",
    "@xmath6 , which may be measured experimentally  @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath6 is obtained by integrating the momentum distribution of the atoms after having switched off the confinement and let the atoms expand freely .",
    "the release energy is given by the sum of the kinetic and interaction energies just before switching off the trap  @xcite @xmath7 we notice that it would be much more difficult to extract the _ total energy _ , @xmath8 that also includes the potential term due to the trap , since this would require the knowledge of the density profile in the presence of the trap , which is hard to reconstruct .    specifically , we address two types of confinement _",
    "i ) _ the usual harmonic confinement and _ ii ) _ a recently proposed off - diagonal confinement  @xcite . in such a confinement ,",
    "the strength of the hopping parameter is varied across the lattice , being maximum at the center of the lattice and vanishing at its edges , which naturally induces a trapping of the particles .",
    "we consider bosons loaded in one- and two - dimensional optical lattices and use an insightful variational approach based upon the gutzwiller wave function  @xcite .",
    "similar results must hold also in fermionic systems .",
    "moreover , although approximated , this variational method is expected to correctly capture the behavior of the exact ground state .",
    "we find that the presence of mott regions in the system is signaled by discontinuities in the derivative of the release - energy curve with respect to the total number of bosons , reminiscent of the presence of a gap in infinite homogeneous system . in the case of harmonic confinement",
    ", the measured gap may be substantially smaller than the one of the uniform system , whereas a much closer agreement is achieved by considering the off - diagonal confinement .",
    "the emergence of strong signatures due to the formation of mott domains in the energy measurements has been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that the appearance of mott domains is accompanied by minima in the release - energy curve as function of the on - site interaction parameter . here",
    ", we make a further step in this direction and provide a direct and quantitative connection between energy calculations and mott gaps , in presence of an external trap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] , we introduce the bose - hubbard model and describe the variational method , in section  [ sec : results ] , we present our results , and finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the bose - hubbard model which describes interacting bosons on a lattice  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 indicates nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) creates ( destroys ) a boson on site @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the local density operator .",
    "@xmath15 is the on - site interaction , @xmath16 is the hopping amplitude , and @xmath17 is a local energy offset due to an external trapping potential .    to study this model and describe its ground - state properties we use a mean - field approximation based on the gutzwiller ansatz  @xcite .",
    "this simple approach is able to capture important features of the true ground state and provides a qualitatively correct description of quantities such as the local density or the total energy , even in presence of spatial inhomogeneities  @xcite .",
    "more involved wave functions with a long - range jastrow factor  @xcite , or numerically exact calculations  @xcite may be considered , but a much larger computational effort would be required . instead , here we are just interested in showing that mott gaps can be extracted from the behavior of the release energy as a function of the total number of particles , and we do not expect qualitative differences when considering more accurate approaches .",

    "equivalently , the gutzwiller wave function can be introduced as the ground state of the following mean - field hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean - field potential which is self - consistently defined as @xmath30 ; it can be shown that @xmath26 is related to the ground - state eigenvector components of the converged solution of the local hamiltonian  ( [ meanfbose ] )  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is the chemical potential that fixes the number of bosons . in the recent past",
    ", the gutzwiller approach has been successfully used to study a wide range of bosonic systems , like for instance disordered potentials  @xcite , boson - boson mixtures  @xcite , and even time - dependent problems  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity and to simplify the presentation of the results , we first consider the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case , which is the limiting case where a collection of non - interacting tubes is created .",
    "an almost 1d model may be easily generated by using different lasers in the three different spatial directions and has been experimentally considered  @xcite .",
    "we mention that in 1d , within the gutzwiller approach , the compressible phase has inevitably a finite condensate fraction .",
    "however , this approach correctly reproduces the opening of the excitation gap at the mott transition ; therefore , the presence of a condensate does not imply relevant qualitative differences on the estimation of the gap with respect to an unbiased calculation .",
    "furthermore , we also report some results for two dimensions ( 2d ) for which we obtain similar conclusions .",
    "we emphasize that all the results remain valid in higher spatial dimensions because the superfluid to mott - insulator transition occurs in any dimension accompanied by the opening of a gap in the spectrum .",
    "we consider a lattice with a harmonic potential of the form @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the distance of site @xmath13 from the center of the lattice . in this case",

    "in both cases , we evaluate local quantities which allow us to determine whether a certain region across the lattice is in a compressible or incompressible state , as well as the release energy of the system .",

    "for the case with @xmath22 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : u4 ] ) there are no insulating phases , no matter what the number of bosons is .",
    "the density profile is smooth , with a broad maximum at the center of the trap . in this case , all regions of the lattice are ( locally ) compressible and , therefore , the ground state is gapless .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath40 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : u15 ] ) , where insulating regions are expected .",
    "indeed , what is found is the usual `` wedding - cake '' structure in the local density : the mott regions with integer @xmath19 and vanishing @xmath20 are surrounded by compressible regions which are locally gapless .",
    "we emphasize that the vanishing of @xmath20 is consequence of the gutzwiller approach ; in a more accurate description of a mott insulator , this quantity is indeed finite , though it is strongly reduced with respect to its value in the superfluid regions . here , the derivative of the release - energy curve clearly exhibits discontinuities that are reminiscent of the presence of a mott gap .",
    "this discontinuity takes place whenever a new compressible region appears at the center of the trap , on top of the underlying mott phase , see fig .",

    "the reduction of the measured gap comes from the fact that the release energy in the presence of the trap contains not only the information about the local creation of the new compressible region at the center of the trap , but also about all other sites of the lattice , which do not undergo the mott transition .",
    "therefore , the effect is spatially averaged over regions that are locally compressible and incompressible .",
    "nevertheless , the effect that originates from the central sites is visible and allows us to provide an estimate of the gap associated with such a transition .",

    "we find that , when the harmonic trap is increased , the mott gap saturates to @xmath56 , which is close to the value of the homogeneous system .",
    "the initial depletion of the mott gap as a function of @xmath57 is due to the presence of ( large ) regions of compressible sites close to the borders of the system ; by further increasing @xmath57 , these regions shrink and the gap eventually tends to approach the value of the uniform case .",

    "we stress that in presence of a diagonal confinement is such that compressible and incompressible regions coexist .",
    "indeed , the true gap of the overall confined system will be zero , as the global compressibility is always finite  @xcite .",

    "the advantage of this kind of confinement is that it is possible to have a mott - insulating phase throughout the whole lattice , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . by using the energy curve , we find that the value of the gap at @xmath46 is @xmath60 , remarkably close to the corresponding value in the homogeneous system ( @xmath61 ) but slightly larger .",
    "this is due to the fact that regions towards the border of the lattice are effectively in a deeper mott phase due to their reduced kinetic energy .",
    "away from integer densities , the system shows coexistence of compressible and incompressible states as in the harmonic confinement , with compressible sites always at the center of the trap and mott sites on the borders , again due to the reduced kinetic energy there .",
    "we have shown that relatively simple energy measurements may give important insights into the actual value of the mott gap .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the presence of the harmonic potential may renormalize the value of the gap with respect to the uniform case . on the other hand ,",
    "much closer results may be achieved when the off - diagonal confinement will be experimentally realized .",
    "although the experimental determination of the mott gap from release - energy curves may be difficult , since small error bar on both energies and particle numbers are required , we hope that in the near future this method will be successfully applied .",
