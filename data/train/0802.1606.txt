    "effective field theory ( eft ) approach , which shed new light on the methodology of nuclear physics , was used to reformulate the parity - violating ( pv ) nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) interaction recently,@xcite and the potential has been applied to a few two - nucleon problems.@xcite the pv two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) contribution to physical observables turned out to be non - negligible , but was not so significant as the tpe in the strong @xmath1 interaction .",
    "on the other hand , a pv @xmath1 contact term parametrized by a low - energy constant ( lec ) , which is presumed to subsume the heavy degrees of freedom and higher - order corrections , is comparable to the pv tpe contribution .",
    "more importantly , the lec term ( the contact term ) is highly singular at short distances and depends critically on the regularization methods and renormalization schemes . with the lack of experimental data to determine the lec value , it is not feasible to sharpen the theoretical prediction furthermore . as a partial resolution to the uncertainty associated with the lec term",
    ", we consider the covariant formulation of the pv tpe potential , which was already carried out in 1970s.@xcite compared to the tpe and lec terms in eft , the covariant formalism gives a potential which is finite and has no unknown constant .",
    "moreover , it is less singular at short distances than that from eft , and contains more higher - order @xmath2 contributions . in this work",
    "we focus on comparing the tpe potential from the covariant formalism with that from eft . by calculating a pv asymmetry in @xmath0 with these potentials",

    "the analysis will provide an indirect estimation of the correction due to the lec term in eft .",

    "[ table ]    in summary , the behavior of the potential at short distances and the pv asymmetry in @xmath38 show that the uncertainty due to the corrections from the degrees of freedom integrated out of the model is still significant , and it requires further investigation .",
    "however , the tpe and higher - order contributions to @xmath3 , in either covariant or eft form , gives a correction about 10  % at most .",
    "recent calculations of the @xmath44 resonance contribution to the pv potential in eft show that the present result of @xmath3 is not much affected by the @xmath45 contribution.@xcite to the extent investigated so far , @xmath3 is dominated by the pv ope potential with an uncertainty of about 10% at most .",
    "the precise measurement of @xmath3 will thus provide a unique opportunity to determine the value of @xmath14 .",
