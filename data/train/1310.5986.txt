    "<S> in an initially uncorrelated mixed separable bi - partite system , quantum correlations can emerge under the action of a local measurement or local noise @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze this counter - intuitive phenomenon using quantum discord as a quantifier . </S>",
    "<S> we then relate changes in quantum discord to system - environment correlations between the system in a mixed state and some purifying environmental mode using the koashi - winter inequality . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest an interpretation of discord as a byproduct of transferring entanglement and correlations around the different subsystems of a global pure state .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum discord is a measure of correlations in bi - partite systems that aims to capture more general signatures of quantumness in composite systems than entanglement and can be found even in systems in separable mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> these signatures are associated , for example , with the non - commutativity of quantum observables and with the fact that local measurements generally induce some disturbance on quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> much work has been done to determine how well these non - classical correlations represent a physical resource that can be used to improve upon classical performance . </S>",
    "<S> a great body of work has also been undertaken to better understand the nature of the non - classical correlations and the mechanisms through which these correlations manifest themselves .    in a recent publication by streltsov _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite , it has been shown that if two subsystems in mixed quantum states initially possess no quantum correlations , it is still possible to create non - classical correlations between them by performing a local ( quantum ) operation on one subsystem - a remarkable and counter - intuitive phenomenon . however , a clear insight into this mechanism can be gained if we incorporate the environment into the picture by , for example , exploring how the original bipartite system is coupled to an external quantum object representing the environment . </S>",
    "<S> we can then take a closer look at the behaviour of the non - classical correlations in what is now a pure tri - partite global quantum state .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum discord is a measure of the nonclassicality of correlations in a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 defined as a difference @xcite @xmath1 between the quantum generalizations of two classically equivalent expressions for the mutual information , namely the quantum mutual information @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the von neumann entropy , and the so called one - way classical correlation @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the conditional entropy of subsystem @xmath6 given that a positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) @xmath7 has been performed on subsystem @xmath8 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 $ ] are reduced states of subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath8 respectively , @xmath10/p_{b}(i)$ ] is the conditional state obtained upon detecting the povm element @xmath11 on @xmath8 and @xmath12 $ ] is the corresponding probability . </S>",
    "<S> the arrow in the notation indicates on which subsystem the povm is performed . </S>",
    "<S> subtracting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j ] ) from eq .  ( [ i ] ) one gets for the quantum discord the following formula : @xmath13 note that quantum discord is generally asymmetric under an exchange of the subsystems .    </S>",
    "<S> streltsov _ et al _ @xcite considered a maximally mixed two qubit state which for ease of notation we will denote @xmath14 and assume that the two marginal density matrices @xmath15 $ ] are held by alice and charlie . </S>",
    "<S> the initial state is described by @xmath16 which is clearly separable and exhibits no quantum correlations . a local measurement </S>",
    "<S> is then performed on charlie s subsystem yielding the state @xmath17 where @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this local operation has the effect of establishing non - zero quantum discord in one direction whilst leaving the quantum discord as zero in the other direction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath19 after the local operation on subsystem @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to consider why this result occurs for this mixed state by considering the state as part of a pure , global tri - partite state .    </S>",
    "<S> we first note that a mixed state is _ not _ a fundamental object . </S>",
    "<S> a mixed state is simply a sign of ignorance on the behalf of the observer . in the simplest case </S>",
    "<S> , an incoming qubit may interact with the system under consideration and then be lost . in the interaction process , correlations both classical and quantum will be formed between the studied system and the environment depending on the type of interaction . in actual fact , by trying to find a purification of the state under consideration , one is simply trying to account for any interactions with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> it does not matter if one qubit or more has interacted with the system - we combine all the environment qubits that ever were lost into another system @xmath8 , held by bob , represented by one qubit but conveying the statistical information of them all , such that @xmath21=\\hat{\\rho}_{ac}$ ] . in the example above  ( [ acin ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> one purification is given by the ghz state @xcite : @xmath22 which gives the mixed state of eq  ( [ acin ] ) after tracing out subsystem @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> as the global state is pure , the entropies are the same across any bi - partition , so @xmath23 initially , there is entanglement across each of the bipartitions of the ghz state as quantified by the entanglement of formation @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath25 if knowledge of any one of the three subsystems is missing ( any of the subsystems is traced out ) , there is no entanglement between the two remaining subsystems . however , _ classical _ correlations between those that remain are then maximal as quantified by the one way classical correlations @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 koashi and winter @xcite showed that , in any pure tripartite system , these quantities are intimately related as @xmath32 thus in a pure tripartite system , as a consequence of the above relations , if subsystem @xmath6 is maximally entangled with subsystem @xmath8 , then subsystem @xmath6 can not be even classically correlated with subsystem @xmath20 ( and vice versa ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , as koashi and winter discussed , the entropy of the marginal @xmath33 can be thought of as the capacity of alice s subsystem to form correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to our example and consider what must happen after a local measurement on @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> if alice had no knowledge of bob s or charlie s state , then the probability distribution yielded from her part of the state @xmath34 $ ] will stay unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , she implicitly averages over everything that could happen to states @xmath8 or @xmath20 by not knowing anything about them . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , after the measurement on subsystem @xmath20 , @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar argument holds for bob and so @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the purity must be preserved upon the measurement on any of the subsystems , @xmath37=\\textrm{tr}\\left[\\hat{\\rho}^2_{abc}\\right]=1 $ ] , provided nothing more is lost to further environment qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the only local distribution to be affected by the local measurement in this case is that of charlie s subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> after the local operation , the entropy of @xmath38 is given by : @xmath39-\\sqrt{2}\\coth^{-1}\\left[\\sqrt{2}\\right]}{\\ln\\left[4\\right ] } = = s^c_0.\\ ] ] the entropy of charlie s subsystem has decreased , @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the capacity of the quantum state that charlie holds to form correlations has decreased . </S>",
    "<S> as the state @xmath41 was initially separable from @xmath33 , a local operation on @xmath41 can not create entanglement between @xmath6 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this case , the only correlations that @xmath38 can form are classical , and they are weaker than before the measurement : @xmath42 however , alice and bobs local distributions remain unchanged - they can not change as they have never been interacted with . </S>",
    "<S> thus their respective capacities for forming correlations remain unchanged : @xmath43 and @xmath44 . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ entequ ] ) , this leaves @xmath45 unchanged .    the entanglement between subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath20 remains unchanged at zero , although the classical correlations between @xmath6 and @xmath20 as measured by @xmath46 and @xmath47 have decreased from unity to @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> feeding this into the koashi - winter relation : @xmath50 we can see that the remaining capacity for alice s correlations must be filled up to unity - by alice s state becoming entangled with bob s with @xmath51 .        </S>",
    "<S> in other words , a local operation on charlie s subsystem has preserved the purity of the global state , but decreased the entanglement across the @xmath52 bipartition , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement @xmath54 across the @xmath55 bipartition and @xmath56 across the @xmath57 partition remains the same . </S>",
    "<S> this results in reduced classical correlations between alice ( bob ) and charlie . however , the capacity of alice ( bob ) for forming correlations is unchanged so the consequence is that the subsystems of alice and bob become entangled . </S>",
    "<S> this is verified by direct calculation using the formula from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the discord between @xmath6 and @xmath20 arises as a side effect of this entanglement formation between the two subsystems that were not directly altered by the povm - the mutual information @xmath58 is reduced from 1 to @xmath49 but one - way classical correlations are decreased further . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath59    interestingly , we could think about this from the opposite perspective - as opposed to performing a local operation on @xmath20 we could perform a complementary non - local entangling operation directly on @xmath6 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , a local operation on @xmath20 that creates discord between @xmath6 and @xmath20 is _ equivalent _ to an entangling operation on @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the global state @xmath61 ( purification of the initial mixed state @xmath62 including environment @xmath8 ) is pure before and after the measurement : @xmath63 @xmath64 the initial transformation was of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 but could also be performed by a transformation @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 note , the transformations @xmath70 and @xmath71 are _ not _ unitary .    </S>",
    "<S> the above considerations unveil quantum discord as being not really a fundamental phenomenon but a side effect of all the changes in local entropy in a quantum system coupled to the environment . </S>",
    "<S> initially , there are only classical correlations across the ( @xmath6-@xmath20 ) bi - partition and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> if we incorporate the environment into the picture , the global pure tri - partite state is entangled ( but there is no entanglement across any of the bi - partitions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement destroys this entanglement redirecting the entropy flow and resulting in : ( 1 ) bi - partite entanglement between subsystem @xmath6 and part of enviroment @xmath8 ( purifying subsystem ) and ( 2 ) bi - partite quantum correlations between the separable subsystem @xmath6 and the measured subsystem @xmath20 resulting in non - zero quantum discord @xmath73 .    </S>",
