    "in the dynamics of relativity , the energy and momentum of a physical system is described by a lorentz four - tensor ; such a tensor is usually called _ energy  momentum tensor _ @xcite , _ stress tensor _ @xcite , _ stress  energy tensor _ @xcite , or _ momentum  energy stress tensor _ @xcite .",

    "we use this theorem to verify mller s theorem , surprisingly finding that mller s theorem is flawed .    like the four - vector theorem , a lorentz _ scalar _ theorem is a mathematical statement that under what conditions , the time - element space integral of a four - vector is a lorentz scalar . in ref.@xcite , a scalar theorem for a four - vector that is required to be time - independent is set up , called `` derivative von laue s theorem '' , and it is used to resolve the invariance problem of total electric charge in relativistic electrodynamics .    in this paper , we also provide a generalized lorentz scalar theorem for a four - vector that is not required to be time - independent and not required to be divergence - less .",

    "consider a four - vector , given by @xmath225 defined in the cubic domain @xmath176 , with @xmath226 holding except for some individual discrete points , and @xmath227 holding . according to theorem 3 ,",
    "@xmath228 is not a lorentz scalar , because @xmath229 for any @xmath215 .",
    "put it simply , for @xmath230 , @xmath231 is not a lorentz scalar . + from above example 1 and example 2 , we know that @xmath224 is a lorentz scalar for @xmath223 , and @xmath231 is not a lorentz scalar for @xmath230 .",
    "we have known that @xmath232 is a lorentz scalar for @xmath187 @xcite , while the counterexample of weinberg s claim tells us that @xmath233 is not a lorentz scalar for @xmath210 .",
    "thus we can generally conclude that whether the time - element space integral of a four - vector is a lorentz scalar has nothing to do with the four - vector s divergence - less property .",
    "the invariance problem of total electric charge has been resolved by using `` derivative von laue s theorem '' in ref.@xcite , which indicates that the invariance comes from two facts : ( a ) @xmath208 is a four - vector and ( b ) the moving velocity of any charged particles is less than vacuum light speed .",
    "this explanation removes the assumption that the total charge is an experimental invariant @xcite .",
    "the difference between the derivative von laue s theorem @xcite and theorem 3 is that the derivative von laue s theorem has a pre - assumption of @xmath234 , namely @xmath235 is not allowed to be time - dependent , while theorem 3 does not .",
    "for example , we also can use the derivative von laue s theorem @xcite to analyze the four - vector @xmath218 discussed above because @xmath236 holds , but we can not use it to analyze @xmath204 given by eq.([eq48 ] ) , because @xmath237 does not hold .",

    "based on theorem 3 , we have disproved weinberg s claim , and obtained a general conclusion for the lorentz property of a four - vector s time - element space integral ( see sec.[s4 ] ) .    we have shown that the sufficient condition of mller s theorem makes the time - column space integrals of a tensor be time - independent constants ; however , it is not a sufficient condition to make the integrals constitute a lorentz four - vector .",
    "the corrected mller s theorem has a limited application ; especially for an em stress - energy tensor , the corrected mller s theorem only defines a trivial zero four - vector .",
    "the generalized von laue s theorem , presented in ref.@xcite , has a pre - assumption that tensor @xmath166 is required to be time - independent @xmath238 .",
    "the corrected mller s theorem , provided in the present paper , also has a pre - assumption that tensor @xmath166 is required to be divergence - less @xmath239 and required to satisfy a zero boundary condition ( @xmath126 on boundary ) but @xmath166 is allowed to be time - dependent .",
    "compared with the generalized von laue s theorem and corrected mller s theorem , theorem 1 does not have any pre - assumption , while the three theorems have the same sufficient and necessary condition .",

    "there is a well - known result in the dynamics of relativity that if a lorentz four - vector is divergence - less ( _ conserved _ ) , then the time - element space integral of the four - vector is a lorentz scalar ; for example , weinberg claims that `` for any conserved four - vector '' , namely for any four - vector @xmath188 that satisfies conserved equation @xmath187 , @xmath240 `` defines a time - independent scalar '' @xcite , and mller also claims a proof of such a result in his textbook @xcite .",
