    "parity - violating ( pv ) nuclear force has been treated in the framework of one - meson - exchange model , known as the ddh potential  @xcite .",
    "however , recently the pv nuclear force was derived in an effective field theory ( eft ) of qcd up to one - loop order by considering two - pion - exchange contributions  @xcite . meanwhile , another version of eft , a pionless eft in which pions are regarded as a heavy degree of freedom and thus integrated out , has been demonstrated efficient for describing both parity - conserving ( pc ) ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) and pv nuclear few - body processes at very low energies .",
    "a pv two - nucleon process with a pionless theory was first studied by savage  @xcite .",
    "subsequently we have calculated pv observables in @xmath0 at threshold in the pionless eft  @xcite . in our previous works",
    ", we obtained a pv lagrangian employing di - baryon fields which represent two - nucleon @xmath1 and @xmath2 states .",
    "( a similar lagrangian was obtained independently in @xcite . )",
    "the weak @xmath3 interaction is described in terms of the pv di - baryon - nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) vertices , in which the two - nucleon s - wave states represented by the di - baryon fields make a transtion to the p - wave states represented by the two nucleon fields , whereas the interactions are assumed to have unknown weak @xmath4 coupling constants .",
    "recently we considered the neutron spin polarization @xmath5 along the direction @xmath6 in @xmath7 with the pionless eft @xcite , where @xmath8 refers to a polarized neutron .",
    "the neutron spin polarizations along the other directions @xmath9 and @xmath10 vanish with only the pc interactions , but they can be nonvanishing with the pv interactions .",
    "interference terms between pc and pv amplitudes can give non - zero contributions to the neutron spin asymmetries .",
    "here , we report on our calulation of the pv neutron spin asymmetry in @xmath11 process in terms of the undetermined pv coupling constants in the pionless eft .",
    "we investigate the energy dependence of the asymmetry @xmath12 at a few colatitude angles with the photon energies up to 30 mev .",
    "if measurements of the pv asymmetry can be made in future , we will be able to fix the undetermined pv coupling constants in the theory .",
    "a coefficient in an effective lagrangian , known as a low - energy constant ( lec ) , is assumed to include contributions from degrees of freedom that are integrated out of a theory . in the pionless theory , because even the pion is integrated out , an interaction is described only by the nucleon - nucleon contact terms with undetermined lecs . in the case of pionless theory with di - baryon fields , we assume that a pv @xmath4 vertex subsumes the pv @xmath3 interactions of the integrated - out degrees of freedom . introducing dimensionless pv lecs @xmath13 , we have a pv @xmath4 lagrangian for the @xmath14 part as  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are di - baryon fields ( effective ranges ) in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channel , respectively .",
    "spin - isospin operator @xmath20 with the operator ( @xmath21 ) in eq . ( 1 ) projects a two - nucleon system to @xmath22 state .",
    "the pv vertex given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) therefore generates a @xmath22 admixture in the @xmath23 state .",
    "similarly , @xmath24 with the operator ( @xmath21 ) in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is the projection operator for @xmath25 state , and thus the lagrangian mixes @xmath25 state with the @xmath26 state . for the @xmath27 part , we have @xmath28 admixture to the @xmath26 state , so the lagrangian reads @xmath29",
    "in figure 1 we show the leading - order diagrams for the pv @xmath11 process . from the sum of all the amplitudes , we can obtain the transition amplitudes involving the pv interactions .    for the polarization of the neutron along an axis @xmath30",
    ", we introduce the spin - isospin projection operator    @xmath31    inserting the projection operator in the spin - isospin summation of the squared amplitude , we obtain @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a symmetric factor @xmath34 . following the conventions given in @xcite",
    ", we have the incoming photons along @xmath35 , relative momentum of the nucleons along @xmath36 , and the neutron spin polarized along @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the interference terms of pc and pv amplitudes .",
    "because the explicit expressions of these quantities are lengthy , they will be given in a forthcoming article @xcite .",
    "the terms @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : squared - amplitude ] ) are the same as those in ref .",
    "the neutron spin asymmetry along the @xmath10 direction vanishes only with the pc interactions , but , as mentioned before , it can be nonvanishing in the presence of the pv interactions .",
    "we obtain the pv neutron spin asymmetry @xmath12 for @xmath48 as @xmath49    \\nonumber \\\\ & / &   \\bigg { [ } 4(|x_{ms}|^{2}+ |y_{mv}|^{2}-2y_{mv}rex_{ms } ) + 2(|x_{mv}|^{2}+ |y_{ms}|^{2}-2y_{ms}rex_{mv } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 3(1-\\cos^{2}{\\theta})(|x_{e}|^2+|y_{e}|^{2}-2x_{e}y_{e } ) \\bigg{]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 are the differential cross sections with the spin - isospin projection operators @xmath51 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows our results as functions of the photon energy @xmath52 at @xmath53 , 60@xmath54 , 90@xmath54 . because the lecs @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are not known yet",
    ", we can not determine the numerical values of @xmath12 at present .",
    "instead , we define @xmath58 , and fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 as functions of the photon energy .",
    "the angle dependence of the curves for @xmath60 and @xmath61 shows similar features ; as the angle increases , the dependence on the incoming photon energy becomes small .",
    "however , the curves of @xmath59 do not have angle dependence .",
    "this is because cancellations between e1 and m1 contributions make the result nearly angle independent .",
    "more detailed analysis will be reported in our forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "another notable point is that the magnitudes of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are similar in the energy range considered . in terms of ddh potential , @xmath62- and @xmath63-meson exchange interactions correspond to the vertices represented by the coupling constants @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and @xmath66-exchange interaction corresponds to @xmath67 .",
    "thus our results on @xmath12 in this work seem to suggest that the coefficients of the @xmath62- and @xmath63-meson exchange contributions will be similar to the ones by the @xmath66-exchange in the ddh potential . therefore the calculation with ddh",
    "potential will provide a counter check of the results in the present work .",
    "in this contribution , we have considered the @xmath7 process with the pionless eft employing the di - baryon fields .",
    "we have calculated the pv neutron spin asymmetry @xmath12 as a function of the photon energy up to 30  mev .",
    "our results could be useful to fix the pv @xmath4 lecs appearing in the pionless pv lagrangian .",
