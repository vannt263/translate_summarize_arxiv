    "spin glasses ( sg ) are disordered magnetic alloys.@xcite their microscopic modelization includes several interactions , such as the rkky interaction that is invariant over rotations,@xcite and the dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction that breaks the rotational symmetry.@xcite therefore , in theoretical physics sgs are often studied with simplified models that take in account only a few essential characteristics ( in particular , quenched disorder and symmetries).@xcite    the dm interaction , through a spin - orbit coupling with a third spin , causes the interactions between spins in any sg to have a certain degree of random anisotropy .",
    "this implies that real sgs are never fully isotropic ( this theoretical limit is named heisenberg sg ) .",
    "in fact , materials are classified according to the degree of anisotropy in their interactions,@xcite which turns out to be relevant in their non - equilibrium magnetic response.@xcite on one end of the materials spectrum we find the extremely anisotropic fe@xmath1mn@xmath1tio@xmath2 , which is maybe the best realization of the ideal limit of an ising sg ( ising sgs correspond to the idealization of uniaxial spins ) . on the other end",
    ", we have very isotropic alloys such as agmn or cumn ( whose modelization is notoriously difficult,@xcite due to the presence of short range spin - density wave ordering@xcite ) .",
    "despite the variety of interactions , already in the early 90s there was general experimental agreement on that sgs undergo a phase transition at sufficiently low temperature .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , theoretical work was less advanced , even though one works with extremely simple models . for the ising sg",
    "there were arguments supporting the existence of a phase transition,@xcite that were later confirmed numerically.@xcite in the heisenberg case , instead , all the attempts carried out during the 80s and 90s failed in finding a phase transition at a finite temperature @xmath3.@xcite in fact , matsubara et al . argued in 1991 that once a small anisotropic term is added to the heisenberg hamiltonian the phase transition becomes visible.@xcite this was in agreement with a later domain - wall computation.@xcite the accepted picture at the time was that the lower critical dimension ( i.e. the spatial dimension below which there is no phase transition ) lies somewhere between 3d and 4d.@xcite    however , the story was slightly more complicated .",
    "villain and coworkers made a provocative suggestion hypothesizing that , although maybe there was no spin glass transition , a different order parameter called chirality ( or vorticity ) could be critical.@xcite chirality is a scalar observable that describes vorticity and alignment between neighboring spins ( see below the precise definition in sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "this idea was elaborated by kawamura in his 1992 _ spin - chirality decoupling scenario : _ in the ideal case of a purely isotropic system the spin and chiral glass order parameters would be decoupled , but the introduction of any small anisotropy would couple them.@xcite    kawamura s scenario was apparently consistent with all the observations until 2003 , when lee and young employed more efficient simulation algorithms and finite - size scaling techniques to show that the spin glass channel is critical also in the fully isotropic model ( i.e. the heisenberg limit).@xcite both order parameters seemed to become positive at the same temperature .",
    "further simulations confirmed the existence of a spin glass phase transition , although uncertainty remains on whether the transition is unique @xcite or chiralities order at a slightly higher temperature @xmath4.@xcite    a parallel issue is measuring the chiral order parameter in experiments .",
    "kawamura proposed in 2003 that the extraordinary hall resistivity is a simple function of the linear and non - linear chiral - glass ( cg ) susceptibilities.@xcite experiments based on this proposal observed the chiral transition and measured , for instance , the critical exponent @xmath5.@xcite interestingly enough , the value of @xmath5 turned out to be compatible between spin and chiral glass sector",
    ". nonetheless , it was impossible to identify a universality class despite the critical exponents of these systems had been extensively measured ( at least in the sg sector):@xcite the impression was that they change in a continuous way from the heisenberg to the ising limit , @xcite as we increased the anisotropy .    however , analogy with ferromagnetic materials suggests a different interpretation .",
    "anisotropy would be a relevant parameter in the sense of the renormalization group.@xcite there should be a new dominant fixed point , and symmetry considerations lead to think it should belong to the ising - edwards - anderson universality class . yet , when we add a relevant parameter to the hamiltonian , there should be some _ cross - over _ effects .",
    "in other words , one expects that while the correlation length @xmath6 is small , the critical exponents are closer to the heisenberg - edwards - anderson universality class , and that only for large enough @xmath6 the universality class reveals its nature .",
    "notwithstanding , it is very hard , both numerically and experimentally , to prepare a sg with a large correlation length , since one should wait very long times ( it has been argued that the waiting time @xmath7 required to reach a certain coherence length is proportional to almost its seventh power , see e.g. refs . and ) . to our knowledge , for this reason , the largest measured correlation lengths are of the order of only one hundred lattice spacings .",
    "@xcite that is a rather small distance to reveal the true universality class , so it is plausible that experiments will find critical exponents between the two universality classes .    to further complicate things , in experiments one has to take in account at least two relevant crossovers .",
    "the first is the competition , that we just pointed out , between the isotropic and the anisotropic fixed points .",
    "it is the one we treat in this paper .",
    "the second crossover , that we will not address , is about short versus long range interactions .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian we treat is short range , but the dm interaction has been shown to be quasi - long - range , in the sense that the interactions are long range , but only until a cut - off distance of the order of some tens of atomic spacings .",
    "@xcite    aiming to untangle these questions , one of the authors undertook a numerical study of heisenberg sgs with very weak random anisotropies , @xcite but the scenario remained even more foggy , since it was observed that :    * the chiral glass critical temperature @xmath8 was significantly higher than @xmath9 , in disagreement with experiments and expectations .",
    "* apparently , the chiral susceptibility was _ not _ divergent at @xmath4 .",
    "this is surprising and , apparently , in contrast with experiments .",
    "@xcite technically , this lacking divergence appeared as a very large anomalous dimension @xmath10 . @xcite * introducing very weak anisotropies changed dramatically @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the @xmath9 found by comparing systems of size @xmath11 was about twice its equivalent on the fully isotropic model .",
    "this is surprising , since one expects that the critical temperature would change very little from the isotropic case when @xmath12 is as small as in ref . .",
    "in this paper we will focus on the uniqueness of the phase transition and on the universality class , proposing that there is a unique transition , belonging to the ising - edwards - anderson ( iea ) universality class.@xcite we will also give an interpretation to the results of ref .",
    ", showing that the apparent inconsistencies are due to scaling corrections , that we will try to characterize , since we believe them to be fundamental both in the interpretation of numerical simulations and of experiments .    to do all this , we will study numerically the heisenberg spin glass model with strong random anisotropies , in order to suppress both finite - size effects , and traces of the cross - over from the isotropic limit .",
    "we simulated on the largest lattices to present ( up to @xmath13 ) , over a wide temperature range.@xcite this has been possible thanks to an intense use of graphic accelerators ( gpus ) for the computations .",
    "we made use of the _ tianhe-1a _ gpu cluster in tianjin , china,@xcite and of the _ minotauro _ gpu cluster in barcelona.@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we give an explicit definition of the model , and we introduce the observables we extracted from simulations and analysis .",

    "there is quenched disorder , this means that the time scales of the couplings @xmath26 are infinitely larger than those of our dynamic variables , so we represent them as constant in time random variables , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 the overline @xmath30 denotes the averages over the instances of the disorder , while for thermal averages we will use @xmath31 .",
    "each different realization of the couplings @xmath26 is called _",
    "sample_. independent systems with the same couplings are _ replicas _ of the same sample .",
    "we use two replicas per sample .",
    "notice that if all the matrix elements @xmath32 are zero we recover the fully isotropic heisenberg model , with @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "however , if the @xmath32 are non - vanishing , the only remaining symmetry is time - reversal : @xmath34 for all the spins in the lattice .",
    "time reversal is an instance of the @xmath35 symmetry .",
    "this is the symmetry group of the iea model.@xcite hence , we expect that the @xmath35 symmetry will be spontaneously broken in a unique phase transition belonging to the iea universality class ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "of course , underlying this expectation is the assumption that the anisotropic coupling is a relevant perturbation in the renormalization group sense ( as it is the case in ferromagnets  @xcite ) . in fact , the infinite - anisotropy limit can be explicitly worked out for a problem with _ site _",
    "anisotropy [ rather than link anisotropy as in eq .  ]",
    ": one finds an iea - like behavior.@xcite    it is widely accepted that the universality class does not change with the probability distribution of the couplings.@xcite we take advantage of this , and choose a bimodal distribution for @xmath20 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these couplings can be stored in a single bit , which is important because we are using gpus , special hardware devices where memory read / write should be minimized ( appendix  [ sec : numericaldetails ] ) .",
    "we chose the two different values @xmath39 . we want to compare our results with those in ref . , where simulations were done on samples with weak random anisotropies . in that work",

    "the behavior is very different between the two cases .",
    "for strong anisotropies , the critical temperatures tend to meet as we increase @xmath16 .",
    "that is qualitatively very different from the weak anisotropy case , where their distance increases .",
    "we can ask ourselves where this qualitative difference of behavior comes from .",
    "if we compare same system sizes and different @xmath12 in table [ tab : tcg ] , we notice that finite - size effects are larger ( and @xmath79 closer to two ) the smaller the anisotropy .",
    "these differences in the finite - size effects are appreciable with a factor 2 change in the anisotropy ( from @xmath65 to @xmath58 ) , so it is reasonable that suppressing the anisotropy by a factor 17 or 35 will increase drastically the finite - size effects .",
    "the most economic explanation is then that there is a non - asymptotic effect that disappears with much larger systems or , as we have seen , with larger anisotropies .",
    "in other words there is a @xmath80 after which @xmath9 and @xmath4 start joining . for @xmath78",
    ", @xmath81 is so large that we observe a growing @xmath82 , while for @xmath83 we find @xmath84 .    another peculiarity outcoming from ref",
    ". arises from the sg transition alone .",
    "it had been observed that a very weak perturbation on the symmetry of the isotropic system implied huge changes in the critical temperature , while one would expect that the transition line is smooth .    to solve this dilemma , we take advantage of having strong evidence for the universality class of the transition .",
    "so , we take the data from ref . , and use once again the exponents @xmath71 and @xmath70 in ref . to extrapolate the infinite volume limit with second order corrections to scaling ( eq . [ eq : scalingcorrections ] ) .",
    "the fit is good ( @xmath85 ) , and , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsg_d003 ] , its @xmath68 extrapolation for the critical temperature is compatible with @xmath86 within one standard deviation .",
    "thus , taming the finite - size effects was enough to make the scenario consistent , and the issue reduces to the fact that finite - size effects are extremely strong when the anisotropy is smaller .",

    "we performed a numerical study of the critical behavior of heisenberg spin glasses with strong bimodal anisotropies .",
    "our aim was to clarify the role of scaling - corrections , as well as the crossover effects between the heisenberg and ising universality classes , to be expected when the anisotropic interactions are present .",
    "in fact , we show that anisotropic interactions are a relevant perturbation in the renormalization group sense : no matter how small the anisotropy , the asymptotic critical exponents are those of the ising - edwards - anderson model . however , a fairly large correlation length maybe needed to reach the asymptotic regime .",
    "this observation is relevant for the interpretation of both numerical simulations,@xcite and experiments.@xcite    it is then clear that large system sizes are needed to make progress , something that calls for extraordinary simulation methods .",
    "therefore , we performed single - gpu and multi - gpu simulations to thermalize lattices up to @xmath13 at low temperatures .",
    "as side benefit , our work provides a proof - of - concept for gpu and multi - gpu massive simulation of spin - glasses with continuous degrees of freedom .",
    "this topic is elaborated further in appendix  [ sec : numericaldetails ] .",
    "we performed a finite - size scaling analysis based on phenomenological renormalization.@xcite we imposed scale - invariance on the second - moment correlation length in units of the system size , @xmath92 .",
    "we followed this approach for both the chiral and spin glass order parameters .",
    "our results for the spin - glass sector were crystal clear : all the indicators of the universality class were compatible with their counterparts in the ising - edwards - anderson model . on the other hand , in the chiral sector scaling - corrections were annoyingly large , despite they decrease upon increasing the magnitude of the anisotropic interactions .    regarding the coupling of chiral and spin glass transition , our numerical results seem to indicate that the two phase - transitions take place at the same temperature ( i.e. @xmath93 )",
    "however , it is important to stress that we need our very largest lattices to observe this trend .",
    "nevertheless , what we see is in agreement with both kawamura s prediction and experiments , where the phase transitions are apparently coupled , and the chiral glass susceptibility is divergent.@xcite    moreover , we were able to rationalize the numerical results in ref .   with corrections to scaling , by assuming the ising - edwards - anderson universality class .",
    "we remark that there are strong analogies between the interpretation of numerical and experimental data . in both cases",
    ", there is a relevant length - scale ( the correlation length for experiments , the system size for simulations ) .",
    "if that length is large enough , the asymptotic ising - edwards - anderson universality class should be observed . otherwise , intermediate results between heisenberg and ising are to be expected , and indeed appear.@xcite    the difficulty in reaching the asymptotic regime lies on time : the time growth of the correlation length is remarkably slow ( @xmath94 with @xmath95,@xcite where @xmath7 is the waiting time ) .",
    "indeed , the current experimental record is around @xmath96 100 lattice spacings,@xcite pretty far from the thermodynamic limit.@xcite hence attention should shift to the study of the intermediate cross - over regime .",
    "an intriguing possibility appears : one could envisage an experimental study of the crossover effects as a function of the _ waiting time_. in fact , @xmath97 varies some four orders of magnitude in current experiments,@xcite which should result in a factor 4 variation of @xmath98 .",

    "it actually mimics the natural evolution followed by real spin glasses ( that never reach equilibrium near or below the critical temperature ) . for this reason we enhance it with two more algorithms .",
    "however , heat - bath does play a crucial role , since it is irreducible ( i.e. the full configuration space is reachable , at least in principle ) , at variance with overrelaxation , which keeps the total energy constant , and parallel - tempering , which changes the temperature but not the spin configuration .",
    "crucial to perform the heat - bath and overrelaxation dynamics is a factorization property of the boltzmann weight for the hamiltonian  .",

    "also , due to the fact that the lattice positions were evaluated with bitwise operations , and to our coalesced memory - reading scheme , @xcite our program was mostly efficient when the size of the lattice was a power of two , so we favored simulations on those sizes .      for @xmath13 and @xmath58",
    "the relaxation times were too long to be able to thermalize on a single gpu .",
    "therefore , we prepared a code that mixed cuda and mpi , in order to be able to concentrate a major computing capability on a single sample .",
    "we took advantage of the two levels of parallelization that our update algorithms allow .",
    "we used @xmath110 gpus , each updating only two independent lattices with the same couplings , but not necessarily with the same temperature . at the level of the single gpu ,",
    "the way we swept the lattice with heat - bath and overrelaxation was similar to the single - gpu version .",
    "yet , we had to arrange it in order to get the same thread occupancy as in the single - gpu version .",
    "our choice has been to divide the lattice in rows of 8 spins along the @xmath111 axis .",
    "non - neighboring rows were updated at the same time .",
    "a side advantage of this scheme was that we could use for it the same type of coalesced memory reading that we developed for the single - gpu lattice sweeping .",
    "this arrangement resulted in an extremely small overhead when passing from the single to the multiple - gpu algorithm .",
    "we were also favored by other factors .",
    "parallel tempering only requires the exchange with the master of a double precision number .",
    "also , the long correlation times allow to take measurements with low frequency . as a consequence of all this",
    ", we obtained a linear scaling of the computing time with the number of gpus , @xmath105 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scalinggpu ] ) .",
    "pseudo - random number generators ( prngs ) are a critical issue in the implementation of stochastic algorithms , @xcite but even more in cases like ours , where each of the @xmath112 threads had to carry its own prng , and we had a large number of them acting in parallel on the same lattice .",
    "this became a major problem especially in the simulations with mpi , where a huge number of prngs was concentrated on only two lattices .",
    "it was crucial to guarantee the statistical independence of the @xmath112 pseudo - random sequences .",
    "we consider three different aspects : ( @xmath44 ) the prng that each thread uses , ( @xmath45 ) the initialization of the generators and ( @xmath113 ) our tests on the generators .        with the parisi - rapuano sequence , @xcite the @xmath114 pseudo - random number @xmath115",
    "is generated through the following relations : @xmath116 where xor is the exclusive or logic operator , and @xmath117 are 64-bit unsigned integers .",
    "although some pathologies have been found in the 32-bit parisi - rapuano prng,@xcite it looks like its 64-bit version is solid .",
    "@xcite    on the other side , we used a 64-bit congruential generator , where the @xmath114 element of the sequence , @xmath118 , was given by:@xcite @xmath119 also this generator is not reliable when used alone.@xcite        we have found that problems arise if special care is not devoted to the initialization of the random numbers .",
    "this is particularly important in the case of multiple gpus where @xmath122 threads concurrently update the spins in only two lattices .",
    "we decided to use one seed per node .",
    "this seed was used to initialize a 64-bit congruential prng , eq .  .",
    "we employed it to initialize the state vector of 24-bit luescher prng.@xcite the 24-bits words were obtained from three consecutive congruential calls ( we kept the most significant byte from each call ) . as for the luescher generator , we employed the _ full luxury _ version , which is fireproof but slow .",
    "we took the 8 most significant bits from each luescher call to fill up the state vector of the 64-bit prngs in eq .",
    "we were probably excessively cautious , given the high quality of the full - luxury generator , but initialization takes only a small fraction of the total computing time .",
    "we tested with success our random sequences through the whole battery of tests proposed by marsaglia in ref .  .",
    "to be sure the sequences were reliable also with concurrent threads , we also generated @xmath112 sequences and tested them _ horizontally _ , i.e. taking first the first number of each sequence , then the second , and so on .      finally , it has been pointed out that local schwinger - dyson relations ( see e.g. ref . ) can be useful to assess the quality of prngs.@xcite the relevant identity here is @xmath124 we averaged it over all the sites in the lattice , in order to obtain a more stringent test for the simulations .",
    "of course the limiting factor is in the wide range of _ relaxation times , _ rather than temperatures .",
    "however , relaxation times depend on a variety of implementation - dependent factors ( such as the temperature spacing in the parallel tempering , or the number of overrelaxation sweeps ) .",
    "hence , comparison with other work will be easier in terms of temperatures .            independence from microscopic details such as the disorder distribution has been found for spin glasses,@xcite as well as for other disordered systems like the random field ising model,@xcite or disordered ferromagnets ( either site  @xcite or bond  @xcite diluted ) .                                          a more recent yet unpublished article from the janus collaboration ( ref .  ) gives a more precise determination of the critical exponents .",
    "using one or the other does not change significantly our results and conclusions .",
    "janus collaboration : m. baity - jesi , r. a. baos , a. cruz , l. a. fernandez , j. m. gil - narvion , a. gordillo - guerrero , d. iiguez , a. maiorano , f. mantovani , e. marinari , v. martin - mayor , j. monforte - garcia , a. muoz sudupe , d. navarro , g. parisi , s. perez - gaviro , m. pivanti , f. ricci - tersenghi , j. j. ruiz - lorenzo , s. f. schifano , b. seoane , a. tarancon , r. tripiccione , d. yllanes , phys . rev .",
    "b ( in press , see arxiv:1310.2910 ) .    some of the points we used for those extrapolations shared some of the data .",
    "for example , the crossing of @xmath6 for @xmath128 , had in common the points from size @xmath129 with the pair @xmath130 .",
    "hence , in the fits we have taken in account the covariance matrix that gave a measure of the anticorrelation between measures that share data .      in the phase diagram",
    "we show , the @xmath77 point comes from ref . , where chiral and spin glass transition are assumed to be coupled .",
    "there is disagreement on whether @xmath72 also in the isotropic case .",
    "yet , we do plot it as a single transition because although @xmath9 might be lower than @xmath4 , their best estimates are compatible ( and not distinguishable in the plot ) ."
