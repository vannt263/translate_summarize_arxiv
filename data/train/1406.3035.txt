    "triple systems are some of the most frequent astrophysical phenomena , manifesting themselves in almost any given scale ; where triple stars , planets in binaries , and even our own sun - earth - moon system serve as a few obvious examples .",
    "about 15 % of all stars reside in triples ( @xcite ; and possibly@xmath050 ( 40 ) % for more massive o / b stars ; @xcite ; s. de - mink , private communication , 2014 ) .",
    "some aspects of the rich and complex gravitational dynamics of such systems have been studied extensively ( as evidenced by the well known three body problem ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , study of the realistic evolution of such systems , including the coupling of their dynamics with non - gravitational processes and/or the realistic treatment of the physical properties such as mass loss and mass transfer is still in its infancy . given the mounting evidence for the importance of such systems , and their ubiquity in stellar and planetary systems , our poor understanding of these systems is quite disconcerting .",
    "here we explore the secular dynamics of evolving triples , and in particular the effects of mass - loss and mass - transfer on the dynamical evolution of triples .",
    "stable triple systems are hierarchical , namely , consists of an inner binary and an outer binary orbit , i.e. the tertiary ( third object ) . secular evolution of such systems is the change of _ orbital elements _ on timescale much larger than the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "triple stellar evolution processes , i.e. mass loss , mass transfer , tidal friction , gravitational wave emission , etc .",
    "influence the orbital elements through changes in energy and angular momentum .",
    "hence , in order to understand triple stellar evolution one should couple the secular dynamics and the evolutionary processes to get a complete and more comprehensive picture .",
    "several astrophysical phenomena are likely to be produce via triple interaction and evolution .",
    "key dynamical long term effect is the lidov - kozai mechanism @xcite , in which perturbations by the third outer companion lead to periodic / quasi - periodic ( and sometime chaotic ; @xcite ) large amplitude oscillations ( sometime called kozai - cycles ) of the mutual inclination of the inner and outer binary in the triple , as well as the inner binary eccentricity .",
    "this secular effect , first introduced in the context of solar system bodies , have been since suggested to play an important role over a wide range of systems and scales , from the dynamics of super - massive black holes and stars to exoplanets , moons and planetesimals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the basic effect of the kozai cycle is that on time scale much larger than the orbits periods , the inner orbit eccentricity and relative inclination fluctuate due to mutual torque between the inner and outer binaries . as a result ,",
    "orbits exchange angular momentum ( but not energy ) and become more eccentric , possibly to the point in which physical collisions / mergers , tidal friction , gravitational wave emission and/or other short range effects become important . in the following",
    "we consider all the system components to be point like mass particles ; the coupling of tidal effects and/or mergers / collisions where the physical size plays a role will be explored elsewhere .",
    "the analysis of secular processes make use of the mass averaging technique ; the masses of the triple components are averaged - out over the inner and outer binaries orbital periods , and the dynamics then follow the mutual torques of these mass - averaged rings , using a perturbative expansion . for a very low - mass secondary in the inner binary ( the test - particle regime ) using expansion terms up to the quadruple level",
    "is sufficient to describe its evolution ( e.g. for the cases of a star - planet - comet or a star - planet - moon systems ; @xcite ) .",
    "the quadruple expansion is also sufficient in symmetric cases , where the primary and secondary in the inner binary have equal masses and the octupole expansion term becomes negligible ( see later section for quantitative description ) .",
    "octupole expansion treatment exhibits features lacking in the quadrupole analysis .",
    "in particular , system with no inner binary symmetry in mass i.e. @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the masses of the inner binary @xcite .",
    "octupole level dynamical treatment covers a wider range of systems , but it becomes inaccurate once the triple hierarchy is weaker , i.e. the timescales for the third body perturbation during periastron passage becomes comparable to the dynamical timescale of the inner binary , and the secular averaging approach is no longer valid @xcite .",
    "each one of these approaches is also characterized by a different dynamical behavior , from a periodical behavior in the quadrupole regime , to a quasi - periodic and chaotic behavior at the octupole and the non - secular regime .    in the following we use the secular approach to explore mass transfer and mass loss processes in triple systems .",
    "this approach is valid as long as the mass - loss / transfer processes occur on long enough timescales , such that the changes in angular momentum / energy on dynamical timescales are small ; prompt mass - loss processes such as supernovae explosions are therefore not studied here .",
    "this is done by adding the appropriate terms for mass loss and mass transfer to the secular equations of motion at the octupole level , as well as using direct n - body integration to validate our secular analysis . as we show",
    ", such processes can change the dynamical regime characterizing the system , and thereby lead to significant changes in the system behavior .",
    "we focus only on mass - loss induced transitions in the secular regimes ( see also an n - body study of such transitions by @xcite ) ; discussion of mass - loss induced transition from the secular regime to non - secular or even unstable triple regime is discussed elsewhere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in the following we first briefly present the analytic treatment for the long term , secular evolution of the hierarchical triple systems following previous studies @xcite .",
    "these provide the basis for the secular evolution approach , which we then extended to include mass - loss and mass - transfer processes .",
    "we use time - independent hamiltonian perturbation theory and expand it up to the third , octupole order .",
    "one can treat an hierarchical triple as two weakly interacting kepler orbits , an inner orbit and an outer orbits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : heirarchichal - theree - body ] ) together with a weak interaction term .",

    "the short timescale is the inner and outer orbit period , the long timescale is the timescale for the change in the orbital elements .",
    "the timescale difference enables us to average over the short timescales and obtain a much simpler hamiltonian , and hence simpler set of the equations of motion .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ouctopole hamiltonian ] ) contains information about the long and short time behavior of the system .",

    "let us now define @xmath95 which measures the importance of the octupole terms , @xmath96 .",
    "note that in this approximation the energy for the inner and outer orbits are conserved , respectively ; namely @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and similarly the total angular momentum @xmath99 .",
    "hence , the interaction only involves exchanging angular momentum between the two orbits .",
    "we obtain the equations of motion of the orbital elements . as can be seen the secular evolution , as described by the quadruple level equations , gives rise to an oscillatory behavior , where both the eccentricity and the inclination of the inner binary periodically change with a potentially large amplitude ; these are termed kozai - lidov oscillations / cycles @xcite which have been discussed extensively in the past recent years .",
    "the characteristic timescale of a full kozai cycle is given by @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the period time of the inner binary and @xmath102 is the period time of the outer binary .",
    "the maximum inner eccentricity during a cycle is given by @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the initial inclination between the inner and outer binary in the triple ( assuming an initial circular orbit ) .",
    "in the octupole regime , an additional , long term low frequency modulation can be seen on a different timescale ( see section [ sub : timescales ] ) . in particular , in this regime the system evolution is much more complex , and it is not periodic on the long term",
    ". moreover , the amplitude of the changes in the inclinations and eccentricities could be much larger . in this regime transitions between prograde and retrograde orbits due to extremely high eccentricities",
    "can also occur .",
    "the latter effect becomes highly important when discussing realistic non - point particles , where close encounters between the inner triple components can lead to significant orbital changes through the coupling of short - range dissipative processes .",
    "making use of the secular formulation for the evolution of classical point - like particles described above , we are now ready to take the next step , and couple the triple dynamics with dissipative and non - classical processes .",
    "the secular classical point - particle dynamics of the triple systems described above conserve energy , and therefore the smas of the system remain constant throughout their evolution , @xmath105 , @xmath106 . in the following subsections general relativistic ( gr ) interaction ,",
    "mass loss and mass transfer processes are described . in a realistic triple system",
    "these effects are important and influence the equation of motion . in section [ sub : post - newtonian - terms ]",
    "we consider the general relativistic effects on the equation of motion , and in section [ sec : secular - evolution - with - massloss ] we added our novel treatment for the mass loss and mass transfer processes .",
    "general relativity plays a key role in close compact systems .",
    "these post newtonian effects come in two separate manifestations , both are taken into account only for the inner binary , gr effects on the outer binary are typically insignificant in comparison , besides the cases of weakly hierarchical systems , where the secular approach becomes invalid ; in the following gr effects on the external binary are neglected ( for treatment of such systems see @xcite ) .    the first post newtonian effect included is the precession of periastron ( not a dissipative effect but rather an additional dynamical process ) , and the second is gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation ( which is a dissipative process ) .",
    "for the former , hamiltonian analytic treatment can be used @xcite , by adding the averaged post newtonian hamiltonian to the averaged hamiltonian described in section [ sub : secular - dynamics ] @xmath107\\ ] ] @xmath108\\ ] ] @xmath109.\\label{eq : post newtonian hamltonian}\\ ] ] from this hamiltonian one obtains the additional term for the precession of the inner binary @xmath110 for the gravitational wave treatment one can follow @xcite and compute the loss of energy , angular momentum and the change in eccentricity , averaged per orbit , and add the appropriate terms to the hamiltonian equations .",

    "we present the different timescales of the dynamical problem at hand .",
    "the short time scales of the system are the inner and outer binary periods , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively . using the double averaging method we effectively assume no variation occurs on these ( or shorter ) time scales .",
    "the next timescale corresponds to the quadrupole term , which gives rise to the `` standard '' kozai cycling .",
    "its characteristic time scale is @xmath117 .",
    "more specifically , the timescale is @xcite @xmath118    the timescale corresponding to the octupole level perturbations has the form of @xmath119 and the explicit term is @xmath120 the long term modulation of the standard kozai cycles occurs on this timescale .",
    "an additional important timescale is that arising from gr effects , the time scales corresponding to the different post - newtonian terms , which has two manifestations .",
    "the first is the precession time scale of the inner binary , and the second it the gw radiation time scale from the inner binary . for the gr precession time scale @xmath121 which corresponds to the time the ellipse makes a complete revolution due to gr precession ( @xmath122 stands for the first post - newtonian term ) .",
    "the gw timescale is @xmath123 where @xmath124 stands for the @xmath125 post - newtonian term .",
    "the physical meaning of this post newtonian term is the timescale for orbital energy loss due to gw emission , which could , eventually lead to the inner binary merger .",
    "equipped with all the necessary equations arising from the gravitational dynamics , we now continue to add relevant terms arising from the evolutionary processes of mass - loss and mass - transfer to the equations of motion .",
    "in this section we treat the secular evolution equations of motion with mass loss . for a single star ,",
    "mass loss rate vary on a wide range , from @xmath126 to @xmath127 , depending on stellar mass , evolutionary stage and the mass loss mechanism , e.g. a supernova ( sn ) explosion causes prompt mass loss , and a common envelope ( cm ) stage in a binary system expel up to a few solar mass per year .",
    "mass loss is therefore an important evolutionary effect for single , binary and triple stellar evolution . here",
    "we treat only secular mass - loss / mass - transfer processes , which are defined as slow changes in mass , with respect to the orbital period , namely @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the total mass of a given mass - losing binary system . for simplicity",
    "we assume secular mass loss of mass @xmath2 in the inner binary of the form @xmath130 where @xmath7 is an arbitrary function satisfying ( [ eq : adiabatic condition ] ) .",
    "the corrected equations of motion are presented for this case ; a complete treatment for mass loss from both the inner and outer binary is presented the end of this section . for secular mass loss in a binary , the sma and the eccentricity evolve according the following equations of motion @xmath131 @xmath132 where ml refers to mass loss @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an additional term in ( [ eq : a1 -correction ] ) @xmath133 and a similar change in @xmath6 , which was originally a constant of motion , in the absence of mass loss processes @xmath134    the rate of change of the orbital angular momentum @xmath36 with mass loss is given by differentiating ( [ eq : g1-g2-definition ] ) with respect to time @xmath135 and the outer angular momentum @xmath37 follows @xmath136 these additional terms change only in magnitude and not in direction .",
    "note the angular momentum _ per unit",
    "mass _ is conserved ; hence at the _ test particle limit _ , the angular momentum itself would also be conserved .",
    "the total angular momentum change within one orbital period time , due to the mass loss in the inner binary , is given by differentiating ( [ eq : h - definition ] ) * @xmath137 * the change in the total angular momentum @xmath35 effects ( [ eq : h1-eom ] ) and ( [ eq : h2-eom ] ) .",
    "therefore one needs to recalculate the rate of change of @xmath38 and @xmath39 . taking the time derivatives of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h1-geometry ] ) and ( [ eq : h2-geometry ] ) adds an additional term proportional to @xmath138 @xmath139    @xmath140    in the general case where all three objects losses mass @xmath141 @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are arbitrary functions satisfying ( [ eq : adiabatic condition ] ) , the additional terms added to the inner and outer angular momentum ( [ eq : g1-eom ] ) , ( [ eq : g2_ml ] ) are @xmath145    @xmath146    @xmath147    and the changes in the smas of the inner and outer orbits are : @xmath148    @xmath149    the functions @xmath150 and @xmath144 usually obtained from stellar evolution codes or analytic approximations .",
    "in order to account for mass - transfer between the triple components , we also need to introduce efficiency parameters @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "these correspond to the efficiency of mass transfer in a given binary sub - system in the triple : @xmath151 is the efficiency of the mass transfer from @xmath2 to @xmath154@xmath152 is the efficiency of the mass transfer from @xmath3 to @xmath2 and @xmath153 is the efficiency of the mass transfer from @xmath8 to the inner binary .",
    "it is important to note that throughout our modeling of the mass transfer we assume no angular momentum exchange , beside that arising directly from the mass changes ; i.e. we assume mass `` disappears '' from one object and `` reappears '' in another .",
    "we can then obtain the following general set of equations which can also account for mass transfer @xmath155 @xmath156 note that the last term in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m0_dot_mass_transfer ] ) and ( [ eq : m1_dot_mass_trnasfer ] ) is obtained from mass transfer from the tertiary companion , with the assumption that the mass accretion is higher into the more massive object in the inner binary ( following the results by@xcite ) .",
    "in sections [ sub : timescales ] and [ sub : secular - dynamics ] we presented the relevant timescales , and the parameter determining the importance of the octupole term in the secular dynamics equations of motion .",
    "these timescales are dependent on the masses and smas of the triple components . by varying the mass we change the relevant timescale and the dynamics , as well as the relative importance of the octupole term .",

    "longer timescale the modulation from the octupole perturbation regime can also be seen .",
    "gr effects become important when the timescales of @xmath175 and @xmath176 become comparable or smaller than the other dynamical timescales .",
    "this happens when the inner binary becomes highly eccentric and/or the inner binary sma , @xmath5 becomes small .",
    "once the timescale for @xmath175 becomes comparable to the @xmath177 , gr precession perturbs the coherent evolution of the kozai - lidov evolution and the amplitude of the oscillatory behavior of the kozai mechanism@xcite is quenched . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mt_cb_gr ] we show the evolution of the same system , where we now include gr effects ; the quenching of the oscillatory behavior by the gr effects is clearly seen and can be well understood , since after the mass - transfer the 1pn timescale becomes smaller than the kozai period .",
    "indeed , the kozai period increases by more than an order of magnitude up to @xmath178 , and we find no variation of the orbital elements occurring on this ( or longer ) timescale ( not shown ) .",
    "realistic stellar systems undergo different evolutionary scenarios where secular mass loss and mass - transfer play an important role . these include winds from evolved stars , roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , wind rlof etc .",
    "incidents of mass - transfer or mass - loss may also be relevant to other systems , whether planets , moons or asteroidal systems ( e.g. through atmospheric evaporation ) .",
    "such processes have been studied extensively and their effects on binary systems have been explored .",
    "here we extended the study of these effects and model the effects of secular mass - loss / transfer on the long term dynamical behavior of _ triple _ systems ; the rich dynamics of triples becomes even more complex when coupled to such variation in the mass of the components .",
    "here we have shown for the first time that the dynamics of a triple hierarchical system including mass - loss and mass - transfer can be well modeled via double averaged hamiltonian expanded up to an octupole level @xcite . this hamiltonian presents several relevant timescales , which are significantly dependent on the mass and separation of the system components .",
    "mass - loss / mass - transfer therefore affect these relevant time - scales and can thereby transfer a triple system from one type of dynamical behavior regime to another , where the dynamics are dominated by a different type of perturbations / physical - processes .",
    "we used our model to study the evolution of various types of triple systems , and demonstrated several such evolutionary channels .",
    "these include the mass - loss induced eccentric kozai ( miek ) process ( also studied by @xcite using n - body integration ) and its reversed inverse - miek process , the secular evolution freeze - out ( sefo ) and mass transfer from a third companion to an inner binary ( see also related study by sph and n - body integration by @xcite ) .",
    "the miek process transfers a triple from the quadrupole ( stable oscillatory behavior ) to the octupole regime ( quasi - periodic and even chaotic behavior leading to extremely large changes in eccentricities and inclinations ) , where an inverse - miek , transferring a system from the octupole to the quadrupole regime , can also occur when mass is lost from the third outer companion .",
    "an additional similar process , sefo , can transfer a system from the quadrupole regimes to a state where secular evolution is either quenched or operates on excessively long time - scales .",
    "mass transfer from a third companion can both induce the formation of short - period binaries , as well as lead to quenched secular evolution , at the point where the systems becomes more susceptible to gr effects , which quench any further oscillatory behavior .",
    "finally , the model developed here shows excellent agreement with full n - body integration schemes , but has the important advantage of providing much faster ( orders of magnitude ) calculations .",
    "it provides a useful tool for the study of triple systems , and in particular for the exploration of a large phase space of initial conditions .",
    "it could therefore also be integrated into studies of larger - scale systems ( such as stellar clusters , where triples can play an important role ) and/or population synthesis studies where understanding the evolution of many triple systems becomes important ."
