    "large - scale radial velocity surveys for extra - solar planets require a great deal of planning , particularly in terms of instrument considerations and the selection of targets .",
    "the duration of the survey will affect the sensitivity of the survey to different regions of period space .",
    "additionally , the cadence of the observations affect the detection of short and long period planets and the overall planet yield .",
    "we present simulations of different observing strategies and demonstrate the change in sensitivity to a planetary period , mass , and eccentricity .",
    "these results are used to calculate the relative frequency of planet detections for various ranges of orbital parameters . by simulating a selection of cadence configurations ,",
    "the optimal cadence for a given survey duration and observing constraints is estimated .",
    "the techniques presented here may be applied to a wide range of planet surveys with limited resources in order to maximise planet yield .",
    "to investigate the detection efficiency properties of various radial velocity observing programs , we constructed a suite of simulated datasets using a fortran code which also performs the analysis , as described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kane , schneider , & ge ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "the parameters of the initial simulation are based upon those of the multi - object apo radial - velocity exoplanet large - area survey ( marvels ) ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ge et al .",
    "the stellar properties were estimated from tycho-2 stars selected for observation by marvels for 60 separate fields .",
    "the noise model for the simulation was produced from the current and planned performance of the instrument and used to generate the radial velocity data .",
    "the cadences were defined by the number of observations per month during bright time .",
    "an example cadence can be conveniently expressed as 888 , meaning 8 observations per month for 3 consecutive months .",
    "since we are concerned with exoplanet parameter sensitivity , each dataset was injected with a planetary signature , the parameters of which were randomly chosen from a uniform distribution including mass , period , and eccentricity . in this way , @xmath0  4 million datasets were produced for each cadence simulation .",
    "figure 1 represents an example simulated dataset , showing the radial velocity amplitudes and noise model .",
    "the code written for the task of sifting planet candidates from the data uses a weighted lomb - scargle ( l - s ) periodogram to detect a periodic signal .",
    "the number of false detections resulting from this technique depends upon the periodic false - alarm probability threshold one adopts as the detection criteria .",
    "we selected this threshold for each cadence by producing a large number of datasets with no planets injected , then executing a monte - carlo simulation to determine that threshold which yields the required maximum number of false detections .",
    "in addition , we distinguish between those detections with unique and ambiguous periods based on the number of significant peaks in the periodogram .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     there is a clear trade - off between the number of measurements and the number of unique detections .",
    "the choice of cadence therefore largely depends upon the amount of follow - up resources available .",
    "figure 5 is a cumulative histogram of the number of unique detections for a given cadence . beyond 3035 data points ,",
    "the fractional increase in unique detections becomes negligible , therefore suggesting that it would be most useful for increasing planet yield to change targets beyond this point .",
    "these simulations show that the choice of observing cadence can have a major impact on the exoplanetary parameter sensitivity . for example , reducing the number of measurements from 33 to 15 has a devastating impact on the planet yield .",
    "furthermore , restricting the 33 measurements to 18 months rather than 36 months increases the sensitivity to short - period planets .",
    "the detection of mid - high eccentricity planets are biased against by the current algorithm , but this is being addressed by investigating the inclusion of higher order fourier terms . since there is a continuum of possible cadence configurations , techniques to perform a more systematic search of cadence `` parameter space '' are being developed to determine optimal cadence solutions ."
