    "several properties which are related to the electronic density of states ( dos ) show simple , sometimes linear variation with tl content @xcite .",
    "these simple variations of the properties correlate with ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups ) results for the same alloy systems @xcite , which showed that dos at the fermi level ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 , is dominated by te d  states .",
    "accordingly , in amorphous te  tl alloys , the effect of alloying with tl can be approximated with the dilution of amorphous te @xcite .",
    "so far , a majority of results on te  tl alloys has been obtained for zr  tl metallic glasses , rendering a comparison between alloy systems based on different te ( eg .",
    "ti , zr , hf ) rarely possible @xcite .",
