    "the last 1020 years has seen rapid advances in theoretical understanding of planetary formation , the development of a variety of conceptual methods for extra - solar planet detection , the implementation of observational programmes to carry out targeted searches and , within the last five years , the detection of a number of planets beyond our own solar system .    shining only by reflected starlight",
    ", extra - solar planets comparable to bodies in our own solar system should be typically billions of times fainter than their host stars and , depending on their distances from us , at angular separations from their accompanying star of , at most , a few seconds of arc .",
    "this combination makes direct detection extraordinarily demanding , particularly at optical wavelengths where the star / planet intensity ratio is large , and especially from the ground given the perturbing effect of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "alternative detection methods , based on the dynamical perturbation of the star by the orbiting planet , on planetary transits , and on gravitational lensing , have therefore been developed , although these effects are also extremely subtle .",
    "radio pulsar timing achieved the first detection of planetary mass bodies beyond our solar system in 1992 .",
    "high - precision radial velocity ( doppler ) measurements resulted in the detection of the first extra - solar planetary systems surrounding main - sequence stars similar to our own in 1995 , and in 1999 gravitational microlensing provided ( contested ) evidence for a planet near the centre of our galaxy nearly 30000 light - years away .",
    "observational progress in extra - solar planet detection and characterization is now moving rapidly on a number of fronts .",

    "section  [ sec : life ] touches upon some of the issues relevant for the development of the field from planet discovery to the detection of life .",
    "the existence and formation of planets should first be placed in a broader astronomical context . over the last two decades a standard paradigm has emerged for the origin and evolution of structure in the universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this picture , the universe expanded from a hot , dense and smooth state , the hot big bang ( the planck form of the cosmic microwave background provides evidence for this back to a universe age of a few months , while the light element abundances extend this to an age of a few minutes ) .",
    "the observed near - homogeneity and isotropy were produced by an early phase of inflationary expansion , with all observed structure originating from quantum zero - point fluctuations during the inflationary period , and growing by gravitational amplification .",
    "galaxies were formed by cooling and condensation of gas in the cores of heavy halos produced by non - linear hierarchical clustering of dark matter  the unseen and unknown form of non - baryonic , weakly interacting matter considered to dominate gravitating mass at the present time .    in the standard model of star formation",
    ", stars form from gravitational instabilities in interstellar clouds of gas and ` dust ' grains , leading to collapse and fragmentation ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a density perturbation ( e.g.  due to a shock wave ) may cause the gravitational binding energy of a certain region of a cloud to exceed its thermal energy , in which case the region begins to contract ( the jeans instability criterion ) . the details , including effects such as stellar rotation and magnetic fields , are complex and incompletely known , and the early phases are considered particularly uncertain ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most massive stars evolved rapidly , creating new elements by nucleosynthesis , and dispersing them through gaseous outflows or supernova explosions .",
    "part of the chemically enriched material remained in the gas phase , while part condensed into solid dust grains ( e.g.  silicates ) , together providing material for subsequent generations of star formation .",
    "for a cloud with some initial rotation gravitational collapse will lead , from conservation of angular momentum , to a flattened system , with a high proportion of double and multiple stars arising from the fragmentation process ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "single star formation then involves three fairly distinct stages , within which flattened disks appear to be a natural by - product : ( i ) collapse , under self - gravity , of an extended cloud of gas and dust grains assembled from the debris of processed stars and remnants of the early universe ( the gas consists primarily of h@xmath16 molecules along with h and he atoms and simple molecules such as co , co@xmath16 ,",
    "n@xmath16 , ch@xmath17 and h@xmath16o , while the dust grains , of order 10  @xmath18 m in size , each contain typically @xmath19 atoms of c , si , o etc .  with outer coatings of h@xmath16o or co@xmath16 ) .",
    "the material accumulates quickly towards the central proto - star , but with enough residual angular momentum to prevent total collapse onto the central object .",
    "the average angular momentum of the collapsing region defines the rotation axis of the resulting disk , whose thickness is much smaller than its radius , and which therefore forms a thin plane or circumstellar disk extending out to about 100  au ( in the case of our solar system , well beyond the orbit of pluto ) .",
    "the formation of the relatively stable disk probably occurs over about @xmath20  years after the onset of free - fall collapse ; ( ii ) inflow of gas and dust from the disk onto the central object by self - gravitation , heating the centrally condensed gas by compression until nuclear fusion occurs in the central parts and the star is formed on time scales of @xmath21  years .",
    "material in the disk is replenished by infall from the surrounding molecular cloud ; ( iii ) through redistribution of mass and angular momentum in the disk , a centrifugally - supported residual ` solar nebula ' is formed containing the material that accumulates to form planets ( section  [ sec : planet - formation ] ) .",
    "the process ends when all the residual nebula gas has been lost , either by escape to interstellar space , or to the central star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting stars shine by thermonuclear fusion , with stable hydrogen burning occurring for masses above about @xmath22 ( about @xmath23 ) , when the central temperature triggers nucleosynthesis , this mass limit being slightly sensitive to initial chemical composition .",
    "objects having marginally smaller masses ( 0.0750.070@xmath24 ) are not stars , in the sense that they are never fully supported by nuclear energy generation , but their thermal energy output means that they nevertheless spend about @xmath25  years ( roughly the present age of the universe ) at luminosities @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "brown dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are objects which occupy the mass range of about 1280@xmath1 ( @xmath27 ) , and are also considered to have formed by gravitational instability in a gas .",
    "these objects are not massive enough to ignite stable hydrogen burning although deuterium fusion in their cores , contributing to their luminosity , is possible down to masses of about @xmath28 . below this limit , which is again sensitive to chemical composition , and which also depends on structural uniformity , nuclear processes , and the role of dust ( @xcite ) , objects should retain essentially their entire deuterium complement of around the protosolar value , d / h  @xmath29 , and derive no luminosity from thermonuclear fusion at any stage in their evolutionary lifetime ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum mass for star formation via fragmentation is determined by the minimum jeans mass along the track of a collapsing cloud in the ( @xmath30 ) plane , which occurs when the cloud or fragment first becomes optically thick .",
    "the minimum mass that can be obtained in this way appears to be around 720@xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , a mass limit of @xmath31 represents a useful boundary , from both formation and nuclear reaction perspectives , to provisionally distinguish ( giant ) planets from the more massive brown dwarfs .",
    "the extent to which this distinction is confirmed by the recent discoveries will be considered in section  [ sec : properties ] .",
    "the recent detection of ` free - floating ' objects of brown dwarf and planetary mass , which appear to have formed by this fragmentation process in young clusters and star - forming regions ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) is not considered here in further detail .",
    "a number of theories of the origin of our solar system have been advanced , starting with the scientific theory of @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the most",
    "widely considered ` solar nebula theory ' planet formation in our solar system ( and , by inference , planetary formation in general ) follows on from the process of star formation described previously , through the agglomeration of residual protoplanetary disk material .    in this paradigm ,",
    "planet formation proceeds through several sub - stages characterised by differences in the respective particle interactions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "first , the dust grains settle into a dense layer in the mid - plane of the disk , and begin to stick together as they collide , forming macroscopic objects with sizes of order 0.0110 m , all orbiting the protostar in the same direction and in the same plane , analogous to the few hundred metre thick rings around saturn . in a second stage , over the next @xmath32  years ,",
    "further collisions lead to the formation of ` planetesimals ' , objects up to a km or so in size , driven by gravitational interactions , and leading to the concentration of objects into particular orbits , with nearly empty gaps between them . in the third phase",
    ", the mutual gravitational interaction between planetesimals leads to small changes in their keplerian orbits , resulting in subsequent collisions , some of which would shatter the planetesimals , but most of which occur at velocities producing a single larger object , or embryo .",
    "these are of mass @xmath33  kg in the terrestrial planet region , and of larger but uncertain mass in the outer solar system .    in the presence of an adequate mass of planetesimals , runaway growth of embryos",
    "occurs as a result of dynamical friction , three - body effects , and fragmentation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "runaway growth of these lunar- to mercury - sized bodies requires as little as @xmath34  years at 1  au , but of the order of a few million years in the outer part of the asteroid belt . when the gravitational pull of the largest planetesimals is sufficient , they grow rapidly to the size of small planets by mutual collisions and mergers , with the terrestrial planets growing over time scales of between @xmath35 to a few times @xmath36  years ( @xcite ) , primarily limited by the time required to sweep up bodies accelerated to high velocities by close encounters and outer planet resonances .",
    "mergers proceed by pairwise accretion until the spacing of planetary orbits becomes large enough that the configuration is stable for the lifetime of the system ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the case of our solar system , a few solid cores in the outer parts of the proto - solar disk became large enough ( @xmath37 ) to accrete residual gas ( h and he ) slowly , giving rise to the giant planets  jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in the generalised picture of gas giant formation by core accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) these objects formed far out from the central proto - star  closer in , temperatures were too high to allow ice formation and gas accretion ( ` ice ' generally refers to a combination of volatiles , such as water , methane , and ammonia , in either a solid or liquid phase ) , and the total mass of disk material close in was anyhow smaller ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternative theories of giant planet formation through gravitational instability of a massive cool solar nebula , leading to fragmentation on a dynamical time scale ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) and thus circumventing the lengthier formation time scale demanded by core accretion , is discussed by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "termination of the planet s accretion process , by clearing a gap around its orbit , depends on the ( unknown ) viscosity of the protoplanetary disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "factors determining the ultimate size and spacing of gas giant planets are complex and poorly understood .",
    "modern theories of planetary growth do not yield deterministic ` bode s law ' formulae for planetary orbits ( @xcite ) , but characteristic orbital spacings do exist , suggesting that gaps develop roughly in proportion to the distance from the central star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "long - term ( hill ) stability of the resulting orbits depends on the separation of the semi - major axes ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "orbital resonances can either increase orbital stability ( e.g.  in the case of neptune  pluto ) or lead to instabilities .",
    "larger eccentricities tend to destabilise systems because bodies can approach each other more closely , while large inclinations usually increase stability since the bodies remain farther apart .",
    "modelling of the solar system stability shows that mercury , for example , could be chaotically ejected following close encounters with venus within 3.5  gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "planetesimal formation in binary systems has been considered by various authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the solar system ,",
    "planetesimals which grew to modest size without joining larger objects , as well as collisional debris , are represented by meteoroids and comets .",
    "the former comprise objects made of ` rock ' ( a combination of iron- and magnesium - bearing silicates and metallic iron ) with random orbits and ranging up to a few hundred metres in size , while the latter comprise ` dirty snowballs ' of frozen h@xmath16o , co@xmath16 , and dust grains up to a few km in size ( @xcite ) .",
    "comets comprise two families : the edgeworth - kuiper belt , extending from 50  au ( beyond pluto ) to hundreds or a few thousand  au , forming a vast system possibly identified with the remnant of the sun s protoplanetary disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the oort cloud consists of some @xmath38 comets of all orbital orientations , extending out to tens of thousands of  au , but with a total mass of only a few @xmath39 .",
    "it originated from the gravitational scattering of planetesimals early in the history of the solar system by uranus and neptune , objects sent outwards at close to the solar system escape velocity , and perturbed into long - lived orbits by nearby stars or the galactic tidal field .",
    "bodies scattered from jupiter and saturn , deeper within the sun s gravitational potential well , would have been lost from the solar system .",
    "the smallest objects in the solar system , swarms of sand to small meteoroids , are presumably debris left over from the earliest phase .",
    "the final formation stage would be accompanied by the impact of the last fragments of matter , evidence of which is seen in the impact craters of the moon ( whose origin now tends to be attributed to a giant impact event with the earth during the later stages of planetary formation , rather than to capture , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "even today at intervals of several tens of millions of years , a small planetesimal or comet in an earth - crossing orbit strikes our planet , these impacts being considered responsible for mass extinctions such as at the cretaceous / tertiary boundary some 65  million years ago ( e.g.@xcite ) .    in the case of our solar system formation theories",
    "can be confronted with a wealth of diverse observational constraints : orbital motions , stability , and spacings of the nine planets ; planetary masses , rotations , and the existence of planetary satellites and rings ; angular momentum distribution ; bulk and isotopic composition ; radio - isotope ages ; cratering records ; and the occurrence of comets , asteroids and meteorites including the presence of the oort cloud and the edgeworth - kuiper belt ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    while the present paradigm of planet formation offers many attractive features , various problems",
    "remain : for example , the details of the redistribution of angular momentum , the requirements for and dominant source of turbulence during the early nebular phase , the size and ` stickiness ' of the dust grains required for the first phase of large particle formation from micron - sized dust to km - sized planetesimals ( @xcite ) , the formation time scale of the giant planets and , in the case of our solar system , issues including the @xmath40 tilt of the solar spin axis with respect to the mean orbital plane , the detailed distribution of the planetary satellites , the isotopic anomalies in meteorites , and the formation of chondrites ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "alternative theories exist , most notably developments of the ` capture theory ' ( @xcite ) which built upon early ideas by @xcite , and which involves the tidal interaction between the sun and a lower - mass , diffuse cool protostar .",
    "the subsequent developments of this model , and its merits , are reviewed by @xcite .",
    "this review concentrates on the detection and characterisation of discrete extra - solar planetary mass bodies , although observational evidence for disks is also summarised . in considering detection methods ,",
    "the order followed in this section progresses roughly from the most to the least intuitive , although this is somewhat uncorrelated with technical feasibility and progress to date .",
    "although almost all systems currently known ( loosely classified as giant planets with masses of order @xmath41 ) have been detected by high - precision radial velocity measurements , the prospects for the detection of planets with masses significantly below that of jupiter appear somewhat limited by this method .",
    "the development of other methods will be required to lower planetary mass detection limits towards the ` habitable zone ' ( section  [ sec : life ] ) , to enlarge the sample sizes to provide better constraints on formation theories , and to enhance the knowledge of the physical properties of the detected systems .",
    "parameters used are mass @xmath42 , radius @xmath43 , and luminosity @xmath44 , with subscripts @xmath45 and @xmath46 referring to star and planet respectively .",
    "systems are characterised by their orbital period @xmath47 , semi - major axis @xmath48 , eccentricity @xmath49 , orbital inclination with respect to the plane of the sky @xmath50 ( @xmath51 face - on , @xmath52 edge - on ) , and distance from the solar system @xmath53 . unless explicitly noted , it is assumed that a single dominant planet is in orbit around the star , a simplification in the case of our own solar system , and perhaps the majority of others , but one which appears to be an acceptable starting point for describing the systems detected to date .",
    "figure  [ fig : methods ] summarises the detection possibilities referred to in this section .",
    "imaging of an extra - solar planet generally refers to the detection of a point source image of the object seen in the reflected light from the parent star .",
    "this is to be distinguished from resolution of the planet surface , prospects for which are discussed briefly at the end of this section .",
    "the ratio of the planet to stellar brightness depends on the planet s size and proximity to the star , and on the scattering properties of the planet s atmosphere . for reflected light of wavelength @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a phase - dependent function , including the effects of orbital inclination , depending on the amplitude and angular dependence of the various sources of scattering in the planetary atmosphere , integrated over the surface of the sphere .",
    "@xmath57 is the angle between the star and observer as seen from the planet .",
    "the scattering properties are characterised by the geometric albedo , @xmath46 , being the flux from the planet at @xmath58 compared to the equivalent flux from a lambert law ( perfectly diffusing ) disk of the same diameter ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the formula , including the phase dependence , is modified if thermal emission from the planet is significant .",
    "@xmath59 is very small , of order @xmath60 for a jupiter - type object at maximum elongation .",
    "viewed from a ground - based telescope , with a star - planet separation of 1  arcsec ( jupiter viewed from 5  pc ) the planet signal is immersed in the photon noise of the telescope s diffraction profile ( @xmath61  arcsec at 500  nm for a 5-m telescope ) and more problematically within the ` seeing ' profile ( of order 1  arcsec ) arising from turbulent atmospheric refraction . under these conditions",
    "elementary signal - to - noise calculations imply that obtaining a direct image of the planet is not feasible .",
    "imaging efforts are directed at ways of reducing the angular size of the stellar image , suppressing scattered light ( including use of coronographic masks ) , minimising the effects of atmospheric turbulence ( including eliminating them altogether using space observations ) , and enhancing the contrast between the planet and the star by observing at longer wavelengths ( favourable for detection of thermal emission ) .",
    "none of these imaging techniques has been successfully applied to extra - solar planetary detection so far .",
    "but they represent important long - term efforts since they provide the basis for attempts to measure the spectral features of planets , and therefore the possibility of detecting signatures of life in their atmospheres .",
    "specifically , direct imaging will in future be capable of providing broad - band colours and eventually spectral energy distributions , giving constraints on temperature and chemical composition , and ultimately insights into the planet s chemical and biological processes .",
    "a promising route to the detection and characterisation of extra - solar terrestrial planets , and especially for detecting signatures of life , would be an infrared space interferometer , with baselines of order 50  m. before detailing these ideas , ground - based efforts will be described , since a necessary prerequisite for space experiments will be the building and testing of ground - based optical interferometers , a task complicated considerably by atmospheric turbulence .",
    "prospects for ground - based planetary imaging have concentrated on the use of adaptive optics ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; cf .",
    "the related but simpler use of active optics which compensates for , e.g. , gravitational flexure at much lower temporal and spatial frequencies ) .",
    "adaptive optics is under intensive development for the latest generation of large ( 810  m class ) astronomical telescopes , aiming to compensate for atmospheric phase fluctuations across the telescope pupil in order to achieve diffraction - limited resolution .",
    "the method relies on continuous measurement of the wavefront from a reference star , then applying an equal but opposite correction using a deformable mirror containing actuators distributed across its surface , at frequencies of order 1  khz .",
    "adaptive systems typically rely on a nearby bright reference star to measure these phase fluctuations .",
    "measurements must be made within a narrow coherent region , the isoplanatic patch , and over pupil sub - apertures of size @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the atmospheric coherence length ( 0.150.2  m at a good site at visible wavelengths , increasing to @xmath641  m at 2  @xmath18 m ) .",
    "the use of artificial laser guide stars from resonant scattering in the mesospheric sodium layer at 95  km is expected to extend the applicability of the technique to arbitrary locations on the sky ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if the position of the planet is known , adjustments can be made so that the stellar light from the different parts of the mirror arrives destructively at the planet location . in",
    "the ` dark speckle ' technique ( @xcite ) , rapid random changes in optical path length due to the atmospheric turbulence are exploited , with the goal of detecting the planet in very short exposures ( @xmath65  ms ) when , by chance , the star light interferes destructively at the planet location .",
    "the challenges posed by such measurements are made clearer by reference to figure  [ fig : gliese229b ] , which shows the brown dwarf gliese 229  b imaged from the ground ( with adaptive optics ) and from space .",
    "adaptive optics programmes underway at the world s largest ground - based telescopes being developed for interferometry ( the european southern observatory s very large telescope , the eso vlt at cerro paranal , chile ; and the us keck telescopes , hawaii ) may ultimately have the sensitivity to detect giant planets around several nearby bright stars , taking into account the effects of photon noise and speckle noise ( caused by residual wavefront errors ) , diffraction and scattering from the telescope mirrors , the ` dark speckle ' technique , and eventual interferometric combination of the beams from the individual telescopes .",
    "the keck  ii telescope has a 349-actuator system ( @xcite ) , the main effect of which will be to achieve a concentration in light from the planet and hence improve the planet / star intensity ratio by @xmath66 .",
    "the reduction of scattered light is not greatly affected beyond field angles @xmath67 where @xmath53 is the actuator spacing , corresponding to 0.5  arcsec at 1.25  @xmath18 m for a 0.56-m actuator spacing .",
    "higher - order systems , e.g.  the @xmath68 actuator system proposed by @xcite , would bring into reach the detection of giant planets around some 100 stars .",
    "massive optical apertures such as the 100-m owl telescope ( @xcite ) are under consideration , and with a planet detection sensitivity @xmath69 , such a telescope equipped with @xmath19 actuators might lead to the detection of earth - like planets around 100 stars .",
    "the most promising imaging opportunities , however , exist from space . @xcite",
    "considered lyot filtering to decrease the brightness of the airy rings , while @xcite suggested an analogue of phase - contrast microscopy to attenuate scattered light arising from the imperfect figure of a 2-m space telescope .",
    "@xcite proposed a space telescope in an orbit yielding a stationary lunar occultation of any star lasting two hours , using the black limb of the moon as an occulting edge to reduce the background light from the planet s star , a concept which has been extended recently to the idea of a large occulting satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted that with sun / jupiter temperatures of 6000k and 128k , detection of thermal emission in the rayleigh - jeans regime longward of @xmath70 m ( where the thermal infrared from the planet is strongest ) would result in a factor of @xmath34 improvement in the intensity contrast .",
    "they also introduced the principle of nulling interferometry to enhance the planet / star signal . in this technique , light from two or more small apertures , typically 2050  m apart , are combined out of phase , the baseline being adjusted such that the stellar light interferes destructively over a broad wavelength range , while the planet signal interferes constructively ( the baseline can be adjusted such that the radius of constructive interference corresponds to the ` habitable zone ' ) . rotating the interferometer about an axis through the star would allow detecting the faint planet from the signal modulated at harmonics of the spin frequency .",
    "ideas for improved space missions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or balloon experiments above altitudes of 30  km ( @xcite ) have subsequently been developed , with similar principles being tested on the ground ( @xcite ) .",

    "reviews of the progress of these radial velocity searches have been given by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "@xcite first reported a low - mass companion to a star , hd  114762 , inferring a mass of about 10@xmath1 , which was further constrained by observations by @xcite , and is consistent with a massive planet or low - mass brown dwarf .",
    "however , by 1995 , none of the ongoing programmes had measured any systems with smaller masses expected to be representative of a postulated planetary mass population , and there seemed to be a deficiency of sub - solar mass stars which could represent the tail of the stellar mass function .",
    "the first report of a planetary candidate of significantly lower mass , surrounding the star 51  peg , was announced by @xcite .",
    "this discovery was rapidly confirmed by the lick observatory group , who were also quickly able to report two new planets that they had been monitoring : 70  vir ( @xcite ) and 47  uma ( @xcite ) .    with @xmath95  days and @xmath96  au ,",
    "51  peg provoked early controversy , partly in view of its unexpectedly short orbital period and hence close proximity to the parent star ) , but also since an alternative explanation  that the radial velocity shifts arose from non - radial oscillations  was put forward to explain possible distortions in the absorption line profile bisector ( the locus of midpoints from the core up to the continuum ) .",
    "studies that followed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) finally resulted in a consensus that the planet hypothesis was the most reasonable possibility .",
    "other planets have typically not proven to be controversial , and work since the discovery papers is devoted to studies of their properties or those of their parent star .",
    "additional detections by a number of different groups have followed rapidly .",
    "the present list of stars with inferred planetary mass companions numbers 34 ( see table  [ tab : known - planets ] ) , with further detections expected to follow steadily as new surveys , more objects , higher measurement accuracies , and longer temporal baselines ( permitting the discovery of longer period systems ) take effect .",
    "the observed and derived properties of these systems are proving fertile ground for theories of planetary formation ( section  [ sec : properties ] ) .",
    "the dearth of brown dwarf candidates has continued , with the precision doppler surveys , along with lower precision surveys of several thousand stars , having revealed only 11 orbiting brown dwarf candidates in the mass range @xmath97 , despite the fact that there is no bias against brown dwarf companions , and the fact that they are much easier to detect than companions of jupiter mass .",
    "most of these objects in fact appear to be hydrogen - burning stars with low orbital inclination ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; this paucity of brown dwarf companions presently renders the planets distinguishable by their high occurrence at low masses .      the path of a star orbiting the star - planet barycentre appears projected on the plane of the sky as an ellipse with angular semi - major axis @xmath57 given by : @xmath98 where @xmath57 is in arcsec when @xmath48 is in  au and @xmath53 is in  pc ( and @xmath90 and @xmath79 are in common units ) .",
    "this ` astrometric signature ' is therefore proportional to both the planet mass and the orbital radius , and inversely proportional to the distance to the star .",
    "astrometric techniques aim to measure this transverse component of the photocentric displacement .",
    "jupiter orbiting the sun viewed from a distance of 10  pc would result in an astrometric amplitude of 500  microarcsec ( @xmath18as ) , while the effect of the earth at 10  pc is a one - year period with 0.3  @xmath18as amplitude ( the motion of the sun over , say 50  years , is complex due to the combined gravitational effect of all the planets ) .",
    "the astrometric accuracy required to detect planets through this reflex motion is therefore typically in the sub - milliarcsec range , although it would reach a few milliarcsec for @xmath99 for very nearby solar - mass stars .",
    "the astrometric technique is particularly sensitive to relatively long orbital periods ( @xmath100  yr ) , and hence complements radial velocity measurements .",
    "the method is also applicable to hot or rapidly rotating stars for which radial velocity techniques are limited .",
    "one important feature is that if @xmath48 is known from spectroscopic measurements , @xmath53 from the star s parallax motion , and if @xmath79 can be estimated from its spectral type or from evolutionary models , then the astrometric displacement yields @xmath90 directly rather than @xmath80 given by radial velocity measurements ; a single measurement of the angular separation at one epoch from ground - based interferometric astrometry would also provide orbital constraints on @xmath87 ( @xcite ) . for multi - planet systems astrometric measurements can determine their relative orbital inclinations ( i.e. , whether the planets are co - planar ) , an important ingredient for formation theories and dynamical stability analyses .",
    "possible mimicking of astrometric planetary perturbations by a nearby binary star has been considered by @xcite .",
    "astrometric detection demands very accurate positional measurements within a well - defined reference system at a number of epochs , and is very challenging for optical measurements from the ground , again because of the atmospheric phase fluctuations . across the electromagnetic spectrum accessible to astronomical observations , milliarcsec positional measurements or better",
    "are presently only achieved at radio and optical wavelengths , and these are considered in turn .    in the radio",
    ", milliarcsec positional accuracy is now reached through high - precision very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) , using baselines of order 3000  km , with phase referencing techniques providing sufficient sensitivity to detect a number of nearby radio emitting stars .",
    "the highest accuracies have been reported for the close binary system @xmath101  crb ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in these systems , named after their prototype rs  cvn , quiescent and flaring gyro - synchrotron radio emission is generated from mev electrons in magnetic structures related to the intra - stellar region and stellar photosphere respectively .",
    "observations of @xmath101  crb since 1987 yielded post - fit rms residuals of 0.20  milliarcsec ( @xcite ) which would correspond , at a distance @xmath102pc , to the displacement which would be expected for a jupiter - like planet around the binary system .",
    "only about five nearby radio stars are suitable for monitoring as part of a planetary search programme : jupiter mass companions would produce perturbations above 1  milliarcsec , while an earth - like planet around the nearest radio - emitting star uv  ceti would result in a displacement of about 8  microarcsec .",
    "no candidate planets have so far been reported using this technique .",
    "discussions of ground - based optical observations related to planet detection are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unconfirmed reports of small , long - period astrometric displacements consistent with planetary bodies have been made for barnard s star , based on observations over many years , yielding two proposed planetary mass bodies ( 0.7 and 0.5  @xmath1 ) with periods of 12 and 20 years respectively ( @xcite ) , and for lalande 21185 with a mass of 0.9  @xmath1 and @xmath103  years ( @xcite ) .",
    "measurement of sub - milliarcsec displacements has been impossible to date because of atmospheric effects .",
    "accuracies for narrow - angle ground - based measurements are improving rapidly , with prospects for measurements at the tens of microarcsec or better , building on the success of the mk  iii optical interferometer ( @xcite ) , e.g.from the palomar testbed interferometer ( @xcite ) , from the keck interferometer ( @xcite ) , and from eso s vlti ( @xcite ) .",
    "these instruments should ultimately provide very high relative astrometric accuracy over small fields ( for example , on bright double or multiple systems ) at the 10  microarcsec level ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . within eso s vlti programme ,",
    "prima ( phase - referenced imaging and microarcsecond astrometry ) aims to use the four 8.2-m telescopes to achieve 1050  microarcsec astrometry for various narrow - field applications .",
    "astrometric measurements can be made more accurately from above the earth s atmosphere .",
    "only a single astrometric space mission has been carried out to date , hipparcos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which provided @xmath65  milliarcsec accuracy for about 120000 stars .",
    "specific methods have been applied to the individual hipparcos measurements for the detection of brown dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for known planetary systems ,",
    "the hipparcos data have provided some constraints on planetary masses : @xcite derived weak upper limits on @xmath90 in a few cases ; @xcite derived a mass for the outer companion of @xmath104  and of @xmath105 , compared with @xmath106 ; and @xcite have concluded that the companion of hd  10697 is probably a brown dwarf .",
    "although some inferences about the properties of systems discovered by radial velocity measurements have been possible from the hipparcos results , it is evident from equation  [ equ : astrom ] ( and figure  [ fig : astrom ] ) that milliarcsec astrometry can contribute only marginally to extra - solar planet detection .",
    "in contrast , large - scale acquisition of microarcsec astrometric measurements in the future promises at least three important developments .",
    "first , measurements significantly below 0.1  milliarcsec offer planet detection possibilities well below the jupiter mass limit , out to 50200  pc .",
    "second , in combination with spectroscopic measurements they provide direct determination of the planet mass ( in terms of the star mass ) , independent of the orbital inclination .",
    "third , the relative orbital inclination of multi - planet systems can be determined .",
    "future space astrometry experiments include those targeting measurements accuracies of below a milli - arcsecond , specifically diva , a german national project at the proposal stage ( @xcite ) and fame , an approved nasa project ( @xcite ) . at even higher",
    "accuracies are the microarcsec - class sim mission , a nasa approved project ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and gaia , an esa project at the proposal stage ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "sim is a pointed mission which will be especially powerful for detailed orbit determinations for planetary systems detected from ground - based experiments .",
    "gaia will survey approximately a billion stars to @xmath107  mag as part of a census of the galactic stellar population . on the assumption that 45  per cent of solar - type stars have jupiter - mass companions ( @xcite ) it will detect ( and provide orbital parameters in many cases ) for upwards of 10000 planetary systems of mass @xmath108 and periods around 110  years ( @xcite ) , for stars as faint as about 15  mag . with proposed launch dates between 2004 ( fame ) to 2009 ( gaia ) astrometric space missions",
    "will contribute to the detection and orbital determination of large numbers of planetary systems , providing target lists for further observations by other techniques ( figure  [ fig : astrom ] ) .    while sub - microarcsec astrometry may be feasible in the more distant future , the ultimate limit to the astrometric detection of earth - like planets from space",
    "may be the non - uniformity of illumination over the disk of a star .",
    "the earth causes the sun s centre of mass to move with a semi - amplitude of about 500  km ( 0.03  per cent of the stellar diameter ) , while sunspots with up to 1  per cent of the sun s area will cause the apparent centre of light of the sun to move by up to 0.5  per cent ( @xcite ) .",
    "although all orbital systems are affected by changes in light travel time across the orbit , in general there is no timing reference on which to base such measurements .",
    "a notable exception are radio pulsars , rapidly spinning highly - magnetised neutron stars , formed during the core collapse of massive stars ( 820@xmath24 ) in a supernova explosion .",
    "pulsars emit narrow beams of radio emission parallel to their magnetic dipole axis , seen as intense pulses at the object s spin frequency due to a misalignment of the magnetic and spin axes .",
    "there are two broad classes : ` normal ' pulsars , with spin periods around 1  s , and of which several hundred are known ; and the millisecond pulsars , ` recycled ' old ( @xmath109  yr ) neutron stars that have been spun - up to very short spin periods during mass and angular momentum transfer from a binary companion , with most of the 30  known objects still having ( non - accreting ) binary companions , either white dwarfs or neutron stars .",
    "the latter are extremely accurate frequency standards , with periods changing only through a tiny spin - down at a rate @xmath110ss@xmath86 presumed due to their low magnetic field strength ( @xcite ) .    for a circular ,",
    "edge - on orbit , and a canonical pulsar mass of @xmath111 , the amplitude of timing residuals due to planetary motion is ( @xcite ) : @xmath112 the extremely high accuracy of pulsar timing allows the detection of lower mass bodies orbiting the pulsar to be inferred from changes in pulse arrival times due to orbital motion . jovian or terrestrial planets are expected to be detectable around ` normal ' slow pulsars , while substantially lower masses , down to that of our moon and largest asteroids , could be recognised in millisec pulsar timing residuals .",
    "the first planetary system discovered around an object other than our sun was found around the 6.2-ms pulsar psr  1257 + 12 ( @xmath113  pc ) , with at least two plausible terrestrial - mass companions ( @xcite ) having masses of 2.8 and @xmath114 , and almost circular orbits with @xmath115 and 0.36  au , and @xmath116 and 66.54  days respectively , close to a 3:2 orbital resonance . although a number of alternative ways of producing the observed timing residuals were examined ( @xcite ) , the planet hypothesis was rigorously verifiable : the semi - major axes of the orbits are sufficiently similar that the two planets would perturb one another significantly during individual close encounters , with resulting three - body effects leading to departures from a simple non - interacting keplerian model growing rapidly with time ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ".    continued monitoring of psr  1257 + 12 provided evidence for a third companion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) with @xmath117  days , and possibly a fourth , with @xmath118  yr ( @xcite ) , as well as confirmation of the predicted mutual gravitational perturbations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the third planet may be an artifact of temporal changes of heliospheric electron density at the solar rotation rate at the relevant heliospheric latitude ( @xcite ) , although this unconfirmed explanation would not invalidate the existence of the other two planets ; further observations will establish if the 25.3  day periodicity is frequency independent , and thus unrelated to solar interference .",
    "dynamical simulations indicate that the system would be stable over some hundreds of thousands of years ( @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for a long - period planet around the slow pulsar psr  b0329 + 54 ( spin period 0.71  s ) was reported by @xcite , based on large second time derivatives of the spin frequency . although alternative explanations were also given , the planetary interpretation was supported by @xcite , who gave @xmath119  yr , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122  au .",
    "both groups reported an additional 3  yr periodicity in pulse arrival times .",
    "the planetary hypothesis has recently been questioned by @xcite based on further observations , with variations in the timing residuals for this relatively young neutron star attributed to spin irregularities or precession of the pulsar spin axis .",
    "@xcite used similar timing techniques to detect a 1030@xmath1 object orbiting the binary pulsar psr  b162026 in the globular cluster  m4 .",
    "the pulsar is tightly orbited by a white dwarf , and the third object is the lightest and most distant member of a hierarchical triple system , with @xmath123  3560au and @xmath124yr .",
    "a possible formation scenario for this triple system involves a dynamical exchange interaction between the binary pulsar and a primordial star - planet system , in which the planet was captured by the binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "whether the outer body is a planet or a brown dwarf remains to be established , but further examples and detailed evaluation of capture probabilities may indicate whether significant numbers of extra - solar planetary systems also exist in old star clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    unconfirmed evidence for a companion ( @xmath125  au and @xmath126 ) to the radio quiet pulsar geminga was reported from @xmath127  ray observations ( @xcite ) , although this may have been an artifact of the spin period .",
    "a possible companion to psr  182910 ( @xcite ) was subsequently retracted ( @xcite ) .",
    "no other planetary systems around millisec pulsars have been discovered , suggesting that planetary systems around old neutron stars are probably rare .",
    "whilst considered as somewhat distinct from the planetary systems surrounding main sequence stars , the pulsar planets provide constraints on plausable formation processes .",
    "models for planet production around pulsars divide into two broad classes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the first ,",
    "the planet formed around either a normal star ( possibly the pulsar progenitor , its continued existence implying that it had survived the supernova explosion ) , or around another star and was subsequently captured by the pulsar .",
    "alternatively , the planet formed after the neutron star was created , a process requiring the capture of material , perhaps from a pre - existing stellar companion , into an accretion disk around the pulsar . subsequent fragmentation into planets would then follow the more standard model of planet formation ( section  [ sec : planet - formation ] ) .",
    "difficulties in modeling multiple planets which survive the supernova explosion make the accretion disk model more favoured , especially for the psr  1257 + 12 system , with residual disk material governing the transport of angular momentum and possibly providing the means to circularise the orbits and bring them close to the observed 3:2 resonance ( @xcite ) .",
    "white dwarfs , the end point of stellar evolution for most stars , undergo a less violent birth than pulsars , and planets would likely be surviving members of original systems , more closely related to our own solar system , although they may also be created around white dwarfs as part of the pulsar formation process ( @xcite ) . timing detection methods similar to those used for radio pulsars",
    "can be applied but using a very different timing signature ( @xcite ) . as the white dwarf cools through certain temperature ranges c / o ( at @xmath34  k ) , he ( at @xmath128  k ) and h ( at @xmath68  k ) in its photosphere progressively become partially ionized , driving multi - periodic non - radial @xmath129-mode pulsations in the period range 1001000  s , with some objects amongst the most stable pulsators known ( @xcite ) .",
    "data going back 20  years , originally acquired to probe white dwarf interiors , have been used to place upper limits on planetary companion masses for two objects : g117b15a ( @xcite ) , where the rate of change of period for the 215  s pulsation is @xmath130  ss@xmath86 , and for g2938 ( @xcite ) , with present searches being sensitive to planetary companions down to 0.5@xmath1 if seen edge on , with @xmath131  yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "formation conditions and detection possibilities for surviving planets around stars in the planetary nebula phase have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : domains ] illustrates the parameter regions probed by radial velocity , astrometric , and transit measurements at current and projected accuracy levels .",
    "detection of extra - solar planets by measuring the photometric signature of the eclipse of the star by a planet was first considered by @xcite .",
    "the method is conceptually simple : given a suitable alignment geometry , star light is attenuated by the transit of the orbiting planet across its disk , with the effect repeating at the orbital period of the planet . for a sun / jupiter system at 10  pc ,",
    "the resulting luminosity change is of order 2% , or 0.02  mag . in the early 1970s",
    "this was considered as observationally more feasible than the prospects of detecting an astrometric shift of 0.0005  arcsec , or a radial velocity perturbation of around 10ms@xmath86 . however , the probability of observing an eclipse , seen from a random direction and at a random time , is extremely small .",
    "the idea was developed by @xcite , who proposed detecting the eclipse colour signature , which could be measured as a change in ratio due to limb darkening rather than in absolute intensity , and who considered in detail the effects of stellar noise sources ( intrinsic stellar variations , flares , coronal effects , sunspots , etc . ) and earth atmospheric effects ( air mass , absorption bands , seeing , and scintillation ) .",
    "the method is presently considered as one of the most promising means of detecting planets with masses significantly below that of jupiter , with the detection of earth - class ( and hence habitable ) planets within its capabilities .",
    "extrapolation of the method down to masses of planetary satellite may even be feasible .",
    "further refinements have therefore continued ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and recent reviews are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "detection probabilities depend on the transit geometry and on the luminosity drop produced by an object on the line of sight to the star , which approximates to : @xmath132 under the assumption of a uniform surface brightness of the star .",
    "strictly the effect includes a dependence on the local surface brightness of the stellar disk , which varies with radius due to ` limb darkening ' : moving radially outwards towards the stellar limb the line of sight passes through increasing atmospheric depth ( cf.equation  1 of @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . for a central transit across a star with a limb - darkening coefficient of 0.6 ,",
    "the maximum brightness drop is 25% larger than given by equation  [ equ : photom ] .",
    "since limb - darkening is wavelength dependent , a planetary event will also cause a small colour change ( @xcite ) .",
    "values of @xmath133 for the earth , mars , and jupiter transiting the sun are @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 respectively .",
    "if the radius of the star can be estimated from , say , spectral classification , then @xmath137 can be estimated from equation  [ equ : photom ] .",
    "with knowledge of @xmath47 and an estimate of @xmath79 ( also from spectral classification or via evolutionary models ) , @xmath48 can be derived from kepler s law .",
    "other observational parameters are given , to first order , by simple geometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the duration of the transit is : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the latitude of the transit on the stellar disk , giving a transit period of about 25  hr for a jupiter - type planet and 13  hr for an earth - type system , results rather insensitive to @xmath48 ( @xcite ) . with the other parameters estimated as above ,",
    "@xmath139 can be derived from equation  [ equ : duration ] , and hence the orbital inclination from @xmath140 .",
    "the minimum inclination where transits can occur is given by @xmath141 , with the probability of observing transits for a randomly oriented system of @xmath142 .",
    "evaluation of @xmath50 and @xmath46 for realistic cases demonstrates that @xmath50 must be very close to @xmath143 , while @xmath46 is very small .",
    "the principal disadvantage of the method is that it requires configurations in which the viewing direction ( to the earth ) lies in the orbital plane of the planet .",
    "this time - independent geometrical alignment therefore occurs with only very low probability , such that surveys without _ a priori _ knowledge of system geometry or orbital period and orbital phase are characterised by very low detection probabilities .",
    "prospects can be improved by pre - selecting stars whose planetary companions are likely to have their orbital planes perpendicular to the plane of the sky , for example stars whose rotation axis can be inferred to lie in this plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is to focus attention on eclipsing binary systems whose geometry implies @xmath144 , although this in turn relies on the further assumption that the planetary and binary orbital planes are co - aligned ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "configurations in which the planet orbits one component of a widely - separated binary , or is in orbit around a close binary , are possible , with both resulting in large domains of dynamical stability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that when applied to eclipsing binaries the method leads to the possibility of detecting planets with radii around 10000 km ( @xmath145 ) with a rather large probability and a fairly good precision in the orbital period .",
    "thus , observations of the smallest known eclipsing binary , cm  dra with a period of 1.28  days , should allow the detection of terrestrial - sized inner planets ( 1.52.78@xmath146 ) , if they exist around this system , using ground - based 1-m class telescopes over several months .",
    "this programme has been pursued by the tep ( transits of extra - solar planets ) network since 1994 , using six  telescopes located around the world ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "timing of the binary eclipse minima provides a planet detection sensitivity down to about @xmath41 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ground - based photometry to better than about 0.1% accuracy is complicated by variable atmospheric extinction , while scintillation , the rapidly varying turbulent refocusing of rays passing through the atmosphere , imposes limits at about 0.01% .",

    "the first 23  years is to be devoted to stellar seismology , aiming to detect solar - type acoustic oscillations in stars in the nearest open clusters .",

    "about 50000 stars will be monitored , with photometric precision between @xmath151 and @xmath152 for @xmath153  mag and 1  hour integration times .",
    "these values imply a low probability of discovering transits of earth - class planets in the habitable zone , but give an increased probability for planets which are slightly larger , or closer to their central star , such that several detection of planets with 2@xmath146 are expected .",

    "photometric variations for @xmath72  pictoris have been attributed to either a planetary passage or a dust cloud , the latter explanation probably requiring a cometary tail ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of these studies is evident in the context of comet models for our own solar system ( @xcite ) .",
    "even satellites of extra - solar planets , and planetary rings appear detectable by this method ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have derived detection probabilities , and give illustrative examples of transit light curves , evaluating the combination of geometric conditions ( orbital inclination angle such that it will transit the star ) and orbital conditions ( determined by the location of the planet ) , with and without an accompanying transit of the parent planet .",
    "the planet - satellite transits also constrain the period and orbital radius of the satellite .",
    "even if the satellite is not extended enough to produce a detectable signal in the stellar light curve , it may still be detected indirectly through the rotation of the planet around the barycentre of the planet - satellite system , although this necessarily requires that a planetary transit be observed at least 3  times .",
    "@xcite showed that corot could detect or exclude satellites much smaller than those photometrically detectable , for example with radius @xmath154 around a jupiter - like planet .",
    "the prospects for transit spectroscopy and imaging are discussed by @xcite .",
    "an important recent result has been the detection of the first extra - solar planetary transit event , observed by @xcite and independently by @xcite for hd  209458 , a planet with small  @xmath48 , and one of the most recent of the radial velocity detections .",
    "@xcite observed two well - defined transits ( figure  [ fig : charbonneau ] ) , of duration about 2.5  hours , providing an orbital period consistent with the radial velocity determination , and confirming beyond any doubt that its radial velocity variations arise from an orbiting planet .",
    "the importance of this result and the relative strength of the transit signal have resulted in a number of independent confirmations of transits for hd  209458 , including the detection of the transit signals in the hipparcos astrometry satellite s photometric data from 199093 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the physical information about this planet that can be inferred from this measurement are described in section  [ sec : hd209458 ] .",
    "the realisation that stars may be accompanied by close - in planets yielding measurable transit signatures has led to the development of dedicated systems to monitor specific fields , which can be based on small - aperture optics : stare , a 10  cm instrument used for the first detection of the hd  209458 transits by @xcite , is monitoring some 24000 stars in a 5.7  degree square field in the constellation of auriga ; asp ( arizona search for planets ) uses a 20  cm aperture in a similar manner ; and asas ( all - sky automated survey ) has as its goal the photometric monitoring of @xmath155 stars brighter than 14  mag over the entire sky , making more than 100 3-min exposures per night .",
    "such searches should soon extend the detection of transits to later spectral types ( cooler , less massive k and m stars ) than the sun - like ( f and g - type ) stars favoured in the radial velocity surveys , in which the transit effect should be more pronounced due to the smaller stellar size .",
    "observations of more than @xmath156 stars in the globular cluster 47  tucanae , uniformally sampled over 9  days by the hubble space telescope in july 1999 , may result in several tens of transit detections if such planets exist in globular clusters ( @xcite ) , although preliminary analysis for @xmath157 stars has revealed no convincing planet candidates ( @xcite ) .",
    "1520 detections would have been expected if the occurrence rate in 47  tuc were the same as indicated by radial velocity searches in the solar neighbourhood ; the discrepancy suggests that at least one of the processes of formation , migration , or survival of close - in planets may be significantly altered in the cluster environment .",
    "equation  [ equ : imaging ] indicates that @xmath158 . for planets very close to the central star ,",
    "a modulation due to the ( doppler shifted ) reflected light intensity could therefore be expected , even if the planet can not be imaged as such ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this may still occur even if the orbital plane is somewhat inclined to the line of site , with a signature dependent upon inclination ( no modulation would be observed for face - on systems ) .",

    "the system has been studied by @xcite .",
    "the spectrum should contain a secondary component which varies in amplitude depending on the adopted functional form for the phase variation and scattering law , with the planet s radial velocity relative to the star reaching a maximum amplitude of @xmath163kms@xmath86 .",
    "the system appears to be tidally locked ( cf .",
    "equation  1 of @xcite ) , in which case there is no relative motion between the planet and star surfaces .",
    "the planet should therefore reflect a non - rotationally broadened stellar spectrum , yielding relatively narrow planetary lines dominated only by the stellar photospheric convective motions , superimposed on much broader stellar lines .",
    "no evidence for a highly reflective planet was found , yielding a geometric albedo @xmath164 ( assuming @xmath165 , and with a weak dependence on the assumed orbital inclination ) , compared to values of 0.390.60 for the solar system giant planets .",

    "since a microlensed source has two ( generally unresolved ) images , their centroid makes a small excursion ( typically by a fraction of a milliarcsec ) around the trajectory of the source as a result of varying magnification and image positions during lensing ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the astrometric manifestation has two advantages over photometric microlensing .",

    "an alternative interpretation was given by @xcite .",
    "they were able to model their ( independent ) 46 v - band and 325-i band observations , with a fit consistent with the @xcite data , with a lens consisting of a rotating binary star , having a total lens mass @xmath202 , a mass ratio @xmath203 , a lens distance of @xmath204  kpc , and a binary period of @xmath205  yr , leading to a change in binary separation of @xmath206 and in orientation by 561  @xmath207  036 during the 35.2  days between the separate caustic transits ( figure  [ fig : albrow ] ) .",

    "section  [ sec : planet - formation ] underlines the intimate connection between protoplanetary disks and the planets which are formed from them . a short discussion of disks",
    "is included here partly because of the evidence that the observation of protoplanetary disks brings to bear on the understanding of planetary formation , but also because the distinction between the detection of disks and the detection of planets is becoming smaller .",
    "in contrast to the observational difficulties for planets , it is now relatively easy to observe disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "not only are they extremely large  a typical disk extends to of order 1000  au from the star  but the surface area of the small particles which make up the disk is many orders of magnitude larger than that of a planet .",
    "they emit and reflect light very well , and can be seen to relatively large distances from the central star with modern telescopes .",
    "disks also appear to be long - lived , @xmath208  years , and robust against disruption by the events that commonly accompany early stellar evolution .",
    "they are remarkably common throughout our galaxy , and their properties appear quite similar to the picture of our primitive solar nebula ( section  [ sec : planet - formation ] ) .",
    "they are particularly evident due to their strong emission at infrared red wavelengths , between about 2  @xmath18 m and 1  mm , with a spectrum much broader than any single - temperature black body , originating from thermal emission over a wide variation of temperatures , from @xmath209  k very close to the stars to @xmath210  k near the outer edges of the disks at several hundred  au from the central star .",
    "the star @xmath72  pic is a prototype ( see @xcite for a review ) , discovered from observations of the iras ( infrared ) satellite , in which the innermost parts of the disk appear to be devoid of gas and dust , and with the absence of diffuse material suggesting the presence of planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "cometary - like bodies ( @xcite ) , perturbations of a planet on the disk ( @xcite ) , and light variations possibly associated with planets ( @xcite ; @xcite and references ) have all been reported for this system .",
    "in contrast to @xmath72  pic , most disks occur around young stars , in particular around t  tauri stars which lie close to star - forming clouds , and with an excess of infrared emission most likely arising from dusty material in orbit around , and heated by , the central star .",
    "calculations imply that the disk phase of planetary formation lasts for only a relatively small fraction of a system s total lifetime , although some stars may maintain disks for a billion years or more , perhaps never forming any planets .",
    "many disks have been detected through their infrared , sub - mm , or radio emission , frequently showing a roughly flattened shape , with doppler measurements indicating rotation .",
    "dust disks have been observed around some 100 main - sequence stars within 50  pc of the sun ( @xcite ) , for example , around the binary bd  + 31@xmath211643 ( @xcite ) ; @xmath212  eridani ( @xcite ) ; hr  4796 ( @xcite ) ; the pre - main sequence binary hk  tauri ( @xcite ) , and around hd  98800 , a very young bright planetary debris system bearing a strong similarity to the zodiacal dust bands in our own solar system ( @xcite ) .",

    "recently are the observations of a disk around @xmath213  cnc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a number of disk systems have been imaged using the hubble space telescope ( @xcite ) , including @xmath72  pic ( figure  [ fig : hst - disk]a ; @xcite ) . in the case of hd  141569 ( figure  [ fig : hst - disk]b , @xcite ) ,",
    "the star is at a distance of about 100  pc , and has an age of about @xmath214  years .",
    "outwards from the centre , a bright inner region is separated from a fainter outer region by a dark band , superficially resembling the cassini division ( the largest gap ) in saturn s rings .",
    "the disk extends to about 400  au , about 13 times the diameter of neptune s orbit , with the gap at 250  au .",
    "an unseen planet may have carved out the gap , in which case its mass can be estimated at @xmath215 , and its orbital period as 2600  years .",
    "if it takes @xmath216 orbital periods to clear such material ( @xcite ) then the gap could be opened in @xmath217  years , consistent with the age of the star . in the case of hr",

    "the colour of the material ( from infrared measurements at 1.1 and 1.6  @xmath18 m ) implies particles with a size of a few  @xmath18 m , larger than typical interstellar grains .",
    "the implied confinement of material also argues for dynamical constraints on the particles by one or more as yet unseen bodies .    a number of recent reviews of disk formation cover issues such as angular momentum transport in disks in the context of the psr  1257 + 12 pulsar planet system ( @xcite ) ; the angular momentum evolution of young stars and disks , including the effects of magnetic breaking , fragmentation during protostar collapse , and viscosity ( @xcite ) ; protostars and circumstellar disks ( @xcite ) ; the origin of protoplanetary disks ( @xcite ) ; circumstellar disks ( @xcite ) ; and extra - solar planets and migration ( @xcite ) .      @xcite has considered the direct detectability of planets during the short but unique epoch of giant impacts during the late stages of planetary formation ( section  [ sec : planet - formation ] ) .",
    "massive accreting pairs , with masses of order @xmath218 , would deposit sufficient energy to turn their surfaces molten and temporarily render them much more luminous at infrared wavelengths ( ocean vaporisation or radiation to space dominate according to mass ) .",
    "this occurs even for low - velocity approaches ( i.e.  for co - planar , zero - eccentricity orbits at 1  au ) , the gravitational attraction leading to impact velocities of around 10  km  s@xmath86 . a luminous 15002500  k photosphere persisting for some @xmath219  years",
    "could be created for a terrestrial - mass planet ( massive impacts on giant planets would be more luminous but shorter lived ) leading to an estimate of 1/250 young stars affected .",
    "detection was estimated to require 12  nights of observing time per object .",
    "super - flares have been observed around a number of otherwise normal f  g main sequence stars .",
    "these are stellar flares with energies of @xmath220  erg , @xmath221 times more energetic than the largest solar flares , with durations of hours to days and visible from x - ray to optical frequencies ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have proposed that they are caused by magnetic reconnection between fields of the primary star and a close - in jovian planet , in close analogy with flaring in rs  cvn binary systems .",
    "if the companion has a magnetic dipole moment of adequate strength , the magnetic field lines connecting the pair will be wrapped by orbital motion , leading to an increase in magnetic field strength .",
    "interaction of specific field loops with the passing planet will initiate reconnection events .",
    "super - flares on our own sun , which would be catastrophic for life on earth , would not be expected since our solar system does not have a planet with a large magnetic dipole moment in a close orbit .",
    "only one super - flare star , @xmath222  ceti , has been searched for planets to date , and the presence of a saturn - mass planet is so far not excluded .",
    "the connection between super - flares and planets is presently conjectural .",
    "if extra - solar planets possess a substantial magnetic field , coherent cyclotron radio emission could be driven by the stellar wind / magnetospheric interaction , as observed in our solar system , perhaps episodically at the planetary rotation period ( @xcite ) .",
    "model results indicate that the most favourable candidate is presently @xmath159  boo , but with an expected mean amplitude of about 2  jy at 28  mhz , a factor of 100 below current detectability limits",
    ".    one terminal stage of the planet may be its spiraling in and eventual accretion onto the central star ( section  [ sec : formation - revisited ] ) .",
    "modeling has been carried out for accretion onto asymptotic giant branch stars ( @xcite ) and onto solar - mass stars located on the red giant branch ( @xcite ) . in the latter case",
    "observational signatures that accompany the engulfing of the planet include ejection of a shell and a subsequent phase of infrared emission , increase in the @xmath223li surface abundance , spin - up of the star because of the deposition of orbital angular momentum , and the possible generation of magnetic fields and the related x - ray activity caused by the development of shears at the base of the convective envelope .",
    "infrared excess and high li abundances are observed in 48% of g and k stars , and @xcite postulate that these signatures might originate from the accretion of a giant planet , a brown dwarf , or a very low - mass stars ( see also section  [ sec : host - properties ] ) .",

    "in contrast , their analyses suggest that for solar - type stars , the orbital properties of their low - mass companions in general ( i.e.  whether massive planets , brown dwarfs or stars ) are rather homogeneous .",
    "thus @xcite find that extra - solar planets and brown dwarfs share a common probability distribution function for orbital periods and eccentricities , a common period - eccentricity correlation , and the same lack of a significant mass - eccentricity correlation .",
    "the combined population displays orbital element statistics very similar to that of compatible stellar companions .",
    "the results are confirmed using a much larger sample of about 400  compatible stellar companions derived from the survey of 3347 g  dwarfs by @xcite ( stepinski , private communication ) .",
    "@xcite raise the question of whether the properties of the present sample of extra - solar planets , which appear peculiar when viewed from the perspective of the standard model of planet formation , could appear more natural in the context of a population related to stellar companions ( see section  [ sec : formation - revisited ] ) .",

    "if the three planets all have the same inclinations , masses of the inner two planets of @xmath236 and @xmath237 would follow .",

    "the ` hill stability ' criterion requires that the planets approach no closer than their hill radius ( or tidal radius ) .",
    "the system stability therefore depends strongly on the planetary masses , and hence orbital inclination , since the orbits of the second and third planets brings their relative separation close to their hill radius , a proximity that would make their motion chaotic .",
    "a number of numerical studies have been carried out to establish whether the system is stable over long time scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , confirming that for all except extreme values of @xmath238 ( ruled out by the hipparcos astrometry ) , most plausible orbits are stable for the 23  gyr age of the system .",
    "numerical integration by @xcite suggest that the two outer planets experience extremely chaotic evolution , that the system tends to favour configurations in which the two outer planets exhibit a significant relative inclination ( @xmath239 ) , and that the eccentricity of the outer orbit is unlikely to be much larger than  0.3 .",
    "the considerable eccentricity of the outermost planet is difficult to excite through @xmath240-body interactions arising from a set of initially circular orbits .",
    "the inner planet , with @xmath241 , significantly exceeds the minimum stability criterion , suggesting little interaction with the outer two companions .",
    "the outer two planets , in contrast , have high eccentricities , underlining the observational trend for single systems , and suggesting that planet - planet interactions constitute a plausible explanation for the orbital evolution of this system .",
    "if such interactions are the dominant source of orbital evolution , additional companion planets should ultimately be detected in most of the currently known systems . alternatively ,",
    "if planetary - disk interactions are dominant , multiple systems like @xmath104  and might be relatively rare .",
    "the planet around 16  cyg  b has an orbit which is particularly eccentric , @xmath242 .",
    "16  cyg  b is one component of a widely separated binary star system whose eccentricity is itself very large , @xmath243 .",
    "the orbital period of the binary star is very long , and therefore difficult to measure accurately , but from astrometric observations made over about 170  years is estimated to be @xmath24418000  yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "it provides an interesting test case for planetary formation theories which try to explain these large eccentricities , perhaps through gravitational perturbations imposed by the stellar component 16  cyg  a. if the planet was originally formed in a circular orbit , with an orbital plane inclined to that of the stellar binary by @xmath24445@xmath211 , then the planet orbit oscillates chaotically between high- and low - eccentricity states , on time scales of @xmath245  yr , as long as there are no other planets with @xmath246 within 30  au ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although other highly eccentric planetary systems are not known to be associated with stellar binaries , and therefore the relationship between high eccentricity and stellar binarity is unlikely to be one - to - one , perturbations caused by 16  cyg  a remain a plausible cause of its high eccentricity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the host stars in table  [ tab : known - planets ] cover a mass range of @xmath247 ( and lower for the k ",
    "m dwarfs ) , and a broad age range ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    ". detailed spectroscopic analyses of the parent stars have been carried out ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on average ,",
    "stars hosting planets have significantly higher metal content ( elements heavier than he ) , compared to the average solar - type star in the solar neighbourhood , although some are metal poor . for",
    "the subset of close - in giants , @xcite conclude the parent stars are all metal rich ; values of [ fe / h ]  =  0.45 for @xmath213  55  cnc and 14  her place them amongst the most metal - rich stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this suggests that their physical parameters are affected by the process that formed the planet ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are two leading hypotheses to explain the connection between high metallicity and the presence of planets : high metallicity may favour the formation of rocky planets ( and large rocky cores of gas giants ) as a result of excess solid material in the protoplanetary disk : essentially the metals make condensation easier . alternatively , as originally formulated to explain the high li content of certain stars ( @xcite ; li  being rapidly destroyed even at relatively low temperatures ) , the high metallicity could be due to the capture of metal - rich disk material by the star during its early history ( @xcite ) , and possibly even to capture of the planet itself ( @xcite ) as a natural consequence of the migration scenario ( section  [ sec : formation - revisited ] ) .",
    "a planet added to a fully convective star would be folded into the entire stellar mass and would lead to a negligible metallicity enhancement . however , main - sequence solar mass stars like the sun have radiative cores with relatively small outer convection zones which comprise only a few percent of the stellar mass .",
    "planet capture can therefore significantly enhance the heavy element content in the convective zone ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . a capture event may influence orbital migration of remaining planets in the systems due to changes in angular momentum and magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the process of migration via the ejection of planetesimals is important ( @xcite ) , many particles can be trapped in the 3:1 or 4:1 resonances , and then pumped into high enough eccentricites that they impact the star , leading to metallicity enrichment and the production of evaporating bodies which may be detectable as transient absorption lines in young stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "radial velocity searches have concentrated on f  k stars .",
    "stars earlier than  f5 have fast rotation making precision radial velocity measurements impossible ( this rotational discontinuity may be associated with planetary formation ) , while m  dwarfs have lower luminosities and relatively few have been surveyed . of these , gliese  876 is the nearest known planetary system , at 4.7  pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "results so far suggest that planet formation is not restricted to more massive stars , and given that m  dwarfs outnumber g  dwarfs by a factor of 10 , most planets in our galaxy may orbit stars whose luminosity and mass are significantly lower than the sun s .      aside from orbital data from radial velocity measurements , specific planetary characteristics",
    "are presently limited .",
    "however , the recent detection of photometric transits for hd  209458 ( section  [ sec : photometry ] ) provides additional important information .    the precise shape of the transit curve is determined by five parameters ( @xcite ) : the planetary and stellar radii , the stellar mass , the orbital inclination @xmath50 , and the limb - darkening parameter . for",
    "assumed values of @xmath137 and @xmath50 the relative flux change can be calculated at each phase , by integrating the flux occulted by a planet of given radius at the correct projected location on the limb - darkened disk .",

    "the radius is in excellent agreement with the predictions ( for a gas giant made mainly of hydrogen ) of @xcite , who calculated radii for a strongly irradiated radiative / convective extra - solar planet as a function of mass .",
    "being the first extra - solar planet of known radius and mass , several important physical quantities can be derived for the first time : @xcite estimate @xmath253gm@xmath254 , significantly less dense than saturn , the least dense of the solar system gas giants .",
    "the surface gravity is @xmath255ms@xmath256 .",
    "assuming an effective temperature for the star of 6000  k , the effective temperature of the planet is @xmath257k where @xmath46 is the albedo .",
    "this implies a thermal velocity for hydrogen of @xmath258kms@xmath86 , a factor  7 less than the calculated escape velocity of @xmath259kms@xmath86 , confirming that these planets should not be losing significant amounts of mass due to the effects of stellar insolation .",
    "further physical diagnostics of this and other systems will soon become available . in the case of hd  209458 , other planets or moons in the system",
    "could be detected from more accurate transit data , if they exist , down to masses of @xmath260 at 0.2  au , or down to @xmath261 from space observations .",
    "given the orbital inclination , planets beyond about 0.1  au from the star will show no transits if the orbits are co - aligned . detection of reflected light would yield the planet s albedo directly since the radius is accurately known .",
    "observations at wavelengths longer than a few @xmath18 m may detect the secondary eclipse as the planet passes behind the star , yielding the planet s dayside temperature , and hence constraining the mean atmospheric absorptivity . high - accuracy differential spectroscopy in and out of transit may eventually lead to the observation of absorption features added by the planetary atmosphere .",
    "the extra - solar main - sequence planets discovered so far are all more massive than saturn , and most either orbit very close to their stars or travel on much more eccentric paths than any of the major planets in our solar system .",
    "the present small sample can be divided broadly into three groups ( without necessarily implying a clear distinction or different formation process between them ) : jupiter analogues , in terms of  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 , and with low eccentricities ( such as 47  uma ) ; planets with highly eccentric orbits ( such as 70  vir ) ; and close - in giants ( or ` hot jupiters ' ) within 0.1  au whose orbits are largely circular ( such as 51  peg ) . while the jupiter analogues can be explained satisfactorily by",
    "` standard theories ' ( section  [ sec : planet - formation ] ) , the other orbits provide more of a challenge for formation theories .",
    "a robust formation mechanism must explain the mass distribution , the large eccentricities , and the large number of orbits with @xmath262  au , where both high temperature and relatively small amount of protostellar matter available for their agglomeration would inhibit formation _ in situ _ ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    if the analyses by @xcite and @xcite indeed point to a common origin for the extra - solar planet and brown dwarf populations , somehow related to the population of stellar companions , then the standard model of planet formation , or certain features of the standard model , may prove to be inadequate .",
    "a formation scenario in which global gravitational instabilities in circumstellar disks yield binaries with a range of separations ( between @xmath263 and 100  au ) and masses ( perhaps subsequently modified by mass transfer ) may then be indicated ( @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile , most theoretical efforts have so far been directed at developing modifications of the standard model necessary to reconcile it with the observed system properties .",
    "thus the existence of the close - in planets has focussed attention on some earlier predictions that jupiter - mass systems ( gas giants ) could be formed further from the star , followed by non - destructive migration inwards .",
    "this inward migration could be driven by tidal interactions with the protoplanetary disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and subject to tidal circularization in the process ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "radial migration is caused by inward torques between the planet and the disk , by outward torques between the planet and the spinning star , and by outward torques due to roche lobe overflow and consequent mass loss from the planet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inward migration could accompany the disk material accreting onto the young star due to viscosity within the disk , or the migrating planet could lose angular momentum to the disk and fall inwards even if the disk were not itself draining inwards .",
    "the discovery of many systems with small orbital radius provides a further complication : orbital migration time - scale is proportional to the orbital period , which should lead to rapid orbital decay for successively smaller orbits .",
    "this suggests that inward migration is halted at some point until the disk evaporates .",
    "alternatively , gravitational encounters between planets in a post - disk environment could perturb a planet into an orbit with a very small periastron distance , following which tidal interactions with the host star could circularize the orbit ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent theories and numerical simulations have examined orbital migration , halting mechanisms , and the origin of orbital eccentricities as part of the overall formation scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "explanations for halting the inward migration include the progressive raising of tidal bulges in the star that will transfer angular momentum from the star to the planetary orbit ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , holes in the protoplanetary disk could be cleared by the star s rotating magnetic field , which could entrain the hot gas , either distributing it outward , or channeling it onto the star along the magnetic field lines ( although such a mechanism can not explain the planets around @xmath213  55  cnc or @xmath224  crb , which orbit at @xmath264  au , too distant for the magnetic field to clear a hole ) .",
    "once the planet emerges from the inner edge of the disk , the inward tidal torques vanish because the surface density is negligible , and inward migration stops .",
    "@xcite have considered a mechanism involving mass loss through the planet s roche lobe as the giant planet migrates inwards , leading to mass transfer from the planet to the star and movement outward by conservation of angular momentum .",
    "stable mass transfer is achieved at a distance where its radius equals its roche radius , and small stable orbits will result if the disk is dissipated before the planet loses all its mass .",
    "our own jupiter and the rest of the solar system planets may be those bodies left stranded when the last of the protoplanetary disk cleared out .    since orbital migration in a viscous gaseous environment",
    "is expected to preserve circular orbits , the frequent occurrence of high orbital eccentricity has led to a distinct class of models in which these systems must be commonly produced .",
    "current attention is directed at models involving interactions with : ( a ) other orbiting planets ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; ( b ) the protoplanetary accretion disk ( @xcite ) , in which the proto - planet exerts gravitational forces on the disk that launch spiral density waves , which in turn exert subtle forces back on the planet , pulling it away from pure circular motion , an effect which can build up over millions of years ; ( c ) a companion star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; ( d ) stellar encounters in a young star cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "note the possibility that the non - circular orbits all arise from perturbations from a bound companion star , as proposed for 16  cyg  b ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , rather than from the intrinsic dynamics of the planet formation .",
    "increasingly realistic simulations of evolving planetary systems have been made possible through improved physical models and developments in computer speed and computational algorithms .",
    "@xcite have constructed models beginning with thousands of protoplanets embedded in a gas / dust disk , and evolved over several gyr until orbital stability is achieved .",
    "planet - planet interactions typically determine the final stable architecture of a given system , and many of their model systems resemble , for example , the @xmath104  and multiple system .",
    "orbit crossings and global instabilities among planets in the disk can lead to dramatic orbit changes and large eccentricities . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have modelled disk accretion onto high - mass planets demonstrating the formation of a gap , but with mass flow possible through it , suggesting that the opening of a gap around a planet does not always terminate its growth .",
    "figure  [ fig : lin - simulations ] shows results of simulations of disk - planet interactions and tidal interactions with the central star by @xcite .",
    "current theories suggest that it is very difficult to collect all the matter from a disk into a single planet ; if the companions to other stars were indeed formed from disks , they are quite likely to be members of more extensive planetary systems .",
    "although presently there is little information on multiple systems , and no information on planets beyond 3  au , this will change as radial velocity programmes extend their temporal baseline : future results might reveal , for example , a population of planets residing in predominantly circular orbits which have never experienced significant scattering or migration . or",
    "they might reveal additional giant planets for all systems with giant planets within 3  au , as expected from dynamical evolution scenarios that involve mutual perturbations .",
    "given that the sun s planets are all either low in mass , or orbit at larger distances , and are therefore more difficult to discover using the doppler technique , it is even possible that many planetary systems will turn out to be like our own .",
    "predicted spectral properties of extra - solar planets were made in advance of their discovery , giving brightness versus mass and age ( @xcite ) , and including sensitivity to parameters such as deuterium and helium abundance , rotation rate , and presence of a rock - ice core ( @xcite ) .",
    "models have been updated subsequently , including effects of the outer radiative zones caused by the strong external heating which inhibits atmospheric convection . for giants at the very small orbital distances of 51  peg , one hundred times closer to its primary than jupiter , @xcite calculated radii and luminosities for a range of compositions ( h / he , he , h@xmath16o , and mg@xmath16sio@xmath17 ) .",
    "they showed that such a planet is stable to classical jeans evaporation , and to photodissociation and mass loss due to extreme ultraviolet radiation , even for tidally - locked planets , finding a mass loss rate for a gas giant at 0.05  au of about @xmath265  yr@xmath86 .",
    "hydrostatic evolution calculations and atmospheric models , including radiative effects , are being used to determine structures , radii ( e.g.  corresponding to 10  bar ) , equilibrium temperatures , luminosities ( emitted and reflected ) , colours , and spectra of objects with temperatures from 1300  k down to 100  k ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these will help to classify and characterise the planets as more information about them becomes available .",
    "evolutionary models in the luminosity / effective temperature ( @xmath266 ) plane show , for example , that a few million years after their formation , the temperatures of planets that are massive , young , or not substantially heated by their parent star , begin to decrease , and the planets thereafter evolve at almost constant radius ( @xcite ) . the close - in , short - period planets are heated by the star such that their atmosphere can not cool substantially .",
    "the longer period planets have a maximum radius at about 4@xmath1 : for higher masses @xmath137 decreases due to electron degeneracy ; lower mass planets are smaller because their lower mass more than compensates for their lower density .",
    "the situation changes as stellar heating becomes significant : less massive planets are larger because their gravity is not large enough to counter thermal expansion .",
    "treatment of the close - in planets experiencing strong stellar irradiation , using detailed radiative transfer solutions to describe the interaction of the flux from the parent star at all relevant depths of the planetary atmosphere , has been carried out by @xcite . compared with an isolated planet with the same effective temperature , h@xmath16 rayleigh scattering in dust - free models increases the planet s emission significantly shortward of ca  h and k at 393  nm , while inclusion of the effects of dust , formed high in their atmospheres , increases the reflected light in the blue .",
    "detailed theoretical photometric ( reflected ) light curves and polarization curves for these close - in planets are now being derived ( @xcite ) .",
    "the broad range of estimated equilibrium temperatures , from around 200  k in the case of 47  uma to around 1500  k in the case of @xmath159  bootis , signifies planetary atmospheres very different from each other , and from the planetary atmospheres in our solar system , with important consequences for their composition and therefore their spectral appearance ( figure  [ fig : burrows ] ) . with increasing temperature , chemical species likely to condense near the photosphere range from nh@xmath71 , h@xmath16o , and nh@xmath17cl at the lowest temperatures , up to mns , mgsio@xmath71 , and fe at the highest .",
    "@xcite have proposed dividing the giant planets into four albedo classes , corresponding to four broad effective temperature ranges : a ` jovian ' class with tropospheric ammonia clouds ( @xmath267  k ) ; a ` water cloud ' class primarily affected by condensed h@xmath16o ( @xmath268  k ) ; a clear class lacking cloud ( @xmath269  k ) ; and a high - temperature class for which alkali metal absorption predominates ( @xmath270  k ) . an accurate prediction of condensation in the atmospheres is important , since the presence of clouds and aerosols has a major influence on albedos .",
    "planets with significant cloud cover are expected to reflect most of the stellar light ( high albedo ) , hence reducing their infrared luminosity , but increasing the amount of reflected stellar radiation .",
    "when only rare species condense , the albedo will be small , and the effective temperature and infrared luminosity will be high .    as an example of the complexities faced in the modeling , h@xmath16o can form visible clouds in the range @xmath271  k , which will strongly affect the planetary spectrum and albedo ( @xcite ) . at higher temperatures , water would not be in vapour form , and would therefore not form clouds , but would still affect the spectrum significantly . at lower temperatures , water would condense too deep in the atmosphere to be detected by spectroscopy ( as is the case for saturn , with @xmath272  k ) .",
    "the search for other planets is motivated by efforts to understand their formation mechanism and , by analogy , to gain an improved understanding of the formation of our own solar system .",
    "search accuracies will progressively improve to the point that the detection of telluric planets in the ` habitable zone ' will become feasible , and there is presently no reason to assume that such planets will not exist in very large numbers .",
    "improvements in spectroscopic measurements , whether from earth or space , and developments of atmospheric modelling , will lead to searches for planets which are progressively habitable , inhabited by micro - organisms , and ultimately by intelligent life ( these searches may or may not prove fruitless ) .",
    "search strategies will be assisted by improved understanding of the conditions required for development of life on earth ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) combined with observational feasibility ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this will be a cross - disciplinary effort , with the participation of astronomers , chemists and biologists .",
    "the last few years has seen the establishment of a number of exo - biology initiatives ( e.g.  @xcite ) and numerous conferences on the search for life ( e.g.   @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , beginning to quantify philosophical debate that has been ongoing for centuries ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this section only touches upon some of these considerations .",
    "assessment of the suitability of a planet for supporting life , or habitability , is based on our knowledge of life on earth . with the general consensus among biologists that carbon - based life requires water for its self - sustaining chemical reactions ( @xcite ) , the search for habitable planets has therefore focused on identifying environments in which liquid water is stable over billions of years , as required for the development of advanced life on earth .",
    "habitability over early geological time scales is complex and poorly understood , but its atmosphere is thought to have experienced an evolution in the greenhouse blanket of co@xmath16 and h@xmath16o to accommodate the 30% increase in the sun s luminosity over the last 4.6  billion years in order to sustain the presence of liquid water evident from geological records ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the future , the sun will increase to roughly three times its present luminosity by the time it leaves the main sequence , in about 5  gyr .",
    "the habitable zone is consequently presently defined by the range of distances from a star where liquid water can exist on the planet s surface ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is primarily controlled by the star - planet separation , but is affected by factors such as planet rotation combined with atmospheric convection ( models for tidally locked , synchronous rotators , are given by @xcite ) . for earth - like planets orbiting main - sequence stars ,",
    "the inner edge is bounded by water loss and the runaway greenhouse effect , as exemplified by the co@xmath16-rich atmosphere and resulting temperature of venus .",
    "the outer boundary is determined by co@xmath16 condensation and runaway glaciation , but it may be extended outwards by factors such as internal heat sources including long - lived radionuclides ( u@xmath273 , u@xmath274 , k@xmath275 etc .",
    ", as on earth , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , tidal heating due to gravitational interactions ( as in the case of jupiter s moon io ) , and pressure - induced far - infrared opacity of h@xmath16 , since even for effective temperatures as low as 30  k , atmospheric basal temperatures can exceed the melting point of water ( @xcite ) .",
    "these considerations result , for a @xmath276 star , in an inner habitability boundary at about 0.7  au and an outer boundary at around 1.5  au or beyond ( some authors give a more restricted range ) .",
    "the habitable zone evolves outwards with time because of the increasing sun s luminosity with age , resulting in a narrower width of the continuously habitable zone over @xmath277  gyr of around 0.951.15  au .",
    "positive feedback due to the greenhouse effect and planetary albedo variations , and negative feedback due to the link between atmospheric co@xmath16 level and surface temperature may limit these boundaries further ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "migration of the habitable zone to much larger distances , 550  au , during the short period of post - main - sequence evolution corresponding to the subgiant and red giant phases , has been considered by @xcite .    within the @xmath65  au habitability zone ,",
    "earth ` class ' planets can be considered as those with masses between about 0.510@xmath39 or , equivalently , radii between 0.82.2@xmath146 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "planets below this mass in the habitable zone are likely to lose their life - supporting atmospheres because of their low gravity and lack of plate tectonics , while more massive systems are unlikely to be habitable because they can attract a hydrogen - helium atmosphere and become gas giants .",
    "habitability is also likely to be governed by the range of stellar types for which life has enough time to evolve , i.e.  stars not more massive than spectral type  a. however , even f  stars have narrower continuously habitable zones because they evolve more rapidly , while late k and m stars may not host habitable planets because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation due to tidal damping .",
    "mid- to early - k and g stars may therefore be optimal for the development of life ( @xcite ) .",
    "simulations of the formation of habitable systems , within the framework of models of planet formation in general and our solar system in particular , are given for example by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other effects complicate considerations of habitability : in the absence of our moon , thought to be an accident of accretion , an earth - like planet would undergo large - amplitude chaotic fluctuations due to secular resonances ( spin - axis / orbit axis or spin - axis precession / perihelion precession ) on time scales of order 10  myr , depending also on the planet s land - sea distribution",
    ". these motions would result in large local temperature excursions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) although perhaps not precluding the accompanying migration of life .",
    "@xcite argued that large - scale biological activity on a telluric planet necessarily produces a large quantity of o@xmath16 .",
    "photosynthesis builds organic molecules from co@xmath16 , with the help of h@xmath278 ions which can be provided from different sources . in the case of oxygenic bacteria on earth ,",
    "h@xmath278 ions are provided by the photodissociation of h@xmath16o , in which case oxygen is produced as a by - product . however",
    ", this is not the case for anoxygenic bacteria , and thus o@xmath16 is to be considered as a possible but not a necessary by - product of life .",
    "indeed , earth s atmosphere was o@xmath16-free until about 2  billion years ago , suppressed for more than 1.5  billion years after life originated ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite noted the possibility , quantified by @xcite based on transit measurements , of using the 760-nm band of oxygen as a spectroscopic tracer of life on another planet since , being highly reactive with reducing rocks and volcanic gases , it would disappear in a short time in the absence of a continuous production mechanism .",
    "plate tectonics and volcanic activity provide a sink for free o@xmath16 , and are the result of internal planet heating by radioactive uranium and of silicate fluidity , both of which are expected to be generic whenever the mass of the planet is sufficient and when liquid water is present . for small enough planet masses , volcanic activity disappears some time after planet formation , as do the associated oxygen sinks .",
    "@xcite showed that o@xmath71 is itself a tracer of o@xmath16 and , with a prominent spectral signature at 9.6  @xmath18 m in the infrared where the planet / star contrast is significantly stronger than in the optical , should be easier to detect than the visible wavelength lines .",
    "these considerations are motivating the development of infrared space interferometers ( section  [ sec : imaging ] ) for the study of lines such as h@xmath16o at 68  @xmath18 m , ch@xmath17 at 7.7  @xmath18 m , o@xmath71 at 9.6  @xmath18 m and co@xmath16 at 15  @xmath18 m ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "higher resolution studies might reveal the presence of ch@xmath17 , its presence on earth resulting from a balance between anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and its interaction with atmospheric oxygen ; its highly disequilibrium co - existence with o@xmath16 could be strong evidence for the existence of life ( @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility that o@xmath71 is not an unambiguous identification of earth - like biology but rather a result of abiotic processes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) was considered in detail by @xcite .",
    "they considered various production processes such as abiotic photodissociation of co@xmath16 and h@xmath16o followed by the preferential escape of hydrogen from the atmosphere .",
    "in addition , cometary bombardment could bring o@xmath16 and o@xmath71 sputtered from h@xmath16o by energetic particles ( cf .",
    "the ultraviolet spectral signature of o@xmath71 in the satellites of saturn , rhea and dione , @xcite ) according to the temperature , greenhouse blanketing , and presence of volcanic activity .",
    "they concluded that a simultaneous detection of significant amounts of h@xmath16o and o@xmath71 in the atmosphere of a planet in the habitable zone presently stands as a criterion for large - scale photosynthetic activity on the planet .",
    "whether these would correspond to a true signature of a biological process is less clear .",
    "an absence of o@xmath16 , on the contrary , would not necessarily imply the absence of life .",
    "habitability may be further confined within a narrow range of [ fe / h ] of the parent star ( @xcite ; see section  [ sec : host - properties ] ) .",
    "if the occurrence of gas giants decreases at lower metallicities , their shielding of inner planets in the habitable zone from frequent cometary impacts , as occurs in our solar system , would also be diminished ( @xcite ) . at higher metallicity , asteroid and cometary debris left over from planetary formation",
    "may be more plentiful , enhancing impact probabilities .",
    "@xcite has investigated whether the anomalously small motion of the sun with respect to the local standard of rest , both in terms of its pseudo - elliptical component within the galactic plane , and its vertical excursion with respect to the mid - plane , may be explicable in anthropic terms . such an orbit could provide effective shielding from high - energy ionising photons and cosmic rays from nearby supernovae , from the x - ray background by neutral hydrogen in the galactic plane , and from temporary increases in the perturbed oort comet impact rate . if chiral asymmetry is also a prerequisite for life ( e.g.  @xcite ) habitability may further depend on the polarisation environment of the star forming region .",
    "such complex considerations may imply that the fraction of habitable planets is small .",
    "the search for extra - terrestrial intelligence ( seti ) , nevertheless motivated by the belief that life is almost bound to emerge under conditions resembling those on the early earth ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) is not considered in this review .",
    "evaluation of the probability that intelligent civilizations exist elsewhere in our galaxy , for example through consideration of the drake equation ( e.g.  @xcite ) , or resolution of the ` fermi paradox ' ( if other advanced civilizations exist , where are they ? ) may lie far in the future .",
    "success or persistent failure will be of considerable significance .",
    "concerns such as ` who will speak for earth ' when or if contact is made ( @xcite ) , are far from today s scientific mainstream , but perhaps not as far as they were 10  years ago .",
    "precise radial velocity measurements have discovered 34 extrasolar giant planets within about 50  pc over the last 5  years . with many radial velocity monitoring programmes underway , and an occurrence rate of some 5% in systems measured to date , we may expect that some 100  such planets will be discovered over the next 5  years , some 1020 of which may be close - in systems for which transit measurements may be possible .",
    "a number of other experimental techniques capable of detecting extra - solar planets are under development .",
    "global space astrometric measurements at the 10  microarcsec level may furnish a list of 1020000 giant planets out to 100200  pc by the year 2020 , while accurate photometric monitoring from space should lead to the detection and characterisation of significantly lower mass planets .",
    "together , such data sets will provide a vast statistical description of planetary masses , orbits , and eccentricities , allowing important constraints to be placed on the complex processes believed to be involved in planetary formation . improved knowledge of individual systems ,",
    "in particular from transit measurements , combined with improved atmospheric modelling and theories of habitability , will narrow down the range of identified planets on which life may have developed .",
    "nearby , earth - mass planets should exist , and would be the natural targets for infrared space interferometers which , by 2020 , may succeed in imaging and providing evidence for life on them .",
    "we now know that other worlds  large ones at least  are common .",
    "developments have been so rapid over the last few years that many significant developments , and many new surprises , can be predicted with confidence .",

    "<S> the newly - discovered systems confirm some of the features predicted by standard theories of star and planet formation , but systems with massive planets having very small orbital radii and large eccentricities are common and were generally unexpected .    </S>",
    "<S> other techniques being used to search for planetary signatures include accurate measurement of positional ( astrometric ) displacements , gravitational microlensing , and pulsar timing , the latter resulting in the detection of the first planetary mass bodies beyond our solar system in 1992 . </S>",
    "<S> the transit of a planet across the face of the host star provides significant physical diagnostics , and the first such detection was announced in 1999 . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , direct imaging of extra - solar planets represents an enormous challenge . </S>",
