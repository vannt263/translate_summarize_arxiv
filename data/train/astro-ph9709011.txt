    "m81 , at a distance of 4  mpc , is the nearest galaxy with an active galactic nucleus , with the possibly exception of cen a. the nucleus is exceptionally compact : 700  au @xmath0 300  au at 22  ghz , with the size being proportional to @xmath1 ( bietenholz  1996 ; bartel  1995 ; bartel  1982 ; see also kellermann 1976 ) . here",
    "we present further results from new vla and vlbi observations of the nucleus of m81 .",
    "the nucleus of m81 was used as a reference source for the continuing program of vlbi monitoring of sn1993j ( see rupen   these proceedings p.  [ rupen ] ) .",
    "vla data were taken simultaneously with the vlbi runs .",
    "flux densities were derived from images , and the results are shown in figure  [ bietef1 ] .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the flux calibration ( 5% ) dominates internal uncertainties .",
    "the flux density of m81 varies by over a factor of 2 at 8.4  ghz ( see also van dyk & ho , these proceedings p.  [ vanho ] ) . at this frequency , the mean observed flux density was 120  mjy with a standard deviation of 22  mjy or 19% .",
    "the flux densities at 5 and 8.4  ghz seem well correlated , although the radio spectral index ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ) is not constant within our errors : @xmath2 varies by up to @xmath4 .",
    "in our vlbi observations , the nucleus of m81 is only slightly resolved and somewhat asymmetrical ( in agreement with bietenholz 1996 ) . in table",
    "[ bietet1 ] , we give the results of fitting simple geometrical models to fully calibrated _",
    "u - v _ data .",
    "we used the aips program omfit to simultaneously fit model parameters and determine the complex antenna gains . in the simplest case of fitting a single elliptical gaussian ,",
    "the size varies by 40% . the data , however , are not well described by such a model : in all cases , the fit is significantly improved if we fit , in addition to the central elliptical gaussian source , a weaker point source at relative position @xmath6 . though our resolution is inadequate to determine the detailed source structure , the data clearly demand structure more complicated than a single elliptical gaussian .",
    "note that our conservative estimates of the uncertainties take into account any contribution from the fit time - variable antenna gains ( a more complete description will be published elsewhere ) .    in summary , we find that there is structure on scales of @xmath7  mas in the nucleus of m81",
    ". it can be described as an elongated core , with a north - east south - west orientation , and a component of lower flux density to the north - east thereof .",
    "this latter component , in particular , appears to be variable on timescales of weeks ."
