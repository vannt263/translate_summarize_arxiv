    "the investigation of open quantum systems from various different perspectives has been subject of intense research in recent years motivated by fundamental questions , and also due to their crucial role in the realization of quantum information protocols in real world situations @xcite .",
    "one interesting approach to address open quantum systems is through the information flow among constituents of composite quantum systems , or in particular , to explore the exchange of information between the system of interest and its surrounding environment . from the point of view of memory effects",
    ", the dynamical quantum maps are usually divided in two groups , namely , markovian and non - markovian maps .",
    "memoryless processes are often recognized as markovian , where the information is expected to monotonically flow from the system to the environment . on the other hand ,",
    "it is rather natural to assume that the backflow of information from the environment to the system is connected to the presence of memory effects , because in these cases the future states of the system may depend on its past states as a result of the inverse exchange of information .",
    "quantum markovian maps are traditionally defined as the ones obtained from the solutions of lindblad type master equations , which can be described by quantum dynamical semigroups @xcite .",
    "thus , manifestation of memory effects in the form of recoherence and blackflow of information has been associated to the violation of the semigroup property . however , for such memory effects to emerge , failure to satisfy the semigroup property is not sufficient .",
    "the quantum map should also violate another property called divisibility @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an ever increasing interest in the non - markovian nature of quantum processes @xcite and quantifying their degree of non - markovianity using several distinct criteria @xcite .",
    "whereas some authors have directly adopted the property of divisibility as the defining feature of quantum markovian processes @xcite , others have employed different means to identify memory effects @xcite , which are not exactly equivalent but closely related to divisibility approach .",
    "in fact , unlike its classical counterpart , there is no universal definition of non - markovianity in the quantum domain , and different measures do not coincide in general .",
    "yet , it is reasonable to believe that conceptually different measures capture complementary aspects of the same phenomenon .",
    "one of the most widely studied and significant quantifiers of the degree of non - markovianity has been proposed by breuer , laine and piilo ( blp ) @xcite . rather than defining non - markovianity based on the violation of divisibility , the blp measure intends to determine the amount of non - markovianity of a quantum process by checking the trace distance between two arbitrary states of the open system during the dynamics , which in fact quantifies the probability of successfully distinguishing these two states . considering that the ability of distinguishing two objects is in a sense related to how much information we have about them",
    ", it is claimed that the monotonic reduction of distinguishability can be directly interpreted as a one - way flow of information from the system to the environment , which defines a markovian quantum process .",
    "in contrast , if there is a temporary increase of trace distance throughout the time evolution of the system , then the quantum map is said to be non - markovian due to the backflow of information from the environment to the system .",
    "another popular approach to quantify the degree of non - markovianity is based on a well known property of local completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps , that is , on their inability to increase entanglement between a system and an isolated ancilla @xcite .",
    "rivas , huelga and plenio ( rhp ) have introduced a witness for non - divisibility of quantum maps by making use of the monotonic behavior of entanglement measures under cptp maps @xcite .",
    "although this quantity does not provide a necessary and sufficient condition for divisibility , it can be adopted as a measure of non - markovianity on its own since it has been shown that it encapsulates the information exchange between the system and environment through the concept of accessible information @xcite . in this case , a non - markovian process is characterized by a temporary increase of entanglement between the system and the isolated ancilla , which is an indicator of the backflow of information from the environment to the system . in the same spirit , luo , fu , and song ( lfs ) have proposed a similar quantity that relies on the mutual information between a system and an arbitrary ancilla instead of entanglement @xcite . despite being easier to manage than entanglement - based measure mathematically , especially for high dimensional systems",
    ", this quantity does not yet have an interpretation directly related to the flow of information between the system and the environment .    in this work ,",
    "our aim is twofold .",
    "first , using the language of the decoherence program , where a system @xmath0 is coupled to a measurement apparatus @xmath1 , which in turn interacts with an environment @xmath2 @xcite , we introduce a simple scheme to demonstrate how quantum loss @xcite can be utilized to describe the backflow of information from the environment @xmath2 to the system @xmath0 .",
    "this approach is shown to be exactly equivalent to the lfs measure of non - markovianity and thus gives it an interpretation in terms of information exchange between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we reveal how the entanglement and the mutual information based measures of non - markovianity are conceptually related to each other through the connection between quantum loss and accessible information .",
    "second , we extend the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in several new directions .",
    "in particular , we investigate the role of both accessible information and quantum loss in quantifying non - markovian behavior , via conceptually different means of information flow , in two paradigmatic models .",
    "we find out that , unlike the blp measure , both lfs and rhp measures can capture the dynamical information in the non - unital aspect of the dynamics and thus can successfully identify non - markovian behavior in corresponding models .",
    "lastly , for a two - level system undergoing relaxation at zero temperature , we experimentally demonstrate the connection between quantum loss and quantum mutual information performing a quantum simulation with an all optical setup that allows full access to the environmental degrees of freedom @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we introduce the definitions of the considered non - markovianity measures , and discuss how they are related to the flow of information between the system and the environment .",
    "we also present a clear conceptual connection between the quantum loss and the accessible information in quantifying information exchange . in sec .",
    "iii , using the rhp , lfs and blp measures , we examine two examples of paradigmatic quantum channels theoretically , and present the experiment and its results .",
    "section iv includes the discussion and summary of our findings .",
    "let us first define the type of quantum processes that we consider .",
    "we assume that a dynamical quantum map is described by a time - local master equation of the lindblad form @xmath3 with the lindbladian super - operator @xmath4 @xcite given as @xmath5 + \\sum_{i}\\gamma_{i}\\left[a_i\\rho a_i^\\dagger-\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{a_i^\\dagger a_i,\\rho\\right\\}\\right],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath7 s are the decay rates , and @xmath8 s are the lindblad operators describing the type of noise affecting the system",
    ". provided @xmath8 s and @xmath7 s are time independent , and also all @xmath7 s are positive , eq . ( [ master ] ) leads to a dynamical semigroup of cptp maps @xmath9 $ ] with @xmath10 satisfying the semigroup property @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "such a quantum dynamics defines a conventional markovian process .",
    "however , it is possible that the hamiltonian @xmath6 , noise operators @xmath8 , and decay rates @xmath7 may have explicit time dependence . in this case ,",
    "( [ master ] ) leads to what is known as a time - dependent markovian process , if @xmath13 throughout the time evolution of the system .",
    "dynamical maps might be written in terms of a time - ordered exponential as @xmath14 $ ] , which takes the state at time @xmath15 to the state at time @xmath16 .",
    "such markovian maps have a fundamental property that they satisfy the condition of divisibility .",
    "in particular , a cptp map @xmath17 can be expressed as a composition of two other cptp maps as @xmath18 with @xmath19 $ ] , for all @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to stress that time - dependent decay rates @xmath20 may become temporarily negative during the dynamics of the system .",
    "in such a situation , there exists an intermediate dynamical map @xmath21 which is not cptp , and thus violating the composition law for divisibility given by eq .",
    "( [ div ] ) @xcite .",
    "let us remember that what we have introduced as a time - dependent markovian process above is centered on the property of divisibility .",
    "however , the criteria for non - markovian dynamics that we will discuss in the following sections are not exactly equivalent to non - divisibility of the dynamical maps , but rather rely on the idea of information backflow from the environment to the system from three conceptually different points of view .",
    "the blp measure of non - markovianity @xcite is constructed upon the trace distance between two arbitrary states @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the reduced system of interest , which is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "it has been discussed that the trace distance has a physical interpretation in terms of the relative distinguishability of two quantum states .",
    "suppose that alice prepares a quantum system in either @xmath26 or @xmath27 , with equal probabilities , and then sends it to bob whose goal is to perform a single measurement on the system to reveal its state . in this scenario ,",
    "it is possible to show that bob can successfully identify the state of the system with an optimal probability of @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "hence , the trace distance can in fact be thought as a quantifier of the distinguishability of two states , variation of which during the evolution can be interpreted as an information exchange between the system and the environment . in particular , a monotonic loss of distinguishability between @xmath22 and @xmath23 during the dynamics , i.e. @xmath29 , indicates that information flows from the system to the environment at all times and thus the process is markovian . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath30 means that there exists a backlow of information from the environment to the system , giving rise to a non - markovian process .",
    "based on this criterion , the blp measure is defined as @xmath31 where the maximum is taken over all possible pairs of initial states @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we should also note that the above equation can also be equivalently expressed as @xmath34,\\label{sblpm}\\ ] ] where time intervals @xmath35 correspond to the regions where @xmath30 , and maximization is done over all pairs of initial states . even though this optimization is a considerably hard task , it is possible to simplify the procedure in several ways by reducing the number of possible optimizing pairs .",
    "furthermore , considering the fact that cptp maps are contractions for the trace distance , one can show that the distinguishability between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is guaranteed to monotonically decrease for all divisible processes . thus , according to the blp measure , all divisible dynamical maps define markovian processes .",
    "nonetheless , the inverse statement is not necessarily true , that is , there exist non - divisible maps for which the trace distance does not show any temporary revival at all .",
    "in fact , the trace distance is actually a witness for non - divisibility .",
    "in addition , it has been recently shown that the trace distance is not able to capture the dynamical information in the non - unital aspect of quantum dynamics .",
    "consequently , it fails to identify the non - markovianity originated from the non - unital part of the transformation @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we introduce a new method of quantifying non - markovianity through the flow of information between the system and the environment , using a conceptually different approach than the blp measure .",
    "our discussion relies on the decoherence program , where a quantum system @xmath0 is coupled to a measurement apparatus @xmath1 , which in turn directly interacts with an environment @xmath2 .",
    "let us first consider a quantum system @xmath0 that is initially correlated with the apparatus @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the bipartite system @xmath36 starts as a pure state , and the environment only affects the state of the apparatus @xmath1 . as a result of the interaction ,",
    "there emerges an amount of correlation among the individual parts of the closed tripartite system @xmath37 , and thus the environment @xmath2 acquires information about the system @xmath0 by means of the interaction with the apparatus @xmath1 .",
    "this setting is graphically sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the system @xmath0 evolves trivially while the apparatus @xmath1 is in a direct unitary interaction with the environment @xmath2 .",
    "the final state of the composite tripartite system @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where tilde denotes the state of the subsystems after the time evolution .",
    "the resulting state of each part of the composite system can be obtained by tracing over the remaining parts .",
    "particularly , if we discard the environment @xmath2 , we obtain the bipartite state of the system @xmath0 and the apparatus @xmath1 as @xmath39 which corresponds to applying a general cptp map to the apparatus @xmath1 while leaving the state of the system @xmath0 untouched .    , and an entangled pure state @xmath36 .",
    "as the system @xmath0 evolves free of any direct interaction , the apparatus is interacting with the environment @xmath2.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    let us now introduce some preliminary concepts that will be relevant to our treatment of the information exchange between the system and the environment . for a bipartite system @xmath40 , while the conditional quantum entropy is defined as @xmath41 the quantum mutual information is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the von - neumann entropy of the considered systems , characterizing the uncertainty about them .",
    "provided that we have a quantum system @xmath40 in a pure state , we obtain @xmath44 and , as a result , @xmath45 .",
    "moving to tripartite system @xmath46 , we can define the conditional quantum entropy of @xmath47 and @xmath48 conditionally on z as @xmath49 whereas the quantum ternary mutual information reads @xmath50 it is important to note that @xmath51 , and the quantum ternary mutual information @xmath52 vanishes for a pure tripartite state , i.e. , @xmath53 .    in the following , we adopt the terminology introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . making use of the analogy with the classical information theory",
    ", we can make an entropy diagram for the composite system of @xmath37 to show how each part of the tripartite system share and exchange information among its subsystems .",
    "for this purpose , we define three quantities that will be very useful to describe the information dynamics of the tripartite system , namely , the quantum mutual information @xmath54 , the quantum loss @xmath55 , and the quantum noise @xmath56 : @xmath57 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we display the entropy diagram for @xmath37 using the above quantities . the quantum mutual information @xmath54 quantifies the amount of residual mutual entropy between the system @xmath0 and the apparatus @xmath1 after the decoherence occurs . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum loss @xmath55 represents the amount of information that is getting lost in the environment @xmath2 .",
    "actually , among these three quantities , only @xmath54 and @xmath55 are relevant to us , since information exchange between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 is characterized by the balance between them .",
    "it is very important to emphasize that the equality @xmath58 holds at all times during the dynamics .",
    "that is , twice the initial entropy of the system @xmath0 will be redistributed to the apparatus @xmath1 and the environment @xmath2 as decoherence takes place . in other words , the total amount of information inside the closed thick red line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] will remain invariant .",
    "indeed , as the composite tripartite system @xmath37 evolves in time , the environment @xmath2 will learn about the system @xmath0 , and the quantum mutual information @xmath59 will start to decrease as a result of its monotonicity under local cptp maps .",
    "this will be directly reflected as an increase in the quantum loss @xmath55 , which is naturally zero initially , as can be observed from eq .",
    "( [ il ] ) .",
    "however , it is also possible that @xmath54 might temporarily revive during dynamics , which will give rise to a temporary decrease in @xmath55 .    , the apparatus @xmath1 , and the environment @xmath2 , before and after the interaction .",
    "the amount of information will stay the same inside the area enclosed by thick red curves , i.e. , @xmath60 , where @xmath54 is the mutual information and @xmath55 is the quantum loss.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    regarding non - markovianity as a phenomenon that is intrinsically related to the backflow of information from the environment @xmath2 to the system @xmath0 , it is reasonable to expect the quantum loss @xmath55 to monotonically increase for markovian dynamics , since it is an entropic measure of information that the environment @xmath2 acquires about the system @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , one can define non - markovian processes as the ones for which there is a temporary loss of @xmath55 as the system evolves in time , i.e. @xmath61 , since this is an indication that the information flows back to the system @xmath0 from the environment @xmath2 .",
    "we should clarify that when we say information flow from the system @xmath0 to the environment @xmath2 or vice versa , we do not actually mean that total information content of the system changes , since it is constant at all times due to the fact that the system @xmath0 does not directly interact with the environment @xmath2 .",
    "rather , we mean that information is being redistributed in the tripartite composite system @xmath37 in such a way that the amount of information that the system @xmath0 shares with the environment @xmath2 increases or decreases , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    at first sight",
    ", one might think that evaluation of the quantum loss @xmath55 requires the knowledge of the state of the environment @xmath2 , which typically consists of infinite number of degrees of freedom , and is virtually impossible to access in real world situations .",
    "however , we actually do not need to directly access the environment to be able to calculate @xmath55 .",
    "it can be explicitly written without dependence on the environment @xmath2 , @xmath62    an interesting point is that the quantum loss @xmath55 can also be rewritten as a difference of the initial and final mutual information shared by the system @xmath0 and the apparatus @xmath1 , that is , @xmath63 as can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ il ] ) , since the initial mutual information @xmath59 is twice the initial entropy of the system @xmath0 .",
    "taking the time derivative of this simple equation , we find that @xmath64 recalling that the lfs measure @xcite of non - markovianity is based on the rate of change of the quantum mutual information shared by the system @xmath0 and the apparatus @xmath1 , we immediately realize that in fact the quantum loss approach to non - markovianity is exactly equivalent to the formulation of the lfs measure .",
    "in particular , the lfs measure captures the non - markovian behavior through a temporary increase of the mutual information of the bipartite system @xmath36 .",
    "mathematically , the lfs measure can be written as @xmath65 where the maximization is evaluated over all possible pure initial states of the bipartite system @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the quantum loss gives an interpretation to the lfs measure in terms of information exchange between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 , since any temporary loss of @xmath55 will be observed as a temporary revival of @xmath54 by the same amount . note that it directly follows from the composition law of divisibility given in eq .",
    "( [ div ] ) that the lfs measure vanishes for all divisible quantum processes due to the monotonicity of the mutual information under cptp maps .",
    "we should still keep in mind that the inverse statement is not always true .",
    "some non - divisible maps do not increase the mutual information , or equivalently , decrease the quantum loss at all .     and the inaccessible information @xmath66 in the entropy diagram of the tripartite system @xmath37 after the interaction of the apparatus @xmath1 with the environment @xmath2.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]      next , we introduce another quantity known as the accessible information @xcite , which quantifies the maximum amount of classical information that can be extracted about the system @xmath0 by locally observing the environment @xmath2 , @xmath67 , \\label{ai}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 defines a complete positive operator valued measure ( povm ) acting on the state of the environment @xmath2 , and @xmath69 is the remaining state of subsystem @xmath0 after obtaining the outcome @xmath70 with the probability @xmath71 . considering the fact that the quantum loss @xmath55 is nothing but the quantum mutual information between the system @xmath0 and the final state of the environment after decoherence , @xmath72 , it is possible to express it as @xmath73 where @xmath66 ( known as the quantum discord in literature as a genuine measure of non - classicality @xcite ) quantifies the part of the quantum mutual information @xmath55 that the environment @xmath72 can not access about the system @xmath0 locally during the decoherence process .",
    "in other words , despite the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath72 have the information @xmath55 in common , we can only access a fraction of it , namely @xmath74 , by just observing the state of the environment @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we display the accessible and and inaccessible information in the entropy diagram of @xmath37 after the interaction starts to take place .    returning to the discussion of non - markovianity , one might argue that it is also quite reasonable to define non - markovianity in terms of information flow using the accessible information instead of the quantum loss .",
    "the reason is that the accessible information measures the fraction of information that the environment @xmath2 can actually access about the system @xmath0 , rather than the total amount of information they share as quantified by the quantum loss .",
    "similarly to the case of @xmath54 , we do not need any information about the state of the environment @xmath0 to be able to evaluate the accessible information .",
    "remembering that the environment @xmath2 is initially in a pure state , that is , we consider a zero temperature reservoir , and also that the tripartite state @xmath37 stays pure at all times , the koashi - winter relation implies that @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the entanglement of formation shared by the system @xmath0 and the apparatus @xmath1 , which is a resource - based measure quantifying the cost of generating a given state by means of maximally entangled resources @xcite .",

    "( [ div ] ) implies that the rhp measure vanishes for all divisible quantum processes , just as in the case of the lfs measure , and again the inverse statement might not be always true since it is possible for some non - divisible maps not to increase entanglement .",

    "therefore , the interferometer produces a controlled decrease of the polarization component representing the excited state . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , we show what happens when the control parameter is @xmath120 and the input state is @xmath121 .",
    "the incoming photon splits in two polarization components . the vertical one is represented by the blue ball and is transmitted .",
    "the horizontal one is represented by the red ball and is deviated to another propagation mode .",
    "half wave plates @xmath122 and @xmath123 are adjusted to rotate polarizations @xmath124 to @xmath6 and vice - versa .",
    "this causes the two beams to recombine in the second beam displacer , so that the state at the output is the same as the state at the input .        in fig .",
    "[ fig4]c we show the case where @xmath89 . in this case",
    ", the half wave plate @xmath123 does not rotate the polarization from @xmath124 to @xmath6 completely .",
    "there is a residual vertical component so that the recombination of the beams in the output of the interferometer does not recover the same state as the input .",
    "the output state has the horizontal component reduced , and this component leaks out to the upper propagation mode .",
    "therefore , the input mode is coupled to two output modes",
    ". the state of this pair of modes , or path degree of freedom , represents the environment @xmath2 .",
    "this evolution is isomorphic to an increase in the ground state component of the atom in our analogy , or an increase in the probability of the atom to emit a photon to the environmental modes .",
    "after propagation through the first interferometer corresponding to the application of the map , there is a second interferometer , which is composed by beam displacers @xmath125 and @xmath126 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a . together with the half and quarter wave plates @xmath127 and @xmath128 , it is used to reconstruct the state of the three qubits .",
    "the total system is given by the idler polarization , the apparatus represented by the signal photon polarization , and the environment represented by the path degree of freedom of the signal photon . finally , for the quantum state tomography",
    ", 64 combinations of wave plate angles are used , and signal and idler photons are detected in coincidence .",
    "we performed the experiment and reconstructed the final three - qubit state for different values of @xmath116 . from this state , we computed the correlations displayed in fig .",
    "we can see the theoretical plot of the quantum loss @xmath55 ( blue line ) and the quantum mutual information @xmath54 ( dashed red line ) .",
    "the curves were obtained by evolving the experimentally reconstructed initial state , which is not perfectly pure , and calculating the quantities from the evolved states .",
    "the inset displays the decay rate @xmath129 ( orange line ) as a function of scaled time @xmath130 , that is being experimentally controlled by @xmath131 the rotation angle of the half wave plate @xmath123 .",
    "the experimental points for @xmath55 and @xmath54 are the black dots and purple triangles , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a we observe the monotonicity of information flow in the markovian regime with @xmath132 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b the non - monotonous behavior in the non - markovian regime with @xmath133 is shown .",
    "there is a good agreement between theory and experiment .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show essentially the same results as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but instead of considering an ideal pure initial state , we obtain the theoretical points from the evolution of the experimentally reconstructed initial state .",
    "we notice that taking into account this aspect leads to an improved agreement between theory and experiment . from these results",
    "we conclude that the interpretation in terms of exchange of information between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is valid . in the case of the amplitude damping , from figs.[fig5 ] and",
    "[ fig6 ] we observe that accessible information and quantum loss are essentially equivalent . in the next section",
    ", we will theoretically demonstrate that this is no longer true for the generalized amplitude damping channel .      in the second example we consider the generalized amplitude channel which describes the relaxation of a quantum system when the surrounding environment is at finite temperature initially , i.e. , when the environment starts from a mixed state .",
    "this phenomenological model is particularly interesting for us since it has been recently proved that the blp measure , based on the trace distance , is not able to capture the information about the dynamics of the system coming from the non - unital parts of quantum maps @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to compare different approaches to information exchange , our aim here is to check the behavior of the quantum loss @xmath55 and the accessible information @xmath74 under this channel , where non - divisibility actually is originated from the non - unital part of the dynamical map . in particular ,",
    "the set of kraus operators describing the dynamics of the apparatus @xmath1 is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 at all times @xmath16 with @xmath136 $ ] and @xmath137 $ ] , and the quantum map @xmath138 represented by the above set of operators is unital , that is @xmath139 , if and only if @xmath140 or @xmath141 .",
    "similarly to what was done in @xcite , to construct a quantum process , we choose the parameters as @xmath142 and @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is a real number .    before comparing the different approaches to monitor the information exchange between @xmath0 and @xmath2 ,",
    "let us first introduce another quantity which has been introduced in @xcite , based on the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the maximally entangled state of the system @xmath0 and the apparatus @xmath1 in the considered dimension . in fact , the condition @xmath147 is a necessary and sufficient criterion for non - divisibility of dynamical quantum maps .",
    "moreover , one can also define a measure of non - divisibility using @xmath148 by summing it over time during the time evolution of the open system .",
    "therefore , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ gdiv ] ) , we can investigate relation of information exchange , quantified through the quantum loss @xmath55 and the accessible information @xmath74 , to the regions of non - divisibility where the intermediate maps @xmath149 are not cptp . for the generalized amplitude damping channel , it turns out that @xcite @xmath150,\\ ] ] where @xmath151 .    while we show the graphs of the quantum loss @xmath55 ( solid blue line ) and the quantum mutual information @xmath54 ( dashed red line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a , we display the accessible information @xmath74 ( solid blue line ) and the entanglement of formation @xmath86 ( dashed red line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b . in all the plots",
    ", the initial state is taken as a maximally entangled one , and we set @xmath152 .",
    "the regions of non - divisibility are displayed by the intervals where @xmath148 is positive in fig .",
    "we note that , as expected due to eq .",
    "( [ dli ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ej ] ) , @xmath55 and @xmath54 , and @xmath74 and @xmath86 behave in an exact opposite manner .",
    "it is remarkable that , unlike the trace distance , both approaches based on information flow through entropic quantities reveal an exchange of information between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 .",
    "however , comparing the regions with @xmath147 to the intervals where @xmath55 and @xmath74 temporarily decrease , we see that they do always not coincide , which is in contrast to the zero temperature relaxation model in the previous section .",
    "this model demonstrates an explicit example of how the occurrence of non - divisibility throughout the dynamics of the open system might not always imply flow of information from the environment @xmath2 back to the system @xmath0 , even when the information exchange is measured via the quantum loss @xmath55 and the accessible information @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , another interesting observation is that although the quantum loss @xmath55 monotonically increases until @xmath153 in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a , the accessible information @xmath74 decreases temporarily starting from @xmath154 in fig .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that , despite their conceptual similarities , @xmath55 and @xmath74 do not have to agree on the backflow of information from the environment @xmath2 to the system @xmath0 , and can grow or decay independent of each other .",
    "nonetheless , we note for the considered model that the accessible information @xmath74 diminishes for some time in all intervals where @xmath148 becomes positive .",
    "we have presented a detailed investigation of the relation between the non - markovianity in quantum mechanics and the flow of information between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 .",
    "our treatment is based on the approach of assisted knowledge where we consider a principal system @xmath0 that is initially correlated with its measurement apparatus @xmath1 .",
    "although there is no direct interaction between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 , there still exists an exchange of information among the constituents of the tripartite system @xmath37 , due to the fact that the apparatus @xmath1 interacts with the environment @xmath2 .",
    "centered on this scenario , we have introduced a new way of understanding the information exchange between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 through the quantum loss @xmath55 , which quantifies the amount of residual information that the environment @xmath2 and the system @xmath0 have in common after the interaction .",
    "we have also shown how measuring the information flow and thus non - markovianity via quantum loss is in fact equivalent to utilizing the lfs measure of non - markovianity .",
    "this equivalence gives a straightforward information theoretic interpretation to the lfs measure .",
    "moreover , recognizing that using the entanglement - based rhp measure is equivalent to the accessible information approach , we have provided an alternative way of quantifying the exchange of information between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 .",
    "more important , we have also revealed a clear connection between two apparently unrelated measures of non - markovianity , namely the lfs and the rhp measures , by making use of the link between the quantum loss @xmath55 and the accessible information @xmath74 . in particular , the only conceptual difference between these two quantities lies on the local accessibility of the information shared between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 , when local observations are performed on the environment @xmath2 .",
    "we have studied the information exchange in terms of the quantum loss @xmath55 and the accessible information @xmath74 in two paradigmatic models , namely for the zero and finite temperature relaxation processes .",
    "for the zero temperature case , we have demonstrated that both the quantum loss @xmath55 and the accessible information @xmath74 are able to capture the flow of information in a similar way .",
    "moreover , we have provided an experimental simulation of this process using an all optical setup that allows full access to the environment .",
    "our experimental results are shown to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "for the finite temperature relaxation model , we have explored the similarities and the differences of measuring information flow in terms of the trace distance , the quantum loss @xmath55 and the accessible information @xmath74 .",
    "specifically , we have shown that , while the trace distance fails to capture the inverse flow of information originated from the non - unital part of the dynamical quantum map , both the quantum loss @xmath55 and the accessible information @xmath74 can successfully identify the exchange of information between the system @xmath0 and the environment @xmath2 in this case . on the other hand , we have also found that , despite their conceptual similarities , it is possible for the quantum loss ( the lfs measure ) and the accessible information ( the rhp measure ) to disagree on the flow of information in certain time intervals during the time evolution .",
