    "sometimes the individual modes are not fully kinematically distinct - there are overlap regions where more than one mode is active@xcite .",
    "these must be carefully dealt with .",
    "it will turn out that the regge physics lives in these overlap regions and involves a complicated interplay of regions and overlaps . the most consistent and efficient way to describe it uses @xmath0 including glauber modes , as will be described below .",
    "the simplified model is that of a scalar field with a trilinear interaction , which can be considered a scalar model for qcd . @xmath1 the kinematic region where regge behavior emerges is @xmath2 fixed .",
    "in such theory the leading regge behavior appears from summing an infinite set of ladder graphs , shown in figure [ ladder ] along with crossed ladder diagrams .",
    "the original calculation is due to polkinghorne@xcite .",
    "it is also very useful to know that we can reconstruct the regge behavior of the ladder sum from consideration of the s - channel discontinuities in the diagrams , where the relevant discontinuities are those where the cut lines are the rungs of the ladder , as in figure [ cut ] . in the cut analysis",
    ", it is required that all the ladder rungs correspond to on - shell modes , so this fact needs to be accommodated in the mode expansion .",

    "the way we will resolve a paradox that exists in the usual method of regions treatment of the box . in @xcite smirnov demonstrates how the box diagram can be reconstructed by the use of collinear modes for the vertical legs of the ladder , although an extra `` analytic regularization '' in which the propagators are modified is required .",
    "indeed , we will also find this result with our regularization .",
    "however , when the legs are collinear modes , at least one of the horizontal rungs of the box must be a hard mode which is far off - shell .",
    "( we will review the terminology and kinematics in more detail below . ) by unitarity , the off - shell mode should not be able to produce the imaginary part of the box diagram .",
    "however , we will show that the imaginary part arises from an overlap region which the collinear mode shares with glauber exchange . by removing the overlap ,",
    "the box can be reformulated in a version of scet including the glauber mode , , in which case the horizontal rung is in fact an on - shell ( collinear ) mode .",
    "the need to include glauber modes in scet has been shown by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , they have been shown to be important in the context of jets in a medium@xcite , and the relevance of these modes for regge physics was first shown in @xcite .",

    "although the ladder diagrams can not be calculated completely , the leading high energy behavior emerges from a corner of the feynman parameter integration and this corner can be analyzed and summed .",

    "the crossed box diagram is obtained by the substitution @xmath33 , and since @xmath34 we have @xmath35 .",

    ", we see that the result emerges entirely from the s - channel cut with both horizontal rungs being on - shell .",
    "the rest of the ladder sum is done in the same way .",
    "the important region in the integration is the corner where all the feynman parameters associated with the horizontal rungs becomes small . in this corner",
    "the correct @xmath38 behavior arises and the sum yields the regge form with amplitude and exponent being given by @xmath39    in real qcd , the situation is somewhat more complicated , but follows the same kinematic rules . within perturbative qcd ,",
    "this has been demonstrated by balitsky , fadin , kuraev and lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite and in related work@xcite .",
    "we consider the binary scattering of particles with momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while the outgoing particles carry momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 . the momentum transfer is defined as @xmath40 .",
    "we work in the center - of - mass frame and use light - cone coordinates requiring the introduction of two independent null vectors which read @xmath41 hence , four momenta are decomposed as follows @xmath42 for later convenience , we note the following identity @xmath43    regge physics is concerned with the kinematical limit @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the small parameter required for employing the method of regions ( scet ) then reads @xmath47 all external particles are treated as massless and on - shell , in particular @xmath48 .",
    "note that the scattering of two high energy on - shell particles , one in the @xmath49 direction and the other in the @xmath50 always involves an exchange in the so - called glauber region .",
    "this can be readily seen from the on - shell conditions @xmath51 because @xmath52 , this forces @xmath53 to scale as @xmath54 in the @xmath55 directions .",
    "the glauber region is characterized by having momentum dominantly in the transverse direction .",
    "the overall momentum transfer of regge exchange is glauber - like .",
    "in addition , one can include modes in the mode expansion which correspond to glauber kinematics .",
    "such modes are always off - shell , thus in the effective theory language they can be treated as an effective potential .",
    "there is an array of possibilities in the choice of infrared regulators for our calculation . among them",
    "is the analytic regulator used in @xcite , off - shellness of external momenta @xmath56 , or internal masses @xmath57 .",
    "if one uses off - shellness as a regulator with vanishing internal masses within the loop , one finds that the modes in the effective theory or method of regions are not regularized in four dimensions .",
    "hence off - shellness by itself fails to regulate the infrared behavior of the theory and one needs to add dimensional regulator in order to regulate the infrared divergences .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we regulate the infrared through the use of an internal mass for each internal line in any graph , keeping the external four - vectors on - shell with zero invariant mass .",
    "this fully controls the infrared region . for the leading high energy behavior",
    "the answer is the same if one uses massive external four - vectors with the same @xmath58 as in the original polkinghorne calculation .",
    "in this section we calculate the one - loop @xmath59 contribution to regge physics of the binary scattering explained above .",
    "we start off by computing the appropriate graphs in the full theory and then repeat the calculation using the method of regions to isolate the modes responsible for regge behavior . the graphs at the one - loop level which concern regge physics are the ones with box - like topology shown in figure [ box - topology ] .",

    "it was found that the box integral is recovered from two collinear graphs , similarly to our finding in this section with our regularization .",
    "note , that with their regulator the overlap contribution vanishes and does not play role .",

    "we directly employ cutkosky rule to compute the imaginary part of the direct - box graph .",

    "the integral over @xmath80 is readily done to absorb the second delta function and forces @xmath81 .",
    "this is very interesting because this means that @xmath82 which shows that the mode responsible for generating the leading regge behavior ought to have longitudinal components of equal scaling ; a condition clearly violated by collinear modes .",
    "we continue the calculation by performing the @xmath83 integral where a quadratic form appears in the argument of the delta function with the following roots @xmath84 the @xmath85 refers to large / small root respectively .",
    "clearly , the transverse integral has to be constrained since @xmath86 for @xmath87 to be real .",
    "the large root yields a result proportional to @xmath23 , and hence is power - suppressed . on the other hand ,",
    "the small root can be taylor - expanded @xmath88 the first term in the expansion yields the leading result in the regge limit , and hence @xmath89 .",
    "this is the second piece of information we need to pin - down the regge mode ; it has an excess in the transverse direction identical to the momentum transfer .",
    "we conclude that glauber scaling @xmath90 is genuinely resposible for regge behavior .",
    "finally , the result agrees with the full calculation @xmath91 + _ the box diagram in _ +   + in soft collinear effective theory with glauber modes an additional graph appears where the loop momentum is that of glauber scaling @xmath92 . with details provided in appendix",
    "a , the box integral in this momentum region is equal to @xmath93 when adding the glauber as an independent mode , overlaps with collinear modes must be taken into account , we calculate these in appendix a. the result is @xmath94 our calculation indicates that the imaginary part of the full theory is coming precisely from the glauber region ( at the one - loop order ) .",
    "in other words the matching in after all zero - bin ( overlap ) subtractions gives the same result as just the glauber mode @xmath95 as is well - known from factorization proofs of the drell - yan process , the glauber region is not pinched for the box topology @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , no surprise that we get the same answer in @xmath75 as in @xmath0 . when one uses the modes of scet , the collinear integrals each contain at least one of the intermediate propagators off - shell , thus the imaginary part ought to come from a subregion inside them .",
    "our calculation above precisely shows that the correct momentum region for the full box integral in the regge kinematics ( when direct and crossed box are added ) is the _",
    "what we mean by this is that the qcd box integral with crossed box added at one loop can be reproduced by a single glauber mode , that does not violate unitarity . as one adds the collinear graphs and",
    "glauber one together , the interpretation can be made that the true collinear mode obtained from naive collinear mode after zero - bin subtraction becomes purely real ( as it should be due to unitarity ) and cancels out between box and crossed box .",

    "we use the delta function to integrate over all plus components in addition to @xmath147 , and the remaining non - trivial integrals read @xmath148 where @xmath149 is a function of transverse momenta , but in the leading logarithmic approximation the answer does not depend on it .",
    "finally , we get keeping only leading in the regge limit term : @xmath150 this matches the qcd result .",
    "from our explicit calculations at one and two loop orders it is easy to guess the answer for higher orders .",
    "we first guess the answer and then prove it further below .",
    "we expect that the true momentum region for the regge kinematics at @xmath71 loop order is @xmath71 leading graphs which are subset of graphs with on - shell intermediate states .",
    "these are the graphs with a number of @xmath151collinear gluons in the loops , a single glauber gluon , and after it a number of @xmath152collinear momentum in the loops @xmath153 each of this amplitudes includes by our definition both the direct box and the crossed box .",
    "each of these amplitudes reproduces the leading regge behavior as @xmath101 and also any overlap of any subset of these amplitudes reproduces the regge behavior .",
    "thus once one combines all the modes , the answer is identical to only including a single mode which is the overlap of all @xmath71 momentum regions .    in order to prove the above statements we use the strong ordering derivation to show that arbitrary graph in the method of regions gives an identical result as single loop integral in qcd .",
    "consider for example @xmath154 graph .",
    "the loop momenta @xmath155 where @xmath156 scale as @xmath157 .",
    "thus the plus momentum satisfies @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "clearly the strong ordering region is a subregion of this region , since for the strong ordered region we have components are negative and all the @xmath160 components are positive .",
    "this is imposed by the theta functions in the expression for the qcd cut graph . ]",
    "@xmath161 thus repeating the usual strong ordering region derivation we would presumably get the same answer as in the full theory if we started to work on the graph @xmath154 .",
    "similarly we can show that every other relevant graph is identical to one another , since they all contain the strong ordering region as their sub - region .",
    "an analogous statement holds for any of the loop integrals involving glauber gluons .",
    "these subset of graphs are the only ones out of entire set that allow on - shell intermediate states .",
    "our observation that the multi - overlap of these regions plays an important role has a simple interpretation . at @xmath162loop order the single isolated momentum region that gives",
    "the leading regge behavior is the multi - overlap of all on - shell modes @xmath163 .",
    "it is easy to verify by a straightforward calculation similar to what we did at three - loop order @xmath164 which reproduces the qcd regge limit . in this section",
    "we showed that all leading modes have strong ordering momentum region as their sub - region , thus including only the multiple overlap of all these modes is sufficient and no surprise leads to the correct answer .",
    "we have shown how one obtains regge physics using the mode expansion of scet . in the effective field theory ,",
    "the key contributions come from overlap regions which must be carefully treated .",
    "the simplest and most consistent approach includes the glauber modes of the effective field theory .    in the scalar theory that we discuss , the one loop contribution that starts the regge ladder sum comes from the imaginary part of the box diagram .",
    "the box diagram can be reproduced in an effective theory which includes only the hard and collinear modes .",
    "however this comes at the cost of seemingly violating the unitarity property of field theory in that the imaginary part of the amplitude arises from a hard intermediate state which the effective theory says is far off - shell .",
    "this result tell us that in fact the contribution comes from an overlap region with an on - shell mode . by including the exchange of glauber modes in the description",
    ", we can again recover the full box diagram via the mode expansion . in this case , after accounting for the overlap regions , the imaginary part of the amplitude is properly obtained from t - channel glauber exchange with s - channel on - shell collinear modes .    at higher order",
    "the deconstruction of the various overlap regions continues , with a final result that is simple to state .",
    "collinear modes provide many of the legs in the ladder sum , and all of the s - channel on - shell states .",
    "however , at any given loop order , a glauber mode is responsible for the connection between the collinear @xmath49 and @xmath50 modes .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated this at two loops , and provided an argument that this continues for all higher loops .",
    "as we were writing up our project , a related paper by fleming showed how one can obtain the well - known bfkl equation from rapidity rge in the effective theory@xcite . in fleming s calculation the forward scattering matrix element which falls in the glauber region",
    "is calculated to one - loop order and rapidity divergent couterterm is determined . as a result",
    "the bfkl equation and the regge behavior emerge from scet with glauber gluons . in our paper",
    "we also showed how regge behavior emerges from scet with glauber gluons , however we looked at it from a fixed order point of view by summing a series of graphs order - by order in the perturbation theory . in doing",
    "so we paid a special attention to the momentum region where the regge behavior arises from and we concluded that the glauber mode plays an important role to connect the @xmath151collinear sector with @xmath152 collinear sector with keeping intermediate propagators on - shell .",
    "the combined regge mode we find is the mutual overlap of all such graphs at a given order and reproduces the regge behavior .",
    "it should be noted that fleming uses real qcd and works in the framework of @xmath165 with glaubers . in our work",
    "we only considered the modes of @xmath166 with glauber gluons added and used a toy scalar field theory .    neither this work nor @xcite ( nor the early work of @xcite ) is the final word on this subject .",
    "it is a common practice to apply scet to resum sudakov logarithms in high energy processes to very high orders in the logarithmic accuracy .",
    "the effective theory language is particularly efficient operationally .",
    "we hope that the results of this paper will guide the construction of a consistent eft formulation of qcd that explains regge behavior and allows the resummation of regge logs similarly to existing techniques for sudakov resummation .",
    "we need a technology that starts from the effective lagrangian which allows a theorist to provide complete descriptions of processes including the usual scet calculations but in addition including regge contributions when appropriate .",
    "the good news is that we can now see that regge physics can be compatible with the effective field theory .",
    "however , we do not yet have the complete technology to include such effects in realistic calculation in a transparent and consistent fashion . from this work it follows that @xmath75 is an obvious candidate for such an effective field theory .",
