    "the miniboone neutrino experiment searches for @xmath2 and @xmath3 oscillations @xcite , as motivated by the anomalous excess of @xmath4 observed by lsnd in the @xmath5 beam @xcite .",

    ", miniboone reported a low energy excess in both runs @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the two are interrelated . in other words , it is important to understand this excess in a complete neutrino oscillation analysis . for the excess , different explanations have been hypothesized , including anomalous photon-@xmath0 boson - vector meson couplings @xcite , lorentz violation @xcite , sterile neutrinos @xcite , and new gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "however , a clear understanding of the excess has not been achieved so far .",
    "it was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite that neutral current ( nc)-induced photon and @xmath7 production are potential backgrounds in the experiment , because the final photons can be misidentified as electrons in the detector .",
    "measurement of neutrino - induced pion production has been carried out in miniboone and used in their background analysis @xcite , but nc photon production has not been directly measured . instead , nc",
    "photon production has been estimated by assuming a relationship between @xmath1 radiative decay and pion decay in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite proposed that anomalous photon-@xmath0-meson couplings might increase nc photon production significantly to explain the excess .",
    "a rigorous calculation of nc photon production , taking into account nuclear effects , has not been carried out to date but is what we aim to accomplish in this study .",
    "there are different channels in photon production , including incoherent and coherent production , but such distinction is not obvious in miniboone s background analysis .",
    "the nucleon fermi motion , pauli blocking , and broadening of the @xmath1 inside nucleus [ due to the opening of other decay channels ( e.g. @xmath8 ) ] have important effects on the production , but unfortunately are missing in the previous calculations @xcite .",
    "this report summarizes our computation of nc photon event numbers in miniboone .",
    "the calculation is based on a series of works dedicated to low energy ( neutrino energy below @xmath9 gev ) neutrino - induced photon and pion production @xcite in which the neutrino - nucleon interaction kernel as derived from a chiral effective field theory ( eft ) for nuclei is calibrated to available pion data",
    ". also , the nuclear effects and the approximation schemes in the study of incoherent and coherent production are benchmarked by the corresponding electron - nucleus scattering and pion photoproduction data .",
    "two contact terms in the eft , named as @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms here , are the low energy manifestation of the proposed anomalous photon-@xmath0-meson interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was realized @xcite that other sources also lead to these low energy interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have calibrated the @xmath10 and @xmath11 values to the coherent pion photoproduction data , and found @xmath10 is correlated with the other two parameters @xmath12 that control the @xmath1 binding potential and spin - orbit coupling in the nucleus .",
    "the uncertainty of these parameters , which eventually leads to uncertainty in the photon event calculation , will be discussed in detail later .    as emphasized in the previous works @xcite , the eft approach is only valid for low energy neutrinos .",
    "it turns out that the so - called low energy excess , if due to nc photon production , gets important contribution from higher energy neutrinos because the reconstructed neutrino energy @xmath13 in miniboone , based on quasielastic scattering kinematics , can underestimate the true energy substantially in this channel .",
    "this study essentially amounts to the high energy extrapolation of previous works @xcite . to benchmark the extrapolation of the neutrino - nucleon interaction kernel",
    ", the neutrino - induced pion production is calculated and compared to higher energy neutrino data ( @xmath14 gev ) .",
    "a reasonable form factor is associated with @xmath10 and @xmath11 couplings to regularize their high energy behavior as inspired by the anomalous photon-@xmath0-meson interactions @xcite .",
    "the nuclear effects are included as before .",
    "the final results , based on the detector information and updated detection efficiencies from refs .",
    "@xcite , indicate that in both neutrino and antineutrino runs , for @xmath13 below @xmath15 gev , the experimental estimate is close to our computation ; at higher @xmath13 , it is close to our lower bound but significantly smaller than our upper bound , although still compatible within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "we also compare our event numbers vs. @xmath16 with the experimental estimate : our results agree with the experimental estimates , except in the lowest @xmath16 bin ( @xmath17 $ ] gev ) in both runs where ours are larger than their estimates yet the differences are not large enough to explain all the excess . in other words ,",
    "the excess needs to be resolved from other perspectives .",
    "furthermore , the increase in the number of events due to @xmath10 and @xmath11 at higher @xmath13 is more substantial in antineutrino than in neutrino data , which raises another interesting point : the neutrino and antineutrino respond differently to the two couplings .",
    "it is possible that , similar to photon production , the mechanism responsible for the excess can affect the event count differently in the two runs .",
    "hence the statement @xcite should be taken cautiously that the data in the _ antineutrino _ run above @xmath18 gev is without any unknown background solely because the _ neutrino _ run indicates so .",
    "the rest of this report is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : extrapolation ] , we show our high energy extrapolation of neutrino - induced pion production and compare it with available data .",
    "after that , sec .",
    "[ sec : event ] summarizes our computed photon event number distributions against different kinematic variables , and comparisons are made between them and the miniboone estimates .",
    "the uncertainty of our computation is discussed in detail there . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] , the report ends with a short summary and discussion .",
    "as intermediate states ; ( c ) and ( d ) have the nucleon as intermediate states ; ( e ) has a pion pole in the @xmath19 channel ; ( f ) includes the contact terms . ]    first , to benchmark our formalism , we apply it to the study of neutrino - induced pion production from free nucleons with neutrino energy up to @xmath20 gev , and check it against the existing data from anl and bnl experiments @xcite .",
    "the contributing feynman diagrams are similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] with the final photon lines changed to pion lines .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of these feynman diagrams included in our previous low energy pion production study .",
    "however , only the contributions from the @xmath1 resonance and nucleon intermediate states [ diagrams ( a)(b)(c ) and ( d ) ] are considered here .",
    "several contact terms ( besides @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) exist , whose high energy behavior is unknown , and hence are not discussed here . to extrapolate our previous calculations @xcite to higher energy , we make use of the fitted form factors of the axial transition currents ( @xmath21 ) in ref .",
    "the form factors of the vector transition currents are constrained by the corresponding electromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "the form factors of the nucleon currents [ as used in diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) ] are from ref .",
    "@xcite ( for the vector current ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( for the axial current ) .",
    "[ fig : pionprodnucleon ] plots charged current ( cc ) pion production data from the anl  @xcite and bnl  @xcite experiments .",
    "the former requires the final pion and nucleon center of mass energy @xmath22 to be less than @xmath23 , but no such cut is applied in the bnl data .",
    "two different calculations , with and without such a cut , are shown .",
    "we see that the `` no cut '' computation agrees reasonably well with the bnl data , while the `` with cut '' slightly overestimates the cross sections as indicated by the anl data , which strongly indicates that the contact terms if regularized can not be a dominant contribution in the @xmath14 gev region .",
    "second , let s proceed to nc photon production from nucleons by using the mentioned form factors and the procedure handling them  @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] shows a list of the diagrams .",
    "however , we can neglect the contributions from diagram ( e ) because of the @xmath24 suppression ( it contributes zero in coherent production ) . in diagram ( f ) , two couplings , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms , contribute here .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the two terms can be induced by the @xmath25 and @xmath26 anomalous couplings with the photon and @xmath0 boson ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) , but also emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite that other sources exist , including @xmath1 off - shell interactions . at low energy , we calibrated @xmath10 to be around @xmath29 by using coherent pion photoproduction data @xcite .",
    "the two terms contribute little in the production from nucleons and the incoherent production with neutrino energy up to @xmath9 gev @xcite , but can be relevant in the coherent production @xcite . to regularize their high energy behavior , we use the following form factors @xcite : @xmath30^{-3 }   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the momentum difference of the scattered nucleon in the interaction kernel .",
    "the total cross sections for the production from free protons and neutrons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_inc_xsection ] .",
    "for example , `` p(f ) '' corresponds to the production from free protons , while `` p(b ) '' is for the incoherent production from bound protons in @xmath32 , which will be addressed later . in each case , three calculations including different diagrams are shown : `` only @xmath1 '' has diagram ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] ; `` @xmath33 '' includes ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) and ( d ) ; `` full '' includes all the diagrams [ ( e ) is neglected as explained above ] . from now on ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath14 gev region because ( anti)neutrinos with higher energy are suppressed in the miniboone spectrum .",
    "clearly , the @xmath1 dominates in both neutrino and antineutrino scatterings . for the proton , adding @xmath34 contributions increases the cross section by @xmath35 , while for the neutron its contribution is less . in the `` full '' calculation , adding the contact terms , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , does not change the results at low energy @xmath38 gev , but increases the cross section well above @xmath14 gev ( they are more signficant in the antineutrino  induced than neutrino  induced productions ) .",
    "since the contact terms and the associated form factors are not well understood so far , the increases well beyond @xmath14 gev should be taken cautiously .",
    "third , to calculate the productions in neutrino - nucleus scattering , the medium - modification of the interaction kernel needs to be included .",
    "the ground state of the nucleus ( e.g. @xmath32 ) is computed in the mean - field approximation of qhd eft @xcite .",
    "we apply the local fermi gas approximation to calculate incoherent production and the `` optimal approximation '' for coherent production @xcite .",
    "the medium modifications have been checked against the inclusive electron-@xmath32 scattering and coherent photoproduction data @xcite . in principle , the available data @xcite for ( in)coherent neutrino - induced pion production from nuclei can be used to constrain theoretical models . however , before doing so , final state interaction of pions and nucleons have to be studied carefully , which is not the focus here .",
    "in addition , for coherent _ pion _ production , several contact terms besides @xmath10 [ ( f ) in fig .  [ fig : feynman ] with final photon line changed to pion line ] can be important @xcite , but their high energy behavior are not clear so far @xcite .",
    "fortunately , for photon production , the final state interaction can be ignored , and only two contact terms exists ( as motivated by the anomalous couplings ) , which makes the high energy extrapolation more tractable for neutrino energy up to @xmath39 gev .",
    "the total cross sections for incoherent nc photon production are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_inc_xsection ] in comparison with those from free nucleons .",
    "the labeling of the different curves have already been mentioned above .",
    "two parameters , @xmath40 , which are the meson-@xmath1 couplings and related to the @xmath1 binding and spin - orbit coupling , are set to be @xmath41 in these calculations .",
    "the incoherent production is not sensitive to different @xmath42 and @xmath43 values around @xmath41 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) .",
    "clearly , the @xmath1 contribution is reduced by @xmath44 compared to that from free nucleons in all the different channels .",
    "because of the opening of other decay channels ( e.g. @xmath45 ) , the @xmath1 width increases in the nucleus . as a result",
    ", the flux in the radiate decay channel is decreased .",
    "meanwhile , the nonresonant contributions from both @xmath34 and contact terms are reduced less , so the total cross sections for the full calculations are reduced less ( @xmath46 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : coh_xsection ] , we show the calculated total cross sections for coherent photon production in ( anti)neutrino-@xmath32 scattering . `` ( 1 , 1 ) '' for example indicates @xmath47 as mentioned before . results of using two different sets of diagrams are compared : @xmath33 includes contributions from both @xmath1 and @xmath34 , while the full calculation has all the diagrams .",
    "we can see the coherent production is indeed sensitive to @xmath40 and @xmath10 .",
    "the choices of them in the two `` full '' calculations are due to the calibration in ref .",
    "@xcite based on coherent pion photoproduction ( @xmath11 does not contribute in the isoscalar nucleus ) .",
    "interestingly , for each calculation the difference between the neutrino and antineutrino - induced production cross section is reduced with increasing ( anti)neutrino energy , which is consistent with previous discussion @xcite .",
    "in this section , we summarize our computation of the nc photon event numbers in miniboone .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath48 and @xmath5 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite : the median energy is around @xmath49 gev , and the maximum energy is up to @xmath50 gev .",
    "the proton on target ( pot ) numbers for the neutrino ( antineutrino ) run is @xmath51 . the total effective mass of the mineral oil ( @xmath52 ) detector is @xmath53 .",
    "the photon detection efficiency vs. photon energy is listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : photonefficiency ] . for photon energy",
    "higher than @xmath54 gev , we assume the efficiency to be @xmath55 , which should not cause mistakes because our calculations show that most photon events have energy lower than @xmath56 gev .    tabs .",
    "[ tab : summary_eqe ] and  [ tab : summary_eqe_anti ] list the photon event numbers against @xmath13 ( in three bins ) for neutrino and antineutrino runs ( the formula for reconstructing @xmath13 can be found in ref .",
    "the events are broken into different channels including coherent ( `` coh '' ) and incoherent ( `` inc '' ) production , and the production from unbound protons ( `` h '' ) .",
    "`` @xmath57 '' corresponds to the total number , to which miniboone s estimate and excess should be compared . in each entry",
    ", we list two numbers showing the lower and upper bound of our computation .",
    "the lower bound in all three channels is based on the `` @xmath33 '' calculation with @xmath58 , while the upper bound corresponds to the `` full calculation '' with @xmath59 [ for the production from free protons , @xmath60 are not relevant ] .",
    "see figs .",
    "[ fig : free_inc_xsection ] and  [ fig : coh_xsection ] and the text around them for a detailed discussion on the different calculations . comparing different calculations in these plots",
    ", we can see that the choice of the two bounds are reasonable . in both runs for the first two @xmath13 bins , _",
    "the difference between our upper bound and experimental estimate is not significant enough to explain the excess_. in the final @xmath13 bin , our upper bound is significantly larger than the estimate ; however , this difference should be taken cautiously because our simple regularization of contact terms that are mostly responsible for the upper - lower difference have not been well benchmarked . still , considering the large uncertainty of the excess in the final bin ,",
    "our results are consistent with the experimental estimate indicating no excess in this bin .",
    "another observation , as mentioned in the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , is that the contact - term induced event increase ( in percentage ) in the final bin is less in the neutrino run than in the antineutrino run , which means the two runs respond to the contact terms in different ways .",

    "the labeling has been mentioned above .",
    "we can see that the experimental estimates agree reasonably well with our results , except for the lowest @xmath16 bin ( @xmath17 $ ] gev ) in which their estimates fall below our lower bounds in both neutrino and antineutrino runs .",
    "this is perhaps due to our inclusion of nonresonant diagram contributions , which is not manifestly included in the experimental estimates .    comparing our results with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can see that with the updated photon detection efficiencies used here , our results are generally smaller than those in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : extrapolation ] , we have shown that nuclear effects tend to reduce the total cross section substantially , which is also reflected in the event number computation .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the total cross sections for nc photon production and computed the photon production event numbers vs. reconstructed neutrino energy @xmath13 and photon energy @xmath16 for miniboone .",
    "two contact terms @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( with reasonable form factors ) that are partially related to the proposed anomalous photon-@xmath0-meson couplings are also discussed here .",
    "the other two parameters @xmath60 that control the @xmath1 binding and spin - orbit coupling in the nucleus are another source of uncertainty in our calculations .",
    "previously based on inclusive electron - nucleus scattering data and phenomenological fits of the @xmath1 spin - orbit coupling in the study of pion - nucleus scattering , we set @xmath60 to be around @xmath41 . the further study of coherent pion photoproduction shows fixing @xmath60 is entangled with @xmath10 : two sets , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , are allowed .    to test the neutrino - nucleon interaction kernel with neutrino energy @xmath14 gev , the corresponding pion production with @xmath1 and @xmath34 contributions",
    "included has been shown to be in good agreement with available data .",
    "based on the transition and other form factors as benchmarked in pion production , we calculate the total cross section for photon production , including contributions from free nucleons , incoherent production , and coherent production in the high neutrino energy region . as we can see , the regularized @xmath10 and @xmath11 contributions are relatively small compared to @xmath33 in all the photon production channels until neutrino energy goes beyond @xmath79 gev , which indicates our full calculation with the two contact terms provides a conservative upper bound in the event count .",
    "we treat the @xmath33 contribution as the lower bound .",
    "based on the two bounds , we conclude that the difference ( our count @xmath80 miniboone s estimate ) is not significant enough to explain the excess with @xmath13 below @xmath15 gev in both neutrino and antineutrino runs . for @xmath13 above @xmath15 gev , although our result ( upper bound ) is significantly larger than the estimate , it is still compatible with no excess within the given uncertainty range . for the @xmath16 distribution ,",
    "again the experimental estimates agree with our results , except that in the lowest bins in both runs , ours are larger than their estimates but the differences could not explain all the excess in those bins .",
    "hence , other perspectives need to be explored to understand the low energy excess in miniboone .",
    "in addition , the two contact terms provide an exemplary mechanism to which the neutrino and antineutrino runs in miniboone respond differently . as a result",
    ", the nonexistence of low energy excess beyond @xmath15 gev in the former does not immediately indicate it is also true in the latter and vice versa .    to eliminate the uncertainty in the neutrino - nucleon interaction kernel",
    ", a model independent approach needs to be implemented , for example the dispersion analysis , which is currently begin pursued .",
    "moreover , this is also relevant to the known @xmath81 @xmath0 box diagram in the study of parity violation of electron - nucleon ( nucleus ) scattering .",
