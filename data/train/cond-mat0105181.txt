    "binary collisions are the essential mechanism for the formation of a bose - einstein condensate in an atomic gas . moreover , many aspects of the system s dynamics require two - particle collisions , for example , sound propagation , the damping of elementary excitations , and the very mechanism that leads to the quantum phase transition  evaporative cooling . however , the conventional hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach to generalize the gross - pitaevskii equation for dilute , trapped gases includes binary collisional interactions only as first - order energy shifts .",
    "second - order kinetic theories that include collisional redistributions of excited atoms offer a more complete microscopic description of the gaseous system .",
    "why is a simplified kinetic description possible , when the evolution of the bose - einstein condensate might involve correlations between as many particles as the system contains ? would not binary collisions eventually entangle the quantum state of each atom in the system with that of every other atom ? fortunately , such complexity is not necessary to describe the measurable properties of a dilute , weakly interacting gas , because the duration of a collision , @xmath0 , is very short compared to the essentially interaction - free oscillation in the external potential between isolated collision events  @xcite .    because of this characteristic separation of time scales , correlations that arise during an individual collision decay rapidly before the next collision takes place",
    "this rapid decay , in turn , implies the possibility of a markov approximation , which assumes that only the current configuration of the system determines its future evolution .",
    "furthermore , this decay of correlations allows us to parametrize the system s state by a reduced set of master variables , because we are interested in the system s time evolution only on the kinetic time scale , i.e. , for times large compared to the duration of a collision  @xmath0 .",
    "this reduced description with a set of master variables is possible , because for kinetic times the higher - order correlation functions can be expressed as functionals of these variables  @xcite .",
    "this set of master variables is common to both kinetic theories we will discuss : in the kadanoff - baym approach , abstract real - time green s functions parametrize the condensating gas , whereas in the walser _ et al .",
    "_  case  @xcite , single - time density matrices , which contain the physical density and coherences of thermal atoms , as well as the mean field , represent the system .",
    "the equivalence of these two approaches is a general principle in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not trivial to verify this fact in detail by explicitly connecting the complementary microscopic equations .",
    "strictly speaking , we state equivalence after the kadanoff - baym theory has been restricted to single - time quantities using the markov approximation .",
    "we present the formulation of the quantum kinetic theory of dilute bose - einstein condensed gases in terms of nonequilibrium , real - time green s functions and their kadanoff - baym equations of motion  @xcite , which were generalized in refs .",
    "@xcite to include the condensate .    by transforming these equations to the single - particle energy basis and taking the single - time limit of the two - time green s functions by means of the markov approximation",
    ", we reproduce the equations of motion of the walser _ et al .",
    "_  kinetic theory as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , thus providing an independent confirmation of these equations .",
    "following imamovi - tomasovi and griffin  @xcite , we use the gapless beliaev approximation for the self - energies in the kadanoff - baym equations , and thus prove the walser _ et al .",
    "_  kinetic theory to be gapless as well .",
    "we begin the introduction to the kadanoff - baym description of the dilute bose gas by defining its variables . neglecting three - body interactions ,",
    "the second - quantized many - body hamiltonian  @xmath1 describing the atoms is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bosonic creation operator and @xmath4 the binary interaction potential .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath5 contains the kinetic energy of a boson with mass  @xmath6 and the external potential  @xmath7 .    to represent the master variables in terms of nonequilibrium green s functions , we first write the system s degrees of freedom in terms of spinor operators  @xcite @xmath8 where we now follow kadanoff - baym and abbreviate @xmath9 . the master variables",
    "are then contained in the following two - time propagators : @xmath10 where  @xmath11 denotes the grand - canonical average and  @xmath12 the time ordering operator , which sorts its arguments in order of decreasing time .",
    "these two propagators are defined for real times by analytic continuation of the finite - temperature propagators for imaginary time , following  ( * ? ? ?",
    "we subtract the condensate propagator  @xmath13 from the full propagator  @xmath14 and thus define the green s function for the fluctuations @xmath15 the two time orderings of  @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 define the generalized two - time fluctuation - density matrices .",
    "this can be seen by explicitly writing these two time orderings in terms of the fluctuating part  @xmath19 of the field operators , @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 where we defined the two - time normal  ( @xmath22 ) and anomalous  ( @xmath23 ) averages of the fluctuations in the position basis as @xmath24 in the case  @xmath25 , the propagators in eqs .  and",
    "correspond to the dynamical quantities in the kinetic equations for the fluctuations given in eqs .",
    "( 24 )  and  ( 25 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ; for  @xmath25 , the averages in eq .",
    "correspond to the density of thermal atoms around the condensate and correlations between these atoms .",
    "we have thus represented the condensate ( @xmath13 ) and its fluctuations ( @xmath26 ) and can now look for their corresponding evolution equations .",
    "the equations of motion for the nonequilibrium green s functions @xmath13  and  @xmath26 are the kadanoff - baym equations ; these equations are equivalent to the dyson equation . in the second part of this section",

    ", we use the definition of the matrix inverse of the interaction - free propagator  @xmath34 , @xmath35 with the third pauli matrix  @xmath36 and an energy shift  @xmath37 , which removes mean - field oscillations .",
    "we define the @xmath38  function by  @xmath39 and integration  @xmath40 as integration  @xmath41 over time within the given time limits and  @xmath42 over all space .",
    "the approximations we choose for the hartree - fock self - energies for the condensate @xmath43 and for the fluctuations @xmath44 as well as the second - order collisional self - energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 will be discussed below .",
    "kadanoff and baym derived these equations without including the condensate  @xcite and de dominicis and martin formulated a very general mathematical account  @xcite .",
    "the green s function formalism traces back to schwinger  @xcite and originally made use of the correspondence between the partition function and the time evolution operator in imaginary time ( @xmath47 for @xmath48 ) . to get information about measurable quantities ,",
    "the dynamic variables and equations of motion were extended to real times by analytic continuation ( see ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "8)  and  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this nonequilibrium green s function description was developed @xmath49  years ago to eventually explain the behavior of superfluid helium  @xcite .",
    "since this description involves a weak - coupling approximation but helium atoms are strongly interacting , the results at that time were disappointing and , for example , could not explain all predictions of the phenomenological landau model .",
    "however , since the green s function description holds for a dilute , weakly interacting gas , its application to bose - einstein condensation in this system is more appropriate .    to complete our exposition of the kadanoff - baym equations  through",
    ", we have to choose the hartree - fock and collisional self - energies .",
    "we draw the hartree - fock self - energy diagrams for both the condensate  @xmath13 and the thermal cloud  @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig_hf ] and write them , respectively , as @xmath50 and @xmath51 with the local - time , binary interaction potential  @xmath52 and the matrix trace @xmath53 .",
    "when we evaluate the time - ordered propagator  @xmath14 at equal times , we follow the convention @xmath54 .    , the wiggly lines the condensate propagator  @xmath13 , and the dashed lines the interaction potential  @xmath55 .",
    "the first two terms give the energy shifts due to both the mean field  @xmath56 and the normal fluctuations  @xmath57 . the third term in  @xmath43",
    "gives rise to a factor of 2 for  @xmath57 and to  @xmath58 .",
    "the fourth term which only appears in  @xmath44 causes the difference in the mean - field shifts that are experienced by the condensate and the fluctuations , respectively . ]    for the second - order collisional self - energies  @xmath59 we choose the gapless and conserving beliaev approximation  @xcite .",
    "this means that , compared to kane and kadanoff  @xcite , we include the exchange terms , which they deliberately excluded to obtain the simplest conserving approximation as proven in  @xcite , and compared to hohenberg and martin  @xcite , we include the terms containing no condensate contributions , which will give rise to the quantum boltzmann terms for the fluctuations .",
    "we depict the resulting self - energy diagrams in fig .",

    "@xmath16  and  @xmath13 as in fig .",

    "we now demonstrate the key steps that connect the kinetic theory presented in the previous section to the work of walser _",
    "et al._presented in  @xcite : we rewrite the kadanoff - baym eqs .  through   in the single - particle energy ( spe ) basis and obtain the equations of motion for the master variables  the measurable quantities in our reduced description of the system  in this basis , exactly as given in the walser _ et al . _  paper .",
    "first , we define our master variables in the spe  basis @xmath67 and determine their relation to their position basis counterparts , the green s functions given in eqs .  , ,  and  .",
    "the time - dependent , two - component mean - field state vector @xmath68 is defined in terms of @xmath69 and also contains the time - reversed mean field  @xmath70 .",

    "second , we can recognize the fluctuation - density matrix  @xmath75 as the single - time limit of its position - basis counterpart  @xmath30 in eq .  .",
    "the mean - field state vector  @xmath79 , on the other hand , can be combined with its hermitian conjugate into the matrix  @xmath80 , which corresponds to  @xmath27 in eq .  .",
    "we thus define  @xmath81 .",
    "this allows us to explicitly connect the condensate mean - field state vectors  @xmath82 expressed in the position basis and  @xmath83 in the spe  basis as follows : @xmath84 with a time - independent @xmath85 transformation matrix  @xmath86 .",
    "because of the completeness of the position basis , we can also write @xmath87 for the fluctuation density , we obtain similarly @xmath88 and @xmath89    we can now use the transformation eq .   to write the condensate s hartree - fock self - energy  @xmath90 in eq .",
