    "a two - valley ( 2v ) two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas ( eg ) is the simplest model to describe electrons confined in solid state devices such as si - mosfets @xcite and certain quantum wells @xcite . in this 2d model , electrons interact via a @xmath0 potential in a uniform neutralizing background and possess an additional discrete degree of freedom ( the valley index ) .",
    "one may identify electrons with given spin projection and valley index as belonging to a different species or _",
    "we focus on the case of two symmetric valleys , where the number of up ( down ) spin electrons is the same for both valleys . in this case at zero temperature the 2deg is completely characterized in terms of the coupling parameter @xmath1 and the spin polarization @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the total electron density , @xmath4 the bohr radius , @xmath5 the density of up ( down ) spin electrons ) .",
    "the interest in the properties of the 2deg has been strongly revived in the last years due to the experimental discovery of a previously unexpected metal - insulator transition @xcite in which the valley degree of freedom appears to play an important role @xcite .",
    "the transition takes place at low density , where an accurate treatment of electron correlation is crucial . in this respect ,",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations have provided over the years the method of choice for microscopic studies @xcite of the 2deg .",
    "we have recently provided an analytic expression of the correlation energy of the 2v2deg @xcite . here , we focus on the pair distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which are strictly related to the description of exchange and correlation properties of the system ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , pdfs may serve a variety of purposes , among which the estimate of finite thickness effects on the 2deg spin susceptibility @xcite , applications in dft calculations , or a test of the accuracy of hypernetted - chain calculations @xcite .",
    "the pdf is related to the probability of finding two electrons at positions @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the _ component - resolved _ pdf @xmath8 of a multicomponent 2deg is defined as @xcite @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 denoting creation and annihilation field operators , @xmath12 the expectation value on the ground state and @xmath13 the electron density of the component @xmath14 .",
    "the normalization is such that @xmath15 , in case there is neither exchange nor correlation . in a homogeneous and isotropic system",
    ", @xmath16 depends only on the relative distance @xmath17 and there is symmetry for index permutations ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "if @xmath19 is the concentration of the component @xmath14 , the total ( _ component - summed _ ) pdf @xmath20 reads @xmath21    in the 2v2deg , @xmath22 is a composite index which denotes the spin and valley ( respectively @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) degrees of freedom and spans the four cases @xmath25 . in general , for 2v there are ten different @xmath16 , but in the case of two symmetric valleys the number of different @xmath16 is two for @xmath26 and five for @xmath27 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the following",
    "we shall denote the different @xmath16 with one of the possible different labels ( _ e.g. _ for @xmath27 @xmath28 ) .",
    "most of the simulation details are the same as in ref .",
    "we performed fixed - phase dmc simulations ( for a review of qmc techniques see _ e.g. _ ref  @xcite ) for @xmath29 and @xmath30 . to reduce the finite size effects , we used twist - averaged boundary conditions ( tabc ) @xcite , which also allow to change @xmath31 by flipping any number of spins at fixed number of electrons @xmath32 . to sample the pdfs we performed simulations for a system of @xmath33 electrons .",
    "time steps were chosen at the different @xmath34 to give an acceptance rate corresponding to @xmath35 .",
    "we did simulations with 320 walkers .",
    "the twist grid is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used a slater - jastrow trial wave function @xmath36 , but , here , we considered only plane - wave nodes , since the more accurate backflow ( bf ) nodes yield only slight modifications to the pdfs @xcite .",
    "besides , bf effects on the energy were shown to be bigger in the two - component case than in the four - component system @xcite .",
    "dmc provides the mixed estimate of an operator @xmath37 , _ i.e. _ @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 denoting the ground state of the system ) .",
    "if @xmath37 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath40 , @xmath41 coincides with the expectation value on the true ground state @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath37 does not commute with @xmath40 ( as in the case here considered ) , it is better to compute the extrapolated estimate @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the variational mc expectation value on @xmath36 ) which is accurate to second order in the difference @xmath44 between @xmath39 and @xmath36 .",
    "and @xmath45 .",

    "[ 2vspinresolved - z01]-[2vspinresolved - zno01 ] we show representative examples of 2v component - resolved pdfs for @xmath26 and finite @xmath31 respectively .",
    "all lenghts are given in units of @xmath46 .",
    "the component - resolved pdfs shown in fig .",
    "[ 2vspinresolved - z01 ] illustrate the tendency to a local order which favors electrons belonging to different species ( as e.g. @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) to get closer than electrons belonging to the same species . for intermediate spin polarizations",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ 2vspinresolved - zno01 ] ) the component - resolved pdfs exhibit a richer structure than the @xmath26 cases , with qualitative features clearly related to the interplay of exchange and correlations ( for example , in the density range considered the diagonal pdf of the minority component in a strongly polarized system is found to be determined by exchange alone , to a very good approximation ) .",
    "the significant spin - polarization dependence seen in the component - resolved pdfs almost disappears in the total pdfs , particularly at large @xmath34 .",
    "this can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ 2vspinsummed ] ( left panel ) , which shows the total pdfs for a high density ( @xmath49 ) and a low density ( @xmath50 ) case with zero and full spin polarization .",
    "the dependence of the total pdf on @xmath34 is depicted in fig .  [ 2vspinsummed ] for @xmath51 .",
    "we see that even for @xmath34 as small as 1 the effect of exchange on the total pdf , which is expected to decrease with the number @xmath52 of ( equally populated ) components , is already very small for @xmath53 .     and",
