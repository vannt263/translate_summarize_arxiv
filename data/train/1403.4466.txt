    "recently significant experimental progress has been achieved in studying weak heavy - to - light decays of @xmath6 mesons . for the semileptonic @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "decays not only total decay branching fractions were measured by belle and babar collaborations @xcite rather precisely but also differential distributions in rather narrow @xmath2 bins .",
    "such measurements are very important since they provide the test of the momentum dependence of the weak differential decay branching fractions and thus significantly constrain theoretical models .",
    "it also allows us to extract the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath7 from exclusive decay channels with better precision and confront it with the value obtained from inclusive semileptonic decays . moreover , recently the lhcb collaboration @xcite reported first observation of the rare @xmath8 decay with the branching fraction @xmath9 .",
    "such decays are governed by the flavour changing neutral current and thus are very sensitive to the contributions of new intermediate particles and interactions .",
    "therefore the study of rare @xmath6 decays is important for constraining the theories which go beyond the standard model .",
    "since these decays are induced by loop diagrams they are suppressed by at least three orders of magnitude compared to corresponding heavy - to - light semileptonic @xmath6 decays .",
    "observation of the rare @xmath10 decay signifies an important progress since this decay is stronger ckm suppressed compared with better studied @xmath11 decays .    theoretical investigation of weak decays requires the determination of the decay matrix elements of the weak current between meson states .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize these decay matrix elements in terms of the invariant form factors .",
    "the calculation of these form factors demands application of the nonperturbative methods . since these decays are governed by the heavy - to - light quark transitions they have a very broad kinematical range .",
    "various theoretical approaches were used to calculate these form factors . however most of the employed methods allow determination of the momentum transfer dependence of the form factors only in a",
    "rather limited @xmath2 range .",
    "for example light cone qcd sum rules are applicable in the large recoil region ( @xmath12 ) while lattice qcd provides results at small recoil ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore some model assumptions and/or parametrizations should be used to extrapolate the results in the whole range of @xmath2 , thus introducing additional theoretical uncertainties .    in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we investigated the rare @xmath14 and rare @xmath15 decays in the framework of the relativistic quark model with the qcd motivated quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction . calculating the decay form factors we systematically took into account relativistic effects including transformations of the meson wave functions from the rest to the moving reference frame and contributions of the intermediate negative - energy states .",
    "all form factors are expressed through the usual overlap integrals of the meson wave functions , which are known from the previous mass spectrum considerations @xcite . the important advantage of the developed method consists in the fact that it provides explicit calculation of the momentum transfer dependence of the form factors in the whole kinematical range , thus improving the reliability of the obtained results . here",
    "we apply this approach for studying the rare @xmath16 decays .",
    "evaluation of such decay branching fractions requires calculation of the matrix elements of weak vector , axial vector and tensor currents . in ref .",
    "@xcite we calculated the form factors parametrizing matrix elements of the weak vector and axial vector currents for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 transitions and on this basis studied the corresponding semileptonic decays @xmath19 . we first confront the predictions of our model with new detailed belle and babar data @xcite on heavy - to - light semileptonic decays .",
    "such comparison provides additional test the @xmath2 dependence of the form factors .",
    "then we apply the model for the calculation of the tensor form factors . on this basis",
    "the differential distributions and total decay branching fractions as well as the forward - backward asymmetry and the @xmath20 polarization fractions are calculated and confronted with available experimental data and other theoretical predictions .",
    "the matrix elements of the weak current for the heavy - to - light @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) weak transitions between the initial @xmath6 meson and final pseudoscalar @xmath21 or vector @xmath20 mesons are usually parametrized by the following set of invariant form factors .",
