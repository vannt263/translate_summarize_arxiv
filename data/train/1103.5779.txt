    "evidence for the existence of non - baryonic dark matter has been accumulating for many decades .",
    "combined constraints from measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation , the shape of the galaxy power spectrum , and the hubble constant fix both the total matter and the baryon densities , indicating that non - baryonic dark matter makes up 85% of the matter density of the universe @xcite . despite the preponderance of evidence for its existence , however , little is known about the identity of the dark matter .",
    "one way to glean information about the properties of this mysterious substance is through _ indirect detection _ , the observation of the annihilation products of dark matter particles .",
    "indirect detection is an attractive prospect for several reasons .",
    "its primary advantage is that , while dark matter itself is very difficult to detect , the annihilation products of dark matter particles may be easily detectable . if photons are produced in dark matter annihilations , for instance , existing telescopes can detect them . another attractive feature of indirect detection is that the velocity - weighted , thermally averaged annihilation cross section of the dark matter , @xmath6 , which governs the expected indirect detection signal , is constrained if the dark matter is a thermal relic .",
    "additionally , indirect detection has the potential to reveal information about the distribution of dark matter beyond our local environment .",
    "for these and other reasons , indirect detection nicely compliments the other techniques that may be used to identify dark matter : direct detection and collider searches @xcite .",
    "it is likely that all three techniques will be necessary for a definitive identification of the dark matter .",
    "the present is an exciting time for indirect detection as a number of experiments are currently underway that are capable of detecting a signal from dark matter annihilations .",
    "neutrino detectors such as icecube and amanda @xcite , air cherenkov detectors such as h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite and veritas @xcite , cosmic ray detectors such as pamela @xcite , and space based telescopes such as the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fgst ) @xcite are all poised to make important contributions to the indirect detection of dark matter .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the possibility of using data taken by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the fgst to constrain the properties of dark matter . the lat is a wide field , pair conversion telescope that covers an energy range from about 20 mev to 300 gev @xcite .",
    "gamma - rays are particularly well suited for indirect detection because they are relatively easy to detect , they are produced in many models of dark matter annihilation , and they propagate through the universe with small optical depth ( especially at low energies ) .    unfortunately ,",
    "although may in principle contain significant information about dark matter , the process of extracting this information is severely complicated by the presence of large and uncertain backgrounds to the dark matter signal .",
    "the primary challenge of indirect detection using is therefore to extract a signal which may be hidden in backgrounds that are larger by orders of magnitude .",
    "two primary features of the detected photons are their energy and arrival direction . a number of studies have used these two features to extract the dark matter signal from the background . for example , ref .",
    "@xcite used only energy information , while ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite used both the spectral and angular distribution information .",
    "given the photon counts , derived quantities can also be used to distinguish the signal from the backgrounds .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) has been proposed as a discriminant by a number of groups  @xcite .",
    "anisotropy of the distribution , especially when combined with spectral information , has also been proposed as a powerful way of extracting the signal  @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a new and robust approach for constraining dark matter from data that uses only the angular distribution of the photons .",
    "we rely on two important aspects of the dark matter signal to help separate it from backgrounds .",
    "first , part of the expected signal from dark matter in our galaxy is smooth ( i.e. variations from the mean flux in nearby pixels are uncorrelated ) .",
    "second , the dark matter signal comes from a nearly spherically symmetric halo , so the signal is azimuthally symmetric about the axis connecting us to the center of our galaxy .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the backgrounds , which are heavily concentrated near the disk of the galaxy .",
    "more generally , astrophysical backgrounds have different morphologies and may be clumped ( i.e. variations from the mean flux may be correlated in nearby pixels ) .",
    "these differences between the signal and the backgrounds allow us to remove some of the contribution from the backgrounds to place an interesting limit on the dark matter .",
    "the approach , which we call a _ ring analysis _ , makes very minimal assumptions about the nature of the signal and no assumptions about the backgrounds .",
    "therefore , this approach is very conservative and will lead to robust limits on the properties of the dark matter .    in  [ sec : data ] we describe the way we processed the fermi lat data to generate photon count and exposure maps . in ",
    "[ sec : ringanalysis ] we present the ring analysis technique that we have developed for constraining the presence of an azimuthally symmetric signal on the sky .",
    "consider an annulus centered on the axis connecting us to the galactic center , identified by the angle @xmath7 between this axis and the annulus .",
    "the ring analysis results in an upper limit on any contribution to the flux that is uniform in this annulus . fig .",
    "[ fig : ring_psi_plot ] presents these upper limits on the uniform flux from the fermi lat data .",
    "transforming these upper limits into constraints on the properties of dark matter particles requires a number of steps and assumptions .",
    "these , and in particular the uncertainties involved , are discussed in  [ sec : application ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the fermi lat is a pair conversion detector that operates roughly in the energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev .",
    "a scintillating anti - coincidence detector allows for the rejection of contaminating high energy particle events .",
    "the specifications of the detector are described in detail in ref .",
    "our analysis is based on lat data downloaded in the form of weekly all - sky releases from the fermi science support center website at http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov / ssc / data/.    even with the on - board anti - coincidence detector there is a residual background of particles that are misclassified as by the lat detectors .",
    "this poses a challenge for our analysis because these misinterpreted cosmic rays constitute a potentially large and uncertain background .",
    "the fermi collaboration has made public the dataclean event class which implements several data cuts to minimize cosmic ray contamination as well as improved particle background and instrument modeling .",
    "their data selection techniques and event modeling are described in ref .",
    "we restrict our analysis to only the events labeled as dataclean and use the corresponding p6_v3_dataclean instrument response function to calculate exposure maps .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we confine our analysis to those events coming from zenith angles @xmath8 in order to reduce contamination by produced in cosmic ray interactions with the earth s atmosphere . the resulting data set amounts to an exposure of roughly @xmath9 across the sky covering a date range from 2008 - 08 - 04 to 2010 - 12 - 07 .",
    "we produce photon count and exposure maps using the _ gadget _ package , a set of software routines designed for use with the lat data by the fermi collaboration @xcite . in generating the maps",
    ", the data were divided into 29 energy bins between 1 gev and 100 gev , logarithmically spaced in energy .",
    "this restriction in energy was chosen because the lat performance is well characterized in this energy range . because the generation of these maps is computationally intensive , the data were processed in parallel on the fulla computing cluster at fermilab .",
    "the maps generated using the _ gadget _ software were then converted to the healpix isolatitude pixelization scheme with @xmath10 , corresponding to a pixel size of roughly @xmath11 ( comparable to the width of the point spread function ( psf ) of fermi at the lowest energy we consider ) .",
    "[ fig : skymap ] shows the resulting all - sky map in the energy range @xmath12 .",
    "the ring analysis technique that we develop in this paper is a method for constraining the presence of a signal on the sky that satisfies two requirements : 1 ) it is azimuthally symmetric , and 2 ) variations from the mean signal at any zenith angle are uncorrelated from one pixel to the next . as we discuss in  [ sec : application ] , the annihilation signal from smooth dark matter is expected to satisfy these two requirements , and we can quantify the extent to which the signal deviates from these conditions . in this section , however , we make no reference to the nature of the signal itself .",
    "a consequence of these two features is that the signal in each pixel of a ring of constant @xmath7 ( where @xmath7 is the zenith angle ) can be considered to be drawn independently from some underlying distribution . in the statistical literature , such a signal",
    "is referred to as independent and identically distributed , or i.i.d . the constraint will be on the amplitude of any i.i.d .",
    "component of the data . in the case of interest ,",
    "the backgrounds dwarf the signal and the background flux in each pixel may depend on nearby pixels and may vary as a function of the angle transverse to @xmath7 , which we label @xmath13 .",
    "consider a ring on the sky of constant @xmath7 defined by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 labels the central @xmath7 of the @xmath16th ring , and @xmath17 is its angular width . since we have divided the sky into pixels , we define @xmath18 to be the flux in the @xmath19th pixel ( labeled by its azimuth angle @xmath20 ) of ring @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the pixels have been sorted in terms of @xmath20 so that , for example , pixels @xmath19 and @xmath21 appear adjacent to each other on the sky ; such sorting preserves any non - i.i.d .",
    "component of the data .",
    "the flux @xmath18 receives contributions from an i.i.d .",
    "component due to the signal , @xmath22 , and contributions from some possibly non - i.i.d .",
    "components due to the backgrounds , @xmath23 ( see upper panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : ring_phi_plot ] for an illustration ) .",
    "our goal is to obtain an upper limit on the mean contribution from the signal .",
    "consider the fluxes in all pixels in the ring shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring_phi_plot ] .",
    "this sequence is clearly _ not _ i.i.d . because of the peaks at @xmath24 .",
    "that is , the flux in the pixel at @xmath25 is clearly correlated with the flux in nearby pixels .",
    "the physical reason for this is clear as well : these values of @xmath13 correspond to the plane of the galaxy where backgrounds are particularly large .",
    "the mean flux of any i.i.d .",
    "signal in this ring is clearly much smaller than the flux at the peaks .",
    "choosing as a constraint the mean flux in all pixels is also not optimal as the plane of the galaxy is distorting the mean .",
    "rather , we expect the constraint on the mean i.i.d .",
    "flux to be at the level of the flux away from these peaks .",
    "one way to arrive at this systematically is to :    * start with the observed distribution ( @xmath18 ) and note that it is not an i.i.d .",
    "sequence * create a flux threshold ( @xmath26 ) and remove all pixels with flux above the threshold * test and see if the resulting ( truncated ) sequence ( @xmath27 ) is consistent with being i.i.d .",
    "* if the truncated sequence is not consistent with an i.i.d .",
    "distribution , lower the threshold and repeat * once the truncated distribution is consistent with i.i.d .",
    ", any i.i.d .",
    "component will generally have mean flux that is below the median of the truncated sequence , @xmath28 , so this median value becomes the upper limit on the i.i.d .",
    "flux in the ring ( there are exceptions to this statement , an issue which we address below )    to determine whether a given @xmath29 is i.i.d .",
    ", we use the brock , dechert and scheinkman ( bds ) statistic @xcite .",
    "the bds statistic tests the null hypothesis that a sequence is i.i.d . by measuring the degree of spatial correlation in the sequence .",
    "in essence , this is accomplished by searching for sub - sequences of length @xmath30 that are significantly different from other @xmath30-long sub - sequences in the data ; the value of @xmath30 is referred to as the ` embedding dimension ' .",
    "the null hypothesis can be rejected if the bds statistic falls outside of some desired confidence interval ; in our analysis we use a @xmath31 confidence limit . see ref.@xcite for an introduction to the bds statistic . to implement the bds test we use a code made available in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the test itself depends on two parameters : the maximum embedding dimension , @xmath32 , and a parameter @xmath33 which effects how the discrepancy between different @xmath30-sequences is measured . following the recommendations of ref .",
    "@xcite , we use @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the standard deviation of @xmath29 and @xmath36 ; we find , however , that our results are not very sensitive to the choices of these parameters .",
    "the results of the bds test can be easily checked by eye ; any non - i.i.d .",
    "behavior is obvious to the eye as spatial clumping .",
    "ideally , the limit we derive through this method will be significantly lower than the mean flux in the ring , @xmath37 , because we have effectively removed the contributions to the ring that are not i.i.d .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ring_phi_plot ] shows the initial @xmath18 for a particular ring on the sky ; the lower panel shows @xmath29 , where @xmath38 has been determined using the bds test .",
    "there are several important qualifications to the above discussion .",
    "first , it is possible to engineer pathological signals and backgrounds such that the limit determined by the ring analysis method is actually lower than the mean signal flux .",
    "any realistic astrophysical sources are unlikely to have such pathological distributions , however .",
    "second , the point spread function ( psf ) of the fermi telescope at 1 gev is comparable to the size of our pixels ; one might worry that the non - zero psf could lead to correlations between pixels that would invalidate the i.i.d .",
    "property of the signal .",
    "third , the statistical literature recommends that the bds test be used only on data sets that are large , preferably with more than 500 elements @xcite . in our analysis , however , we apply the test to data sets with as few as 50 elements , clearly pushing the limits of the bds test .",
    "finally , if the signal is a smoothly varying function of @xmath7 then it will not have a constant value in any ring of finite angular width since different pixels at fixed @xmath15 integrate over the flux with different weighting over @xmath7 .",
    "all of the above issues can be addressed through the application of monte carlo tests . by applying the ring analysis technique to simulated data sets",
    ", we can determine to what extent and under what conditions our constraints are valid .",
    "since we aim only to place an upper limit on the mean flux of an i.i.d .",
    "component in the data , the relevant statistic for evaluating the success of the ring analysis technique is the ratio of the calculated upper limit on the i.i.d . flux , @xmath39 , to the mean i.i.d .",
    "flux , @xmath40 .",
    "ideally , @xmath41 will always be greater than one ( so that our constraint is valid ) but not much greater than one ( so that the constraint is as tight as possible ) .",
    "we wish to characterize how this statistic varies as a function of the mean i.i.d .",
    "we generate mock data sets by combining a simulated i.i.d .",
    "signal and a simulated background .",
    "these mock data sets are then analyzed using the ring analysis technique and its performance is evaluated .",
    "the mock i.i.d .",
    "component is drawn randomly from a poisson distribution with a desired mean .",
    "the random draws ensure that the signal is in fact i.i.d . and the assumption of a poisson distribution is justified for most astrophysical sources . for the background model",
    ", it makes sense to use the observed data itself since the data is likely background dominated .",
    "however , since any i.i.d .",
    "component to the background will increase @xmath41 , we subtract the determined i.i.d .",
    "flux from the observed background to generate our background model .",
    "this is the most conservative test of our analysis : if the true background contains any i.i.d .",
    "component then the true @xmath41 can only be larger than the @xmath41 measured in the monte carlo trials .",
    "one might worry that the point spread function ( psf ) of the fgst could lead to correlations between pixels that might disturb the i.i.d .",
    "nature of the underlying signal .",
    "the width of the fgst psf is a declining function of energy ; at the lowest energy that we consider ( 1 gev ) , the 68% containment angle is slightly less than 1 degree ( for normal incidence ; the psf broadens slightly when the incidence angle is beyond about @xmath42 ) .",
    "consequently , the width of the psf at the lowest energies considered is comparable to the size of our @xmath43 pixels . to account for effects of the psf we applying a gaussian smoothing kernel to the mock signal with a standard deviation of @xmath44 pixels .",
    "since the psf actually gets narrower at higher energies , the application of such a smoothing kernel to all of the photon data is conservative ; at high energies we are overestimating the size of the psf .    as mentioned above",
    ", we do not expect the signal in an angular ring of finite width to be exactly constant even if the signal is azimuthally symmetric since the signal is a smoothly varying function . to account for this possibility in our monte carlo tests we introduce a variation in the mean signal flux that amounts to a @xmath45 decrease across the ring .",
    "this value is chosen because it is characteristic of the variation in the smooth dark matter signal in which we are ultimately interested .",
    "[ fig : threshold_bounds ] presents the results of our monte carlo tests of the ring analysis method .",
    "the figure shows the quantity @xmath41 for the mock data sets as a function of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mean background flux ( the signal and background have been simulated as described above with the effects of the psf and the smoothly varying signal included ) . for each value of @xmath47",
    "we drew 1000 realizations of the i.i.d . signal .",
    "the shaded region indicates the 95% confidence interval for these 1000 mock data sets .",
    "[ fig : threshold_bounds ] reveals that the ring analysis technique is performing essentially as hoped : @xmath41 is always larger than one and it stays close to one over a fairly large range of @xmath40 . for very low @xmath40",
    "the signal makes essentially no contribution to the data and the flux threshold therefore stays constant ; consequently @xmath48 in this regime .",
    "[ fig : ring_psi_plot ] shows the upper limits on an i.i.d .",
    "component in the fermi data derived using the ring analysis technique as a function of the angle @xmath7 from the galactic center .",
    "as one moves away from the galactic center ( i.e. towards @xmath49 ) , the limit becomes tighter simply because the flux is lower ; beyond @xmath50 the limit becomes weaker again as we look toward the galactic anticenter . in generating fig .",
    "[ fig : ring_psi_plot ] we divided the sky into 45 rings of equal width in @xmath7 .",
    "the bds threshold curve is shown only for those rings for which the test could be conducted on more than 50 pixels in accordance with the results of our monte carlo simulations . as can be seen from the figure , the bds threshold is significantly more constraining than the mean flux in the ring .    as a consistency check on our results ,",
    "we compare the minimum threshold flux in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring_psi_plot ] ( which occurs near @xmath50 as expected since this high - latitude region is least contaminated by the galaxy ) to the value of the extragalactic background determined by the analysis of the fermi collaboration in ref .",

    "since any isotropic , smooth background is necessarily i.i.d .",
    "we expect our minimum threshold flux to be at least as large as the measured isotropic background .",
    "we do not expect the minimum threshold flux to be much larger than the isotropic background , however , because the isotropic background dominates at @xmath51 .",
    "as expected , our minimum threshold flux of roughly @xmath52 is slightly larger than the value of @xmath53 obtained by ref .",

    "the shaded region ( described in the next section ) reflects the uncertainties in the dark matter distribution . roughly , then",

    ", we will project this constraint on to the mass  cross section plane and propagate the uncertainties in the dark matter distribution to this plane . here",
    ", we note that the most stringent limit comes from the ring .",
    "while the constraint could in principle be improved by moving to smaller @xmath7 , the small number of pixels at such @xmath7 means that the bds test loses much of its statistical power .",

    "this factor of two illustrates the power of the i.i.d .",
    "analysis : the limit obtained from the mean in the ring is contaminated by flux near the galactic plane , contamination that is removed by the ring analysis introduced here .",
    "the main advantage of the ring analysis is that it makes no assumptions about the source or properties of the backgrounds to the dark matter signal .",
    "this is a significant advantage because uncertainties in backgrounds are the main limitation for constraining dark matter with observations .",
    "we have assumed only that the signal in each pixel is drawn from a distribution that is invariant under rotations around the galactic center . of course , the cost of assuming little is that the limit that can be placed using this technique is comparatively weak .",
    "for instance , since any isotropic backgrounds present in the data will also meet these assumptions , their presence will make our determined limit worse .",
    "furthermore , we note that this technique is not well suited for actually detecting dark matter , but rather should be viewed as a way of placing upper limits on the dark matter signal .",
    "the milky way is believed to exist within a roughly spherical halo of dark matter @xcite .",
    "consequently , the annihilation signal from galactic dark matter is expected to have azimuthal symmetry around the line connecting us to the galactic center .",
    "the dark matter constituting the halo is in turn thought to exist in two forms : a smooth component and a clumped component termed _ subhalos _ @xcite . almost by definition",
    ", a smooth dark matter component will have an annihilation signal for which variations from the mean are uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , the annihilation signal from smooth dark matter is a perfect candidate for the ring analysis developed in the previous section .",
    "here we ignore potential signals from annihilations occurring in subhalos , as well as a possible cosmological signal from dark matter annihilations .",
    "therefore , the constraint  on only the smooth galactic component  is conservative .    in order to turn the flux limit derived by the ring analysis into constraints on the dark matter particle properties ,",
    "we must develop a model for the expected annihilation flux from smooth galactic dark matter .",
    "the observed flux of photons due to such annihilations along a given line of sight is @xmath57 where the first factor on the right @xmath58 depends on the particle physics properties of the dark matter : mass @xmath59 , velocity - weighted annihilation cross section @xmath60 , and photon counts per annihilation @xmath61 within some desired band @xmath62 .",

    "since the uncertainty in our exclusion limit is dominated by uncertainty in the halo model , this parameter choice is therefore appropriate for our @xmath89 exclusion limit on the dark matter properties .",
    "we plot only those lines of sight with @xmath90 because this is the angular range relevant to our exclusion limit .",
    "all of the curves have been normalized so that they have the same mean as the corresponding curve for a spherical halo ; since the total amount of dark matter in the inner halo is strongly constrained ( by measurements of galactic rotation curves , for instance ) , we expect this choice of normalization to be reasonably accurate .    to proceed further , we need to know the axis ratios of the isodensity surfaces throughout the milky way halo . ref .",
    "@xcite determined values for the axis ratios of some of the isovelocity surfaces in the milky way .",

    "we adjust these distributions slightly to account for the fact that they are calculated at a distance from the galactic center , @xmath92 , given by @xmath93 ( note that @xmath92 is defined in terms of the local halo density and not the mean interior density ) while we are interested in the distributions much closer to the galactic center . using eqs . 6 and 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite we scale the axis ratios so that they correspond to a distance of @xmath94 from the galactic center , roughly the innermost distance that effects our constraint .",
    "this corresponds to decreasing @xmath95 and @xmath83 by roughly 30% and 10% respectively .",
    "the resultant distributions are roughly consistent with the results of ref .",

    "[ fig : triaxial_j ] ) and the minimum flux ( i.e. the thin curves in fig .  [ fig : triaxial_j ] ) in the ring .",
    "this difference is the amount by which we have been implicitly _ overestimating _ the i.i.d .",

    "it is clear from this figure that error introduced by assuming a spherical halo is typically no more than @xmath98 . since the uncertainty introduced into our exclusion limit by the uncertainties in @xmath73 , @xmath72 and @xmath74 is much greater than this , and since the degree of triaxiality in our own halo is not very well constrained , we choose to ignore this source of uncertainty in our exclusion plots .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning that the presence of baryons may have a non - negligible impact on the shape of the dark matter halo , particularly in the innermost region @xcite .",

    "@xcite nor ref .",
    "@xcite . while there may be a disturbance due to baryons near disk , the effect of such a disturbance on our exclusion limit is likely negligible since the limit is dominated by the region away from the disk where the backgrounds are lowest .",
    "the previous discussion has constrained @xmath54over the energy range 1to 100 .",
    "we find that our final constraint over this energy range is @xmath99 in order to turn the limits on @xmath54into constraints on the dark matter particle properties we must assume an annihilation channel for the dark matter so that @xmath100 ( eq .  [ eq : ngamma ] ) can be calculated .",

    "the choice of the energy range that we impose on our analysis can have a significant impact on the constraints that we place in the @xmath101-@xmath103 plane .",
    "for @xmath104 the annihilation photon spectrum is relatively flat compared to that of the backgrounds , so increasing @xmath105 in this regime effectively increases the size of the signal relative to the total flux , thereby improving the constraint on the dark matter properties .",
    "as @xmath106 approaches @xmath101 , the spectrum of annihilation photons falls off very quickly so increasing @xmath105 in this regime causes the constraint to become very weak .",
    "we expect , then , that the optimal constraint on the dark matter comes from choosing @xmath105 to be some fixed fraction of @xmath101 . rather than enforcing the optimal @xmath105 for each @xmath101 exactly ( which would require dividing the data into many more energy bins than the 29 that we employ ) , we allow @xmath105 to vary freely for each @xmath101 that we consider . we then choose the value of @xmath105 that maximizes our constraint on the dark matter .",
    "random fluctuations in the strength of the constraint induced by varying @xmath105 are small , so choosing @xmath105 to maximize the constraint does not decrease the statistical significance of our result .",
    "varying @xmath105 is our one minimal use of the energy information for the photons ; by making our analysis essentially independent of detailed spectral information we make our constraints more robust .",

    "since our technique places a limit on @xmath112 we expect the limit on to go roughly as @xmath113 .",

    "our limits are complementary in the sense that they are almost entirely independent of any assumptions about the diffuse background .",
    "we also find that our constraints are comparable to those obtained from an analysis of extragalactic dark matter annihilations by ref .",
    "@xcite . as evidenced in fig .  5 of that work , the constraints derived from extragalactic annihilations are subject to very large uncertainties in the magnitude of the dark matter signal .",
    "while uncertainties in the signal from smooth galactic dark matter are also important , they are not nearly as large . finally , our limits are also comparable to ( and competitive with ) those derived from an analysis of the annihilation signal from dwarf spheroidal galaxies by ref .",
    "we have developed a technique for constraining the presence of a smooth , azimuthally symmetric signal on the sky .",
    "we showed with monte carlo simulations that the technique is robust ( i.e. the limits derived from the technique are never below the mean signal flux ) . by applying the technique to data from the fermi gamma - ray space telescope we derived a constraint ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluxlim ] ) ) on the presence of any smooth signal that is symmetric with respect to rotations about the axis connecting us to the galactic center .",
    "when combined with a model for the signal due to annihilations of the smooth dark matter component in our galaxy , these limits allow us to place constraints on the dark matter particle mass and cross section . while our limits are slightly weaker than other recent results , they have the advantage of making essentially no assumptions about the backgrounds to the dark matter signal .",
    "this is a significant advantage because the uncertainties in models of backgrounds are large and often unknown .",
    "there are several ways these limits can be improved .",
    "tighter constraints on the dark matter profile would reduce the uncertainty in @xmath69 , which currently degrades the ultimate limit by more than a factor of 2 . including other sources of signal ,",
    "in particular the contribution from extra - galactic halos , would improve the signal , but in most models , this contribution is smaller than that from the galactic halo . a deeper understanding of the backgrounds could also be used in conjunction with this method to push the limits down further .",
