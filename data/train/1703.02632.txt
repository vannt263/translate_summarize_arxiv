    "<S> using the unique capabilities of the variable density turbulence tunnel at the max planck institute for dynamics and self - organization , gttingen , we report experimental result on classical grid turbulence that uncover fine , yet important details of the structure functions in the inertial range . </S>",
    "<S> this was made possible by measuring extremely long time series of up to @xmath0 samples of the turbulent fluctuating velocity , which corresponds to @xmath1 large eddy turnover times . </S>",
    "<S> these classical grid measurements were conducted in a well - controlled environment at a wide range of high reynolds numbers from @xmath2 up to @xmath3 , using both traditional hot - wire probes as well as nstap probes developed at princeton university . </S>",
    "<S> we found that deviations from ideal scaling are anchored to the small scales and that dissipation influences the inertial - range statistics at scales larger than the near - dissipation range .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the distinguishing features of turbulent flows is the deviation of its statistics from gaussian , resulting in the frequent occurrence of extreme events . despite decades of research , </S>",
    "<S> an exact prediction or description of the statistics of these extreme events based upon the governing navier - stokes equations by @xcite and @xcite is still absent . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of extreme events , such as strong wind gusts in natural turbulent flows are connected to the tails of the probability density function of the longitudinal velocity increments @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the moments of this statistical object are the longitudinal structure functions of n^th^ order @xmath5 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath6 is the longitudinal velocity component aligned with the separation @xmath7 and @xmath8 the position . </S>",
    "<S> one of the few exact results that can be derived from the navier - stokes equations under the assumptions of stationarity , homogeneity and isotropy concerns the third - order longitudinal structure function ,    @xmath9    this relation was derived originally by @xcite for correlation functions and reformulated by @xcite in terms of structure functions . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath10 is a source term containing the information about energy injection , @xmath11 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath12 the mean energy dissipation rate . in the limit of infinite reynolds numbers , @xmath13 , the second term on the left - hand side of the equation vanishes as long as the derivative remains finite . following the classical cascade picture by @xcite and the original arguments by @xcite , there is an intermediate range of scales where neither the energy injection at the large scales nor energy dissipation at small scales influence the statistics of the flow . in the inertial range , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains kolmogorov s famous four - fifths law ,    @xmath14    the variation of the third - oder structure function with the reynolds number can be seen in figure [ fig : s3 ] . with the reynolds number approaching higher values , </S>",
    "<S> an inertial range emerges and the third - order structure function appears to fullfill kolmogorov s famous four - fifths law     is the fluctuating velocity and @xmath15 the integral length scale . </S>",
    "<S> the straight black line is equal to @xmath16 , the scaling predicted by equation [ eq:45].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    further assuming self - similarity of the turbulent flow at different scales , one can generalize the result to structure functions of arbitrary orders @xmath17 , with unknown constants @xmath18 ,    @xmath19    in this framework , the scaling exponents of the structure functions @xmath20 are simply a linear function of the order . for real turbulent flows , the assumption of self - similarity does not hold and </S>",
    "<S> numerous refined models have been proposed to describe structure functions in the inertial range . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite allowed for intermittency of the energy dissipation rate following a comment by @xcite resulting in the k62 framework . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath21-model by @xcite applied concepts of fractal dimensions to turbulent flows , being refined by @xcite in the random-@xmath21-model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22-model by @xcite and @xcite allows for unequal distribution of energy in the eddy - breaking process of the energy cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23-model by @xcite proposed a @xmath24-distribution of the energy dissipation , while @xcite assumed a log - stable distribution . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite built a parameter - free model based upon a hierarchy of dissipation moments . </S>",
    "<S> this was extended by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these models have in common power - law scaling of the structure functions in the inertial range , with varying predictions for the scaling exponents as a nonlinear function of the order . assuming the validity of these predictions </S>",
    "<S> one should be able to extract scaling exponents from the data by computing logarithmic derivatives @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> a power - law behavior here would correspond to a horizontal line in a graph of @xmath26 against @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> all deviations from this line are connected to deviations from power - law behavior ( e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a graph of our data is shown in figure [ fig : s4r ] . despite the large reynolds numbers </S>",
    "<S> however , there seems to be no obvious approach to true scaling .        </S>",
    "<S> this lack of observable scaling is a common feature in experimental turbulent flows and led to an extraction method developed by @xcite called extended self - similarity ( ess ) . rather than scaling with respect to the separation @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed that structure functions scale with respect to each other , namely @xmath27 with the relative scaling exponents @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> note that different definitions of @xmath29 can influence the resulting scaling exponents @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed the experiments in the variable density turbulence tunnel ( the vdtt ) at the max planck institute for dynamics and self - organization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wind tunnel was a pressurizable closed - circuit wind tunnel , in which either air or sulfur hexafluoride ( sf@xmath30 ) circulated . by changing the pressure of the gas </S>",
    "<S> , we could adjust its kinematic viscosity , @xmath11 , and thus the reynolds number , @xmath31 , without changing the geometrical boundary conditions or the mean speed of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> we set the pressure to values between 1 and 15 bar , and so prepared viscosities between @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 .    to produce turbulence </S>",
    "<S> , we used a bi - planar grid of square grid bars of mesh spacing of 18 cm that blocked about 40% of the cross section of the tunnel . </S>",
    "<S> the mean speed , @xmath35 , of the flow was kept constant at 4.2 m/s . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the gas was stable to within 0.2k over arbitrary times and was set to fixed values between 22.0@xmath36c and 23.4@xmath36c .    </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the gas was measured at either 7.1 m or 8.3 m downstream of the grid with the nstap probes developed at princeton university @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these were micro - fabricated hot - wire probes , manufactured in two different ways such that they had either 30 or 60 micron long sensor elements . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the data acquired with the nstaps , we also acquired data with larger hot - wire probes of traditional construction produced by dantec dynamics , 0.45 or 1.25 mm long . </S>",
    "<S> the data acquired with the dantec probes are not shown in this paper , but they gave results consistent with those from the nstap and the smaller dantec probes . </S>",
    "<S> the longer datasets presented in this paper were acquired in conjunction with those shown in our paper on the decay of turbulence @xcite , but the present data are much longer as needed for the different purpose of this paper - providing sufficient statistics to uncover details of the inertial - range statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantity measured by the hot - wire probes is the velocity time series @xmath37 observed at a single position , low - pass filtered at either 30khz or 100khz , and sampled at either 60khz or 200khz , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the turbulence intensity @xmath38 of the tunnel , was between 1.6% and 3.6% of the mean speed @xmath35 , which is small enough safely to invoke taylor s hypothesis @xcite in order to convert the functions of time , @xmath37 , to functions of space , so that @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> we divide the various data into two categories , which we call datasets a and b. each dataset is comprised of measurements made at different reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> what separates the datasets is the length of the velocity records . </S>",
    "<S> dataset a consisted of 14 measurements , which were each between 6 and 9 hours long , or @xmath40 integral scales long . </S>",
    "<S> dataset b consisted of 4 measurements , which were each between 2 and 3 days long , or @xmath41 integral scales long . </S>",
    "<S> take note that the amount of data obtained in these datasets exceeds any comparable experiment by an order of magnitude , making it possible to investigate fine details in the inertial - range structure of turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the integral length scale for all flows was about 0.1 m . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , the data sets span taylor reynolds numbers between 110 and 1600 .    </S>",
    "<S> the aforementioned models considered statistics in the inertial range where , as in the classical cascade model , neither dissipation nor energy injection play a role . however , in real turbulence , there is no sharp distinctive scale between the ranges where the statistics change . </S>",
    "<S> even well above the kolmogorov length , dissipation influences the statistics , leading to the so - called near - dissipation range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a successful model describing the effects of dissipation in the near - dissipation regime @xcite has been developed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he noted that an order - dependent viscous cutoff - scale leads to deviations from scaling behavior in the near - dissipation range that grow larger as the reynolds number increases . </S>",
    "<S> there are numerous alternative models for the near - dissipation range for example by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additional detailed investigations of the transition between the dissipative range and the inertial range have been conducted by e.g. @xcite and @xcite in terms of the bottleneck effect of the energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it has been further shown that ringing in the energy spectrum also affects the transition between different ranges of structure functions and their fourier - space representations ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not discriminate between the models and chose to compare our data with meneveau s multifractal model for convenience . in the multifractal model , </S>",
    "<S> the structure functions are functions of both @xmath42 and @xmath16 ,    @xmath43    using the the predictions of the @xmath22-model by @xcite and @xcite , @xcite computes the functional form of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling exponents of the @xmath22-model are nonlinear functions of n @xcite ,    @xmath45    allowing for an order - dependent viscous cutoff scale , @xcite computes the functional form for the structure functions as    @xmath46    with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and    @xmath49    as in the original publication , we set the free parameter @xmath22 to 0.7 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 governs how unequally energy is distributed among eddies breaking during the turbulent cascade .     between 110 and 1600 . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts a single oscillation with a minimum at about @xmath50.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ fig : s4s2model ] shows ess - plots from the multifractal model . </S>",
    "<S> we present the logarithmic derivative of the fourth - order structure function by the second - order structure functions using the scaling exponent prediction of the @xmath22-model to compute the model structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> any other choice of structure functions or scaling exponent model would have given qualitatively equivalent results . </S>",
    "<S> the free turbulence parameters in this plot , @xmath51 , @xmath15 and @xmath31 are extracted from datasets a and b for 5 datasets between @xmath52 ( top ) and @xmath53 ( bottom ) . in the multifractal model </S>",
    "<S> there is a significant minimum in the near - dissipation range at around @xmath50 as a result of the order - dependent cutoff scale @xcite . for @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic derivative approaches its expected inertial - range limit of @xmath55 . within the multifractal model , </S>",
    "<S> there is strict power - law scaling in the structure functions as long as @xmath54 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath56 ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , more structural details are observable in the inertial range , being uncovered by the large amount of statistics . </S>",
    "<S> these additional oscillatory features are marked by @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it has since been a commonly accepted procedure to extract scaling exponents from ess plots by averaging over scales that are reasonably far away from the kolmogorov scale , in accordance with the multifractal predictions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the high - reynolds number , extremely long datasets from the vdtt imply the need for a more refined interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : s4s2 ] shows the logarithmic derivative of the fourth - order structure function with respect to the second - order structure function for the whole range of reynolds numbers between @xmath60 and @xmath53 in datasets a and b. in the near - dissipation range , between @xmath61 and @xmath62 the data are in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of the multifractal model as seen in [ fig : s4s2model ] . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with increasing reynolds number , the minimum in the near - dissipation range ( @xmath56 ) grows significantly in depth . at smaller scales , </S>",
    "<S> the nstap data starts to get distorted by electric noise from the cta measurement system and temporal and spatial filtering effects begin to influence the probe response . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , our experiments uncover features not reported in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> while the multifractal model predicts a monotonic approach from the near - dissipation range minimum toward the value of the ratio of the scaling exponents , the vdtt data show an overshoot ( @xmath57 ) at around @xmath63 , which is approximately independent of renyolds number . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the expectations , the data from the vdtt do not approach a constant value at higher @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , an only weakly reynolds - number dependent and persistent substructure in the inertial range becomes visible .     of the extrema in the logarithmic derivatives of figure [ fig : s4s2 ] in terms of the kolmogorov scale @xmath51 as a function of the reynolds number @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid black line is @xmath64 , predicted by our experiments . </S>",
    "<S> circles represent the location of the near - dissipation range minumum , squares the first maximum , diamonds the second minimum and triangles the second maximum . </S>",
    "<S> open symbols correspond to dataset a , filled symbols to dataset b. once the reynolds number is high enough , the features denoted by circles , squares and diamonds and triangles appear to be only weakly dependent on the reynolds number.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ fig : extrema ] shows the positions , @xmath65 , of the substructures in figure [ fig : s4s2 ] in terms of the kolmogorov scale and as function of the reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> these positions have been obtained using a windowed parabolic fit to the data up to @xmath66 , though other methods such as 4-peak gaussian fits yield comparable results . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the overshoot ( @xmath57 ) at about @xmath63 , two more extrema become apparent in figure [ fig : s4s2 ] ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) before the data succumbs to noise at larger @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> these structures in the inertial range only become visible with the long datasets from the vdtt at high reynolds number , at either lower reynolds numbers ; or significantly shorter datasets , these extrema are lost within the noise . these new inertial - range structures in the structure functions </S>",
    "<S> are associated with the bottleneck phenomenon in the energy spectrum @xcite and can be embedded in refinements of existing inertial - range models . </S>",
    "<S> the features are reminiscent of the lacunarity proposed by @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these findings have significant implications for the interpretation of the statistical behavior of turbulent flows . </S>",
    "<S> the persistent structures in the ess - plots are in contradiction with the prediction of a power - law behavior in the inertial range , and imply that there is an oscillatory component in the structure functions themselves , albeit small , as an order - dependent cutoff scale as in the multifractal model is by construction unable to include multiple overshoots . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence is that with different choices of averaging intervals the same data yield different scaling exponents . </S>",
    "<S> the non - power law behavior demands refined models of the structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> the maxima and minima we find in the inertial range are not strongly dependent on the reynolds number and are anchored to the small scales @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected behavior shows that far away from the dissipation range , far even from the near - dissipation range , dissipative effects still qualitatively affect the statistics of the flow and it implies meso - scale organization of small - scale structures . </S>",
    "<S> these findings might be associated with more complex cascade processes hinted in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear from our data how far up from the dissipation range in scale the oscillations persist . </S>",
    "<S> future investigations should measure at even higher reynolds number to achieve a higher ratio of @xmath67 and to uncover more features of the inertial - range statistics . with an active grid installed , </S>",
    "<S> the vdtt is able to achieve reynolds number significantly higher than the classic grid data presented here and will be such a further step . </S>"
