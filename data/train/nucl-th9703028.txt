    "a well known difficulty of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite is the existence ( for some interactions at least ) of abnormal solutions , corresponding to excitations in the relative time - energy degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "wick suggested that these solutions could be an artefact due to the ladder approximation , and would disappear if the higher - order irreducible graphs could be included @xcite .",
    "mugibayashi showed however that the abnormal solutions remain present in the exact static model @xcite , which is simple enough to be completely solved .",
    "recently , the conclusions of mugibayashi were questioned by jallouli and sazdjian @xcite , so that the road to wick s interpretation is open again .",
    "this possible conspiration of the higher - order contributions for suppressing the abnormal solutions reminds us a similar cancellation of the higher - order terms at the one - body ( or one large mass ) limit of some 3d reductions of the bethe - salpeter equation , leaving only a simple dirac or klein - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "a way of relating these two facts can be found in our previous study of a zero - d reduction of the 1d bethe - salpeter equation for the static model at the ladder approximation @xcite .",
    "we showed that the reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation does not in general kill the possible abnormal solutions . despite the elimination of the relative time ,",
    "they are recovered via the multiplicity of solutions due to the complicated dependence of the final potential on the total energy .",
    "this was the starting point of the present work .",
    "it can be easily verified that this dependence of the reduced equation potential on the total energy is a necessary condition to the presence of abnormal solutions of any reduction of a bethe - salpeter equation . as this dependence disappears from some",
    "well chosen 3d reductions of the exact bethe - salpeter equation at the one - body limit ( and also from the zero - d reduction of the exact static model obtained by letting the mass of the lighter particle go also to infinity ) , the 3d equations have no abnormal solution at this limit .",
    "conversely , these abnormal solutions are present in the reduction of the static model bethe - salpeter equation at the ladder approximation , and we do not see why they would not be a fortiori present in the case of finite masses .    does the absence of abnormal solutions for a 3d reduction imply their absence for the original bethe - salpeter equation itself ?",
    "we shall show that the existence of a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation for a given total energy implies in general the existence of a solution of the reduced equation for this same total energy ( there could be convergence problems , in principle manageable by analytic extensions ) .",
    "however , the reduction being based on a constraint fixing the value of the relative energy , a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation will not lead to a corresponding solution of the reduced equation if it happens to vanish for this value .",
    "this accident does clearly not happen with the normal solutions of the exact bethe - salpeter equation , and , from the study of the static model , we can deduce that it does not happen with at least some of the abnormal solutions of the ladder approximated bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "for the possible abnormal solutions of the exact bethe - salpeter equation , we have of course no example to examine ( as we are just trying to demonstrate that such solutions do not exist ! ) .",
    "we can only conclude that these solutions , if they exist and survive at the one - body limit , are not transmitted to the 3d reductions we use .    in section 2 , we present our 3d reduction of the exact or ladder approximated bethe - salpeter equation for two fermions , the existence condition for this reduction and how to invert it . in section 3",
    ", we compute the one - body limit of this reduction in the qed case , the one - body limit of the bethe - salpeter equation itself and verify that the reduction of the limit is the limit of the reduction . in section 4 , we get the static model by letting the mass of the former light fermion become also infinite , and compare again the zero - d reduction of the zero - body limit with the limit of the reduction .",
    "we also verify that the existence condition for the reduction is satisfied at least by the solutions of the ladder approximated bethe - salpeter equation for the static model . in section  5",
    ", we consider the bethe - salpeter equation and its 3d reduction for equal masses , and get the static model directly by letting this common mass go to infinity .",
    "this leads to the same bethe - salpeter equation as in the preceding section , but to another zero - d reduction , based on a different choice of the fixed relative energy .",
    "section 6 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we shall write the bethe - salpeter equation for the bound states of two fermions as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the bethe - salpeter amplitude , function of the positions @xmath2 or of the momenta @xmath3 of the fermions , according to the representation chosen .",
    "the operator @xmath4 is the bethe - salpeter kernel , given in a non - local momentum representation by the sum of the irreducible two - fermion feynman graphs .",
    "the operator @xmath5 is the free propagator , given by the product @xmath6 of the two individual fermion propagators : @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are the dirac free hamiltonians @xmath9 the bethe - salpeter kernel @xmath10 should contain charge renormalization and vacuum polarization graphs , while the propagators @xmath11 should contain self - energy terms ( which can be transferred to @xmath12 @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we consider only the free fermion propagators in @xmath13 and the `` skeleton '' graphs in @xmath14 , and we hope that the inclusion of the various corrections would not change our conclusions",
    ". we shall define the total ( or external , cm , global ) and relative ( or internal ) variables : @xmath15 @xmath16 and give a name to the corresponding combinations of the free hamiltonians : @xmath17 in order to keep our formula s compact , we do not write the arguments of the functions and operators . when needed , we work in the momentum representation ( most often , we indicate only the relative energy explicitly ) .      the free propagator @xmath5 will be approached by a carefully chosen expression @xmath18 , combining a constraint fixing the relative energy , and a global 3d propagator .",
    "the argument of the constraint and the inverse of the propagator should be combinations of the operators used in the free equations ( at last approximately and for the positive - energy solutions ) .",
    "we shall choose breit s propagator @xcite @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xmath21 we shall write the free propagator as the 3d approached propagator , plus a rest : @xmath22 the bethe - salpeter equation becomes then the inhomogeneous equation @xmath23 with @xmath24 solving ( formally ) the inhomogeneous equation ( [ 2.26 ] ) and putting the result into ( [ 2.27 ] ) , we get @xmath25 where @xmath26 obeys @xmath27 the reduction series ( [ 2.29 ] ) re - introduces in fact the reducible graphs into the bethe - salpeter kernel , but with @xmath5 replaced by @xmath28 . equation ( [ 2.28 ] ) is a 3d equivalent of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "it depends on the choice of @xmath18 and is not manifestly covariant ( of course , we can always write it in the center of mass frame ( assuming @xmath29 ) and then replace everything by its covariant equivalent )",
    ". we can write it as a pair of coupled equations by multiplying it by @xmath30 and @xmath31 : @xmath32 @xmath33 the relative time can be completely eliminated by making @xmath34 which gives @xmath35 @xmath36 the @xmath37 spectrum of ( [ 2.34 ] ) should be that of the original bethe - salpeter equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) , without the possible states for which the expression used in ( [ 2.27 ] ) to define the wave function @xmath38 vanishes . the normal bound state spectrum , connected to the nonrelativistic spectrum , will be obtained at first order by keeping only the first term @xmath39 ( or an approximation of it ) in @xmath40 the remaining of @xmath41 being treated as a perturbation .",
    "if the bethe - salpeter equation has also an abnormal spectrum , it should , at least implicitly , remain present also in the 3d reduction ( [ 2.34 ] ) , via the @xmath42dependence of @xmath43 writing @xmath44\\psi'\\label{2.36}\\ ] ] and diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath45\\psi'_i(p_0)\\,=\\,e_i(p_0)\\psi'_i(p_0)\\label{2.37}\\ ] ] we get the energy spectrum as the set of the roots of the equations @xmath46 for each value of @xmath47 we should find the energy of the normal solution , plus possibly a set of abnormal energies .",
    "this scheme is in general too complicated to be used in actual numerical calculations .",
    "we know three exceptions :     when we want only to compute the normal solutions by perturbations .",
    " in the static model for two fermions in qed at the ladder approximation ( one photon exchange ) @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath48 is not an operator anymore , it is simply a function of the energy and the coupling constant .",
    "the reduced equation ( a simple numerical equation ) gives the only normal solution and the even abnormal solutions ( for the odd abnormal solutions , @xmath49 vanishes , as the relative energy is fixed to zero in the reduction performed in @xcite )",
    ". the unique function @xmath50 is divided into sectors separated by poles and containing each one solution .",
    "the reduction series converges only in the first sector containing the normal solution , but can be analytically extended by using the pad approximants method .",
    " at the one - body or zero - body limits of the exact equation , since the final 3d potential reduces then to a simple compact term , as we shall see in section 3 .",
    "the 3d reduction performed above becomes impossible when the 3d wave function @xmath51 defined by ( [ 2.27 ] ) , is the null function .",
    "this gives the condition @xmath52 or , using the bethe - salpeter equation itself : @xmath53 the expression @xmath54 when projected on the subspaces @xmath55 becomes a product of factors which can not vanish in the usual range of the bound states @xmath56 the reduction condition becomes thus simply @xmath57 the solutions @xmath58 of the bethe - salpeter equation for which @xmath59 will thus not lead to solutions of the 3d equation .",
    "this would be the case for the solutions antisymmetrical in @xmath60 which may appear when the masses are equal .",
    "we have of course the possibility of performing a reduction based on a different constraint , like putting a fermion on the mass shell , as gross @xcite .",
    "the bethe - salpeter amplitude is given in terms of the wave function by @xmath61 at @xmath62 we can factorize an operator @xmath63 out of @xmath64 the 3d potential @xmath65 out of @xmath66 and use the 3d equation ( [ 2.34 ] ) to recover the relation ( [ 2.38 ] ) .      to be definite",

    "the external lines are there only to indicate the initial momenta @xmath71 and the final momenta @xmath72 of the fermions 1 and 2 .",
    "the internal momenta of fermion 1 are @xmath73 and the momenta of the photons leaving the fermion 1 line are @xmath74 all momenta will be written in terms of the fixed external momenta and of @xmath75 which we choose as integration variables . with these conventions , the different graphs of a given order differ only by the insertion points of the photon lines on the fermion 2 line .",
    "the internal momenta of fermion 2 will vary accordingly , and we shall denote them by @xmath76 with a supplementary index identifying the corresponding graph .",
    "the momenta of the intermediate fermion lines are thus : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79",
    "we shall now take the one - body limit @xmath80 of the 3d equation in qed .",
    "we shall first define e as a finite part of @xmath81 : @xmath82 for @xmath83 , we have , in any part of ( [ 2.41 ] ) : @xmath84 this is also the asymptotic form to give to @xmath85 and @xmath86 in ( [ 2.41 ] ) , because of the constraint . combining this result with ( [ 3.1 ] ) , we get @xmath87 for the intermediate energies , we shall define more practical variables . considering , to be definite , the @xmath88 diagrams , we have @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 in the ladder diagram ( figure 1 ) : @xmath93 @xmath94 for the 4!-1 other diagrams of order @xmath88 , we have simply to permute @xmath95 in ( [ 3.10 ] ) .",

    "it can be shown that similar cancellations occur at each order @xcite , so that we remain with the first term of @xmath65 ( a coulomb potential ) only .",
    "this result can also be obtained in other gauges .",
    "equation ( [ 2.37a ] ) has then only one root , corresponding to the normal solution . at the ladder aproximation ,",
    "however , we have only the terms in @xmath106 with nothing to cancel them . equation ( [ 2.37a ] ) can then have several roots .",

    "what we have shown in this work is that the higher - order contributions to the 3d potential of well chosen reduced equations for the exact model cancel mutually at leading order in each of the masses .",
    "the dependence on the total energy , which is related to the presence of abnormal solutions , is thus much less important than at the ladder approximation , and possibly too small to allow for more than one root of @xmath221 it could perhaps be possible to eliminate this dependence completely order by order , using the large freedom which we still have in the choice of the 3d reduction .",
    "we made clear anyway that , although the non - ladder contributions can be treated as correction terms in the study of the normal solutions , they modify completely ( if not annihilate ) the abnormal solutions obtained at the ladder approximation .",
    "the detection and computation of abnormal solutions goes thus beyond the validity of the ladder approximation .",
