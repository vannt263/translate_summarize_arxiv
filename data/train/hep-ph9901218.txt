    "penguin diagrams play an important role in charmless @xmath1 decays and direct @xmath0 violation .",
    "they can provide not only the necessary different loop effects of internal u and c quarks@xcite , but also dominate the branching ratios of many modes of charmless @xmath1 decays , such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "as we know , the standard theoretical framework of studying non - leptonic @xmath1 decays is based on the effective hamilton approach and the factorization approximation .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is expressed by a sum of the products of a series of wilson coefficients and four - quark operators .",
    "unfortunately , we have many difficulties in calculating matrix elements of the four - quark operators directly in exclusive non - leptonic @xmath1 decays , such as @xmath1 to two pseudoscalar meson processes .",
    "so we have to use the factorization assumption , usually the @xmath7 model@xcite",
    ". then the mesonic matrix elements are factorized into the product of two matrix elements of single currents , governed by decay constants and form factors .",
    "however in the @xmath7 model , the factorization involves the contributions of fiertz transformations of the four - quark operators . using the fiertz rearrangement , one can find that the current - current product @xmath2 matrix elements should be taken into account .",
    "the general method to deal with @xmath2 matrix elements is to transform them into @xmath8 matrix elements by using equation of motion",
    ". then one can find that @xmath2 matrix elements are very sensitive to the masses of light quarks .",
    "but the current masses of light quarks are not determined precisely .",
    "obviously , it brings large uncertainty for estimating the @xmath2 matrix elements and the branching ratios of charmless @xmath1 decays . as pointed by a. ali , g. kramer and c.d .",
    "l@xcite , varying the light quarks masses by @xmath9 yields variation of up to @xmath10 in some selected decay modes(such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ) in this work , instead of using equation of motion we will try to apply the @xmath3 method to recalculate the ratio of the @xmath2 to ( v - a)(v - a ) matrix elements at leading twist approximation , which is not sensitive to the masses of light quarks .",
    "we think that it might have less uncertainties than the results obtained by using the quark equation of motion .",
    "so , it is necessary to recalculate the branching ratios for b meson charmless decays by using @xmath3 method and compare with those by using equation of motion . on the other hand , nonfactorizable effects in charmless @xmath1",
    "decays can not be neglected . to compensate it for this ,",
    "the general approach is to replace the number of corlors @xmath13 by a phenomenological color parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we will discuss the differences while @xmath14 equal 2 , 3 , @xmath15 respectly .",
    "this work is organized as follows : section 2 gives the framework of calculation including the effective hamiltonian and fatorization approximation .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the @xmath3 method to estimate the ratio of the @xmath2 to @xmath8 matrix elements . in section 4",
    ", we calculate the branching ratios of charmless @xmath1 decays into two pseudoscalar mesons and their @xmath0 asymmetries using the method mentioned above .",
    "we also give some discussions of the numerical results .",
    "section 5 is for the concluding remarks .",
    "the @xmath16 effective hamiltionian is @xmath17+h.c.,\\ ] ] where @xmath18(for @xmath19 transition ) or @xmath20(for @xmath21 transition ) and @xmath22 are wilson coefficients which have been evaluated to next - to - leading order approximation . in the eq.(1 ) , the four - quark operators @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the tree operators , @xmath27 the @xmath28 penguin operators and @xmath29 the electroweak penguin operators . with the renormalization group method , we can evolove the renormalization scheme independent wilson coefficients @xmath30 from the scale @xmath31 to @xmath32 , which are@xcite @xmath33 so we can express the physical amplitude as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 denote the tree level matrix elements and @xmath36    @xmath37    as noted in the introduction , we have to calculate the matrix elements of the four - quark operators by using the factorization assumption . here",
    "we apply the @xmath7 model@xcite",
    ". however , nonfactorizable effects are not negligible in the process of @xmath1 to two light mesons .",
    "we will use the simpliest approach to compensate it by using only one color parameter @xmath14 , even if there is no reason why using only one single parameter @xmath14 to explain the branching ratios of all kind of different modes .    for illustration , we give the amplitude of @xmath38 as an example : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "+ we will use the following parameterization for decay constants and form factors :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , and we use the monopole dominance assumption for the @xmath44 dependence of the form factors : @xmath45 then we can obtain @xmath46\\ ] ] @xmath47 where eq.(13 ) is derived from the equation of motion and @xmath48 presents the mass of the light quark @xmath49 respectly(@xmath50 ) .",
    "calculation in this framework have been discussed in detail in some papers @xcite involving the branching ratios and cp asymmetries in non - leptonic charmless 2-body b decays . in these papers",
    "the uncertainties resulting from the renormalization scale dependence , non - factorizable contributions and the input parameters ( @xmath51 , quark masses and form factors ) have been worked out .",
    "further penguin effects and the strong sensitivity of the cp asymmetries to the ckm parameters ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) have been discussed there . in these uncertainties , the uncertainty of light quark masses",
    "is mainly showed in the part of @xmath2 matrix elements .",
    "sometimes they are dominant terms in some modes of charmless @xmath1 decays , such as @xmath38 , in which the term @xmath54 is enhanced by the factor @xmath55 .",
    "then it motivates us to give a new estimation of the matrix elements @xmath56 to cancel the uncertainty of the light quark masses .",
    "brodsky _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has pointed out that the factorization formula of @xmath3 can be applied to the exclusive @xmath1 decays into light mesons for the large momentum transfers .",
    "one can write the amplitude as a convolution of a hard - scattering quark - gluon amplitudes @xmath57 which describe the fractional longitudinal momentum distribution of the quark and antiquark in each meson",
    ". an important feature of this formalism is that , at high momentum transfer , long - range final state interactions between the outgoing hardrons can be neglected . in the case of non - leptonic",
    "weak decays the mass squared of the heavy meson @xmath58 establishes the relevant momentum scale @xmath59 , so that for a sufficiently massive initial state the decay amplitude is of the order of @xmath60 , even without including loop corrections to the weak hamiltonian .",
    "the dominant contribution is controlled by single gluon exchange .",
    "we intend to apply @xmath3 method to estimate those hadronic matrix elements such as @xmath8 and @xmath2 at the leading twist approximation .",
    "the wave function of @xmath1 meson and flavor @xmath61 singlet or octet pseudoscalar mesons are taken as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an identity in color space . in @xmath28 , the integration of the distribution amplitude",
    "is related to the meson decay constant @xmath64 then we can write down the amplitude of fig.1 as @xmath65 = f_p q_{\\mu}~,\\nonumber\\\\ \\langle p \\vert \\bar { q}_1 \\gamma_5 q_2 \\vert 0\\rangle ~_{pqcd } & = & 3\\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\int dy\\phi_p ( y ) tr \\left[\\gamma_5~(\\slash{\\hskip -2mm}q + m_p ) \\gamma_5 \\right]=f_p m_p~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a consistent way , we can use perturbative qcd to estimate the matrix elements like @xmath66 and @xmath67(fig.2 , fig.3 ) , where @xmath68 denotes light quark field operator and we have neglected the fermi motion of quarks , while the gluons in the fig.2,3 are hard because @xmath69 ( here we using mean values @xmath70 , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) so , we can neglect the @xmath73 term and use perturbative qcd method to calculate the amplitude .",

    ". one can find their results are sensitive to the values of parameters @xmath76 and @xmath88 , and seem small compared with the @xmath7 result .",
    "we also compute the matrix element @xmath89 and list the numerical results in table 1 . where we take @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we can see that the results are very sensitive to the values of parameter @xmath76 and @xmath88 , and smaller than the bsw result which is about @xmath93 @xcite . as mentioned in the ref.@xcite ,",
    "the pqcd results are comparatively small in many cases .",
    "but the ratio @xmath94 is insensitive to the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath88 .",
    "so it is more reliable because of cancelation of the main uncertainties .",
    "we list our computation in the table 2 .",
    "the ratio by using equation of motion is @xmath95 and it is about one order of magnitude larger than the pqcd estimation . as mentioned in our introduction , the matrix elements of @xmath2 four quarks operator are very important in some decay modes of @xmath1 mesons , like @xmath1 to @xmath96 and other mesons .",
    "so it is necessary to recalculate the branching ratios and @xmath0 asymmetries for 2-body charmless @xmath1 decays by using the pqcd method instead of the equation of motion .",
    "in the @xmath1 rest frame , the two body decay width is @xmath97 where @xmath98^{\\frac { 1}{2 } } } { 2m_b}\\ ] ] is the magnitude of the momentum of the particle @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "the corresponding branching ratio is given by @xmath101    the direct @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath102 for @xmath1 meson decays into @xmath103 is defined as @xmath104    in our numerical calculation , we use the wolfstein parameterization for the @xmath105 matrix @xmath106+{\\cal{o}}(\\lambda^4)\\ ] ] and we take@xcite @xmath107 otherwise we take all parameters such as meson decay constants and form factors needed in our calculation as follows@xcite : @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 . here",
    "we apply the flavor wave functions of @xmath122 and @xmath53 as@xcite @xmath123    we give the numerical results of the branching ratios and @xmath0 asymmetries for @xmath1 charmless decays in table 3,4,5 . as a comparison ,",
    "the results by using the equation of motion are also listed in the tables where we take @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in the calculation , we have neglected the contributions of w - annihilation , w - exchange and space - like penguin diagrams .    from the tables , we can see the following features :    \\(i ) for most of charmless b decays , the contributions of penguin diagrams are important .",
    "\\(ii ) comparing the results of the pqcd method with those by using equation of motion , one can find large difference between them . in the modes of @xmath4 and @xmath128 , the branching ratios predicted by using equation of motion is larger than those of the pqcd method by about a factor 2 .",
    "while final state involving @xmath122 , the factor would be more large . obviously , @xmath0 asymmetries are also affected by these difference . in our computation , we find that the ratio of @xmath56 to @xmath129 predicted by pqcd method is not of @xmath130 dependence like the estimation by use of equation of motion .",
    "so while @xmath131 is large , the distinguishes between two method are more obvious .",
    "( iii)in many decay modes , the branching ratios are sensitive to the color parameter @xmath14 , such as @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "otherwise , the value of @xmath14 affects @xmath0 asymmetries more largely than branching ratios in some modes , for example , @xmath135 , which @xmath0 asymmetry rangs from @xmath136 to @xmath137 for @xmath14 ranging form @xmath138 to @xmath15 .",
    "it is because that @xmath139 are sensitive to @xmath14 which gives the different strong phases .",
    "( iv)our results are smaller than those in some literatures@xcite . in some decay modes like @xmath140 ,",
    "our results are one order of magnitude smaller than the results of the experiments@xcite . because we did not consider the contributions of other mechanisms , such as @xmath141 via @xmath28 anormaly@xcite , @xmath142@xcite @xmath143 . in the ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors gave the numerical results involved the contributions of the new mechanisms , which fit the experiments very well .",
    "in this paper , we recalculate the decays of @xmath1 to two charmless pseudoscalar mesons with conventional method ( the standard effective weak hamiltonian and the @xmath7 model ) . instead of using equations of motion , we use an alternative method to estimate the hadronic matrix elements @xmath2 and obtain comparatively smaller results . in some modes , which are penguin dominant , such as @xmath4 , the branching ratios that we predicted seem to be a little bit smaller than the lower limits of the experiments of @xmath144@xcite . but",
    "they are derived in the factorization approach , many mechanisms are not considered in this work such as final state interactions . especially in the modes of @xmath4 or @xmath145 , fsi could yield dominant contribution to the decay width@xcite .",
