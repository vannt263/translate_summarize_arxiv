    "akari is the first japanese satellite dedicated to infrared astronomy ( murakami et al .",
    "it was successfully launched on february 21st in 2006 ( ut ) from the uchinoura space center ( usc ) with the m - v rocket of japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) .",
    "akari opened its aperture lid to begin astronomical observation on april 13th 2006 .",
    "akari achieved continuous observation during 550  days by the time when the liquid - helium ran out on august 26th 2007 .",
    "akari was thrown in a sun - synchronous polar orbit along the twilight zone at an altitude of @xmath1700  km in order to carry out the all - sky survey in every half - year .",
    "the telescope has the size of 68.5  cm in diameter ( kaneda et al .",
    "2007 ) , and is cooled down at lower than 6  k in a liquid - helium cryostat ( nakagawa et al .",
    "2007 ) for reduction of thermal emission from the instruments .",
    "the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) is one of the two focal - plane instruments onboard akari ( kawada et al .",
    "it has four photometric bands between 50180  @xmath0 , with two types of ge : ga array devices ; the short - wavelength ( sw ) detector and the long - wavelength ( lw ) detector . the sw detector ( fujiwara et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is responsible for the wavelength range in 50110  @xmath0 , is a two - dimensional monolithic ge : ga photoconductor array .",
    "this array is directly connected to a cryogenic readout electronics ( cre ) by indium - bumping technology .",
    "this detector was developed under collaboration among the national institute of information and communications technology ( nict ) , institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) of japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) , and nagoya university .",
    "on the other hand , the lw detector ( doi et al . 2002 ) for 110180  @xmath0 is a compact stressed ge : ga photoconductor array having a special cavity structure and a stressing mechanism .",
    "ge : ga chips for the lw detector were supplied by nict , and the lw detector module was assembled by the university of tokyo . as for the cres of the sw and lw detectors , we developed a capacitive trans - impedance amplifier ( ctia ) with silicon p - mosfets optimized for low - temperature operation ( nagata et al .",
    "fis was designed primarily to perform the all - sky survey , which is the main purpose of the akari mission . additionally , fis has two other operation modes with pointing attitude control ; the slow - scan mode to take detailed images of specific targets and the spectroscopy mode to take spectra by using the fourier transform spectrometer ( kawada et al .",
    "2008 ; murakami et al .",
    "2009 , in prep . ) .",
    "the sensitivity in the slow - scan mode is 12 orders of magnitude better than that of the all - sky survey , because the exposure time on a target source is longer than the all - sky survey mode . in this paper",
    ", we describe the data reduction procedures and the in - orbit performance of the slow - scan mode , the imaging performance , and the flux calibration .",
    "characterization and calibration of fis were performed by observing two kinds of well - established photometric calibration standards .",
    "one of them are solar - system objects such as asteroids and planets , and the others are stars .",
    "these calibration sources were studied well enough ( asteroids ; m@xmath3ller & lagerros 1998 , 2002 , stars ; cohen et al . 1999 , 2003a , 2003b ) , and were used as the calibration standard in the previous infrared missions ( e.g. , iso / isocam ; blommaert et al .",

    "2007 , stansberry et al . 2007 ) .",
    "some of the galaxies observed by iso and iras were also examined not only for the cross calibration but also for the calibration check for the objects with much redder spectra than stars and asteroids .    in sec .  2",
    ", we explain the method of the fis slow - scan observation .",
    "we describe observations of the calibration standards in sec .  3 .",
    "careful data reduction procedures are required in order to obtain high - quality images and to establish the accurate calibration .",
    "accordingly , we describe the process of data reduction in sec .",
    "the imaging performance is discussed in sec .",
    "5 . in sec .",
    "6 , we describe the calibration factors , and their flux dependency by considering the characteristics of the ge : ga detectors",
    ". we also checked the consistency of the calibration for various observations .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "the calibration factors derived by the present work are the official values of akari / fis slow - scan calibration .",
    "the fis has four photometric bands whose center wavelengths are represented at 65 , 90 , 140 , and 160  @xmath0 .",
    "these band shapes , shown in fig .  [ fig : rsrf ] , are formed by the combination of optical filters and two detector devices .",
    "each detector device covers one broad - band and one narrow - band ; _ wide - s _ ( 90  @xmath0 ) and _ n60 _ ( 65  @xmath0 ) for the sw detector and _ wide - l _ ( 140  @xmath0 ) and _ n160 _ ( 160  @xmath0 ) for the lw detector .",
    "the array formats are 3@xmath420 , 2@xmath420 , 3@xmath415 , and 2@xmath415 for the _ wide - s _ , _ n60 _ , _ wide - l _ , and _",
    "n160 _ bands , respectively .",
    "the pixel scales are 26.8  arcsec for the sw detector and 44.2  arcsec for the lw detector , whose values are comparable to the diffraction limits of the telescope .",
    "the field - of - views ( fovs ) of two detector devices overlap on the sky .",
    "the specifications for the fis instrument are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : fis ] .    as reported by many authors , ge : ga detectors",
    "show slow transient response at low temperature under low background flux conditions , i.e. , in the space environment ( kaneda et al .",
    "2002 , hiromoto & fujiwara 1999 , haegel et al . 1999 , fouks & schubert 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "this slow transient response indicates time - delay in response for quick changes of the incoming flux .",
    "the time constant of the slow response is typically 10100  seconds , and it depends on both the background and the signal photon fluxes . therefore , in the case of akari which conduct the scan observations , the slow response causes decrease of the sensitivity for compact sources . in order to reduce the effects of the slow response of the lw detector ,",
    "an offset light source is placed in front of the lw detector unit to irradiate each detector pixels with a constant intensity .",
    "the intensity of this offset light source was set to be @xmath1100  @xmath5 to obtain the highest signal - to - noise ratio taking the increase of the photon noise into account .",
    "the fis slow - scan observations are carried out using the akari astronomical observation templates ( aots ) fis01 and fis02 .",
    "fis01 is designed for compact source photometry with two sets of round - trip scans , while fis02 is suitable for wide area mapping with a long single round - trip scan .",
    "observers can select the scan speed (  s@xmath6 or  s@xmath6 ) and the reset interval ( 0.5  sec , 1.0  sec , or 2.0  sec ) . in case of fis01 , the cross - scan shift length between two round trips is also selectable from either a few pixels ( ) or half of the fov ( ) .",
    "more details about the aots are described in kawada et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and verdugo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "one set of the slow - scan observation takes about 30  minutes , including the calibration sequence .",
    "the dark current measurement and responsivity check with an internal calibrator are executed by closing the cold shutter during 7  minutes of the attitude maneuver operation between the all - sky survey position and the target position of the pointing observation .",
    "after the maneuver completes , the shutter is opened for monitoring the sky signal during the settling time for fine control of the satellite attitude , and then the slow - scan starts . at the turning point(s ) of the round - trip scan(s ) , the shutter is briefly closed and the internal calibration lamps are turned on to monitor the time variation of the detector responsivity .",
    "the total observation time for the round - trip scan(s ) is about 12  minutes .",
    "the same calibration sequence is repeated during the maneuver for returning to the all - sky survey mode after the pointing observation .",
    "such a highly - redundant calibration data set enabled us to correct the response changes of the detectors , referring to astronomical calibration data taken by separate observations with the same calibration sequence .",
    "for evaluation of the imaging performance and flux calibration , several kinds of astronomical point - like sources were observed ; 18  slow - scan observations of 14  stars , 17  slow - scan observations of 11  asteroids , 2  slow - scan observations of a planet ( neptune ) , and 13  slow - scan observations of 11  galaxies .",
    "all observations were carried out by the fis01 ( two round - trip scans ) mode with a shift .",
    "the scan speed was  @xmath7 for most cases to obtain a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a few observations were performed with the  @xmath7 scan in order to check the influence caused by the differences of the scan speed .",
    "the reset interval was chosen so as to avoid saturation for each target .",
    "the calibration stars were selected from the standard star catalog for spectral types of @xmath8 and @xmath9 established by m. cohen et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "these stars have been studied extensively and are reliable as the calibration standards with the accuracies better than 6% .",
    "unfortunately , the stars are too faint to use as calibrators for the _ wide - l _ and _ n160 _ bands .",
    "since asteroids are brighter than stars , they are widely used as the far - infrared calibrators ( m@xmath3ller & lagerros 2003 ) .",
    "we used them for the _ n60 _ and _ wide - s _ bands and also for the _ wide - l _ and _ n160 _ bands .",
    "asteroids show flux variations on various levels and time scales due to the change of illumination , observing geometries , and also their rotation .",
    "therefore , we estimated the expected flux for each observation from the thermophysical model ( tpm ) ( m@xmath3ller & lagerros 1998 , 2002 ) by taking the geometries and surface properties into account .",
    "the flux uncertainties ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : obslog ] ) are based on a thorough analysis of the tpm input parameters and the number and quality of well - calibrated thermal observations for each asteroid .",
    "the apparent motions of the asteroids are typically less than  @xmath10 , and are taken into account at image co - addition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) .",
    "we also observed several point - like galaxies ( luminous infrared galaxies ) whose fluxes have been well studied by iras and iso .",
    "we used bright samples for the measurement of the point spread functions ( psfs ) and the encircled energy functions , especially for the _ n160 _ band .",
    "table  [ tab : obslog ] summarizes the observation log and the expected fluxes with their uncertainties . in all the four bands , the expected fluxes range from @xmath1100  mjy to @xmath1100  jy , i.e. , more than three orders of magnitudes .",
    "note that the expected fluxes listed here are color - corrected values by assuming the flat spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath11  const . ) .",
    "all observations had been carried out in the performance verification ( pv ) phase and in the engineering time available for calibration which is occasionally allocated according to the requirement .",
    "the raw data were processed using the official fis slow - scan data - analysis toolkit ( ss - tool ) to produce the time - series calibrated data and the final co - added map .",
    "more details about the standard reduction steps are described in matsuura et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "first of all , the raw data were processed by the software tools to do adu - to - volt conversion , flagging of bad data ( dead pixels , saturated pixels , reset anomalies , and other discontinuities ) and the correction of non - linear integration ramps .",
    "the next process is slope calculation of each ramp , removing the cosmic - ray events identified in the ramp .",
    "this process maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio and avoids any periodic structure arising from incompleteness of the non - linear ramp correction .",
    "the reduced data provides 110  samples per pixel for a source crossing time , which depend on both the scan speed and the reset interval . by co - adding the data of all array pixels , the nyquist sampling condition is satisfied in the real - space domain .",
    "glitches and subsequent tails induced by cosmic - ray hits affect the data severely ( suzuki et al .",
    "the integration ramps affected by the glitches were eliminated in the slope calculation process .",
    "the tails were not flagged - out at this stage , but the affected data were removed by sigma clipping in the co - addition process .    the third step of the ss - tool processing is to produce calibrated data for each array pixel after dark current subtraction and flat - fielding .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel variations of the detector responsivity are approximately 15% and 50% of the average for the sw detector and the lw detector , respectively .",
    "therefore , the correction of the responsivity variation is necessary to obtain accurate images .",
    "this process is based on the fis observations of known diffuse sources : zodiacal emissions and interstellar dust emissions , which are expected to be smooth within the field of view . in this process",
    "we can also compare the sky brightness measured by the fis with dirbe / cobe , which provide a well calibrated far - infrared sky map ( matsuura et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "accordingly , the unit conversion from the instrumental unit to the surface brightness is simultaneously performed .",
    "the zodiacal emission is expected to be almost perfectly flat ; their anisotropies on arcminute scales are less than 1% ( abraham et al . 1997 ) . in the cases of the _ n60 _ and _ wide - s _ bands ,",
    "the sky brightness of almost entire sky except for the galactic plane regions is dominated by the zodiacal emission , and the contributions of galactic cirrus ( interstellar dust ) emission are expected to be negligible .",
    "hence , the blank sky observed near the target source can be used for flat - fielding , as long as there is no bright source in there .",
    "the response distribution of the detector array pixels is derived from the average of time - series data during the slow - scan , where the average is calculated after removing data that exceed the 3-@xmath12 noise level for each pixel .",
    "the flat is built based on sky monitoring data acquired during the attitude - settling time just before the slow - scan observation .",
    "the flat - fielding is done by dividing the data by the response distribution . with this self flat - fielding method ,",
    "any stripes in the image caused by the flat field errors are buried under the random noise .    in the cases of the _ wide - l _ and _ n160 _ bands ,",
    "the detector signals are dominated by offset light implemented to improve the slow transient response of the stressed ge : ga .",
    "although galactic cirrus emissions at high latitudes could be a flat source with moderate smoothness ( @xmath110% ) and relatively high brightness , their signals are less than 10% of that of the offset light .",
    "the intensity distributions of the offset light at the aperture of the detector arrays are estimated from laboratory measurements to be uniform to within 10% .",
    "hence , the self flat - fielding method with an average sky signal including offset light was applied to correct the responsivity variation in the detector arrays , as was done for the _ n60 _ and _ wide - s _ bands .",
    "the final step of the ss - tool processing is co - addition of the calibrated time - series data onto a sky grid .",
    "the sky position of each data point is derived from the telescope boresight according to the satellite attitude and from the array pixel map on the focal - plane .",
    "the grid pixel sizes were set to .",
    "a sufficient number of data point per grid pixel ( @xmath135 on average ) is secured by considering the finite size of the detector array pixel ( drizzle method ; williams et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the co - adding process",
    ", small glitches and other artifacts were sigma - clipped with the standard deviation calculated at each grid pixel .",
    "the threshold for the sigma - clipping was set to 5-times the standard deviation .",
    "the fraction of the rejected data points in this process was less than 1% of the original data .",
    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows an example of the final co - added images ( asteroid ceres ) for all the fis bands .",
    "the imaging performance and flux calibration based on the obtained maps are discussed in the following section .",
    "before the launch of akari , we checked the psfs in the laboratory using a pin - hole source located on the focal - plane of the fis optics ( shirahata et al .",
    "the measured psfs were almost consistent with those expected from the optical simulation , though the uncertainty originated in the measurement system was somewhat large .",
    "the psfs , throughout the optics including the akari telescope , were evaluated in orbit by observations of bright point - sources .",
    "these sources are chosen with the condition that s / n for single pointing observation is better than 300 , which are designated in tab .",
    "[ tab : obslog ] by the bold - faced type or the circle symbols ; 19 sources brighter than 10  jy for the _ n60 _ band , 28 sources brighter than 2  jy for the _ wide - s _ band , 6 sources brighter than 20  jy for the _ wide - l _ band , and 4 sources brighter than 50  jy for the _ n160 _ band .",
    "figure  [ fig : psf ] shows the azimuthally - averaged radial profiles of the measured psfs and compares them to the optical simulation model ( jeong et al .",
    "the averaged profiles are well reproduced by the two - component gaussian functions , whose parameters are summarized in tab .  [",
    "tab : psf ] .",
    "the full widths at the half maximum ( fwhm ) of the main gaussian component are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17  arcsec for the _ n60 _ , _ wide - s _ , _ wide - l _ , and _",
    "n160 _ bands , respectively . at the tails of the psfs ,",
    "there are significant excess compared with the optical simulation , whose contributions are about 20% of the total power .",
    "we did not see any significant dependence in the psfs on the infrared color of the targets .",
    "one property affecting the imaging quality is cross - talk between array pixels .",
    "this effect is seen only with the sw detector , which has a monolithic structure . in the maps of the sw detector ( _ n60 _ and _ wide - s _ ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] , cross - talk signals are clearly seen along the detector array axes .",
    "amplitude of the cross - talk signal is roughly 5% or less of the peak signal .",
    "possibility to explain this phenomenon is carrier diffusion or internal - reflection in the ge : ga substrate .",
    "another concern in terms of imaging quality is the presence of ghost signals .",
    "a ghost image appears in the all bands near the target image , and is prominent especially for the _ n160 _ band as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] .",
    "the center positions of broad - band and narrow - band arrays have an angular separation of @xmath16  arcmin in the scanning direction , and the ghost signal of each array appears separate time corresponding to the angular separation .",
    "therefore , the ghost signal appears in one array when a strong light enters the other array of the same detector .",
    "the cause of the ghost is presumably electrical cross - talk in the multiplexer of the cryogenic readout electronics . the position and intensity of the ghost signal to the target signal , which are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : ghost ] , had been stable throughout the mission .",
    "as long as the target is a point - source , the ghost should be removable .",
    "as described in sec .  4 , the final co - added maps produced by the ss - tool have units of surface brightness in mjy  @xmath18 , which has been calibrated in the ealier stage in the data processing by diffuse sources such as the zodiacal emission and the interstellar dust emission ( matsuura et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the application of aperture photometry for the co - added map gives the temporal flux of the target source .",
    "hereafter , we derive the calibration factors for point - source photometry based on the observations of the calibration standards .    for the source extraction and the aperture photometry , we used the photometry tools find , gcentrd , and aper in the idl astronomy user s library ( landsman 1993 ) at nasa / gsfc .",
    "these tools search for the center positions of point - sources with a gaussian window function of the same width as the psf , and measure the fluxes by integrating the pixel values within the aperture .",
    "the background sky levels were estimated to be the average of the surface brightness in the sky annulus , defined as  in radius for the _ wide - s _ and _ n60 _ bands , and  for the _ wide - l _ and _ n160 _ bands , respectively .",
    "the inner radius of the sky annulus is distant enough from the target source , and the outer radius is distant enough from the edges of the maps .    before performing the aperture photometry for all of the calibration standards , we compounded the encircled energy functions from the images of the bright sources that were used to measure the psfs .",
    "first we computed the encircled energy for each source with various aperture radii , and then normalized the result at the background sky flux level .",
    "the obtained profiles of the encircled energy show good agreement with each other , within @xmath13% for the shorter 3-bands and @xmath16% for the _ n160 _ band , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cog ] .",
    "the aperture correction factors as the normalized encircled energy functions are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : cog ] .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on all images of the calibration standards by using the aperture radius of for the _ wide - s _ and _ n60 _ bands , and for the _ wide - l _ and _ n160 _ bands , respectively , and applied the aperture correction with the factors tabulated in tab .",
    "[ tab : cog ] .",
    "these aperture radii are large enough to minimize uncertainties due to centroiding errors and to ensure that any uncertainties in the aperture correction have a small effect on the derived fluxes .",
    "in addition , these aperture sizes enable us to improve the s / n of the photometry and thereby to extend the calibration to the sources with somewhat fainter flux densities .",
    "we derive the uncertainty on each measurement from the scatter of the pixel values in the background annulus , which contributes both the uncertainty due to summing the object flux density as well as subtracting the background .    in order to derive the calibration factor for the point - source photometry , we compared the observed fluxes obtained by the aperture photometry with their model prediction .",
    "figure  [ fig : dpraw ] shows the observed - to - expected flux ratios for the calibration standards as a function of the expected flux .",
    "two asteroids ( germania and iris ) are excluded from the plot because of their poor model accuracies .",
    "the uncertainty on the flux ratios includes both photometric error and the expected model flux of the calibration standard . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpraw ] , even after the aperture correction , the observed fluxes are always lower than the expected fluxes .",
    "this means that the sensitivity to the point - sources is lower than that to the diffuse sources .",
    "in addition , the deviation seems to have flux - dependency .",
    "a plausible cause of this disagreement is the slow transient response of the ge : ga detectors .",
    "prior to the launch of akari , we had measured the slow response systematically under various photon flux conditions and established an empirical model ( kaneda et al .",
    "according to the model , the slow response should depend on the total photo - current ( background plus signal ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dp ] shows the observed - to - expected flux ratios , as a function of the total observed flux including the background . the observed background used here is the sum of the background sky brightness and the detector dark current . in order to convert the units of the background from mjy  @xmath18 to jy , the beam solid angle derived from the psf , which is summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : bsa ] , is multiplied .    as described in sec .  2 ,",
    "the reset interval was changed depending on the source flux . in fig .  [",
    "fig : dp ] , different symbols denote data with different reset intervals .",
    "because no systematic differences were seen , we deal with these data equally .    in the sw bands ,",
    "the background flux is so small that the total flux is dominated by the source flux .",
    "we can see a clear trend , the higher the total flux , the smaller the ratio . for bright sources ,",
    "the ratio is @xmath10.5 , while for faint sources , the ratio is @xmath10.8 , although they show large scatter .",
    "solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] are the results of power - law fitting to the data .",
    "the fitting results give @xmath19 the deviations of the data from the power - law are reasonably small , 13.7% and 12.7% for the",
    "_ n60 _ and _ wide - s _ bands , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the ratio is constant , the weighted means are @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the _ n60 _ and _ wide - s _ bands , respectively , and the deviation increases to approximately 20% for both bands . therefore , we conclude that there is a significant trend in the ratio with the total flux due to the slow transient response of the ge : ga detectors , and adopted the fitting results as the flux - dependent calibration factors .",
    "in contrast to the case of the sw bands , the total fluxes in the lw bands are dominated by the offset light .",
    "therefore , the total flux range is limited small , and the flux ratio does not show a clear flux dependence . unfortunately for the _ n160 _ band , a few data points does not give a firm conclusion but",
    "can suggest a trend as well as the _ wide - l _ band .",
    "no dependence of the flux ratio on the small flux range has been expected from an empirical model of stressed ge : ga photoconductor ( kaneda et al .",
    "the weighted means of the ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp ] are @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the _ wide - l _ and _ n160 _ bands , respectively .",
    "the results show that the lw detectors have much slower response than the sw detectors despite that it uses offset light to improve the slow transient response .",
    "the deviations of the data from the weighted means are 9.97% and 50.5% for the _ wide - l _ and _ n160 _ bands , respectively .",
    "the calibration accuracy of the _ n160 _ band are much lower than the other bands because of the small number of samples .      in this subsection , we perform various checks on the calibrations , such as comparison with previous missions , repeatability , the effects of scan speed , and observation mode",

    "<S> we present the characterization and calibration of the slow - scan observation mode of the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) onboard the akari satellite . </S>",
    "<S> the fis , one of the two focal - plane instruments on akari , has four photometric bands between 50180  @xmath0 with two types of ge : ga array detectors . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the all - sky survey , fis has also taken detailed far - infrared images of selected targets by using the slow - scan mode . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the slow - scan mode is one to two orders of magnitude better than that of the all - sky survey , because the exposure time on a targeted source is much longer . </S>",
    "<S> the point spread functions ( psfs ) were obtained by observing several bright point - like objects such as asteroids , stars , and galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the derived full widths at the half maximum ( fwhms ) are @xmath1 for the two shorter wavelength bands and @xmath1 for the two longer wavelength bands , being consistent with those expected by the optical simulation , although a certain amount of excess is seen in the tails of the psfs . the flux calibration has been performed by the observations of well - established photometric calibration standards ( asteroids and stars ) in a wide range of fluxes . after establishing the method of aperture photometry , the photometric accuracy for point - sources is better than @xmath215% in all of the bands expect for the longest wavelength . </S>"
