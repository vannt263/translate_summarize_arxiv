    "regions of massive star formation are usually more heavily embedded within their parent molecular cloud and rarer than sites where only low mass stars form , thus we have to look further to find statistically significant samples . in addition , massive stars form and evolve faster than low mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these issues mean that there are few large , well - selected samples of young massive stars , making it difficult to see global trends over the variations of individual sources , and thus restricting our understanding of the formation and early evolution of massive stars .",

    "large regions were not included in those lists based on comparison with single dish radio surveys , but more compact regions were found to contaminate these samples when followed up with higher resolution radio observations ( molinari et al .",
    "these criteria therefore tended to bias these samples away from complex regions where many massive stars form .    in order to alleviate this bias ,",
    "we have conducted a survey to find mysos in the galaxy . the red msx source ( rms )",

    "the msx psc has a peak and mean source density of 1812  sources / deg@xmath8 and 25  sources / deg@xmath8 respectively , so source confusion is not a significant issue in the original sample selection . a series of complementary follow - up observations have been carried out designed to identify contaminants ( low mass ysos , evolved stars , proto - planetary nebulae and planetary nebulae ) and provide the characteristics of the mysos , as well as the ultra - compact and compact regions also present in the sample @xcite .",

    "compact regions excited by stars with spectral types later than b1 may have radio surface brightnesses that are too low to be detected in our 1 radio observations , but would still exhibit strong hydrogen recombination emission with case - b @xcite line ratios in our near - ir spectroscopic observations ( see  [ s : conc ] ) .",

    "we wish to derive a luminosity function defined as the number of objects per unit volume per unit luminosity interval in the galaxy from the observed luminosity distributions , shown rebinned to 0.2 dex in figure  [ f : obtain_lfn_input_a ] .",
    "the first task is to examine the completeness of the sample as a function of luminosity .",
    "we do this by calculating the volume of the galaxy within which mysos and cs of luminosity l are detected by the rms survey .",
    "a 3-d grid of cells was set up in cylindrical polar coordinates ( i.e. @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , centred on the galactic centre .",
    "the volume of each cell was calculated ( @xmath16@xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 ) , along with the galactic coordinates ( @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 ) using the distance between the earth and the galactic centre of @xmath25  =  8.5  kpc @xcite .",
    "the distance between each cell and the earth was also calculated , which was then used to obtain the total flux ( @xmath26 ) that would be observed for a hypothetical source of luminosity @xmath27 within the cell .    since the rms sample is effectively a flux - limited sample in the msx 21   band we need to convert @xmath26 to @xmath28 for the hypothetical sources using the observed colours in the rms sample .",
    "the observed distribution of @xmath26@xmath13@xmath28 was obtained from sed model fits for young rms sources by @xcite , and takes the form of a gaussian in log(@xmath26@xmath13@xmath28 ) with mean 1.43 and standard deviation 0.27 ( see fig 7 .",
    "it is well known the shape of the seds of cs @xcite and myso @xcite are on average very similar , and no significant variation in @xmath26@xmath13@xmath28 between mysos and regions was found in the model seds . the mean ratio was therefore used to calculate the msx 21   flux in wm@xmath29 from @xmath26 for a hypothetical source of luminosity @xmath27 in the cell .",
    "these are then divided by the bandwidth of the msx 21 band in order to convert the flux to janskys .",
    "the completeness of the msx survey at 21 varies with @xmath22 and @xmath24 , particularly between the inner and outer galaxy due to the number of times each region of the sky was scanned , so we implement different flux limits ( @xmath30 ) for these two regions .",
    "given that most rms sources lie in the galactic mid - plane , we use @xmath30  =  3.5  jy for 270  @xmath7  @xmath22  @xmath7  90 and 4.25  jy for 90  @xmath31  @xmath22  @xmath31  270 based on the 50@xmath6 completion limits calculated for @xmath32  @xmath24  @xmath32  @xmath15  1 by davies ( 2010 , in prep ) . if a source with luminosity @xmath27 within the cell has @xmath33 then the volume of the cell is added to the total volume included in the rms survey",
    ".    the observed distributions of young rms sources with luminosities @xmath27  @xmath7  8.2@xmath410@xmath34 ( discussed in ",
    "[ s : results ] ) are shown in figures [ f : obtain_lfn_input_b ] and [ f : obtain_lfn_input_c ] in terms of galactocentric radius ( @xmath16 ) and distance from the galactic mid - plane ( @xmath18 ) respectively . given that these are far from uniformly distributed within the galaxy , a weighting function was used to weight the contribution made to the total volume by each cell according to the observed source distribution .",
    "this has the functional form of a thin disk with a hole in the centre as modelled by @xcite for the galactic stellar population of the thin disk .",
    "we adopted length scales for the disk ( @xmath35 ) and central hole ( @xmath36 ) consistent with our observed distribution in galactocentric radius ( see figure  [ f : obtain_lfn_input_b ] ) and also allowed for an offset ( @xmath37 ) from the galactic centre to account for the observed lack of sources with @xmath38 2  kpc .",
    "the distribution of sources in terms of @xmath18 ( figure  [ f : obtain_lfn_input_c ] ) is that of an exponential with scale - height @xmath39 .",
    "the weight is therefore given by :    @xmath40    a least - squares minimisation was used to obtain the values of the parameters in this function from the distribution of rms sources , which resulted in @xmath35  =  6.99  @xmath41  0.22  kpc , @xmath36  =  1.71  @xmath41  0.23  kpc ,",
    "@xmath37  =  2.20  @xmath41  0.10  kpc and @xmath39  =  39.0  @xmath41  1.8  pc , shown by the red solid lines in figures  [ f : obtain_lfn_input_b ] and [ f : obtain_lfn_input_c ] , with @xmath42=3.8 and 1.2 for the @xmath16 and @xmath18 fits respectively .",
    "this result does not change within the errors if luminosity cuts corresponding to 10@xmath6 or 90@xmath6 completeness are used instead of 50@xmath6 . the asymmetry in @xmath18 and the slight increase in the number of sources at @xmath16  =  10  kpc",
    "are probably due to local features near the sun ( @xmath25  =  8.5  kpc , @xmath43  =  15  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "both the shape of the distributions and the fit results are similar to those obtained previously for sites of massive star formation by @xcite and for regions by @xcite .",
    "the total weighted volume for which a source with luminosity @xmath27 should be included within the rms survey is therefore calculated by integrating the weighted cell volume over all cells with @xmath44 , -5  @xmath32  @xmath24  @xmath32  @xmath15  5 and 10  @xmath7  @xmath22  @xmath7  350 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this process was then repeated for logarithmic steps in luminosity .",
    "increments of 0.1  kpc , 0.5 and 0.01  kpc were used in @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , and all values were calculated for the cell centre .    the error in the luminosity is taken to be the bin width ( 0.2  dex ) and the error in the luminosity function is calculated from statistical uncertainty using poissonian statistics . only bins with at least 5 sources in them",
    "are considered in the following analysis , ensuring that while the average uncertainty in source luminosity is @xmath234@xmath6 @xcite , dominated by our conservative estimate of distance error , the ensemble uncertainty is smaller than the bin size .",
    "the volume of the galaxy sampled by the rms survey at each luminosity bin is shown in figure  [ f : results_lfuncs_a ] .",
    "this indicates that the rms survey should be @xmath45  50@xmath6 complete above @xmath28.2@xmath4  10@xmath34 , which corresponds to a spectral type of @xmath2b0.5v using the scale presented in table  [ t : obtain_lfn_spscales ] .",
    "we restrict the source distribution calculations to above the 50@xmath6 completion limit , as below this luminosity the volume correction required is @xmath31  2 .",
    "the luminosity functions were then obtained by dividing the source numbers in figure  [ f : obtain_lfn_input_a ] by the volume in figure  [ f : results_lfuncs_a ] and converting to per dex in l.    the resulting luminosity functions are shown above the 50@xmath6 completion limit in figure  [ f : results_lfuncs_b ] . over the luminosity range 10@xmath5  @xmath15  @xmath27  @xmath15  10@xmath1  , the myso luminosity function falls steadily such that log(@xmath46 )  =  ( -1.3  @xmath41  0.2 )  log(@xmath27/ ) + ( 6.9  @xmath41  0.9 ) .",
    "consequently , no significant population of mysos is observed above 10@xmath1   or earlier than @xmath2o6.5v .",
    "there is a flattening in the c region luminosity function around @xmath27  =  4@xmath410@xmath5   ( 09v ) . above this the luminosity function is fitted by log(@xmath47 )  =  ( -0.8  @xmath41  0.1 )  log(@xmath27/ ) + ( 5.0  @xmath41  0.8 ) .",
    "although the turnover in slope of the c region luminosity function is below the 100@xmath6 completeness limit , the fact that there is no similar break in the myso luminosity function that continues to lower luminosities means that the break is probably real .",
    "figure  [ f : results_lfuncs_c ] shows the luminosity function for the combined sample of all mysos and c regions identified in the rms survey .",
    "this shows the overall function for the young mid - ir bright phase of massive star formation regardless of whether the source is ionising its surroundings or not . above @xmath27  =  4@xmath410@xmath5   this combined luminosity function",
    "is fitted by log(@xmath48 )  =  ( -0.9  @xmath41  0.2 )  log(@xmath27/ )  +  ( 5.8  @xmath41  0.8 ) .",
    "@xcite used the number of main - sequence stars to estimate the lifetime for all uc regions , independent of luminosity , from the number of such sources they observed .",
    "the same method can be used to estimate the lifetimes of mysos and c regions as a function of luminosity , using @xmath46(@xmath27 ) and @xmath49(@xmath27 ) , i.e. :    @xmath50    where the main - sequence lifetime ( @xmath51 ) of an ob star is given by log(@xmath51/yrs )  =  ( 11.4  @xmath41  1.2 )  -  ( 1.5  @xmath41  0.5 )  log(@xmath27/ )  +  ( 0.11  @xmath41  0.05 )  log@xmath8(@xmath27/ ) calculated from a least - squares fit to the results of the models including stellar rotation by @xcite .",

    "the timescale of mysos decreases by a little less than an order of magnitude beween 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath1 , while the c region lifetime is flat with respect to luminosity at @xmath23@xmath410@xmath1yrs .",

    "here we find the c region lifetimes are @xmath23@xmath1010@xmath6 of their main - sequence lifetimes , although the main - sequence lifetimes we are using are about twice as long as those used by @xcite so our results are broadly consistent with theirs .",
    "we have obtained the luminosity functions of mysos and compact regions in the galactic plane .",
    "these clearly show that there is no significant population of the mid - ir bright , radio - quiet mysos above @xmath210@xmath1 .",
    "this lack of high luminosity mysos could mean that the immediate progenitors of the most luminous c regions are mid - ir faint or dark .",
    "luminous far - ir cores and methanol masers that are too faint to be in our msx - selected sample are being found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , it is also important to consider the luminosity function in terms of the mechanism that must inhibit the formation of regions around mysos , which are energetic enough to ionise their surroundings if they were on the main - sequence .",
    "previously it has been suggested that the accretion rate and/or high density of the surrounding material could quench or trap the region close to a young massive star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case the region would have a high enough emission measure ( em ) to be optically thick in the radio continuum , e.g. @xmath62  =  3@xmath410@xmath63  em  ( @xmath64pc)@xmath651 @xcite . unless such regions have em  @xmath31  10@xmath66 near - ir recombination lines will still be optically thin since their line centre optical depths are much lower , e.g. @xmath67  @xmath22@xmath410@xmath68  @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "this would lead to narrow lines with high equivalent widths whereas in mysos where we detect the nir continuum , we actually observe broad lines with low equivalent widths consistent with optically thick emission from stellar winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    alternatively , as first suggested by @xcite , the myso could be too cool to ionise its surroundings on account of being swollen due to high accretion rates .",
    "recent stellar evolution calculations including high accretion rates @xcite have suggested that the radius of stars with masses between @xmath28 and @xmath230 increase dramatically ( i.e. of order 10 - 100 times the main - sequence size ) due to high accretion rates .",
    "formation of an region around an actively accreting star only begins when it is massive enough that the kelvin - helmholtz timescale is less than the accretion timescale .",
    "we have shown that the timescale associated with mysos becomes comparable with the main - sequence kelvin helmholtz timescale at @xmath210@xmath1 .",
    "that we see no significant population of mysos with @xmath6910@xmath1 is consistent with this idea . for the most massive mysos ,",
    "i.e. those that have reached @xmath230 , the accretion rate must be between 10@xmath70  yr@xmath56 and 10@xmath55  yr@xmath56 , while the average accretion rates for less massive mysos are likely to be lower given the lifetimes we have obtained .",
    "the luminosity functions of mysos and regions presented in this paper can be used to test models of the time - evolution of the mass accretion rate and stellar properties .",
    "such modelling will be discussed in a future publication ( davies 2010 , in prep . ) .",
