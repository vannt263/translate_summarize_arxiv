    "the so - called `` uv - upturn '' phenomenon @xcite , i.e. , the rising ultraviolet emission shortward of 2000  , sometimes seen in the spectral energy distribution of elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spirals , has been for long a puzzling problem for old galaxy environments dominated by stars of mass comparable to that of the sun .",
    "spectroscopy and imaging @xcite of resolved color  magnitude ( c - m ) diagrams of stellar populations in m32 have definitely shown that this uv excess traces the presence of long - lived o - b stars , hotter than 30000 - 40000  k mostly hot hb stars further complemented , to a lesser extent , by a post - agb contribution of pn nuclei . however , at least two important issues need to be properly addressed to understand the real nature of the uv - upturn phenomenon .    _",
    "( i ) _ for such hot hb stars ( naturally residing in old , metal - poor globular clusters ) to be an output of super metal - rich environments , theory requires a quite delicate `` fine tuning '' of metallicity and stellar mass - loss efficiency , in order to achieve _ ( a ) _ the suitable partition between stellar internal he core and external envelope , and _ ( b ) _ a total mass @xmath0@xmath10.52  @xmath2 at the hb onset @xcite .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ observations indicate that metal - rich ellipticals display , at the same time , a stronger uv - upturn @xcite _ and _ a poorer planetary nebula ( pn ) production per unit galaxy luminosity @xcite . if the pn event is the final fate of agb stars at the end of their thermal pulsing phase @xcite , then a pn deficiency might be evidence of an incomplete ( or fully inhibited ) agb evolution of low - mass stars under special environment conditions of the parent galaxy .    as a central issue in this discussion ,",
    "_ it is clear , therefore , that a preeminent connection should exist between uv excess and agb distinctive properties of stellar populations in early - type galaxies . _",
    "@xcite first realized the potentially useful information , about their stellar populations , hidden in the surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ) of external galaxies with unresolved stellar populations .",

    ", @xmath10 is potentially the best tracer of the ssp tip stellar luminosity ( @xmath6 ) , since _ both quantities are expected to depend in quite the same way on the overall distinctive parameters of the stellar population , including age , metallicity , imf , and mass - loss _ ( see fig .  1 ) .    the tight relationship predicted by population synthesis theory",
    "is nicely confirmed when comparing with real stellar clusters spanning a wide range of evolutionary parameters , like for instance in the magellanic clouds ( mc ) . actually ,",

    "( iii ) _ a more careful comparison with the evolutionary synthesis models indicates that , on average , agb stars in ellipticals always experience the thermal - pulsing phase likely giving rise to the pn event .",
    "however , given a reduced agb extension among uv - enhanced galaxies , this situation is increasingly countered when either galaxy age or metallicity increase , and a higher number of stars end up as uv - bright _ agb - manqu _ objects @xcite , thus escaping the pn phase and directly feeding the high - temperature region of the galaxy c - m diagram .",
