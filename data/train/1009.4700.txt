    "the checkerboard lattice is a unique two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of great current interest .",
    "the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions , which are present on every other plaquette in a checkerboard pattern , not only can impose frustration and drive the system to exotic ground states but also provide a great tool for numerical and analytical investigators to study the evolution of physical properties in transitions between different geometries .",
    "for instance , in the limit of weak nnn interactions , it is expected that the physics associated with the simple square lattice is dominant . in the antiferromagnetic heisenberg ( afh )",
    "model , this means a tendency toward long - range nel ordering at temperatures smaller than the characteristic energy scale set by the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) magnetic exchange interaction , @xmath0 .",
    "whereas a ferromagnetic ( negative ) nnn exchange interaction , @xmath1 , favors this nel ordering , an antiferromagnetic ( positive ) one introduces frustration and , thus , new types of ordering such as a valence - bond solid emerge . in the fully frustrated region where @xmath5 , the lattice is a projection of the three - dimensional corner - sharing tetrahedrons ( pyrochlore lattice ) onto a 2d lattice .",
    "the other interesting limit is @xmath6 , where the 2d lattice is practically reduced to weakly coupled crossed chains , and physical properties are dominated by those of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) system .",
    "moreover , by eliminating certain bonds , one can even turn the focus from the square basis of the underlying lattice to a triangular one that can capture the geometry of the kagom lattice .",
    "the problem of the frustrated afh model on the checkerboard lattice has its roots in early studies on its three - dimensional counterpart , the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the latter system was originally studied by harris _",
    "_ @xcite using quantum field theory .",
    "they ruled out the possibility of a phase with long - range spin correlations but found strong correlation between nn spins , suggesting a dimerized ground state .",
    "a few years later , using perturbative expansions and exact diagonalization , canals and lacroix  @xcite concluded that the ground state is a spin - liquid with correlations that decay exponentially by distance . around the same time , another study by isoda and mori ,  @xcite in which a bond - operator approach was used , suggested a resonant - valence - bond - like plaquette phase .",
    "so far , the magnetic properties of the checkerboard lattice have been the focus of many theoretical studies ,  @xcite with compelling evidence that the ground state for @xmath7 ( the planar pyrochlore ) is a plaquette valence - bond solid ( p - vbs ) with long - range quadrumer order .",

    "there are at least two proposals for the ground state in this region of the parameter space ; the first is the 2d spin - liquid ground state ( sliding luttinger liquid ) characterized by the absence of long - range order and by elementary excitations being massless deconfined spinons .",
    "@xcite this idea is supported by an exact diagonalization study of sindzingre _ et al._,@xcite which suggests a range of @xmath15 $ ] for the 1d behavior .",
    "however , their calculations suffer from strong finite - size effects even with @xmath16 sites due to the quasi-1d nature of the problem .",
    "the second is the crossed - dimer ( cd ) phase suggested by starykh _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite they argued that , in the cd phase , staggered dimer correlations , which have a power - law decay with distance in a perfect 1d system , are stabilized when a weak interchain interaction ( @xmath0 ) is present .",

    "most recently , using a two - leg ladder to construct the 2d lattice in a density matrix renormalization group study , and by measuring various spin - spin correlations , moukouri  @xcite confirmed most of these predictions for the phase diagram except that the magnetically ordered phase in the proximity of the cd phase has a wave vector @xmath13 instead of the @xmath4 proposed in ref .  .",

    "however , a systematic study of finite - temperature properties in the thermodynamic limit , more relevant to experiments , has been missing . our goal in this study is to explore the thermodynamic properties of this model and address the finite - temperature behavior of the susceptibilities to the ordered phases proposed for the ground state and described above .",

( [ eq : cd ] ) with a minus sign between the two terms ] and found a behavior qualitatively similar the cd susceptibility but with smaller values ( not shown ) .",
    "since the cd phase was predicted to exist for @xmath6  @xcite , an interesting question posed by these results is whether the peak feature will eventually disappear for smaller values of @xmath74 and one would find a susceptibility that always increases with decreasing temperature . in this scenario , the relevant temperature at which the cd phase becomes dominant is @xmath131  @xcite , which is beyond the convergence region of our current nlce calculations .",
    "we find that for large values of @xmath132 ( weakly coupled crossed chains ) , there are two magnetic orderings that are dominant at the lowest temperatures we can study .",

    "[ fig : nel]).,width=316 ]    these results are consistent with what one would expect at intermediate temperatures in the limit of @xmath6 , because both orders are compatible with the antiferromagnetic correlations that develop along the diagonal chains .",
    "we note that for the ed with the @xmath38-site cluster , using adjacency matrices , one can show that the modified hamiltonians , @xmath133 , are identical for the two order parameters .",
    "it would have been interesting to compare ed results for both orders with larger system sizes ; however , given the unit cell size for each order ( eight sites for the nel@xmath12 and four sites for the stripe ) and our computational limitations with increasing system sizes , those results are only available for the stripe order and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nl4 ] . resolving which order becomes dominant at lower temperatures will require the study of larger cluster sizes , both in nlces and in ed .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , based on numerical calculations , the stripe order was suggested to be the one relevant to the ground state of the @xmath134 model when @xmath135.@xcite     per site , calculated using ed with @xmath38 sites , versus temperature .",

    "( this applies to the previously mentioned orders as well , but , due to the presence of other symmetries , computations are less costly in those cases . )",

    "therefore , a transition to this phase seems unlikely in any of the parameter regions .",
    "the fact that this type of order is not favored close to the 1d limit is not surprising since , unlike in the nel@xmath12 or stripe ordered phases , spins on diagonal chains are not antiferromagnetically aligned .",
    "we have calculated the thermodynamic properties of the afh model on the checkerboard lattice using nlces and ed , and studied their behavior as the system crosses over from a simple square lattice ( @xmath68 ) to the maximally frustrated planar pyrochlore lattice ( @xmath7 ) to the limit of one - dimensional crossed chains ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we found that the peak value in the specific heat is suppressed as the frustration increases ( by increasing @xmath54 from @xmath136 to @xmath34 ) , with strong indications that there is a second peak in the specific heat for @xmath19 . in the same region ,",
    "finite - size effects in ed are minimal for temperatures above the convergence limit of nlce .",
    "in contrast , close to the 1d limit , ed results can vary significantly from one cluster to the other , depending on the size of periodic 1d chains that exist inside each 2d cluster .",
    "consistent with the reduced specific heat , entropy is maximal when @xmath7 at low temperatures with a decrease that is slower than @xmath89 .",
