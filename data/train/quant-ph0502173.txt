    "an important question in quantum information science is to determine the minimum time required to perform a quantum computation using a set of physical resources . since two - qubit gates are the building blocks of quantum information processing , it is of fundamental interest to find the minimal time required to implement a unitary operation on a two - qubit system using the interaction hamiltonian @xmath0 , and the local unitary operations on the two qubits .",
    "this problem was studied in  @xcite , where it was shown that any two qubit unitary propogator @xmath1 can be expressed as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 are local unitary transformations and the effective hamiltonians @xmath4 all mutually commute . under the assumption that the synthesis of local unitaries takes arbitrarily small time , the minimum time to produce a desired @xmath1 is the smallest value of @xmath5 in equation ( [ eq : topt ] )  @xcite .",
    "this characterization of time optimal trajectories is used in  @xcite to explicitly compute an elegant expression for the minimal time for synthesis of arbitrary unitary transformation of two qubits . alternate proofs for time optimality",

    "there is now a considerable literature on the subject ; see for example ,  @xcite and references therein .",
    "all these investigations assume that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath0 is fixed . in this paper",
    ", we consider the general problem when @xmath0 varies with time .",
    "for example , in solid state nmr  @xcite , the interaction between the spins are varying with time during magic angle spinning when the sample is rotated around an axis making an angle of @xmath6 with the static magnetic field @xmath7 . as a result",
    "the dipolar couplings between nuclear spins that have an orientational dependence of the form @xmath8 averages out ( @xmath9 is the angle of internuclear axis with the static magnetic field ) , leading to better resolved nmr spectrum  @xcite .",
    "an important problem in multi - dimensional solid state nmr experiments is to find radio - frequency pulse sequence that re - couple desired spins whose interactions are being modulated in time by magic angle spinning .",
    "finding short pulse sequences that transfer polarization or coherence between coupled nuclear spins under time varying interactions is of interest in solid state nmr . in this paper",
    ", we give a complete characterization of all the unitary transformations that can be synthesized in a given time for a two - qubit system in presence of general time varying coupling tensor , assuming that the local unitary transformation on two qubits can be performed arbitrarily fast(on a time scale governed by the strength of couplings ) . from the perspective of quantum control theory , this problem is equivalent to characterizing the reachable set of the schr@xmath10dinger equation @xmath11u(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the interaction hamiltonian that is internal to the system and @xmath14 is the part of the hamiltonian that can be externally changed , and generates the local unitary operations .",
