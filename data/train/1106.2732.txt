    "photodegradation in dye doped polymers was extensively studied and modeled in several systems@xcite .",
    "recently , reversible photodegradation was observed for dye molecules when doped in polymers@xcite but not in liquids@xcite .",
    "a logical hypothesis is that dye diffusion is responsible for this effect .",
    "dye diffusion is a common phenomenon in azo dye - doped polymer systems@xcite .",
    "there are many applications that are based on dye diffusion such as thermal transfer printing@xcite or holographic surface relief gratings@xcite .",
    "photoinduced dye diffusion is observed in various dye - polymer systems and has been thoroughly studied over the past decade@xcite .",
    "we previously reported on candidate mechanisms that could be responsible for reversible photodegradation@xcite in 1-amino-2-methyl anthraquinone ( commonly known as disperse orange 11 ) when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate)(pmma ) .",
    "this paper focuses specifically on eliminating the likelihood of dye diffusion alone as a cause of self - healing effects .",
    "et al _ s imaging studies@xcite of photodamage show the visual recovery of a burn track , yet it alone does not fully rule out the possibility of diffusion .    in this paper , we present experimental observations of changes in absorption spectrum of a damaged area , which support the hypothesis of the formation of a damaged species and subsequent self healing back to the original molecule .",
    "we also report on measurements of the time evolution of the population density profile and show that they are inconsistent with theoretically - simulated profiles due to diffusion .",

    "this pump beam also produces amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) light that propagates along the excitation line .",
    "the absorption spectrum is measured as a function of time using a white light probe that spatially overlaps the pump beam at the sample .",
    "the inset in figure [ t090318q-02 ] shows a cartoon of the overlap between the probe beam and pump beam line .",
    "the sample is pumped for 20 minutes , during which time the absorption spectrum is measured at @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 to probe photodegradation .",
    "subsequently , the laser is blocked to allow the sample to self heal .",
    "the absorption spectrum is measured again after 2 hours of healing .",
    "the experiment is described in more detail in the literature@xcite .",
    "diffusion is characterized by a decrease of population in the bright regions , leading to an absorption spectrum of the same shape but decreased area .",
    "figure 1 shows the absorption spectrum plotted as a function of energy at various times with the initial spectrum subtracted .",
    "the dotted curve shows the initial absorption spectrum of the sample .",
    "an isobestic point for a series of linear absorption spectra is an indication of the conversion of one molecular structure into another one , or changes in the molecular structure ; but , is not expected for diffusion .",
    "the depletion of undamaged molecules is clear from the dip at 2.57ev that characterizes the do11 molecule , while the growing peak at 3.2ev is an indication of the formation of a damaged population .",
    "there is a clear isobestic point between these two regions .",
    "after two hours , the damaged population characterized by the peak at 3.2ev decreases and the dip at 2.57ev decreases showing recovery of the sample . a two peak fit to the curves ( not shown ) approximately yields an equal area under the dip and peak showing the conservation of population of molecules in the region probed with the white light source . while this data clearly shows the conversion between two molecular structures , it does not rule out contributions from diffusion .",
    "the amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) intensity and the fluorescence intensity are related to the population density in the pump region . as such",
    ", a mapping of the collected fluorescence or ase light as a function of pump position can be used to determine the population profile as a function time .",
    "+    we use the line focus of the pump laser both to burn a damage line into the sample and to measure the population profile by monitoring fluorescence / ase while translating the pump line through the burn line .",
    "since the line focus is of transverse gaussian intensity profile , we expect the burn mark to also have a gaussian profile",
    ". the fluorescence / ase profile will thus be a convolution of the undamaged population density profile and the pump intensity profile .",
    "if diffusion is a dominant mechanism , we would expect a buildup of population just outside the burn line due to photothermally - induced transport of molecules away from the hot area .",
    "figure [ 110427 - 01 ] shows that there is no significant increase of fluorescence / ase emission when the sample is pumped near the edges of the burn line .    since ase is a nonlinear process , the width of the cross correlation function determined from a scan is narrower than it is for linear fluorescence  as observed in figure [ 110427 - 01 ] .",
    "figure [ 110407 - 01 ] shows the time evolution of the ase profile as a function of time during recovery .",
    "the decrease in the width of these curves is consistent with the fact that ase is a nonlinear process .",
    "in this section , we present a model of dye diffusion in a polymer due to a photo - induced temperature gradient .",
    "we consider the contribution of diffusion to the mechanisms of photo - degradation and self - healing by simulating both the population loss in the illuminated region and the return of population when the sample recovers in the dark .",
    "it is well known that the equilibrium population density of a molecular species is altered by a temperature gradient due to molecular diffusion in the host material@xcite .",
    "fick s first law for particles in a material with a temperature gradient is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the diffusion flux , @xmath6 is the concentration , @xmath7 is the mobility , @xmath8 is the force from the temperature gradient , @xmath9 is the diffusivity , @xmath10 is the time , and @xmath11 is the position .    the force on dye molecules from the temperature gradient , @xmath8 , can be expressed in terms of the temperature , @xmath12 , and the transport heat , @xmath13 .",
    "this gives @xmath14 the mobility of the dye molecules in the polymer is given by @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the chemical potential .",
    "note that this assumes a constant volume .",
    "we now can rewrite fick s first law for constant volume with concentration and temperature gradient as @xmath16    the parameters used in each simulation are chosen according to the experimental conditions .",
    "the samples are approximately @xmath17 m thick and @xmath18 cm square .",
    "the pump beam , of gaussian profile , is focused by a cylindrical lens onto the flat surface of the sample .",
    "the line focus spans the entire length of the sample in one direction .",
    "the transverse beam intensity profile is much smaller than the width of the sample . since measurements are taken in the center of the sample , we approximate the beam as an infinitely long heat source .",

    "a photo - induced heat source is valid for any system that exhibits a thermal diffusivity that is much greater than the diffusivity of the molecules through the medium , which is valid for a dye - doped polymer @xcite .",

    "thus , for an initial uniform concentration @xmath26 therefore , the concentration only varies in the @xmath21-direction for a line focus heat source along @xmath22 .",
    "the diffusion equation in one dimension is @xmath27 assuming that the diffusivity is constant with respect to the small changes in concentration , equation [ eq : difftx ] can be rewritten using the quotient rule in terms of separate derivatives of the concentration and temperature @xmath28 + d \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2 } , \\label{eq : difftxexplicit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath7 , and @xmath13 are approximated as constants with respect to the concentration and the spatial coordinate .",
    "the temperature profile is @xmath29 where figure [ fig : templine ] shows the temperature distribution in the plane of the thin - film sample .",
    "substituting equation [ eq : tempprofilex ] into equation [ eq : difftxexplicit ] , and setting @xmath30 , gives @xmath31 \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to avoid small errors at the boundaries due to numerical approximations , we impose dirichlet ( rather than neumann ) boundary conditions at @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the length of each edge of the square sample and the boundaries are far from the heat source .",
    "this is especially important for computing small changes over long periods of time .",
    "the dirichlet boundary conditions are @xmath34 we also assume that the concentration is uniform before the laser is turned on , or , @xmath35    we begin by first solving the diffusion equation while the pump laser is on to determine the initial concentration profile when the laser is turned off and the sample begins to heal . at this time , equation [ eq : difftempxexp ] reduces to the simplest form of the diffusion equation , @xmath36    equation [ eq : difftempxexp ] has no transient solutions in an analytical form of common functions .",
    "therefore , we must find a numerical approximation to determine the concentration as a function of time and position due to the temperature gradient induced by the laser .",
    "the crank - nicolson method is used to solve all diffusion equations .",
    "we investigate two cases .",
    "the first involves pure diffusion , which assumes that there are no chemical reactions .",
    "the second assumes that there are two process ; namely , a partial burn due to photochemistry and dye diffusion . for both cases",

    "note that we assume @xmath39k - values that are typical in our experiments .",

    "_ et al__@xcite studied the transmission of light in a thin sample of do11-doped pmma as a function of time while the material is recovering . assuming that the recovery process is due to diffusion , these images can be used to determine the fractional change in the concentration as a function of position and time . to do so",

    "however , the data clearly shows that only the amplitude changes , not the width .",
    "thus , we conclude that a pure diffusion mechanism can not explain the data .",
    "we now consider the case where there are two processes : a permanent photochemical burn and dye diffusion .",
    "the permanent burn is identified by the residual change in transmittance at @xmath52minutes .",
    "the image is found to be constant for up to @xmath53minutes .",

    ", the diffusion equation predicts that the width of the concentration profile increases .",
    "again , we find that the data and theory disagree , so that diffusion does not appear to contribute .",

    "the theory of diffusion and the experimental results do not agree .",
    "thus , the contribution of diffusion to self healing of do11 in pmma polymer must be negligible .    the isobestic point and the evolution of the linear absorbance spectrum of do11 in pmma suggests that the damaged species is structurally distinct from the initial molecule . while diffusion due to localized laser heating may be present , our measurements show that its effect is negligible . ruling out dye diffusion",
