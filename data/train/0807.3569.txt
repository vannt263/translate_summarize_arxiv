    "the physics program at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory is remarkably rich , thanks to the machine s unique ability to collide nuclei from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , in fully symmetric ( e.g.  or  ) to strongly asymmetric ( e.g. @xmath3 ) entrance channels , over an energy range spanning more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the capability to collide polarized protons provides access to an entirely new set of fundamental physics , not discussed further here .    achieving the primary aim of rhic the creation and characterization of a color - deconfined state of matter and its transition back to the confined ( hadronic ) state requires the full capabilities of rhic .",
    "in particular , comparisons of particle distributions at high transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) from  and  collisions , probe the color - opaque nature of the hot system formed in the collisions  @xcite .",
    "comparison with reference @xmath5 collisions were necessary to identify the role of initial - state effects in the spectra  @xcite .",
    "comparing anisotropic collective motion from non - central collisions of different - mass initial states ( e.g.  versus @xmath6 )  @xcite tests the validity of transport calculations crucial to claims of the creation of a `` perfect liquid '' at rhic  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a main component of the future heavy ion program at rhic involves a detailed energy scan , designed to identify a predicted critical point in the equation of state of qcd  @xcite .",
    "the need for such systematic comparisons is not unique to rhic , but has been a generic feature of all heavy ion programs  @xcite , from low - energy facilities like the nscl ( michigan state ) , to progressively higher - energy facilities at sis ( gsi ) , the bevatron / bevalac ( berkeley lab ) , ags ( brookhaven ) , and sps ( cern ) .",
    "the nature of heavy ion physics is such that little is learned through study of a single system .      despite the necessary attention to smaller colliding partners ,",
    "these comparisons are ultimately aimed at identifying novel aspects of collisions between the heaviest ions , in which a highly excited _ bulk system _ might be created , with a sufficient number of degrees of freedom such that it may be described thermodynamically e.g. in terms of pressure , temperature , energy density , and an equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "if the energy density of this system is sufficiently large ( typically estimated at @xmath7  gev/@xmath8  @xcite ) and its spatial extent considerably larger than the color - confinement length @xmath9  1  fm , then a new state of matter the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite may be created .",
    "microscopically , such a state might be characterized by colored objects ( or something more complicated  @xcite ) ; macroscopically , it represents a region on the phase diagram in which the eos is distinctly different than for the hadronic phase  @xcite .",
    "ultra - relativistic collisions between the heaviest nuclei enjoy the additional advantage that finite - size effects are small , due to high - multiplicity final states . in a small system ( e.g. final state of an @xmath10 collision )",
    "a statistical analysis of yields requires a canonical treatment , due to the conservation of discreet quantum numbers such as baryon number and strangeness  @xcite . for larger systems ,",
    "a grand canonical treatment is more common  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with finite quantum - number effects absorbed into , e.g. `` saturation factors ''  @xcite .    due to the large available energy @xmath11 and final - state multiplicity , energy and momentum conservation effects on kinematic observables (",
    "spectra , momentum correlations , elliptic flow ) are generally small .",
    "they are accounted for with correction factors  @xcite or neglected altogether .",
    "detailed single - particle spectra ( e.g. @xmath12 ) have been measured at rhic , for a variety of particle types . often , the shape of the `` soft '' ( @xmath13  gev / c ) part of the spectrum is compared to hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite or fitted to simple `` blast - wave '' parameterizations  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) to extract the collective flow of the system . the `` hard '' sector (",
    "@xmath14  gev / c ) is assumed to be dominated by the physics of the initial - state , high-@xmath15 parton collisions and resulting jets .",
    "the physics of the `` firm '' sector ( @xmath16  gev / c ) may be the richest of all , reflecting the dynamics of the confinement process itself  @xcite",
    ".    we would like to focus not so much on the single - particle spectra themselves , but on their multiplicity dependence .",
    "much has been inferred from this dependence . in the soft sector ,",
    "blast - wave fits to spectra from high - multiplicity final states ( associated with central @xmath17 collisions ) indicate strong collective radial flow ; the same fits to low - multiplicity final states including minimum bias  collisions appear to indicate much weaker flow  @xcite .",
    "this seems to confirm a common assumption that  collisions are not sufficiently `` large '' to develop bulk collective behaviour .    in the hard sector ,",
    "one of the earliest and most exciting observations  @xcite at rhic was that the high-@xmath4 yield from high - multiplicity  collisions was suppressed , relative to appropriately scaled lower - multiplicity @xmath17 or minimum bias  collisions .",
    "this has been taken as evidence of energy loss of hard - scattered partons through a very color - dense medium .",
    "meanwhile , the high-@xmath4 part of the spectrum from high - multiplicity  collisions appear _ enhanced _ relative to low - multiplicity  collisions  @xcite , again suggesting that a color - dense bulk system is not produced in  collisions .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the effects of energy and momentum conservation on the multiplicity evolution of single - particle spectra at rhic .",
    "energy and momentum conservation - induced constraints ( emcics )   have been largely ignored in the analyses just mentioned , probably due to two reasons .",
    "the first is the field s usual focus on the highest - multiplicity collisions , where such effects are assumed small ; it seems natural to compare analyses of such systems to `` identical '' ones of smaller systems , forgetting that emcic effects play an ever - increasing role in the latter case .",
    "perhaps the more important reason is that emcics do not generate `` red flag '' structures on single - particle spectra ; this is in contrast to multi - particle correlation analyses , in which conservation law - induced correlations may be manifestly obvious and have even been used to estimate the number of unmeasured neutral particles in high energy collisions  @xcite . especially with the enhanced attention on precision and detail at the sps and rhic , there has been increasing discussion of emcic effects in 2-particle  @xcite , 3-particle  @xcite , and @xmath18-particle  @xcite observables .",
    "below , we show that emcic effects on single - particle spectra are also significant , and may even dominate their multiplicity evolution .",
    "several authors  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have discussed finite - number effects in statistical models , and many numerical simulations of subatomic collisions conserve energy and momentum automatically  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , as pointed out by knoll  @xcite , our question to what extent do emcics _",
    "alone _ explain the multiplicity evolution of spectra? can not be addressed from these simulations themselves , since dynamic and kinematic evolution are interwoven in these models .",
    "thus , in section  [ sec:2 ] , we discuss a formalism based on hagedorn s generalization of fermi s golden rule , in which dynamics and kinematics ( phasespace ) factorize .",
    "this leads to a formula for finite - number effects on single - particle spectra , due solely to kinematics , for a fixed dynamical ( `` parent '' ) distribution .    in section",
    "[ sec : test ] , we test the extreme ansatz that _ all _ of the experimentally - measured multiplicity dependence of single - particle spectra is due to emcics . we will find surprising agreement with this ansatz in the soft sector ( @xmath19  gev / c ) .",
    "we will discuss that our formalism is on less firm footing , conceptually and mathematically , at much higher @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , we explore this regime as well .",
    "we find that , in the hard sector , the data from heavy ion collisions is clearly _ not _ dominated by emcics , though we point out that ignoring emcics , especially for @xmath0 collisions , may be dangerous even at high @xmath4 .    in sections  [ sec : discussion ] and",
    "[ sec : outlook ] , we summarize and give an outlook for future studies .",
    "changing the size ( central versus peripheral ion collisions , @xmath20 collisions , etc ) and energy of a collision system will lead to different measured single - particle distributions , reflecting ( 1 ) possibly different physical processes driving the system and ( 2 ) effects due to phase space restrictions . to focus on changes caused by the latter , we consider some lorentz - invariant `` parent '' distribution @xmath21 , driven by some unspecified physical process , but",
    "_ un_affected by energy and momentum conservation . for simplicity , we assume that all particles obey the same parent distribution .    in the absence of other correlations , the measured single - particle distribution is related to the parent according to  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath18 is the event multiplicity .",
    "the integral in the numerator of equation  [ eq : emcic1 ] represents the number of configurations in which the @xmath23 other particles counter - balance @xmath24 so as to conserve the total energy - momentum @xmath25 of the event , and the denominator , integrating over all @xmath18 particles , is a normalization .    for @xmath26  @xcite",
    ", one may use the central limit theorem to rewrite the factor in equation  [ eq : emcic1 ] as  @xcite @xmath27 \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 are average quantities and we have set the average three - momentum @xmath29 .",
    "we stress that what appears in equation  [ eq : averages ] is the parent distribution @xmath30 , not the measured one @xmath31 .",
    "hence , for finite multiplicity @xmath18 , the averages @xmath32 are not the measured ones , which we define as @xmath33 see also the discussion in appendix  [ sec : applicabilityappendix ] .",
    "since @xmath4 distributions are commonly reported , we would like to estimate emcic distortions to @xmath4 distributions , integrated over azimuth and a finite rapidity bin centered at midrapidity . as discussed in appendix",
    "[ sec : rapidityappendix ] , for the approximately boost - invariant distributions at rhic  @xcite , the measured and parent @xmath4 distributions are related by @xmath34 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the notation @xmath35 indicates the average of a @xmath36 over the rapidity interval used ; see appendix  [ sec : rapidityappendix ] for details .",
    "these averages depend , of course , on @xmath4 and should not be confused with global averages @xmath37 ( equation  [ eq : averages ] ) which characterize the parent distribution .",
    "we would also like to emphasize the fact that since equation  [ eq : emcfpt ] depends on the energy of the particle ( not just momentum ) it becomes clear that the emcic effects are larger on heavier particles at the same @xmath4 .",
    "thus we should expect that the proton spectra will be more suppressed than pion spectra . in what follows , we find that ignoring the @xmath38 term does not affect our results , since the numerator is small for the narrow rapidity windows used here , and the denominator is large . in discussions below ,",
    "we set this term to zero .      equations  [ eq : emcic1]-[eq : emcfpt ] are reminiscent of fermi s `` golden rule ''  @xcite , in which the probability for making a particular observation is given by the product of the squared matrix element and a quantity determined by available phase space .",
    "the first term represented the underlying physical process . in his original statistical model",
    "@xcite , fermi originally assumed it to be a constant representing the volume in which emitted particles were produced ; this is equivalent to setting @xmath39 constant in equation  [ eq : emcic1 ] . while surprisingly successful in predicting cross sections and pion spectra  ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission volume required to describe the data was considered unrealistically large  @xcite . using the mean value theorem ,",
    "hagedorn  @xcite generalized the theory so that the `` physics term '' is the interaction matrix element , suitably averaged over all final states .",
    "we wish to make no assumptions about the underlying physics ( represented by @xmath30 ) driving the observed spectrum @xmath31 .",
    "rather , we wish to quantify the effect of changing the multiplicity @xmath18 , which appears in the phase space term .    in particular , in the following section ,",
    "we compare measured single - particle spectra for different event classes .    we that the parent distributions for , say classes @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are the same ( @xmath42 ) . by equation  [ eq : averages ]",
    ", this implies @xmath43 . in this case , the _ only _ reason that the observed spectra differ ( @xmath44 ) is the difference in `` multiplicity '' @xmath45 ; see section  [ sec : postulatedetails ] for a discussion of @xmath46 .    to eliminate the ( unknown ) parent distribution itself , we will study the ratio of observed @xmath4 distributions , which , by equation  [ eq : emcfpt ] becomes @xmath47 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath48 is discussed at the end of section  [ sec : postulatedetails ] . as mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : fermi ] , numerically unimportant terms in @xmath49",
    "have been dropped .",
    "naturally , our postulate can not be expected to be entirely correct ; one may reasonably expect the mix of physical processes in  collisions to differ from those in  collisions .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to find the degree to which the change in single - particle spectra may be attributed _ only _ to finite - multiplicity effects .",
    "we will find that the postulate works surprisingly well in some regions , and fails in others .",
    "as we will discuss , both the success and failure raise interesting and surprising possibilities .",
    "by our postulate , the phase space factor affecting a @xmath4 distribution is driven by four quantities .",
    "three , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , characterize the parent distribution , while @xmath18 is the number of particles in the final state .",
    "in general , increasing any one parameter decreases the effect of phase space restrictions on the observed distributions .",
    "but what should we expect these values to be",
    "? they should characterize the relevant system in which a limited quantity of energy and momentum is shared .",
    "they are not , however , directly measurable , and should only approximately scale with measured values , for at least five reasons discussed here .",
    "firstly , the energy and momentum is shared among measured and unmeasured ( neutrals , neutrinos , etc . )",
    "particles alike so that @xmath18 should roughly track the measured event multiplicity @xmath53 , but need not be identical to it .",
    "secondly , emission of resonances smears the connection between @xmath18 and @xmath53 ; e.g. the emission of an omega meson which later decays into `` secondary '' particles ( @xmath54 ) increments @xmath18 by unity , rather than three , as far as other particles are concerned .",
    "this latter consideration also affects the kinematic parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "while energy and momentum are , of course , conserved in resonance decay , the aforementioned quantities , themselves , are not .",
    "thus , one need not expect perfect correspondence between the appropriate kinematic parameters in equation  [ eq : ratio ] , and the measured ones .",
    "thirdly , even restricting consideration to primary particles , it is unclear that all of them should be considered in the relevant ensemble of particles sharing some energy and momentum . in particular , for space - time extended systems in high - energy collisions , the momentum extent of characteristic physics processes ( e.g. string breaking ) and causality in an approximately boost - invariant scenario suggest that rapidity slices of roughly unit extent should be considered separate subsystems  @xcite .",
    "of course , the total available energy in any event is shared among _ all _ such subsystems ; i.e. the midrapidity subsystem in one event will not have exactly the same available energy as that in another event .",
    "however , such fluctuations are to be expected in any case surely individual collisions will differ from one another to some extent .",
    "thus , we repeat our interpretation of the four parameters @xmath18 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 : they characterize the scale , in energy and momentum , of the limited available phasespace to an @xmath18-particle subsystem .",
    "fourthly , equations  [ eq : emcic1]-[eq : ratio ] are appropriate for fixed @xmath18 , while we will be comparing to measured spectra selected by measured charged - particle multiplicity .",
    "thus , @xmath18 would inevitably fluctuate within an event class , even if we could ignore the above considerations . naturally , high multiplicity events contribute to spectra more than low multiplicity events . similarly , the average multiplicity in two - particle correlations is even more shifted to higher multiplicities .",
    "fifthly , as already mentioned in section  [ sec : fermi ] , the kinematic parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to the parent distribution , which will only correspond identically to the measured one in the limit of infinite multiplicity ( i.e. no emcic distortions ) .",
    "see also the discussion in appendix  [ sec : applicabilityappendix ] .    for all of these reasons , we will treat @xmath18 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 as free parameters when testing our postulate against data .",
    "our aim is not to actually measure these quantities by fitting the data with equation  [ eq : ratio ] ; this is good , since our fits to the data only very roughly constrain our four parameters , as discussed in the next section .",
    "rather , our much less ambitious goal is to see whether `` reasonable '' values of these parameters can explain the multiplicity evolution of the spectra .    to get a feeling for these values , we look at  collisions at = 200  gev , simulated by the pythia  event generator ( v6.319 )  @xcite . in the model",
    ", we can identify primary particles , thus avoiding some of the issues discussed above .",
    "however , the fact that pythia  conserves momentum means that we access @xmath55 as defined by equation  [ eq : measuredaverages ] , not the parameters of the parent distribution .",
    "nevertheless , a scale for our expectations may be set .",
    "table  [ tab : pythiaprim ] summarizes the result for primary particles satisfying a varying cut on pseudorapidity where all particle decays where switched off in pythia  simulations .",
    "the results from simulations when resonance decays were included in simulations are presented in table  [ tab : pythiaall ] .",
    "these two tables gives us rough estimates of ranges of the total multiplicity and kinematic variables that one may expect .",
    "the bulk component of single - particle spectra is often estimated with maxwell - boltzmann distributions , with inverse slope parameters in the range @xmath56 .",
    "again , simply for rough guidance , we list maxwell - boltzmann expectations for our kinematic parameters in table  [ tab : limits ] , assuming pion - dominated system .",
    ".for a given selection on pseudorapidity @xmath57 , the number and kinematic variables for primary particles from a pythia  simulation of @xmath0 collisions at @xmath58  gev are given .",
    "units are gev / c or ( gev / c)@xmath59 , as appropriate .",
    "100k events were used and all decays were switched off in simulations . [ tab : pythiaprim ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the spectra reported by star are for unidentified negative hadrons . in calculating these curves",
    ", we assumed that all particles were pions .",
    "this matters , since the energy terms in equation  [ eq : ratio ] require the particle mass .",
    "we expect the energy - momentum scales listed in table  [ tab : pp ] to be affected by this simplistic assumption .",
    "particle - identified spectra from multiplicity - selected  collisions would be required , to do better .",
    "given this , and the only semi - quantitative agreement between the calculations and measured ratios shown in figure  [ fig : nonidspectrafitszoom ] , we conclude only that the emcic contribution to the multiplicity evolution of low-@xmath4 spectra in  collisions is at least of the same order as the observed effect itself .",
    "spectra shown by full points in figure  [ fig : starnonidspectra ] .",
    "spectra for the lowest - multiplicity ( red triangles ) , fifth - lowest ( green triangles ) and seventh - lowest ( squares ) multiplicity collisions are divided by the spectrum for the second - highest multiplicity collisions .",
    "curves represent a calculation of this ratio ( ratio of emcic factors ) using equation  [ eq : ratio ] ; see text for details .",
    "[ fig : nonidspectrafitszoom],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      figure  [ fig : softratio ] shows the central result of this paper : namely , that the multiplicity evolution of the mass and @xmath4 dependence of single particle spectra in the soft sector may be understood almost entirely in terms of phase - space restriction with decreasing event multiplicity .    plotted in that figure",
    "is the ratio of spectra from low - multiplicity events over spectra from high - multiplicity events .",
    "experimental studies sometimes show this ratio s inverse , often called @xmath60  @xcite . while of course the same information is shown in both representations , we choose that of figure  [ fig : softratio ] for two reasons .",
    "the first is to emphasize the effects of emcics , the topic of this paper ; these are , generically , to suppress the particle yield at high energy and momentum , particularly for low - n final states .",
    "( in multiparticle distributions , they also generate measurable correlations  @xcite . )",
    "the second reason is to stress that we have been discussing spectra in the soft sector , whereas the ratio @xmath60 is generally studied at high @xmath4 . at large @xmath4",
    ", we expect that a purely emcic - based explanation of the multiplicity evolution of the spectra might break down , for two reasons .",
    "firstly , even if particles of all momenta shared phase - space statistically , our approximation of equation  [ eq : emcic2 ] is expected to break down for energies much above the average energy , as discussed in appendix  [ sec : applicabilityappendix ] .",
    "secondly , it is believed that the high-@xmath4 yield has a large pre - equilibrium component ; thus , high-@xmath4 particles might participate less in the statistical sharing of phase - space , as discussed in section  [ sec : postulatedetails ] .",
    "as we discuss in the next section , emcics surely do _ not _ dominate the multiplicity evolution of the hard sector in heavy ion collisions . for interpreting high-@xmath4 spectra from multiplicity - selected  collisions , accounting for emcics may or may not be important . in order to make the connection to figure  [ fig : softratio ] , we will plot spectra from low - multiplicity collisions over those from high - multiplicity , as well as the inverse , to make the connection to @xmath60 .",
    "the generic effect of emcics is to suppress particle yields at energy - momentum far from the average value .",
    "the effect is stronger for lower multiplicity @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear , then , that emcics can not account for the multiplicity evolution of the spectra at high @xmath4 in  collisions , since high - multiplicity collisions are observed to have _ more _ suppression at high @xmath4 than do low - multiplicity collisions  @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that our postulate fails for  collisions at high @xmath4 ; the `` parent distribution '' describing the underlying physics in this region does , indeed , change with multiplicity .",
    "but in  collisions , the multiplicity evolution in the hard sector is opposite to that in  collisions . in particular , in  collisions , the yield at high @xmath4 ( relative to lower @xmath4 ) is _ in_creased as multiplicity increases , as is clear from figure  [ fig : starnonidspectra ] ; similar results have been observed in @xmath61 collisions at the tevatron  @xcite , isr  @xcite , and sp@xmath62s  @xcite .",
    "a `` hardening '' of the spectrum with increasing multiplicity goes in the same direction as would emcic effects .",
    "to what extent can emcics account for the multiplicity evolution of spectra from  collisions , in the hard sector ?    , but plotted over the entire measured @xmath4 range .",
    "[ fig : nonidspectrafit],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    some insight on this question may be gained from figure  [ fig : nonidspectrafit ] , in which the data and curves shown in figure  [ fig : nonidspectrafitszoom ] are plotted out to @xmath63  gev / c .",
    "clearly , the calculated suppression function ( equation  [ eq : ratio ] ) fails dramatically at high @xmath4 .",
    "we recall that equations  [ eq : emcic2 ] and  [ eq : ratio ] are based on the central limit theorem ( clt ) , which naturally leads to gaussian distributions .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ sec : applicabilityappendix ] , one expects the breakdown of the clt approximation in the far tails of the distribution e.g. when @xmath64 .",
    "thus , any inferences we make about emcic effects in the hard sector remain qualitative .",
    "nevertheless , the level of disagreement between the calculations and measurements leads us to conclude that emcics do _ not _ fully explain the multiplicity evolution of @xmath4 spectra in  collisions in the hard sector .",
    "however , this , in itself , raises a fascinating possibility .",
    "figure  [ fig : nonidspectrafit ] shows that , relative to high - multiplicity  collisions , the suppression of high-@xmath4 yields from low - multiplicity collisions is not as strong as one expects from our simple postulate .",
    "said another way , the high-@xmath4 `` enhancement '' in high - multiplicity collisions may not be as large as one expects from phasespace considerations alone .",
    "this is emphasized in figure  [ fig : rpp ] , in which is plotted `` @xmath65 '' , the ratio of the spectrum from high - multiplicity to lower - multiplicity collisions ; @xmath65 is the analog of @xmath66 from heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for studying quantities like @xmath60 and @xmath66 ( and now @xmath65 ) is to identify important differences between one class of collisions and another .",
    "presumably , one is interested in physics effects ( jet quenching , etc .",
    ") , above and beyond `` trivial '' energy and momentum conservation .",
    "thus , it makes sense to attempt to `` correct '' for emcics by dividing them out as we did in section  [ sec : olga ] , keeping in mind the caveats just discussed .    , '' the analogue of `` @xmath66 '' used in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the spectrum from the highest - multiplicity  collisions are divided by spectra from lower - multiplicity collisions ( see filled datapoints in figure  [ fig : starnonidspectra ] ) .",
    "the data and curves are simply the inverse of those shown in figure  [ fig : nonidspectrafit ] .",
    "[ fig : rpp],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the result of this exercise is shown in figure  [ fig : emccorrectedrpp ] , in which the datapoints from figure  [ fig : rpp ] are divided by the curves from the same figure , to form a new quantity , @xmath67 .",
    "explicitly , the green circles on figure  [ fig : emccorrectedrpp ] , which compare multiplicity selections # 9 and # 4 are given by @xmath68 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the relevant quantities from table  [ tab : pp ] are used .",
    "again , all particles are assumed to have pion mass .",
    "qualitative though it is , figure  [ fig : emccorrectedrpp ] raises the possibility that , when `` trivial '' emcics are accounted for , the high-@xmath4 yield from high - multiplicity  collisions is _ suppressed _ relative to low - multiplicity collisions , a trend in the same direction as that observed in  collisions .    in the hard sector ,",
    "our estimates are mathematically and conceptually too simplistic to decide whether this implies `` jet quenching '' in high - multiplicity  collisions .",
    "however , it is quite clear that conservation - induced phasespace restrictions might be sufficiently large in the hard sector , so that a high-@xmath4 `` enhancement '' in high - multiplicity  collisions turns into a `` suppression , '' when these effects are accounted for . extracting physics messages",
    "( e.g. about mini - jet production or jet quenching ) from the multiplicity evolution of  spectra is a non - trivial task , in light of this potentially huge background effect . at the very least , emcics should not be ignored , as they usually are , when extracting physics messages .",
    "figure  [ fig : rpp ] ) divided by the emcic contribution to @xmath65 , as calculated by equation  [ eq : rppprime ] .",
    "[ fig : emccorrectedrpp],scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions is , by its very nature , heavily dependent on comparative systematics .",
    "physical models or hypotheses are most stringently tested when predictions for a given observable are compared to measurements for a range of global collision conditions . even aside from specific models ,",
    "much qualitative information may be gleaned simply through study of the evolution of an observable as collision conditions quantified by global variables change .    since the goal is to probe an interaction or transition characterized by a dimensionful scale ( confinement length @xmath69  fm ) ,",
    "perhaps the most important global variable is event multiplicity , which on average reflects the size of the system generated in the collision .",
    "directly measurable is the multiplicity evolution of experimental observables .",
    "this evolution is driven by ( 1 ) the evolution of the underlying physics which is of direct interest and ( 2 ) kinematic phase - space restrictions ( emcics) which are presumably less interesting .",
    "it may be hazardous to ignore the latter effect and make inferences on the former , particularly since phase - space restrictions have an obvious explicit multiplicity dependence . in this study",
    ", we have quantitatively estimated the degree to which phase - space restrictions may affect physics inferences based on measured data .",
    "we have focused on the multiplicity evolution of single particle spectra . in previous published studies , analyses which have ignored emcics have inferred much from this evolution . in particular ,",
    "there have been conclusions that spectra from central  collisions exhibit greater collective radial flow than do those from peripheral  or  collisions .",
    "using an expression to approximately account for emcic effects , we have shown that the multiplicity evolution of the spectra may be dominated by such effects , rather than any change in the underlying physics .",
    "in particular , we have tested the extreme postulate that the driving physics , characterized by a parent distribution , is _ identical _ for  collisions and  collisions of all centralities .",
    "since the parameters characterizing the parent distribution and the system multiplicity @xmath18 were fitted , our test is not perfect .",
    "some multiplicity evolution of the parent distribution itself may exist , and may not be easily separable from emcics .",
    "our point is that , with `` reasonable '' parameters , much of the data systematics is readily understood in terms of a universal parent distribution in the soft sector , and similar high-@xmath4 yield suppression in  and  collisions .    in the soft sector ( @xmath19  gev / c ) this postulate worked surprisingly well .",
    "the changes in @xmath70 distributions , as the collision multiplicity is changed , are almost entirely due to emcics .",
    "`` correcting '' the spectra for emcics , an approximate procedure along the lines of fermi s golden rule , reveals almost universal parent distributions .",
    "while the spectra themselves carry more information than fits to the spectra , it was interesting to find that blast - wave fits to the `` emcic - corrected '' spectra show that low multiplicity  collisions , and even  collisions , are characterized by very similar flow and temperature values as for spectra from  collisions .",
    "this contrasts strongly with previous conclusions and assumptions about collectivity in small systems .",
    "blast - wave  @xcite or modified blast - wave  @xcite fits which ignore emcics , may yield unreliable results for low - multiplicity final states .",
    "the same analysis of @xmath4 spectra of unidentified hadrons from multiplicity - selected  collisions yielded similar results , though the multiplicity evolution of the spectra was only roughly explained by our postulate .",
    "this is to be expected , for several reasons .",
    "firstly , our approximate expression to account for emcics was based on the central limit theorem , which begins to break down for the very small multiplicities involved .",
    "secondly , the lack of particle identification led to a simple assumption that all particles were pions .",
    "nevertheless , it was clear that emcics can go a long way towards explaining the multiplicity evolution of the @xmath4 spectra in the soft sector .",
    "emcic effects on momentum distributions are expected to be large at higher @xmath4 , where a single particle may consume much of the total available energy .",
    "however , the approximations behind our emcic factor should begin to break down at high @xmath4 . unlike our results in the soft sector",
    ", we would be on shaky ground to draw firm conclusions from our studies in the hard sector .",
    "nevertheless , we applied our formalism to obtain a rough estimate the magnitude of restricted phase - space effects at high @xmath4 .",
    "firstly , we immediately realized that the well - known `` high-@xmath4 suppression '' for central  collisions can not be explained by emcics , as these effects would cause the opposite behavior ( i.e. `` high-@xmath4 enhancement '' ) from what is experimentally observed .",
    "thus , our postulate fully breaks down at high @xmath4 there is a difference in the _ physics _",
    "( parent distribution ) in the hard sector .",
    "turning to the multiplicity - evolution of @xmath4 spectra from  collisions , however , the measured effect goes in the same direction as that expected from emcic effects . still keeping in mind the caveats behind our expression at high momentum",
    ", we estimated that the high-@xmath4 enhancement expected from emcics should be at least as large as that observed in the data .",
    "again , we do not conclude , but _",
    "suggest _ that the multiplicity - evolution of the parent distributions in  collisions might in fact reveal a high-@xmath4 suppression for high multiplicity collisions , reminiscent of the effect measured in heavy ion collisions .",
    "our results suggest that the multiplicity evolution of the soft portion of the @xmath4 spectra in collisions at rhic is dominated by phase - space restrictions .",
    "effects due to actual changes in physics ( the parent distribution ) are subdominant .",
    "this suggests one of two possibilities .",
    "firstly , one may take the common assumption that the physics underlying the soft particles from @xmath17 and  collisions is quite different , say bulk behavior versus string breaking , respectively . in this case",
    ", our results suggest that single - particle spectra are too insensitive to distinguish very different physics scenarios , and physics conclusions ( say , radial flow in @xmath17 collisions ) based on them are questionable .    on the other hand",
    ", the single - particle spectra may well reflect the underlying physics .",
    "if energy and momentum conservation effects are taken into account , the low-@xmath4 spectra indicate that  collisions display as much collective radial flow as do  collisions . in the larger system , this collective behavior is usually considered to arise from a ( perhaps only partially ) thermalized _ bulk _ system .",
    "the question naturally arises : is nt it impossible for a system as small as that created in a  collision to form even a partially thermalized bulk system which develops flow ?",
    "the answer is not obvious .",
    "after all , estimates set the timescale for _ complete _ thermalization in central  collisions below 1  fm / c  @xcite , via a mechanism that may be driven more by fluctuating color fields than by classical rescattering processes  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , and references therein ) .",
    "perhaps the possibility that similar processes have sufficient time to thermalize a system on the scale of @xmath69  fm should not be dismissed out of hand .",
    "indeed , in the literature one finds frequent suggestions  @xcite , based on single - particle spectra , that high energy particle collisions generate flowing bulk systems and perhaps even quark - gluon plasma ; see also the recent review by weiner  @xcite . by partially removing the obscuring effects of emcics ,",
    "we have more directly compared proton collisions to heavy ion collisions ( at the same energy and measured with the same detector ) , for which a flow - based interpretation is generally well accepted .",
    "if a bulk system _ is _ created in  collisions , might it `` quench '' jets as the medium does in  collisions ?",
    "this was , after all , the original proposition of bjorken  @xcite .",
    "the signature of such quenching would be a suppression of particle yields at high @xmath4 in high - multiplicity collisions , relative to those at lower multiplicity .",
    "while our formalism is insufficiently reliable at high @xmath4 to draw firm quantitative conclusions , such a suppression may possibly be present , though obscured by emcics in measured spectra .    increased focus on the relationship between large and small systems created in ultrarelativistic collisions is called for .",
    "experimental programs at the large hadron collider will very soon open up important avenues in this study .",
    "in particular , the experiments will measure first  collisions at record collision energies , with event multiplicities similar to @xmath6 or semi - peripheral  collisions at rhic .",
    "soft sector @xmath4 distributions will likely be among the first observations reported .",
    "later , with identical acceptance and techniques , the same experiments will then measure much larger systems created in @xmath71 collisions .",
    "the direct comparison afforded by this data should help answer the question of whether a bulk system created in hadronic collisions is qualitatively different than that created in collisions between the heaviest ions , or merely a smaller version of it .",
    "the nature of relativistic heavy ion studies depends upon comparison of `` small '' and `` large '' collision systems , each of which may be driven by distinct , non - trivial physics processes . in performing such comparisons",
    ", we must not neglect the `` trivial '' effect of energy and momentum conservation , and its explicit dependence on collision size .",

    "[ eq : emcic2 ] through an appeal to the central limit theorem .",
    "discrepancies between the exact expression and the approximate gaussian functional form will become more apparent in the tails of the distribution .",
    "for example , our approximate phase space suppression function never vanishes , thus permitting a tiny but finite probability for a particle to carry more energy than that of the entire system ! in this appendix , we perform simple numerical calculations with the genbod  computer program  @xcite , to estimate the range of quantitative reliability of equation  [ eq : emcic2 ] .",
