    "cloud computing is a large scale network - based distributed computing environment where computing resources such as memory , processing power , bandwidth , etc .",

    "the cloud computing environment comprises of many models such as _ software as a service ( saas ) _ , _ platform as a service ( paas ) _ and _ infrastructure as a service ( iaas)_. these models are made available to the users through virtualization techniques .",
    "the users demands are satisfied by a set of servers hosted on virtual machines ( vms ) .",
    "the vms utilize the resources of underlying physical machines ( pms ) or nodes provided and operated by organizations called ` cloud providers ' .",
    "some examples of cloud providers include amazon ec2  @xcite , gogrid  @xcite and rackspace cloud  @xcite .",
    "adopting the use of virtual machines ( vms ) in such large - scale environments enhances the number of available servers through multiple os instances on a single node , thereby achieving efficient hardware utilization .",
    "however , there may be a number of underutilized nodes due to the inefficient mapping of virtual machines to physical machines . minimizing the number of physical machines utilized helps in cutting down the power consumption drastically  @xcite .",
    "the placement algorithm for vms in a data center allocates various resources such as memory , bandwidth , processing power , etc . from a physical machine ( pm )",
    "to vms such that the number of pms used is minimized .",
    "this problem can be viewed as a multi - dimensional packing problem  @xcite ( figure [ fig : vbp ] ) .",
    "the resource requests of vms are considered as @xmath0-dimensional vectors with non - negative entries ( balls ) .",
    "the resource available at each pm is considered to be a @xmath0-dimensional vector ( each dimension signifies an independent resource ) with a magnitude of 1 along each dimension ( bins ) .",
    "the goal is to minimize the number of bins such that for every bin the sum of the vectors placed in that bin is coordinate - wise no greater than the bin s vector .",
    "thus , the resource allocation problem is an instance of the @xmath0-dimensional vector bin packing problem ( vbp )  @xcite .    for d = 1 , the vbp is identical to the 1-dimensional bin packing problem .",

    "the number of bins @xmath25 can initially be set to a sufficiently large value arrived at by any heuristic ( example - de la vega and leuker  @xcite give a @xmath26-@xmath12 bound on the number of bins ) .",
    "then , we formulate the integer program ( ilp ) as follows -    @xmath27    the notations are mentioned in figure [ nottab ]",
    ". the constraints of the ilp are as follows -    * constraint ( 2 ) states that every vector is packed in a bin . * constraint ( 3 ) ensures that the packed vectors do not exceed the bin dimensions .",
    "* constraint ( 4 ) tells whether a bin is used or not . *",
    "constraint ( 5 ) ensures that a vector is either packed entirely in a bin or not .",
    "constraint ( 5 ) can be relaxed as follows to obtain a linear program ( lp ) .",
    "@xmath28 we can obtain a feasible solution for the lp using any standard method  @xcite . using binary search technique ,",
    "we can also find the least value of @xmath25 , @xmath29 for the relaxed ilp for which a feasible solution exists .",
    "the value of @xmath30 thus obtained will be less than the optimal solution for the integer program i.e. ( @xmath31 @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , the solution obtained is usually not integral . to tackle this problem",
    ", we formulate a dual - maximization problem  @xcite for the above relaxed ilp .",
    "we introduce several new variables @xmath32 to formulate the dual .",
    "the dual - maximization problem formulation is given in the appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "we arrive at the following set of equations and constraints - + @xmath33    this is a nonlinear program ( nlp ) as the objective function is nonlinear .",
    "hereafter , we shall refer to it as nlp .",
    "the number of variables in the nlp can be reduced by performing the following substitutions for the value of @xmath32 s .",
    "[ th:5 ] the optimal solution to the nlp will still be optimal when the value of @xmath32 is replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "proof.from the jensen s inequality , we have that if @xmath35 is a convex function ( `` concave - up '' ) on an interval @xmath36 and @xmath37 then for weights @xmath38 summing to 1 - @xmath39 we can apply jensen s inequality with @xmath38 and @xmath40 corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the modified set of equations in this case is as follows- @xmath41 from the property of convex functions , we have - @xmath42 from ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) , we have - @xmath43 since @xmath44 is a convex function , any value which maximizes @xmath45 also maximizes @xmath44 and vice - versa .",
    "hence , from the inequality ( [ eq : c ] ) , we have that the term @xmath46 should be maximized for the objective function to be maximized .",
    "indirectly , @xmath32 has to be maximized relative to the values of @xmath18 .",
    "the value of @xmath32 is constrained by the constraint ( [ cons9 ] ) , and hence we come up with the following tight function for @xmath32 - @xmath47    ' '' ''    -1000    since @xmath48 , the value of @xmath49 for an appropriately chosen value @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the objective function can be reduced to a quadratic term .    from ( [ eq:11 ] ) ,",
    "the nlp now becomes - @xmath50    the optimal solution to the above modified nlp - nlp@xmath51 - must be necessarily integral ( follows from theorem [ th:5 ] ) . in this light , we now present our algorithms which will provide the ( near-)optimal integer solution .",

    "the main idea is to harness the polynomial - time solvability of linear and quadratic programming techniques .",
