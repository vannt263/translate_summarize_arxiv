    "the proton is a complex composite object in which sea - quarks and gluons make significant contribution to the structure functions .",
    "investigation of the strange structure of the nucleon is currently of great interest since strange quarks appear only as sea quarks in most models of the nucleon in contrast to the light quarks ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) that appear as both valence and sea quarks .    an important experimental approach to study",
    "the role of strange quarks in the proton s wave function is to measure the relative production of @xmath1 and @xmath0 vector mesons .",
    "since the singlet - octet mixing angle of the ground state vector meson nonet is close to the ideal value ( i.e. @xmath10 )  @xcite , the @xmath0 meson consists almost completely of light valence quarks and the @xmath1 meson almost completely of strange valence quarks . according to the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule ,",
    "processes with disconnected quark lines in the initial or final state are suppressed  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the production of the @xmath1 meson is expected to be strongly suppressed relative to the @xmath0 meson in hadronic reactions with no strange quarks in the initial state . under the assumption that the ozi rule is exactly fulfilled , the @xmath1 meson can only be produced by the small admixture of light quarks to its wave function .",
    "thus , the relative production cross sections for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons ( @xmath11 ) can be calculated by the following formula : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a correction for the available phase space , and @xmath14 is the deviation from the ideal mixing angle  @xcite .    in certain hadronic reactions it has been observed that the ratio of the exclusive cross sections for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 meson production reactions significantly exceeds estimates based on simple quark models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for @xmath6 annihilation at rest this enhancement",
    "is observed to be particularly dramatic  @xcite .",
    "this apparent violation of the ozi rule has been interpreted as evidence for a non - negligible negatively polarized @xmath15 fock component to the proton s wave function  @xcite .",
    "here it is important to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon sea  @xcite , since other explanations stress the importance of higher order rescattering processes  @xcite , thereby `` avoiding '' the ozi rule .",
    "recently , there have been numerous experimental investigations on the contribution of strange quarks to the proton : at low momentum transfers @xmath16 there are measurements of parity violating polarized electron - proton scattering to determine the strange electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "first results indicate very small effects  @xcite , and thus the scale of the strange vector current @xmath17 can not yet be determined ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "spin dependent structure functions have also been measured in a number of inclusive  @xcite and semi - inclusive  @xcite experiments on deep inelastic scattering of polarized leptons from nucleons , suggesting that the strange sea quarks are weakly polarized against the proton helicity .",
    "furthermore , it has commonly been discussed that the magnitude of the @xmath18 term in low energy pion nucleon elastic scattering  @xcite indicates a possibly sizable , but very uncertain scalar density of strange sea quarks @xmath19 in the nucleon s wave function .",
    "the negatively polarized intrinsic strangeness model was in part motivated by the strong correlation of the @xmath1 meson yield to the spin triplet fraction of the annihilating @xmath20 system  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 meson production in @xmath21 reactions at threshold must proceed via the spin triplet entrance channel , further insight on the origin of the enhanced @xmath1 production in @xmath20 could be provided by studying near - threshold @xmath21 reactions , where predictions based upon the strange sea quarks in the nucleon and meson rescattering models might be expected to differ .    to address this problem",
    "we have measured the production of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons in proton - proton reactions with the disto spectrometer  @xcite at the saturne accelerator in saclay .",
    "we present here total and differential cross sections that were determined for a beam momentum of @xmath22  gev / c which corresponds to a much lower available energy above the @xmath1 production threshold ( @xmath23  mev ) than the existing data ( @xmath24  gev )  @xcite . in previous letters  @xcite",
    "we have presented the first results close to the @xmath1 meson production threshold in proton - proton reactions , where it was determined that the @xmath3 cross section ratio increases slightly toward threshold . since these publications we have made several improvements to the data analysis , including refinements of the acceptance correction , improvements in the tracking algorithm and calibrations , as well as the analysis of a factor four more statistics .",
    "these results are presented here in more detail , together with differential cross section distributions that were previously not available .",
    "all of the previously published data are consistent with the results presented here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section experimental details of the detector and data analysis are presented .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 and @xmath0 meson total and differential cross sections are presented in the ensuing section , followed by a discussion of these results and a summary .",
    "a proton beam from the saturne synchrotron with momentum @xmath2  gev / c was directed onto a liquid hydrogen target of 2  cm length , and multiple charge particle final states were measured with the disto spectrometer  @xcite , which is shown schematically in figure  [ fig : disto ] .",
    "charged particles were tracked through a magnetic spectrometer and detected by a scintillator hodoscope and an array of water erenkov detectors .",
    "the magnetic spectrometer consisted of a dipole magnet ( 1.0  t@xmath25 m ) , 2 sets of scintillating fiber hodoscopes inside the field , and 2 sets of multi wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) outside the field .",
    "the large acceptance of the spectrometer ( @xmath26 vertical , @xmath27 horizontal ) allowed for coincident detection of four charged particles , which was essential for the kinematically complete reconstruction of many final states ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) . particle identification and 4-momentum conservation served as powerful tools for background rejection .",
    "event readout was triggered by a multiplicity condition on the scintillating fiber and hodoscope detectors , selecting events with at least three charged particles .",
    "details of the experimental apparatus can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the exclusive reactions @xmath33 and @xmath34 were identified via the @xmath35 decay of the @xmath36 and @xmath0 mesons with partial widths @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively  @xcite . for the @xmath39 reaction ,",
    "the @xmath1 was observed via its @xmath40 decay with @xmath41 .",
    "since these channels all have four charged particles in the final state ( three positive and one negative ) , these events could be reconstructed by applying particle identification and kinematical constraints on an event - by - event basis to the same sample of four track events .",
    "after calibration , the data from the magnetic spectrometer consist of a collection of points in space determined by the various detector components .",
    "thus , the first major step in the data analysis is to determine the trajectories of the charged particles from the detector position information . in general , a particle s trajectory is defined by 5 independent parameters .",
    "these parameters can be chosen in numerous ways , however they must span the space of allowed possibilities .",
    "the choice of track parameters used in this experiment to define the trajectories was motivated by the dipole magnetic field geometry , and was based on a right handed coordinate system with its origin in the center of the target , @xmath42 in the beam direction at the target , and @xmath43 ( vertical ) along the magnetic field direction .",
    "the five track parameters used were @xmath44 and @xmath45 to describe the intersection of the track with the @xmath46 plane through the origin , @xmath1 to describe the angle of the track s projection onto the @xmath47 plane at the point @xmath48 , @xmath49 to describe the ratio of the particle s momentum along @xmath43 to the momentum in the @xmath47 plane , and @xmath50 for the reciprocal of the momentum in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "the observed positions in the detectors can be calculated as a function of these five parameters by detailed monte - carlo simulations of the detector performance .",
    "the goal of the tracking algorithm is to invert this function , i.e. determine the track parameters from the measured position information .",
    "this is done in a two step procedure : in the first step ( track - search ) it is determined which hits belong together to form a track .",
    "then , in the track - fit procedure the five track parameters are determined from the hits in an iterative , quasi - newton procedure by interpolating within a matrix of reference trajectories .",
    "particle identification was achieved using the light output from the water erenkov detectors , which provided good @xmath51 - proton separation spanning a wide range of momenta , as well as @xmath52 identification in a restricted range above the kaon erenkov threshold @xmath53 .",
    "water was chosen as the erenkov radiator ( @xmath54 , @xmath55  mev / c ) in order to match the momentum range of the kaons from the reaction @xmath56 , which are distributed around 700  mev / c .",
    "the inclusive correlation of erenkov amplitude versus momentum is shown in figures  [ fig : cerenkov]a and [ fig : cerenkov]c for negatively and positively curved tracks , respectively .",
    "these figures have a logarithmic intensity scale with a factor 2.4 between intensity contours . in figure",
    "[ fig : cerenkov]a there is a clear band from the @xmath57 mesons",
    ". the @xmath58 mesons are not visible in this inclusive distribution because of the @xmath59 larger pion yield . on the other hand",
    ", there is already a weak indication of the @xmath60 mesons in figure  [ fig : cerenkov]c in addition to the prominent @xmath51 meson and proton lines .",
    "the relative yield of a given kaon species can be enhanced by imposing two requirements on the data set : the first is that the oppositely charged meson is consistent with being a kaon , and the second is 4-momentum conservation for the given event hypothesis ( i.e. @xmath56 ) .",
    "the remaining yield after imposing these restrictions is shown in figures  [ fig : cerenkov]b and [ fig : cerenkov]d , where signals from the @xmath60 and @xmath58 mesons are now clearly visible .",
    "the data sample analyzed here with four charged particles contained events from many different types of reactions .",
    "the individual reactions were identified by a combination of particle identification of the charged particles in the final state and kinematic constraints on the measured particles .",
    "the charged particles in the final state , predominantly protons , pions , and kaons , were identified with the water erenkov detectors as described above . however , since the same final state could be produced via several reaction channels , kinematic conditions were required to discriminate among the particular reaction channels .",
    "all reaction channels studied here contained at most one unmeasured particle in the final state , thus the measured four track events were kinematically complete . as a result 4-momentum conservation was imposed as a powerful constraint to select events of a given hypothesis .",
    "for this the invariant mass and missing mass of various particle configurations were calculated : the invariant mass ( @xmath61 ) is the total energy in the reference frame of a given number of observed particles .",
    "@xmath61 can be calculated from the total energies ( @xmath62 ) and momenta ( @xmath63 ) of the @xmath64 individual particles using the following formula : @xmath65 the missing mass analysis was used to determine the rest mass of an unobserved recoil particle . the missing mass ( @xmath66 )",
    "is given by the following formula : @xmath67 where the index @xmath68 runs over all @xmath49 observed particles .",
    "the specific application of these constraints is discussed in the following sections .",
    "the results presented here on the production of the @xmath1 meson were determined by selecting events of the type @xmath56 . for this event hypothesis ,",
    "the proton - proton missing mass ( @xmath69 ) must equal the invariant mass of the kaon pair ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "since all four particles in the final state have been measured , the event reconstruction has been performed requiring that the four particle missing mass ( @xmath71 ) be equal to zero .",
    "the distribution of @xmath72 is plotted in figure  [ fig : miss - inv ] including kaon identification ( solid histogram ) based on the erenkov detectors .",
    "the peak at @xmath73 results from events consistent with the @xmath56 hypothesis , and is superimposed on a background resulting from imperfect @xmath74 separation in the erenkov detectors in a small fraction of events of the type @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "the dashed histogram is an estimate of the background by scaling the inclusive distribution without kaon erenkov requirements by a factor 0.002 in order to match the data in figure  [ fig : miss - inv ] above @xmath77gev@xmath78c@xmath79 .",
    "the background from non @xmath30 final states comprises only about 2.2% of the yield in the range @xmath80 gev@xmath81/c@xmath79 , which marks the range where events were accepted for the further analysis .",
    "the exclusive reaction channel @xmath82 was measured via the @xmath83 decay and was selected by a missing mass analysis since the @xmath84 decays primarily into two photons ( @xmath85 ) which are not detected in the spectrometer .",
    "events of the type @xmath86 were selected by first requiring that the erenkov amplitudes associated with the four charged tracks be consistent with the hypothesis @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , background from four body reactions of the type @xmath28 with @xmath87 is partially suppressed by requiring the invariant mass of the pion pair to fulfill @xmath88 .",
    "after these requirements , the distribution of the four particle missing mass squared @xmath89 versus the proton - proton missing mass @xmath90 is shown in figure  [ fig : om_eta ] with a linear scale for the intensity contours . as seen in this figure",
    ", there is a very strong signal for the @xmath91 reaction at @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the projection of this distribution onto the @xmath90 axis is shown in the lower frame of figure  [ fig : om_eta ] with the additional requirement that @xmath94 . in this figure",
    ", there are clear peaks from the @xmath35 decay of the @xmath36 and @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the structure at very low @xmath90 is due to contamination of four body events of the type @xmath28 .",
    "the relative acceptance of the apparatus for the @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath30 production channels has been evaluated by means of monte carlo simulations , which after digitization , were processed through the same analysis chain as the measured data . the relative acceptance could be determined independent of the actual phase space distribution of the particles in the final state , because the following two requirements are fulfilled with the disto spectrometer : ( i ) the detector acceptance was determined as a function of all relevant degrees of freedom in the final state , and ( ii ) after accounting for the azimuthal and reflection symmetries , the detector acceptance was non - zero over the full kinematically allowed region .    in order to determine the detector acceptance ,",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom were each subdivided into a specific number of bins , thus defining a multi - dimensional matrix .",
    "next , the number of both the generated and the reconstructed events from the simulations were stored in separate copies of this matrix . finally , the bin - by - bin ratio of the number of generated to the number of reconstructed events provided the efficiency correction matrix .    when analyzing the data the acceptance correction procedure was performed on an event - by - event basis by first determining the phase space bin of the particular event and then incrementing the distributions by the corresponding acceptance correction factor from the acceptance correction matrix described below .",
    "these correction factors include the appropriate partial widths and the simulations account for the lifetime and different decay modes of all unstable particles involved .",
    "although there are in general 16 degrees of freedom for 4 particles in the final state , numerous constraints exist which significantly lower the total number of independent degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , particle identification and 4-momentum conservation reduce the number of degrees of freedom to 8 for the @xmath97 final state .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom can be parameterized in numerous ways , with the only restriction that the variables chosen must span the space of allowed possibilities .    without loss of generality",
    "the eight kinematic degrees of freedom for the @xmath30 final state can be parameterized as if the reaction proceeded in two steps , i.e. @xmath98 . in this case",
    ", five variables can be used to describe the three body system @xmath99 , and the remaining three degrees of freedom are then required to uniquely determine the decay of the intermediate state @xmath44 .",
    "this choice of kinematic variables provides a complete basis and does not require that the reaction actually proceeds via the intermediate state @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath99 system is parameterized by the two invariant mass combinations @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( i.e. dalitz plot variables of the @xmath99 system ) , and three euler angles to describe the orientation of the @xmath99 decay plane in the center of mass reference frame ( cm ) : the polar and azimuthal angles of the @xmath44 intermediate state @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and a rotation of the @xmath99 decay plane around the direction of @xmath44 , @xmath104 . furthermore",
    ", three variables are required to describe the decay of @xmath44 : the mass @xmath105 , and the emission angles of one of the kaons in the @xmath44 reference frame @xmath106 and @xmath107 where these angles are measured relative to the beam direction corresponds to polar angles measured with respect to the beam axis , and @xmath108 corresponds to polar angles measured with respect to any other quantization axis , which will be explicitly stated .",
    "azimuthal angles are labeled by @xmath1 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "the subscript denotes the reference frame in which the angle in measured , and the superscript denotes the particle being measured . ] .",
    "the beam direction is chosen as the reference direction for the @xmath44 decay to facilitate comparison in sec .",
    "[ ssec : k+k- ] with simple expectations for @xmath1-meson decay when it is produced near threshold in @xmath21 reactions .",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath44 production must be isotropic as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , in the simulations @xmath103 has been integrated with an isotropic distribution to determine the detector acceptance as a function of the remaining seven degrees of freedom .    due to the high dimensionality of this problem , even a small number of bins per kinematic variable result in an acceptance correction matrix that is too large to calculate with the available computational facilities . for a subdivision of each degree of freedom into @xmath110 bins , and an average of @xmath111 events simulated per bin of the acceptance matrix",
    ", a total of @xmath112 would have to be simulated .",
    "thus , in order to explore the dependence of the detector acceptance on the remaining seven kinematic variables , two subsets of the general acceptance correction matrix ( matrix a and matrix b ) have been generated by integrating over several of the kinematic variables as discussed below and summarized in table  [ tab : kinvarphietaom ] .",
    "the simulations for matrix a contain two simplifications in order to make the calculations tractable .",
    "the first simplification is the requirement that the mass of the intermediate state @xmath44 be equal to the @xmath1 meson mass .",
    "of course this requirement restricts the use of matrix a to the @xmath113 reaction only ; however , little systematic error is introduced because the shape of the mass distribution of the @xmath1 meson is well known and the detector acceptance varies little over it .",
    "furthermore , an isotropic angular distribution of the differential cross - section for @xmath1 meson production versus @xmath114 has been assumed for matrix a. this assumption is consistent with the observation that this angular distribution turns out to be isotropic when matrix b ( see below ) , which includes explicitly the @xmath102 dependence , is used for the acceptance correction .",
    "therefore , in the simulations to calculate matrix a , the intermediate state @xmath44 was given the @xmath1 meson mass and the angular variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 were integrated over with isotropic distributions when determining the acceptance as a function of the remaining five variables .    in order to overcome the restrictions on the usage of the acceptance correction matrix",
    "a mentioned above , the available degrees of freedom in the @xmath30 final state were subdivided differently , as listed in table  [ tab : kinvarphietaom ] , resulting in the acceptance correction matrix b. here the variables @xmath70 and @xmath102 were explicitly included in matrix b. however , an isotropic distribution for the decay @xmath115 was used in order to reduce the dimensionality of the matrix to a solvable level .",
    "the validity of using an isotropic decay of @xmath115 can be judged by the data presented in sec .",
    "[ ssec : k+k- ] using matrix a. furthermore , the variables @xmath116 and @xmath117 were integrated over with a weighting according to three body phase space .",
    "this was motivated by the observation that the physical distributions show only small deviations from isotropy and double checked to give consistent results with a different generator for the @xmath99 system .      for the measurements of the @xmath36 and @xmath0 meson production",
    "there are 5 particles in the final state of each channel observed .",
    "the 20 degrees of freedom associated with 5 particles are reduced to 12 because of 4-momentum conservation and four particles have been identified .",
    "two further degrees of freedom are eliminated by requiring @xmath119 , respectively , and @xmath120 . of the remaining 10 degrees of freedom ,",
    "five are related to the @xmath99 system where @xmath121 and five to the corresponding decay @xmath122 .",
    "the @xmath99 system is parameterized by the dalitz plot variables @xmath100 and @xmath101 , as well as three euler angles to describe the orientation of the @xmath99 decay plane : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . as discussed above ,",
    "the differential cross section is isotropic in @xmath103 , thus there are in effect 4 independent degrees of freedom plus those associated with the decay of the meson @xmath44 .",
    "the matrix element associated with the @xmath123 decay was taken from  @xcite and verified to be consistent with the data from  @xcite , thus allowing the corresponding variables to be integrated over . the matrix element for the @xmath36 decay",
    "was taken from @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed an isotropic orientation of the @xmath0 decay plane , which was verified to be consistent with the data .",
    "thus , four dimensional efficiency matrices were calculated for the @xmath36 and @xmath0 production reactions , as summarized in table  [ tab : kinvarphietaom ] .",
    "although all bins that are kinematically allowed have a finite acceptance , there are some phase space bins with very low acceptance .",
    "these bins are associated with backward emission of the @xmath36 or @xmath0 meson ( in the cm frame ) .",
    "because the initial system involves two identical particles , the physical distribution must have a symmetry about @xmath124 .",
    "thus , in order to reduce the systematic error associated with the very large acceptance corrections at backward angles , all integrated cross section results for the @xmath36 and @xmath0 meson production were calculated for the forward hemisphere only ( and then multiplied by two ) .",
    "the differential cross sections however could be extended to backward angles , up to the limits of where the acceptance correction method remained valid , thereby providing an additional check of the calculations .",
    "the absolute cross section normalization was determined by measuring the yield of a given channel relative to that of a _ simultaneously _ measured channel with known cross section . this method to determine the absolute normalization",
    "was chosen because it reduced the large systematic uncertainty associated with the absolute calibrations of both beam intensity and trigger efficiency .",
    "for this work the reference channel was the reaction @xmath33 , for which a large amount of existing data @xcite are summarized in the upper frame of figure  [ fig : eta_omega_xc ] .    in order to provide the absolute cross section calibration ,",
    "the existing published data were interpolated to estimate the @xmath36 production cross - section at the beam momentum of the present measurement .",
    "the solid and dashed curves presented in the upper frame of figure  [ fig : eta_omega_xc ] correspond to two different parameterizations of the measured cross section values .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to a polynomial of sixth order and the dashed curve corresponds to a parameterization of the following form : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the cm energy at the @xmath36 meson production threshold , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 are free parameters .",
    "the vertical dotted line marks the available energy ( @xmath129  gev ) of this measurement .",

    "this discrepancy has been neglected since that measurement  @xcite is subject to a large systematic error associated with a quite substantial background subtraction .",
    "the average of these two interpolations at @xmath129  gev is our estimate of @xmath134b for the total cross section of the reaction @xmath33 at our beam momentum .",
    "the systematic error from the absolute normalization ( @xmath135 ) is determined from the range of the parameterizations and is similar to or smaller than the systematic error from the combination of all other sources ( i.e. 32% for the @xmath136 ratio , see table  [ tab : uncert ] ) .",
    "furthermore , our estimate is in good agreement with one boson exchange model calculations by vetter et al .",
    "@xcite , who predict @xmath137b at this energy .      due to the large amount of data collected , the statistical errors are relatively small , and the experimental error is dominated by systematic uncertainty and systematic bias .",

    "systematic uncertainty of the results quoted here have been studied in detail for the following effects :    * for the acceptance corrections , the statistical uncertainty of the simulations has been studied by comparing the reconstructed particle ratios using acceptance correction matrices based on different subsets of the simulated data .",
    "furthermore , effects due to the finite binning of the kinematic variables , as well as the finite detector resolution have been considered . moreover , an additional cross check of the acceptance corrections was provided by the observation that the total @xmath1 meson yield is identical ( within the error range ) when determined using both acceptance correction matrices a and b. * a significant source of uncertainty is related to the meson yield determination ( back- ground subtraction and peak shape parameterization ) .",
    "this effect was studied by varying the parameterization of the line shapes and background , as well as by varying the fit ranges . *",
    "the four track trigger used to record the data presented here had a slightly different efficiency for @xmath28 and @xmath30 events .",
    "although this effect has been corrected for , as discussed below , effects such as noise and cross - talk in the multi - anode photomultipliers used for readout of the scintillating fiber detectors introduce an uncertainty to the magnitude of this correction , which we denote as  trigger bias \" . *",
    "similarly , the tracking efficiency of the data analysis procedure may vary slightly between measured and simulated data , primarily due to uncertainty of the actual wire chamber efficiency .",
    "in particular , the single track efficiency and correlated efficiency losses due to small spatial separation between tracks have been studied in detail .",
    "* since the data presented here were collected over an extended period of time , residual efficiency losses due to long term drifts in the calibration of the electronics may remain .",

    "the total systematic uncertainty quoted is determined by quadratically adding the individual terms applicable for a given measured cross section ratio .",
    "in addition to the systematic uncertainty , several effects lead to a systematic bias of the calculated cross section ratios . to estimate the magnitude of the systematic bias",
    "we have examined the following effects .    *",
    "the liquid hydrogen target was contained in a vessel in which background reactions were produced .",
    "these `` non - target '' events could be well separated by the vertex location in those events with complete scintillating fiber information . since this separation was not possible in the remaining @xmath138 50% of the events , the relative contamination determined in those events with full fiber information",
    "was subtracted from the complete data sample . *",
    "the data collection trigger required that three of the four charged particles must be observed in the scintillating fiber detectors . since the fiber detectors had a different response for minimum ionizing pions compared to kaons , which were slower , the trigger efficiency was higher for @xmath30 events than for @xmath139 events .",
    "the variation of the fiber efficiency has been studied as a function of particle velocity .",
    "the magnitude of the trigger bias was thus determined by combining the average kaon and pion efficiencies with the `` three of four '' trigger condition and an estimate of the cross talk in the fiber detectors . * finally , in the data analysis",
    ", conditions were placed on the v cerenkov amplitude of the individual tracks , as well as on several kinematical quantities .",
    "the efficiency with which a particular event type is accepted by all these conditions is strongly related to the detector resolution , which may be imperfectly modeled in the simulations , leading to a bias in the efficiency correction matrices .",
    "the magnitude of this effect was examined for each meson production reaction by comparing the acceptance loss from each individual selection criterion in the data to the simulations .",
    "the individual contributions to the systematic bias are summarized in table  [ tab : bias ] as the factor by which they modify the given particle cross section ratio .",
    "based on these considerations , the reconstructed @xmath140 , @xmath136 , and @xmath141 cross section ratios have been multiplied by the factors 0.97 , 0.98 , and 1.02 , respectively , to account for the systematic bias .",
    "the correction factor for the total @xmath142 cross section ratio is the same as for the @xmath136 ratio .",
    "after full acceptance corrections , the relative yields for exclusive @xmath143 , and @xmath1 meson production in proton - proton reactions at 3.67  gev / c have been determined .",

    "nevertheless , the large decay width @xmath223 violates the ozi rule itself and requires kaon loop diagrams for a quantitative explanation  @xcite .",
    "thus , all these solutions require a dominant role of intermediate states with open strangeness , thereby indicating that there must indeed be a significant amount of strange sea quarks available in reactions involving protons .",
    "ellis et al .",
    "claim that the enhanced @xmath1 meson production observed in @xmath224 reactions proceeds dominantly through the `` rearrangement '' process  @xcite . to a large degree",
    "this is based on the observation that the enhanced @xmath1 yield is strongly correlated to the initial spin triplet state in @xmath20 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "recent results on @xmath225 annihilation in flight  @xcite and @xmath226 pontecorvo reactions  @xcite support this hypothesis . according to their model ,",
    "the `` shake - out '' process should not depend upon the initial spin state , and the `` rearrangement '' process should dominantly occur in the spin triplet state for polarized strange sea quarks , in agreement with the data . following this argumentation ,",
    "@xmath1 meson production in proton - proton reactions is also expected to be strongly correlated with the spin triplet initial state .",
    "directly at threshold , the proton - proton entrance channel must be in a @xmath7 state due to parity and angular momentum conservation , and consequently , the spin of the @xmath1 meson is aligned along the beam axis . at @xmath170",
    "mev we observe the spin density matrix element @xmath206 to have a large deviation from the threshold prediction .",
    "this deviation is in qualitative agreement with the dilution of the spin alignment expected due to the observed contribution of the @xmath175 partial wave in the exit channel , and suggests that a significant fraction of the @xmath1 meson production at this beam momentum proceeds via the spin singlet @xmath194 and @xmath227 entrance channels .",
    "in this paper total and differential cross section values for the production of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons in proton - proton reactions at 3.67  gev / c are presented . the total cross section ratio for these mesons is observed to be about an order of magnitude larger than expected from predictions based on a naive application of the ozi rule .",
    "this enhancement is slightly larger than the data measured at higher beam momenta , however significant uncertainty remains regarding the relative contributions of different partial waves to the @xmath1 versus @xmath0 production processes .",
    "apparent violations of the ozi rule in @xmath6 reactions have sometimes been attributed to a significant contribution of intrinsic strangeness to the proton s wave function . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the observed enhancement of the @xmath1 meson yield in @xmath6 annihilation can be explained in terms of rescattering and loop diagrams .",
    "however , the large @xmath228 coupling also requires kaon loops , and thus the intermediate states are dominated by hadrons with strange quark content .",
    "therefore , both interpretations involve a significant contribution of strange sea quarks to hadronic reactions involving protons .",
    "further information to help determine the origin of the strange sea quarks can be taken from polarization observables .",
    "for instance , based on a dominance of the rearrangement process , the polarized intrinsic strange sea quarks prefer a spin triplet initial state for @xmath1 meson production .",
    "the differential cross sections presented in this report indicate that the proton - proton entrance channel is not in a pure @xmath7 state at the beam momentum of 3.67  gev / c .",
    "if the polarized intrinsic strangeness model is correct , then the @xmath3 ratio should increase in direct proportion to the fraction of spin triplet in the initial state .",
    "thus , it would be very useful to follow the correlation of the @xmath3 ratio to the spin triplet fraction as a function of beam momentum closer to threshold where the triplet fraction must rise .",
    "another sensitive test of the intrinsic strangeness model would be to determine the @xmath1 meson production cross section in proton - neutron reactions .",
    "for instance , based on the intrinsic strangeness model , ellis et al .",
    "predict the cross section ratio to be @xmath229 near threshold  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , meson exchange models  @xcite predict @xmath230 near threshold .",
    "finally , it would also be very important to determine the @xmath0 meson yield and partial wave contributions at the same excess energy relative to the threshold as presented here for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the angular distributions closer to threshold are needed to disentangle the mechanisms involved in the @xmath0 meson production  @xcite , and this would eliminate the uncertainty related to the relative contributions of the different partial waves in the @xmath96 and @xmath113 systems .",
    "in this section the differential cross sections presented in the figures above are listed in tables  [ tab : omegathetacm ] , [ tab:11070 ] , and [ tab : phicmmom ] .",
