    "recent experiments have shown that a binary liquid mixture of linear or ",
    "normal \" alkane and methanol in equilibrium with their common vapour displays a first - order wetting transition if the wetting temperature @xmath2 is well below the consolute - point temperature @xmath3 and a  short - range critical wetting \" transition if @xmath2 is very close to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the latter is the case for n - nonane and methanol .",
    "the  substrate \" in these wetting experiments is the saturated vapour phase .",
    "a recent review covers various examples of experimentally observed first - order or continuous wetting transitions in liquid mixtures  @xcite .",
    "the observation of short - range critical wetting in adsorbed binary liquid mixtures is surprising , to say the least .",
    "indeed , due to the presence of van der waals forces , which induce an algebraically decaying long - ranged surface - interface interaction favouring wetting , a first - order wetting transition should be expected  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if the van der waals forces oppose wetting , no wetting transition should occur , unless the leading van der waals interaction amplitude changes sign at some temperature , resulting in  long - range critical wetting \"  @xcite , observed experimentally in pentane on water  @xcite .",
    "however , within the experimentally accessible range of small film thicknesses ( up to @xmath4 ) the van der waals forces can be neglected compared to exponentially decaying mean - field ( mf ) and fluctuation - induced ( fi ) interactions  @xcite .",
    "the range of the mf and fi interactions is determined by the bulk correlation length , which can become as large as the wavelength of visible light very close to the upper consolute point , at @xmath5 , where the two fluid phases become identical .",
    "the experiments , and in particular the measured value of the surface specific - heat exponent , agree with the predictions of the mean - field theory , and disagree strongly with renormalization - group predictions based on a capillary - wave model  @xcite@xmath6  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , monte carlo simulations of short - range critical wetting  @xcite also disagree with the rg predictions but agree with the experiments .",
    "this behaviour can be understood in the light of more sophisticated interface models  @xcite which indicate that the critical region around the transition , in which deviations from mf behaviour show up for the surface specific heat exponent , is too small to be relevant for either experiment or simulation . in other words",
    ", mean - field theory should be an excellent description of simulations and experiments of critical wetting with short - ranged forces .",
    "the experimental observations of mean - field like behaviour are thus entirely in keeping with the latest rg work , since in particular the mass density difference between the wetting phase and the surrounding bulk phase stop the parallel correlation length from getting big enough to see fluctuation effects .",
    "we shall return in detail to the relevance of this mass density difference in what follows .",
    "our aim in this paper is to give a theoretical description of the cross - over between the regimes of first - order wetting and  short - range critical wetting \" in this system , _ which for purely short - range forces would occur via a tricritical wetting point _  @xcite . in view of the observed consistency between experiment and mf theory , and the predictions for the width of the critical region discussed above , we adopt the point of view of the classical theory of cahn - landau type .",
    "we include the van der waals forces as a weak perturbation and also take into account the gravitational thinning of the wetting layer due to the difference in the mass densities of the liquid phases .",
    "we neglect thermal fluctuation effects , but incorporate the influence of the vicinity of bulk criticality at the mf level .",
    "that is , the divergence of the bulk correlation length is included in the theory , but with the mf value for the critical exponent .",
    "in this way , the interplay of wetting and critical adsorption is allowed for .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the microscopic lattice - gas model for the alkane / methanol / vapour system and derive the ising model coupling constants and fields from the intermolecular and chemical potentials . in section iii we extract the continuum cahn - landau theory from the ising model near the bulk critical point . in section",
    "iv we study wetting layer thicknesses , adsorptions , surface free energies , spreading coefficients and critical exponents for the regimes of first - order , tricritical and critical wetting within the model featuring only short range forces .",
    "the cross - over from first - order to critical wetting including long - range forces in the theory is investigated in section v. there we calculate the system parameters corresponding to nonane / methanol , decane / methanol and undecane / methanol and derive adsorptions and spreading coefficients assuming the long - range forces to be a weak perturbation .",
    "we compare our results with the experiments and investigate whether we can interpret them in terms of short - range tricritical wetting or , alternatively , in terms of prewetting criticality induced by long - range forces . in section",
    "vi we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we adopt the philosophy of lattice - gas modeling which is often applied to binary alloys etc . , as exemplified in the lectures of yeomans  @xcite .",
    "we consider a nearest - neighbour spin-1 ising model on a 3-dimensional simple cubic ( sc ) or face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice .",
    "the spin variable takes the value + 1 ( methanol molecule ) , @xmath61 ( alkane molecule ) or 0 ( vacancy ) .",
    "the methanol - rich phase sits at the bottom of the recipient , the alkane - rich phase is in the middle , and the vapour is on top .    given that our entire approach is based at mean - field level it would be appropriate to start from a density - functional theory of a binary mixture with long - ranged fluid - fluid forces , as can be derived starting from this spin-1 model following the works of dietrich and latz  @xcite and getta and dietrich  @xcite .",
    "however , the application of this theory to non - spherical molecules such as alkanes , and to polar molecules such as methanol , would only be a first approximation , so that the difficult calculations inherent in this approach would still not be sufficiently reliable .",
    "we therefore feel the necessity to propose a much simpler strategy to get a handle on the cross - over from first - order to continuous wetting in the presence of long - range forces .",
    "we introduce pair interaction energies @xmath7 for methanol - methanol , @xmath8 for alkane - alkane , and @xmath9 for alkane - methanol pairs at nearest - neighbour distance",
    ". the aa energy corresponds in a first approximation to the lennard - jones potential well depth for the nonpolar alkane molecules and the mm energy can be given either by the lennard - jones or , more appropriately , by the stockmayer potential well depth for the polar methanol molecules  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the chemical potentials @xmath10 and @xmath11 for methanol and alkane particles , respectively .",
    "we make the rough approximation that a _ single lattice constant _ @xmath12 suffices for the model , while in reality the distances of closest approach , reflected e.g. by lennard - jones diameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 can differ for methanol and alkane molecules .",
    "further , we ignore the chain conformation of the n - alkanes and treat them effectively as _",
    "the spin-1 ising model hamiltonian reads @xmath15 where the square brackets @xmath16 indicate that the sums are over nearest neighbours on the lattice .",
    "the ising couplings can easily be determined from the pair energies and chemical potentials , considering the following pairs : vacancy - vacancy , methanol - vacancy , alkane - vacancy , methanol - methanol , alkane - alkane and alkane - methanol .",
    "this leads to the relations @xmath17    since the vapour phase is dilute and the liquid phases are dense , we make the very reasonable approximation that the liquid is free of vacancies and that the liquid - vapour interface is sharp .",
    "this allows us to map the spin-1 model onto a spin-1/2 model _ with a free surface_. the vapour phase",
    "is thus replaced by an inert spectator phase and vacancies no longer play a role .",
    "therefore , inside the adsorbate we have @xmath18 = 1 everywhere , and our model reduces to one with spin 1/2 and bulk hamiltonian @xmath19 for a lattice with coordination number @xmath20 ( @xmath20 = 6 for sc and 12 for fcc ) we can rewrite this and drop the irrelevant constant , so that @xmath21 where the bulk field is given by @xmath22 bulk two - phase coexistence between the alkane - rich and methanol - rich phases is reached for @xmath23 in this model .",
    "we now proceed to derive the surface contribution to the hamiltonian , @xmath24 .",
    "the surface layer of spins is different from layers in the bulk in that there are missing bonds . for the sc lattice",
    "there is 1 nearest neighbour missing per surface site and for fcc there are 4 missing bonds , assuming a ( 100 ) surface for simplicity . for a ( 111 ) surface",
    "there would be 3 missing bonds .",
    "this leads to the result , for the surface layer , @xmath25 where the surface field @xmath26 takes the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 for the sc lattice , and @xmath29 for the fcc lattice . at , or very close to ,",
    "bulk coexistence @xmath30 so that the surface field is governed by @xmath31 . in particular , the surface preferentially adsorbs that species for which the pair binding energy is smallest ( in absolute value ) , in order to minimize the energy increase due to broken bonds .",
    "we can estimate the leading surface field contribution @xmath32 as follows . for n - alkanes",
    "we inspect the liquid - gas critical temperatures @xmath33 and adopt the simple rule @xmath34 for obtaining the lennard - jones potential well depth  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following estimates , from n - pentane ( @xmath35 ) to n - undecane ( @xmath36 ) : @xmath37= 353k ( pentane ) , 380k ( hexane ) , 405k ( heptane ) , 427k ( octane ) , 446k ( nonane ) , 464k ( decane ) , 480k ( undecane ) . for the polar molecule methanol , either we can use the lennard - jones parameter derived using the same rule , which leads to @xmath38 = 385 k , or we can employ the stockmayer potential parameter @xmath39= 417 k  @xcite , which is more suitable for polar molecules . using ( ii.4 ) we see that _ the surface field changes sign _ between hexane and heptane , when the lennard - jones parameter is used for methanol . on the other hand , the sign reversal of @xmath32 occurs _ between heptane and octane _ when the stockmayer parameter is adopted .",
    "experimentally , for short chain length of alkane the alkane - rich phase is preferentially adsorbed at the vapour phase , while for long chain length the methanol - rich phase is preferred  @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the microscopic model , which predicts @xmath40 for short alkanes .",
    "experimentally , the reversal of preferential adsorption takes place ( approximately ) for octane , which agrees well with the theoretical prediction based on the stockmayer potential parameter for methanol , which we will therefore use from now on .",
    "in this section we apply the mean - field approximation to the ising hamiltonian derived in the previous section , and subsequently make the continuum approximation to obtain the cahn - landau theory .",
    "we follow closely the derivation of maritan , langie and indekeu  @xcite , valid for slowly varying concentration profiles and for temperatures close to the consolute point of the alkane / methanol mixture . additionally , we take into account that the mixture is at , or close to , two - phase coexistence in bulk .",
    "let @xmath41 be the number of cells in the lattice - gas representation of our system and @xmath42 the free energy .",
    "we have @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the volume and @xmath12 is the representative molecular diameter , which serves as the lattice constant .",
    "the temperature at the critical point of the binary liquid mixture , or _",
    "upper consolute point _",
    ", is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the reduced free energy density @xmath45 as a function of the order parameter @xmath46 . in our system @xmath46",
    "is the concentration difference of methanol and alkane in the mixture , @xmath47 , minus the critical concentration difference , @xmath48 .",
    "we have , from @xmath49 , @xmath50 with energy density @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the reduced bulk field , @xmath53 .",
    "the entropy density  @xcite , to 4th order in @xmath46 , is given by @xmath54 we obtain @xmath55 note that the model is symmetric with respect to the interchange of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this symmetry is approximately valid for binary liquid mixtures near @xmath3 .    for @xmath58",
    "we obtain the order parameter value @xmath59 for bulk coexistence from @xmath60 .",
    "this leads to @xmath61 , with , for @xmath62 , @xmath63 the free energy near @xmath3 can be rewritten as @xmath64 in general , @xmath59 is found by minimizing @xmath65 , and taking that solution of the cubic equation which has largest modulus .",
    "the other solutions , if real , correspond to metastable and saddle points .",
    "a bulk spinodal results when the latter two coincide .",
    "the cahn - landau surface free - energy functional can be written in the form  @xcite @xmath66 =   \\int",
    "_ 0 ^{\\infty } dz \\left \\",
    "{ \\frac{c^2}{4 } \\left ( \\frac { d\\phi}{dz } \\right ) ^2 + f(\\phi(z ) ) \\right \\ } - h_1 \\phi_1 - g \\frac{\\phi_1 ^ 2}{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 measures the vertical distance from the liquid - vapour interface downwards into the binary liquid mixture .",
    "the distance is in units of the lattice spacing , or representative molecular diameter , in the underlying microscopic model .",
    "the last two terms constitute a surface contact energy which depends on the surface value of the order parameter , @xmath68 , and will be discussed later .",
    "we remark that this functional gives only the surface free energy _ excess _ with respect to a reference value @xmath69 that is independent of @xmath46 , but depends on the temperature and the material parameters of substrate and adsorbate .",
    "therefore , the functional @xmath70 $ ] does not fulfill , for example , the positivity requirement of interfacial tensions in general . since we will need to calculate only _ differences _ of surface free energies of substrate / adsorbate configurations , the unknown @xmath69 drops out .",
    "having defined the function @xmath65 previously , we now proceed to relate the coefficient of the gradient squared , @xmath71 , to microscopic interaction energies and thermodynamic quantities .",
    "this was done in  @xcite , with the result @xmath72 for the 3-dimensional ising model on the sc lattice , @xmath73 , while on the fcc lattice , @xmath74 . for comparison ,",
    "the mean - field value for the critical reduced nearest - neighbour coupling is @xmath75 , where @xmath20 is the coordination number .",
    "this gives @xmath76 for sc , @xmath77 for bcc , and @xmath78 for fcc lattices , in the mean - field theory which we presently employ .",
    "we now address the question whether we can estimate @xmath79 theoretically .",
    "therefore we turn to the microscopic equation ( ii.2 ) relating @xmath79 to the molecular pair potentials .",
    "mixed \" pair energy @xmath9 is still to be determined .",
    "this is a non - trivial task , and we limit ourselves here to proposing reasonable arguments for obtaining a reliable order of magnitude .",
    "this exercise is without quantitative consequences for our theory , since we will not use this estimate further on , but will take experimental surface tension data as input for estimating @xmath79 more reliably .    to proceed",
    "systematically we follow israelachvili  @xcite and compare three classes of molecules : non - polar molecules interacting only through dispersion forces , polar molecules interacting through dispersion and dipolar forces , and polar molecules interacting also through hydrogen - bonding in addition to the other forces .",
    "for example , _ ethane _ ( @xmath80 ) , _ formaldehyde _ ( @xmath81 ) and _ methanol _ ( @xmath82 ) have similar size and weight , but are non - polar , polar , and polar with @xmath83-bonds , respectively .",
    "the stronger is the interaction , the higher is the liquid - gas critical temperature of the pure component .",
    "for example , for ethane @xmath84 , for formaldehyde the dipole - dipole interaction leads to @xmath85 , and additional hydrogen - bonding leads to @xmath86 for methanol .    for unlike molecules within the same interaction class , the lorentz - berthelot combining rule  @xcite",
    ", @xmath87 is often a reasonable approximation .",
    "however , for pairs composed of dissimilar molecules belonging to different classes , this rule can be a very poor approximation leading to ridiculously low estimates of the consolute - point temperature , especially when hydrogen - bonding occurs in one of the two components . the most dramatic manifestation of this  non - additivity \" of interactions is the hydrophobic effect .",
    "when a non - polar component is mixed with water , the disruption of the hydrogen - bonded water network is so costly in energy that , instead of mixing , phase separation is likely to occur . in this case",
    "the mixed interaction strength @xmath88 is smaller than either one of the pure values @xmath8 or @xmath89 , clearly violating ( iii.9 ) .",
    "we infer from this that a qualitatively similar phenomenon should occur when alkanes are mixed with methanol , the latter playing the role of water in the previous example .",
    "the network in this case consists of _ one - dimensional chains",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the mixed alkane - methanol interaction lacks the dipole - dipole and hydrogen - bonding contributions , and to a reasonable approximation one can say that an alkane molecule sees a methanol molecule as if it were a molecule of the same weight and size as methanol , but interacting only through dispersion forces . therefore , for determining the mixed pair interaction , we make the rough approximation to replace methanol effectively by _ ethane _ ,",
    "and then we apply the lorentz - berthelot rule . in doing so",
    ", we also neglect the dipole / induced - dipole contribution ( induction force ) to the mixed - pair van der waals interaction . however , the induction force is usually small compared to the dispersion force  @xcite .    for ethane , we estimate @xmath90 , which gives @xmath91 .",
    "using likewise the lennard - jones parameters for the other n - alkanes and adopting the rule ( iii.9 ) with ethane playing the role of methanol , this amounts to the following mixed pair parameters for alkane - methanol mixtures : @xmath92 ( pentane ) , @xmath93 ( hexane ) , @xmath94 ( heptane ) , @xmath95 ( octane ) , @xmath96 ( nonane ) , @xmath97 ( decane ) , and @xmath98 ( undecane ) .",
    "now the nearest - neighbour couplings @xmath79 can be determined , according to ( ii.2 ) , with the results : @xmath99 ( pentane ) , @xmath100 ( hexane ) , @xmath101 ( heptane ) , @xmath102 ( octane ) , @xmath103 ( nonane ) , @xmath104 ( decane ) and @xmath105 ( undecane ) .",
    "these values can be tested against the reported upper consolute temperatures @xmath3 ( at ambient pressure ) for alkane - methanol mixtures  @xcite , which are @xmath106 ( hexane ) , @xmath107 ( heptane ) , @xmath108 ( octane ) , @xmath109 ( nonane ) , @xmath110 ( decane ) and @xmath111 ( undecane ) .",
    "the ratios @xmath112 are , respectively , 0.169 , 0.164 , 0.162 , 0.159 , 0.157 , and 0.154 .",
    "these are very reasonable , since they lie in between the @xmath113-values for sc and fcc packings , and are very close to the mean - field value for the sc lattice .",
    "we conclude that the simple estimates we have made of the ising model coupling @xmath79 , based on approximate molecular pair energies , are consistent with the correct order of magnitude for the consolute - point temperatures of the binary mixtures and any reasonable choice of cubic lattice ( fcc , bcc or sc ) for the lattice in the model .    a more accurate procedure for determining the parameter @xmath114 , or equivalently @xmath113 , in ( iii.8 ) consists of comparing the experimentally measured liquid - liquid interfacial tension with the theoretical expression , derived within the cahn - landau theory ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , @xmath115 the critical exponent 3/2 is the mean - field value . in real fluids",
    "it is to be replaced by 1.26 , and also the amplitude is to be modified . in order to obtain an estimate for the parameter @xmath114 ,",
    "we inspect published interfacial tension data for the nonane / methanol mixture by carrillo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , for example . at @xmath116",
    "the measured interfacial tension is @xmath117 .",
    "alternatively , we can use the data obtained by kahlweit _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for octane and decane and interpolate linearly between them , which leads to practically the same value @xmath118 .",
    "in order to compare this to the dimensionless quantity @xmath119 of the theory we need to multiply this with the area of a unit cell in the lattice model , since the distance @xmath120 is in these units , and to divide by @xmath121 , with @xmath122 .",
    "the lattice constant @xmath12 is the representative nearest - neighbour distance of a molecular pair . in the lattice model @xmath12 is in principle determined through the number density at the consolute point , through the relation @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the number of methanol ( alkane ) molecules per unit volume .",
    "while this relation is , strictly speaking , reserved for @xmath125 , is actually imposed for all @xmath126 in the lattice approximation , since all the cells are filled either by a @xmath127 or an @xmath128 particle .",
    "the @xmath12 defined in this way lies in between the molecular diameters of the two components , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , as we will illustrate for methanol and nonane in section v. in what follows we adopt a simple approximation and just take the arithmetic mean , @xmath131 .    for methanol @xmath132 ( valid for both lennard - jones and stockmayer potentials ) , while for nonane we may deduce an effective diameter @xmath133 from the excluded volume or",
    " hard - sphere \" volume .",
    "we adopt this useful approximation even if the molecules are of ellipsoidal rather than spherical shape  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the excluded volume and the associated parameter @xmath134 in the van der waals equation of state is @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the critical pressure of the fluid . note that if we use , e.g. , the more complicated peng - robinson equation of state  @xcite , a smaller diameter @xmath137 is obtained .",
    "this value is almost certainly an underestimation , because it leads to a molecular mass density of nonane that is higher than that of methanol , in contradiction with the experimental fact that the methanol - rich phase is heavier than the nonane - rich phase .    for the van der waals equation of state",
    "we conclude @xmath138 , by taking the arithmetic average .",
    "the result for the dimensionless interfacial tension is @xmath139 , using experimental data  @xcite , and @xmath140 , interpolating between experimental data  @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and hence @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "this is an interesting result , close to the values appropriate to the lattices we considered , and very close to the mean - field value 1/6 for the sc lattice .",
    "alternatively , for the peng - robinson equation of state the results are @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively , which is close to the mean - field value for the bcc lattice . while being aware of the quantitative sensitivity of these results to the choice of equation of state , we expect to obtain a qualitatively correct description by using the @xmath12 obtained from the simplest one ( van der waals ) .",
    "we now turn to the identification of the surface field @xmath147 and the surface coupling enhancement @xmath148 in the surface free - energy functional . for the surface field",
    "we have the simple relation  @xcite , @xmath149 where @xmath3 is the consolute - point temperature .",
    "for the enhancement we have , for @xmath62 , @xmath150 with @xmath28 for the sc lattice  @xcite , and @xmath29 for the fcc lattice . we conclude that , since @xmath151 , first - order as well as critical wetting transitions are possible , in principle , as was first demonstrated by nakanishi and fisher  @xcite , who derived the global wetting phase diagrams within cahn - landau theory .",
    "the cahn - landau theory developed so far does not include the effects of the  tails \" of the intermolecular van der waals forces , but only takes into account the short - range part of these forces .",
    "such short - range forces can be constructed artificially , for example , when the tails of the pair potentials are  cut off \" at , e.g. , radial distance @xmath152 as is often done in molecular dynamics simulations of fluids  @xcite .",
    "our first concern is to check , within the short - range forces frame - work , the order of the wetting transition predicted for the n - alkane / methanol mixtures . to this end",
    "we make use of the results derived in  @xcite .",
    "however , the notation of that paper can not be applied directly , because the definitions of the bulk free energy densities @xmath153 differ by a factor 12 between that work and the present one ( which uses the definitions of  @xcite ) .",
    "if we take this into account we find that _ tricritical wetting",
    "_ occurs for @xmath154 critical wetting takes place for @xmath155 and first - order wetting results for @xmath156 ( which includes also @xmath157 ) .    for wetting or drying transitions close to @xmath3 we can use the previously mentioned expression ( iii.14 ) for @xmath148 .",
    "if the transition is not very close to @xmath3 we can use the more general result  @xcite , which includes a correction of first order in @xmath158 , and replace @xmath148 by @xmath159 .",
    "likewise , for @xmath160 we can use ( iii.5 ) or the more generally valid value which results from solving the equation @xmath161 using as input the experimentally determined transition temperatures , we give the results for @xmath162 , for both methods and for the two lattices concerned , in table i.    experimentally , the hexane / methanol mixture shows a wetting phase transition , with hexane as the wetting component , at @xmath163 . since in this case",
    "the alkane - rich phase wets the liquid - vapour interface , methanol droplets detach from this interface .",
    "this can be called a  drying \" transition , if we agree always to refer to methanol as the  wetting \" component .",
    "this leads to @xmath164 assuming sc packing and @xmath155 for fcc , so that the theory , based on short - range forces alone , would locate this transition not far from the tricritical point , but probably still in the critical drying regime . for the heptane / methanol mixture the drying transition takes place at @xmath165 , leading to estimates for @xmath162 well inside the critical drying range . for octane / methanol",
    "no transition was detected .",
    "possibly it occurs very close to @xmath3 .",
    "for these three systems no detailed measurements were made to study the order of the drying transition .    a clear first - order wetting transition , on the other hand ,",
    "was observed for undecane / methanol , with methanol as wetting phase , at @xmath166 .",
    "the resulting @xmath162-values satisfy @xmath156 ( sc ) and @xmath155 ( fcc ) , which indicate that this transition is not far from the tricritical wetting point @xmath167 if we neglect the tails of the van der waals forces . for decane / methanol @xmath168",
    ", so that all @xmath162-estimates are already within the critical wetting range .",
    "this is more pronounced still for the nonane / methanol mixture , with @xmath169 . for this last mixture short - range critical wetting",
    "is observed experimentally .",
    "this suggests that the effect of the van der waals forces on this transition is quite weak .",
    "the scrutiny of this is the subject of the next section .    on the basis of the results in table",
    "i we can locate approximately the tricritical wetting point , corresponding to the choice of the sc lattice .",
    "for both approximations ( first and second column of table i ) we obtain that the tricritical condition @xmath170 falls between decane and undecane .",
    "decane / methanol is predicted to show critical wetting and undecane / methanol to display first - order wetting .",
    "more precisely for the first approximation , valid close to @xmath3 , we obtain @xmath171 for tricriticality . using linear interpolation",
    "this leads to an effective chain length of 10.72 , which can in principle be achieved by using mixtures  @xcite . for the second approximation",
    "the tricritical point is at @xmath172 and chain length 10.27 .",
    "both of these estimates from this theory with only short - range forces are in qualitative agreement with our recent experiments which indicate a crossover from first - order to critical wetting with a tricritical wetting point between an effective alkane carbon number of 9.6 and 10  @xcite .",
    "since the results for both approximations do not differ significantly , in contrast to the results for different choices of lattices , we will henceforth adopt the simple first approximation valid close to @xmath3 , unless stated otherwise .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we illustrate typical results based on the short - range - forces theory , and compute the layer thickness , the adsorption , and the pertinent surface free energies versus temperature , at fixed bulk field very close to two - phase coexistence .",
    "we recall that bulk coexistence corresponds to the condition @xmath58 . in view of ( ii.3 - 4 ) and ( ii.9 )",
    "this reads @xmath173 . since our system is in a gravitational field and the chemical potential of a particle ( as defined in the absence of the field ) depends on its height through a gravitational potential energy contribution , this equality is only satisfied at one particular height , which is , of course , the position of the _ liquid - liquid _ interface . at a small elevation @xmath174 above this interface , where the liquid - vapour interface is situated , there is a non - zero bulk field @xmath175 , favouring alkane molecules .",
    "since we have put all particles on a lattice with a single lattice constant , the magnitude of @xmath52 depends not only on the difference in molecular weight of m and a molecules , but also on the specific volume per molecule in the real liquid mixture . in section",
    "v we estimate @xmath52 , give an explicit expression for it , and show that it is essentially independent of temperature .",
    "we can therefore perform all calculations at fixed @xmath175 for all relevant @xmath126 , below , at , and above @xmath3 .",
    "we will focus on 3 cases : first - order wetting @xmath176 , for example ) , tricritical wetting @xmath177 and critical wetting @xmath178 , for example ) . before embarking on these cases , we discuss some generalities concerning the order parameter and the free energy .",
    "* a. the wetting layer thickness * + when a sufficient amount of methanol is adsorbed at the alkane / vapour interface , it is convenient to define a layer thickness @xmath179 , which corresponds to the region occupied by a methanol - rich film . in our model @xmath179",
    "is measured from @xmath180 up to the position @xmath181 where the concentration almost equals that of the alkane - rich phase , which is the bulk concentration .",
    "there is some freedom in defining where precisely this bulk phase starts , and the results are not sensitive to this definition , as long as it remains reasonable .",
    "we choose to define @xmath179 implicitly so that @xmath182 , which is useful even for small adsorbed amounts .",
    "for thick wetting films on the other hand , the simpler definition @xmath183 would work equally well .",
    "both types of choices were examined previously when studying alkanes on water  @xcite . incidentally ,",
    "note that the choice @xmath184 is not possible , since it would result in @xmath185 in view of the exponential decay of the concentration to its bulk value .",
    "* b. the adsorption or coverage * + the arbitrariness in the definition of the layer thickness is avoided when working with the alternative order parameter , the adsorption or coverage .",
    "this is a measure of the total adsorbed amount per unit area , obtained by integrating the concentration excess .",
    "the adsorption @xmath186 is thus defined as @xmath187 there is a close connection between the adsorption and the experimentally measured quantity . in the particular case of binary liquid mixtures that we study , the experiment makes use of ellipsometry , and the measured ellipticity is proportional to the adsorption at the liquid - vapour interface  @xcite , provided the wetting layer thickness does not exceed @xmath188 .",
    "this condition is well satisfied in all our experiments . working with the adsorption",
    "is all the more useful since in the thin - film regime experiments have been performed with only a small amount of excess material adsorbed at the interface and in this case a layer thickness is hard to define .    * c. the surface free energies * + if the measurements were performed precisely at two - phase coexistence of the methanol - rich and alkane - rich phases , one could work with the three interfacial tensions @xmath189 ,",
    "@xmath190 and @xmath119 , which are defined as follows . the interfacial tension between methanol and alkane has already been defined in ( iii.10 ) , and is an absolute quantity , since no unknown constant intervenes .",
    "the interfacial tension @xmath189 between the vapour and the alkane - rich phase can be calculated by minimizing ( iii.7 ) with the bulk condition @xmath191 , and likewise @xmath190 is obtained using the bulk condition associated with the methanol - rich phase , @xmath192 .",
    "the latter two surface free energies are relative quantities , which can be seen most easily from the fact that it follows from the theory that they are zero at the bulk consolute point , for a spatially constant order parameter @xmath193 .",
    "the true interfacial tension for that hypothetical profile is a constant , @xmath69 , the value of which we do not need to know .",
    "we now define the _ equilibrium spreading coefficient _",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath194 partial wetting corresponds to @xmath195 . in this case",
    "young s law allows us to obtain the contact angle @xmath196 which a methanol - rich droplet makes against the alkane / vapour interface , @xmath197 complete wetting corresponds to an equilibrium spreading coefficient equal to zero , but if we denote by @xmath198 the free energy of a _ stable or metastable _ surface state with a thin adsorbed film of the methanol - rich phase , then we can define within mean - field theory a more general _ spreading coefficient _ @xmath199 through @xmath200 with this definition , @xmath201 for the complete wetting regime between the wetting transition and the upper spinodal point .",
    "@xmath199 ceases to be defined for temperatures above this spinodal , as @xmath198 is no longer defined .",
    "a first - order wetting transition is then characterized by a simple zero - crossing of @xmath199 .",
    "critical wetting is more subtle , because in this case there is no metastable extension of the thin film .",
    "@xmath0 approaches zero from below , with vanishing slope , without crossing zero . in this case ,",
    "a generalization @xmath199 different from @xmath0 does not exist .",
    "due to gravitational effects the methanol - rich phase is slightly off of coexistence , while the alkane - rich phase is stable in bulk , at the elevation at which the alkane / vapour interface and the methanol wetting layer reside .",
    "typically , this elevation is 5 mm above the methanol / alkane interface . in practice , while we can calculate under these circumstances the quantity @xmath189 , we must have recourse to approximations for computing the other two surface free energies .",
    "we will address this interesting problem for the cases of first - order and critical wetting separately .",
    "first - order wetting * + when the wetting transition is of first order , we can , for our present purpose of illustrating the method , restrict our attention to zero surface coupling enhancement , @xmath202 .",
    "then the surface field @xmath147 which induces the transition is given by the relation  @xcite @xmath203 where @xmath204 denotes the value of @xmath160 and therefore the temperature at which the wetting transition takes place .",
    "we take @xmath205 so that @xmath206 .",
    "the factor @xmath207 is present because our units are different from those of  @xcite .",
    "of special interest for us is also the upper spinodal , corresponding to the metastability limit of the thin film upon increasing the temperature towards @xmath3 .",
    "this point is located at @xmath208 where @xmath147 is the surface field defined in ( iv.7 ) and @xmath209 determines the spinodal temperature . in the experiments the wetting layers occur at a height where the wetting phase is slightly undersaturated , corresponding to @xmath210 ( see section v ) . here",
    "we take a somewhat larger undersaturation , @xmath211 , for greater clarity of presentation .",
    "we will encounter the prewetting transition and the upper prewetting spinodal at slightly higher temperatures than the wetting transition and associated spinodal at bulk coexistence . as was mentioned already , the undersaturation ( in methanol ) is a consequence of the gravitational contribution to the chemical potential .",
    "the main effect of this is that the wetting layer can not reach macroscopic thickness . for a more detailed study of first - order wetting transitions under gravity",
    ", we refer to reference  @xcite . on the other hand the lower prewetting spinodal , which is the metastability limit of the thick film upon decreasing the temperature , typically lies at a temperature far below that of the equilibrium phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the phase portrait follows from the first integral or  constant of the motion \" derived from the euler - lagrange equation  @xcite @xmath212 this conservation law reads , with @xmath213 , @xmath214 while we will work with the sc microscopic lattice model in the applications to the experiments ( section v ) , in this methodological section we work , for a change , with the fcc lattice .",
    "we therefore have @xmath215 in mf theory , implying @xmath216 . with this choice",
    "the value of @xmath147 is fixed by ( iv.7 ) and equals 0.00321 .",
    "the bulk condition reads @xmath217 which corresponds to the alkane - rich phase .",
    "the boundary condition at the liquid - vapour interface  @xcite reads @xmath218    figure 1 shows the thickness @xmath179 of the thin film and the thick film as a function of temperature , for fixed @xmath147 and @xmath202 .",
    "the calculations have been performed for temperatures below as well as above the consolute temperature @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath219 there is no wetting layer , since the bulk phases are fully mixed into a single phase .",
    "however , the preferential adsorption of methanol at the liquid / vapour interface remains visible as a methanol - enriched transition zone , which close to @xmath3 is called _",
    "critical adsorption_.    we distinguish the thin film and the wetting layer , which , strictly speaking , is a prewetting layer .",
    "the wetting transition ( more precisely , prewetting transition ) , where the film and the layer exchange stability , is indicated by the vertical dashed line .",
    "the thin film is stable at low temperature , becomes metastable above the wetting point and remains metastable up till the spinodal temperature ( open circle ) .",
    "the wetting layer is metastable below the wetting point and stable above it .",
    "when the temperature crosses @xmath3 the wetting layer state gradually changes to a state in which a methanol - rich layer sits on a single ( fully mixed ) bulk phase .",
    "close to the critical point there is a marked increase in the layer thickness , below as well as above @xmath3 .",
    "this is related to the well - documented phenomenon of critical adsorption  @xcite , which entails a slow ( algebraic ) decay of the concentration profile into the bulk phase in place of the usual exponential decay , in this theory , governed by the length scale set by the bulk correlation length @xmath220 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath220 at @xmath3 leads to a diverging layer thickness , as we have defined it .",
    "since this effect is sensitive to the definition of the layer thickness , it is preferable to study the adsorption @xmath186 , to which we now turn .",
    "figure 2 shows how the adsorption @xmath186 varies with temperature , for the case of first - order wetting .",
    "the vertical line denotes the wetting transition as in fig.1 .",
    "in contrast with the layer thickness , the adsorption gives a unique and reliable estimate of the concentration excess near the liquid / vapour interface . in the thin - film state",
    "the adsorption follows closely the layer thickness variation .",
    "however , in the wetting layer the adsorption behaves qualitatively differently from @xmath179 .",
    "well below @xmath3 the adsorption depends on the undersaturation , described by the bulk field @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath52 is decreased to zero , the wetting layer becomes macroscopically thick and the adsorption diverges . in mean - field theory",
    "this divergence is logarithmic in @xmath221 , as our computations confirm . on the other hand , close to and at @xmath3",
    "the adsorption varies rapidly as a function of temperature ( at fixed undersaturation ) , as fig.2 shows .",
    "the value of @xmath186 at @xmath3 , as a function of @xmath52 , is described by the scaling laws of critical adsorption  @xcite . in mean - field theory",
    "there is ( again ) a logarithmic divergence in @xmath221 , while for real fluids the divergence is of the power - law form @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the bulk order - parameter and correlation - length exponents , respectively , and @xmath225 is the bulk gap exponent which appears when temperature - like exponents are converted to field - like ones . in mean - field theory @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the combined result of the increased adsorption at @xmath3 and the presence of the wetting layer below @xmath3 is what is seen in fig.2 .",
    "we would like to stress that the monotonic behaviour of @xmath228 displayed here is not the only possible one . depending on the undersaturation , which opposes wetting , and the precise magnitude of the surface field favouring wetting , non - monotonic",
    "adsorption and critical depletion phenomena can also occur  @xcite , when the temperature approaches @xmath3 from above .",
    "turning now to the surface free energy , figure 3 shows this quantity for the thin film and for the wetting layer .",
    "the first - order character of the wetting transition is clearly seen from the crossing of the free energy branches , and the upper spinodal is also indicated . due to the slight undersaturation",
    "a spreading coefficient can not be defined rigorously , but for small @xmath229 a very good approximation to @xmath199 defined in ( iv.6 ) is given by @xmath230 clearly , @xmath231 for the thin film , and @xmath201 for the wetting layer . in reality , @xmath199 is slightly larger than this approximation by an amount of the order of @xmath232 , where @xmath179 is the layer thickness . for small @xmath52 , as for our calculations , this correction is unimportant .",
    "tricritical wetting * + the tricritical wetting transition takes place for the following special values of the surface coupling enhancement @xmath148 and surface field @xmath147  @xcite , @xmath233 @xmath234 again we fix the wetting transition at @xmath205 so that @xmath206 and we use the same lattice parameters ( fcc ) as in the previous case . the computation of the layer thickness @xmath179 is straightforward and for a bulk field @xmath235 , in the experimentally relevant range , the result is shown in figure 4 ( curve  tcw \" ) .",
    "the most remarkable feature of this figure is the weakness of the layer thickness increase in the vicinity of the wetting transition , at @xmath236 . in order to see a stronger increase of @xmath179 , the bulk field",
    "must be made smaller in magnitude than the @xmath237 we have chosen .",
    "however , a smaller value of @xmath229 will also lead to a larger value of @xmath179 at @xmath3 , associated with the diverging bulk correlation length at bulk criticality . with our choice of @xmath52",
    "we have attempted to visualize the two effects using the same scale of @xmath179 .",
    "the value of @xmath179 at @xmath3 is @xmath238 .    for comparison with experimentally measured quantities ,",
    "it is more appropriate to study the adsorption @xmath186 .",
    "the result of the calculation for the same field @xmath235 is shown in figure 5 ( curve  tcw \" ) .",
    "now the tricritical wetting transition at @xmath239 is clearly detectable as well as the critical adsorption phenomenon for @xmath240 approaching 1 .",
    "this is how , in the theory dealing with short - range forces alone , both phenomena manifest themselves when the adsorbate is slightly off of two - phase coexistence in bulk ( by fixing @xmath52 ) . comparing this with the adsorption calculated for a first - order wetting transition ( and somewhat larger bulk field magnitude ) , shown in fig.2",
    ", we can easily distinguish the continuous and reversible adsorption at tricritical wetting from the discontinuous and hysteretic behaviour of @xmath186 at first - order wetting .    in the experiments it is possible to measure contact angles , and therefore the spreading coefficient , in spite of the slight undersaturation of the wetting phase at the liquid - vapour interface .",
    "it would thus be very welcome to be able to calculate @xmath196 or @xmath0 for states slightly off of two - phase coexistence , although these quantities are , strictly speaking , not well defined under these circumstances . for the case of a first - order wetting transition we could circumvent this problem by taking advantage of the existence of two states , the thin film and the wetting layer , so that @xmath0 could be approximated as in ( iv.14 ) . in the vicinity of continuous wetting transitions , however , there is only one film state , and we must have recourse to a new , more general method . in the following",
    "we develop an approximation , which allows us to calculate @xmath0 for situations in which the wetting phase is metastable , but sufficiently long - lived .    for states off of coexistence , only one of the three surface tensions that feature in the spreading coefficient",
    "is well defined . in our system",
    "this is @xmath189 , since the alkane - rich phase is stable in bulk at the height of the liquid - vapour interface , while the methanol - rich phase is metastable .",
    "we denote this metastable phase by @xmath241 . in figure 6",
    "we have sketched the configuration of a metastable droplet of methanol attached to the alkane - vapour interface , for which we would like to calculate @xmath0 and hence obtain the contact angle from the young equation .",
    "we begin by formally defining the following approximation to @xmath0 , @xmath242 our task is now to give meaning to and to calculate the last two terms .    in spite of its thermodynamic metastability",
    "the attached droplet is in mechanical equilibrium , and it takes a long time ( typically weeks ) before the droplet disappears , through diffusion , and its content eventually joins the methanol - rich phase at the bottom . clearly , all three interfacial tensions are measurable and should therefore be calculable , in principle .",
    "their calculation is most easily explained by examining the phase portrait  @xcite shown in figure 7 .",
    "the solid lines with arrows give the trajectories , which start at points that obey the boundary condition @xmath243 and which end at the bulk fixed point , at @xmath59 , or at the metastable bulk fixed point at @xmath244 .",
    "the trajectory from @xmath245 to @xmath59 is the one that minimizes @xmath189 .",
    "we propose to define @xmath246 as the excess surface free energy relative to the metastable bulk phase @xmath241 .",
    "this excess quantity is defined using the modified functional @xmath247 = \\int _ 0 ^{\\infty } dz \\left \\",

    ", @xmath249 minimization of this functional gives the trajectory which runs from @xmath250 to @xmath244 .",
    "finally , we define the interfacial tension between the metastable and stable bulk phases @xmath241 and @xmath128 as follows .",
    "since the alkane - rich phase is stable in bulk , it is obvious that we must define @xmath251 as the excess free energy relative to the stable phase , and therefore use @xmath65 defined in ( iii.6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the trajectory must start at @xmath244 and end at @xmath59 .",
    "the optimal concentration profile , which minimizes the surface free energy , does not start with zero derivative , but with a finite value of @xmath252 ( see dotted line in fig.7 ) .",
    "this small jump in derivative is caused by the slight undersaturation of the metastable phase , and vanishes for @xmath253 . in that limit @xmath251",
    "approaches @xmath119 given by ( iii.10 ) .    the approximation scheme",
    "we adopt neglects the excess free energy in bulk of @xmath241 relative to @xmath128 in calculating @xmath246 , since we use @xmath254 in place of @xmath153 .",
    "this contribution is to be multiplied with the thickness , along @xmath120 , of the region occupied by the @xmath241 phase , in order to obtain the excess surface free energy .",
    "hence , our approach , which is an approximation assuming small undersaturation , should be more accurate for small droplets than for large ones .",
    "note that for small undersaturation droplets of a wide range of sizes can be observed as being metastable .",
    "the result of the approximation is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the two surface free energy curves approach one another almost tangentially , at @xmath236 . at this point",
    "the curves actually cross .",
    "however , this can not be seen on the scale of the figure .",
    "the curves appear coincident for @xmath255 .",
    "for example , at @xmath256 the difference in reduced surface free energy is only about @xmath257 .",
    "the crossing of the curves is due to the fact that the system is slightly off of coexistence . in the limit",
    "@xmath258 the curves meet tangentially at the tricritical wetting point , and the curve associated with @xmath189 stops there .",
    "this is in contrast with fig.3 , where the thin - film state continues to exist as a metastable state up till the spinodal point .",
    "in fact , tricriticality is achieved when the spinodal coincides with the wetting transition itself .",
    "the difference of the two curves of fig.8 gives the spreading coefficient , which will be discussed together with that for critical wetting .",
    "* case 3 : critical wetting * + the critical wetting transition takes place under the following restrictions of the surface coupling enhancement @xmath148 and surface field @xmath147  @xcite , @xmath259 @xmath234 in this range we choose @xmath260 , and the wetting temperature , bulk field and lattice parameter are chosen the same as for the previous case of tricritical wetting .",
    "the result for the layer thickness @xmath179 is shown in fig.4 ( curve  cw \" ) .",
    "as in the previous case , the increase of @xmath179 in the vicinity of the critical wetting transition at @xmath261 is quite weak compared with the critical adsorption peak at @xmath3 .",
    "the value of @xmath179 at @xmath3 equals @xmath262 .",
    "further , the critical wetting transition presents a weaker signal than the tricritical wetting transition .",
    "the comparison between tricritical and critical wetting can be made most clearly in fig.5 , which shows the adsorption .",
    "the behaviour at critical wetting is continuous , while the tricritical transition is almost discontinuous , which is to be expected in view of the fact that tricriticality marks the onset of the regime of first - order ( discontinuous ) transitions .",
    "the calculation of the surface free energy proceeds along the approximation scheme outlined in the previous section , and the result is shown in figure 9 .",
    "as in the case of tricritical wetting , the two curves approach each other almost tangentially at the wetting point .",
    "the difference of the two curves determines the spreading coefficient @xmath0 , which is shown in figure 10 for the three cases : critical wetting ( cw ) , tricritical wetting ( tcw ) , and first - order wetting ( fow ) . for this comparison , the same bulk field , @xmath235 ,",
    "was imposed . as expected",

    "besides this fortuitous point , the merit of this simple  molecular mass \"- type of approximation is that it clearly shows that @xmath52 is independent of temperature , to the extent that the height difference @xmath174 between the interfaces is constant .    in order to correct qualitatively for the error made by using a single effective diameter for the two molecules in the lattice gas model , we can work with molecular mass densities instead of molecular masses as follows . instead of @xmath314 and @xmath315",

    "moreover , the experimentally observed adsorption curve , through ellipticity measurements , is shown in fig.12 and is similar to this theoretical one .",
    "the solution to this paradox lies entirely in the fact that the system is not at bulk two - phase coexistence . at coexistence",
    "the wetting transition is definitely of first order , by virtue of the interface potential barrier between the macroscopic (  infinitely \" thick ) wetting layer and the thin film .",
    "however , off of coexistence the system does not display first - order wetting but features a prewetting line , which is very short in temperature as well as in bulk field , for very weak long - range forces .",

    "there is hardly a way to distinguish the tricritical adsorption jump from a genuine weak first - order jump of the order parameter .",
    "the hysteresis is so minute that the lower and upper spinodal points @xmath371 and @xmath372 practically coincide in temperature .",
    "the physics contained in fig.13 can be understood in detail by unraveling the wetting phase diagram associated with these srf and lrf parameters for decane / methanol .",
    "this is done in fig.14 , which shows a clear first - order wetting transition at bulk coexistence , with a first - order prewetting line emerging from it .",
    "the lower and upper spinodal lines merge with this prewetting line at the _ prewetting critical point_. for bulk fields larger in magnitude than the value associated with this point , the transition is  supercritical \" and has the appearance of critical wetting as is the case in fig.11 ( nonane / methanol ) . for smaller fields in magnitude",
    "the transition is first - order . in the immediate vicinity of the prewetting critical point , relevant",
    "to decane / methanol in our approximation of weak lrf forces , the transition appears tricritical .",

    "indeed , our best fit of the numerical data close to @xmath2 leads to the estimate @xmath376 and @xmath377 .",
    "this clearly shows that the van der waals tails of the net forces between interfaces govern the divergence of the wetting layer thickness and the surface free - energy singularity close to @xmath2 and for @xmath253 . for prewetting in systems with short - range forces we would have @xmath378 and in addition a logarithmic correction factor would be present .",
    "the experimental adsorption data for decane / methanol are shown in fig.15 .",
    "the data show a rapid continuous rise , but accompanied by some hysteresis , suggesting that the transition possesses features of both continuous and first - order character",
    ". the obvious presence of metastability ( in the experimental data ) provides fairly strong evidence for an essentially first - order wetting transition .    for the critical exponent @xmath341 our fit to the theoretical curve of fig.13 for temperatures below and close to @xmath2 gives @xmath379 which compares favourably with the tricritical value @xmath380 and less well with the critical value @xmath381 associated with prewetting criticality ( which is just a mf critical point in our model ) .",
    "the experimental estimate for this system is @xmath382 .",
    "we conclude that although the transition is , strictly speaking , a first - order transition the exponent @xmath341 is not far from its tricritical value .",
    "this is also the case for the experimental system . + * c. undecane / methanol * + for this system the bulk field determination proceeds like in the previous ones , taking into account the molecular weight for undecane @xmath383 amu and the consolute point for undecane / methanol , @xmath384 .",

    "this is larger than the experimentally determined transition temperature @xmath407 , which is consistent with the anticipation that agonistic lrf will lower the wetting temperature .",
    "however , since we take the lrf into account only perturbatively , we can not expect that @xmath2 will be lowered sufficiently to obtain good agreement with experiment . from ( iv.1 )",
    "we obtain @xmath408 , which is still well within the critical wetting regime but closer to triciticality than the two previous mixtures .",
    "note that this self - consistent determination of @xmath162 differs significantly from the @xmath162 presented in table i for n - undecane / methanol ( sc lattice ) , derived using the experimental wetting temperature as input . indeed , while the latter indicates that the short - range wetting transition is already of first order ( @xmath156 ) , the current self - consistent calculation requires the intervention of the long - range forces to drive the wetting transition first - order .",
    "weak long - range forces , for which for simplicity we assume the same strength @xmath338 as for both previous mixtures , already drive the transition clearly first - order , as is shown through the adsorption displayed in fig.16 .",
    "the wetting temperature is only slightly lowered to @xmath409 , due to the fact that our approach treats the lrf as a small perturbation only .",
    "the adsorption curve of fig.16 differs somewhat from the typical first - order adsorption signal ( fig.2 ) in that the hysteresis is much smaller .",
    "this is due to the vicinity of the system to the prewetting critical point .",
    "interestingly , the experimental data for this mixture displayed in fig.17 show a clear first - order jump but without hysteresis , unlike for decane / methanol .",
    "the fact that the hysteresis is unobservably small is in line with recent experiments on other binary liquid mixtures , such as cyclohexane/@xmath410 with gravity - thinned wetting layers not thicker than about @xmath411  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in almost density - matched systems , like cyclohexane / methanol , with gravity - thinned wetting layers of about @xmath412 , much larger hysteresis is observed .",
    "this has now been understood by calculating the activation energy for wetting layer nucleation as a function of the film thickness  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the surprising feature is not the absence of hysteresis for undecane / methanol , but the presence of it for decane / methanol !    finally , obviously for this fairly strong first - order wetting transition the critical exponent analysis immediately leads to @xmath413 , as expected , since the mean - field free - energy branches cross leading to a corner in the equilibrium free energy ( discontinuous derivative ) .",
    "in this paper we have been concerned with addressing theoretically a variety of recently observed wetting phenomena displaying the richness of the wetting phase diagram proposed by nakanishi and fisher  @xcite , featuring first - order , critical and tricritical wetting . in addition , we have studied how , for the experimental systems under consideration , the wetting phase transitions are modified by taking into account approximately the effect of long - range forces .",
    "many authors , in particular de gennes , and ebner and saam , predicted that for long - range forces favouring wetting , critical wetting transitions should become first - order  @xcite .",
    "this is not what is observed in the experiments .",
    "mixtures of alkanes and methanol , with the methanol - rich phase wetting the liquid - vapour interface , have been observed to pass from continuous wetting to first - order wetting as the alkane chain length is increased from 9 till 11 .",
    "the experiments are consistent with a tricritical wetting transition occurring at some intermediate effective chain length between 9.6 and 10  @xcite .    the theoretical description which we have explored here supplements previous works on similar systems in two respects : we have taken into account that the systems are _ slightly away from the conditions of bulk two - phase coexistence _ , and , more importantly , we have allowed for _ effects of long - range forces between interfaces _ , arising from the inverse power - law van der waals forces between the molecules .",
    "it has been necessary to make these extensions of the theory , simply because several paradoxes concerning the interpretation of the experiments were up to now left unresolved .",
    "for example , the main apparent contradiction embodied in the observation of short - range critical wetting  @xcite is that _ van der waals forces favouring wetting should drive the transition first - order_. why was this not seen in the experiments ?",
    "the answer that we provide here , and which is complementary to the points of view defended in  @xcite , is that weak long - range forces _ combined with _ a small  bulk field \" which takes the phases just slightly off of coexistence , do not alter the appearance of short - range critical wetting .",
    "we have thus obtained evidence that on the one hand critical wetting can persist , to any reasonable degree of computational accuracy or practical observability , in slightly undersaturated systems with weak long - range forces favouring wetting , while on the other hand first - order wetting is - of course - the generic phenomenon .",
    "consequently , it is fundamentally interesting to scrutinize the cross - over between the two .",
    "the experiments have shown  @xcite that this cross - over is consistent with a short - range tricritical wetting transition scenario . here",
    "we find that this interpretation is a good approximation , adequate for all practical purposes , even in systems which instead of displaying strict tricriticality , show a very short prewetting line emerging from a first - order wetting transition at bulk coexistence .",
    "the role of the tricritical point in the short - range forces limit is taken over by that of the prewetting critical point in the presence of agonistic long - range forces , no matter how weak .",
    "the two are difficult to distinguish in practice , both as regards the order parameter singularity and concerning the critical exponent associated with the surface free energy singularity .",
    "this exponent , @xmath341 , takes the value @xmath380 for tricritical wetting and the value @xmath381 for prewetting criticality .    in sum",
    ", systems slightly off of coexistence can behave qualitatively differently from those at coexistence .",
    "the most spectacular example we have found in this regard is the possibility of a continuous - looking wetting transition under circumstances in which the wetting transition at coexistence is always of first order .",
    "this is the case when the long - range forces are agonistic , and consequently short - range first - order wetting remains first - order , and short - range critical wetting must turn into a first - order transition , in principle .",
    "the methods we have employed and the theory we have developed are to a large extent qualitative , at times heuristic , and eventually amount to a simple mean - field description of the interacting many - body system .",
    "why should the mean - field theory be a good approximation in this case ?",
    "there are several justifications , the most decisive of which is that the width of the critical region in which deviations from mean - field critical behaviour should occur is far too small to be observable experimentally or in monte carlo simulations for equivalent ising - like systems with short - range forces .",
    "this is a prediction from the latest sophisticated functional renormalization group theory .",
    "the second reason is that , as soon as van der waals forces are added to the theory , the upper critical dimension above which mean - field critical exponents are valid , is lowered from @xmath414 ( short - range forces ) to @xmath415 .",
    "the third reason is the clarity of the investigation .",
    "we have included the effect of a small bulk field , and of a weak substrate - adsorbate field with algebraic decay , as complications on top of an otherwise already rich cahn - landau theory .",
    "it would not be instructive to add yet a third complication , in the form of forces arising from interface capillary wave fluctuations , before a full understanding of the other two refinements has been achieved .",
    "moreover , due to the undersaturation of the wetting phase ( gravitational thinning of the wetting layer ) the parallel and transverse correlation lengths of the relevant unbinding interface can not get large enough for long - wavelength capillary waves to develop .",
    "so the presence of the bulk field renders capillary - wave considerations superfluous , at least in this system .    while adhering fully to a mean - field theory , we have also indicated how one can arrive at the surface free - energy functional starting from a microscopic lattice model of ising spin-1 type .",
    "further , we have aimed at providing reasonable estimates for all the phenomenological parameters in the theory , starting from microscopic system constants such as molecular interaction potentials ( pair energies and particle diameters ) and molecular weights . in this way the bulk field , surface field and surface enhancements appropriate to the different mixtures have been related to more fundamental variables .",
    "it has not been possible to complete this scheme fully self - consistently , and it has been necessary to use as input experimentally measured interfacial tensions , for example , for obtaining the appropriate lattice coordination number in the microscopic model , leading to the use of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "the important parameter for which we have been unable to provide a reliable system - specific estimate is the amplitude @xmath275 of the long - range forces .",
    "the reason for this is that the theory requires the knowledge of the entire function @xmath271 while only the leading term , related to the hamaker constant , is known with reasonable accuracy for a given system . to resolve this draw - back ,",
    "we have opted for a perturbative theory , in which the effect of weak long - range forces is examined on the wetting transitions dictated by the theory incorporating short - range forces .",
    "we have thus fixed @xmath275 to a value , one order of magnitude smaller than an estimate based on the hamaker constant .",
    "this is in line with the experimental fact that the physics predicted by the theory involving short - range forces is in good accord with the observed continuous wetting phenomenon in nonane / methanol  @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable of our findings is that the long - range forces _ are _ perturbative .",
    "indeed , the inclusion of weak long - range forces does _ not _ turn the observable critical wetting transition into a first - order one .",
    "this seemingly contradicts previous theoretical works which indicated that critical wetting must be ruled out for agonistic lrf .",
    "as we emphasized , this is due to the presence of a small bulk field , turning macroscopic wetting layers into mesoscopic ones ( only hundreds of @xmath272 thick ) .    as new technical theoretical advances we have achieved the computation of generalizations of spreading coefficients for systems slightly displaced from two - phase coexistence in bulk",
    "this is useful for continuous wetting transitions , in the vicinity of which only one surface state is thermodynamically stable .",
    "further , we have found that the adsorption is on many accounts a useful and well - defined order parameter , which is easy to interpret , in contrast with the wetting layer thickness . using the adsorption",
    "the phenomena of ( pre-)wetting and critical adsorption can be viewed on equal footing ( see figs .",
    "2,5,11,13,16 ) and comparison with the experimentally measured ellipticity is directly possible .",
    "all in all , we believe that the present work elucidates the systems in as far as mean - field theory can describe them .",
    "the additions of deviations from bulk coexistence and the perturbative effect of long - range forces appear crucial to a better modeling and understanding of the experiments .",
