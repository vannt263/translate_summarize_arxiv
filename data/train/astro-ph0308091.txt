    "the total x - ray emission from a spiral galaxy consists of the sum of the emission from its x - ray - emitting constituents including x - ray binaries ( low - mass and high - mass ) , supernova remnants , ob star clusters , other point sources , and the hot component of the interstellar medium .",
    "this last component is expected to be present based upon the theoretical work of @xcite and @xcite among many others .",
    "prior to the launch of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , the hot component had been detected in a handful of galaxies , largely as a consequence of the broad spatial resolution of previous x - ray telescopes which distributed x - rays from point sources over a wide region of the galaxy , contaminating any signal from the hot ism .",
    "the study of the x - ray emission from normal galaxies commenced with the _ einstein _ observations of galaxies ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of _ einstein _ , @xmath41@xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , prevented separation of the x - ray emitting constituents for all but the nearest galaxies .",
    "_ rosat _ improved the resolution by about three times , providing views of a broader range galaxies outside the local group ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the use of _ chandra _ and",
    "_ xmm - newton _ has led to more detections because of the large effective area of _ xmm - newton _ and the sharp point spread function of",
    "_ chandra_.",
    "ngc 6946 is a well - studied face - on spiral initially detected in x - rays with the _ einstein observatory _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a 36-ksec pointing using the _ rosat _ pspc , detected 9 point sources , and reported the existence of a diffuse component with a temperature of 0.55 kev ( 90% error range of 0.3 - 0.65 kev ) which we will show just overlaps with the results to be presented .",
    "that study argued that the diffuse component was truly diffuse and not the summed emission of point sources based upon a plausibility argument for the expected numbers of sources of various types . in a separate study , @xcite described a _",
    "hri observation as well as an observation using _",
    "asca_. in this case , the high internal background of the hri prevented a detection of the diffuse component , while the broad psf of the _ asca _ mirrors blended events from the known point sources with the diffuse emission .",
    "this paper describes the diffuse emission in ngc 6946 revealed by a 60-ksec _ chandra _ observation of the galaxy .",
    "the point source population has been described by @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is a spectrum of the diffuse emission . following this introduction",
    ", we describe our analysis steps , then present a brief comparison of the diffuse emission with images from other bandpasses , followed by a longer analysis of the spectral fits and a discussion of the results .",
    "_ chandra _ presents a unique opportunity to observe the diffuse component as free as may be possible , at least for the foreseeable future , from contamination by point sources .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "mirrors deliver @xmath480% of the x - rays at 1 kev into a circle @xmath40.7 arcsec in radius and 70% into a 0.7 arcsec radius circle at 6 kev . at 5@xmath5 off - axis , the corresponding numbers are 90% into a circle of a radius @xmath42@xmath6.5 at 1 kev and @xmath44@xmath6 radius at 6 kev @xcite .",
    "the adopted distance for ngc 6946 is 5.9 mpc @xcite with a corresponding scale of 1@xmath6 @xmath429 pc .",
    "the column density in the direction of ngc 6946 is @xmath43 - 5@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ observed ngc 6946 on 2001 september 7 .",
    "the galaxy was imaged on the back - illuminated ( bi ) chip s3 .",
    "the data were examined for flares to which the bi chip is susceptible , but no flares with a count rate greater than 0.04 counts s@xmath10 were located ; screening any flare - like spikes removed 1296 sec of the 59116 sec observation , leaving a net on - source , deadtime - corrected , exposure of 57819 sec .    the data were filtered to eliminate events with energies below 0.3 kev and above 8 kev .",
    "the low - energy cut does not remove source photons because those events are lost to the high column in the direction of the galaxy .",
    "the high cut removes extraneous cosmic ray - generated events .    while the internal background of the acis detector is low ( for s3 , @xmath40.3 counts s@xmath10 chip@xmath10 , @xcite ) and often may be ignored for counts from point sources extracted with a typical detection cell a few arc sec in size , the large extent of the galaxy and the faintness of the diffuse emission require a careful analysis of the background .",
    "the d@xmath11 circle circle is the diameter of the optical isophote at a surface brightness of 25 mag / arcsec@xmath12 . ]",
    "is @xmath414 arcmin in size @xcite and is larger than the acis s3 ccd .",
    "the large extent of the galaxy prevents the use of portions of the s3 chip outside of the galaxy as a measure of the background .",
    "we instead obtained the background from a `` blank field '' observation .",
    "the data were filtered identically by energy , then re - projected onto the sky using the aspect solution of the actual ngc 6946 observation .",
    "the exposure time of the background observation was @xmath4300 ksec .",
    "point sources were detected as described in @xcite , using a wavelet detection that is directly tied to the point spread function s behavior with off - axis angle @xcite .",
    "the point source detection reached a limiting luminosity l@xmath13 @xmath43@xmath710@xmath14 erg s@xmath10 in the 0.3 - 5 kev band which corresponded to @xmath410 counts .",
    "@xcite deemed the source detection complete to @xmath41@xmath710@xmath15 erg s@xmath10 ; the completeness limit is lower by @xmath430% near the center of the ccd because of the sharper point spread function there where @xmath47 - 8 counts constitutes a detection .",
    "most of the detected diffuse emission lies within 2.5 - 3 arcmin of the aimpoint .",
    "we do not see a trend of increasing numbers of weak sources as we approach the aimpoint , suggesting a relative lack of contamination of the diffuse emission by weak point sources .",
    "we postpone until  5 a longer discussion of the impact of possible unresolved point sources .",
    "sources were removed from the data using the ciao tool dmfilth which cuts out each source , then replaces the resulting ` hole ' by sampling the events in annuli surrounding the locations of the sources .",
    "the extraction apertures used enclosed @xmath1695% of the encircled energy .",
    "the annuli had inner radii 25% larger than the radii of the source extraction circles .",
    "care was taken to ensure that the annular sampling did not include any source events .",
    "figure  [ fullobs ] shows the results of all the steps just described : the energy - filtered data , minus point sources , and binned into 4-arcsec pixels . immediately from the raw data ( figure  [ fullobs ] ) we see the diffuse emission as well as bright areas , particularly on the n and w arms and surrounding the nucleus .",
    "we then adaptively smoothed the data using the ciao code csmooth .",
    "we adopted a gaussian smoothing kernel and selected the smoothing parameter to be 3@xmath17 as calculated locally .",
    "finally , we subtracted a constant from the result to remove the overall background as determined by the ` blank field ' background .",
    "figure  [ mosaic ] shows the results in the three bands .",
    "the 0.3 - 0.6 kev band shows little emission specific to ngc 6946 because of the high column in the galaxy s direction .",
    "the 0.6 - 0.9 and 0.9 - 2 kev bands appear similar : contours fall in similar regions of the galaxy in each band . in the 0.9 - 2 kev image , the apparent emission that extends beyond the region defined by the 0.6 - 0.9 kev image is an artifact of the adaptive smoothing , driven by the lower counts in the 0.9 - 2 kev band .",
    "we henceforth use just the 0.6 - 0.9 kev band for any comparisons .",
    "the `` point sources '' apparent in this figure do _ not _ correspond with any of the detected sources listed in @xcite , nor do they correspond with point sources lying below the threshold .",
    "an examination of the raw data at full resolution shows a broad distribution of counts suggestive of a diffuse but clumpy source .",
    "in this section we compare the x - ray image of the diffuse emission with images obtained in other bandpasses .",
    "the apparent `` point sources '' discussed at the end of the previous section do not correspond to any of the optically - identified supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "the regions may correspond with prominent h  ii regions identified in the submillimeter band by @xcite .",
    "the extracted counts from these regions yield luminosities of @xmath41.5@xmath710@xmath15 erg s@xmath10 using a simple thermal bremsstrahlung model with temperature of 0.3 kev (  4.4 ) .",
    "figure  [ figxhalf ] shows the contours of the 0.6 - 0.9 kev emission overlaid on an h@xmath0 image .",
    "note that in general the x - rays follow the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this behavior is most easily visible on the prominent northern arm or at the sharp south - southeast edge .",
    "the weak arm to the northwest is not detected ; nor is the weaker portion of the inner eastern arm .",
    "the matching behavior means that the x - ray emission arises from a hot diffuse ism component or from the summed emission of point sources confined to the arms .",
    "we will return to this question in the discussion section .",
    "figure  [ figxpi ] shows the 0.6 - 0.9 kev x - ray contours over the 6-cm polarized intensity map from @xcite and discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the regular magnetic field is strongest in the _ interarm _ region .",
    "in the previous figure , we established that the x - ray emission follows the northern arm .",
    "as in @xcite , it is clear the polarized emission lies external to that arm , so the x - ray image is consistent with their result .",
    "figure  [ figx850 ] shows the 0.6 - 0.9 kev x - ray contours overlaid on the 850 @xmath18 m map of @xcite . at 850 @xmath18 m , the nucleus as well as 3 knots of emission are prominent ; the knots lie to the northeast , east , and south - southeast of the nucleus .",
    "overall , the regions of strongest x - ray emission correspond with the regions brightest at 850 @xmath18 m .",
    "these knots correspond to prominent h ii regions .",
    "the 850 @xmath18 m emission largely arises from dust heated by starlight and thermally radiating ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 cm ] displays the 0.6 - 0.9 kev x - ray contours on the 3 cm thermal radio emission ( available in @xcite ) . in general , knots of x - ray emission",
    "align with the radio knots , particularly on the ne arm .",
    "a longer x - ray exposure is required to ascertain whether the outer regions in the 3 cm image have a corresponding x - ray counterpart .",
    "for all of the analysis , we fit the spectra of the diffuse emission @xmath19 background and the background simultaneously .",
    "this introduction describes the extraction of the spectra and a fit to the background .",
    "two approaches are generally used to extract a spectrum spread across a large expanse of the acis chips : ( i ) extract the data as small arrays , build a response matrix specific to each array , and sum the arrays ; or ( ii ) correct the entire chip for the charge transfer inefficiencies ( cti ) , extract a single source@xmath19background spectrum , and construct one response matrix ( the penn state approach , using the cti corrector as described in @xcite ) .",
    "we adopted the second method .",
    "a correction for the time - dependent contamination was included by reducing the effective area at each affected energy .",
    "following the removal of the point sources , the spectrum of the diffuse emission@xmath19background was extracted including all pixels within the s3 chip and with exposure @xmath160.9 of the on - axis time ( this eliminates edge effects ) .",
    "a total of 28248 counts were extracted representing the spectrum of the source plus background .",
    "a background spectrum was extracted from the reprojected blank field observation using the same ( x , y ) image pixels as for ngc 6946 itself .",
    "the background spectrum contained 331600 counts and 22334 counts after scaling the exposure time to that of ngc 6946 .",
    "the source spectrum was adaptively binned so that the resulting spectrum contained at least 20 counts per channel .",
    "figure  [ figovrly ] shows the two extracted spectra as an overlay . from this figure",
    ", it is clear that the galaxy s diffuse emission fades into the background near 2 kev and is blocked below @xmath40.5 kev by the column toward ngc 6946 .",
    "this figure reinforces one s visual impression as well as quantitative expectation : most of the visually apparent emission appears in the 1 - 2 kev band where _ chandra _ s effective area takes on the largest values .",
    "the visible ` emission lines ' arise from particle background stimulation of material in the detectors ; the large line at 1.8 kev is si k@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two spectra of figure  [ figovrly ] represents the net diffuse spectrum and contains 5914 counts .",
    "figure  [ spec_bkgrd ] shows a fit to the background using a number of power law and gaussian components .",
    "the residuals are flat to within @xmath415% across the bandpass .",
    "we use this background model in all subsequent spectral fitting , freezing the parameters at their best - fit values .",
    "we justify this approach by noting the background spectrum may be fitted to very high precision , it having been accumulated from numerous long exposures .",
    "simple continuum models did not provide a good fit and in all cases left clear residuals .",
    "for example , the use of a single mekal model produced the lowest @xmath20 of 1.21 of all the _ single_-component models , but left clear residuals in the 0.9 kev band .",
    "the residuals essentially force consideration of additional degrees of freedom .",
    "four models provided essentially comparable goodness - of - fit values . at the interpretation stage , we will use the results from one or more models because any one of them could be deemed `` correct . ''",
    "first , we adopted a double ` mekal ' spectral model representing thermal emission from a diffuse gas as calculated by @xcite and @xcite with fe l calculations supplied by @xcite .",
    "second ( and third ) , we used single and dual variable abundance mekal models , allowing the abundances of species with lines in the 0.5 - 2 kev band to vary .",
    "last , we fit the spectrum with a simple thermal bremsstrahlung to define the continuum and included as many gaussian lines as required by the data . for the multi - gaussian approach ,",
    "the choice of continuum model is largely irrelevant , as any simple model will produce a fit . a power law , for example , works as well as a bremsstrahlung model ( the resulting index is a steep @xmath47@xmath10.55 , 90% error )",
    "; we adopt the bremsstrahlung model to provide a check on the fitted temperatures from the more complex models . for the gaussian lines , we set their widths to zero , because the lines are unresolved with acis but broadened by the instrumental response , and their centers to the positions of expected lines (  [ seclineemis ] ) .",
    "the multi - gaussian approach provides information on the ionization states contributing to the total emission .",
    "figure  [ figspec ] ( top ) shows the dual variable mekal fit while the bottom figure shows the multi - gauss fit .",
    "we also included a power law component to account for any excess emission between the source plus background and background spectra .",
    "the residual flux from this power law ` background ' component is @xmath216% of the total diffuse flux , verifying the quality of the background definition and its separation from the diffuse emission of ngc 6946 .",
    "table  [ specfit ] lists the parameters for the fitted models .",
    "the continuum temperatures of the single continuum models or the _ low _ temperature component of the dual models are identical within the errors with kt @xmath40.25 - 0.32 kev .",
    "figure  [ cont_vmekal ] ( top ) shows the variable mekal model contours for the low - temperature component .",
    "the fitted column density is also identical within the errors for all models with a range of 3.6 - 4.1@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "these columns lie about a factor of 2 above the dickey & lockman column ( @xmath42@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 , @xcite ) but within the errors of the @xcite value of @xmath43 - 5@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath9 .    the integrated flux in the 0.5 - 2 kev band is @xmath43.7@xmath710@xmath22 ergs s@xmath10 @xmath9 ( absorbed ) or @xmath42.5@xmath710@xmath23 ( unabsorbed ) .",
    "the integrated luminosity values are @xmath41.5@xmath710@xmath24 and @xmath41@xmath710@xmath25 erg s@xmath10 , respectively , or @xmath42.9@xmath710@xmath15 and @xmath41.9@xmath710@xmath26 erg s@xmath10 arcmin@xmath27 , respectively .",
    "these values differ somewhat from previous measurements .",
    "measure of the column was low by about a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "the fitted temperature is also lower than the _ rosat _ pspc value of 0.55@xmath28 kev ; even though the error bars just overlap , the higher temperature behavior of the _ rosat _ fit is not unexpected .",
    "the fitted temperature , for example , from the pspc data was almost certainly artificially high because it included photons from sources with harder spectra , such as x - ray binaries , that were incompletely removed .",
    "in addition ,  [ alldiff ] shows that two spectral components are required for a good fit with one at kt @xmath40.7 while the pspc data were consistent with a single temperature because of the detector s lower spectral resolution .",
    "the integrated flux is higher than the _ rosat _ value by @xmath425% , as is expected given the higher value for the column density . as an aside , the very broad psf of the _ asca _ mirrors prohibited an analysis of the diffuse emission from the ngc 6946 observation @xcite .",
    "the abundances of the single variable mekal model were first varied individually to test the size of the resulting error .",
    "an abundance , for which the 1 @xmath17 error was consistent with 1.0 , was reset to and fixed at 1.0 .",
    "two abundances ( si , fe ) were found to differ significantly from 1 ( figure  [ mek_cont ] ) .",
    "for fe , the abundance is 0.67@xmath10.13 solar at the 99% level . for si ,",
    "the abundance is 3.0 with the 90% contour just above 1.0 at 1.05 ; at 99% , the si abundance is consistent with solar .",
    "no flares occurred during the observation , so the line is unlikely instrumental in origin .",
    "we return to this point momentarily .",
    "the gaussian centers were fixed at the energies of potentially prominent lines , corresponding to o  vii 0.57 kev , o  viii 0.653 kev , fe  i ( l ) 0.705 kev , fe  xvii 0.826 kev , ne  ix 0.922 kev , fe  xx 0.996 kev , ne  x 1.022 kev , and mg  xi 1.34 kev .",
    "lines at energies lower than @xmath40.5 kev were deemed irrelevant because of the high column toward ngc 6946 .",
    "several lines were significantly detected at @xmath1699% ( table  [ specfit ] ) . at the energies of these lines ,",
    "the acis spectral resolution is @xmath4110 - 120 ev @xcite .    while we fixed the line centers at specific energies to test for the presence or absence of known lines , we relaxed that requirement for the si line to test whether the feature in the source@xmath19background spectrum was consistent with the background feature .",
    "the background line is best fit with a gaussian at 1.775@xmath10.002 kev ( blend of si k@xmath0 ) while the diffuse si line has a best - fit energy of 1.860@xmath10.027 kev (= si xiii ) .",
    "assume for the moment the spectral fits are accurate measures of the line emission .",
    "the presence of o  vii and o  viii then provides a measure of the overall ionization in the diffuse emission .",
    "o  viii 0.653 kev is the ly@xmath29 transition ; the blended o  vii 0.57 line(s ) represent the 1s2p to 1s@xmath12 transition .",
    "the log of the ratio is -0.2@xmath10.7 and has a large error because of the decreasing continuum in the 0.5 - 0.6 kev band and because of the energy resolution of the ccd .",
    "nevertheless , the ratio translates to limits of 9.6 @xmath21 log n@xmath30 t @xmath2112.0 , where n@xmath30 represents the electron density and t the cooling time ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "if the low ` vmekal ' continuum temperature approximately represents the electron temperature , then it plus the line ratio restrict the o  vii resonance / forbidden ratio to @xmath210.6 - 0.8 , a prediction for future observations using instruments with higher energy resolution .",
    "the values are just barely consistent with ionization equilibrium and suggest non - equilibrium conditions exist in the diffuse medium of ngc 6946 particularly given the lack of a good fit by the various equilibrium ionization models .",
    "for the just - described electron temperature and line ratio values , equilibrium requires n@xmath30",
    "t @xmath3112.5 - 13.0 . lower values for the electron temperature plus lower values for the interpreted line ratio push the estimated resonance / forbidden ratio toward higher values and increasing equilibrium conditions ; for a given line ratio , higher electron temperatures indicate increasing non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "a recent paper by @xcite presents the _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectrum of gas in m81 .",
    "we note that the spectrum shows the same resolved oxygen emission lines with a ratio of @xmath40.65 , indicating non - equilibrium conditions exist in the ism of m81 . while we acknowledge that the diffuse emission in ngc 6946 requires study with an instrument possessing higher spectral resolution at a spatial resolution comparable to _ chandra _ s to confirm our analysis , the similarity between the line ratio in the rgs spectrum and our upper limit argues for non - equilibrium conditions in the ism of both galaxies .    a similar analysis using ne  ix and ne  x",
    "can not be carried out because the neon emission is blended with fe xix and fe xx .",
    "the m81 spectrum of page et al .",
    "in fact illustrates that the blend occurs even at the resolution of the rgs .    a deeper x - ray exposure will be necessary to provide sufficient events to tighten the line ratio and continuum temperature values to strengthen the non - equilibrium suggestion .",
    "a future mission with high spatial and spectral resolution is necessary to demonstrate conclusively whether the diffuse emission exists in a non - equilibrium condition by measuring the resonance / forbidden ratio of the o vii lines .",
    "the expected large point spread function of _ astro - e2 _ will blur too many point sources into the diffuse emission to provide such a good measure .      as an experiment",
    ", we extracted a spectrum of the diffuse emission in the knots visible in the smoothed images as well as a spectrum of the diffuse emission minus the knot emission . figure  [ fignoknot ] shows the results .",
    "the spectrum of the ` no knot ' diffuse emission is essentially identical to the complete spectrum discussed previously .",
    "this is not particularly surprising given the relatively bright emission distributed over the face of the galaxy and the relatively small number of events in the knots .",
    "the lower portion of the figure shows the knot emission itself .",
    "we fit the spectrum to obtain the column and continuum temperature with a single variable mekal model , then fit for line abundances as well as using gaussians to represent emission lines ( as shown in the figure ) .",
    "table  [ specfit2 ] lists the model parameters .",
    "the background forms an inconsequential portion of the flux given the small spatial coverage of the knots .",
    "the abundances show enhanced si but depleted o , ne , and fe .",
    "gaussian line centers correspond to o , si , and fe ; the fourth line at @xmath40.95 kev is most likely a blend of ne ix and fe xx .",
    "the integrated flux of the knot emission is @xmath43@xmath710@xmath22 erg s@xmath10 @xmath9 or about 510% of the original diffuse emission .",
    "the spectra of the point sources with sufficient counts to yield good spectral fits , @xmath32 @xmath211.3 for @xmath3350 , are uniformly harder than the diffuse spectrum presented here @xcite .",
    "the lowest temperature of the best - fit bremsstrahlung models for the point sources is @xmath41.9 kev .",
    "similarly , the best - fit power law indices are typically @xmath42 - 3 ; the steepest value is 4.9@xmath10.4 versus the power law index fit to the diffuse emission of 7@xmath10.55 (  [ alldiff ] ) .",
    "these results all support the presence of a distinct spectral component distributed across the galaxy .",
    "@xcite argued that the detection of the diffuse emission represented the hot ism component and not the summed emission of point sources based upon a plausibility argument from the known luminosities of typical constituents .",
    "the argument is strengthened here because of the improved separation of point sources and diffuse emission as well as the deeper probe of the luminosity distribution of the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "@xcite detected 72 point sources to @xmath47@xmath710@xmath14 erg s@xmath10 and judged it complete to @xmath410@xmath15 erg s@xmath10 which is a factor of @xmath410 deeper than the pspc data and a factor of @xmath47 deeper than the hri image ( @xcite ) .",
    "our argument can be strengthened still further by extrapolating the luminosity distribution to an arbitrary , low value of l@xmath13 .",
    "we adopt the luminosity distribution of holt et al . but eliminate from that distribution any sources not detected in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "a total of 7 sources are removed .",

    ", we obtain the lower bound on the diffuse luminosity , @xmath41.1@xmath710@xmath24 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "of the events described in this paper as ` diffuse ' then , up to @xmath425% could originate in unresolved point sources below the detection threshold , leaving @xmath475% for the hot component of the ism of ngc 6946 .",
    "the above discussion assumes the lack of a yet - steeper contribution from the unresolved point sources .",
    "we can not assess the impact of such a component but note in defense of our argument that the luminosity distribution of the milky way does not contain evidence for the existence of such a component @xcite .",
    "the unresolved point source contribution may very well be less than our 25% estimate . @xcite estimate the number of sources above 10@xmath35 erg s@xmath10 in the milky way as @xmath4700 with a possible factor of 2 uncertainty . for ngc 6946",
    ", our extrapolation leads to @xmath43800 sources above 10@xmath35 erg s@xmath10 , a factor of 5 greater than the milky way .",
    "if the extrapolation for ngc 6946 lies closer to the milky way observations , the unresolved point contribution likewise drops , perhaps by as much as a factor of 2 .",
    "of course , this argument could equally well be pushed in the opposite direction by a similar factor because ngc 6946 is not a clone of the milky way .",
    "for example , ngc 6946 is extremely co - rich , radio - bright , and undergoing very active star formation @xcite .",
    "if we doubled the unresolved point source contribution , our estimate for the hot ism contribution decreases to @xmath450% of the x - rays presented here as the ` diffuse spectrum ' for a luminosity of @xmath47@xmath710@xmath26 erg s@xmath10 .    noting the caveats above but taking the original measurement at face value , our results represent a solid detection of the hot diffuse component from ngc 6946 free of any concerns over the resolved sources point spread function wings that plagued results from _ rosat _ , for example @xcite .",
