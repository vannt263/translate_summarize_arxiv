    "these relations were given in and are repeated below for the convenience of the reader .",

    "consequently , the expressions for the @xmath75 in terms of the @xmath74 can be written in numerous equivalent ways depending on the choice of independent quantities .",

    "one way to avoid this inconvenience is to eliminate either @xmath97 or @xmath216 in favor of @xmath88 .",

    "<S> we consider cp - conserving two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdms ) of type  i and type  ii near the alignment limit in which the lighter of the two cp - even higgs bosons , @xmath0 , is the sm - like state observed at @xmath1 . in particular , we focus on the 2hdm parameter regime where the coupling of @xmath0 to gauge bosons approaches that of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> we review the theoretical structure and analyze the phenomenological implications of the regime of alignment limit without decoupling , in which the other higgs scalar masses are not significantly larger than @xmath2 and thus do not decouple from the effective theory at the electroweak scale . for the numerical analysis , we perform scans of the 2hdm parameter space employing the software packages ` 2hdmc ` and ` lilith ` , taking into account all relevant pre - lhc constraints , the latest constraints from the measurements of the @xmath1 higgs signal at the lhc , as well as the most recent limits coming from searches for heavy higgs - like states . </S>",
    "<S> we contrast these results with the alignment limit achieved via the decoupling of heavier scalar states , where @xmath0 is the only light higgs scalar . </S>",
    "<S> implications for run  2 at the lhc , including expectations for observing the other scalar states , are also discussed .    </S>",
