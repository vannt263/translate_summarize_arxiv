    "the observations indicate that outflow is ubiquitous in the star formation process , and flows from the protostars have two or more distinct velocity components @xcite .",
    "typically , a flow from the protostar is composed of a low - velocity component ( lvc ) with 10 - 50@xmath7 and a high - velocity component ( hvc ) with @xmath6@xmath8 .",
    "there is a clear trend toward higher collimation at higher flow velocity @xcite . since flows from the protostar have various morphological and kinematical properties ,",
    "they can not be explained by a single - class model .",
    "the flows that originated from the protostar are typically classified into two types : molecular outflow observed mainly with co molecules @xcite , and optical jet observed by optical emission @xcite .",
    "molecular outflows observed by co line emission exhibit a wide opening angle @xcite and slower velocity of @xmath9 @xcite , while optical jets observed by optical emission exhibit good collimation and higher velocity of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that around each protostar , high - speed jets with a narrow opening angle are enclosed by a low - velocity outflow with a wide opening angle @xcite .",
    "however , the driving mechanism of these flows are still unknown .    in this study , we calculate cloud evolution from the molecular cloud core ( @xmath11 , @xmath12au ) to stellar core formation ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) using three - dimensional resistive mhd nested grid method , study the formation process of jets and outflows , and show the driving mechanisms of these flows .",
    "our initial settings are almost the same as those of @xcite .",
    "we solve the resistive mhd equations including self - gravity ( see , eqs.1 - 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a spherical cloud with critical bonnor - ebert density profile having @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) of the central ( number ) density as the initial condition .",
    "the critical radius for a bonnor  ebert sphere @xmath17^{-1/2}$ ] corresponds to @xmath18au for our settings .",
    "initially , the cloud rotates rigidly ( @xmath19s@xmath20 ) around the @xmath21-axis and has a uniform magnetic field ( @xmath22@xmath23 g ) parallel to the @xmath21-axis ( or rotation axis ) . to promote contraction",
    ", we increase the density by 70% from the critical bonnor - ebert sphere .",
    "the initial central density is therefore @xmath24g@xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we adopt the nested grid method @xcite to obtain high spatial resolution near the center .",
    "each level of a rectangular grid has the same number of cells ( @xmath27 ) , although the cell width @xmath28 depends on the grid level @xmath29 .",
    "the highest level of a grid changes dynamically .",
    "the box size of the initial finest grid @xmath30 is chosen to be @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the radius of the critical bonnor  ebert sphere .",
    "a new finer grid is generated whenever the minimum local jeans length @xmath33 becomes smaller than @xmath34 .",

    "the structures of the jet ( @xmath36 ) and outflow ( @xmath37 ) are shown by iso - velocity surfaces , respectively .",
    "the density contours ( false color and contour lines ) , velocity vectors ( thin arrows ) on the mid - plane of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath400 are , respectively , projected in each wall surface .",

    "the molecular gas obeys the isothermal equation of state with temperature of @xmath41 k until @xmath42 ( isothermal phase ) , then cloud collapses almost adiabatically ( @xmath43 ; adiabatic phase ) and quasi - static core ( i.e. , first core ) forms during the adiabatic phase @xcite . in our calculations , the first core forms when the central density reaches @xmath44 .",
    "the magnetic flux is removed from the first core during the adiabatic phase by the ohmic dissipation @xcite .",
    "after central density reaches @xmath45 , the equation of state becomes soft reflecting the dissociation of hydrogen molecules at @xmath46 k , and collapses rapidly . by this epoch , the central temperature becomes so high that the thermal ionization of alkali metals reduces the resistivity and so that ohmic dissipation becomes ineffective .",
    "thus , the magnetic field becomes strong again as central region collapses .",
    "the second core ( or protostar ) @xcite forms at @xmath47 .",
    "the magnetic field strength increases rapidly after the second core formation epoch ( @xmath48 ) , because the shearing motion between the second core and ambient medium amplifies the toroidal magnetic field around the second core .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the structure of the low- and high - velocity flows , and the configuration of the magnetic field lines .",
    "it also shows the shapes of the first core ( left panel ; the projected density contours on the wall ) and the protostar ( right panel ; the red isosurface ) .",
    "the purple and blue surfaces in figure  [ fig:1 ] indicate the iso - velocity surface of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the flow inside the purple iso - velocity surface has a velocity of @xmath37 ( low - velocity component ; lvc ) , while the flow inside the blue iso - velocity surface has a velocity of @xmath51 ( high - velocity component ; hvc ) .",
    "the hvc is enclosed by the lvc .",
    "the lvc flow is mainly driven from the first core , while the hvc flow is mainly driven from the protostar .",
    "the lvc and hvc are strongly coiled by the magnetic field lines anchored to the first core and protostar , respectively .",
    "our results show that the flow appearing around the first core has a wide opening angle and slow speed , while the flow appearing around the protostar has a well - collimated structure and high speed , as shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the speed difference is caused by the difference of the depth in the gravitational potential .",
    "the flow speed corresponds to the kepler speed of each object .",
    "because the first core has a shallow gravitational potential , its flow is slower .",
    "the flow driven from the protostar , which has a deeper gravitational potential , has a high speed . in our calculations ,",
    "the low- and high - velocity flows have speeds of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "these speeds are slower than those of observations . typically , observed molecular outflow and optical jet have speeds of @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively . however , since the first and second cores ( protostar ) have mass of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , at the end of the calculations , each core increases its mass in the gas accretion phase .",
    "the kepler speed increases with the square root of the mass .",
    "when the mass of each core increases by 100 times , the kepler speed increases 10 times .",
    "thus , the speed of the low- and high - velocity flows may increase by 10 times , and reach @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , which correspond to typical observed values .",
    "observation shows that the molecular outflows have wide opening angles and low flow speeds , while the optical jets have good collimation and high flow speeds .",
    "molecular outflow has been considered to be entrained by the optical jet driven from a circumstellar disk around the protostar . in this study , we calculated the cloud evolution from the molecular cloud core to protostar formation , and found that two distinct flows are driven from different objects , and the observed features of molecular outflow and optical jet were naturally reproduced .",
    "thus , we expect that the low - velocity flow from the first core corresponds to the molecular outflow , while the high - velocity flow from the protostar corresponds to the optical jet .",
    "the different collimation of low- and high - velocity flow is caused both by the configuration of the magnetic field lines around the drivers and their driving mechanisms .",
    "the magnetic field lines around the first core have an hourglass configuration because they converge to the cloud center as the cloud collapses , and ohmic dissipation is ineffective before the first core formation .",
    "in addition , the centrifugal force is more dominant than the lorentz force in the low - velocity flow ( molecular outflow ) .",
    "thus , the flow appearing near the first core is mainly driven by the magnetocentrifugal wind mechanism ( disk wind ) .",
    "on the other hand , near the protostar , the magnetic field lines are a straight , and the magnetic pressure gradient mechanism is more effective for driving the high - velocity flow ( optical jet ) .",
    "the magnetic field lines straighten by the magnetic tension force near the protostar because the magnetic field is decoupled from the neutral gas . however , the magnetic field lines are strongly twisted in the region in close proximity to the protostar , where the magnetic field is coupled with the neutral gas again .",
    "thus , the strong toroidal field generated around the protostar can drive the high - velocity flow ( optical jet ) , which is guided by the straight configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "our calculations do not completely reject the well - known concept that the observed molecular outflow is entrained by the optical jet , because we calculate the formation of the jet and outflow only in the early star - formation phase .",
    "further long - term calculations are needed to understand the mechanism of the optical jet and molecular outflow in more detail .        [ 3 ] arce , h. g. , shepherd , d. , gueth , f. , lee , c .- f . , bachiller , r. , rosen , a. , & beuther , h. 2007 , in protostars and planets v , ed .",
