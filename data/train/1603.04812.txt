    "multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) channels have been attracting a great deal of interest in the last decades @xcite .",
    "mimo technologies , at the core of several wireless standards , improve spectral efficiency and reliability compared to single - input single - output ( siso ) systems . mimo system design has been usually posed under two different perspectives : either to increase data transmission rate through spatial multiplexing or to improvement system reliability through increased antenna diversity .",
    "spatial multiplexing is a simple mimo transmit technique that it does not require channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter and enables high spectral efficiency by splitting the incoming data into multiple independent substreams and transmitting each substream on a different antenna as in v - blast @xcite .",
    "when csi is available at the transmitter , channel - dependent linear or nonlinear transmit precoding ( beamforming ) of the data substreams can further improve the performance by adapting the transmitted signal to the instantaneous channel state @xcite . in this case , employing multiuser mimo techniques allows for a gain in sum capacity obtained by channel reuse @xcite .",
    "although channel reuse for multiple users is advantageous in terms of throughput , when multiple uncoordinated links share a common communications medium , e.g. , in a broadcast system , co - channel interference caused by the transmission of multiple users data on the same carrier frequency could limit channel reuse @xcite .",
    "most wireless systems avoid interference by orthogonalizing the communication links in time or frequency .",
    "it is clear that this approach could be suboptimal since it entails a priori loss of degrees of freedom in both links independent of the amount of interference .",
    "power control , precoding , and scheduling techniques , with capability of reducing interference , are conventional solutions to the co - channel interference problem @xcite . from a practical point of view , using multiple antennas to communicate with many users simultaneously is especially appealing in wireless local area network ( wlan ) environments , wimax , and other time - division duplex ( tdd ) systems where channel conditions can readily be learned by all parties @xcite .",
    "classically , a beamformer or precoder controls the beam pattern of an antenna array by weighting antennas to satisfy predetermined optimization criteria .",
    "many precoding methods aim at maximizing throughput .",
    "however , as pointed out by palomar et al .",
    "@xcite , the problem with this type of criterion is that it implicitly presumes that an unrealizable ideal continuous gaussian code is used instead of a signal constellation . in practice",
    ", the transmitter sends a modulated signal with a practical suboptimal channel coding scheme which together determine system throughput . signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) , mean square error ( mse ) between the desired signal and the array output , and signal to leakage ratio ( slr ) are other common criteria in formulating the precoding optimization problem @xcite .",
    "however , in the communications scenario considered here , the probability of error or achievable bit error rate ( ber ) is the system performance metric that maximizes capacity for bpsk transmission @xcite .",
    "therefore , designing the transmit precoder to directly minimize the error probability would result in improved system performance .",
    "the error probability of each user in a multiuser downlink system depends on the modulation type . therefore , to design a precoder that minimizes error probability , one ought to account for the modulation type which is not considered in classical precoding methods such as minimum mean square error ( mmse ) , maximum signal to leakage and noise ratio ( mslnr ) , and block diagonalization ( bd ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", it is established that by incorporating modulation type in the precoder design , system performance may be significantly improved .    as additional motivation ,",
    "low data rate bpsk modulation is a commonly employed transmission mode in adaptive wireless systems such as ieee 802.11a , n , ac , when snr is low @xcite . moreover ,",
    "emerging technologies such as internet of things ( iot ) require simultaneous deployment of a massive number of low data rate devices , which serves as another motivation for employing bpsk modulation @xcite .",
    "finally , in current wifi systems such as 802.11ac , the transmit precoding is considered as a selectable adaptive `` mimo mode '' in addition to modulation type , which naturally motivates coupling of transmit precoding to modulation .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "selecting a subset of users for transmission in a broadcast channel , is another conventional method to reduce co - channel interference and increase system throughput and reliability .",
    "gains in throughput and reliability are also obtained by multiuser diversity via user selection when the number of users is large . although the optimal user subset can be found by brute - force search over all possible combinations of user subsets , its computational complexity is prohibitive . in practice ,",
    "low - complexity scheduling algorithms are desired @xcite .",
    "for example in @xcite , algorithms based on semi - orthogonal user selection ( sus ) are presented , which are developed for zero - forcing precoding . when sus is combined with zero - forcing precoding and water filling power allocation , although overall suboptimal",
    ", it can achieve the same asymptotic ( high snr ) sum rate as that of dirty paper coding for broadcast channel , as the number of users goes to infinity . in @xcite , a greedy user selection algorithm",
    "is proposed based on bd precoding and increases total throughput of users . in this paper",
    ", we propose a user selection algorithm for mpe precoding that semi - greedily selects the set of users by a geometric approach such that the number of selected users is made as large as possible .",
    "it is shown that for a one - dimensional modulation such as binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) , it is possible to utilize extra dimensions provided by the complex channel and transmit information at the same time and frequency to more users than the number of transmit antennas .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a new multiuser transmit precoder that minimizes the probability of error is proposed for bpsk signalling in the multiuser multiple input single output ( miso ) broadcast channel for the following scenarios : ( i ) single - user maximum likelihood detection at the receivers , and ( ii ) joint transmit precoding and receive filtering .",
    "2 .   a low - complexity geometric user selection ( gus ) algorithm is developed for mpe transmit precoding , which can select more simultaneous users than the number of transmit antennas .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ secsysmodel_bpsk ] , the system model is introduced . in section [ secpe_bpsk ] , the error probability of a user in the downlink of a multiuser system",
    "is calculated assuming the transmitter is using bpsk modulation and linear precoding for transmission .",
    "section [ secmpe_bpsk ] presents the minimum probability of error ( mpe ) transmit precoding considering two different scenarios .",
    "first , it is assumed that the receiver uses a single - user maximum likelihood detector .",
    "second , it is assumed that the transmit precoding weights and the receive filter coefficients are calculated jointly at the transmitter . in both scenarios we try to transform the precoding optimization problem to convex optimization subproblems and present algorithms for finding the precoding vectors of users . in section [ secuserselection_bpsk ] , by taking a geometric approach , a user selection algorithm compatible with mpe precoding is presented .",
    "numerical results are demonstrated in section [ secresults_bpsk ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ secconclusion_bpsk ] .",
    "we consider a broadcast system with one transmitter and @xmath0 receivers ( users ) . later in section [ secuserselection_bpsk ]",
    ", it is shown that these @xmath0 users are preselected out of @xmath1 total available users by the proposed algorithm in section [ secuserselection_bpsk ] .",
    "the system model is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "it is assumed that the transmitter consists of an array of antennas with @xmath2 elements and each receiver @xmath3 , has one antenna in its array .",
    "it is also assumed that the transmitter has one symbol encoded in @xmath4 for each receiver @xmath5 , @xmath6 to be transmitted in the same time and frequency slots .",
    "the transmitter uses an @xmath7 precoding vector @xmath8 to encode the transmitted symbols intended for receiver @xmath5 . ignoring the noise at the transmitter s output , and assuming that the transmitter has information symbols for all of the @xmath0 preselected receivers we can model the @xmath7 transmitted signal vector as @xmath9 where @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11^t$ ] .",
    "the channel matrix between @xmath2 antennas of the transmitter and the single antenna of receiver @xmath5 can be represented by the @xmath12 vector @xmath13 with entries following an independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "this channel model is valid for narrow - band ( frequency non - selective ) systems if the transmit and receive antennas are in non line - of - sight rich - scattering environments with sufficient antenna spacing @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that we follow the same vector representation of the channel as @xcite , i.e. , representing the channels with row vectors in miso systems .",
    "+    at receiver @xmath5 the received signal can be modeled as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a cscg noise with zero mean and variance @xmath16 .    at receiver @xmath5",
    "the received signal is processed by a filter .",
    "therefore the output at the receiver @xmath5 can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the complex - valued filter coefficient at receiver @xmath5 and @xmath19 is complex gaussian noise with variance @xmath20 .",
    "we also express @xmath21 as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 to emphasize its dependence on these parameters .",
    "to calculate the error probability of each user in a broadcast channel one needs to know the estimation technique that the receiver is using in addition to the modulation type .",
    "motivated by the facts that a low dimensional modulation like bpsk is employed in wireless systems such as ieee 802.11a , n , ac , and it is often selected in systems with adaptive modulation when snr is low , we assume bpsk modulation for all users @xcite . it is also assumed that the system operates with the following decision rule for estimating the transmitted symbols of user @xmath5 when the output noise is additive white gaussian : @xmath24 where the superscript @xmath25 denotes taking the real part operation , i.e. , @xmath26 .    here , the error probability of each user @xmath27 is calculated as a function of its receive filter coefficient and its transmit precoding weight vector as well as the transmit precoding weight vectors of all other users ( @xmath28 ) . later in section [ secmpe_bpsk ]",
    ", we use this probability of error to calculate precoding weights for two different scenarios , namely , a scenario in which each receiver estimates the transmitted signal according to a classical single - user maximum likelihood scheme without relying on knowledge of other channels , and a scenario with joint transmit precoding and receive filtering in which both of the receive filtering and transmit precoding weights are calculated at the transmitter and then the calculated receive filter coefficient of each user is provided to its receiver via the forward channel .",
    "the error probability at the output of receiver @xmath5 is expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the probability of an event .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath33 , i.e. , the transmitted bpsk modulated signal @xmath34 takes its elements from the set @xmath35 with equal probability , which could be the result of source compression and hard decision .",
    "it should be remarked that , using uniform rather than gaussian distribution over signal sets causes an asymptotic loss in throughput which could be compensated to some extent by using constellation shaping techniques @xcite .",
    "the symmetry in the estimation of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for user @xmath5 is also considered , which is the result of the symmetry between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the probability density function ( pdf ) , and consequently results in @xmath41 .",
    "since the number of constellation points in bpsk is two , @xmath42 is the number of possible symbol sequences for all @xmath0 users in one transmission , i.e. , there could be @xmath43 different possible sets of @xmath0-tuple symbols @xmath44 for @xmath0 users . for bpsk transmission ,",
    "we denote @xmath45 as the number of possible symbol sequences for transmission if the transmitted symbol of user @xmath5 is already known for example to be @xmath36 .    using equal probability for transmission of bpsk constellation points , and additive gaussian output noise @xmath46",
    ", we have @xmath47 where in the first equality , using total probability theorem , the conditional output probability at receiver @xmath5 is again conditioned over all @xmath48 possible assignments of transmitted symbols @xmath49 . also @xmath50 is @xmath51 when @xmath52 is transmitted , i.e. , @xmath53 therefore , the probability of error can be calculated as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath5th symbol of @xmath52 and @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 .",
    "in this section , our objective is to minimize the weighted sum of error probabilities for two different scenarios :    1 .",
    "first scenario- the receiver only needs its own channel information to calculate its filter coefficient and there is no need for extra feedback .",
    "it is assumed that the receivers use ml detection .",
    "we try to minimize the weighted sum of error probabilities only over transmit precoding weights since each receive filter coefficient could be expressed as a function of transmit precoding weights .",
    "this method , while yielding suboptimal performance as compared to joint transmit precoding - receive filtering is nevertheless easier to practically realize .",
    "second scenario- we assume joint transmit precoding - receive filtering in which we minimize the error sum over both transmit precoding and receive filtering weights .",
    "this approach could be considered as the optimal method for communications in broadcast system when considering the error probability as the measure of quality .",
    "if one wants to minimize error probabilities of all users , it means that several objective functions have to be minimized which are all interdependent by the common transmit precoding matrix .",
    "a standard approach to this multiple - objective optimization problem is to combine the individual objective functions into a single composite function @xcite .",
    "similar to @xcite , we use the weighted average error probability of users @xmath58 . if @xmath59 for all users , i.e. , all users have the same priority , the weighted average turns to a simple average of the error probability of users in ( [ pej_joint ] ) as @xmath60 which is considerd as the system performance criterion hereafter .",
    "the parameters @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath23 have a bilinear dependence in the numerator of each @xmath62-function argument of ( [ avg_pe ] ) .",
    "now , we state the following constraints that are required in both forthcoming scenarios .",
    "[ lem_positive ] for the @xmath5th user not to have an error floor ( a rough lower bound on error probability ) , it is necessary for @xmath22 to comply with the following constraints : @xmath63    see appendix [ append_lem_positive ] .",
    "for the first scenario , it is assumed that the receivers use single - user maximum likelihood detection similar to @xcite . additionally , for the transmit precoding design the receive filtering weights",
    "are assumed to be available at the transmitter , because they could be calculated in closed - form at the transmitter . for ml detection the receive filter coefficient of a user can be expressed as a function of its transmit precoding vector and channel as @xcite @xmath64 consequently , the error probability of a user in ( [ pej_joint ] ) will be only a function of @xmath23 and so will be the average error probability of users in ( [ avg_pe ] ) : @xmath65 now , we try to minimize the average error probability @xmath66 by constraining the total transmit power .",
    "based on proposition [ lem_positive ] , the arguments of @xmath62-functions are constrained to be nonnegative .",
    "thus , the transmit precoding optimization problem is stated as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the total transmit power constraint .",
    "now , let us restate the transmit precoding vector @xmath8 of each user as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the amplitude of @xmath8 and @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72 . by using the cauchy - schwarz inequality the following upper bound on the error probability ( [ pe_ml ] )",
    "is obtained : @xmath73 the cauchy - schwarz inequality and therefore the upper bound is tight if @xmath74 , which can occur when all channels are orthogonal to each other .",
    "now , we minimize ( [ pe_ml_ub ] ) as follows :    [ ml_min_mod1 ] @xmath75    where @xmath76 $ ] and @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "we propose the alternating minimization algorithm of table [ table_ml ] which minimizes @xmath78 over @xmath79 and @xmath80 alternatingly to solve ( [ ml_min_mod1 ] ) .",

    "+ @xmath98 is the transmit precoding matrix .",
    "+     +    the algorithm iterates until the average error probability converges with the accuracy of @xmath99 . in minimization 1 of the proposed algorithm ,",
    "when ( [ ml_min_mod1_obj ] ) is minimized over @xmath79 , constraint ( [ ml_min_mod1_first_const ] ) does not depend on the minimization parameter and can be removed .",
    "similarly , in minimization 2 , when ( [ ml_min_mod1_obj ] ) is minimized over @xmath80 , constraints in ( [ ml_min_mod1_third_const ] ) are not included since they are independent of the optimization parameters .",
    "now , we observe that the alternating minimization algorithm has the following properties :    [ proper_convex_ml ] minimization 2 in table [ table_ml ] is a convex optimization problem .    see appendix [ append_proper_convex_ml ]    [ theo_converge_ml ] the algorithm presented in table [ table_ml ] converges to a local minimum of ( [ ml_min_mod1 ] ) .    the objective function @xmath100 is minimized in minimization 1 of table [ table_ml ] over @xmath79 while keeping @xmath80 fixed at the values obtained in minimization 2 of the previous iteration .",
    "therefore , at each iteration of the algorithm the value of the objective function after minimization 1 is non - increasing compared to the value of the objective function after minimization 2 of the previous iteration . in minimization 2 of table [ table_ml ] , @xmath100 is minimized over @xmath80 while keeping @xmath79 at the values obtained in minimization 1 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath78 does not increase compared to the result of minimization 1 of the same iteration . therefore",
    ", each iteration of the algorithm causes @xmath78 to be non - increasing .",
    "moreover , considering the fact that @xmath78 is always nonnegative , @xmath101 , guarantees that the algorithm converges to a stationary ( minimum ) point .",
    "for the second scenario , it is assumed that the receive filter coefficients are calculated by the transmitter in conjunction with the transmit precoding weights , and each receiver is provided with its receive filter coefficient . in this scenario ,",
    "the transmitter finds the transmit precoding weights and receive filter coefficients that minimize the average error probability of users .",
    "therefore , the joint mpe transmit precoding - receive filtering problem is represented by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the average error probability of ( [ avg_pe ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the error probability of user @xmath5 , @xmath104 in ( [ pej_joint ] ) , depends on its receive filter coefficient @xmath22 , and the transmit precoding matrix of all users @xmath23 , but it does not directly depend on the receive filter coefficients of other users does not depend on @xmath105 , it indirectly is coupled with them , because @xmath23 depends on all receive filters . ] . based on this observation",
    "we strive to develop an alternating minimization algorithm to solve ( [ joint_min ] ) . before developing the optimization algorithm",
    ", we determine key properties of ( [ pej_joint ] ) , ( [ avg_pe ] ) , and ( [ joint_min ] ) that will be utilized .",
    "[ proper_invariant ] the error probability in ( [ pej_joint ] ) and therefore the average error probability ( [ avg_pe ] ) are invariant to the scaling of @xmath106 by a positive constant .",
    "proof is obvious and therefore omitted .",
    "based on this property , one can set @xmath107 in the error probability of ( [ pej_joint ] ) and ( [ avg_pe ] ) and add @xmath108 as additional constraints to ( [ joint_min ] ) .",
    "[ proper_segment ] for a fixed @xmath23 that satisfies @xmath109 , we have @xmath110 $ ] . in other words , @xmath111 .",
    "this is obvious since each @xmath104 depends only on @xmath22 but not on @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , minimizing ( [ avg_pe ] ) over all @xmath22s could be partitioned into @xmath0 decoupled minimizations of @xmath104 over @xmath22s , for @xmath113 .",
    "if one wants to solve ( [ joint_min ] ) over @xmath114 for a given @xmath23 , it is clear from properties [ proper_invariant ] and [ proper_segment ] and proposition [ lem_positive ] that when there exists no error floor , without loss of generality , the constraints @xmath107 and ( [ eq_posit_constr ] ) , for @xmath113 , could be added to the optimization problem .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath23 , the @xmath0 optimization problems arising from ( [ joint_min ] ) could be rewritten as follows : @xmath115 for @xmath113 .",
    "now , we have the following proposition :    [ propos_unique_global_joint ] if the constraints in the minimization problem ( [ pej_min_equal ] ) are satisfied , any local minimizer of error probability function @xmath104 , i.e. , the objective function of the optimization problem ( [ pej_min_equal ] ) , is also a global minimizer .",

    "moreover , considering the fact that @xmath103 is always nonnegative , @xmath136 , it guarantees that the algorithm converges to a stationary ( minimum ) point .",
    "in this section , we develop a user selection algorithm by taking into account that mpe transmit precoding is utilized at the transmitter . it is assumed that in total @xmath1 users are in the system such that @xmath137 and the set of all users is given by @xmath138 . for a given time period ,",
    "the transmitter selects a subset , @xmath139 , of @xmath0 users out of @xmath1 users , @xmath140 , for transmission .",
    "the users should be selected in such a way that certain criteria are met .",
    "we are interested in maximizing the number of selected users and minimizing the error probabilities at the same time .",
    "since all users receive bpsk signals , maximizing the number of users may also increase the throughput .",
    "hence , ideally we would like to solve the following multiobjective optimization problem which , compared to ( [ joint_min_modified ] ) , only has an extra objective function : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the cardinality of the set of selected users . in the majority of existing user selection algorithms , e.g. @xcite , the number of selected users @xmath0 should be less than or equal to the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the system , which in this case is equal to the number of transmit antennas @xmath2 . however , in our proposed user selection algorithm , the number of selected users could be more than the dof of the system , as will be confirmed in the numerical results .",
    "the increase in the number of selected users is made possible because in the proposed user selection algorithm the constraints of the optimization ( [ multi_obj_user_selection ] ) originate from the mpe precoding problem which in turn exploits a one - dimensional discrete modulation rather than a continuous gaussian input distribution .",
    "practically , it is more suitable to solve the user selection and precoding problems separately .",
    "although suboptimal , ( [ multi_obj_user_selection ] ) is separated into a minimization over @xmath23 and @xmath114 and a maximization over @xmath143 . since the precoding problem has been addressed in section [ secmpe_bpsk ] , user selection will be the only focus in this section .",
    "therefore , instead of ( [ multi_obj_user_selection ] ) we solve    [ user_selection ] @xmath144    in other words , ( [ user_selection ] ) maximizes the cardinality of the set of selected users such that none of the selected users experience error floors and the transmit power constraint is met , i.e. , the number of selected users is maximized subject to the constraint set of the mpe precoding problem .",
    "this means that we try to find the maximum number of users such that the feasible region of the mpe precoding problem is not an empty set .",
    "this combinatorial optimization problem has very high computational complexity .",
    "therefore , we try to find a suboptimal algorithm for finding a _ good _ set of selected users .    for a tractable solution , we are interested in user selection as a separate entity from precoding . therefore , we try to remove the dependence of the optimization problem ( [ user_selection ] ) from the transmit precoding and receive filtering weights . but before doing this , we first simplify the problem by finding a lower bound for the left side of the inequality of the constraint ( [ user_selection_third_const ] ) as @xmath145 this lower bound is obtained by using the fact @xmath146 and @xmath147 . since this lower bound is independent of @xmath148 , all @xmath149 constraints for a fixed @xmath5 in ( [ user_selection_third_const ] ) are replaced with the single constraint : @xmath150 replacing ( [ user_selection_third_const ] ) with ( [ mod_constraint ] ) reduces the number of constraints in the optimization problem ( [ user_selection ] ) .",
