    "as in our earlier study ,  @xcite the decoherence problem can be cast in the form of the validity of a markovian approximation on the bath averaged memory kernel for the evolution of the diagonal elements of the density or operators .",
    "the simulations on a simple reaction model with quantum initial sampling allowed us to assess the validity of simple surface - hopping dynamics and how it relates to decoherence .",
    "since the reaction coordinate is treated quantum mechanically , the reactive flux correlation function starts from zero and finally reaches a plateau value from which the rate constant can be determined . in spite of the fact that this build - up typically occurs on a similar time scale to the decoherence time ,",
    "the initial structure of the correlation function is well described by master equation dynamics .",
    "the role of quantum dispersion on decoherence was also investigated .",
    "depending on system parameters , averages over the quantum dispersion around fixed bath phase space coordinates may be insufficient to provide a justification for a markovian approximation to the memory kernel .",
    "furthermore , simulations on the reaction model indicated that the quantum dispersion average of the memory kernel is a strong function of the bath coordinates and , thus , so are the transition probabilities in the master equation .",
    "an aim of this investigation was to examine the conditions under which simple surface - hopping descriptions of the dynamics , where the system evolves on single adiabatic surfaces interrupted by quantum transitions between such surfaces , are valid .",
    "an average of the memory kernel over some distribution that results in decay on a time scale faster than the decay of the correlation function of interest is required in order for a markovian master equation description of the dynamics to be valid .",
    "the decoherence of the subsystem must occur on a time scale that is shorter than that of slow subsystem processes .",
    "when these conditions are satisfied , the resulting dynamics provides a useful tool to compute expectation values since it is more stable with smaller statistical uncertainties .",
    "the results of this work should prove to be useful for understanding the dynamics of many body quantum systems more complex than those considered for our model calculations .",
    "this work was supported in part by a grant from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ."

    "<S> in open quantum systems decoherence occurs through interaction of a quantum subsystem with its environment . </S>",
    "<S> the computation of expectation values requires a knowledge of the quantum dynamics of operators and sampling from initial states of the density matrix describing the subsystem and bath . </S>",
    "<S> we consider situations where the quantum evolution can be approximated by quantum - classical liouville dynamics and examine the circumstances under which the evolution can be reduced to surface - hopping dynamics , where the evolution consists of trajectory segments evolving exclusively on single adiabatic surfaces , with probabilistic hops between these surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the justification for the reduction depends on the validity of a markovian approximation on a bath averaged memory kernel that accounts for quantum coherence in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that such a reduction is often possible when initial sampling is from either the quantum or classical bath initial distributions . if the average is taken only over the quantum dispersion that broadens the classical distribution , then such a reduction is not always possible . </S>"
