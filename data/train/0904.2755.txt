    "the swift midex explorer mission@xcite , comprised of the wide - field ( @xmath0 sr , half - coded ) hard x - ray ( 15 - 150 kev ) burst alert telescope ( bat ) , and the narrow - field ( 0.2 - 10 kev ) x - ray ( xrt ) and ( 170 - 600 nm ) ultraviolet - optical ( uvot ) telescopes , has revolutionized our understanding of grbs .",
    "the intrinsic multi - wavelength instrumentation , coupled with a rapid ( @xmath1 100 seconds ) autonomous slew capability , has ushered in an unprecedented era of source localization precision @xmath2 that is disseminated in real - time ( @xmath3 seconds ) via the grb coordinate network ( gcn)@xcite , thus spear - heading international ground - based and satellite multi - wavelength follow - up campaigns .",
    "swift s unique dynamic response and spatial localization precision , in conjunction with the aforementioned correlative ground - based follow - up efforts , have resulted in redshift determinations for @xmath4 grbs , including the most distant cosmological explosion , grb 080913 at @xmath5@xcite , which has begun to constrain progenitor models@xcite .",
    "selection effects , such as detector composition and long accumulation timescales , bias bat towards long , soft grbs with lower characteristic photon energy @xmath6 . consequently",
    ", bat grbs comprise a separate statistical class , as is demonstrated by their fluence and redshift distributions @xmath7 , from classical burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) grbs .",
    "high - z grbs afford an unprecedented opportunity to probe the earliest epoch of stellar formation via the detection of population i , ii ( normal ) and iii ( massive ) stars .",
    "meanwhile , the association of grb 050509b with an elliptical host galaxy@xcite supports the idea that short grbs may arise from compact binary mergers such as the coalescence of neutron stars ( @xmath0 m@xmath8 ) with other neutron stars ( dns ) or black holes ( bh - ns / bh - bh)@xcite . with an estimated orbital lifetime of @xmath9 years",
    ", it is anticipated that swift will continue to operate until @xmath10 .",
    "fermi , which is comprised of the ( @xmath1120 mev to @xmath12300 gev ) large area telescope ( lat ) and the ( 10 kev - 30 mev ) gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) , launched on june 11 , 2008 and has an anticipated mission lifetime of @xmath13 years , taking it into @xmath14 .",
    "fermi has already made some remarkable detections@xcite including the first gev emission from a short burst ( grb 081024b ) as well as the burst with the most isotropic energy release ( grb 080916c ) .",
    "the gbm , consisting of 12 nai ( 10 - 1000 kev ) and 2 bgo ( 0.15 - 25 mev ) detectors , monitors @xmath15 steradians of the sky , and , in concert with lat , enables fermi to continuously span 7 energy decades , but not at the same sensitivity .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ overlapped_effective_areas ] , fermi s effective area drops by over @xmath16 orders of magnitude from lat ( gev ) to gbm - nai ( kev ) energies , while the ( masked ) bat ( @xmath1720 - 100 kev ) low energy effective area surpasses gbm - nai s by over a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , although swift has detected @xmath19 grbs , the majority of @xmath20 kev values lie beyond bat s canonical energy range .",
    "thus , correlated observations would simultaneously augment fermi - gbm s low energy response while increasing the number of @xmath21 for swift - bat grbs .",
    "additionally , since swift s high fidelity localization precision surpasses gbm s by over @xmath22 orders of magnitude , bat will facilitate grb follow - up campaigns for fermi bursts . in this manner",
    ", we expect that @xmath23 of bursts within joint bat - gbm analyses will be accompanied by panchromatic ground - based follow - up observations resulting in spectroscopic redshift determinations and host galaxy identifications .",
    "if a lat grb triggers swift , chances favor subsequent detections by it s nfi s , since @xmath24 of bat grbs",
    "are observed with xrt ( @xmath25 ksec ) and @xmath26 have accompanied optical measurements from a combination of uvot and ground - based observations .",
    "hence , fermi and swift are poised to simultaneously span eleven decades in spectral energy ( see figure  [ overlapped_effective_areas ] ) , and have already commenced correlated grb observations for @xmath27 grbs .",
    "it is anticipated that such joint studies will be possible a few times per month for an annual rate of @xmath28 grbs@xcite .",
    "thus far , a canonical phenomenological description , known as the fireball model@xcite , has successfully described most prompt and afterglow grb electromagnetic observations . however , despite great strides made by satellite - and ground - based electromagnetic observations , the details of grb progenitor(s ) remain concealed .",
    "this physical limitation is due to the initial optical thickness of the fireball , prior to adiabatic relativistic expansion , which precludes us from witnessing the genesis of a grb .",
    "the relativistic nature of grbs , inferred by the necessity for the expanding fireball shell to be optically thin , requires bulk lorentz boost factors in the range @xmath29 , with typical values of @xmath30 for isotropic emission geometry . _",
    "since we are fundamentally limited by the optical opacity of the source at the early stages of its inception , perhaps the next evolution in our understanding of the microphysics of the central engine will be realized via the detection of non - electromagnetic emission . _",
    "the observed isotropic and cosmological spatial distribution of grbs , coupled with the fact that the energy injection rates of ultra high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) and grbs are similar , resulted in the phenomenological suggestion that grbs may be the sources of uhecrs@xcite .",
    "canonical fireball phenomenology , in the context of hadronic ( fermi ) acceleration within the astrophysical jet , predicts a taxonomy of correlated mev to eev neutrinos from grbs of varying flavor and arrival times .",
    "ideal for detection are @xmath17 tev - pev muon neutrinos@xcite , which arise as the leptonic decay products of photomeson interactions ( @xmath31 \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}+\\nu_{\\mu } \\rightarrow e^{+ } + \\nu_e + $ ] @xmath32 ) , within the internal shocks of the relativistic fireball . since the prompt @xmath33-rays act as the ambient photon target field , these neutrinos are expected to be in spatial and temporal coincidence , which imposes a constraint that is tantamount to nearly background - free searches@xcite in telescopes such as icecube@xcite .",
    "grbs are beacons for multi - messenger astronomy@xcite that serve as astrophysical laboratories for special / general relativity , particle astrophysics and cosmology . in the electromagnetic regime ,",
    "swift s dynamic response and localization precision will complement prompt emission from fermi , while facilitating ground - based follow - up via the gcn .",
    "such unprecedented broad - band electromagnetic capability will enable joint grb data sets that will enhance our understanding of burst parameter classifications , enable routine determinations of e@xmath34 values , explore grb emission geometry , and help test the viability of various redshift estimation methods@xcite .",
    "in addition , a more accurate normalization between prompt and afterglow emissions will facilitate the determination of grb energy budgets , while enabling investigations of spectral and temporal evolution@xcite over unprecedented decades of energy .",
    "the detection of non - electromagnetic emission from grbs , via high - energy neutrinos with icecube , has the potential for broad scientific breakthroughs .",
    "a positive detection of high - energy neutrinos would confirm hadronic acceleration in the relativistic grb - wind providing critical insight to the associated micro - physics of the fireball while revealing an astrophysical acceleration mechanism for uhecrs , thus resolving a century old enigma .",
    "given such tremendous discovery potential for science synergy and impact , our view of the cosmos is bound to change forever .",
