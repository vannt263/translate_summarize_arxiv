    "generally speaking , a switched system is a dynamical system that consists of a finite number of subsystems and a switching signal .",
    "the subsystems are described by differential equations and are employed to capture the dominant dynamics of the system in different operation modes .",
    "the switching signal decides which subsystem is being activated ( equivalently , which operation mode the system is working in ) at a particular time .",
    "the study on switched systems has attracted a lot of research attention @xcite .",
    "switched systems have various applications such as in communication networks @xcite , aerospace industry @xcite and networked control systems @xcite .",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite for a general introduction and @xcite for a recent review .",
    "a special class of switched systems with a random switching signal is markovian jump systems where the switching signal is modeled by a markov process @xcite .",
    "the sliding mode control of markovian jump systems has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the filtering problem has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "some results of markovian jump systems with time delays have been reported in @xcite .",
    "when there are switching probability uncertainties , the stochastic stability problems have been studied in @xcite recently .    in this paper , a new class of random switching signals",
    "is proposed to activate the subsystems of switched systems , and a necessary and sufficient condition is established for the stochastic stability analysis . for switched systems with the switching signal proposed in this paper , the dwell time in each subsystem consists of two parts : the fixed dwell time and the random dwell time .",
    "the fixed dwell time plays a similar role as the `` dwell time '' in deterministic switched systems  @xcite ; the random dwell time is corresponding to the exponentially distributed `` sojourn time '' in markovian jump systems  @xcite .",
    "with the proposed class of random switching signals , the switched system can be transformed to a markovian jump system with state jumps at the switching time instants .",
    "the stochastic stability problem is then studied using a lyapunov approach ; and a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained . when the parameters of the random switching signal are known , the system stability can be checked by solving a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities .",
    "a numerical example is used to illustrate the effect of the random switching signals on system stability .",
    "the stability regions and instability regions are numerically determined for different values of the fixed dwell time parameters .",
    "the numerical results demonstrate that ( 1 ) when all the subsystems are stable , fast switching may destabilize the system , and hence it should be avoided ; ( 2 ) when both stable and unstable subsystems are present , dwelling in the stable subsystems longer can increase the degree of the stability , otherwise the system will tend to become unstable ; ( 3 ) when all the subsystems are unstable , both fast and slow switching can destabilize the system , the system stability , however , may sometimes be achieved by choosing the fixed dwell time parameters properly .",
    "compared to the previous work in @xcite , the work in this paper provides a new and more general view of switching , and the corresponding stability results .",
    "the class of random switching signals in this paper allows that a fixed dwell time can exist for each mode before a markov switch occurs .",
    "hence , the systems in this paper can possibly accommodate more realistic situations ; the results in this paper should be applicable , in principle , to all previous cases . moreover , the results in this paper also lay a foundation for novel hybrid controller design , which is illustrated by the numerical example in section  [ sec : illustr - exampl ] .    _",
