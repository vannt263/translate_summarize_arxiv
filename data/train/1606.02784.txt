    "the rare isotope science project ( risp ) was established in december 2011 to construct raon ( rare isotope accelerator of newness ) accelerator for various science programs .",
    "the project of the raon accelerator  @xcite is in progress in order to generate and accelerate a variety of stable heavy ion beams and rare isotope beams to be used for a wide range of basic science researches and various applications . to produce various rare isotope beams , the raon accelerator put to use the in - flight fragmentation ( if ) system and the isotope separation on - line ( isol ) system . at first , the if system uses a diver linac , which consists of a 28 ghz superconducting electron cyclotron resonance ion source ( ecr - is ) , a main low energy beam transport ( lebt ) section  @xcite , a radio - frequency quadrupole ( rfq ) accelerator , a medium energy beam transport ( mebt ) section , a low energy superconducting linac ( scl1 ) , a charge stripper section ( css ) , and a high energy superconducting linac ( scl2 ) .",
    "the beams accelerated by the scl2 collide with the if target , and then the rare isotope beams are created from the collision .",
    "secondly , the isol system uses a 70 mev cyclotron as the driver to deliver a 70 kw beam power up to the isol target .",
    "the rare isotope beams created by the isol system are accelerated again by a post accelerator , which consists of a post lebt  @xcite , a post rfq , a post mebt , and a low energy superconducting linac scl3 .",
    "the beams accelerated by the scl3 will be delivered up to the low energy experimental hall or to scl2 after passing through the the post accelerator to the driver linac transport ( p2dt ) section  @xcite . a schematic layout of raon accelerator is shown in fig .  [ raon ] .",
    "as above mentioned , the post accelerator consists of four sections ; the post lebt , the post rfq , the post mebt , and the scl3 .",
    "first of all , the lattice of the post lebt was partly modified because that of the isol system was recently changed .",
    "the new lattice design and beam dynamics simulations of the post lebt were presented in  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the post lebt is the stable transportation of the heavy ion beams and rare isotope beams up to the post rfq . to accomplish this goal ,",
    "the electro - static quadrupoles are used in the post lebt . secondly , the post rfq of the post accelerator and the rfq of the driver linac are the same , which is about 5 m long and the number of cell is 245 .",
    "the maximum peak surface electric field is 17 mv / m and thus the post rfq can accelerate 10 kev / u beam to 500 kev / u .",
    "thirdly , the post mebt includes 8 quadrupoles and 3 buncher cavities , which are used to satisfy the beam requirements of the scl3 .",
    "finally , the scl3 is divided into three sections , scl31 , scl32 and scl33 , depending on the cavity type and the number of cavities in one cryomodule .",
    "the first section , the scl31 is composed of 22 quarter - wave resonator ( qwr ) type cavities and each cavity is surrounded by one cryomodule .",
    "the second section , the scl32 has 26 half - wave resonator ( hwr ) type cavities and one cryomodule surrounds two cavities .",
    "third , the scl33 has 76 hwr type cavities and one cryomodule surrounds 4 cavities .",
    "the schematic layout of the post accelerator is shown in figure  [ post_accelerator ] .    in this paper",
    ", we will present the results of the start - to - end simulations for the post accelerator with the reference beam @xmath0sn@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the study of the error analysis and correction at the superconducting linac scl3 will be described by using the graphical user interface ( gui ) based on the matlab program and the dynac  @xcite code in raon accelerator  @xcite .",
    ".initial beam information . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]     [ error_300 ]    for the orbit correction in raon accelerator , the gui based on the matlab program and the dynac code has been developed .",
    "figure  [ gui_orbitcor ] shows the gui screen after the orbit correction with quadrupole misalignment 300 @xmath2 m and 200 random seeds .",
    "as listed in table  [ error_300 ] , the horizontal ( vertical ) rms beam size decreases from 48.9 ( 36.3 ) @xmath2 m to 2.9 ( 2.1 ) @xmath2 m after the orbit correction . the average corrector strength is less than the mechanical maximum value .",
    "figure  [ xy_orbitcor ] shows the rms orbit size at the bpms before and after the orbit correction for 100500 @xmath2 m rms quadrupole misalignment with 200 random seeds . for the quadrupole rms misalignment from 100 @xmath2 m 500 @xmath2 m",
    ", the rms orbit size decreases about -90 % . the maximum and average corrector strength for the orbit correction",
    "is shown in figure  [ corr_orbitcor ] .",
    "for some random seeds , the corrector kick angle becomes larger , but the average value is less than 0.6 mrad which is much less than the mechanical maximum kick angle , about 2.7 mrad",
    ". the research for the proper number and position of the correctors and bpms will be continued .",
    "we presented the results of the start - to - end simulations with the rare isotope beam in the post accelerator of the raon accelerator . for the post accelerator ,",
    "the new reference beam , @xmath0sn@xmath1 , from the isol system was tracked from the post lebt to the superconducting linac scl3 . at the end of the scl3",
    ", the beam energy reached at about 27.7 mev / u and the rms beam size along the post accelerator was kept much less than the beam pipe radii . the error analysis and correction",
    "were also performed at the scl3 .",
    "the tolerance of each error source was calculated and the beam orbit distorted by the errors was corrected with the svd method . additionally , for various error sources , the orbit distortion was checked and corrected with the correctors and bpms . as a result , the average kick angle of correctors for the orbit correction was much less than the mechanical maximum value .",
    "the research for the proper number and position of the correctors and bpms will be carried out continuously .",
    "this work was supported by the rare isotope science project of institute for basic science funded by ministry of science , ict and future planning and national research foundation of korea ( 2013m7a1a1075764 ) .",
