    "the first brilliant insight for unifying the einsteins theory of gravitation and maxwells theory of electromagnetism was proposed by kaluza and klein by considering a pure gravitational theory in a five - dimensional manifold @xcite .",
    "the kaluza - klein theory of gravity and electromagnetism has been the starting point for the development of higher dimensional theories of gravity including the superstring and the m - theory @xcite .",

    "wormholes are strongly gravitating objects connecting remote parts of the universe or one distant region of spacetime to another@xcite , @xcite .",
    "they are studied for several purposes such as describing physics as pure geometry and as a model for a charged particle represented by a bridge connecting two asymptotically minkowskian manifolds called einstein - rosen bridge @xcite .",
    "the general theory of a traversable lorentzian wormhole was formulated by morris and thorne @xcite .",
    "wormholes suggested by morris and thorne are spherically symmetric with a smooth surface throat @xcite .",
    "they also showed that this kind of wormhole not only might allow humans to travel among universes , but also to build time machines @xcite .",
    "another application of wormholes is in the development of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "static lorentzian wormholes in four - dimensional einstein gravity can exist only in the presence of exotic matter which violates the null energy conditions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this is a challenging feature in wormhole physics , which is named as the exotic matter problem .",
    "attempts for solving this issue includes alternative theories of gravity @xcite-@xcite , using quantum effects in curved spacetimes and regarding wormholes as semi classical objects @xcite .",
    "another approach for solving this problem is to consider wormholes in higher dimensional theories of gravity , in which exotic matter is not obligatory @xcite .",
    "the first kaluza - klein wormhole was discovered by chodos and detweiler @xcite .",
    "the authors obtained a class of spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat solutions describing wormholes .",
