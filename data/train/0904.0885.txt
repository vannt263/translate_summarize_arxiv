    "in 1934 , frenzel and schultes @xcite accidentally discovered a phenomenon that later became known as _ multi - bubble sonoluminescence _ @xcite . in order to speed up the development process of pictures , they applied ultrasonic waves to a tank with a photographic fluid .",
    "what they observed were tiny imploding bubbles emitting light at low intensity .",
    "interest in this phenomenon increased again in 1989 , when gaitan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were able to produce the cavitation of a single bubble .",
    "optimising the experimental setup , they created a stable bubble whose radius changed periodically in time . in each cycle , the bubble suddenly collapses and emits a sharp light pulse . in its new form , the phenomenon became known as _ single - bubble sonoluminescence_. later , the groups of putterman @xcite , suslick @xcite and others @xcite perfected these experiments .",
    "luminescence of a cavitating bubble has even been induced by pulsed laser excitation @xcite .",
    "marks the beginning of the collapse phase in which the bubble approaches its minimum radius very rapidly and becomes thermally isolated from the liquid . in point",
    "@xmath0 , the temperature within the bubble is significantly increased and a strong light flash occurs .",
    "point @xmath1 denotes the beginning of the expansion phase in which the bubble oscillates around its equilibrium radius until it regains its stability.,title=\"fig : \" ]    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a typical single - bubble sonoluminescence cycle and indicates the relevant time scales @xcite .",
    "the period of the applied sound wave is around @xmath2s .",
    "the time dependence of the bubble radius is in good agreement with the laws of classical physics and can be described by the rayleigh - plesset equations @xcite . for most of the cycle ,",
    "the bubble radius increases isothermal . each expansion phase",
    "is followed by a rapid collapse phase .",
    "close to point @xmath3 , i.e.  about @xmath4ns before the minimum radius is reached , the accelerating bubble wall becomes so fast that the bubble becomes thermally isolated from the liquid .",
    "close to its minimum radius of about @xmath5 m , i.e.  between points @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the bubble might be filled with up to @xmath6 noble gas atoms . at this point ,",
    "a rapid increase of the energy density occurs which is accompanied by the sudden emission of light . in case of argon atoms ,",
    "the light flash lasts for about @xmath7ps .",
    "afterwards a re - expansion phase begins in which the bubble oscillates around its equilibrium radius until it regains its stability .",

    "[ fig1 ] have been made . associating the continuum underlying these sonoluminescence spectra with blackbody or _",
    "radiation indicates temperatures of at least @xmath8@xmath9k inside the bubble @xcite .",
    "it is even possible to observe light emission in the ultraviolet regime which hints at temperatures of about @xmath10k @xcite .",
    "noteworthy is the discovery of sharp emission lines in the optical regime @xcite .",
    "these indicate the population of highly excited energy eigenstates of noble gas @xcite and metal atoms @xcite which can not be populated thermally .",
    "these excitations prove the formation of an opaque plasma core inside the bubble and have been observed in several single- and in multi - bubble sonoluminescence experiments @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite already verified the existence of a dense plasma inside the bubble .",
    "the light flash at the end of the bubble collapse phase has been attributed to surface blackbody radiation @xcite , neutral and ion bremsstrahlung @xcite , collision - induced emission @xcite , quantum vacuum radiation @xcite , and other thermal @xcite and non - thermal processes @xcite .",
    "other authors describe the plasma temperatures inside the bubble by a converging spherical shock wave @xcite .",
    "all of these models reproduce the observed single - bubble sonoluminescence spectra qualitatively .",
    "nevertheless , the origin of the sudden energy concentration during the final stage of the bubble collapse phase in single - bubble sonoluminescence experiments remains a mystery @xcite .",
    "a valid theoretical model needs to include a mechanism for the formation of a plasma , as well as a mechanism which can increase the temperature of the plasma even further by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "this mechanism needs to be able to operate in a solid state - like environment and on the very small length scale given by the radius of the bubble .    in this paper",
    "we show that a relatively weak but highly inhomogeneous electric field can cause a coupling between the quantised motion and the electronic states of strongly confined particles . when combined with spontaneous emission ,",
    "this coupling results in very high heating rates .",
    "the origin of this heating lies in the fact that the creation of a phonon is more likely than the annihilation of a phonon .",
    "this transfers the particles to higher and higher temperatures .",
    "we then point out that the electric field required for this process might occur naturally in sonoluminescence experiments during rapid bubble deformations .",
    "moreover , the noble gas atoms inside the bubble form a van der waals gas which reaches its van der waals core when the bubble approaches its minimum radius @xcite .",
    "they hence experience strong trapping potentials such that their motion becomes quantised .",
    "furthermore we remark that noble gas atoms have a stable enough level configuration to undergo a strong heating process .",
    "the quantum optical heating of nobel gas atoms might therefore play a crucial role in single and multibubble sonoluminescence experiments .",
    "our model does not contradict current models for the description of sonoluminescence experiments but might explain certain controversial aspects of this phenomenon .",
    "in addition to pointing out a previously unconsidered heating mechanism , it clarifies the role of the noble gas atoms .",
    "indeed , sonoluminescence experiments require a relatively high concentration of them inside the bubble @xcite .",
    "moreover , our calculations show that the inhomogeneous electric field accompanying the heating process would result in a non - negligible population of excited atomic states and the non - thermal emission of light in the optical regime .",
    "the detection of a certain background radiation prior to the light flash during the bubble collapse phase would hence be a first indirect proof of our model .",
    "this radiation is expected to occur on a nanosecond time scale and should result in sharp emission lines at a typical noble gas transition .",
    "its intensity should be proportional to the phonon frequency @xmath11 and to the number of emitting atoms but does not depend on their temperature .",
    "the model we use for the description of the proposed quantum optical heating mechanism is similar to the models typically used to describe laser sideband cooling in ion trap experiments @xcite . in these experiments a _ red_-detuned laser field",
    "is applied . like the above mentioned highly inhomogeneous electric field , it establishes a coupling between the quantised motion and the electronic states of trapped atoms .",
    "based on this analogy , we conclude this paper with the proposal to enhance the energy concentration in sonoluminescence experiments with the help of appropriately _",
    "blue_-detuned laser fields .",
    "the observation of a certain dependence of the sonoluminescence phenomenon on the frequency ( and lesser on the intensity ) of the applied laser field would support our thesis of quantum optical heating . increasing the temperatures inside the bubble via laser driving",
    "could assist sonochemistry in the synthesis of a wide range of nanostructured materials and in the preparation of biomaterials @xcite and might even help to facilitate nuclear fusion @xcite .",
    "there are seven sections in this paper . in section [ perspective ]",
    ", we explain the basic idea behind the considered quantum optical heating mechanism .",
    "a theoretical description of strongly confined atoms inside a highly inhomogeneous electric field is given in section [ dynamics ] . in section [ hotter ]",
    "we solve the time evolution of a single atom which is typical for all the atoms inside the bubble . in section [ b ]",
    "we discuss the emission of a certain background radiation in the optical regime which accompanies the heating process prior to the light flash .",
    "section [ poss ] concludes our discussion by pointing out a mechanism to further increase the temperature inside the bubble .",
    "we finally summarise our results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper , we describe a quantum optical heating mechanism which occurs when a weak but highly inhomogeneous electric field interacts with strongly confined noble gas atoms .",
    "such a field might occur naturally during the sudden contractions of the bubble radius in single - bubble sonoluminescence experiments and during rapid bubble movements and deformations in multi - bubble sonoluminescence experiments .",
    "polar molecules of the liquid dissolve and ionized species might be trapped inside the bubble @xcite , thereby leading to a non - negligible inhomogeneous charge distribution .",
    "this charge distribution is further enhanced by the formation of a plasma which might create a significant excess of charge density @xcite .",
    "although , the electric field gradient inside the bubble might be negligible for most of the time , it might become very high on the relevant @xmath12 m length scale which is given by the bubble radius , when the bubble approaches its light emission stage .    when the bubble reaches its minimum radius ( cf .",
    "point @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in single - bubble sonoluminescence experiments ) , the mean distance between the noble gas atoms becomes so small that interactions between them can be described by a lennard - jones potential .",
    "the atoms experience an equilibrium between repulsive interatomic forces due to overlapping orbitals ( also referred to as pauli repulsion ) and attractive forces . to model the resulting strong confinement of the atoms inside the bubble , we place each of them into a trapping potential .",
    "this allows us to quantise the atom motion during the collapse phase when the bubble reaches its maximum compression . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the assumption of only one phonon mode per atom and denote its frequency by @xmath11 .",
    "we expect that the nobel gas atoms have a stable enough level configuration to undergo strong heating processes .    in the next section",
    ", we shall see that the gradient of the electric field inside the bubble establishes a coupling between the quantised motion and the electronic states of each noble gas atom . to model this",
    "we denote the ground state of each noble gas atom by @xmath13 while @xmath14 is an excited electronic state .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian contains terms that correspond to the excitation and to the de - excitation of atoms accompanied by the creation and the annihilation of a phonon .",
    "crucial for changing the temperature of the atoms is the presence of a large spontaneous decay rate of the excited state @xmath15 which keeps the atoms predominantly in their ground state .",
    "although the described processes are highly non - resonant , we show below that they can result in a significant change of the mean phonon number per atom . within a few nanoseconds , the temperature inside the bubble can increase by many orders of magnitude .     and possesses exactly @xmath16 phonons . as in eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) , @xmath17 denotes the coupling constant for phonon conserving transitions to the excited atomic state @xmath14 , while @xmath18 is due to the electric field gradient inside the bubble and establishes a coupling between the electronic and the motional states of the atom .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 is the spontaneous photon decay rate of level 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    before going into a more detailed analysis , let us describe the proposed heating mechanism in a more intuitive way .",
    "suppose an atom is initially in its ground state and possesses exactly @xmath16 phonons .",
    "we denote this state by @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the immediately relevant transitions for this state which we derive explicitly in the next section ( cf .",
    "( [ hint ] ) and ( [ master2 ] ) ) .",
    "notice that phonons are bosons with their annihilation and creation operator @xmath21 and @xmath22 given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 = 1 $ ] .",
    "consequently , a transition from the state @xmath20 into @xmath25 occurs with a rate proportional to @xmath26 , while the rate for a transition from @xmath20 into @xmath27 scales as @xmath28 .",
    "when the spontaneous decay rate of the atom is relatively large , such a transition is most likely followed by an irreversible and predominantly non - radiative transition back into the ground state of the atom .",
    "it transfers the atom either into its initial state @xmath20 , into @xmath29 , or into @xmath30 .",
    "since the final population in the state with @xmath31 phonons is higher than the population in the state with @xmath32 phonons , the net effect of the described excitation and de - excitation process is an increase of the mean phonon number per atom , i.e.  heating .",
    "let us now have a closer look at the mechanism which creates the coupling between the quantised motion and the electronic states of the nobel gas atom shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . to do",
    "so we assume the presence of a weak but highly inhomogeneous electric field and derive effective rate equations for the time evolution of a _ single _ atom - phonon system which is typical for the many atoms inside the bubble . for simplicity ,",
    "we approximate each atom by a two - level system .",
    "suppose @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the position of a single atom inside the bubble . within the usual dipole approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the atom is given by the dipole interaction @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the charge of a single electron , the ( real ) atomic dipole moment @xmath38 and the electric field @xmath39 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that all field components point in the same direction of a unit vector @xmath40 , which allows us to write @xmath39 as @xmath41 with amplitudes @xmath42 and wave vectors @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , we consider the motion of the atom as quantised . for simplicity ,",
    "we describe its motion in the @xmath40-direction by only a single phonon mode with frequency @xmath44 and the annihilation operator @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) . replacing the position operator @xmath45 accordingly ,",
    "we find @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the current equilibrium position of the atom , @xmath48 is its mass , and @xmath49 would be the width of its ground state wave function when replacing the square - well like potential seen by each atom by a harmonic one",
    ". an accurate description of the motion of the atom would involve a continuous range of phonon frequencies .",
    "here @xmath44 is the dominating frequency of the populated phonon modes .",
    "this approximation is similar to the approximation made when describing the light emission from a blackbody by a single frequency in order to attribute a temperature @xmath50 .",
    "( [ shrink3 ] ) can be used to get a _ very rough _ estimate of the typical phonon frequency @xmath11 in sonoluminescence experiments .",
    "suppose , the bubble has a radius of @xmath51 nm and is filled with about @xmath52 argon atoms .",
    "although this might vary by at least one order of magnitude , we assume that the volume of each atom is given by @xmath53 . comparing this volume with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the volume of the bubble",

    "since the atom is well localized within the wavelength of its trapping potential , i.e.  @xmath59 , we can now apply the lamb - dicke approximation which is routinely used in the theoretical modelling of ion trap experiments .",

    "we see an approximately exponential growth of @xmath196 as a function of time .",

    "[ fig2 ] for example by the spin quantum number .",
    "eventually , this results in a complete depletion of the electronic states @xmath13 and @xmath14 . then the coherences in eq .",
    "( [ coh ] ) become zero , thereby ending the heating process and the emission of light from the corresponding nobel gas transition .",
    "notice that the light emission described in this subsection is not a description of the strong light flash at the end of the bubble collapse phase .",
    "this light flash and its spectrum are dominated by thermal radiation which can be attributed to very high temperatures inside the bubble .",
    "here we are interested in a mechanism which might contribute substantially to the creation of these very high temperatures .",
    "the photons which we describe in this section accompany the proposed quantum optical mechanism as background radiation .",
    "their detection would constitute a first indirect proof of our model .",
    "the background photons should be present prior to the light flash during the bubble collapse phase . they are expected to occur on a nanosecond time scale , are highly non - thermal , and should result in sharp emission lines at a frequency which is typical for the noble gas atoms inside the bubble .    for the experimental parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] one can easily estimate that a single atom inside the bubble emits between @xmath204 and @xmath205 photons per nanosecond .",
    "this means , a single atom emits on average between @xmath204 and @xmath205 photons prior to the picosecond light flash which ends the bubble collapse phase .",
    "the intensity of the emitted background photons depends strongly on the total number of atoms @xmath197 involved in the heating mechanism .",
    "although we expect this contribution to remain small compared to the @xmath206@xmath52 photons emitted in the optical regime during the picosecond light flash @xcite , it should be feasible to detect them .",
    "one way to enhance the energy concentration in sonoluminescence experiments is to create an auxiliary highly inhomogeneous electric field inside the bubble thereby increasing the coupling between the quantised motion and the electronic states of the atoms .",
    "however , the atoms experience a very strong trapping potential , especially during the collapse phase in single - bubble sonoluminescence experiments , as one can see for example from the robustness of the spherical symmetry of the bubble during each cycle @xcite .",
    "an analogy between ion trap and sonoluminescence experiments therefore suggests another , potentially more efficient approach : namely the application of a blue - detuned laser field which should excite the 01 transition of the noble gas atoms ( or of another atomic species with sharp optical transition lines which have already been observed experimentally @xcite ) inside the bubble .    in ion trap experiments ,",
    "an ion experiences a strong trapping potential such that its motion becomes quantised @xcite .",
    "moreover , a laser field is applied and creates a coupling between the quantised motion and the electronic states of the ion . in case of a red - detuned laser ,",
    "transitions where the ion becomes excited and loses a phonon are far more likely than transitions where the atom becomes excited and gains a phonon . followed by the return of the ion to its ground state via the spontaneous emission of a photon ,",
    "the overall effect is a permanent reduction of the mean phonon number in the ions motion , i.e.  cooling .    , possesses exactly @xmath16 phonons and a laser field excites the blue sideband resonantly.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the similarity of the level scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and the atomic level configuration in ion trap experiments @xcite suggests that a laser field applied to the nobel gas atoms trapped inside the bubble in sonoluminescence experiments either enhances or suppresses the heating process , thereby testing our hypothesis of the presence of tightly trapped atoms during the bubble collapse phase .",
    "a maximum enhancement of the heating process should occur when the laser frequency equals the sum of the transition frequency @xmath76 and the phonon frequency @xmath11 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . in this case ,",
    "transitions between @xmath207 and @xmath208 are resonantly driven while transitions between @xmath20 and @xmath209 are highly detuned .",
    "additional laser fields should be used to avoid the premature depletion of @xmath13 and @xmath14 due to the spontaneous emission of photons into states outside the relevant two - level system .    of course , sonoluminescence experiments are very different from ion trap experiments .",
    "there are for example extreme differences in the temperature and in the time - dependence of the trapping potential observed by each atom in its finite size environment .",
    "ion trap experiments take place in a far more controlled environment than sonoluminescence experiments , i.e.  at temperatures close to absolute zero .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that a laser is capable of driving the transitions in the atom - phonon systems shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "possible transitions , which can be used for this purpose , are indicated by the emission of light prior to the light flash at certain optical frequencies , as discussed in section [ b ] .",
    "we expect that the sonoluminescence phenomenon depends not only on the intensity of an applied laser field but also shows a very strong dependence on the laser frequency .",
    "in this paper we discuss a quantum optical heating mechanism which might contribute substantially to the sudden energy concentration in sonoluminescence experiments .",
    "our model is based on two assumptions .",
    "first , we assume a very strong confinement of the noble gas atoms inside the bubble during the light emission phase such that their motion becomes quantised just before the maximum compression of the bubble in single - bubble sonoluminescence experiments and during rapid bubble deformations in multi - bubble sonoluminescence experiments .",
    "secondly , our model requires the presence of a weak but highly inhomogeneous electric field .",
    "the electric field establishes a strong coupling between the quantised motion and the electronic states of each atom .",
    "heating is due to the fact that processes which create a phonon are more likely than processes which annihilate a phonon .",
    "our model does not contradict current models for the description of sonoluminescence experiments , but explains certain controversial aspects of this phenomenon .",
    "we show that the phonon energy in the bubble can easily increase by a factor of ten or more ( cf .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ) .",
    "the relation @xmath210 can be used to estimate the corresponding temperature increase .",
    "in fact , our model can easily predict temperatures well above @xmath211k inside the bubble .",
    "rapid changes of the system parameters might further enhance the proposed quantum optical heating process .",
    "moreover , our calculations emphasize the role of the noble gas atoms inside the bubbles .",
    "although predominantly in their ground state , they act like catalysers and facilitate the creation of phonons at a very high rate .",
    "our model is based on a quantum optical approach which is routinely used to describe the laser cooling of tightly trapped ions . to test our hypothesis of a strongly confined noble gas atoms inside the bubble during the bubble collapse phase",
    ", we propose to manipulate them with the help of an external laser field .",
    "such a laser would create a coupling between the quantised motion and the electronic states of the atoms similar to the coupling created by a weak but highly inhomogeneous electric field . depending on its laser frequency with respect to the relevant noble gas transition ( or with respect to a sharp optical transition of another atomic species @xcite ) , it is therefore expected to either enhance or inhibit the sonoluminescence phenomenon .",
    "the possibility to increase the temperature inside the bubble in typical sonoluminescence experiments with the help of appropriate laser fields would be a direct proof of our model",
    ". a first indirect proof could be the observation of a background radiation prior to the light flash which accompanies the proposed quantum optical heating process .",
    "its intensity should not depend on the temperature inside the bubble but is proportional to the heating rate @xmath147 , the phonon frequency @xmath11 and the number of nobel gas atoms involved in the heating process .",
    "the frequency of the emitted photons should correspond to typical nobel gas transitions in the optical regime .",
