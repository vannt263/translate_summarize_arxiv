    "in equilibrium , the occupation numbers , or more generally , the density matrix of the quantum states of an interacting electron system as a function of temperature @xmath0 , chemical potential @xmath1 or magnetic field @xmath2 , are given explicitly in terms of the statistical operator .",
    "out of equilibrium , even in a stationary situation involving e.g. a current flow through the system , the statistical operator is not known in general .",
    "statistical expectation values of observables may however be calculated for noninteracting systems , as e.g. in the landauer formula for the conductance , or else in perturbation theory in the interaction using the method of nonequilibrium green s functions  @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple example of the effect of a finite current on the occupation of a quantum state is the polarization of a spin-1/2 on a quantum dot in a magnetic field coupled by exchange interaction to the conduction electron spins in the leads . for sufficiently large chemical potential difference between source and drain electrodes , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the zeeman splitting of the local spin levels , the occupation numbers are no longer determined by the thermal boltzmann factors , but by a rate equation .",
    "more generally , it is a quantum boltzmann equation which describes the steady state of transitions between the two local zeeman levels induced by the available excess energy of electrons moving from the reservoir at higher chemical potential ( source ) to that with lower chemical potential ( drain ) .",
    "these processes are mediated by the exchange interaction and the resulting occupation numbers , or equivalently , the spin polarization , can be very different from their thermal equilibrium values , even in the limit of vanishing exchange coupling .",
    "for example , the spin susceptibility , which in equilibrium obeys the curie law @xmath5 , is found to decrease with bias voltage @xmath6 as @xmath7 at @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "refs .  ) .    in the case of a single quantum dot characterized by a spin-1/2 , the density matrix of the local spin states is diagonal and",
    "the occupation numbers may be obtained , at least in lowest order in the coupling , by solving a rate equation .",
    "this is no longer the case in more complicated situations , when the density matrix is not even approximately diagonal in the basis of eigenstates of the isolated nanostructure or quantum impurity .",
    "the quantum boltzmann equation therefore takes the form of a matrix integral - equation which can easily become numerically challenging .",
    "we show in this paper how the quantum boltzmann equation may be solved approximately in a controlled way with the aid of a non - unitary transformation of the matrix green s functions for the quantum impurity .",
    "this transformation serves to diagonalize the impurity ( matrix-)spectral - function . by subsequently neglecting the broadening of these eigenstates of the cotunnel - coupled impurity ,",
    "one again arrives at a simple rate - equation for the occupation numbers , valid to leading order in the cotunneling amplitude ( e.g.  second order in the exchange - coupling , i.e.  fourth order in the tunneling amplitudes ) .",
    "this bloch - redfield  @xcite type equation still involves off - diagonal terms , describing the transition amplitudes for the ( voltage-)driven impurity system , but it remains far simpler than the full quantum boltzmann equation and is readily solved numerically .",
    "the bloch - redfield equations for the reduced density - matrix of a quantum dot have been employed in the sequential tunneling regime ( cf",
    ".  e.g.  refs .  ) . here",
    "we demonstrate how to establish similar equations in the cotunneling , or kondo regime , starting from the quantum boltzmann equation .",
    "as an example of a system where the off - diagonal entries of the density matrix become important , we study a system of two quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime , each accommodating a single spin-1/2 , mutually coupled by a spin exchange interaction , @xmath9 .",
    "each dot is contacted by a set of source and drain electrodes as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] .",
    "the eigenstates of the isolated two - impurity system are the singlet and triplet states of the two coupled spins .",
    "nevertheless , cotunneling via the leads may mix the states , whereby the density matrix of the two - impurity system will acquire off - diagonal terms . as demonstrated below , this mixing can only occur in the presence of an applied magnetic field and for asymmetric couplings to the leads .",
    "the simpler case of zero magnetic field has already been analyzed in a previous publication  @xcite . for @xmath10 , the product states of the two spin-1/2 would be a natural basis , but for any finite @xmath9 , perturbation theory should be performed with respect to the singlet / triplet basis .",
    "we will demonstrate how the singlet / triplet basis can be used , even for @xmath10 , as long as the off - diagonal parts of the density matrix are properly taken into account .",
    "we model this four - lead two - impurity kondo model as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] by the hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 labels the leads , which are characterized by the same constant density of states near the fermi level , @xmath13 , but with generally different chemical potentials @xmath14 . the spin - operator @xmath15 denotes respectively the conduction electron spin ( @xmath16 ) and the exchange tunneling operator ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "notice that we do not allow for charge transfer between the two dots .",
    "as we have demonstrated earlier  @xcite , the coupling to two pairs of source , and drain electrodes gives rise to a marked transconductance signal , reflecting the onset of cotunneling current through the left dot , say , when tuning the voltage over the right dot to match the exchange coupling , i.e. @xmath18 .    the eigenstates of the isolated two - impurity spin system are the singlet and triplet states @xmath19 for @xmath20 , however , it would be more reasonable to use the product states @xmath21 are seen to mix : @xmath22 , i.e.  @xmath23 , to describe creation(annihilation ) of a singlet state @xmath24(@xmath25 ) or a triplet state @xmath26(@xmath27 )  @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath28 span an infinite dimensional fock space , which has to be projected onto the physical hilbert space , in which only single occupancy is allowed , i.e.  @xmath29 .",
    "this constraint is enforced by adding a term @xmath30 to the hamiltonian and taking the limit @xmath31  @xcite when calculating physical observables .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the four states are @xmath32 and therefore @xmath33 in terms of the pseudo bosons , the spin-1/2 operators at the left / right dot are given by @xmath34 or in compact notation , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a vector of three 4x4 matrices , @xmath38 , defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth noting that the representation of @xmath41 , eqs .   and",
    ", does not include an @xmath42 term , but only transition operators from a singlet to a triplet state .",
    "this implies , for example , that exchange - tunneling current can not pass through either of the two quantum dots if the two - impurity system is in the singlet state .",
    "interestingly , the excitation gap , @xmath9 , to the current - carrying triplet states can be overcome by a finite bias across either of the two dots .",
    "this gives rise to a pronounced transconductance signal , which we have investigated earlier in ref .  .",
    "this work was restricted to zero magnetic field and hence avoided the problem of off - diagonal terms in the nonequilibrium correlation functions .",
    "assuming the exchange - tunneling to be weak , i.e.  @xmath43 , we shall determine the singlet - triplet occupation numbers by means of nonequilibrium perturbation theory .",
    "we employ contour - ordered green s functions arranged in the matrix - form @xmath44 satisfying the dyson equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the dressed and bare contour - ordered matrix green s functions and @xmath48 is the self energy .",
    "whereas the information on the energy spectrum , including any shifts by external fields , is encoded in the retarded green s function @xmath49 , the information on the thermodynamic state of the system , i.e.  the occupation of the energy levels , is contained in @xmath50 out of equilibrium , these two functions are not simply connected through a fluctuation - dissipation theorem and instead one must solve one more component of the matrix dyson equation , @xmath51 an equivalent equation is obtained by applying @xmath52 to the second time argument in @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) .",
    "in contrast to the dyson equation for @xmath53 this quantum boltzmann equation is a self - consistent equation for @xmath54 , since @xmath55 also depends on @xmath54 and since no unrenormalized @xmath56 is known for an isolated quantum impurity . in the limit of vanishing coupling to the leads ,",
    "@xmath54 is found to be independent of that coupling .",
    "therefore the occupation number @xmath57 can take a finite limiting value dependent on the system parameters temperature , bias voltage and magnetic field in @xmath58th order in the coupling to the leads ( cf . also refs .  ) . in the example of a two - impurity system , the _ pb _",
    "green s functions form a matrix in the singlet - triplet ( st ) basis @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 where only the elements allowed by symmetry are shown .",

    "the difference between the bose and the fermi statistics for the pseudo particles is then seen to vanish .",
    "any term containing a product of two occupation numbers @xmath67 will be projected out at the end of the calculation .      the first order ( in @xmath68 ) pseudo - boson self energy is proportional to the spin polarization of the conduction electrons .",
    "it provides only a correction to the g - factor of the local spin and will be neglected in the following .",
