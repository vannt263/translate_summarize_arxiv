    "understanding the formation and properties of the first stars , formed out of pure h / he gas at the end of the cosmic dark ages , is one of the key problems in modern cosmology ( e.g. barkana & loeb 2001 ; bromm & larson 2004 ) . within the standard @xmath5 cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm ) model of structure formation ( e.g. spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) , the first stars are predicted to have formed in ` minihaloes ' of total mass @xmath6 at redshifts @xmath7 ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ; yoshida et al .",
    "their emergence signalled a fundamental transition in cosmic history , from an initial state of simplicity to one of increasing complexity ( e.g. ciardi & ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "specifically , the first stars enriched the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with the first heavy elements ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; madau , ferrara & rees 2001 ; mackey , bromm & hernquist 2003 ; furlanetto & loeb 2003 , 2005 ; scannapieco , schneider & ferrara 2003 ; bromm , yoshida & hernquist 2003 ; yoshida , bromm & hernquist 2004 ; schneider et al .",
    "secondly , they contributed to the reionization of the universe , as inferred from the optical depth to thomson scattering measured by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ; spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) , due to their efficient production of ionizing photons . to elucidate these feedback effects",
    ", we have to ask : what were the properties of the first generations of metal - free stars ?",
    "numerical simulations imply that star formation inside ` minihaloes ' relied on molecular hydrogen cooling , and resulted in typically very massive so - called population  iii ( pop  iii ) stars with characteristic masses @xmath3 ( bromm , coppi & larson 1999 , 2002 ; abel , bryan & norman 2000 , 2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2001 ) .",
    "minihaloes are characterized by virial temperatures below @xmath8  k , and the star forming gas did not go through an ionized phase , prior to the late stages of the protostellar accretion process . in environments , however , where such ionization did occur , the thermal evolution of the primordial gas is predicted to have been markedly different ( see johnson & bromm 2006a , b for details ) .",
    "this difference arises because the hydrogen deuteride ( hd ) molecule provides an additional cooling channel , allowing the metal - free gas to cool to temperatures below those possible solely via h@xmath9 cooling ( e.g. flower et al . 2000 ; galli & palla 2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ) .",
    "gas fragmentation in cases where hd cooling is important could therefore have resulted in metal - free stars that were somewhat less massive than ` classical ' pop  iii stars .",
    "these stars , having typical masses @xmath2 , have been termed population  ii.5 ( pop  ii.5 ) , indicating their transitional status in terms of typical mass and formation epoch between pop  iii and pop  i / ii ( mackey et al .",
    "2003 ; johnson & bromm 2006a ) . connected to this ,",
    "tumlinson , venkatesan & shull ( 2004 ) and tumlinson ( 2006a , b ) , together with other groups , have argued that the observed chemical abundances in metal - poor galactic halo stars are best explained by assuming that the first stars were somewhat less massive , different from the theoretical expectation ( see section  4 ) .",
    "our model could provide a natural explanation for such an intermediate mass scale , both in terms of the physics of primordial gas cooling and in terms of the cosmological environment where such stars could have formed .",
    "the conditions necessary for hd cooling to become important were possibly met in a number of high-@xmath10 environments ( johnson & bromm 2006a ) . among them",
    "are fossil hii regions , left behind after the death of a pop  iii star ( e.g. nagakura & omukai 2005 ; susa & umemura 2006 ; johnson & bromm 2006a , b ; abel , wise & bryan 2006 ) , and shocks induced either by the first supernova ( sn ) explosions ( e.g. machida et al . 2005 ) , or as a result of hierarchical structure formation during the assembly of the first dwarf galaxies ( e.g. uehara & inutsuka 2000 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ) . in this paper , we consider in particular the latter possibility , assuming that pop  ii.5 stars formed during the virialization of primordial haloes with virial temperatures @xmath11  k , which is sufficient to ionize the collapsing gas .    in the following ,",
    "we construct separate cosmic star formation histories for the two distinct populations of metal - free stars ( section  2 ) .",
    "we then compare the ionizing photon and heavy element production of our model to observations ( section  3 ) , and conclude by summarizing our results and discussing the relevance of our work in light of recent developments ( section  4 ) .    throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt a @xmath5cdm model of hierarchical structure formation , with cosmological parameters consistent with the _ wmap _ 3-yr results ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) , i.e. density in matter @xmath12 , density in baryons @xmath13 , hubble parameter @xmath14 , tilt @xmath15 and a normalization of the power spectrum to @xmath16 . for calculations involving the latter , we use the transfer function of eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) .",
    "as the very first generation of stars to form out of primordial gas , pop  iii has been investigated extensively over the last decade ( e.g. barkana & loeb 2001 ; bromm & larson 2004 ; ciardi & ferrara 2005 ; glover 2005 ) . already prior to the first numerical simulations of early structure formation , molecular hydrogen was identified as the primary coolant for pure h / he gas ( e.g. peebles & dicke 1968 ; couchman & rees 1986 ; tegmark et al .",
    "this view has been confirmed by detailed simulations since 1996 ( e.g. haiman et al .",
    "1996 ; abel et al .",

    "2003 , 2006 ) . within variants of the cdm model , the first stars",
    "are predicted to have formed in minihaloes of total mass @xmath17 at redshifts @xmath7 .",
    "such minihaloes have virial temperatures in excess of a minimum value , @xmath18 , required for collapsing gas to cool in less than a hubble time ( e.g. haiman et al . 1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 , yoshida et al .",
    "the evolution of gas inside minihaloes , driven by h@xmath9 cooling , leads to the formation of protostellar fragments with typical masses @xmath3 ( bromm et al . 1999 , 2002 ; abel et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; yoshida et al .",
    "we adopt this characteristic mass scale , and assume throughout this paper that pop  iii has an extremely top - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) with cutoffs at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and a standard salpeter ( 1955 ) slope .",
    "consistent with simulation results ( abel et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ) and recent semianalytic treatments predicting a low pop  iii star formation efficiency ( e.g. haiman & bryan 2006 ; choudhury & ferrara 2006 ) , we assume @xmath21 , which corresponds to @xmath22 stars per halo",
    ". however , since uncertainties remain , we will reconsider our choice of this crucial quantity in later sections .      a straigthforward semianalytic approach to determine the star formation rate ( sfr ) for pop  iii is given by the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) , providing an expression for the abundance of dark matter haloes .",
    "an improved fit to simulation results is obtained by assuming ellipsoidal instead of spherical collapse , introduced by sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) . in quantitative studies ( e.g. heitmann et al .",
    "2006 ; reed et al .",
    "2006 ) , the sheth - tormen ( st ) approach has proven to be significantly more accurate , with maximum deviations of @xmath23  per  cent , leading us to adopt this formalism for all further calculations . by comparison , the ps mass function underpredicts the abundance of haloes at very high redshifts by almost an order of magnitude , although our qualitative results remain unaffected .    using the st approximation , we can estimate the number of dark matter haloes , @xmath24 , per unit mass and comoving volume at a given redshift : @xmath25 since only a small fraction of haloes is massive enough to fulfil the cooling condition imposed by @xmath26 , we must adjust the limits of integration appropriately when calculating the collapsed fraction of mass , @xmath27 , available for pop  iii star formation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total mass density of the background universe . the limits in the integral , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are related to the virial temperature by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean molecular weight , i.e. @xmath34 for neutral and @xmath35 for ionized , primordial gas .",
    "since the universe is mostly neutral at high redshifts , we choose @xmath36 for all further calculations .",
    "the lower mass limit in the integral corresponds to the minimum virial temperature below which haloes can not cool efficiently .",
    "we set the upper limit to @xmath37 , as haloes with masses @xmath38 go through a more complicated cooling process , leading to the formation of stars with characteristic masses @xmath2 , termed pop  ii.5 .",
    "this novel generation of stars will be discussed in section  2.2 .    applying the above criteria",
    ", we obtain a preliminary form for the pop  iii sfr : @xmath39 the solid line in panel  ( b ) of fig .",
    "1 shows the result , implying that pop  iii star formation peaks around @xmath40 , and declines sharply towards @xmath41 , as an increasing number of minihaloes merge into larger haloes with masses above @xmath42 .",
    "we emphasize that this is _ not _ the final sfr , as we have neglected all forms of feedback . in the next few sections",
    ", we will therefore investigate the impact of relevant feedback mechanisms on pop  iii .      at some point during primordial star formation ,",
    "negative feedback effects must have become important , eventually terminating the pop  iii mode , as stars in the present - day universe are characterized by much higher metallicities and typically have low masses .",
    "perhaps the most relevant negative feedback mechanism is heating due to photoionization ( photoheating ) , since massive pop  iii stars produce vast amounts of ionizing photons ( e.g. tumlinson & shull 2000 ; bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001b ; schaerer 2002 ) , with escape fractions around unity ( whalen , abel & norman 2004 ; kitayama & yoshida 2005 ; alvarez , bromm & shapiro 2006a ) . related to this ,",
    "other radiative feedback mechanisms have also been considered ( for a recent review , see ciardi & ferrara 2005 ) .    of particular importance",
    "is the impact of radiation in the lyman - werner ( lw ) bands on neighbouring minihaloes , which might readily dissociate h@xmath9 and suppress efficient cooling ( e.g. haiman , rees & loeb 1997 ; omukai & nishi 1999 ; ciardi , ferrara & abel 2000 ; haiman , abel & rees 2000 ; machacek , bryan & abel 2001 ; ricotti , gnedin & shull 2001 , 2002a , b ; kitayama et al .",
    "2001 ; glover & brand 2001 ; yoshida et al . 2003",
    "; omukai & yoshii 2003 ; mesinger , bryan & haiman 2006 ; macintyre , santoro & thomas 2006 ) . despite the extensive effort",
    ", no consensus has yet been reached on the overall significance of this effect .",
    "alternatively , positive feedback due to an early x - ray background produced by relic black holes has been suggested ( e.g. haiman et al .",
    "2000 ; machacek , bryan & abel 2003 ; glover & brand 2003 ) .",
    "pop  iii stars in the range @xmath19    @xmath43 and @xmath44  ",
    "@xmath20 are expected to collapse directly to black holes after their main sequence lifetimes of @xmath45 ( heger et al .",
    "2003 ) , emitting x - rays during the subsequent accretion of gas .",
    "other possible sources include x - ray binaries and sn remnants ( e.g. natarajan & almaini 2000 ; helfand & moran 2001 ) . the buildup of an early x - ray background could enhance the production of free electrons in neighbouring minihaloes , thereby increasing the h@xmath9 fraction and consequently the cooling rate .",
    "this would result in an increase of pop  iii star formation and could possibly compensate for negative feedback caused by photoheating or lw radiation .",
    "based on the revised value of the optical depth to thomson scattering ( e.g. spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) , we find that pop  iii must have been terminated fairly rapidly ( see section  3 ) .",
    "this leads us to concentrate on negative feedback , and in the following we will discuss the impact of the lw background , and subsequently of photoheating , on primordial star formation .",
    "the high masses and surface temperatures of pop  iii stars give rise to yields of the order of @xmath46 ionizing photons per stellar baryon ( e.g bromm et al .",
    "2001b ; schaerer 2002 ) . naturally , the flux in the lw bands is also high , dissociating h@xmath47 in neighbouring haloes and reducing the fraction of gas that can cool efficiently . to describe this feedback mechanism ,",
    "we must find a connection between the background lw flux and the cooling rate of a halo , and also between the mass in stars and the associated photon yields .    for simplicity , we assume that all emitted lw photons escape into the igm , and are thus available for h@xmath9-dissociation in a nearby minihalo , but account for the redshifting of photons out of the lw bands .",
    "this approach clearly overestimates the lw background , yet will turn out to be instructive when discussing the results .",
    "the buildup of a homogeneous lw background proceeds over a very short period of time , since the comoving mean free path of a lw photon at @xmath48 is @xmath4  mpc ( mackey et al .",
    "often , the presence of such a pervading background has been assumed in investigating the cooling process of a minihalo under lw irradiation . specifically , machacek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have derived an analytic fit to their simulation results , giving an estimate of the gas fraction that cools and reaches high densities as a function of halo mass and lw flux : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the flux in the lw bands , such that : @xmath51 .",
    "this formula explicitly shows that h@xmath47 cooling rates rise towards higher halo masses , enabling them to withstand larger amounts of lw flux .",
    "averaging this fraction over the halo mass range hosting pop  iii , and ` normalizing ' it to the value obtained for an absent lw background , yields the mass fraction of gas available for star formation as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath52 : @xmath53 where the normalisation accounts for the fact that machacek et al .",
    "( 2001 ) imply a definition for the star formation efficiency different from our choice of a constant @xmath54 , independent of halo mass .",
    "thus , the sfr at any given redshift is reduced relative to the no - feedback sfr of equation  ( 4 ) by precisely this factor : @xmath55 where @xmath52 is implicitly a function of redshift as it is linked to the mass already incorporated into stars . to complete the feedback cycle",
    ", we must therefore connect the lw flux with the comoving density in stars , @xmath56 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the ratio of mean lw frequency to the relevant bandwidth is of the order of unity : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of photons emitted in the lw bands per stellar baryon , and : @xmath59 such that @xmath60 corresponds to the maximum distance a lw photon can travel before it is redshifted out of the lw bands . since all stellar populations contribute to the lw background , possibly with distinct values for @xmath61 , the star formation histories of pop  ii.5 and pop  i / ii are directly linked to pop  iii .",
    "schaerer ( 2002 ) has provided time - integrated spectral properties of metal - free stars over a wide range of masses , and our calculations of @xmath61 are based on this work . for pop  iii ,",
    "we integrate over the salpeter - weighted mass range @xmath19  ",
    "@xmath20 , which results in @xmath62 . as will be discussed in more detail later in this paper , pop  ii.5",
    "is assumed to have masses @xmath2 , leading us to adopt mass cut - offs at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and again a standard salpeter slope . using the spectra of schaerer ( 2002 )",
    ", we find @xmath65 . for pop",
    "i / ii , we adopt @xmath66 , which is comparable to the ionizing flux . the explicit sfrs used for pop  ii.5 and pop",
    "i / ii correspond to the feedback parameter @xmath67 , which will be discussed later .",
    "we note , however , that varying this parameter hardly affects our results .",
    "applying the above treatment allows us to describe pop  iii star formation in an evolving lw background .",
    "our calculation is shown in fig .  1 ( dotted line ) , compared to the no - feedback case ( solid line ) . somewhat surprisingly , the overall amplitude of the effect is not too high , although we have conservatively assumed that no lw photons are lost .",
    "on the other hand , we have not included the effect of biasing since the build - up of a homogenuous lw background is very rapid .",
    "the shape of the modified sfr is also quite interesting , and can be explained by a decomposition into two competing processes : as the lw background increases , the pop  iii sfr tends to decline , yet as haloes become more massive , they can sustain higher lw fluxes , enabling ongoing pop  iii star formation towards lower redshifts . to summarize , lw feedback might not be as efficient as previously assumed ( e.g. haiman et al .",
    "1997 ; mackey et al .",
    "2003 ) , yet for definitive conclusions one must apply detailed numerical simulations that self - consistently solve the hydrodynamics and radiative transfer .    .",
    "we here consider the lw radiation produced by all stellar populations .",
    "( b ) the sfr for pop  iii , neglecting all feedback effects ( solid line ) , and after inclusion of lw feedback ( dotted line).,width=302,height=302 ]      the emergence of the first hii regions around star - forming haloes has an important effect on high - redshift star formation .",
    "the temperature of ionized bubbles is raised to @xmath68 , quenching star formation in affected regions , as primordial gas can no longer condense into the shallow gravitational wells of minihaloes . since pop  iii stars produce copious amounts of ionizing photons , with escape fractions of the order of unity ( e.g. alvarez et al .",
    "2006a ) , and haloes are strongly biased at these high redshifts , photoheating could in fact be a dominant feedback mechanism for pop  iii ( e.g. kramer & haiman 2006 ) . to quantify this feedback ,",
    "we begin with given ionization histories , and assume that pop  iii star formation is suppressed by a factor equal to the volume filling fraction of ionized regions , @xmath69 , weighted by the mean correlation between haloes . with this treatment , we might overestimate the strength of the feedback , as already - collapsed haloes are subject to photoevaporation rather than infall suppression due to photoheating , the former being a much slower process ( e.g. shapiro , iliev & raga 2004 ; iliev , shapiro & raga 2005 ) .",
    "however , since the collapse of neighboring minihaloes is synchronized only to within @xmath70 , compared to propagation times of the first hii regions of @xmath71 ( e.g. alvarez et al .",
    "2006a ) , we expect that most haloes have not yet reached high enough densities to be subject to photoevaporation .    to explicitly determine the effect of biasing , we use the well - known linear correlation function @xmath72 between two haloes of mass @xmath73 at a comoving distance @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the linear bias of a halo of mass @xmath73 and @xmath77 is the mass correlation function ( e.g. mo & white 2002 ) . since haloes are distributed according to the st function , we can determine the average bias at any given redshift : @xmath78 which replaces @xmath76 in equation  ( 10 ) .",
    "the second step consists of linking the volume filling fraction of ionized regions to the typical size of an ionized bubble , which we do by assuming that the volume of a typical hii region is equal to @xmath69 divided by the current number density of haloes , @xmath79 : @xmath80    with these preparations , we can ascertain the probability @xmath81 that a freshly collapsed halo lies within an already existing hii region : @xmath82\\mbox{\\ , } \\ ] ] where the halo correlation function @xmath83 adopts the interpretation of an excess probability .",
    "this enables us to write the modified sfr with respect to the no - feedback sfr as : @xmath84\\psi_{*}(z)\\mbox{\\ .}\\ ] ] to calculate the sfrs we must supply reionization histories , and choose gaussian functions of the form @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 corresponds to early , intermediate and late reionization , respectively . for all three cases , reionization ends at @xmath89 , thus being in agreement with observations suggesting that the universe was completely ionized by @xmath90 , e.g. the absence of the gunn & peterson ( 1965 ) trough in the spectra of high - redshift quasars , and considerations of the thermal history of the igm ( e.g. theuns et al . 2002 ; hui & haiman 2003 ) . additionally , the three reionization histories reproduce optical depths of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , thus spanning the current error bars of the _ wmap _ measurement . for the three different values of @xmath94",
    "as mentioned above , panel  ( a ) in fig .",
    "2 shows early ( dotted line ) , intermediate ( dashed line ) and late ( dot - dashed line ) reionization , whereas panel  ( b ) traces the modified sfrs derived from these reionization histories . as is evident from the plots , the different epochs of reionization lead to vastly different sfrs , with efficiencies varying by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "this is primarily an effect of halo biasing , amplifying the impact of small volume filling fractions @xmath95 .",
    "we tentatively conclude that pop  iii ends very rapidly once a small number of minihaloes have formed stars .    at this point",
    ", it is important to note that we have not yet derived self - consistent reionization and star formation histories .",
    "however , it is instructive to outline the range of possibilities and defer conclusions about the most likely and self - consistent scenario to later sections .",
    "the term pop  iii has traditionally been used to denote stars forming in extremely low metallicity environments , independent of the associated halo mass . in the following",
    ", we will deviate from this terminology , and instead distinguish between two populations of metal - free stars according to the environments in which they form .",
    "we thereby propose an intermediate stellar generation between pop  iii and pop  i / ii ( see mackey et al . 2003 ; johnson & bromm 2006a ) .    as discussed in section  2.1 , haloes in the range @xmath96  ",
    "@xmath97 cool almost exclusively by molecular hydrogen transitions , and produce stars with an extremely top - heavy imf .",
    "yet gas assembled in more massive haloes goes through an ionized phase and experiences a different cooling process ( johnson & bromm 2006a , b ) . in this process",
    ", hd cooling allows the gas temperature to reach that of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) within a hubble time . by reaching the cmb limit ,",
    "these haloes produce stars with typical masses @xmath2 , about an order of magnitude less than is the case for pop  iii ( johnson & bromm 2006a ) .",
    "associating this intermediate generation of stars with metal - free haloes above @xmath98 allows us to derive a sfr for pop  ii.5 .      to obtain a preliminary sfr for pop  ii.5",
    ", we once again apply the st formalism , yet adjust the limits of integration when determining the collapsed mass fraction by setting the lower limit to @xmath99 and the upper limit to infinity .",
    "this satisfies the conditions for their formation sites , as these haloes go through an ionized phase in the course of their virialization ( e.g. johnson & bromm 2006a ) .",
    "the sfr is computed according to equation  ( 4 ) , except that we use a different star formation efficiency , @xmath100 .",
    "this choice reflects the intermediate nature of pop  ii.5 between pop  iii and pop  i / ii , and will be further justified in later sections . the solid line in panel  ( b ) of fig .",
    "3 shows the resulting sfr , implying that pop  ii.5 produces stars about an order of magnitude more efficiently than pop  iii ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , but also peaks at later times .      due to the deep potential wells of typical pop  ii.5 haloes ( @xmath101 ) , and the fact that cooling by atomic hydrogen sets in , photoheating is no longer a dominant feedback mechanism . specifically , dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have shown that suppression of gas infall is not as efficient in the high - redshift universe as it is for @xmath102 .",
    "we performed calculations including infall suppression in ionized regions of the igm and verified this conclusion .",
    "efficient self - shielding of ionized gas assembled in more massive haloes also renders lw feedback unimportant ( see johnson & bromm 2006b ) .",
    "consequently , pop  ii.5 can only be terminated by chemical feedback , as multiple sne in a host galaxy combine to form so - called ` superwinds ' , expanding into the igm and enriching neighbouring haloes with metals ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "2001 ; mori , ferrara & madau 2002 ; furlanetto & loeb 2003 , 2005 ; wada & venkatesan 2003 ) . in the next section",
    ", we will therefore introduce a semianalytic model describing chemical enrichment , which subsequently leads to the termination of pop  ii.5 .",
    "once the metallicity of the igm exceeds a critical level , the formation of primordial , metal - free stars is suppressed and star formation switches to a more conventional mode ( e.g. omukai 2000 ; bromm et al .",
    "2001a ; schneider et al .",
    "the precise value of this ` critical metallicity ' is still heavily debated , as some authors argue that dust production in the early universe might be responsible for lowering @xmath103 to almost @xmath104 ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , due to remaining uncertainties we choose the more robust value @xmath105 , which is based on the physics of fine structure cooling , and does not depend on whether dust is present or not , and if so , what its composition might be ( e.g. bromm et al .",

    "pop  iii stars in the range @xmath43    @xmath106 explode as pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) , with substantial metal yields @xmath107 ( heger et al . 2003 ) , yet due to their rare nature they are likely inefficient polluters ( also see section  3.3 ) . we therefore suggest that pop  ii.5 is largely responsible for enriching the igm above the critical threshold and quenching metal - free star formation .    in modelling the propagation and distribution of metals , we closely follow the semianalytic treatment of sne winds performed by furlanetto & loeb ( 2005 ) . utilizing the well - known sedov ( 1959 ) solution of an expanding bubble in a uniform background",

    "<S> we construct star formation histories at redshifts @xmath0 for two physically distinct populations of primordial , metal - free stars , motivated by theoretical and observational arguments that have hinted towards the existence of an intermediate stellar generation between population  iii and population  i / ii . taking into account the cosmological parameters as recently revised by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe </S>",
    "<S> _ after three years of operation , we determine self - consistent reionization histories and discuss the resulting chemical enrichment from these early stellar generations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bulk of ionizing photons and heavy elements produced at high redshifts must have originated in population  ii.5 stars , which formed out of primordial gas in haloes with virial temperatures @xmath1 , and had typical masses @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> classical population  iii stars , formed in minihaloes and having masses @xmath3 , on the other hand , had only a minor impact on reionization and early metal enrichment . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we conclude that only @xmath4  per  cent by mass of metal - free star formation went into population  iii .    </S>",
