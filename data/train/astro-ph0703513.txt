    "observatory has opened an important new window onto the highest energy astrophysical processes with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution @xcite . of the 22 galactic tev sources detected by _ hess _  over the first two years of four - telescope operation , nearly half are associated with supernova products  supernova remnants ( snrs ) or pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) @xcite . with the exception of two associations with binary systems ,",
    "the remainder have yet to be identified with a known source at any other wavelength .",
    "the growing number of supernova products associated _ hess _  sources provide a unique opportunity to locate new examples of these objects and to determine the mechanism(s ) for generating their @xmath7-ray photons .",
    "in this paper we focus on g12.82@xmath00.02 , the first case of a snr located by its tev emission @xcite .",
    "this previously uncatalogued faint shell - type radio supernova remnant ( diameter @xmath9 ) lies within the error circle of the unidentified source @xcite .",
    "it was soon found to be coincident with an unpublished non - thermal 210  kev _ asca _  x - ray source @xcite , a 10100  kev _ integral _  hard x - ray source @xcite , and a 0.410  tev _ magic _",

    "xmm_-newton  x - ray observation , the 210  kev x - ray morphology suggests a composite remnant interacting with ambient material to produce the tev emission @xcite",
    ".    herein we report on a high - resolution x - ray imaging observation of g12.82@xmath00.02  obtained with the _ chandra _  observatory .",
    "this new data allows us to associate this remnant with a young , energetic rotation - powered pulsar generating a bright wind nebula , ultimately responsible for the tev emission from . in the following we use a distance to g12.82@xmath00.02of @xmath10  kpc as suggested by @xcite",
    "a 30  ks x - ray observation of snr g12.82@xmath00.02  was obtained on 2006 sept 15 ut using the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory ( see @xcite for a full description of this observation ) .",
    "data were collected with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) in the focal plane , operating in the nominal full - frame timed / vfaint exposure mode .",
    "the coordinates of the _ asca _  source associated with g12.82@xmath00.02  were positioned on the acis - i3 ccd chip and offset by @xmath11 from the nominal aimpoint to allow any extended x - ray emission from the source to fall wholly on this chip .",
    "a total of 29.6  ks of live - time was accumulated with a ccd frame time of 3.241  s ( 1.3% deadtime ) .",
    "we used the pipeline level 2 event products and reduced and analyzed this data using the standard x - ray analysis software .",
    "as shown in figure  1 , the _ chandra _  acis image of g12.82@xmath00.02 , with a near on - axis spatial resolution of @xmath12 , fully resolves the _ asca _  source into diffuse x - ray emission and a point source .",
    "the diffuse flux generally fills in the radio shell and peaks toward the point source emission , located at ra = 18:13:35.17 , dec = -17:49:57.48 ( j2000 ; @xmath13 error radius of @xmath14 ) .",
    "these coordinates were determined after registering the image using nine x - ray field stars with usno - b1 optical counterparts , and lies less than @xmath15 from the maximum probability centroid of , well within its @xmath16 ( @xmath13 ) extent .",
    "the point source is clearly offset from the center of the nearly symmetric radio remnant , by @xmath17 .",
    "this suggests either rapid source motion or asymmetric snr expansion relative to a common birth center .",
    "extending west / southwest of the source is a faint localized loop of emission not clearly resolved ( figure  1 , middle plot ) .",
    "a radial profile centered on the point source shows that this excess emission is prominent out to @xmath18 and disappears into the background at about @xmath19 .",
    "the profile of the point emission is consistent with the mirror response function when the large - scale diffuse flux is taken into account .",
    "no obvious evidence is found for any x - ray structure corresponding to the radio shell .    to further study the nature of the x - ray emission from g12.82@xmath00.02  we extracted spectra from the point source , the diffuse nebula , and the faint inner nebula , and from appropriate background regions .",
    "a total of 864 photons were collected from a @xmath20 radius aperture centered on cxou j181335.17@xmath21174957.4 ; this included @xmath22 background counts , estimated from the local diffuse emission . because of the low count rates involved , photon pile - up is negligible . to encompass the bulk of the nebula",
    ", we define an @xmath23-radius region , centered on the remnant , with the point source and inner nebula regions excluded ( see below ) ; a total of 6638 photons were obtained .",
    "the background for this spectrum was extracted from a @xmath24-radius circle offset due north of the nebula region and contained 1363 counts . for the inner nebula",
    "we use a @xmath25 elliptical extraction region tilted with a position angle of @xmath26 with the point source excluded . after accounting for the local background ( 28% )",
    "this resulted in a total of 223 photons .",
    "spectra from each region were grouped for a minimum of 15 cts per spectral channel and fitted using the xspec software in the 210  kev energy band , below which the line - of - sight flux is evidently highly absorbed .",
    "these ccd spectra ( @xmath27 fwhm at 1 kev ) are all well - characterized ( but not uniquely ) by an absorbed power - law model associated with non - thermal emission . for the nebula flux ,",
    "the best - fit photon index is @xmath28 , averaged over this region , with an @xmath29  @xmath30 , consistent with that derived from nanten @xmath31=10 ) measurements @xcite . in fitting the putative pulsar the column density",
    "was fixed to the value derived for the higher - significance nebula spectrum .",
    "the best - fit model yields a surprisingly similar index , @xmath32 , not unlike that found for the vela pulsar , and to be expected for the most energetic rotation - powered pulsars ( cf .",
    "the absorbed 210  kev fluxes for the putative pulsar ( psr ) and pwn are @xmath33  erg  @xmath30  s@xmath3 and @xmath34  erg  @xmath30  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with the _ asca _  measurements of the composite spectrum and , as discussed below , have important implications for the energetics of the system .",
    "the spectral distribution of the inner nebula ( in ) photons is not well - constrained , but a fit with the power - law model yields a somewhat flatter index of @xmath35 than that of the pwn , with a flux of @xmath36  erg  @xmath30  s@xmath3 .",
    "significantly , no emission line features are found in any of the spectra analyzed .",
    "the _ chandra _  results offer a compelling case that the high - energy emission from g12.82@xmath00.02  is derived from the spin - down energy of a young rotation - powered pulsar .",
    "deep radio pulsar searches , however , have so far failed to detect a signal from cxou j181335.17@xmath21174957.4  to an upper - limit that approaches those measured for the least luminous young pulsars . nor have searches for slow periodicity using the x - ray data produced evidence of a signal , although these results are not very constraining , with a @xmath37 upper - limit for a sinusoidal modulation of @xmath38 for _ asca _  ( @xmath39  ms ) , 27% for acis ( @xmath40  s ) , and 100% for _ xmm_-newton(@xmath41  ms ) @xcite .",
    "more significant timing searches are needed to verify our pulsar hypothesis for g12.82@xmath00.02 .",
    "a detection will allow a search for pulsed @xmath7-rays with the _ glast_mission .",
    "together , these results will help fully quantify the energetics of this system .",
    "that the putative pulsar is highly energetic is manifest by the large flux ratio of @xmath42 in the 210  kev energy band ; only rotation - powered pulsars with spin - down energy loss rates above @xmath43  erg  s@xmath3 have a ratio this large or greater @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the total 210  kev luminosity of @xmath44 erg s@xmath3 from g12.82@xmath00.02   corresponds to @xmath45  erg s@xmath3 @xcite , placing this object among the galaxy s top ten most energetic pulsars . in particular",
    ", g12.82@xmath00.02  bears a striking similarity in many respects to snr  g106.6 + 2.9 , a radio remnant undetected in x - rays that contains the energetic pulsar psr  j2229 + 6114 with @xmath46  erg  s@xmath3 and flux ratio of @xmath47 @xcite .    the nature of the inner nebula resolved by the _ chandra _",
    "data is not yet clear .",
    "if we assume that the pulsar s velocity vector is away from the snr center , it is hard to reconcile this feature with a bow - shock origin . as a torus",
    ", it is unusually asymmetric and not well centered on the pulsar .",
    "the relation between this feature and that of the greater nebula requires a deeper _ chandra _  observation to consider further .",
    "the tev emission from  is also likely to be also powered , ultimately , by the putative pulsar .",
    "the spatially coincident x - ray and tev emission is notably rare among the _ hess _  pwns , likely indicating a young ( @xmath48  yr ) pulsar , as in the crab remnant .",
    "tev emission for older systems are considerably offset and may originate from `` relic '' electrons injected at an earlier epoch @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-rays from g12.82@xmath00.02  could result from direct interaction of the wind with the snr shell , but no associated x - rays are seen .",
    "further evidence for this is provided by the tev / x - ray flux ratio of @xmath49 - although this ratio @xcite is the highest among the confirmed pwn @xmath7-ray emitters , it is well below that expected from the interaction of an old snr with a giant molecular cloud , as suggested by yamazaki  @xcite .",
    "the tev photons in this latter scenario arise from @xmath50-decay of accelerated protons and the x - rays are generated via synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons .",
    "a more plausible explanation for the tev emission from g12.82@xmath00.02  is inverse - compton scattering of ambient photons off relativistic electrons accelerated by the pulsar wind . indeed , the remnant s broadband spectrum ( combining radio , x - ray , _ integral _ , and _",
    "hess_data ) is well - fitted using the inverse - compton model , although a large photon field ( 1000 ev @xmath51 ) is required @xcite .",
    "the nearby hii region w33 may provides a significant local infrared photon flux , but it is unlikely to reach the necessary photon density @xcite . given that several tev detected pwne lie near star - formation regions , they may ultimately prove important for generating the tev emission @xcite .",
    "future _ glast _",
    "observation will be critical for constraining possible spectral models and addressing these issues ."
