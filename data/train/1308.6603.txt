    "duality means that two systems describe the same physics although they look different at the first sight .",
    "it is accompanied with a dictionary to translate observables and amplitudes among the two systems . with utilizing the dictionary",
    ", it becomes possible to study different physical regimes of the system .",
    "so far , this is the typical use of duality which has been producing a number of successes in various studies .",
    "string theory is a zoo of dualities , and therefore it connects a large number of theories by various means : s- , t- and u - duality , and so on @xcite . by use of duality ,",
    "string theories with different appearances are related to each other .",
    "importantly , _",
    "duality is believed to act non - perturbatively _ , and it binds the different perturbative pictures to be a single unified theory of our universe . in string theory , therefore , duality is not only a tool for connecting different pictures .",
    "it should also be an intrinsic and fundamental ingredient which constitutes non - perturbative definition of string theory .",
    "we believe that this consideration is particularly important in non - perturbative formulation of string theory and it leads us to the following investigation .    in this paper , we would like to put forward this idea to a quantitative level in full non - perturbative regimes , i.e.  non - perturbative completion , of string theory .",
    "in particular , we argue that _ duality realized in non - perturbative completions imposes constraints on the system rather than a dictionary_. this new fundamental feature of non - perturbative duality is referred to as _ duality constraints _ on the system . here",
    "we elaborate a quantitative evidence of duality constraints within a solvable framework of string theory @xcite . as the first example of duality",
    ", we focus on spectral @xmath0 duality @xcite in lower dimensional ( non - critical ) string theory @xcite . in particular , we argue validity of the duality constraints by analyzing the instanton spectrums on possible variety of spectral networks , which characterize non - perturbative completions of the string theory .    a major motivation of this project is from the issue about _ non - perturbative ambiguity in definition of string",
    "theory_. string theory is so far defined perturbatively .",
    "for instance , free - energy of string theory is given by an asymptotic expansion in string coupling @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 + o(\\theta^2),\\qquad g\\to 0 , \\label{eqintroexpansionoffreeenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the perturbative definition ( like worldsheet formulation ) allows us to obtain all the expansion coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 in principle .",
    "however , such a perturbative calculation does not provide any information about the relative weights for instanton sectors @xmath13 , called _ d - instanton fugacities _ @xcite .",
    "as we will also discuss ( also see @xcite ) , d - instanton fugacities are directly related to _ vacuum structure of string theory _ , which is one of the most important non - perturbative physics in string theory .",
    "despite of this importance , there is no worldsheet concept describing the d - instanton fugacity . by this fact",
    ", there appear a number of undermined free parameters in non - perturbative regimes , especially in the vacuum structure of string theory . in this sense , only after solving this issue , it is possible to capture the whole picture of non - perturbative string theory .",
    "what we argue in this paper is that this issues can be partially resolved by spelling out _ non - perturbative duality _ in string theory .",
    "an intrinsic reason for the non - perturbative ambiguity stems from the ambiguity appearing in borel resummation , which we refer to as _",
    "stokes ambiguity_. note that we should not be confused among non - perturbative ambiguity and stokes ambiguity . as is reviewed in appendix [ appendixnonperturbativevsstokesambiguity ] , these two concepts are different from each other .",
    "stokes ambiguity takes place when the expansion is asymptotic one . in the expansion ,",
    "some of the exponentially small instanton corrections are overwhelmed by relatively large instanton corrections . in this occasion",
    ", the associated d - instanton fugacity covertly changes its value discretely , i.e.  stokes phenomenon occurs . according to the resurgent analysis @xcite",
    ", it is known that perturbation theory can determine all the jump information of stokes phenomenon . however , since d - instanton fugacity plays a role of absorbent of such a jump phenomenon , perturbative description can not assign its primary value to the d - instanton fugacity .",
    "therefore , perturbative theory should be tolerant to variety of d - instanton fugacity and therefore non - perturbative ambiguity .",
    "this does not mean that d - instanton fugacity is not calculable .",
    "for example , if _",
    "`` a '' _ matrix model ( or large @xmath14 gauge theory ) is given , one can evaluate d - instanton fugacity @xcite up to the stokes ambiguity of exponentially small corrections .",
    "one can even reproduce such a result from non - perturbative reconstruction from the perturbative string theory @xcite . however , it is just one of the choices of matrix models . from this point of views ,",
    "non - perturbative ambiguity means that there are a number of different matrix models ( i.e.  with different d - instanton fugacity ) which commonly include perturbative string theory as its asymptotic expansion .",
    "for example , one can find a number of matrix models with _ a different choice of contours _ which still commonly include the same perturbative string theory in its large @xmath14 expansion .",
    "these matrix models with different choices of contour integrals result in non - perturbatively different string theories with different vacuum structures . in this sense , _ non - perturbative ambiguity is the ambiguity in non - perturbative physics of string theory _ , and one can not decide which non - perturbative completions are suitable for `` our '' string theory . therefore , as theoretical physics",
    ", in order to obtain a sufficiently unique string theory , it is important to find out an additional non - perturbative principle to provide a restriction on non - perturbative formulation of string theory .",
    "it is then natural to expect that these ambiguities would be convicted by imposing non - perturbative string duality .",
    "we should note how non - perturbative duality works in general , and how it is different from the perturbative one .",
    "assume that two perturbative string theories ( a and b ) are dual to each other , and that there exist matrix models as non - perturbative completions of each perturbative string theory ( fig .  [ figureintroductiondualityconstraintonmatrices ] ) .",
    "in this occasion , we will see    * _ perturbative duality _ among perturbative string theories ( a and b ) means the equivalence of _ perturbative saddles _ constituted in the a- and b - matrix model .",
    "* _ non - perturbative duality _ among a- and b - matrix model means the equivalence of _ ensembles of perturbative saddles _ realized by the a- and b - matrix model .    in the usual",
    "means , string duality is only checked in a perturbative sense ( by using d - branes and so on ) and has rarely been checked non - perturbatively .",
    "the point is that _ the equivalence of perturbative string theories does not guarantee the equivalence of the two dual matrix - model descriptions because not all the non - perturbative completions are realized by matrix models of both sides .",
    "_ if there appears discrepancy , then it means that we need to restrict the non - perturbative completions , otherwise the non - perturbative string theory is described only by one side of duality .",
