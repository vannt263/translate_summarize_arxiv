    "sub : a - theorem - for ] we formulate and prove results for the structure of the solution of heisenberg equation of motion . section  [ sub : obtaining - the - observables ] provides the reader with the practical details of how to use the mathematical results in obtaining physical observables .",
    "we apply the general method to a three - dimensional non - isotropic harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensate in section  [ sec : results ] and present numerical results for atomic correlation functions that we compare to recently derived analytic short - time asymptotes .",
    "finally the article is summarised in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "to model the dissociations of a bose - einstein condensate of diatomic molecules into pairs of constituent atoms , we start with the following effective quantum field theory hamiltonian    @xmath17    @xmath18    here we assume that the molecules are made of either two distinguishable bosonic atoms or two fermionic atoms in different spin states . in both cases , @xmath19 is a bosonic field operator for the molecules , satisfying the standard commutation relations @xmath20=\\delta^{d}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})$ ] , with @xmath0 being the spatial dimension of the system @xcite .",
    "the atomic field operators , @xmath21 ( @xmath7 ) , satisfy either bosonic commutation or fermionic anti - commutation relations , @xmath22=\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{d}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})$ ] and @xmath23=[\\widehat{\\psi}_{i}(\\mathbf{x},t),\\widehat{\\psi}_{j}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime},t)]=0 $ ] or @xmath24 and @xmath25 , depending on the underlying statistics @xcite .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) describes the kinetic energy where the atomic masses are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , whereas the molecular mass is @xmath28 . for simplicity , we will consider the case of equal atomic masses ( same isotope atoms ) , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath31 is responsible for coherent conversion of molecules into atom pairs , e.g. via optical raman transitions , an rf transition , or a feshbach resonance sweep and microscopic expressions for @xmath8 can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the detuning @xmath32 is defined to give the overall energy mismatch @xmath33 between the free two - atom state in the dissociation threshold and the bound molecular state ( including the relative frequencies of the raman lasers or the frequency of the rf field , again see @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "unstable molecules , spontaneously dissociating into pairs of constituent atoms , correspond to @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the total dissociation energy .    in what follows we will treat the dissociation dynamics in the undepleted molecular condensate approximation in which the molecules are represented as a fixed classical field . the approximation is valid for short enough dissociation times during which the converted fraction of molecules does not exceed about @xmath36 @xcite . in this regime",
    "the dissociation typically produces low density atomic clouds for which the atom - atom @xmath37-wave scattering interactions are negligible . for dissociation into bosonic atoms , also",
    "the effects of atom - atom @xmath37-wave scattering have been investigated in @xcite , and the validity of the undepleted molecular condensate approximation was found to still hold for a converted fraction of molecules up to about 5% .",
    "even though 5%10% conversion efficiencies seem small , nevertheless they can produce mesoscopic ensembles of pair - correlated atoms with interesting quantum statistics and nontrivial many - body correlations if one starts with large - enough molecular condensates , such as containing at least @xmath38@xmath39 molecules .",
    "further on , for dissociation into fermionic atoms in the regime of pauli - blocking , where the atomic occupation numbers are strictly limited by the number of available states @xcite , the undepleted field approximation is expected to be accurate even for large times @xcite .",
    "in addition to the issue about temporal depletion , the atom - molecule interactions will initially appear as an effective spatially dependent detuning due to the mean - field interaction energy  @xcite . to neglect this effect",
    "can be motivated by operating at relatively large absolute values of the dissociation detuning @xmath40 so that it dominates the mean - field energy shift @xcite .",
    "the trapping potential for preparing the initial molecular bec  with any residual atoms being removed  is omitted from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) since we assume that once the dissociation is invoked , the trapping potential is switched off , so that the dynamics of dissociation is taking place in free @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "we assume that the switching on of the atom - molecule coupling @xmath8 and switching off of the trapping potential is done in a sudden jump at time zero .",
    "accordingly the preparation stage is reduced to assuming a certain initial state of the molecular bec in a trap , after which the dynamics is governed by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .      from the heisenberg equation of motion with the hamiltonian taken from ( [ hamiltonian ] )",

    "since the effective hamiltonian corresponding to ( [ eq : heisenberg - eqs])-([eq : heisenberg - eqs_lower ] ) is quadratic in the field operators , higher - order moments or expectation values of products of creation and annihilation operators will factorize according to wick s theorem into products of the normal and anomalous densities @xmath57@xmath58 and @xmath59 . upon applying the fourier transform , the equations (",

    "finally , if the molecular density is non - uniform and time dependent @xmath73 , we need to determine the fourier coefficients ( [ deffouriercoefficients ] ) for each time - step in an iterative process where the dynamics of the molecular mean - field is taken into account .",
    "this is a topic for future work , however , the major effects to be taken into account are : expansion of the condensate @xcite ; temporal depletion of the number of molecules @xcite ; and finally the spatial dependences , such as a larger local dissociation rate in the points of highest initial molecular density @xcite .",
    "defining such an iterative process , the results of the present article will be applicable in each time - step of the evolution .",
    "when the molecular condensate consists of pairs of indistinguishable bosonic atoms of a single spin - state , for example @xmath74rb@xmath75 @xcite , heisenberg equation for one bosonic operator describe the dissociation dynamics @xcite .",
    "a similar set of heisenberg equations for bosonic operators of one spin - state can also be formulated for the dynamics of condensate collisions within the time - dependent bogoliubov approach @xcite .",
    "hence , also for this problem the method discussed in the present article can be applied @xcite .",
    "for a reference we start with presenting the relevant results for a size - matched uniform system .",

    "in contrast to this , for fermionic atoms , the atomic occupations undergo sinusoidal oscillations and can be kept to a small fraction of the number of molecules also for large times . as noted in @xcite the moments ( [ eq : uniform_nk ] ) and ( [ eq : uniform_mk ] )",

    "we have used a truncation of the molecular bec source such that fourier coefficients with a modulus less than 2% of the leading coefficient is neglected .",
    "this procedure have been evaluated by reconstruction of the bec by the inverse fourier transform .",
    "it was also found that the 2% level of truncation resulted in correlation functions ( see figure  [ fig : atom - atom - correlation - functions ] ) that could not be distingushable by the eye from the correlation functions obtained with a 4% level of truncation .      for @xmath296 the thomas - fermi ( tf ) density profile of the molcular bec",

    "we are here interested in collinear ( cl ) density correlations between two momentum components at @xmath51 and @xmath345 , for which the displacement @xmath346 is along one of the cartesian coordinates , @xmath347 .",
    "the detailed derivation of short - time asymptotes for the correlation functions in this case was reported in @xcite .",

    "we have described how to effectivelly calculate the dynamics of linear heisenberg operator equations for the fermi - bose model applied to the problem of molecular dissociation .",
    "we note that a similar framework have been used to obtain numerical results for a non - isotropic 2d system on a @xmath353 grid in @xcite .",
    "we have here generalized the approch to @xmath0 spatial dimensions with the use of @xmath0-block - hankel matrices .",
    "in particular we have explicitly explored a non - isotropic 3d system on a @xmath292 grid numerically on a standard pc .",
    "such a grid can resolve relevant atom dynamics in momentum space for realistic parameters @xcite , and naturally extends earlier studies of non - uniform 1d and 2d systems @xcite , and is more realistic than previous treatments of uniform 3d systems @xcite .",
    "we finally stress that the results presented can be used to handle a complex bosonic mean - field of any geometry in any spatial dimension .",
