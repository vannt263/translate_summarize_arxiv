    "the central regions of elliptical galaxies are thought to form in compact starbursts @xcite .",
    "feedback associated with such starbursts can produce outflows driven by thermal energy from supernova explosions @xcite , stellar winds @xcite , and momentum input from both supernova ram pressure and radiation pressure on dust grains @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that such feedback imposes a limit on the maximum star - formation rate ( sfr ) surface density ( @xmath6 ) for starbursts @xcite and the maximum stellar surface density for elliptical galaxies and star clusters @xcite .",
    "galactic winds are ubiquitous in star - forming galaxies at all redshifts and generally exhibit outflow velocities in the 100500  km  s@xmath2  range , which can be attributed to the stellar processes described above @xcite .",
    "outflows with significantly higher velocities ( @xmath7  km  s@xmath2 ) were discovered by @xcite in a sample of massive ( @xmath8  m@xmath4 ) post - starburst galaxies at @xmath0 , and it was suggested that a more energetic source such as feedback from an accreting supermassive black hole @xcite may be responsible for launching the winds ( see * ? ? ?",

    "however , it is also plausible that feedback from a compact starburst could expel gas with such large velocities . indeed , there is evidence for a positive correlation between outflow velocity and starburst luminosity @xcite , albeit with significant scatter .",
    "furthermore , @xcite recently found outflows with maximum velocities reaching @xmath9  km  s@xmath2  in a sample of local starbursts with compact nuclei , and argued that such velocities could be explained by a wind launched from @xmath10  pc and driven by feedback from massive stars and supernovae .    in this letter",

    "we seek to test whether the energetic outflows in these galaxies could have been driven by feedback from starbursts with very large sfr surface densities .",

    "the dithered images were processed with multidrizzle to produce science mosaics with @xmath24 pixels . for each galaxy , we use galfit @xcite to model the two - dimensional surface brightness profile with a single sersic component ( characterized by sersic index @xmath25 and effective radius @xmath26 ) , using stars in the images to construct the model point - spread function ( psf ) . in cases",
    "where the best - fit model returns @xmath27 , we also fit an @xmath28 de vaucouleurs model , yielding a larger @xmath26 value ( due to the covariance between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) ; we use these larger effective radii in our analysis .    in this letter",

    "this comparison illustrates that this galaxy , while only marginally resolved with an @xmath26 that is @xmath32 of the image fwhm , is clearly more extended than a point source .",
    "for such a compact source , there is uncertainty in our @xmath26 measurement given uncertainties in the model psf . to quantify this , we used tinytim to generate a model psf that is narrower than the stars in the image ( convolving with a @xmath33 gaussian , whereas the image fwhm is @xmath34 ) and found that this increased the @xmath26 in the galfit model by a factor of two .",
    "we also fit a two - component psf+sersic model , but found that the sersic component dominates the fit , yielding a similar @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of the galaxy shows no evidence for an agn contribution to the optical continuum ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) , so there is no clear motivation for including an unresolved , point - source component in the model .",

    "this yields sfrs that agree with those obtained from the @xcite method based on 24  @xmath11 m luminosity with a scatter of 0.05  dex .",
    "several authors have shown that the shape of the ir sed for star - forming galaxies depends on @xmath6 @xcite , with more compact starbursts having larger total - ir ( 81000  @xmath11 m ) to mid - ir ( 824  @xmath11 m ) ratios , characteristic of the most luminous galaxies in the local universe @xcite . if we used the most luminous local templates for the 8/25 sources with sfrs in the ulirg regime ( @xmath37  m@xmath4  yr@xmath2 ) , we would obtain sfrs that are larger by 0.5  dex than the values we adopt for this letter .",

    "the observed h@xmath41 luminosities , uncorrected for dust extinction , are typically factors of 10@xmath42 smaller than expected from the uv and ir sfrs .",
    "this can be reconciled by either strong differential dust attenuation ( i.e. , @xmath433  mag for the line - emitting region ) , escaping ionizing photons from matter - bounded  ii  regions , or a recently quenched starburst ( @xmath44myr ) with a small ratio of ionizing ( @xmath45   ) to non - ionizing uv photons .",

    "we highlight the interstellar medium  ii  @xmath51 absorption lines , which are used to measure outflow velocities . at low spectral resolution ( e.g. , the top right panel of figure  [ fig : spectra ] )",
    "it is not possible to determine the intrinsic shape of the absorption line profile and therefore the covering factor of the outflowing gas .",
    "however , the keck / hires spectrum of j0905 + 5759 ( @xmath52  km  s@xmath2 ) reveals that the gas covers the entire continuum source near the velocity centroid ( @xmath53  km  s@xmath2 ) indicating a galaxy - wide outflow .",
    "the compact sizes ( @xmath56  pc ) and large sfrs ( @xmath57  m@xmath4 ) for the three galaxies described above imply extremely large sfr surface densities ( @xmath3  m@xmath4  yr@xmath2  kpc@xmath5 ) . to place these galaxies in context ,",

    "for the most luminous [  iii ]  source , j1506 + 5402 , the observed @xmath68}$]/x - ray ratio implies x - ray absorption by a factor of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "however , even if the x - ray attenuation were a factor of 100 , typical for local compton - thick agns @xcite , the expected mid - ir agn contribution @xcite would still be @xmath7030% of the observed mid - ir luminosity .",

    "m@xmath4  yr@xmath2  kpc@xmath5 .",
    "we conclude that the bolometric output of the galaxies in our sample is dominated by star formation and that our results regarding large @xmath6 values are not affected by agn contamination .",
    "are the high - velocity outflows observed in these galaxies produced by a compact starburst ?",
    "@xcite argued that massive star clusters with large gas surface densities are the ideal launching point for galactic - scale outflows driven by radiation pressure , and that the outflow velocity should scale with escape velocity of the most massive star clusters in a galaxy . for our sample , if one assumes that the spatial extent of the stellar mass is comparable to that of the rest - frame @xmath72-band light ( see section  [ sec : context ] ) , then half of the stellar mass ( @xmath73  m@xmath4 ) will be within the effective radius ( @xmath74  pc ) . such a compact stellar population would have an escape velocity comparable to the @xmath1  km  s@xmath2  outflow velocities we observe : @xmath75 this argument , combined with the fact that we observe galaxies with significant dust - obscured star formation and @xmath6 values near the eddington limit , suggests that momentum input from massive stars in the form of radiation pressure is a viable mechanism for launching these outflows .",
    "in addition to radiation pressure , we also expect significant momentum flux from stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "for example , a starburst with @xmath57  m@xmath4  yr@xmath2 would have radiation pressure @xmath76  dyne and ram pressure @xmath77@xmath78  dyne from stellar winds and supernovae @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite noted that such a large momentum injection ( @xmath79  dyne ) from a small initial radius @xmath80  pc could accelerate a cloud with column density @xmath81  cm@xmath5 to a terminal velocity @xmath83  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , the energetics of compact starbursts are sufficient to produce the high - velocity outflows we observe , and it is plausible that both radiation pressure on dust grains and supernova ram pressure contribute to driving the winds .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : sigmasfr ] that the high-@xmath6 galaxies in our sample constitute a rare population , suggesting that they represent an unusual or short - lived phase .",
    "mergers of gas - rich galaxies are a viable mechanism for producing compact starbursts @xcite , and such gas - rich major mergers are rare at @xmath0 due to the decline in both the gas fraction @xcite and the fractional major merger rate @xcite of galaxies since @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , our high-@xmath6 galaxies are caught in a particular time interval where there is both vigorous star formation and strong feedback .",
    "the length of this phase may be set by the gas consumption timescale or the timescale for feedback to suppress subsequent star formation .",
    "based on the kennicutt ",
    "schmidt relation @xcite , a compact starburst with @xmath56  pc , @xmath57  m@xmath4 , and @xmath3  m@xmath4  yr@xmath2  kpc@xmath5  would have a gas surface density of @xmath85  m@xmath4  kpc@xmath5 corresponding to @xmath86  m@xmath4  inside 100  pc , which would be consumed on a timescale @xmath87  myr . this scenario could be tested with co observations of molecular gas masses and kinematics for these extreme galaxies .",
    "considering our full hst  wise sample in figure  [ fig : sigmasfr ] , we find values of @xmath6 spanning four orders of magnitude .",
    "this could be explained as an evolutionary sequence where the high-@xmath6 galaxies represent the peak of the starburst when the high - velocity outflows are launched , while the lower @xmath6 galaxies represent a subsequent , post - starburst phase .",
    "it is interesting to note that all 12/25 galaxies above the @xmath63  m@xmath4  yr@xmath2  kpc@xmath5  limit from @xcite exhibit outflows ( with median centroid velocity @xmath88  km  s@xmath2 ) , while all 7/25 galaxies without detected outflows ( the smallest black circles in figure  [ fig : sigmasfr ] ) have @xmath89  m@xmath4  yr@xmath2  kpc@xmath5 .",
    "if a compact starburst is a requirement for the production of high - velocity outflows , it may be that the sources without outflows have not gone through such a phase ( see a. robaina , et al .",
    ", in preparation for a discussion of the relationship between galaxy morphology , outflow velocity , and stellar population age in this sample ) .",
    "finally , we consider the implications of our results for models of massive galaxy formation .",
    "simulations of major galaxy mergers with large gas fractions ( @xmath90% ) can produce @xmath73  m@xmath4  remnants with @xmath91  kpc @xcite , but our sample includes galaxies of similar mass that are smaller in the rest - frame @xmath72 band by almost an order of magnitude . if the mass in these galaxies follows their @xmath72-band light , it would be extremely challenging for them to grow in size from @xmath92  kpc to @xmath93  kpc to reach the local size ",
    "mass relation @xcite in the @xmath94  gyr since @xmath95 . for comparison",
    "the compact , quiescent galaxies observed at @xmath84 @xcite have @xmath96  gyr to grow by a factor of @xmath97 . in this context , it is worth noting that the half - light radius ( ignoring dust attenuation ) at rest - frame @xmath72 band can be a factor of 510 smaller than the half - mass radius for a gas - rich merger at final coalescence near the peak of starburst activity @xcite .",
    "one could test for such size discrepancies and probe the radial dependence of the mass - to - light ratio for these galaxies by measuring sizes at rest - frame near - ir wavelengths .",
    "we have measured large sfr surface densities for galaxies that exhibit @xmath1  km  s@xmath2  outflows .",
    "the largest @xmath6 values are comparable to the eddington limit from radiation pressure on dust grains , and such compact starbursts are expected to have substantial momentum input from massive stars and supernovae .",
    "high - velocity outflows have been previously interpreted as a signpost of agn feedback , but given that feedback from a compact starburst is capable of producing such a signature and is clearly present in this sample , we conclude that the outflows we observe are likely driven by star formation .",

    "<S> we present the discovery of compact , obscured star formation in galaxies at @xmath0 that exhibit @xmath1  km  s@xmath2  outflows . using optical morphologies from the hubble space telescope and infrared photometry from the wide - field infrared survey explorer </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate star formation rate ( sfr ) surface densities that approach @xmath3  m@xmath4  yr@xmath2  kpc@xmath5 , comparable to the eddington limit from radiation pressure on dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that feedback associated with a compact starburst in the form of radiation pressure from massive stars and ram pressure from supernovae and stellar winds is sufficient to produce the high - velocity outflows we observe , without the need to invoke feedback from an active galactic nucleus . </S>"
