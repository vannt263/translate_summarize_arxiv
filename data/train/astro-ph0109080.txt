    "tolman - bondi ( tb ) model is the analytical solution of a spherically symmetric mass distribution in an expanding universe ( tolman @xcite , bondi @xcite ) .",
    "it has been succesfully applied to the virgo system by teerikorpi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and , recently , by ekholm et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for describing the peculiar velocity field and estimating the total mass of the system , even though the galaxy distribution in virgo deviates notably from spherical .",
    "motivation for the use of the tb model is that it is _ simple _ and _ analytical_. it is a first step towards approximating an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "bondi ( @xcite ) himself wrote that `` the assumption of spherical symmetry supplies us with a model which lies between the completely homogeneous models of cosmology and the actual universe with its irregularities '' .",
    "tb results are valid with appropriate smoothing ; the observed velocity field must be averaged over concentric shells around a galaxy concentration , when compared to the tb results . thus the tb model does not give the results in as much details as the various more commonly used gravitational instability  reconstruction methods . on the other hand , it does not require any assumptions for the breakdown of the theory in the non - linear region .    in order to test whether the tb model may be applied to an apparently still less favourable situation than virgo , we study the perseus - pisces supercluster , where a tb - like deviation in the hubble flow has already been observed ( theureau et al .",
    "our criterion for the success of the tb method is whether the mass inferred using tb is comparable to virial and luminosity @xmath24 @xmath12 estimate for the region , and whether the peculiar velocity field is adequately described by the model .",
    "the local @xmath25 mpc(100 km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 ) ] universe is dominated by two large mass concentrations , the great attractor and the perseus - pisces ( pp ) complexes . according to sigad",
    "( @xcite ) and dekel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) both regions have overdensities",
    "@xmath26  @xmath27 , where @xmath28/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] , @xmath29 is the local , and @xmath30 the average density . both studies used a gaussian smoothing of 12 @xmath31 mpc and assumed @xmath32 .",
    "thus the velocity field surrounding pp should reveal a strong infall towards the supercluster s center of mass . for a galaxy at around half way from pp to us",
    "the infall velocity should be @xmath33 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "however , the infall signature is difficult to reveal because of large uncertainties in redshift independent distance measurements , e.g.  those provided by tully - fisher ( tf ) or fundamental plane ( fp ) methods .",
    "uncertainties are caused by statistical biases difficult to correct for in a heterogeneous environment .",
    "additional inaccuracies are raised by the filamentary shape of the structure , consisting of an alignment of several subclusters , which complicates considerably any attempt to model the velocity field .      in the past ten years pp",
    "has been investigated by numerous authors using various distance criteria and statistical methods .",
    "the region is now well covered by great amount of data . from a large reshift sample of 3311 galaxies in the region",

    "its main ridge extends at least 50 @xmath31 mpc from pegasus eastward to the perseus cluster , with a width in the plane of the sky of about 510 @xmath31 mpc , and a typical depth in redshift of 250500 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "all the objects in the ridge are lying roughly at the same distance from us , at @xmath38 5000 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "first kinematical studies ( willick @xcite , @xcite , courteau et al .",
    "@xcite ) based on an r - band tf sample of 355 galaxies , suggested that the whole structure takes part on a large scale flow defined by the great attractor ( see e.g.  lynden - bell et al .",

    "han & mould ( @xcite ) confirmed this result independently using a whole sky tf sample of 21 clusters .",
    "hudson et al .  ( @xcite )",
    "combined their inverse fp relation measurements of seven clusters in the pp region with data of nine other clusters from the literature and concluded that the whole region has a mean cmb frame bulk motion of @xmath40 km  s@xmath15 towards galactic coordinates @xmath41 .",
    "potent reconstruction method of the density and velocity field for mark iii galaxies ( dekel et al .",
    "@xcite ) gave different results .",
    "there it was found that the center of pp is roughly at rest in the lg frame and the regions between the lg and pp are infalling towards pp .",
    "most studies of the velocity field of galaxies suggest that the kinematics of the local universe can be described by a model in which galaxies are infalling to two mass concentrations , one in pp and one in hydra - centaurus ( e.g.  han & mould @xcite , dekel et al .  @xcite ) .",

    "their studies revealed a clear infall motion towards pp , while the ga was found less dominant than originally believed .",
    "the differences in the results stated above may be caused by uncertainties in the reconstruction method , in the corrections for the selection effects , and/or in the distance indicator calibration .",
    "for example , an error in the tf zero point would cause a systematic error that resembles a hubble flow in the peculiar velocity field .",
    "dekel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) also note that the results in the pp region are more sensitive to noise than the other regions .      in a previous study using the klun galaxies , a full infall pattern , both in the front and the backside of the pp supercluster",

    "the main difficulties in velocity field studies are caused by the large uncertainties in distance determination and by the resulting biases .",
    "attempts to overcome these problems require a few things .",
    "firstly , one must know thoroughly the sample , how it was collected , and to which extent it can be assumed complete . secondly",
    ", systematic effects in the distance criterion have to be modeled , so that one can derive for a given application an unbiased set of distances .",
    "in particular , biases will be different if one estimates peculiar velocities at a given derived distance , at a given true distance , or at a given observed radial velocity .",
    "thirdly , the sample has to be deep enough and should cover a sufficiently large solid angle in the sky for the average relations , needed for the bias correction , to be free from local perturbations in the density or the velocity field .",
    "this last requirement is similar as needed for a satisfactory determination of the hubble constant .",
    "we use the klun ( kinematics of the local universe ) sample consisting of 6600 spiral galaxies having measurements of isophotal diameter @xmath51 , hi line width , radial velocity , and b - magnitude .",

    "face - on galaxies , @xmath63 , are excluded to prevent large errors on calculation of the rotational velocity parameter @xmath64 , where @xmath54 is the maximal rotational velocity of a galaxy , measured from the hi line width .",
    "absolute tf distances are obtained using the calibration given by theureau ( @xcite ) .",
    "tf scatter was there reduced by 30% by taking into account the dependence of the tf zero point on mean surface brightnesses of the galaxies .",
    "the ndm first order malmquist corrections are calculated on the basis of the whole sky sample , according to theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the sample with thus corrected tf distances , restricted to the strictly diameter complete part , contains finally 2800 spiral galaxies .",
    "the concept of normalized distances was introduced in a theoretical discussion by teerikorpi ( @xcite ) .",
    "the method was first applied by bottinelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and improved in a series of papers , most recently by theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "a theoretical description in terms of probability densities was given by theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , where the authors showed that the method can be extended to make malmquist bias corrections to galaxy distances even beyond the so - called unbiased plateau .",
    "the unbiased plateau has been profitably used for determination of the unbiased value of @xmath65 and has the advantage that one does not need model - dependent bias corrections .    in order to understand how the ndm works ,",
    "let us define classes of galaxies as follows :  objects belong to a given class if they have identical values of log rotational velocity @xmath66 , galactic extinction correction @xmath67 , inclination @xmath53 , morphological type @xmath59 and mean surface brightness @xmath68 .",
    "the main idea of the ndm is that for a given magnitude or diameter limited sample , and for a given tf scatter the behaviour of the malmquist bias as a function of true distance is similar for all galaxies belonging to the same class .",
    "the class is assumed to have a gaussian distribution of absolute magnitudes .",
    "then , for each class , there is a unique curve of evolution of the bias , which is conveniently expressed as the curve of observed average value of the hubble parameter @xmath69 vs.  distance ( @xmath42 ) , where @xmath70 is the distance given by tf relation , @xmath71 @xmath72 is the tf slope , @xmath73 the tf zero point , dependent on the surface brightness @xmath68 of the galaxy , and @xmath74 is a constant for converting the units ( linear tf - diameter in kpc and @xmath51 in @xmath75 to @xmath70 in mpc ) .",
    "essentially , the normalized distance technique means superimposing all the bias curves @xmath76 of the different classes of objects by using an appropriate scaling on the distance : @xmath77 as a result , the amplitude of the bias can be expressed merely as a function of the normalized distance ( @xmath78 ) , the apparent limit of the sample ( @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) , and the tf scatter ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : h0dn ] shows the @xmath82 vs.  @xmath78 diagram of klun galaxies in the case of the b magnitude tf relation .",
    "the unbiased part of the sample is identified as a plateau of @xmath83 constantat , at low values of @xmath78 .",
    "note , however , that for calculation of @xmath78 , one needs the true distance @xmath42 , usually derived as the so - called kinematical distance , e.g.in the case of the hubble law @xmath84 .",
    "the average bias correction is valid only if the following assumptions are fulfilled :    * _ h1 _ : the sample is complete and strictly diameter ( magnitude ) limited * _ h2 _ : tf residuals follow a gaussian distribution , and the tf scatter does not depend on the value of @xmath66 * _ h3 _ : the selection in apparent diameter ( magnitude ) is independent of the selections in redshift and @xmath66 * _ h4 _ : the radial velocity field integrated over all the directions vanishes , i.e.  except the hubble flow , there is no coherent flow at the scale of the whole sample    assumption _",
    "h1 _ is obtained by applying a strict cut - off at the completeness limit of the sample .",
    "_ h2 _ is in agreement with what is observed in the case of the b - band tf relation ( theureau et al .",
    "_ h3 _ might be difficult to prove , if observational errors on apparent magnitudes or diameters are correlated with the errors on @xmath85 :  both are linked to the inclination of the galaxy through the internal extinction correction and the de - projection of the observed hi line width .",
    "however , this effect is insignificant in the case of the diameter tf relation .",
    "as for assumption _ h4 _ , a list of recent measurements of large - scale bulk motions is given by strauss ( @xcite ) .",
    "the list is somewhat divergent ; roughly half of the surveys find no bulk flow at scales @xmath86 6000 km  s@xmath15 , the rest claim bulk flows of @xmath87@xmath88 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "we will return to the question of large - scale flow within the klun sample in the future , for now we assume that assumption _",
    "_ is true for our data .",
    "finally , the corrected distance is given by @xmath89 ( theureau et al .",
    "@xcite ) , where the ( log ) normalized distance is marked with @xmath90 , @xmath91 here @xmath92 and parameter @xmath93 defines the correction for inclination ( bottinelli et .",
    "al , @xcite ) .",
    "for a single galaxy class and usual kinematical distance , an analogous formula was derived by teerikorpi ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has also appeared in the `` triple - value correction method '' of sandage ( @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that this correction is statistical in nature .",
    "when applied to an individual galaxy , it gives an accurate _ average _ correction only if the velocity field model ( providing @xmath94 and @xmath42 ) is correct .",
    "when the velocity field is distorted , say , in the direction of a supercluster , it still gives a first order correction , but a complete correction would require an iterative procedure ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : ite ] ) .",
    "even the first order correction essentially improves the derived velocity field , as was shown by theureau et al .",

    "<S> the matter distribution around the perseus - pisces ( pp ) supercluster is studied by comparing peculiar velocities given by the kinematics of the local universe ( klun ) galaxy sample to those predicted by tolman - bondi ( tb ) models . to restrict the tb solutions we first solve the mass of the densest part of pp . </S>",

    "<S> this sphere surrounds the main part of the pp ridge and four most prominent clusters of the region . using virial - like mass estimators we calculate the cluster masses and obtain the upper and lower limits for the mass inside the @xmath2  mpc sphere : @xmath3  @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> mass to light ratios of the clusters are @xmath8 200  </S>",

    "<S> we estimate a radial density distribution around the pp core using two toy models and a smoothed density distribution observed for iras galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological density parameters @xmath13 and the pp mass are free parameters in the tb calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the klun velocities , obtained by tully - fisher relation and the normalized distance method , are adjusted by the local group ( lg ) infall velocity towards pp . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the tb velocities to klun data points indicates that the infall velocity @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 . allowing @xmath16 to vary within the limits given above we get constraints for the value of @xmath17 ; @xmath18  @xmath19 are prefered to the more extreme values , @xmath20 or @xmath21 . </S>",

    "<S> we see that the radially averaged velocity fields around simulated clusters are compatible with the corresponding tb velocities . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the applicability of the tb model around large galaxy concentrations , providing that smoothed density and radially averaged velocity fields are used . </S>"
