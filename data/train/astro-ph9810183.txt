    "metal - poor stars have atmospheres that consist of the most primitive ( luminous ) matter in the universe .",
    "they offer the possibility to study the formation and early chemical evolution of our galaxy , and the first epochs of star formation .",
    "moreover , they are of significance for observational cosmology , e.g. , by setting a lower limit to the age of the universe by their ages , and by measurement of the abundances of light element lithium , thought to have been formed in big bang nucleosynthesis .    as a result of the interference - filter / objective - prism survey of beers and collaborators ( beers et al . 1992 ; hereafter bps92 ) , the so - called `` hk survey , '' the number of known metal - deficient stars has increased dramatically in the last few years . however , as emphasized by beers ( 1999 , this volume ) , many interesting projects to be undertaken in the near future require still larger samples of _ extremely _ ( @xmath3fe / h@xmath4<-2.5 $ ] ) metal - poor stars .    given this fact , but also facing the limited availability of observing time for spectroscopic follow - up observations , we have decided to focus on a sub - sample of the metal - poor stars being present on our plates , namely the most metal - poor , unevolved stars ( main - sequence stars , turnoff - stars and subgiants ) .",
    "the restriction of the candidate set to these stars results in a tractable number of candidates per field . in section 3",
    "we show how the selection can be optimized towards this aim .    with the advent of large multi - object spectrographs ,",
    "e.g. , 6df ( watson 1998 ) , projects involving follow - up observations of a larger number of metal - poor stars should soon be feasable , such as detailed investigation of the metallicity distribution function of the galactic halo ( beers 1999 , this volume ) .",
    "the he s ( wisotzki et al .",
    "1996 ) is an objective - prism survey primarily targetted for bright qsos , covering the full southern extragalactic sky ( @xmath5  deg@xmath6 ) .",
    "it is based on iiia - j plates which have been taken with the eso schmidt telescope and its 4@xmath7 prism , yielding a wavelength range of @xmath8 and a seeing - limited spectral resolution of 15 at h@xmath9 .",
    "so far 80% of the plates have been digitised in hamburg using a pds  1010 g microdensitometer .",
    "scanning and reduction of all plates is expected to be completed by the end of 1998 .",
    "apart from the quasar survey work , this data base of digitised moderate - resolution spectra opens the possibility of a fast and efficient exploitation of the _ stellar _ content of the survey , which includes , among many other interesting classes of objects , the most metal - poor stars .    because the limiting magnitude of the he s plates ( @xmath10 ) is about one magnitude fainter than that of the hk survey ( @xmath11 ) , and a large area in the southern extragalactic sky which is not covered by the hk survey is covered by the he s ( cf .",
    "[ surveycompare ] ) , the he s has the potential for another significant increase of the number of known metal - poor stars .",
    "as a benchmark for a selection of metal - poor stars by automatic classification , a technique which is under development ( christlieb et al . 1997",
    "; 1998a , b ) , we implemented a search for spectra exhibiting a caii  k line weaker than normal for its colour .",
    "thanks to the @xmath12 photometry of the hk survey , it was possible to perform a calibration between @xmath13 and the half - power point of the density distribution of the he s spectra in the range 3900@xmath145300 ( named ` x_hpp2 ` in the following ) .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "error of the calibration is @xmath15mag , more than sufficient for this purpose .",
    "`` normal '' caii  k line strengths are defined plate - by - plate by a straight line fit of the caii  k index as a function of ` x_hpp2 ` .",
    "the fit is performed for all point - like , overlap - free sources with @xmath16 on one plate , after outliers ( e.g. , metal - poor stars , but also many plate artifacts ) have been removed by an iterative @xmath17-clipping .      in a first simulation study we investigated the composition of a sample of all objects @xmath18 below the caii",
    "k index fit . for this",
    "we used a grid of model spectra with metallicities between @xmath3fe / h@xmath4=-1.0 $ ] and @xmath19 ( tab .",
    "[ selectionfunction ] ) .",
    "the model spectra have been converted to artificial objective - prism spectra by rebinning and multiplication with spectral sensitivity curves of the he s objective - prism plates . from tab .",
    "[ selectionfunction ] one can see that above @xmath20 ( corresponding to @xmath21 , depending on plate quality ) there is a fairly sharp cutoff between @xmath3fe / h@xmath4=-1.0 $ ] and @xmath3fe / h@xmath4=-2.0 $ ] , and the simulated samples of stars with @xmath3fe / h@xmath4\\le -2.0 $ ] have a completeness close to 100% .",
    "the restriction of the sample to lower metallicities is limited by the spectral resolution of the he s objective - prism spectra : for stars in the considered temperature range , caii  k reaches the detection limit at @xmath3fe / h@xmath4\\sim -2.0 $ ] .",
