    "<S> we show the existence of stationary solutions of a 1-d gross - pitaevskii equation in presence of a multi - well external potential that do not reduce to any of the eigenfunctions of the associated schrdinger problem . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions , which in the limit of strong nonlinearity have the form of chains of dark or bright solitons located near the extrema of the potential , represent macroscopically excited states of a bose - einstein condensate and are in principle experimentally observable . </S>"
