    "drift is a phenomenon whereby fluid particles experience a net displacement after the passage of an obstacle in an unbounded domain .",
    "it has recently gained renewed attention in connection with transport and mixing in the oceans caused by swimming organisms where drift may play an important role in the overall energy transfer in the oceans @xcite .",
    "other applications involve multiphase flows @xcite and we refer the reader to our recent study @xcite for a survey of the relevant literature .",
    "as was initially introduced in the classic studies by maxwell and darwin @xcite , most investigations of drift rely on potential models of flows around a circular cylinder .",
    "the effects of wake vortices on drift were investigated in @xcite based on the potential flow models of fppl and kirchhoff .",
    "it was found that , for the fppl wake model @xcite , the effect of the wake vortices was to increase the total drift , except for very small wake sizes for which the drift was actually decreased . on the other hand , for the kirchhoff model",
    "@xcite the total drift is unbounded .",
    "information about particle displacements resulting from the passage of an obstacle , or obstacles , can be used to characterize net transport , when these displacements are integrated to produce total drift @xcite , or mixing , when the squared displacements are averaged to describe the effective diffusivity @xcite . in the present investigation",
    "we are concerned with the former quantity .",
    "a typical approach @xcite is to view the effects of multiple objects as independent of each other , which is equivalent to assuming that the drift induced by the passage of multiple objects is a simple sum of the drifts induced by the individual bodies . in other words , in this approach the geometric nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic interactions is neglected by assuming the drift to be linearly additive .",
    "the goal of this study is to address this issue in more detail by considering how the actual drift induced by the passage of multiple objects depends on their geometric configuration .    in the context of mixing , information about the displacements of individual particles",
    "was used to determine the effective diffusivity in @xcite . in particular , the study @xcite examined the effect of the passage of multiple objects in different geometric configurations .    in our study",
    "we focus on an idealized flow problem in which two identical circular cylinders pass through an unbounded extent of fluid such that their geometric configuration remains unchanged . as a results of this simplification ,",
    "there are only two parameters in the problem , namely , the distance @xmath0 between the centers of the obstacles and their inclination , measured by the angle @xmath1 , with respect to the direction of motion ( figure [ fig : setup ] ) . due to symmetry",
    ", we will only need to consider the values @xmath2 .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the resulting total drift may be increased or decreased with respect to the linearly additive case depending on the values of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the values of the drift obtained in various geometric configurations are correlated with the patterns exhibited by the particle trajectories in the different cases , thereby offering physical insights into the kinematic mechanisms underlying the increase or decrease of drift .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in the next section we define precisely drift and discuss various ways of computing it in general flows ; in section [ sec : models ] we restrict our attention to two - dimensional ( 2d ) potential flows induced by translating objects ; next , in section [ sec : numer ] we introduce and validate our numerical approach and then in section [ sec : results ] we present and discuss the computational results ; finally , conclusions are deferred to section [ sec : final ] .     in the laboratory frame of reference.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we will consider the motion of @xmath3 circular cylinders with boundaries @xmath4 , @xmath5 , passing through an incompressible inviscid fluid of unit density in a 2d unbounded domain @xmath6 . in our analysis",
    "we will use two coordinate systems : one associated with the laboratory frame of reference and the other attached to the moving obstacles ( in the latter case we will assume that the cylinder with the boundary @xmath7 has its center at the origin ) . for a point @xmath8 , the position and velocity vectors in the laboratory frame of reference will be denoted , respectively , @xmath9^t$ ] and @xmath10^t$ ] , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the @xmath13 and @xmath14 components .",
    "it is assumed that the obstacles pass from @xmath15 to @xmath16 with a constant speed and in such a way that the distance @xmath0 between the obstacle centers and the inclination angle @xmath1 remain unchanged ( figure [ fig : setup ] ) . in the moving frame of reference",
    ", we will denote the position and velocity by @xmath17^t$ ] and @xmath18^t$ ] .",
    "it is assumed that in this frame of reference the flow is steady and potential , satisfies the no through - flow boundary condition @xmath19 on each cylinder boundary @xmath4 , @xmath20 , and approaches the uniform stream at infinity @xmath21 as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the unit vector associated with the @xmath25-axis .",
    "we remark that , since the obstacles translate in the direction of the @xmath13-axis , the @xmath14 coordinates in the two coordinate systems coincide ( @xmath26 ) . while the set - up described certainly represents a highly idealized configuration ( especially the aspect concerning an infinite passage time ) , due to the geometric nonlinearity of the problem it allows us to characterize the interactions between obstacles and advected particles at a fundamental level .",
    "drift is defined in terms of the trajectories of individual particles displaced as the obstacles move through the fluid .",
    "let the initial position of the particle at @xmath27 be @xmath28 and @xmath29^t$ ] denote the corresponding particle trajectory for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "then , the drift of the particle initially at @xmath28 is defined as @xmath32 ( the symbol `` @xmath33 '' defines the quantity on the left - hand side with the quantity on the right - hand side ) . to measure the amount of fluid transport induced by the obstacles , the quantity that we are most interested in is the _ total drift area _ @xmath34 representing the integral displacement of all particles initially located on a line perpendicular to the path of the obstacles at an infinite distance upstream in the moving frame of reference , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the transverse coordinate of the particle s position when @xmath37 ( which is the same in both coordinate systems ) and @xmath38 is the streamfunction in the moving frame of reference ( with a slight abuse of notation , @xmath39 may be equivalently considered a function of @xmath28 , @xmath36 or @xmath40 ) .",
    "the two integrals in are equal , because @xmath41 as @xmath42 which is a consequence of the far - field boundary condition satisfied by the velocity field .",
    "the total drift area @xmath34 involves two nested improper integrals ( in expressions and ) and this quantity is well - defined only if the order of integration is as indicated here , i.e. , first with respect to time ( or , equivalently , the streamwise coordinate ) and then with respect to the transverse coordinate @xcite .    in general ,",
    "as outlined in @xcite , there are two effective ways to evaluate the total drift area @xmath34 numerically . in the first method , one can use a suitably transformed definition formula combined with the particle displacement given in .",
    "the second method is to evaluate the total drift area by using darwin s theorem @xcite which stipulates that @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the added mass and the fluid density is assumed equal to the unity . in the case of a single obstacle ( @xmath45 ) ,",
    "the added mass can be evaluated as follows @xcite @xmath46 where the contour @xmath47 is the boundary of the largest simply - connected region with closed streamlines .",
    "generalization of this approach to the case with multiple boundaries ( @xmath48 ) is straightforward . in the present study",
    "we will follow the first approach which was thoroughly validated in @xcite , as it has the additional advantage of providing the particle trajectories , thereby offering insights about various kinematic mechanisms at play .    from the practical point of view , the most convenient way to evaluate the improper integral is to set the initial particle positions @xmath28 at @xmath27 and then obtain the trajectories by integrating the system @xmath49 forward and backward in time , i.e. , for @xmath50 , for different @xmath28 . since in the moving frame of reference",
    "the initial particle positions in formula are given for @xmath51 , they need to be transformed to positions with finite streamwise locations in the laboratory frame , e.g. , @xmath52^t$ ] . since for a particle on a given streamline , the streamfunction @xmath53 is constant and equal to some @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 defining @xmath56 as the map between the @xmath14-coordinates of the particle at @xmath57 and at @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59 where the dot denotes differentiation , so that becomes @xmath60 the upper bound in the first integral on the right - hand side ( rhs ) in and the lower bound in the second integral are now equal to @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , because the particle on the streamline with @xmath63 has the initial coordinate @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "the reason is that the value of the streamfunction on the streamline which in the moving frame of reference coincides with the boundary @xmath7 of the first obstacle may be chosen as @xmath66 .",
    "first , in section [ sec : mult - cylinderflow ] , we will briefly review the potential flow theory for the general case of @xmath3 cylinders with arbitrary radii and positions . then , in section [ sec : two - cylinderflow ] , we will restrict this description to the case of two identical circular cylinders of unit radius ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is the case for which we will provide computational results and discussion in the remainder of the paper .",
    "hereafter , without the risk of confusion , we will interchangeably use the vector and complex notation for various vector quantities .",
    "a point @xmath17^t$ ] in the moving frame of reference will therefore also be represented as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , and the fluid velocity @xmath70^t$ ] as @xmath71 .",
    "since the velocity field is assumed incompressible and irrotational , it will be expressed in terms of the complex potential @xmath72 as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath53 are , respectively , the scalar potential and the streamfunction . since the flow models are defined in the moving frame of reference , in order to simplify the notation , we will drop the primes from the quantities defined in the complex plane .      to determine the complex potential and velocity in a flow past multiple cylinders , we apply the methods based on the schottky - klein prime function described in @xcite .",
    "they rely on the definition of suitable conformal maps .",
    "the set - up of the problem is such that , in addition to the cylinder with the boundary @xmath7 located at the origin , there are @xmath75 cylinders with centers and radii denoted @xmath76 in the @xmath77-plane and @xmath78 in the @xmath79-plane , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( it is assumed that the cylinders have no points of contact ) .",

    "the relations between the positions and radii of the remaining cylinders in the @xmath77 and @xmath79 planes are then given by    [ eq : dq ] @xmath91    next , for @xmath92 , we define the mbius maps @xmath93 where @xmath94 then , the schottky - klein prime function is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 in which the product is taken over the composition of all possible mbius maps , called the schottky group @xcite .",

    "in fact , the two approaches are equivalent , since in the case of two cylinders , the complex potential involving the schottky - klein prime function reduces to that involving elliptic functions @xcite . for two cylinders ,",
    "the simplified laurent series for the schottky - klein prime function is given in@xcite .",
    "while this is a viable approach , in the present study we choose to employ a formulation based on elliptic functions which is described below .",

    "this question is addressed in figure [ fig : minmax ] where we show the values of @xmath34 for @xmath206 in the tandem ( @xmath172 ) and transverse ( @xmath207 ) configurations ( numerical evaluation of the drift when @xmath208 , i.e. , when the two cylinder touch , is not possible due to a singularity of the potential flow formulation , cf .",

    "we see that the largest and smallest drift values are , respectively , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , and are attained when the two cylinders touch in the transverse and tandem configurations .",
    "the increase of the drift in the former case can be understood as being due to the two cylinders creating a `` cavity '' in front of them which traps particles as the cylinders advance . on the other hand , in the tandem configuration the front stagnation point of the rear cylinder",
    "is shielded by the first cylinder which reduces the trapping effect .     as a function of the separation @xmath0 between the cylinders in the tandem ( @xmath211 ) and transverse ( @xmath207 ) configurations.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "in this study we have focused on the drift induced by the passage of two circular cylinders in an unbounded incompressible fluid under the assumptions that the flow is potential and stationary in the moving frame of reference . knowing that when the two cylinders are separated by an infinite distance , the total drift area is equal to twice the drift induced by one cylinder , the goal was to analyze how the geometric configuration of the cylinders , namely , their separation and inclination with respect to the translation direction , affect the total drift . for each considered configuration ,",
    "the problem was studied by integrating particle trajectories numerically with high precision for a range of different initial particle positions . the velocity field induced by the two cylinders during their passage",
    "was expressed in closed form in terms of special functions using methods of the complex function theory ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the computation of drift based on darwin s theorem , the present approach provides additional information about the shapes of the particle trajectories which sheds light on the kinematic mechanisms responsible for the increase or decrease of the total drift area in comparison with the reference case when the two cylinders are infinitely separated .    while the set - up of our problem is admittedly highly idealized , where we assume an infinite passage time and time - invariance of the geometric configuration , this problem nonetheless offers some fundamental insights into the relation between the flow geometry and drift .",
    "we emphasize here that , although the equations governing potential flows are linear in the flow variables , they exhibit a _ nonlinear _ dependence on the geometry of the flow domain .",
    "this nonlinearity is manifested in the results reported in section [ sec : results ] , which demonstrate that the drift induced by individual obstacles may not be simply added to produce the total drift .",
    "more specifically , we showed that for small inclination angles @xmath1 , resulting in more `` streamlined '' cylinder arrangements , the total drift area is decreased in comparison with the reference case , and is increased in configurations characterized by the inclination angle @xmath1 larger than @xmath212 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : dmap ] ) .",
    "we also determined the extreme values attained by the total drift area @xmath34 which correspond to the vanishing separations between the two cylinders in the tandem and transverse configurations ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : minmax ] ) .",
    "we observe interesting analogies between these findings and the results reported in @xcite where the authors studied the influence of the geometric configuration on the effective diffusivity .",
    "it appears that both the total drift and the effective diffusivity attain their maxima and minima for vanishing separations between the obstacles and for inclination angles , respectively , @xmath213 and @xmath172 .",
    "remarkably , the relative changes of the total drift and of the effective diffusivity with respect their values in the non - interacting cases were found to be very similar  they are given by the factors of approximately 2.2 and 0.6 for @xmath207 and @xmath172 .",
    "on the other hand , unlike the total drift area , the effective diffusivity seems to converge to twice its value in the non - interacting case as the separation distance @xmath0 increases only for certain inclination angles @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "as regards the particle trajectories obtained in the different configurations , we observed that high - drift cases lead to trajectories with a single loop ( cf .  figure [ fig : traj]a ) , whereas in the low - drift configurations particle trajectories starting at certain initial locations may actually exhibit two loops ( cf .  figures [ fig : traj]b , c ) .",
    "these observed trajectories qualitatively match those reported in @xcite .",
