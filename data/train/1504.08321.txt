    "free ] we characterize free valuation congruence with help of _ evaluation trees _ : given a conditional statement , its evaluation tree directly represents all its evaluations ( in the way a truth table does in the case of propositional logic ) .",

    "the structure of our proofs on the axiomatizations of the other valuation congruences that we consider is very similar , although the case for static valuation congruence requires a slightly more complex proof ( below we return to this point ) .",
    "moreover , these axiomatizations are incremental : the axiom systems @xmath173 up to and including @xmath540 all share the axioms of @xmath13 , and each succeeding system is defined by the addition of either one or two axioms , in most cases making previously added axiom(s ) redundant . given some @xmath562 , this implies that in @xmath615 , @xmath648 where all these inclusions are proper if @xmath649 , and thus @xmath650 , and thus @xmath651 . we conclude that repetition - proof evaluation trees and the valuation congruence @xmath297 provide a full - fledged , simple and elegant semantics for @xmath173 , and that this is also the case for contractive evaluation trees and the valuation congruence @xmath396 , and memorizing evaluation trees and the valuation congruence @xmath526 .",

    "it is cumbersome , but not difficult to prove that given some @xmath562 , the function @xmath620 is a normalization function on @xmath615 .",
    "in addition to lemma  [ la:6.7 ] this requires proving that for each st - basic form @xmath1 over @xmath78 , @xmath659 .",

    "familiar binary connectives that occur in the context of imperative programming and that prescribe short - circuit evaluation , such as ` & & ` ( in c called `` logical and '' ) , are often defined in the following way : @xmath660 independent of the precise syntax of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , hence , @xmath661 . in a similarly way , negation can be defined by @xmath662 .",
    "short - circuit logic focuses on the question @xmath663 a first approach to this question is to adopt the conditional as an auxiliary operator , as is done in  @xcite , and to answer question   using definitions of the binary propositional connectives as above and the axiomatization for the valuation congruence of interest in proposition algebra ( or , if `` mixed conditional statements '' are at stake , axiomatizations for the appropriate valuations congruences ) .",
    "an alternative and more direct approach to question   is to establish axiomatizations for short - circuited binary connectives in which the conditional is _ not _ used . for free valuation congruence , an equational axiomatization of short - circuited binary propositional connectives is provided by staudt in  @xcite , where @xmath664 $ ] and @xmath665 $ ] ( and @xmath51 is also defined for short - circuited disjunction ) , and the associated completeness proof is based on decomposition properties of such evaluation trees . for repetition - proof valuation congruence it is an open question whether a finite , equational axiomatization of the short - circuited binary propositional connectives exists , and an investigation of repetition - proof evaluation trees defined by such connectives might be of interest in this respect .",

    "assume that ` ( e==e ' ) ` evaluates to @xmath10  if @xmath668 and @xmath669 represent the same value , and ` ( n = e ) ` always evaluates to _ true _ with the effect that @xmath668 s value is assigned to @xmath666 .",
