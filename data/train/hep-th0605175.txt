    "there is great interest in understanding the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "there are various regions of the @xmath2 phase diagram ( @xmath3 is temperature and @xmath4 is a chemical potential for baryon number ) which are extremely hard to model theoretically using traditional field theory techniques .",
    "some of these regimes are being probed experimentally , and so there is additional interest in obtaining better theoretical understanding from an immediate phenomenological point of view .    for almost a decade , progress in understanding the dynamics of extended objects in string theory has enabled several new techniques  and a fresh and powerful new perspective  to be brought to the study of strongly coupled gauge theory .",
    "the techniques were sharpened further ( for large number of colours , @xmath1 , ) with holographic examples such as the ads / cft correspondence , and the study of gauge / gravity duals ( or , more properly , gauge / string duals ) has proven to be a fruitful and often elegant pursuit .",
    "not long after the birth of ads / cft@xcite , where the finite temperature phase structure of @xmath5 @xmath0 ( at large @xmath1 ) was understood in terms of the thermodynamics of schwarzschild black holes in ads@xcite , it was recognized@xcite that progress could be made in understading the properties of gauge theories in the presence of a global current , akin to a chemical potential for baryon number or isospin , by studying the physics of charged black holes , such as riessner ",
    "nordstrom@xcite , or more general charged black holes with non ",
    "trivial scalars@xcite , in ads .    the resulting @xmath6 or @xmath7 phase diagrams ( where @xmath8 is conjugate to @xmath9the analogue of baryon number ) of the @xmath5 guage theory were found to be rather rich , with _",
    "e.g. , _ a first order phase transition line , and even a second order critical point in the @xmath7 plane@xcite .",
    "this led to the hope that such studies might lead to insights into the physics of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the idea is that studies of the effect of the global @xmath10 symmetry  even though it is not exactly baryon number  might lead to physics in the same universality class as the more realistic gauge theories , giving insight into qcd at finite temperature and density .",
    "a more firm footing for this idea should be obtained by the study of those dynamics in the presence of fundamental flavours of quark , a key feature of qcd that distinguishes it from the @xmath5 gauge theory ( which of course only has adjoint matter of very specific types and quantities allowed by supersymmetry ) . while it is notoriously difficult to study this problem as a string dual so far it is known@xcite how to place fundamental flavours into the theory , in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "this is a sort of `` quenched '' limit where the quarks feel the gauge dynamics but whose presence does not effect the physics ( _ i.e. , _ the quarks do not back  react ) .",
    "while this limit can not capture a great deal of detailed qcd physics , it is hoped that it may well provide valuable clues in the study of the phase structure and will certainly be an instructive step along the path to fully understanding the case of fully interacting dynamical quarks .",
    "the global symmetries in question in the case of the @xmath5 theory live in the @xmath12 subgroup of the large @xmath13 r  symmetry enjoyed by the theory . in the string",
    "dual this corresponds to that fact that the d3branes ( on whose worldvolume the gauge theory resides ) have an @xmath14 transverse to them , in the decoupling limit that gives the ads / cft duality , they correspond to a subset of the @xmath15 isometries of the explicit @xmath16 of the ads@xmath17 spacetime where the dual string theory propagates .",
    "fundamental dynamical quarks enter the story as d7brane probes of the geometry . the @xmath5 supersymmetry is now replaced by @xmath18 and the quarks lie in hypermultiplets .",
    "the @xmath14 now breaks into an @xmath19 transverse to both the d3branes and the d7branes , and an @xmath20 transverse to the d3branes , but internal to the d7branes .    in the probe limit in question , the quarks are the ends of the strings stretching from the d7branes to the d3branes , their masses being set by the distance between the two sets of branes in the @xmath19 . in the decoupling limit ( where the @xmath1 d  branes have been replaced by ads@xmath17 geometry ) , the location in the plane transverse to the d7brane controls the quark mass and a condensate of quarks , according to@xcite : @xmath21",
    "where @xmath22 ( the bare quark mass ) and @xmath23 ( the quark condensate ) , @xmath24 is a radial coordinate in the decoupling limit , and @xmath25 in this paper .",
    "the condensate actually breaks the @xmath10 symmetry corresponding to rotations in the @xmath19 , that acts chirally on the @xmath26 fields .",
    "we explored the allowed values of the condensate @xmath27 as a function of quark mass @xmath28 at finite temperature @xmath3 ( where supersymmetry is broken ) , and with the system charged an amount @xmath8 under a global @xmath10 current .",
    "we did two cases .",
    "the first is the chiral current associated with rotations transverse to the d7branes , and the second is a @xmath10 that mixes transverse and parallel rotations .",
    "we found a rich structure , upon which we will report in this paper .",
    "we found that there are generalizations of the first order phase transition already observed ( and extensively studied , see refs.@xcite ) at @xmath29 for this case .",
    "in addition , we found that at finite @xmath8 a new phase appears where there is a non  zero condensate at zero quark mass @xmath28 .",
    "this is an example of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the presence of an analogue of finite fixed baryon number or isospin charge .",
    "we study the meson spectrum of our model and identify the massless `` pions '' ( it is really a slight misnomer  see ref.@xcite ) which play the role of the goldstone bosons of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we study the behaviour of the pion mass as a function of quark mass @xmath28 and find that it obeys the gell - mann  oakes ",
    "renner relation@xcite .",
    "crucially , we also verify that away from the range of @xmath8 where the symmetry breaking is present , the meson has no massless particle at @xmath30 , confirming our identification .",
    "to source subgroups of the @xmath31 global symmetries corresponding to rotations in the transverse @xmath14 , we consider d3branes with angular momentum .",
    "the supergravity description / metric for spinning d3branes is@xcite : @xmath32 where : @xmath33 in order to explore the decoupling limit ( @xmath34 ) , which we are interested in , we define : @xmath35 such that : @xmath36 with these definitions , in the decoupling limit , the metric is : @xmath37 where we have defined : @xmath38 there are two different cases that we consider :    1 .   a single charge in the @xmath39 direction : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this case is a useful test case since it is the simplest problem to explore and provides valuable insight into the next , more complicated case .",
    "2 .   three equal charges : @xmath42 .",
    "this case is of greater interest since the supergravity metric , upon compactification , corresponds to the ads ",
    "reissner  nordstrom black hole@xcite ( the previous case gives charged black holes with an extra scalar field excited@xcite ) .",
    "for the single charge case , we choose @xmath40 and @xmath41 in equation  ( [ eqt : decoupled spinning brane metric ] ) , and the metric becomes : @xmath43 where @xmath44 although there is a change of variables that allows us to rewrite this metric in a more conventional form , it will be computationally convenient to work with the metric in equation  ( [ eqt : single charge metric ] ) . in order to introduce dynamical quarks into our gauge theory ,",
    "we probe the geometry with d7branes  @xcite .",
    "we choose the coordinates @xmath45 to be the transverse coordinates to the d7brane .",
    "however , we will define radial coordinates in the @xmath46subspace transverse to the d3 branes via : @xmath47 although these radial coordinates are not transverse to each other , the non - zero @xmath48 component of the metric vanishes at the asymptotic boundary .",
    "therefore , by expanding : @xmath49 we can still make sense of the coefficient @xmath28 as being the asymptotic separation of the d3 and d7 branes .",
    "this will allow us to extract the bare quark mass and the condensate value .",
    "it should be noted however that , unlike the zero charge case considered in refs.@xcite , we can not directly identify the coefficient @xmath50 with the quark condensate . the correct identification can be made after an appropriate change of variables that restores the @xmath16 symmetry of the geometry at the asymptotic boundary .",
    "we will explicitly show this later .",
    "we choose an ansatz @xmath51 and @xmath52 . with these choices ,",
    "the worldvolume of the d7brane is given by : @xmath53 from here , we see that the worldvolume goes to zero for two particular cases :    1 .",
    "this case is akin to the karch - katz like solutions described in ref.@xcite .",
    "2 .   @xmath55 .",
    "this is akin to the condensate solutions described in ref.@xcite .",
    "note the absolute value sign in ( [ eqt : single charge worldvolume ] ) .",
    "this means that although the world  volume goes to zero at this point , the d7brane does not actually end there .",
    "the vanishing is a result of the coordinates we are using ; the d7brane continues through and terminates on the event horizon defined by @xmath56 .",
    "we are only interested in d7brane embeddings that are smooth ( no kinks ) across this locus , as they correspond to the lowest energy solutions .",
    "this condition of smoothness , which has only been checked numerically , is only satisfied for a particular boundary condition for our scalar fields on this locus , which we describe below .",
    "we solve the equation of motion for @xmath57 numerically using a shooting technique .",
    "we use  @xmath58  @xmath59  @xmath60 and @xmath61 throughout our numerical calculations .",
    "such a choice corresponds to measuring distances in units of the ads radius and to fixing the mass of the black hole , respecively .",
    "it has become customary in the field @xcite to shoot from the event horizon towards infinity .",
    "using ir boundary conditions for the uncharged case has meant that the correct uv boundary values are achieved automatically , and the bare quark mass and condensate are extracted in this way . for the charged case , because the ergosphere and the event horizon do not coincide , this introduces a new complication . for @xmath62 , near the event horizon , the equation of motion for the embedding resembles : @xmath63 where @xmath64 are functions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 . since @xmath67 at the event horizon , we use equation  ( [ eqt : eom near horizon ] ) to obtain the necessary boundary condition , which is depicted in figure  [ fig : bc eh ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    however , if we use this boundary condition to shoot to infinity , we find that @xmath68 diverges at the locus of points where the worldvolume vanishes . at first glance",
    ", this may not be a problem , since it is a necessary condition if we wish to have a regular , non  zero worldvolume across the locus .",
    "however , in this case , the worldvolume diverges at the pseudo - horizon .",
    "this results in the d7brane embedding to curve back on itself , as shown in figure  [ fig : curve back ] .",
    "we argue that these solutions do not correspond to physical d7brane embeddings , and , therefore , the boundary conditions specified at the event horizon are not the ones we are interested in .",
    "we get similar results if we try to force the worldvolume to be regular and non  zero across the same locus of points .    )",
    "results in embeddings curving back .",

    "the ( blue ) curve in between is the embedding solution.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    therefore , we impose a new `` physical '' condition on our embeddings ; we want @xmath68 to be at least continuously differentiable across the locus of vanishing worldvolume . in order to figure out the appropriate boundary conditions at this locus of points , we study the equation of motion near the locus : @xmath69 where @xmath70 depends on @xmath71 and @xmath66 , and @xmath72 is a strictly positive function of @xmath73 . since @xmath74 at the locus of vanishing worldvolume",
    ", we use this equation to obtain the necessary boundary condition , which is depicted in figure  [ fig : bc ph ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    therefore , for @xmath75 , we shoot from the locus described in point 2 above  which is not where the d7brane ends , in knowledge that we are able to `` sew '' the rest of the d7brane that ends on the event horizon .",
    "two examples of this sewing process are shown in figure  [ fig : sew ] to illustrate that it can be done , and we refrain from plotting the sewed solutions on future plots .",
    "we use the boundary conditions depicted in figure  [ fig : bc ph ] .    for @xmath54",
    ", this corresponds to shooting from the location described in point 1 above , where the d7brane has ended .",
    "the boundary condition is given by : @xmath76 these boundary conditions were also used in reference @xcite ; it is a result of requiring the absence of conifold singularities as the @xmath77 that the d7brane wraps shrinks to zero size .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : single charge l vs rho ] shows examples of the condensate and karch  katz - like solutions as they approach their respective end points .",
    "it is important to notice that in figure  [ fig : linear c vs m ] , the karch  katz - like solutions have a slope of @xmath78 for large @xmath28 , so this choice of the constant @xmath50 is not proportional to the condensate , as we remarked earlier .",
    "this is a result of our choice of coordinates in the expansion of @xmath79 as given in equation  ( [ eqt : l expansion ] ) , for which : @xmath80    in order to see this , we recall that for the zero charge case ( _ i.e. , _ the ads schwarzschild black hole studied in ref.@xcite ) , as @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 ; the constant @xmath50 is proportional to the quark condensate as shown by ref.@xcite .",
    "the key geometric difference between the charged and uncharged case is that the @xmath83 gets distorted due to the presence of the charge @xmath8 . in order to be able to identify the condensate",
    ", we want to restore the symmetry of the @xmath83 as much as possible as we move away from the horizon .    by looking at the distorted @xmath83 part in equation  ( [ eqt : decoupled spinning brane metric ] ) , one can see that , as we start moving away from the horizon ( i.e. when we see the effect of @xmath84 less and less ) , it starts conformally looking like : @xmath85 where @xmath86 following ref.@xcite , the change of variables that would restore the symmetry is given by : @xmath87 in view of this , for the single charge case , one defines the following radial coordinate : @xmath88 this allows us to rewrite : @xmath89 we can now define new coordinates : @xmath90 so that we have : @xmath91 then from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath92 for large @xmath24 : @xmath93 we can argue that @xmath94 has the expansion : @xmath95 using the standard argument from ref.@xcite we can show that : @xmath96 so , in these coordinates that restore the symmetry of the @xmath83 , the nave condensate value gets a constant subtraction .",
    "henceforth , all future plots of @xmath27 will subtract off this term . the adjusted solution and the phase transition region",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : more single charge solutions ] .",
    "there are several important things to notice .",
    "first , in figure  [ fig : single charge c vs m ] , unlike the ads schwarzschild case , we begin to see the condensate becoming negative for small bare quark mass .",
    "in addition , we see the appearance of _ apparently _ negative masses ( see figure  [ fig : single charge origin ] ) .",
    "this of course corresponds to negative @xmath97 value for @xmath98 .",
    "this effect is to be interpreted as the constant coordinate @xmath39 flipping to @xmath99 .",
    "this has been checked by extending @xmath57 to negative values and observing that we get the same physics , continued to the negative mass side .",
    "this is simply the familiar case of realizing that a negative radial coordinate should be flipped back to positive values after taking into account the range of the angular coordinates . here",
    ", by considering the fixed  @xmath39 ansatz , we are required to extend the definition of @xmath57 to negative values . therefore , these solutions would have physical values given by @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we see the appearance of a finite condensate gap between the @xmath102 solution and the @xmath103 .",
    "our equal area law , discussed in ref.@xcite , tells us that the lower branch , corresponding to negative values of the condensate , has the lowest energy .",
    "therefore , the system chooses the @xmath103 solution .",
    "this means that the geometry breaks @xmath10 chiral symmetry spontaneously .",
    "we plot the value of the condensate at zero bare quark mass in figure  [ fig : single charge critical condensate vs q ] .",
    "we see that there is a minimum amount of charge that is needed before chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "we also notice that the condensate decreases toward zero asymptotically as @xmath104 .",
    "when we set all three charges to be equal@xcite , ( _ i.e. , _ @xmath105 in equation  ( [ eqt : decoupled spinning brane metric ] ) ) , the metric is given by : @xmath106 where @xmath107 from a computational point of view , it is again more convenient to use @xmath108 however , just like in the single charge case of last section , the karch  katz  like solutions exhibit a positive slope of @xmath78 for the condensate , which is again an artifact of the coordinates . to show that , we introduce a new radial coordinate @xmath109 satisfying : @xmath110 and the corresponding radial coordinates are : @xmath111 using that @xmath109 from equation  ( [ eqn2 ] ) has the asymptotic behavior",
    ": @xmath112 one can show that : @xmath113 note also that one can write : @xmath114 and following the standard argument presented in ref.@xcite one can show that : @xmath96 therefore , to explore the functional dependence of the condensate on the bare quark mass , we again choose @xmath115 and @xmath39 to be our transverse coordinates to the d7brane . with this choice , the worldvolume of the d7brane is given by : @xmath116 we see that when @xmath117 , the worldvolume goes to zero .",
    "this corresponds to the karch  katz  like solutions that we saw for the ads schwarzschild black hole and our single charge case .",
    "the other case where the worldvolume goes to zero is when : @xmath118 this is a similar situation as for the single charge case , where the worldvolume goes to zero , but the d7brane continues through and ends only at the event horizon determined by @xmath119",
    ". we can solve the equation of motion for @xmath57 numerically ( using @xmath120 ) using the same boundary conditions as in equation  ( [ eqt : bc ] ) for the karch - katz  like solutions and the curve in figure  [ fig : bc ph2 ] for @xmath62 , and we illustrate the two types of solutions in figure  [ fig : three charge simple example ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we see exactly the same behavior as in the single charge ; for large @xmath28 , the slope of the @xmath27  vs.  @xmath28 plot , ( figure  [ fig : three charge c vs m ] ) is given by @xmath121 , as can be expected from the arguments presented above .",
    "therefore , as in the single charge case we will henceforth subtract this @xmath121 contribution from all future @xmath27 values displayed in our figures .",
    "figure  [ fig : three charge many solutions part 2 ] shows solutions for a variety of charges .",
    "we can determine where the phase transition between condensate and karch  katz  like occurs from the equal - area law that we determined in ref.@xcite .",
    "this allows us to avoid calculating the energy of the d7brane .",
    "we again notice that , beyond a critical value of @xmath8 , we begin to see solutions with negative condensate value ( see figure  [ fig : q=0.6 c vs m ] ) ; we saw this feature in the single charge case as well .",
    "notice also that we again see the appearance of solutions with _ apparently _ negative bare quark mass ; this of course corresponds to negative @xmath97 value for @xmath98 , an effect seen in figure  [ fig : three charge c vs m ] and can be explained as before . for those values ,",
    "one simply swops @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , we see the appearance of a discrete condensate gap between the @xmath102 solution and the @xmath103 . using our equal area law ,",
    "it would tell us that the lower branch , corresponding to negative values of the condensate , has the lowest energy .",
    "this means that our gauge theory will choose to have a non - zero condensate at zero bare quark mass .",
    "this means the geometry breaks @xmath10 chiral symmetry spontaneously . as @xmath8 approaches its maximum value ( @xmath123 )",
    "after which there is no event horizon , we begin seeing a multiplicity of condensate solutions for small bare quark mass , resulting from the rather beautiful spiral of solutions ( see the first quadrant in figures [ fig : q=0.6 c vs m origin ] and [ fig : q=0.62 c vs m origin ]",
    ". using our equal area law again , we learn that the lowest branch of the spiral , corresponding to negative values of the condensate , has the lowest energy , and as we go `` deeper '' into the spiral every successive branch has higher energy ; the other zero  mass condensates are simply metastable states .",
    "therefore , again at zero bare quark mass , we have a non - zero negative condensate value and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we plot the condensate value for zero bare quark mass as a function of the charge @xmath8 in figure  [ fig : three charge critical condensate vs q ] .",
    "we see again that there is a minimum @xmath8 below which chiral",
    "symmetry is unbroken .",
    "in order to confirm that we are indeed seeing chiral symmetry breaking , we calculate the quadratic fluctuations in the transverse coordinate @xmath39 about the embedding solutions for @xmath66 we found earlier . in the gauge theory",
    ", this will correspond to a pseudo - scalar meson , as described in ref.@xcite . as a reminder , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exact meson spectrum for the ads@xmath124 background was found to be given by : @xmath125 where @xmath126 labels the order of the spherical harmonic expansion , and @xmath127 is a positive integer that represents the order of the mode . in our meson spectrum calculations ,",
    "we have only considered the @xmath128 solutions for the fluctuations in @xmath57 and @xmath129 .",
    "we will choose an ansatz of the form : @xmath130 where @xmath131=m$ ] corresponds to the meson s 4dimensional mass and @xmath132 $ ] corresponds to the inverse of the meson s lifetime .",
    "we then recalculate the dbi action of the d7brane probe and expand the action to second order in @xmath133 .",
    "the classical equations of motion for the fluctuation can then be derived using the euler  lagrange equation .",
    "the first thing we find is that near the event horizon , the equation of motion does not have the form of a heun equation ; this means that we do not have quasi ",
    "normal modes at the event horizon .",
    "this means that the condensate embeddings and the mesons associated with their fluctuations are stable .",
    "this is the opposite of what has been found for the ads schwarzschild black hole background @xcite .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider the real part of @xmath134 in our analysis . in order to solve for the mass of the meson",
    ", we again solve our equation of motion by shooting from where the worldvolume is zero towards infinity .",
    "our boundary conditions for the condensate embeddings is determined by the equation of motion , as before to require that the function @xmath133 is smooth across the vanishing worldvolume locus .",
