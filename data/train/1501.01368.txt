    "the creation of smale s horseshoes has been one of the most fundamental subjects in the study of dynamical systems for several decades .",
    "since horseshoes are known to be the key to understand the nature of chaotic dynamics , it is natural to ask how they are created in the bifurcation procedures . among several aspects of the creation of horseshoes , we focus on the last bifurcation problem , which asks when and how the creation of horseshoes is completed .",
    "equivalently , the problem is to investigate the topological and geometric structure of the the locus in the parameter space where the maps exhibit horseshoes , and to determine the dynamics of the maps from its boundary .",
    "this article is devoted to the problem with respect to the celebrated _ hnon family _",
    "@xcite : @xmath3 defined on @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is the parameter . by restricting ourselves to this very concrete but fundamental dynamical system",
    ", we are able to obtain an almost complete answer to the problem above . an interesting feature of our argument in this paper is that , although the results we have obtained concern the dynamics of hnon maps on the _ real _ plane , their proofs require _ complex _ methods from complex dynamics and complex analytic geometry in an essential way as we shall see below .      let us begin by recalling some known facts on the hnon family .",
    "when @xmath5 is fixed and @xmath6 is large enough , @xmath7 is a _ hyperbolic horseshoe _ on @xmath0 , i.e. the restriction of @xmath7 to its non - wandering set is uniformly hyperbolic and is topologically conjugate to the full shift with two symbols  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the topological entropy of @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 for any @xmath9  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath7 is a hyperbolic horseshoe on @xmath0 , it attains the _ maximal entropy _ among hnon maps ,",
    "i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "we are thus led to introduce the _ hyperbolic horseshoe locus _ : @xmath11 as well as the _ maximal entropy locus _ : @xmath12 note that @xmath13 is open and @xmath14 is closed in @xmath15 ( since @xmath16 is a continuous function of @xmath17 ; see  @xcite ) , hence @xmath18 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to characterize these two loci .",
    "* main theorem . *    our results",
    "were numerically observed at the beginning of 1980 s by el hamouly and mira , tresser , ushiki and others as shown in figure  [ fig : mira ] which is obtained by joining two figures in  @xcite ( note that the sign of our parameter @xmath19 is opposite to the one in figure  [ fig : mira ] ) .",
    "there , the graph of @xmath20 is implicitly figured out by the right - most wedge - shaped curve .",
    "we note that for the case @xmath21 , the claim of main theorem has been first proved by bedford and smillie  @xcite . to extend their result to all values of @xmath19",
    ", we need to introduce new topological ideas and elaborate rigorous numerical tools .",
    "this enables us to prove some global properties of the two loci . to state them",
    "let us add to @xmath13 and @xmath14 their corresponding loci of the quadratic family @xmath22 , i.e. let us put @xmath23 and @xmath24 as a consequence of main theorem , we obtain    * main corollary .",
    "* _ both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are connected and simply connected , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . _    as far as we know , this is the first result concerning the global topology of parameter loci for the real hnon family .",
    "[ fig : chart ]      let us discuss some open questions and remarks related to our results .",
    "first of all , as clearly seen in figure  [ fig : mira ] , the function @xmath20 looks monotone both on @xmath29 and on @xmath30",
    ". it would be interesting to give a rigorous proof of this observation .    on the contrary ,",
    "the claims of our results are not as obvious as observed in figure  [ fig : mira ] . to see this ,",
    "let us briefly recall the _ anti - monotonicity theorem _ in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) be a one - parameter family of dissipative @xmath33-diffeomorphisms of the plane and assume that @xmath34 has a non - degenerate homoclinic tangency for certain @xmath35 .",
    "then , there are both infinitely many orbit - creation and infinitely many orbit - annihilation parameters in any neighborhood of @xmath36 .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that for the one - parameter family of hnon maps @xmath37 with a fixed @xmath38 sufficiently close to zero , the map at @xmath39 taken from the boundary @xmath40 has a non - degenerate homoclinic tangency .",
    "of course , anti - monotonicity of some orbits does not necessarily imply anti - monotonicity of topological entropy .",
    "nonetheless , this theorem suggests that , a priori , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 could have several connected components separated from the largest one described in main corollary .",
    "one may ask if an analogy of main corollary holds for the _ complex _ hnon family @xmath41 . to be more precise ,",
    "let us define the _ complex hyperbolic horseshoe locus _",
    "@xmath42 as the set of parameters @xmath43 for which the restriction of @xmath7 to its julia set is uniformly hyperbolic and is topologically conjugate to the full shift with two symbols .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath42 is not simply connected by considering the monodromy representation of the fundamental group of @xmath42 to the shift automorphism group ( indeed , its image contains an element of infinite order  @xcite ) .",
    "it is however still an open question if @xmath42 is connected . on the other hand ,",
    "the topological entropy of a complex hnon map is @xmath44 and does not depend on the choice of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , there is no analogous locus to @xmath14 in the complex case .",
    "it is interesting to compare the above results with the case of a piecewise affine model called the _",
    "lozi family _",
    "@xmath46 . in",
    "@xcite it has been proved that both the hyperbolic horseshoe locus and the maximal entropy locus for the lozi family are characterized by an _ algebraic _ function , similar to main theorem . as a consequence , we have shown that exactly the same statement of main corollary holds for the lozi family by adding the corresponding loci for the tent - map family @xmath47 .",
    "we also stated in  @xcite the conjecture that the boundary of the _ zero - entropy locus _ for the lozi family is piecewise algebraic with countably many algebraic pieces for @xmath48 ( compare  @xcite ) and proposed a strategy of its proof .",
    "it is hence natural to conjecture that the boundary of the zero - entropy locus for the hnon family is piecewise real analytic ( see also page 19 of  @xcite ) .",
    "this conjecture has been solved for @xmath19 close to zero in theorem 2.2 of  @xcite ( see also corollary 4.5 of  @xcite ) .      to conclude the introduction we mention some comments on the proof of main theorem .",
    "the basic strategy of our proof is to extend the dynamical space as well as the parameter space over @xmath1 and investigate their complex dynamical and complex analytic properties as in  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some new ingredients in our proof .",
    "below we discuss an outline of the proof with an emphasis on the new ingredients .",
    "figure  [ fig : chart ] is a flowchart describing the implications between principal statements in this article .",
    "the starting point of our discussion is to classify any hnon map into the following three types ( theorem  [ quasitrichotomy ] ) ; either ( i ) @xmath49 , ( ii ) @xmath7 is a hyperbolic horseshoe on @xmath0 , or ( iii ) @xmath7 satisfies the _ crossed mapping condition _ ( definition  [ 2.3 ] ) with respect to a family of projective bidisks @xmath50 for @xmath17 in a complex neighborhood of @xmath40 . thanks to this classification we can focus on the case ( iii ) .",
    "the family of boxes allows us to partition the complex stable / unstable manifolds of @xmath7 into several pieces in terms of symbolic dynamics . by restricting the stable / unstable manifolds to @xmath0 , certain plane topology argument together with the crossed mapping condition",
    "implies that these pieces are nicely configured in the boxes ( propositions  [ 4.8 ] and  [ 4.11 ] ) .",
    "this enables us to detect which special pieces are responsible for the locus @xmath14 ( theorems  [ maximalentropy ] ) as well as the locus @xmath13 ( theorem  [ hyperbolichorseshoe ] ) .",
    "we are thus led to define the complex tangency loci @xmath51 to be the complex parameters for which the corresponding complex special pieces have tangencies ( definition  [ 5.3 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath51 form complex subvarieties  @xcite , our problem is to wipe out their possible singularities . for this",
    ", we first verify the `` tin can '' condition ( theorem  [ tincan ] ) to prove that the projection from @xmath51 to the @xmath19-axis is a proper map .",
    "the transversality of the quadratic family @xmath22 at @xmath52 yields that its degree is one .",
    "therefore , it follows that @xmath51 are complex submanifolds ( proposition  [ 5.9 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to define the real analytic function @xmath20 so that its graph coincides with the real part of @xmath51 ( propositions  [ 5.10 ] and  [ 5.11 ] ) , which finishes the proof .",
    "the first significant ingredient in our proof is a new constriction of projective bidisks @xmath50 in theorem  [ quasitrichotomy ] . in  @xcite , bedford and smillie",
    "have constructed a family of three bidisks in @xmath53 called _ boxes _ based on the puzzle pieces for the chebyshev polynomial @xmath54 which lies on the degenerated limit @xmath55 along @xmath56 .",
    "it turns out that this family of boxes satisfies the crossed mapping condition only when @xmath57 ( see appendix  [ appendixc ] ) .",
    "therefore , we introduce a new family of `` non - perturbative '' boxes with respect to certain projective coordinates based on the trellis formed by invariant manifolds in @xmath0 . this enables us to verify the necessary criteria for _ all _ values of @xmath19 , which is the basis of our discussion .",
    "however , there are two trade - offs of this new choice ; one is that the new boxes can not be computed algebraically in terms of the parameter and another is that the combinatorics of the transitions between the new boxes is more complicated than in  @xcite . due to these reasons ,",
    "the numerical criteria on the behavior of boxes become impossible to verify by hand . to overcome this difficulty we introduce _ rigorous interval arithmetic _  @xcite and check several criteria .",
    "the second one is the introduction of numerical tools such as _ set - oriented computations _  @xcite and the _ interval krawczyk method",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the former is an algorithm to generate a sequence of outer approximations of an invariant set in terms of the map to iterate .",
    "it is used to compute the rigorous enclosure of invariant manifolds of the map with very high accuracy , which is the key to exclude the occurrence of unnecessary tangencies .",
    "the latter is a modification of the well - known newton s root - finding method .",
    "it is used to guarantee the existence of non - real periodic orbits of @xmath7 for @xmath17 in a certain parameter region , which yields that the topological entropy on @xmath0 is non - maximal .",
    "we note that , in the process of our proof , the fourth iteration of the hnon map is considered .",
    "this amounts to a polynomial of degree 16 and its large expansion factor increases computational error drastically . therefore , the rigorous computation of invariant manifolds and the zeros of such polynomial with respect to projective coordinates , where its parameter varies over a small region in the parameter space , is not at all an immediate task .",
    "details on the numerical verifications will be discussed in appendix  [ appendixb ] .",

    "the difficulty lies in the construction of the projective box system .",
    "for example , to verify bcc for the transition @xmath1149 , the absolute values of @xmath1150|$ ] and @xmath1151|$ ] should be large enough so that the image of @xmath1152 does not intersect with @xmath1153 .",
    "however , if these values are too large , then it is likely that the ( bcc ) for the transition @xmath1154 fails , in turn .",
    "therefore , we must choose adequate values of @xmath1155|$ ] and @xmath1156|$ ] carefully so that ( bcc ) holds for all the possible transitions .",
    "another issue that we need to pay attention is the precision of the coordinate change .",
    "while the hnon map itself is defined in the euclidean coordinate , the ( bcc ) is described in the projective coordinate .",
    "therefore , the verification of the ( bbc ) involves the rigorous interval arithmetic for the coordinate change between them .",
    "this becomes problematic when the focus @xmath114 ( or @xmath122 ; see figure  [ fig : projective_coordinates ] ) is too close to the projective box , because then a small divisor appears in the coordinate change form euclidean one to projective one , resulting loss of precision in the interval arithmetic .",

    "\\(i ) _ interval krawczyk method . _",
    "below we review the ideas behind the interval krawczyk method .",
    "basically , it is obtained as a modification of the well - known newton s root - finding method adapted to the interval arithmetic .",
    "let @xmath1159 be a smooth map .",
    "the newton s method for solving @xmath1160 is given by @xmath1161 in general , however , it is not easy to check that @xmath1162 is invertible for a small neighborhood @xmath510 of @xmath118 due to the wrapping effect of interval arithmetic .    to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we modify the newton s method as follows . for any invertible matrix @xmath1017 ,",
    "let us define the modified newton s method as @xmath1163 if the condition @xmath1164 were verified for the product set @xmath1165 of @xmath652 closed intervals , there would exist a unique @xmath1166 with @xmath1167 . in practice , @xmath1017 will be a numerical approximation of @xmath1168 for some @xmath1169 .",
    "the point here is that @xmath1017 is not an interval matrix ; it is just an usual matrix of real numbers .",
    "we can thus avoid taking the inverse of an interval matrix .",
    "however , since @xmath1170 it turns out that the condition @xmath1164 always fails .    to improve this circumstance , rudolf krawczyk introduced the following idea ( see equation ( 13 ) in page 177 of  @xcite ) .",
    "fix a base - point @xmath1171 .",
    "the interval mean - value theorem yields @xmath1172 where @xmath675 is the identity matrix .",
    "the operator @xmath1173 is called the _ interval krawczyk operator_.    note that @xmath1174 is a point and @xmath1175 is a translation of @xmath1024 .",
    "if the matrix @xmath1017 is chosen so that @xmath1176 is close to @xmath675 , we have @xmath1177 .    with this operator",
    "we obtain the next result which is useful to show ( i ) of theorem  [ quasitrichotomy ] ( quasi - trichotomy ) . for a proof ,",
    "see theorem 5.1.8 of  @xcite .",
    "[ b.1 ] if @xmath1178 holds for some @xmath1017 and @xmath1171 , there exists a unique point @xmath1179 so that @xmath1167 .    to prove this , we show that for all @xmath1180 with @xmath1181 and @xmath245 , there exists a periodic point of period @xmath180 in @xmath243 .",
    "the interval krawczyk method described above can immediately be applied for this since a periodic point @xmath1182 of period @xmath1099 with respect to a map @xmath1183 is nothing more than a zero of the equation @xmath1184 satisfying @xmath1185 for @xmath1186 . however , when @xmath1099 is large or when the expansion of the map is strong , we can not hope this simple paraphrase works well . this is because the interval containing the true orbit gets expanded significantly in the unstable direction of @xmath254 and thus the inclusion property of the interval krawczyk operator is very likely to fail .",
    "this is exactly what happens for our case @xmath1187 and @xmath1188 .",
    "for this reason , we further rephrase the equation as follows .",
    "let @xmath1189 be unknowns and consider the set of @xmath1099 equations : @xmath1190 obviously , the zeros of this system are the fixed points of @xmath1191 .",
    "the new equation is , although its dimension is @xmath1099 times larger than the original equation , usually much easier to solve with the interval krawczyk method since here we do not take any higher iteration of the map .",
    "see @xcite for more detailed discussion on the application of the interval krawczyk method to dynamical systems .",
    "the actual verification process goes as follows .",
    "we first construct a covering of the bounded set in the parameter space : @xmath1192 by small rectangles of the form @xmath1193 where @xmath1017 and @xmath1085 are closed intervals . for each small rectangle @xmath1193",
    ", we select a parameter value @xmath1194 .",
    "we then use the conventional newton s method to numerically find a candidate @xmath1195 of periodic orbit of period @xmath180 with respect to @xmath7 such that @xmath1196 for @xmath1197 .",
    "next , we verify the inclusion property of the interval krawczyk operator for a small rectangle @xmath1198 containing @xmath1199 .",
    "this establish the existence of a fixed point @xmath1200 of @xmath1201 in @xmath243 for all @xmath1194 .",
    "it easy to check that @xmath1200 is not fixed by @xmath7 and thus we conclude @xmath1200 is a periodic point of period @xmath180 .",
    "\\(ii ) _ set - oriented algorithm .",
    "_ by the set - oriented algorithm we refer to a set of similar algorithms for rigorously enclosing invariant objects of dynamical systems . in these algorithms , as the name suggests , we compute the time evolution of sets in the phase space instead of computing the orbit of each point @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1202 be a dynamical system and @xmath1203 a compact set on which we want to know the behavior of @xmath254 .",
    "consider a finite rectangular grid on @xmath1204 and assume that @xmath1204 decomposes into into smaller rectangles @xmath1205 where @xmath675 is the index set . by applying the interval arithmetic",
    ", we can find a subset @xmath1206 for each @xmath1207 such that @xmath1208 rigorously holds .",
    "the set @xmath1209 is a rigorous outer approximation of the actual image @xmath1210 , which is hopefully not too large provided the interval arithmetic works well . for polynomial maps such as the hnon map we can safely assume the outer approximation is fine enough .",
    "then we construct a directed graph @xmath1211 by the following rule .",
    "the vertices of @xmath1211 is just @xmath675 .",
    "we put an edge from @xmath356 to @xmath1212 if and only if @xmath1213 . the graph @xmath1211 can be understood as a combinatorial representation of the dynamics of @xmath254 and in fact has a very nice property ; if @xmath1214 and @xmath1215 then there must be an edge of @xmath1211 from @xmath1087 to @xmath1088 .",
    "thus , if there is no edge from @xmath1087 to itself , then it immediately implies that there is no fixed point of @xmath254 in @xmath1216 .",
    "the maximal invariant set : @xmath1217 also has a combinatorial counterpart in @xmath1211 .",
    "a path in @xmath1211 is a consecutive sequence of edges ( multiple appearance of an edge is allowed ) .",
    "let @xmath1218 be the set of vertices @xmath122 of @xmath1211 such that there exists a bi - infinite path through @xmath122 .",
    "then , the inclusion : @xmath1219 holds .",
    "this is exactly how we construct rigorous outer approximations of the julia set .    for these verifications",
    ", we must precisely locate the filled julia set and some pieces of invariant manifolds .",
    "the set - oriented algorithms explained above will be extensively used for this .",
    "the algorithm for computing the filled julia set is already mentioned ; now we explain how to use the graph @xmath1211 defined above to construct an outer approximation of invariant manifolds . recall that the pieces of invariant manifolds we want to control are defined by nested sequences of the iterations of boxes .",
    "for example , we consider @xmath1220 let @xmath1204 be a rectangle containing @xmath438 , and @xmath1205 be its decomposition into smaller rectangles .",
    "let @xmath1211 be the graph associated to this decomposition and the map @xmath7 .",
    "now we compute @xmath1221 , the set of vertices @xmath122 of @xmath1211 such that there exists a one - sided path starting from @xmath122 . then , again the inclusion : @xmath1222 rigorously holds . by taking the preimage of this rigorous covering of @xmath1223 , again using the set - oriented algorithm , we can also construct a rigorous covering of @xmath1224 . in the same way ,",
    "a rigorous covering of @xmath787 can be obtained .",
    "thus , by verifying @xmath1225 using the interval arithmetic on the intersection of these coverings , we complete the proof of numerical check e.    the strategies for the remaining numerical checks are similar .",
    "recall that in subsection  [ subsection2.2 ] we have employed a @xmath171-box system @xmath1226 for @xmath294 based on a trellis formed by the invariant manifolds of the saddle fixed point @xmath434 and the saddle periodic points @xmath1227 and @xmath1228 of period two .",
    "it is of course possible to construct a @xmath190-box system @xmath1229 for @xmath294 in a similar manner to the case @xmath389 based on a trellis formed by the invariant manifolds of the two saddle fixed points @xmath434 and @xmath442 .",
    "however , when @xmath19 is close to @xmath763 , the fixed point @xmath442 is relatively close to the @xmath154-axis and thus the expansion and the contraction at this point are relatively weak compared to the case @xmath389 . in fact , the multipliers are @xmath1230 and @xmath1231 for @xmath1232 , but @xmath1233 and @xmath1234 for @xmath1235 .",
    "it is numerically observed , presumably due to this fact , that the crossed mapping condition for the `` neighboring transitions '' @xmath1236 and @xmath1237 around @xmath442 is hardly satisfied when @xmath19 is close to @xmath763 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath171-box system @xmath1226 avoids such neighboring transitions .",
    "this is the main advantage of the @xmath171-box system @xmath1226 .",
    "next we discuss the @xmath1238-box system investigated in  @xcite . for @xmath4 ,",
    "let @xmath1239 and @xmath1240 we then define @xmath1241 for @xmath1242 .",
    "put @xmath1243 so that @xmath1244={\\mathbb{r}}\\cap d_1 $ ] .",
    "then , a sufficient condition for the ( cmc ) is @xmath1245 .",
    "the shaded region we were able to verify the ( cmc ) for @xmath1246 as in ( ii ) of theorem  [ quasitrichotomy ] ( quasi - trichotomy ) .",
    "however , we numerically observed that the ( cmc ) is hardly verified for @xmath1247 with our @xmath171-box system . ] , the dashed and solid lines in figure  [ fig : comparison ] are the regions @xmath1089 , the curve @xmath1248 and the graph of the function @xmath69 , respectively .",
