    "observations with the pamela @xcite and atic / ppb - bets @xcite experiments have implied or shown anomaly in the positron fraction and a sharp feature in the cr electron spectrum , although fermi satellite recently reported that the feature in the electron spectrum is much smaller or even absent depending on the uncertainty of the background cosmic - ray electron and positron spectrum @xcite .",
    "the pamela ( and atic / ppb - bets ) results indicate that there should be an unknown source of electrons and positrons .",
    "one attractive idea of the source is the annihilation or decay of weakly interacting dark matter particles @xcite . the other is astrophysical scenarios such as pulsars @xcite .    among the astrophysical sources , supernova remnants ( snrs ) are one of the promising candidates for the electron and positron source .",
    "their synchrotron emission reveals the existence of high energy electrons in snrs @xcite , and their @xmath1-ray emission would indicate that of high energy protons @xcite , although there has been no direct evidence of proton acceleration in snrs yet .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the observed electron and positron excesses can naturally be explained by recent supernova explosions near the earth .",
    "in fact the low - density local bubble ( lb ) , in which the solar system locates , and the adjacent bubble ( loop  i ) with sizes of @xmath2100  pc are often thought to be created through @xmath22040 supernova explosions that started @xmath3  yrs ago @xcite . since those explosions occurred close to us ( @xmath4200  pc ) , they could have affected the environment around the solar system more significantly than the supernova explosions in the spiral arms @xmath2kpc away @xcite .",
    "we consider supernova explosions that happened @xmath5  yrs ago in a dense gas cloud ( dc ) @xmath2100200  pc away from the earth .",
    "the dc does not necessarily correspond to the host dcs of the supernovae that created the lb or loop  i. massive stars that explode as supernovae tend to be born in giant dcs @xcite .",
    "they may explode near or inside the host dcs , because their durations of life are short . in this paper",
    ", we assume that although a dc had not been destroyed by ultra - violet radiation from massive , short - lived ob stars , it is ionized and the temperature is @xmath6  k when those stars explode @xcite . in such environments ,",
    "the shock front of an snr accelerates protons , which create electrons and positrons through hadronic interactions in the surrounding dc .",
    "the evolution of a snr and the particle acceleration around it is modeled following a previous study @xcite .",
    "the shock velocity @xmath7 is written as a function of the snr age ( @xmath8 ) as @xmath9 where @xmath10  cm  s@xmath11 is the initial velocity , and @xmath12  erg is the initial energy of the ejecta .",
    "when we consider multiple supernova explosions , we simply assume that they explode almost simultaneously ( within a time - scale of the destruction of the dc ) and give a larger @xmath13 than that of a single supernova . at @xmath14",
    "yr , the snr is in the free expansion phase , at @xmath15  yr , it is in the radiative phase , and at @xmath16 , it is in the sedov phase . here",
    "@xmath17 is the proton density of the dc .",
    "we assume that the energy spectrum of the accelerated protons is @xmath18 the index is represented by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the compression ratio of the shock @xcite , which is given by the rankine - hugoniot relation for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the upstream alfvn velocity @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy is determined by the age of snr : @xmath25",
    "where @xmath26 cm  s@xmath11 , @xmath27 is the factor determined by the shock angle and the gyro - factor , and @xmath28 is the downstream magnetic field , which is expressed by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the magnetic field in the dc @xcite . since we consider an ionized dc , we ignore the ion - neutral wave damping at the upstream of a shock ( for particle acceleration in a radiative phase , see @xcite ) .",
    "we equate the minimum energy of the protons with the proton rest - mass energy .",
    "we assume that supernovae explode at the center of a dc for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we take @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 from now on .",
    "we consider the case where a few supernovae ( or one hypernova ) explode almost simultaneously .",
    "thus we assume that @xmath34 , from which we obtain @xmath35  yr and @xmath36  yr , if the proton density inside the dc is @xmath37 . at @xmath38  yr , the mach number and radius of the snr are @xmath39 and @xmath40  pc , respectively . at this point , the snr is in the radiative phase .",
    "we assume that particle acceleration around a snr ceases for @xmath41 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , although the exact value is not clear .",
    "we refer to the age at which @xmath39 as @xmath42 .    at @xmath43",
    ", we obtain @xmath44 and @xmath45  tev .",
    "although particle acceleration stops at this time , the snr continues to expand .",
    "the radius is @xmath46  pc at @xmath47  yr . since it is comparable to the size of a giant dc @xcite and @xmath13 is larger than the binding energy of a dc , the cloud would be destroyed around this time .",
    "until destroyed , the dc is illuminated by the accelerated protons from the inside with the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ne ] ) given at @xmath48",
    ". the duration of the exposure ( @xmath49 ) could be approximated by the time elapsing from the explosion of the supernovae to the destruction of the dc because of the short time - scale of @xmath50 .",
    "the protons create @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 through @xmath55 collisions in the dc for the period of @xmath56 . based on this scenario ,",
    "we calculate their spectrum observed at the earth , and search parameters that are consistent with observations .",
    "since the model of the snr evolution may have some uncertainties , we do not stick to the exact values of parameters in the above discussion .",
    "after the destruction of the dc , the created @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 propagate through diffusion processes and reach to the earth .",
    "since we assume that the dc has already been destroyed until the current epoch , there is a difference in the last arrival time between massless neutral particles such as photons and neutrinos , and charged particles .",
    "we would not detect any photon and neutrino signals from the dc @xmath5 yrs after the destruction .",
    "we have calculated spectra of those daughter particles of the @xmath55 collisions by performing the pythia monte - carlo event generator  @xcite .",
    "then we solve the diffusion equation of the charged particle `` @xmath57 '' ( @xmath57 runs @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , @xmath58 + q(\\varepsilon_{i})\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the distribution function of @xmath57 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the energy of @xmath57 .",
    "the flux @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 . for electrons and positrons , according to a model 08 - 005 in  @xcite , we take @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the cooling rate through the synchrotron emission and the inverse compton scattering is given by @xmath67/1.1\\ ] ] @xcite , where @xmath68 is the magnetic field outside the dc .",
    "these parameters approximately correspond to so - called `` med model '' of the particle propagation  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the timescale of the production is shorter than the diffusion timescale @xmath69 , and the daughter - particle source is spatially localized well , we can also use the analytical solution in  @xcite .",
    "when the shape of the source spectrum is a power - law with an index @xmath70 , @xmath71 , the solution is represented by @xmath72 with @xmath73 and the diffusion length @xmath74 here we took an effective distance to the source @xmath75 , which is calculated by spatially averaging the distance to the volume element of the source , and @xmath76 in the current calculation .",
    "the time after the input of the daughter particles is defined by @xmath77 .",
    "approximately @xmath78 is represented by @xmath79 with @xmath80 the volume of the source and @xmath81 here the differential cross section of the `` @xmath82''-mode for the production of @xmath57 particle is @xmath83 with its multiplicity @xmath84 .",
    "we also consider the neutron decay for the electron / positron production , which is not included in the original version of pythia .",
    "the initial proton spectrum @xmath85 is normalized to be @xmath86 which is given later .    for the local propagation of @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    ", the cooling term is negligible . in addition",
    ", we may omit the annihilation of antiprotons through scattering off the background protons because the mean free path for the annihilation reaction is large .",
    "we can also omit the convection by the convective wind .",
    "thus the analytical solution for the proton and antiproton can be also given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_diff ] ) with taking a limit of @xmath87 .",
    "[ fig : fr1 ] shows the positron fraction and the @xmath88-@xmath89 flux observed at the earth .",
    "we assume that a spherical dc with a radius of @xmath90  pc and proton density of @xmath91 is uniformly illuminated by protons with the spectrum given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ne ] ) with @xmath92 and @xmath93  tev for the duration of @xmath94  yr .",
    "the total energy of the primary cosmic - ray protons is taken to be @xmath95  erg .",
    "the distance to the front side of the dc is @xmath96  pc .",
    "we assume that the diffusion time of @xmath88 and @xmath89 is @xmath97  yr , and @xmath98 .",
    "we refer to this parameter set as case  a. observational results are also shown .",
    "this result is consistent with observations for the positron fraction , and the @xmath88-@xmath89 flux obtained with ppb - bets and atic2 .",
    "the feature of the positron spectrum can intuitively be understood as follows .",
    "the spectrum of the secondary @xmath88 and @xmath89 from the dc is harder than that of the background one , because the primary protons are mainly produced in the radiative phase of the snr with the compression ratio @xmath20 much larger than 4 .",
    "the cutoff scale is given by @xmath99 gev @xmath100 .",
    "the sharp rise around the cutoff energy is made by @xmath88 and @xmath89 accumulated through cooling .",
    "that is because we are considering the case of @xmath101 , which means that many of the cooled electrons sizably contribute to modifying the spectral shape around the cutoff energy .",
    "however , the actual spectrum would be broader with a width of @xmath102 , because the injection continues for a finite duration @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "but for case  b.,width=340 ]        fig .",
    "[ fig : fr2 ] is another example of the positron fraction and the @xmath88-@xmath89 flux . in this case (",
    "case  b ) , we adopt @xmath90  pc , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath93  tev , @xmath105  yr , @xmath106  erg , @xmath96  pc , @xmath107  yr , and @xmath98 . the results are consistent with observations for the positron fraction and the @xmath88-@xmath89 flux obtained with fermi . since we have not performed a complete parameter search , cases  a and  b should be regarded as examples among possibilities .",
    "[ fig : anti_p ] shows the antiproton fraction at the earth . in our scenario",
    ", the flux of anti - protons dominates that of the background for @xmath0  gev , which can be used to discriminate our hadronic scenario from other leptonic ones .",
    "antiproton fraction rises at higher energies than that of the positron fraction ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fr1 ] and  [ fig : fr2 ] ) , because the spectral index of the background antiproton is harder than that of the background positron .",
    "so far the pamela antiproton data could not have distinguished one model from another yet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : anti_p ] ) .",
    "we note that old snrs in dcs could be observed as unidentified tev sources @xcite .",
    "broad - band spectra of the old snrs could constrain the parameters of our scenario .",
    "it is likely that the dc has made a star cluster , which might be identified near the earth .",
    "recent observations have shown possible decline of b / c ratio toward higher energies ( @xmath0  gev ) , which seems to be inconsistent with the present scenario because snrs also accelerate metals @xcite . in our scenario , however , the source of electrons and positrons is the snr in a specific dense cloud , and it is very localized .",
    "thus it is subjected to the variation of metal abundances in the galaxy .",
    "in fact the abundance of carbon in carina nebula , which is a star forming region in the galaxy , is @xmath108 solar value @xcite .",
    "if the dense cloud we considered has such a low metal abundance , the cosmic - rays from the cloud does not increase the observed b / c ratio .",
    "moreover our scenario requires that the dense cloud has not been destroyed by stellar winds before the explosion of the stars .",
    "it is known that stellar winds are weaker for stars with lower metal abundances , and that the metal abundances of stars are correlated with those of the host cloud .",
    "thus the cloud in which electrons and positrons are effectively generated may tend to have low metal abundances . in summary",
    "our scenario can not be rejected only by the present observational data of the b / c ratio .",
