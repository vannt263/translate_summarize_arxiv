    "in performing variational calculations for ground - state energies for many - body nuclear hamiltonians , quite often we are left with the problem of obtaining reasonable values for the excitation energies . in the hybrid multideterminant method ( hmd ) ( ref.[1 ] ) for example , we assume that the ground - state wave function is well described by a sum of ( usually projected to good angular momentum and parity ) generic ( that is no restrictions are imposed ) slater determinants .",
    "both the slater determinants and the coefficients of the linear combination are determined by minimizing the expectation values of the hamiltonian . by increasing the number of the slater determinants",
    "we obtain increasingly accurate values of the ground - state energy as compared to the exact ones .",
    "equivalently , after the minimization procedure has been carried out , we can diagonalize the many - body hamiltonian in the basis of these slater determinants and obtain a set of eigenvalues",
    ". however all eigenvalues , except the ground - state , give a rather poor description of the excitation energies , unless the basis consists of a very large number of slater determinants .",
    "this is not very surprising since the basis has been determined so as to minimize the ground - state energy , and therefore all other eigenvalues are usually much higher than the exact ones . more than @xmath3 years ago",
    ", a method to remove this deficiency has been proposed in variational calculations using quasi - particle determinants , that is , the excited - mad - vampir approach ( ref.[2 ] ) .",
    "the method consists in first to obtain the ground - state wave function , with the appropriate number of particles , angular momentum and parity , and then to determine the first excited state imposing at every step orthogonality ( with the gram - schmidt method ) to the ground - state wave function .",
    "the method is iterated until all the desired excited state are obtained .",
    "we have applied this excited method to the hmd method .",
    "our version of the computer program increases the corresponding ground - state by about 170 lines in fortran 77 .",
    "we found however a much simpler method to obtain excited states which can be implemented by the addition of very few lines to the computer program for the ground - state .",
    "moreover if , after the calculation has been finished , we wish to increase the accuracy of the low energy wave functions , in the excited method we would presumably have to repeat the calculation .",
    "the method we propose does not have this inconvenience and it is very flexible and easy to implement .",
    "the method is based on the idea that in order to increase the sensitivity of the minimization method on the position of the excited states energies(rather than just on the ground - state energy ) the quantity to be minimized is some weighed average of the the first few low - lying eigenvalues obtained from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the basis of the slater determinants .",
    "for example for three states the functional to be minimized is @xmath4 with the weights @xmath5 .",
    "we call this method the centroid hmd method ( chmd ) .",
    "it takes very few lines to modify the ground - state computer program to implement this idea .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review in more detail the excited method ( see however the original work of ref.[2 ] ) and the centroid method . in section 3",
    "we test the method by comparing the exact energies of @xmath0 recently obtained by shell model diagonalization in refs .",
    "[ 3],[4 ] .",
    "in the excited method , that we apply here to slater determinants rather than to quasi - particle states , we assume to have determined an accurate approximation to the ground - state of the many - body hamiltonian @xmath6 as @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are variational slater determinants with good quantum numbers ( angular momentum , etc . )",
    "restored with projectors .",
    "@xmath9 is the number of slater determinants necessary for good convergence to the ground - state energy ( for non - zero angular momentum it includes also the @xmath10 quantum number ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 are determined by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath12 @xmath13 being the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "all other eigenvalues obtained in eq.(2 ) are discarded since they are a poor approximation to the energies of the excited states .",
    "the slater determinants in eq.(1 ) can be generated with a two steps method . in the first step ( addition step )",
    "slater determinants are added to the basis one by one and each slater determinant is varied so as to minimize the ground - state energy . in the second step ( refinement step ) once the basis is constructed , each slater determinant is varied anew ( ref.[5 ] ) .",
    "the motivation for this second step is that the first slater determinants have been varied when the basis contained few slater determinants .",
    "ideally , we would want to minimize the energy by varying all slater determinants simultaneously , while in the addition step only the last added one is varied .",
    "the refinement step corrects this partial variation .    for the excited states one makes use of a variational ansatzs similar to eq.(1 ) @xmath14 and the excited states are written as @xmath15 the coefficients @xmath16 ( @xmath17 )",
    "are determined so that @xmath18 .",
    "the wave functions in eq . ( 3 ) are determined by minimizing @xmath19 in the above equation only the @xmath20 are varied , all previous @xmath21 for @xmath22 are kept fixed and the coefficients @xmath23 ( @xmath22 ) are determined by the orthogonality condition .",
    "the result of the gram - schmidt method can be recast in a compact form as follows . as in ref . [ 2 ] , if we define the overlap matrix between previously determined non - orthogonal wave functions as @xmath24 and its inverse @xmath25 of dimension @xmath26 and the gram - schmidt projector as @xmath27 then the @xmath28 state given by the gram - schmidt procedure is @xmath29 and the quantity to be minimized is @xmath30 that is @xmath31 in the above equation the sum over repeated indices , except @xmath32 , is understood , and @xmath33 .",
    "the quantities @xmath34 can be stored in the previous calculations .",
    "all overlaps and matrix elements in eq.(10 ) are angular momentum projected , and their evaluation is certainly the most expensive part of the calculation . the minimization step is performed with quasi - newtonian methods ( cf .",
    "ref.[6]-[8 ] and references in there ) once the derivatives of @xmath35 with respect to the entries of the slater determinants have been determined . clearly after the calculation of several levels has been performed",
    "if we wish to have more accurate wave - functions we would have to determine anew at least some of the eigenstates .    in the chmd method instead we use only the ansatz @xmath36 and , after the matrix elements @xmath37 and @xmath38 have been evaluated we solve the generalized eigenvalue problem , written in a matrix notation as @xmath39 and obtain all @xmath40 for @xmath41 and the energies @xmath42 .",
    "the input to the minimization procedure is then @xmath43 with positive weights @xmath44 .",
    "we typically take only few states in the sum . as a rule of the thumb @xmath45 etc . especially for a small number of slater determinants",
    "the reason is that the location of the excited states is very sensitive to the values of @xmath46 .",
    "if we take comparable values for the weights , we could have an increase ( rather than a decrease ) of the ground - state energy , even though the centroid would decrease , because of the large contribution of the higher eigenvalues of eq.(12 ) .",
    "therefore we prefer to assign a large weight to the ground - state so a decrease in the centroid generally gives a decrease of all energies included in the sum .",
    "only when the energies are sufficiently refined we can take comparable values for the weights .",
    "there is a very interesting limit of this method , namely when all @xmath47 except one . in this case",
    "we first determine the ground - state with @xmath48 ( using @xmath9 slater determinants ) then we keep adding @xmath49 slater determinants to the basis setting @xmath50 ( the dimension of eq . ( 12 ) is now @xmath51 ) , then we proceed setting @xmath52 and add @xmath53 additional slater determinants . of course we do not vary the slater determinants which belong to eigenstates different from the desired one . in this way we simulate the excited method but we can improve at wish previously determined eigenstates without any concern for orthogonality which is automatically taken care by the diagonalization of eq.(12 ) .",
    "note that if we generate eigenstates in sequence by adding slater determinants one after the other , that is if we use only the addition step without the refinement step , we need no new computer program at all .",
    "in fact , after @xmath9 slater determinants have been generated for the ground - state , we can simply select the first excited state in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , the label of the desired eigenstate being an input parameter and keep adding more slater determinants to the basis , minimizing @xmath54 without any modification to the computer program .    note that the number of projected matrix elements to be computed in this limit , is the same as in the excited method . when we are varying the slater determinants for the excited states , the ground - state energy decreases although by small amounts .",
    "the main difference between this limiting case ( that is all @xmath55 s set to @xmath56 except one ) and the excited method is that we make use of eq.(12 ) in a basis consisting of all @xmath57 slater determinants , while the excited method uses only @xmath49 slater determinants for the first excited state , @xmath53 for the second excited state and so on . in the next section we apply the chmd method to the case of @xmath0 .",
    "as an application of the chmd method we consider @xmath0 with an inert @xmath58 core , the hamiltonian for the valence nucleons is the @xmath1 hamiltonian ( ref . [ 9 ] ) .",
    "this case has been investigated recently with shell model diagonalization in the full space in ref.[3 ] .",
    "the energies for the @xmath59 and @xmath60 states are @xmath61mev , @xmath62mev , @xmath63mev ( ref.[4 ] ) . for the @xmath64 state",
    "the shell model value is @xmath65mev .",
    "since we have only three states from the shell model calculation we consider a centroid with only the first three states .",
    "let us consider first the limiting case where only one of the @xmath55 s is non - zero .",
    "we consider the following sequence .",
    "first we generate @xmath66 slater determinants with @xmath67 , and obtained @xmath68mev , @xmath69mev , @xmath70mev . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "although the ground - state energy is well approximated ( only @xmath71kev above the exact value ) , the first excited @xmath72 state is about @xmath73 mev above the exact value and even worse the second excited @xmath72 state is about @xmath74 mev above the exact value .",
    "we then added @xmath66 more slater determinants to the chmd basis with @xmath75 and obtained @xmath76mev , @xmath77mev , @xmath78mev .",
    "the first excited @xmath72 state is now only @xmath79 above the exact value and also the energy of the @xmath60 state has dramatically improved .",
    "we added then @xmath66 more slater determinants to the chmd basis with @xmath52 and obtained @xmath80mev , @xmath81mev , @xmath82mev .",
    "the discrepancy for the @xmath60 state is now only @xmath83 kev , and also the energies for the @xmath84 and @xmath85 states have improved . with only @xmath86 slater determinants we obtained very good values of the energies for @xmath87 states .",
    "we decided then to improve on the ground - state and on the first excited @xmath72 state .",
    "the full sequence of calculation is now @xmath66 slater determinants for @xmath84 , @xmath66 slater determinants for @xmath85 , @xmath66 slater determinants for @xmath60 , @xmath88 more slater determinants for the @xmath84 state and @xmath88 more slater determinants for the @xmath85 state .",
    "the energies thus obtained are @xmath89mev , @xmath90mev , @xmath91mev .",
    "the discrepancies from the exact values are @xmath92kev,@xmath93kev and @xmath94kev for the @xmath95 states respectively . in fig .",
    "1 we show the behavior of the energies as a function of of the number of slater determinants . the effect of the changes in the weights is clearly recognizable .      for this set of states we considered also a few more calculations with all non - zero @xmath96 . initially",
    "the ground - state is strongly overweighted , then as the number of slater determinants is increased we allow for more balanced values and at the end @xmath97 . for a set of @xmath98 slater determinants we obtained @xmath99mev , @xmath100mev , @xmath101mev , in line with the previous results .    for the @xmath102 states we evaluated the first @xmath87 states , as before .",
    "we have used @xmath98 slater determinants and used non - zero values for the weights .",
    "our results are @xmath103mev , @xmath104mev and @xmath105mev .",
    "the energy of the @xmath64 state is about @xmath106kev higher than the shell model value .",
    "the shell model values for the other states are not available .",
    "although , there is still some room for a further decrease in the energies , the excitation energies seem to be stable enough as a function of the number of slater determinants , whithin an uncertainty of few tens of kev .",
