    "liquid helium system has a total hamiltonian as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mass of a helium atom , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively signify the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we examine the general form of the total energy via the unitary transformation @xmath4 diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "all eigenstates are described as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the vacuum state .",
    "new creation and annihilation operators are defined as    @xmath8    which indicate the creation and annihilation operators of a quasi - particle .",
    "we designate this quasi - particle as a `` dressed boson '' .",
    "the dressed boson number operator is defined as    @xmath9    the total number conservation and the total momentum conservation are expressed as    @xmath10    that is to say , the total number of helium atoms is equal to the total number of dressed bosons and the total momentum of helium atoms is equal to the total momentum of dressed bosons .",

    "the single excitation state has a distribution of @xmath18 and therefore its total energy is derived from eq.([eq : d ] ) as follows :    @xmath19    where we have used @xmath20 and the spherical symmetric property of the function @xmath21 .",
    "therein , the latent heat at zero kelvin is equal to @xmath22 . accordingly",
    "the elementary excitation energy at zero kelvin is given by @xmath23 .",
    "this relation engenders a function form of the nonlinear term as @xcite    @xmath24",

    "we adopt the landau distribution function as the zero - th order distribution : @xmath29 the j - th order solutions are derived from the ( j-1)-th distribution function as follows : @xmath30 this j - th energy form produces the j - th distribution function : @xmath31 therein the excitation energy from the bose - einstein condensate of dressed bosons is expressed as @xmath32 we can evaluate the second order solutions @xmath33 and @xmath34 via the iteration processes from the zero - th order distribution .",

    "it is noteworthy that the present calculation uses the experimental values of excitation energy only for the temperature 1.1 k. of course the iteration method is insufficient in close vicinity of the @xmath37 transition temperature .",
    "we have discussed origin of the logarithmic divergence at the @xmath37 point in the previous paper @xcite . it is clarified that the logarithmic divergence is caused by the nonlinear mechanism of the total energy .",
