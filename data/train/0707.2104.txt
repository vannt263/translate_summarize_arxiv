    "the density of magnetic vortices increases , while the field inhomogeneity of the fll decreases .",
    "consequently , at higher magnetic field the static broadening of the @xmath0sr line shape by the magnetism becomes more discernable [ see figs .",

    "[ fig4](d)-(f ) ] signifies thermal destruction of the static magnetism in and around the vortex cores .",
    "while the onset of sg magnetism in and around the vortex cores fully explains our experimental observations , we note that the change in the @xmath0sr line shape across the mic is somewhat reminiscent of that observed across the 3d - to-2d vortex crossover field in highly anisotropic bi@xmath94sr@xmath3cacu@xmath2o@xmath95 ( bscco).@xcite in this case random pinning - induced misalignment of the stacked 2d ` pancake ' vortices that comprise the 3d flux lines in bssco , narrows and reduces the asymmetry of the @xmath0sr line shape .",
    "the two ingredients necessary for such a crossover are weak coupling between the cuo@xmath2 planes and a source of pinning .    if the vortices in lsco:0.145 are quasi-2d , the gradual recovery of an asymmetric line shape at higher @xmath96 that is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] signifies thermal depinning of the vortices and a return to an ordered 3d fll .",
    "such a scenario has been observed in bscco.@xcite however , as already mentioned , the vortices in lsco:@xmath97 are known to be 3d.@xcite since the effective mass anisotropy @xmath98 increases with decreasing hole doping concentration,@xcite a novel mechanism that softens the vortex lines at higher doping would be needed to explain the lsco:0.145 line shapes . as for ybco:@xmath14 ,",
    "mutual inductance measurements show that even severely underdoped samples are quasi-2d only near @xmath1.@xcite the weak field dependence of the josephson plasma resonance in ybco:6.50 at low @xmath96 is also consistent with 3d vortices.@xcite thus the extreme vortex anisotropy necessary for a 2d - to-3d crossover does not seem to occur at the hole - doping concentrations investigated here .",
    "sr time spectra for ybco:@xmath14 on either side of the critical doping for the mic at @xmath83.,width=377 ]        assuming this were not the case , one could imagine an abrupt onset of disorder at the mic that drives both the logarithmic divergence of the normal - state resistivity and a 3d - to-2d vortex crossover .",
    "since the location of the mic in lsco:@xmath6 has been independently confirmed,@xcite such pinning would have to be intrinsic to the material .",
    "however , disorder in lsco:@xmath6 decreases with decreasing sr doping , and disorder due to excess or deficient oxygen primarily affects the lightly - doped and overdoped regimes , respectively .",
    "likewise , the onset of pinning below the mic is inconsistent with ortho - ii ordering in ybco:6.50 , which reduces random pinning by oxygen disorder and defects .",
    "an abrupt redistribution of charge at the mic is also not supported by our own zf-@xmath0sr measurements .",
    "previously , zf-@xmath0sr studies of cuprate superconductors have demonstrated a sensitivity to charge - poor magnetic regions @xcite , and to charge correlations @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) vortices .",
    "the major difference is that the inclusion of the interlayer coupling allows the competing phase to be stabilized in nearly isolated vortices , thus altering the position and character of the qpt .",
    "there are two key predictions of the extended theory for 3d vortices that are confirmed by our experiments .",
    "the first is that there exists a coexistence phase of spatially inhomogeneous competing order . at low fields where the interaction between vortex lines is weaker ,",
    "we have detected sg magnetism that is localized in and around the vortex cores .",
    "this means that the competing order initially stabilized at the qpt is not static magnetic order as previously established , but rather is highly disordered static magnetism .",
    "the competing magnetism is characterized by a local order parameter , namely , the mean squared local magnetization . with increasing field , stronger overlap of the magnetism around neighboring vortices may lead to a co - operative bulk crossover to long - range magnetic order , as is apparently the case in la@xmath99sr@xmath100cuo@xmath5.@xcite",
    "while field - induced static magnetic order has not been detected in ybco:@xmath14 , it is worth noting that the mic occurs at a much lower hole doping concentration ( @xmath101 ) than in lsco:@xmath6 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "consequently , very high magnetic fields are likely needed to induce long - range magnetic order in ybco:@xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , very weak fields were shown to induce magnetic order in pcco samples that are below the mic crossover at @xmath103.@xcite this is understandable , since in zero field the superconducting phase of pcco is in close proximity to the pure antiferromagnetic phase where the competing order parameter is spatially uniform throughout the sample .",
    "another key prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite is that there is an ` avoided ' qcp at @xmath104 , meaning that the qcp lies at a lower doping than the extrapolated @xmath64 value of the field - induced qpt .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) .",
    "consistent with this idea , zf-@xmath0sr studies of pure lsco:@xmath6 @xcite and ybco@xmath14 @xcite indicate that the onset temperature for coexisting static magnetism and superconductivity extrapolates to zero below the critical doping for the mic . while this is well below the doping concentration @xmath105 that tallon and others @xcite",

    "below @xmath106 , @xmath107 separates a pure sc phase from a sc phase with coexisting static magnetism ( sm ) . immediately to the left of @xmath107 the sm is disordered , becoming spatially uniform ( and possibly ordered ) above the dashed curve .",
    "the open circle is the predicted ` avoided ' qcp,@xcite whereas the solid circle indicates the ` true ' qcp at @xmath104.,width=340 ]    our experiments clearly demonstrate a change in the internal magnetic field distribution of the vortex state across the critical doping concentration for the low - temperature mic in two hole - doped high-@xmath1 superconductors . we have shown that the occurrence of sg magnetism in and around weakly interacting vortices is the most likely source of the observed changes . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show a generic zero - temperature phase diagram that is compatible with the present and previous works .",
    "we conclude that the strange localization of charge below the mic stems from competing static magnetism that is stabilized when superconductivity is suppressed by the applied field . while others have hypothesized that magnetism is the cause of the peculiar localization of charge , the experiments here establish that static magnetism not present in zero external field does appear in an applied magnetic field immediately below the critical doping for the mic .",
    "magnetism plays a prominent role in at least one theory for the mic .",
    "in particular , marchetti _",
    "et al . _ have used a spin - charge gauge approach to show that the mic can arise from a competition between short - range magnetic order and the dissipative motion of the charge carriers.@xcite the experiments here do not rule out the possibility that there are short - range spin correlations in the field - induced magnetism immediately below the mic .",

    "<S> highly disordered magnetism confined to individual weakly interacting vortices is detected by muon spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) in two different families of high - transition - temperature ( @xmath1 ) superconductors , but only in samples on the low - doping side of the low - temperature normal state metal - to - insulator crossover ( mic ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results support an extended quantum phase transition ( qpt ) theory of competing magnetic and superconducting orders that incorporates the coupling between cuo@xmath2 planes . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to what has been inferred from previous experiments , the static magnetism that coexists with superconductivity near the field - induced qpt is not ordered . </S>",
    "<S> our findings unravel the mystery of the mic and establish that the normal state of high-@xmath1 superconductors is ubiquitously governed by a magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) in the superconducting phase . </S>"
