    "in many quantum problems in physics it is highly demanded to establish a numerical framework to simulate full dynamical processes of particle production out of equilibrium .",
    "unsettled and important problems include the leptogenesis and the baryogenesis for the explanation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "it is well - known that sakharov s three conditions are needed for the bau ; namely , @xmath1-breaking process , @xmath2 and @xmath0 violation , and out - of - equilibrium . the particle production on top of the electroweak sphaleron  @xcite accommodates a process with @xmath3 , which means that @xmath4 decays toward chemical - equilibrium [ and this is why the idea based on the su(5 ) grand unified theory  @xcite does not work out for the bau ]",
    "therefore , if the leptogenesis with some @xmath5-breaking process beyond the standard model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for example ) generates @xmath6 initially , it would amount to @xmath7 finally in chemical - equilibrium .",
    "the particle production associated with the sphaleron transition has a character of topological invariance and the index theorem relates the topological number to the change in the particle number .",
    "we must recall , however , that the sphaleron is a special static configuration at saddle - point and for more general and non - topological gauge configurations with @xmath2- and @xmath0-odd components we have to consider microscopic simulations with weyl fermions .",
    "also , to compute the momentum spectrum of produced particles with arbitrary gauge backgrounds , there is no longer mathematical elegance and some brute - force tactics with numerical simulations is indispensable .",
    "the sphaleron transition rate is proportional to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the temperature  @xcite , and so such topological fluctuations should be abundant also in the strong interaction when the physical system is heated up to @xmath10 as argued in ref .",
    "such high temperature is indeed realized in the quark - gluon plasma created in the relativistic heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiment .",
    "although the strong interaction does not break @xmath0 ( except for negligibly small strong @xmath11 ) , we can still anticipate local violation of @xmath12 and @xmath0 before thermalization  @xcite .",
    "this possibility is nowadays referred to commonly as the local parity violation ( lpv ) .",
    "theoretical and experimental challenges are still ongoing about the lpv detection ( and no direct evidence has been found for it ) .",
    "along these lines the recognition of the interplay with pulsed magnetic field @xmath13 between two heavy ions was a major breakthrough  @xcite ; @xmath13 on top of @xmath0-odd backgrounds would induce an electric current @xmath14 in parallel to @xmath13 , which is summarized in a compact formula of the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) with chiral chemical potential @xmath15  @xcite . in a realistic situation of the hic we can anticipate @xmath12 and @xmath0 violation not only from the qcd sphalerons but also from the glasma  @xcite which is a description of the initial condition of the hic in terms of coherent fields .",
    "then , without introducing @xmath15 that has huge theoretical uncertainty ( see ref.@xcite for a recent study with @xmath15 ) , we can and should directly compute the anomalous currents associated with the particle production with @xmath0-odd backgrounds composed from chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "it would be an intriguing attempt to test the cme in a table - top experiment in a way similar to the quantum hall effect .",
    "the biggest difference between the cme and the hall effect arises from the fact that the carriers of electric charge are not the ordinary particles but chiral particles ; that is , a non - zero excess of the right - handed particle number to the left - handed particle number is required  @xcite .",
    "it is quite non - trivial how to implement such a chiral battery ( usually represented by @xmath16 ) in materials .",
    "just recently the cme may have been confirmed in a system rather similar to the glasma , in which chirality imbalance is imposed by background fields that break @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .    here , to elucidate the motivation of our present study clearly ,",
    "let us discuss theoretical subtleties about the interpretation of the chiral magnetic ( and separation ) effect .    1 .   what carries the electric charge of the current",
    "in the derivation using the chern - simons - maxwell theory  @xcite the chiral magnetic current appears in ampre s law , but it takes a similar form as maxwell s displacement current . we know that maxwell s displacement current is a source for the magnetic field but no charge carrier flows ( though the poynting vector shows a flow of electromagnetic energy ) as pointed out in ref .  @xcite .",
    "what is the momentum spectrum of charged particles that flow as the chiral magnetic current ? in the derivation using the thermodynamic potential  @xcite a finite result remains after a cancellation between infinitely large momentum contributions @xmath17 , but it is unlikely in any experiment that particles with such large momenta emerge from the vacuum . in the kinetic derivation  @xcite a thermal distribution of particles",
    "is finally assumed to retrieve the exact cme coefficient , which provides us with a theoretically correct description of the dynamical current .",
    "it is , however , still needed to understand how such a distribution of particles arises . in general with arbitrary ( non - thermal ) initial conditions the particle distribution functions are not necessarily thermal and",
    "then the cme current may not obey the standard formula , which also motivates the numerical simulation .",
    "the expression @xmath18 does not always mean a flowing current but it may represent a polarization that is a static expectation value of a vector operator @xmath14 , where @xmath19 represents a certain pure state of the physical system .",
    "( we can generalize our discussions to mixed states , but the consideration with a pure state suffices for our purpose . ) in the lattice - qcd simulation in euclid spacetime as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath19 is the euclidean qcd vacuum , and the current measured with @xmath19 should be a polarization because the current is a non - equilibrium and steady dynamical phenomenon .",
    "actually the chiral separation effect @xmath20 has a natural interpretation as a spin polarization  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent study on this ) . to make a possible difference explicit we point out an example found in the computation of the chiral magnetic conductivity @xmath21 that represents a linear response in the presence of spacetime dependent @xmath22 . from fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite it is obvious that the static limit @xmath23 takes a value different from the dynamical limit @xmath24 .",
    "how can the particle motion be aligned to the magnetic field ?",
    "the conventional explanation ( i.e. , the correlation between the helicity and the spin alignment under a strong @xmath13 ) is based on a static picture corresponding to the polarization phenomenon .",
    "if there are free right - handed fermions , say , in the direction perpendicular to @xmath13 , they just move on a circle with the larmor radius classically .",
    "the spin receives a torque from the berry s curvature term , but the spin can not be aligned to @xmath13 without dissipation .",
    "also we make a comment that the kinetic derivation may look like a problem of one - particle motion , but it should be justified by the worldline formalism on the quantum level , and then the ( proper ) time may be given a meaning different from the genuine time .",
    "what is the response time for the chiral magnetic current to get activated ?",
    "it is unlikely that the current suddenly starts flowing as soon as @xmath13 and @xmath15 are turned on .",
    "( this is actually an unavoidable problem to simulate the chiral magnetic effect assuming a certain @xmath15 . )",
    "the current generation rate has been calculated only in an idealized setup , and the quantitative estimate of this response time should be crucial for experimental detection in realistic and thus disturbed environments .     in a @xmath0-odd domain realized by parallel @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the currents flow in all the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 directions ; @xmath30 is the anomalous hall current and @xmath31 is the cme current . ]    to answer these question , in this work , we consider a special setup as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , which is the schematic view of the cme setup in the hic and in the condensed matter experiment . the parallel @xmath32 and @xmath13 ( in the @xmath29 direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) form @xmath12- and @xmath0-odd product @xmath33 , and the cme current @xmath31 is induced in a direction perpendicular to @xmath32 , which is reminiscent of the anomalous hall current @xmath30 .",
    "( in this sense one can regard the cme as a 3d extension of the hall effect . ) in the hic @xmath25 and @xmath26 are abelian projected chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields  @xcite . in the sphaleron transition",
    "these fields are provided from the abelian projected part of the sphaleron gauge configuration too .",
    "then , we can address the questions in a very concrete way and we shall present short answers in order :    1 .",
    "the produced particles from the vacuum fluctuations form a current .",
    "the right - handed particles and anti - particles have asymmetric momentum distributions due to @xmath34 , where the particle number is conserved with the opposite excess from the left - handed sector ( and the current is doubled ) .",
    "therefore , the chiral magnetic effect can be realized in a non - equilibrium environment and is most relevant to the early - time dynamics of the hic involving the particle production .",
    "produced particles are accelerated by @xmath32 and the momentum should have a peak around an impulse given by the product of the lorentz force times the duration , which is the ordinary situation in the schwinger mechanism with pure @xmath32 . in the same way we can compute the distribution function with @xmath35 as well as @xmath36 that is localized in momentum space and so regions with infinitely large momenta are completely irrelevant .",
    "the particle production process is the real - time phenomenon out of equilibrium . in this sense , according to our understanding based on the particle production , @xmath37 can be interpreted as a dynamical flow of the chirality , which results simply from a different combination of the right - handed and the left - handed sectors of the present calculation .",
    "this fact supports the realization of non - zero quadrupole moment of the electric charge suggested from the chiral magnetic wave .",
    "we note that if @xmath38 were a spin polarization or a magnetization , there would be no movement of chirality in space , which is not the case in our fully dynamical setup .",
    "4 .   the particle motion has a peculiar angle distribution or asymmetric momentum distribution ( which will be demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] ) reflecting the configurations of @xmath32 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , unlike the conventional explanation , there is no need to bend the motion of classical particles nor the direction of the spin polarization with @xmath13 only .",
    "one might think that the asymmetric momentum distribution occurs from the beginning of the particle production and so there is no delay for the topological currents to flow .",
    "the plane wave , however , should be deformed into the landau wave - function after a finite @xmath13 is switched on . the response time is governed by the development in the amplitude of the landau wave - function .",
    "in particular the onsets of the particle production and the current generation may look different due to different rates .",
    "in this work we focus on the right - handed sector only and the current ( net particle ) density should be doubled ( canceled ) once the left - handed sector is taken into account .",
    "the right - handed weyl fermion should satisfy the following equation of motion : @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "we can readily construct a complete set of plane - wave solutions of eq .   for the asymptotic states where the interaction is turned off .",
    "in general a constant background @xmath41 may be coupled even without interaction . in the present work we set a gauge that makes @xmath42 for a technical reason .",
    "we can then write positive - energy particle solutions as @xmath43 with @xmath44 in a certain gauge [ or a convention for the overall u(1 ) phase ] .",
    "here we defined @xmath45 and the phase factor is : @xmath46 we can identify the anti - particle state from @xmath47 , which leads to a relation : @xmath48 . in the same way we can find the negative - energy particle and anti - particle solutions with @xmath49 , which results in @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we note that @xmath52 and @xmath53 have an energy @xmath54 , while other two , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , have an energy @xmath57 .    for the problem of particle and anti - particle production",
    "we evaluate an amplitude for the transition from a negative - energy state ( with momentum @xmath58 and vector potential @xmath59 ) to a positive - energy state ( with momentum @xmath60 and vector potential @xmath61 ) , which we can explicitly express as @xmath62 for the particles and the anti - particles , respectively .",
    "we here introduced new functions , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as solutions of the particle and the anti - particle equations of motion satisfying the following negative energy boundary conditions : @xmath65 for @xmath66 around the initial time in the past .",
    "it should be noted that the equation of motion for the anti - particle is not eq .",
    "but @xmath67 is replaced with @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "finally we can express the net particle number ( i.e.  the particle number minus the anti - particle number _ in the right - handed sector _ ) as well as the spatial currents in the following manner ( after dropping the zero - point oscillation term from @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 \\;,\\\\   & \\boldsymbol{j } = e \\int\\frac{d^3{\\boldsymbol{q}}}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\biggl [    \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{a'}}{|{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{a'}| } f({\\boldsymbol{q } } )    - \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{-a'}}{|{\\boldsymbol{q}}_{-a'}| } \\bar{f}({\\boldsymbol{q } } ) \\biggr]\\ ; ,   \\end{split } \\label{eq : currents}\\ ] ] where the distribution functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 above are defined with the amplitudes integrated over all incoming momenta , i.e. , @xmath75 these functions are naturally given an interpretation as the distribution functions of particles and anti - particles .",
    "we note that @xmath71 above is a formula equivalent to that as utilized in ref .",
    "we also make a comment on the relation to the chiral kinetic theory where the current is defined with @xmath76 and the equation of motion solves @xmath77 in terms of @xmath60 and an additional contribution from berry s curvature .",
    "the appearance of the _ canonical _ momenta @xmath78 ( shifted by @xmath61 ) in eq .   corresponds to using @xmath77 on the level of the equation of motion .",
    "still , it is highly non - trivial how to see the analytical relation between two approaches , which will be an interesting future problem .",
    "we here consider pulsed fields approximated by step functions for a duration @xmath9 .",
    "we choose the origin of the time so that we start solving eq .   numerically from @xmath79 . introducing a temporal profile defined by @xmath80",
    "we can explicitly specify the electric and magnetic fields that we want to consider here as @xmath81 this choice of the temporal profile is motivated based on the glasma dynamics in which both the external magnetic field and the chromo - fields decay within the same time scale of @xmath82  @xcite . theoretically speaking , to define the produced particle number uniquely , we should setup the asymptotic states where interaction is switched off .",
    "we also mention another possibility to prescribe the particle number in a transient state ( mostly relying on an adiabatic approximation ) as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , though we do not adopt it .",
    "it is , however , technically non - trivial how to realize the external fields as eq .   strictly . here",
    ", we will make a simpler choice of the gauge potentials : @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "we note that @xmath85 and @xmath86 and this is why we should keep @xmath87 in all the expressions for produced particles .",
    "the above vector potentials actually lead to the magnetic fields as almost desired : @xmath88 whereas the electric fields have some extra components : @xmath89 we chose the gauge   so that we can have @xmath90 because we are interested in @xmath31 .",
    "this also indicates that the current @xmath30 has not only the anomalous component but a finite contribution induced by @xmath91 .",
    "we note that in our present calculation we neglect the back - reaction and so this @xmath30 would not affect @xmath31 .",
    "because we start the simulation with the null initial condition with zero particle , this approximation for the back - reaction is expected to hold well especially for our setup with pulsed fields . in principle our formulation can be upgraded to the classical statistical simulation containing back - reaction  @xcite or the dirac equations can be combined with a numerical solution of maxwell s equations .",
    "the classical evolution suffices for our present purpose to figure out the net particle production and associated cme current generation .",
    "let us now go into some more technical parts .",
    "it is convenient to keep the reflection symmetry of axes in order to avoid non - vanishing currents due to lattice artifact .",
    "a perturbation theory in terms of @xmath92 would give a term like @xmath93 that should be vanishing after the spatial integrations .",
    "this can be non - perturbatively realized on the lattice by the periodicity of the link variables .",
    "alternatively , if we take the spatial sites @xmath94 ( that gives @xmath95 with the lattice spacing @xmath96 ) from @xmath97 to @xmath98 for @xmath99 , these terms @xmath93 trivially disappear .",
    "the spatial volume is thus @xmath100 in the present simulation .",
    "the corresponding momenta are discretized as @xmath101 .",
    "we also note that we impose the anti - periodic boundary condition to avoid the singularity at @xmath102 in eq .   or in eq .",
    "this means that @xmath103 should take half integral values from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "we emphasize here that , if the spatial volume is large enough , it does not matter whether the boundary condition is periodic or anti - periodic .",
    "this is simply a prescription not to hit the singularity at @xmath102 .",
    "one might think that one could insert a small regulator in the denominator like the @xmath106 prescription .",
    "indeed , one could adopt the periodic boundary condition and could take an average of contributions from six neighbors , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 around @xmath102 . as seen in momentum space , however , such an averaging procedure is effectively identical to imposing the anti - periodic boundary condition . in any case",
    "we should carefully treat the singularity at @xmath102 because this infrared singularity is responsible for the axial anomaly , which is manifested in the representation with berry s curvature  @xcite .",
    "if we integrate over all momenta , we can not avoid picking up all contributions from the doublers and the net particle production should be then absolutely zero because the axial anomaly is exactly canceled according to the nielsen - ninomiya theorem  @xcite .",
    "it is thus crucial to get rid of the doubler contributions properly . to this end",
    "we limit our momentum integration range to the half brillouin zone only , i.e. , @xmath103 from @xmath110 to @xmath111 ( which is used in ref .",
    "@xcite too ) .",
    "we note that the axial anomaly is correctly captured from the singular contributions in the wave - function around @xmath102 , though it usually appears near the ultraviolet cutoff in a diagrammatic approach .",
    "( we have numerically checked that our results are robust against small shifts at the momentum edges , which is also understandable from fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] ; produced particles are centered with small momenta . )",
    "one should not be confused with the situation in euclidean , i.e. , static lattice simulation in which the whole dirac determinant should be evaluated to identify the statistical weight for gauge configurations . for the present purpose , in contrast ,",
    "we need the information on each momentum mode , and so the computation is much more time consuming than evaluating the determinant , but it is easier to get rid of the doublers on the mode - by - mode basis .     and @xmath112 ( and integrated with respect to @xmath113 ;",
    "see the text ) .",
    "the lattice size is @xmath114 and the magnetic fields are @xmath115 . ]    when we change the lattice size and the lattice spacing @xmath96 , we should change a dimensionless @xmath116 accordingly to fix @xmath117 in the physical unit . in this work",
    "we choose a reference lattice size as @xmath118 ( i.e. , @xmath119 lattice volume ) and scale physical quantities such as @xmath120 with varying @xmath121 . to simplify the notation let us absorb @xmath67 in the field definition and omit @xmath96 hereafter .",
    "then , we take @xmath122 and change @xmath123 and @xmath124 from @xmath125 to @xmath117 .",
    "we set the duration as @xmath126 ( that is , @xmath127 for @xmath128 ) .",
    "our choice of @xmath129 is @xmath130 and we continue solving eq .   up to @xmath131 with time spacing @xmath132 using the 2nd - order runge - kutta method ( with which we carefully checked that the accuracy is good enough for our present simulation ) .",
    "we did not quantize the field strength unlike ref .",
    "actually we compared results with unquantized and quantized fields ( in the unit of @xmath133 for @xmath134 etc ) and found that this would make only negligible difference . because our calculation is classical for gauge fields ,",
    "non - quantization of the field strength is harmless for our numerical results , and moreover , technically speaking , we do not have to impose a boundary condition for the gauge fields unless we solve the equation of motion containing the derivatives of the gauge fields .",
    "even if @xmath135 , a finite @xmath117 would induce the _",
    "production of particles and anti - particles under the schwinger mechanism ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "because we deal with weyl fermion , the pair production is always possible for any @xmath136 , which leads to a finite distribution of particles with @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( and with @xmath139 for anti - particles ) . if @xmath123 or @xmath124 is finite , this distribution is smeared in momentum space as clearly observed in fig .

    "fig : dist ] in which we present @xmath140 and @xmath141 as functions of @xmath142 and @xmath112 in the case with @xmath115 .",
    "in addition to smearing , it is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist ] that the particle is more enhanced over the anti - particle because of the @xmath0-odd background , which signals for the _ net _ production of right - handed particles .",

    "this difference in the onsets comes from the difference in the rates . in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] we showed the analytically estimated rates ( by the dotted line ) using the formula in ref .",
    "@xcite with a common offset @xmath175 .",
    "the onset for @xmath31 is more delayed than that for @xmath163 since its rate @xmath179 is smaller .",
    "finally we briefly comment on the sensitivity when we change the box size , i.e. , the infrared extrapolation .",
    "we kept the lattice spacing ( and so @xmath116 ) and changed the lattice size to find that there is a subtle feature in the scaling behavior .",
    "since we need to go far into technical details to address this problem , we will leave it for another publication that will be focused on the lattice formulation and the systematic checks of the lattice - size dependence .",
    "we formulated the production of particles and anti - particles and checked its validity by looking for a right - handed particle excess on @xmath0-odd backgrounds .",
    "we limited our main concern to the cme current at present , but this type of the calculation should be applicable for a wider range of physical problems .",
    "for example , the ( pair ) particle creation at the horizon of the acoustic blackhole ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a pedagogical article ) attracts attention , and it would be feasible to combine it with @xmath0-odd ( or @xmath180 irreversible ) background effects , for which we can apply our method . of course ,",
    "as mentioned in the beginning , possible applications should cover problems of sphaleron - like transitional processes in the electroweak and the strong interactions on top of arbitrary gauge fields including non - topological ones .",
    "here we emphasize the impact of the agreement between our numerical results and the analytical expressions .",
    "it is very non - trivial that a direct evaluation of the current according to eq",
    ".   could be consistent with the quantum anomaly .",
    "also we emphasize the importance of real - time character of the chiral magnetic current generation . the physical interpretation and the theoretical estimate of @xmath15 are quite problematic and sometimes misleading in the literature .",
    "our successful simulation is the first step toward a realistic simulation in experimental setups without @xmath15 in the system .    in this kind of approach",
    "to solve the equation of motion , the anomaly arises from the infrared singularity around @xmath102 .",
    "the major part of the discretization error might be attributed to underestimating the singular contributions with coarse mesh .",
    "this implies that there may be a hybrid way to extract the singular terms analytically and to calculate non - singular parts numerically  @xcite .",
    "this would reduce the lattice - size dependence and we can make theoretical estimates with improved reliability . though we have confirmed that our cme current is close to the one in the continuum limit , it would be worth developing such a hybrid algorithm .",
    "another direction for the improvement is to include back - reaction from gauge fluctuations .",
    "once the back - reaction is taken into consideration , it would capture the effect of the chiral plasma instability  @xcite .",
    "these are works under progress  @xcite .",
