    "several air shower experiments like hires  @xcite , the pierre auger observatory  @xcite , and telescope array  @xcite , are using the fluorescence technique for detecting extensive air showers ( eas ) induced by ultra - high energy cosmic rays . measuring the fluorescence light that nitrogen molecules emit after being excited by charged particles of eas is currently the most direct method for determining the energy of eas in a model - independent way .",
    "a thorough understanding of the light emission process is necessary to obtain the primary energy of eas with high precision .    in this paper , we extend our previous model calculation for the fluorescence light emission  @xcite by including the latest results on input parameters and their temperature dependence as obtained in laboratory measurements . for the reconstruction of air shower events ,",
    "the light emission has to be known in dependence on altitude in the earth s atmosphere at which the shower is observed . up to now",
    ", the altitude dependence has been considered by including air density profiles and collisional quenching of nitrogen - nitrogen and nitrogen - oxygen molecules as described by kinetic gas theory .",
    "the cross - sections for collisional quenching were taken to be temperature independent . however , the cross - sections describing collisional quenching are known to be temperature - dependent  @xcite .",
    "grn and schopper  @xcite found a decreasing collisional quenching cross - section with increasing temperature .",
    "recently , the airfly experiment has studied collisional quenching cross - sections in dependence on temperature  @xcite .",
    "these data are also included in the model calculations presented in this article .",
    "in addition we investigate the influence of water vapour on the fluorescence yield , using relative humidity measurements performed at the site of the auger detector in argentina .",
    "following the mathematical description in  @xcite , the fluorescence yield ( number of photons of wavelength @xmath0 produced per meter track length ) is written as @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the fluorescence efficiency at wavelength @xmath0 without collisional quenching , @xmath3 is air pressure , @xmath4 is a reference pressure at which the mean life time of the radiative transition to any lower state @xmath5 is equal to that of collisional quenching @xmath6 .",
    "the index @xmath7 indicates the excitation level of a band system .",
    "the air density is given by @xmath8 and the energy deposited locally by a charged particle of an eas is @xmath9 .    assuming air to be a two - component gas , the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is given by @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 with the masses per mole for nitrogen @xmath13 and oxygen @xmath14 and the fractional part per volume @xmath15 of the two gas components .",
    "the temperature dependence of the collisional quenching cross - sections is parametrised as @xmath16 for example , in case of the airfly experiment , it is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the cross - sections have been measured for the bands at 313.6  nm ( 2p(2 - 1 ) ) , 337.1  nm ( 2p(0 - 0 ) ) , 353.7  nm ( 2p(1 - 2 ) ) , and 391.4  nm ( 1n(0 - 0 ) ) . in the calculations presented here , it is assumed that @xmath18 is the same for all bands within its band system . in the airfly experiment , @xmath18 have been measured for dry air and no differentiation has been made for nitrogen or oxygen . for fitting those data into the model calculation , it is assumed that these @xmath19-coefficients can be applied to the quenching cross - sections of both n - n and n - o collisions .",
    "an absolute calibration of the airfly experiment has not yet been published .",
    "therefore , the fluorescence efficiency @xmath20 has been set to 0.082% of the deposited energy , the value given by bunner  @xcite .",
    "the same normalisation for @xmath20 is used in the calculations of @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will show two model calculations based on airfly measurements . if the temperature dependence of the collisional quenching cross - sections is not considered , eq .",

    "additionally , a caveat has to be applied to this comparison : grn and schopper measured one @xmath19-coefficient for the entire wavelength range in pure nitrogen and not in air . for this simple comparison ,",
    "the value for n - n collisions has been used for the @xmath28 of air .",
    "however , the airfly result confirms a decreasing cross - section with increasing temperature and also the absolute scales of the two publications are in quite good agreement .",

    "the different temperature profiles lead to a varying strength of the influences of the temperature - dependent cross - sections . in general",

    "a former study has shown that varying atmospheric profiles influence the longitudinal shower development .",
    "it yields in slightly distorted profiles of the energy deposit of the air shower , which means an uncertainty of the energy reconstruction of the primary particle of less than 1%  @xcite .",

    "vapour quenching reduces the fluorescence yield mainly in the lower part of the atmosphere , compare with fig .",
