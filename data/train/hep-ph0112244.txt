    "during the last decade the development of quark - model based interactions for the hadronic force has led to nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) potentials that provide a fairly reliable description of the on - shell data .",
    "several models including quark - degrees of freedom have been used to study the @xmath0 interaction @xcite and also the baryon spectra @xcite . among them",
    ", the chiral quark cluster model is the only one that pursued a simultaneous understanding of different low - energy phenomena based on a unique quark - quark interaction .",
    "this model is able to provide a quantitative description of the @xmath0 scattering @xcite and bound state problems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , quark - model based @xmath0 interactions have not been often used to study few - body systems .",
    "there might be two different reasons for that .",
    "first of all , most of those interaction models for the two - nucleon system needed to be supplemented with meson - exchange potentials between the baryons to obtain a reasonable description of the experimental data @xcite , loosing in this way their quark - based character .",
    "secondly , other quark - model based interactions were primarily designed to describe the baryon spectra @xcite , but lead to unrealistic results when they are applied to the two - nucleon system @xcite .    in this work",
    "we want to perform a study of the triton bound state making use of a nonlocal @xmath0 potential fully derived from quark - quark interactions .",
    "the model has been previously utilized for investigations of three - body systems ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) , making more emphasis on the mass ordering of possible bound states of these systems than on the binding energy values@xcite . in the present work the full nonlocal @xmath0",
    "potential will be employed as it follows from the application of the resonating group method ( rgm ) formalism .",
    "this method allows , once the hilbert space for the six - body problem has been fixed , to treat the inter - cluster dynamics in an exact way .",
    "thereby , nonlocalities are generated , reflecting the internal structure of the nucleon , which translate into specific off - shell properties of the resulting @xmath0 potential .",
    "indeed the relevance and/or necessity of considering the nonlocal parts of @xmath0 potentials in realistic interactions is still under debate . over the past few years",
    "several studies have appeared in the literature which stress the potential importance of nonlocal effects for the quantitative understanding of few - body observables and , specifically , for the triton binding energy @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of these investigations @xcite explore only nonlocalities arising from the meson - exchange picture of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the nonlocalities generated in a quark - model derivation of baryonic potentials may play a relevant role for the case of the three - nucleon bound state .",
    "it has been argued that the assumptions associated with meson - exchange models sharply limit the nature of the off - shell properties of those potentials , once the on - shell matrix elements are constrained to fit the @xmath0 data @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to investigate the off - shell features of potentials derived from a quark - model . some preliminary studies in this direction have been done in ref .",
    "however , there only the short - range part of the interaction is obtained by means of quark - model techniques .",
    "the intermediate and long - range part is described by `` standard '' meson - exchange between baryons . accordingly",
    ", that work allows only very limited conclusions with regard to effects of the quark substructure .",
    "the triton binding energy is obtained from a faddeev calculation .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the standard five channel case ; i.e. we consider only the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath0 partial waves , those which provide the bulk contribution to the three - nucleon binding energy .",
    "the three - body faddeev equations will be solved in momentum space making use of separable finite - rank expansions of the two - body interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the basic quark - quark hamiltonian and we describe the method to obtain the rgm @xmath0 interaction . in section iii we provide details about the finite - rank expansions of the quark - model based potentials which enter in the faddeev calculations of the triton binding energy and we present results for the three - body system .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are provided in sec .",
    "in recent years a chiral quark cluster model for the @xmath0 interaction has been developed .",
    "this model has been widely described in the literature @xcite , therefore we will only briefly summarize here its most relevant aspects .",
    "it contains , as a consequence of chiral symmetry breaking , a pseudoscalar and a scalar exchange between constituent quarks coming from the lagrangian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a monopole form factor @xmath9^{1\\over2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] @xmath10 determines the scale of chiral symmetry breaking , being bound between 1 gev and 600 mev @xcite .",
    "the chiral coupling constant @xmath11 is chosen to reproduce the experimental @xmath12 coupling constant .",
    "> from the above lagrangian a pseudoscalar ( @xmath13 ) and a scalar ( @xmath14 ) potential between quarks can be easily derived in the non - relativistic approximation , @xmath15 @xmath16    using the range of values for @xmath10 given above yields a @xmath17 mass difference due to the pseudoscalar interaction between 150 and 200 mev .",
    "the rest of the mass difference , up to the experimental value , must have its origin on perturbative processes . in the present model ,",
    "this is taken into account through the one - gluon exchange potential @xcite , @xmath18     + { \\pi\\over 4 m_q^2 } { { [ \\vec{q}\\otimes\\vec{q}]^{(2)}\\cdot [ \\vec{\\sigma}_i\\otimes\\vec{\\sigma}_j]^{(2 ) } } \\over q^2 }   \\right \\},\\ ] ] where the @xmath19 s are the color gell - mann matrices and @xmath20 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "for the present study we make use of the nonlocal @xmath0 potential derived through a lippmann - schwinger formulation of the rgm equations in momentum space @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the rgm for a system of two baryons , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , needs the wave function of the two - baryon system constructed from the one - baryon wave functions .",
    "the two - baryon wave function can be written as :    @xmath23=   { \\cal a } [ \\chi(\\vec{p } ) \\phi_{b_1}(\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{b_1 } } )   \\phi_{b_2}(\\vec{p}_{\\xi_{b_2 } } )   \\chi_{b_1 b_2}^{st } \\xi_c [ 2 ^ 3 ] ] , \\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the antisymmetrizer of the six - quark system , @xmath25 is the relative wave - function of the two clusters , @xmath26 is the internal spatial wave function of the baryon @xmath21 , @xmath27 are the internal coordinates of the three quarks of baryon @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath28 denotes spin - isospin wave function of the two - baryon system coupled to spin ( @xmath14 ) and isospin ( @xmath29 ) , and , finally , @xmath30 $ ] is the product of two color singlets .",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the center of mass kinetic energy , @xmath34 the quark - quark interaction described above , and @xmath35 the constituent quark mass .    assuming the functional form    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is related to the size of the nucleon quark core , eq .",
    "( [ variations ] ) can be written in the following way , after the integration of the internal cluster degrees of freedom ,    @xmath38    @xmath39 is the direct rgm kernel and @xmath40 is the exchange rgm kernel , composed of three different terms    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the internal energy of the two - body system , @xmath43 is the kinetic energy exchange kernel , @xmath44 is the potential energy exchange kernel and @xmath45 is the exchange norm kernel . note that if we do not mind how @xmath39 and @xmath40 were derived microscopically , eq . ( [ als ] ) can be regarded as a general single channel equation of motion with including energy - dependent non - local potential .",
    "@xmath46 , which contains the direct rgm potential , and @xmath47 , which contains the exchange rgm potential coming from quark antisymmetry , constitute our energy - dependent nonlocal potential . in our case",
    "@xmath48 what makes our potential almost energy - independent , because the center of mass energy of the two - body system @xmath49 is much smaller than the internal energy @xmath42 .",
    "the potential yields a fairly good reproduction of the experimental data up to laboratory energies of 250 mev . for a correct description of the @xmath5 phase shift it is necessary to take into account the coupling to the @xmath50 @xmath51 channel @xcite , that provides an isospin - dependent mechanism generating the additional attraction in this channel .",
    "this is implemented in our calculation generalizing eq .",
    "( [ als ] ) to a coupled channel scheme .",
    "it implies a modification of eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) with an additional term which contains the @xmath52 coupling .",
    "the parameters used are summarized in table [ table1 ] . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we present the results for the low - energy scattering data and the deuteron properties of the present model together with values of some standard @xmath0 potentials @xcite and experimental data .",
    "it is known that a charge symmetry breaking term should be included in the interaction if one wants to reproduce those quantities simultaneously @xcite .",
    "this is taken into account by a slight modification of the chiral coupling constant to reproduce the deuteron and the low energy scattering parameters ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we also show , in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 phase shifts and the mixing parameter @xmath53 in comparison to results from phase - shift analyses @xcite .",
    "the triton binding energy is obtained by means of a faddeev calculation using the @xmath0 interaction described above .",
    "we perform a so - called five - channel calculation , i.e. , we use only the @xmath5 and @xmath54 @xmath0 partial waves as input .",
    "note that since in our model there is a coupling to the @xmath51 system , as explained above , a fully consistent calculation would require the inclusion of two more three - body channels .",
    "however , their contribution to the @xmath55 binding energy is known to be rather small @xcite and therefore we neglect them for simplicity reasons .    to solve the three - body faddeev equations in momentum space",
    "we first perform a separable finite - rank expansion of the @xmath56 sector utilizing the est method @xcite .",
    "such a technique has been extensively studied by one of the authors ( j.h . ) for various realistic @xmath0 potentials @xcite and specifically for a model that also includes a coupling to the @xmath51 system @xcite . in those works",
    "it was shown that , with a separable expansion of sufficiently high rank , reliable and accurate results on the three - body level can be achieved . in the present case it turned out that separable representations of rank 6  for @xmath57 and for @xmath54  are sufficient to get converged results .",
    "the set of energies used for the est separable representations are listed in table [ table3 ] .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for technical details on the expansion method .",
    "the quality of the separable expansion on the @xmath0 sector can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we show phase shifts for the original nonlocal potential and for the corresponding separable expansion . evidently , the phases are almost indistinguishable .    results for the triton are summarized in table iv . it is reassuring to see that",
    "the predicted triton binding energy is comparable to those obtained from conventional @xmath0 potentials , such as the bonn or nijmegen models .",
    "thus , our calculations show that quark model based @xmath0 interactions are definitely able to provide a realistic description of the triton . the results also give support to the use of such interaction model for further few - body calculations .",
    "one should not forget at this point that the number of free parameters is greatly reduced in quark - model based @xmath0 interactions like the present one .",
    "in addition , the parameters are strongly correlated by the requirement to obtain a reasonable description of the baryon spectrum .",
    "we have calculated the three - nucleon bound state problem utilizing a nonlocal @xmath0 potential derived from a basic quark - quark interaction .",
    "this potential was generated by means of the resonating group method so that nonlocalities resulting from the internal structure of the nucleon were preserved .",
    "the resulting triton binding energy is comparable to those obtained from conventional @xmath0 potentials .    in the calculation of the three - nucleon binding energy",
    "we have followed the traditional approach , namely solving the faddeev equations with nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "let us remark , however , that in a more fundamental approach one would impose consistency between the treatment of the two- and three - nucleon systems in terms of quark degrees of freedom . that , of course , would require the derivation and solution of corresponding three - nucleon rgm equations . in such a framework",
    "the quark structure of nucleons generates ( besides the consecutive two - nucleon interactions that are summed up by the faddeev equations ) also genuine three - body forces .",
    "these forces are of short - ranged nature and they could be significant for short - distance phenomena like the high - momentum - transfer part of the charge form factor of @xmath58he . indeed , there have been attempts to explore the effects of such three - body forces on the triton binding energy . in a simple model based on a single one - gluon exchange @xcite",
    "the three - body exchange kernels have been evaluated .",
    "an estimation provided in this reference suggests that those three - nucleon forces could yield additional binding in the order of 0.2 mev",
    ". if this is the case then those effects would be still small enough to guarantee that the approach we followed in our study is sufficiently accurate for an exploratory calculation . however , one has to keep in mind that the estimation in ref .",
    "@xcite was done only in perturbation theory , and by means of a zeroth order three - nucleon wave function with a series of fitted parameters .",
    "thus , for the future , a more refined and consistent treatment of the three - nucleon problem within the quark picture is certainly desirable in order to allow for reliable conclusions on this issue .",

    "entem for providing the codes used for the nonlocal interaction potential and for many useful comments .",
