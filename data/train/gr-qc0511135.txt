    "the question of how many images an observer at an event @xmath1 sees of a light source with worldline @xmath2 is equivalent to the question of how many past - pointing lightlike geodesics from @xmath1 to @xmath2 exist . in spacetimes with many symmetries",
    "this question can be addressed , in principle , by directly integrating the geodesic equation . in the spacetime around a non - rotating and uncharged black hole of mass @xmath5 , e.g. , which is described by the schwarzschild metric",
    ", all lightlike geodesics can be explicitly written in terms of elliptic integrals ; with the help of these explicit expressions , it is easy to verify that in the region outside the horizon , i.e. in the region wher @xmath6 , there are infinitely many past - pointing lightlike geodesics from any event @xmath1 to any integral curve of the killing vector field @xmath7 .",
    "this was demonstrated already in 1959 bei darwin @xcite .",
    "we may thus say that a schwarzschild black hole acts as a gravitational lens that produces infinitely many images of any static light source .",
    "however , already in the schwarzschild spacetime the problem becomes more difficult if we want to consider light sources which are not static , i.e. , worldlines @xmath2 which are not integral curves of @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    "we want to investigate this problem for the more general case of a charged and rotating black hole , which is described by the kerr - newman metric .",
    "more precisely , we want to demonstrate that in the domain of outer communication around a kerr - newman black hole , i.e. , in the domain outside of the outer horizon , there are infinitely many past - pointing lightlike geodesics from an unspecified event @xmath1 to an unspecified worldline @xmath2 , with as little restrictions on @xmath2 as possible",
    ". although the geodesic equation in the kerr - newman spacetime is completely integrable , the mathematical expressions are so involved that it is very difficult to achieve this goal by explicitly integrating the geodesic equation .",
    "therefore it is recommendable to use more indirect methods .",
    "such a method is provided by morse theory .",
    "quite generally , morse theory relates the number of solutions to a variational principle to the topology of the space of trial maps .",
    "here we refer to a special variant of morse theory , developed by uhlenbeck @xcite , which is based on a version of fermat s principle for a globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifold @xmath8 .",
    "the trial maps are the lightlike curves joining a point @xmath1 and a timelike curve @xmath2 in @xmath9 , and the solution curves of fermat s principle are the lightlike geodesics .",
    "if @xmath8 and @xmath2 satisfy additional conditions , the topology of the space of trial maps is determined by the topology of @xmath9 .",
    "uhlenbeck s work gives criteria that guarantee the existence of infinitely many past- or future - pointing lightlike geodesics from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we will apply her results to the domain of outer communication around a kerr - newman black hole which is , indeed , a globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifold .",
    "we will show that the criteria for having infinitely many past - pointing timelike geodesics from @xmath1 to @xmath2 are satisfied for every event @xmath1 and every timelike curve @xmath2 in this region , provided that the following three conditions are satisfied .",
    "first , @xmath2 must not have a past end - point ; it is obvious that we need a condition of this kind because otherwise it would be possible to choose for @xmath2 an arbitrarily short section of a worldline such that trivially the number of past - pointing lightlike geodesics from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is zero .",
    "second , @xmath2 must not intersect the caustic of the past light - cone of @xmath1 ; this excludes all cases where @xmath1 sees an extended image , such as an einstein ring , of @xmath2 .",
    "third , in the past the worldline @xmath2 must not go to the horizon or to infinity . under these ( very mild ) restrictions on the motion of the light source we will see that the kerr - newman black hole acts as a gravitational lens that produces infinitely many images .",
    "moreover , we will also show that all ( past - directed ) lightlike geodesics from @xmath1 to @xmath2 are confined to a certain spherical shell .",
    "for the characterization of this shell we will have to discuss a light - convexity property which turns out to be intimately related to the phenomenon of centrifugal(-plus - coriolis ) force reversal .",
    "this phenomenon has been discussed , first in spherically symmetric static and then in more general spacetimes , in several papers by marek abramowicz with various coauthors ; material which is of interest to us can be found , in particular , in abramowicz , carter and lasota @xcite , abramowicz @xcite and abramowicz , nurowski and wex @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : morse ] we summarize the morse - theoretical results we want to use .",
    "section [ sec : centrifugal ] is devoted to the notions of centrifugal and coriolis force in the kerr - newman spacetime ; in particular , we introduce a potential @xmath10 ( respectively @xmath11 ) that characterizes the sum of centrifugal and coriolis force with respect to co - rotating ( respectively counter - rotating ) observers whose velocity approaches the velocity of light . in section [ sec : imaging ] we discuss multiple imaging in the kerr - newman spacetime with the help of the morse theoretical result quoted in section [ sec : morse ] and with the help of the potential @xmath12 introduced in section [ sec : centrifugal ] .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review a morse - theoretical result that relates the number of lightlike geodesics between a point @xmath1 and a timelike curve @xmath2 in a globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifold to the topology of this manifold .",
    "this result was found by uhlenbeck @xcite and its relevance in view of gravitational lensing was discussed by mckenzie @xcite .",
    "uhlenbeck s work is based on a variational principle for lightlike geodesics ( `` fermat principle '' ) in a globally hyperbolic lorentzian manifold , and her main method of proof is to approximate trial paths by broken geodesics . with the help of infinite - dimensional hilbert manifold techniques giannoni , masiello , and piccione",
    "were able to rederive uhlenbeck s result @xcite and to generalize it to certain subsets - with - boundary of spacetimes that need not be globally hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "in contrast to uhlenbeck , they start out from a variational principle for lightlike geodesics that is not restricted to globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "( such a fermat principle for arbitrary general - relativistic spacetimes was first formulated by kovner @xcite ; the proof that the solution curves of kovner s variational principle are , indeed , precisely the lightlike geodesics was given by perlick @xcite ) .",
    "although for our purpose the original uhlenbeck result is sufficient , readers who are interested in technical details are encouraged to also consult the papers by giannoni , masiello , and piccione , in particular because in the uhlenbeck paper some of the proofs are not worked out in full detail .",
    "following uhlenbeck @xcite , we consider a 4-dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath8 that admits a foliation into smooth cauchy surfaces , i.e. , a globally hyperbolic spacetime .",
    "( for background material on globally hyperbolic spacetimes the reader may consult , e.g. , hawking and ellis @xcite .",
    "the fact that the original definition of global hyperbolicity is equivalent to the existence of a foliation into _ smooth _ cauchy surfaces was completely proven only recently by bernal and snchez @xcite . )",
    "then @xmath9 can be written as a product of a 3-dimensional manifold @xmath13 , which serves as the prototype for each cauchy surface , and a time - axis , @xmath14 moreover , this product can be chosen such that the metric @xmath15 orthogonally splits into a spatial and a temporal part , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the time coordinate given by projecting from @xmath18 onto the second factor , @xmath19 are coordinates on @xmath13 , and the summation convention is used for latin indices running from 1 to 3 .",
    "( we write ( [ eq : globhyp ] ) in terms of coordinates for notational convenience only .",
    "we do not want to presuppose that @xmath13 can be covered by a single coordinate system . )",
    "we interpret the direction of increasing @xmath17 as the future - direction on @xmath9 . again following uhlenbeck @xcite",
    ", we say that the splitting ( [ eq : globhyp ] ) satisfies the _ metric growth condition _ if for every compact subset of @xmath13 there is a function @xmath20 with @xmath21 such that for @xmath22 the inequality @xmath23 holds for all @xmath24 in the compact subset and for all @xmath25 , with a time - independent riemannian metric @xmath26 on @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to check that the metric growth condition assures that for every ( smooth ) curve @xmath27 \\longrightarrow s$ ] there is a function @xmath28 \\longrightarrow { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] with @xmath29 such that the curve @xmath30 \\longrightarrow m = s \\times { \\mathbb{r } } , s \\longmapsto",
    "\\lambda ( s ) = \\big ( \\alpha ( s ) , t ( s ) \\big)$ ] is past - pointing and lightlike . in particular",
    ", the metric growth condition assures that from each point @xmath1 in @xmath9 we can find a past - pointing lightlike curve to every timelike curve that is vertical with respect to the orthogonal splitting chosen . in this sense",
    ", the metric growth condition prohibits the existence of _ particle horizons _ , cf .",
    "uhlenbeck @xcite and mckenzie @xcite .",
    "please note that our formulation of the metric growth condition is the same as mckenzie s which differs from uhlenbeck s by interchanging future and past ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the reason is that uhlenbeck in her paper characterizes _ future - pointing _ lightlike geodesics from a point to a timelike curve whereas we , in view of gravitational lensing , are interested in _ past - pointing _ ones .",
    "for formulating uhlenbeck s result we have to assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of _ conjugate points _ and with the following facts ( see , e.g. , perlick @xcite ) .",
    "the totality of all conjugate points , along any lightlike geodesic issuing from a point @xmath1 into the past , makes up the _ caustic _ of the past light - cone of @xmath1 .",
    "a lightlike geodesic is said to have ( morse ) index @xmath3 if it has @xmath3 conjugate points in its interior ; here and in the following every conjugate point has to be counted with its multiplicity . for a lightlike geodesic with two end - points ,",
    "the index is always finite .",
    "it is our goal to estimate the number of past - pointing lightlike geodesics of index @xmath3 from a point @xmath1 to a timelike curve @xmath2 that does not meet the caustic of the past light - cone of @xmath1 .",
    "the latter condition is generically satisfied in the sense that , for any @xmath2 , the set of all points @xmath1 for which it is true is dense in @xmath9 .",
    "this condition makes sure that the past - pointing lightlike geodesics from @xmath1 to @xmath2 are countable , i.e. , it excludes gravitational lensing situations where the observer sees a continuum of images such as an einstein ring .    as another preparation ,",
    "we recall how the _ betti numbers _ @xmath32 of the _ loop space _ @xmath33 of a connected topological space @xmath9 are defined . as a realization of @xmath33 one",
    "may take the space of all continuous curves between any two fixed points in @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath3th betti number @xmath32 is formally defined as the dimension of the @xmath3-th homology space of @xmath33 with coefficients in a field @xmath34 .",
    "( for our purpose we may choose @xmath35 . ) roughly speaking , @xmath36 counts the connected components of @xmath33 and @xmath32 , for @xmath37 , counts those `` holes '' in @xmath33 that prevent a @xmath38sphere from being a boundary .",
    "if the reader is not familiar with betti numbers he or she may consult e.g. @xcite .",
    "after these preparations uhlenbeck s result that we want to use later in this paper can now be phrased in the following way .",
    "[ theo : uh ] _ ( uhlenbeck @xcite ) _ consider a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath8 that admits an orthogonal splitting @xmath39 satisfying the metric growth condition .",
    "fix a point @xmath40 and a smooth timelike curve @xmath41 which , in terms of the above - mentioned orthogonal splitting , takes the form @xmath42 , with a curve @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , assume that @xmath2 does not meet the caustic of the past light - cone of @xmath1 and that for some sequence @xmath44 with @xmath45 the sequence @xmath46 converges in @xmath13 . then the morse inequalities @xmath47 and the morse relation @xmath48 hold true , where @xmath49 denotes the number of past - pointing lightlike geodesics with index @xmath3 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , and @xmath32 denotes the @xmath3-th betti number of the loop space of @xmath9 .",
    "see uhlenbeck @xcite ,  4 and proposition 5.2 .",
    "please note that the convergence condition on @xmath50 is certainly satisfied if @xmath51 is confined to a compact subset of @xmath13 , i.e. , if @xmath2 stays in a spatially compact set .",
    "the sum on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : morserel ] ) is , by definition , the euler characteristic @xmath52 of the loop space of @xmath9 .",
    "hence , ( [ eq : morserel ] ) can also be written in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( respectively @xmath55 ) denotes the number of past - pointing lightlike geodesics with even ( respectively odd ) index from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "the betti numbers of the loop space of @xmath56 are , of course , determined by the topology of @xmath13 .",
    "three cases are to be distinguished .",
    "* case a * : @xmath9 is not simply connected .",
    "then the loop space of @xmath9 has infinitely many connected components , so @xmath57 . in this situation ( [ eq : morseineq ] )",

    "* case b * : @xmath9 is simply connected but not contractible to a point . then for all but finitely many @xmath59 we have @xmath60 .",
    "this was proven in a classical paper by serre @xcite , cf .",
    "mckenzie @xcite .",
    "in this situation ( [ eq : morseineq ] ) implies @xmath61 for all but finitely many @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , for almost every positive integer @xmath3 we can find a past - pointing lightlike geodesic from @xmath1 to @xmath2 with @xmath3 conjugate points in its interior .",
    "hence , there must be infinitely many past - pointing lightlike geodesics from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and the caustic of the past light - cone of @xmath1 must be complicated enough such that a past - pointing lightlike geodesic from @xmath1 can intersect it arbitrarily often .    * case c * : @xmath9 is contractible to a point .",
    "then the loop space of @xmath9 is contractible to a point , i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 . in this case ( [ eq :",
    "n+- ] ) takes the form @xmath65 which implies that the total number @xmath66 of past - pointing lightlike geodesics from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is ( infinite or ) odd .",
    "the domain of outer communication of a kerr - newman black hole has topology @xmath67 which is simply connected but not contractible to a point .",
    "so it is case b we are interested in when applying uhlenbeck s result to the kerr - newman spacetime .",
