    "it was long ago suggested that black holes should be treated as elementary particles @xcite , because both are parametrized only by their mass , angular momentum ( or spin ) and gauge charges .",
    "string theory has made a significant contribution towards putting this assertion on a firm basis .",
    "a common feature of black holes and elementary string states is that the degeneracy of states with a given mass increases with it .",
    "unfortunately , for elementary string states the logarithm of the degeneracy of states increases linearly with mass , whereas the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the black hole increases as the square of the mass .",
    "there are some cases in which the discrepancy between the two entropies can be removed appealing to the large renormalization of the mass of a black hole@xcite .",
    "there are , however , some particular states in string theory , called bps states , which do not receive any mass renormalization@xcite . whereas the logarithm of the degeneracy of bps states grows linearly with the mass , the area of the event horizon of a bps or extremal black hole actually vanishes .",
    "this motivates the argument@xcite that the entropy of an extremal black hole is not exactly equal to the area of the event horizon , but to the area of a surface close to the event horizon called `` stretched horizon '' . by carefully defining the location of the stretched horizon in a consistent way , the bekenstein - hawking formula for the black hole entropy can receive corrections in such a way that it correctly reproduces the logarithm of the density of elementary string states .",
    "the stretched horizon of a black hole is defined as the surface where the space - time curvature ( in the string metric ) becomes large .",
    "it is also the surface where the local unruh temperature for a stationary observer ( constant @xmath0 ) is the hagedorn temperature of the string theory .",
    "( the local unruh temperature becomes infinite at the event horizon ) .",
    "specifically , we define the stretched horizon as the surface where the scalar curvature @xmath1riemann@xmath2 is equal to one in planck s units .",
    "throughout , we shall be thinking of black holes as the classical description of a quantum object . the nature of this object is well approximated by ( classical ) general relativity far away from the horizon . at any rate",
    ", we should not expect the metric which solves einstein s equations to make any sense at distances to the origin smaller than the de broglie wavelength @xmath3 for a black hole of mass @xmath4 .",
    "since we are stringy , it is perhaps more appropriate to use veneziano s generalized uncertainty principle@xcite @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the string scale , @xmath7 is the string coupling constant and @xmath8 is planck s length .",
    "so , in planck units , the metric certainly is not expected to make any sense at radii smaller than @xmath9    where is the stretched horizon ?",
    "if the place where the curvature becomes big ( unity in planck units ) is inside the event horizon , then clearly there is no need to stretch it at all .",
    "similarly , if it falls at a radius smaller than @xmath10 , there is no point in talking about it .",
    "we are interested in finding under what circumstances the stretched horizon is a meaningful and useful concept for non - supersymmetric four - dimensional black holes . in other words , we must find when the stretched horizon is bigger than the event horizon and also bigger than @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) .",
    "consider the general solution to the einstein - maxwell equations @xmath12 \\sin^2 { \\theta } d{\\phi}^2 + \\frac { \\sigma}{\\delta } dr^2 + { \\sigma}{d{\\theta}}^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 using mathematica , we have computed the square of the riemann tensor for this solution , @xmath15 , and evaluated where it becomes one .    for the schwarszchild black hole ( @xmath16 ) the scalar curvature is simply @xmath17 whereby the stretched horizon radius is @xmath18 thus , the stretched horizon is always inside the event horizon , except for such ridiculously small masses that the de broglie wavelength is actually bigger than both .",
    "this continues to be the case for any charged static black hole : in fig .  1 we plot the critical mass ( in planck units ) at which the stretched horizon crosses the event horizon in terms of the charge @xmath19 . only for masses below the line",
    "is the stretched horizon bigger than the event horizon .",
    "the curve is essentially flat just below @xmath20 when it begins to grow .",
    "when @xmath19 reaches its extremal value @xmath21 , @xmath22 reaches 1.09 .",
    "so both for schwarzschild and for reissner - nordstrm black holes , the stretched horizon is useless .",
    "when @xmath23 , i.e. for rotating black holes , the situation does nt change much .",
    "the stretched horizon is again bigger than the event horizon only for small masses , but the critical mass below which the stretched horizon is relevant ( bigger than the event horizon ) is now a few times bigger and grows with @xmath24 .",
    "2 shows this critical mass when @xmath25 ( the plot was computed in the axial direction @xmath26 ) . in the extremal limit @xmath27 , the critical mass approaches the value @xmath28 corresponding to a stretched horizon radius of @xmath29 , which is @xmath30 times bigger than veneziano s wavelength and @xmath31 times bigger than de broglie s wavelength .    the charge , in the general kerr - newman case , remains rather irrelevant .",
    "in this work we have shown two things . first , that outside the event horizon of a static black hole , the curvature is always small .",
    "secondly , we have found numerically the critical mass above which the event horizon is bigger than the stretched horizon for a four dimensional black hole . in the extremal limit",
    ", it ranges from 1.09 when @xmath32 , to @xmath28 when @xmath25 .",
    "this results are in general consistent , since the temperature near the horizon of a classical black hole is always much smaller than the corresponding temperature of an extremal supersymmetric black hole . since the critical mass is of order unity in all cases this mean that the stretched horizon is not a very useful concept for four - dimensional non - supersymmetric black holes .",
    "physically , this indicates that only the massless modes of the string can be seen by an outside observer .",
