    "in less than a decade it was determined that not only do all massive galaxies harbor a supermassive black hole at their center @xcite , but also that the evolution of the galaxy is intrinsically linked to the growth of the central black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . however , the mechanism responsible for the co - evolution of a supermassive black hole and its host galaxy is still under investigation",
    ". as accreting supermassive black holes , generally referred to as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , can , over their lifetime , radiate an amount of energy comparable to the binding energy of their host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "galaxy wide processes can also affect the central supermassive black hole .",
    "for example , theoretical and observational evidence suggests that agn can be triggered by major mergers of massive gas rich galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or by secular processes not connected to major mergers , such as supernova winds , stellar bars , cold - flow accretion , interactions with other massive galaxies or satellite galaxies , or minor mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "simulations show that mergers of gas rich galaxies cause gas and dust to lose angular momentum and fall into the central regions of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting nuclear gas reservoir will be consumed by star formation in the host bulge and accretion flows onto the resident supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "according to the galaxy evolution model explored by @xcite , agn feedback will then evolve the agn host galaxy across the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) from the massive end of the blue cloud , through the green valley , and onto the red sequence ( but see schawinski et al .",
    "2009 and cardamone et al .",
    "secular processes , such as supernova explosions , stellar bars , minor mergers and interactions , will also release angular momentum from gas and dust leading to a similar reservoir of gas in the central region of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite mergers and secular mechanisms both leading to the accumulation of gas and dust deep in the galactic potential well , mergers and secular processes have very different galaxy wide effects and roles in galaxy evolution .",
    "major mergers are violent processes which , as with the antennae galaxies , can destroy galactic structure , causing the merger remnant to relax into a bulge - dominated system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "despite the systemic differences between galaxy evolution and agn activity due to major mergers and secular processes , it is difficult to observationally determine which mechanism is responsible for a given agn ; tidal tails are often faint , bulge - dominated systems can be re - triggered by secular processes , and the timescales for agn activity tend to be longer than the timescales for a merger remnant galaxy to dynamically relax @xcite .    despite the observational difficulties in determining how a particular agn has been triggered , there is observational evidence that major mergers are not the dominant agn triggering mechanism , at least not at @xmath1 @xmath2 2 . by determining the srsic indices of massive galaxies at @xmath1 = 23",
    ", @xcite found that @xmath365@xmath4 of agn hosts at this redshift range have srsic indices indicative of disky morphologies .",

    "when investigating agn in zcosmos , @xcite found that @xmath320@xmath4 of moderate luminosity agn at 0.25 @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath5 1.05 are in close pairs , and thus were likely triggered by galaxy interactions .",
    "@xcite argue that agn are as likely as quiescent galaxies to show signs of a recent merger at @xmath1 @xmath5 1 , and thus mergers can not be connected to agn activity at this redshift range .",
    "@xcite investigate the morphology of agn hosts and find that agn hosted by disk galaxies contribute @xmath325@xmath4 of the agn luminosity density at @xmath1 @xmath6 0.8 .",
    "they conclude , therefore , that a large fraction of @xmath1 @xmath3 1 agn are triggered by mechanisms unrelated to major mergers .",
    "@xcite found that when agn host galaxy colors are corrected for dust extinction , there is a bi - modality of agn host galaxy colors at @xmath1 @xmath3 1 , suggesting that there are two modes of agn activity at this redshift range . when modeling the agn population by considering mergers of massive dark matter halos , @xcite find that secular agn activity is necessary at @xmath1 @xmath5 0.5 to account for the observed agn population .",

    "the largest discrepancy between the mixed abhmf model and the observational constraints , is the hxlf at @xmath16 @xmath2 10@xmath99 erg s@xmath9 , specifically at @xmath1 = 0.6 . due to the tendril nature of cosmic structure , narrow",

    "the primary goal of this study is to investigate if it is necessary that agn be triggered by both mergers and secular processes or if a single mechanism can account for the entire agn population , not to determine the best fit agn light curve parameters .",

    "thus , agn hosted by disk dominated galaxies are a significant fraction of the agn population by @xmath1 @xmath3 1 , indicating that secular evolution is an important mode of galaxy evolution at this redshift .",

    "the findings of @xcite suggest that this fundamental change in agn activity at @xmath1 @xmath3 1.5 is due to cosmic downsizing . by studying agn black hole masses as a function of host galaxy morphology for agn observed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",

    "thus , the early type host galaxies in the sample of @xcite may host downsized versions of major merger triggered agn .",
    "thus , it appears that the dominance of major mergers in galaxy evolution began to decline by @xmath1 @xmath3 2 and is continuing to decline , in agreement with the theory of cosmic downsizing .",
    "meanwhile , the importance of secular evolution increased as the importance of major mergers decreased , until secular evolution became the dominate form of galaxy evolution at @xmath1 @xmath3 1.5 . since we are still early in the era of secularly dominated galaxy evolution , it is the more massive systems which are currently undergoing secularly triggered agn activity .",
    "cosmic downsizing would therefore predict that as the era of secular dominance continues , agn triggered through secular processes will become more common in lower mass systems .",
    "it is found that agn triggered by major mergers at @xmath1 @xmath5 4 have , on average , more massive central black holes than agn triggered by secular processes , at least at high redshift .",
    "locally , it appears that merger triggered agn and secularly triggered agn have similar black holes masses @xcite , necessitating that the abhmf of merger triggered agn evolves differently than the abhmf of secularly triggered agn .",

    "therefore , it is expected that the abhmf for agn triggered by secular processes will be less redshift dependent than the abhmf for merger triggered agn .",

    "<S> due to the co - evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies , understanding the mechanisms that trigger active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are imperative to understanding galaxy evolution and the formation of massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it is observationally difficult to determine the trigger of a given agn due to the difference between the agn lifetime and triggering timescales . here , </S>",
    "<S> we utilize agn population synthesis modeling to determine the importance of different agn triggering mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> an agn population model is computed by combining an observationally motivated agn triggering rate and a theoretical agn light curve . </S>",
    "<S> the free parameters of the agn light curve are constrained by minimizing a @xmath0 test with respect to the observed agn hard x - ray luminosity function . the observed black hole space density , agn number counts , and x - ray background spectrum are also considered as observational constraints . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that major mergers are not able to account for the entire agn population . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , non - merger processes , such as secular mechanisms , must also trigger agn . indeed , non - merger processes are the dominant agn triggering mechanism at @xmath1 @xmath2 11.5 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the shape and evolution of the black hole mass function of agn triggered by major mergers is intrinsically different from the shape and evolution of the black hole mass function of agn triggered by secular processes . </S>"
