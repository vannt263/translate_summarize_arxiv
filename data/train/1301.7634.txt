    "<S> this leads to the emission of a transient electric signal that constitutes an ses . </S>",
    "<S> several such signals within a short time are termed ses activity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the three lower channels in fig.[f1](b ) show three ses activities that preceded major earthquakes in western , southwestern and southern greece , respectively , as depicted in the map of fig.[f1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( only for earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or larger the ses activities are publicized , see p.102 of ref.@xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for the sake of comparison , the upper channel in fig.[f1](b ) shows a recent ses activity initiated on 8 january 2013 at a station labelled lam in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1](a ) in central greece ( cf . on 4 june 2013 an @xmath394.3 earthquake occurred at 37.98@xmath40n24.01@xmath40e , i.e. , around 20 km e of athens ( ath ) , which is consistent with the earlier finding@xcite in 1999 that lam station is sensitive to seismic areas close to ath . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis , which was made by following ref.@xcite , continued after this earthquake and showed the following results : the probability prob@xmath41 of the @xmath1 values of seismicity in the area @xmath42 maximized at @xmath43 on 11 & 12 june 2013 exhibiting magnitude threshold invariance for magnitudes in the range @xmath44 to 2.6 , see fig.[flam ] , although the completeness of the seismic catalog for such small magnitude thresholds is unclear . </S>",
    "<S> these results seem to suggest that the system approaches the critical point and conforms with the fact that a sequence of additional ses activities were recorded at lam from 31 march to 11 april 2013 , see also refs.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the following important fact has just been identified @xcite : at the initiation of an ses activity , which usually occurs a few months ( with an upper limit of around 5 months ) before a major eq , a clearly detectable change in seismicity appears , manifested by a minimum @xmath30 in the fluctuations of the order parameter of seismicity . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the case that geoelectrical data are lacking , once we identify the date of @xmath30 ( by analyzing solely seismic data ) this reveals also the date of an ses activity that would have been recorded .        </S>",

    "<S> an inspection of these results lead to the @xmath30 values inserted in table [ tab1 ] : in five out of the six mainshocks we find values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 that appear 1 to 5 months before mainshocks . in these five cases @xmath46 </S>",

    "<S> we note that the key criterion to distinguish the true precursory @xmath30 from the non precursory ones is the following @xcite : the minimum should be followed ( before the occurrence of the mainshock ) by a period during which the exponent @xmath59 of the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite -calculated for a length @xmath21=300 events in the magnitude time series- reaches a minimum @xmath60 slightly smaller than 0.5 ( thus , indicating anticorrelated behavior , but close to random ) and then @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this inequality means that when the system approaches closer to the critical point -which is the case when considering @xmath21=200 events compared to @xmath21=300 events- the fluctuations of the order parameter become more intense .    </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed to the investigation of eq.([eq1 ] ) in the case of seismicity and analyze the statistical distribution of the experimentally determined @xmath62 for @xmath57 or 300 , which is clearly path depended . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath62 can be considered as an entropic measure ( see appendix ) , but its sign is by definition always positive . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to apply eq.([eq1 ] ) , we need to define a threshold value @xmath63 above which the entropy production may be considered positive whereas when below negative . for this reason , we employ the relation @xmath64,\\ ] ] which results from eq.([eq1 ] ) when considering @xmath65 and experimentally determine @xmath66 by using bins of width @xmath670.01 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] depicts the natural logarithm of the left hand side of eq.([neweq ] ) as a function of @xmath68 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in each case </S>",
    "<S> , the threshold @xmath63 is the one that maximizes the linear correlation coefficient ( pearson s ) @xmath69 , thus pointing@xcite to optimal linearity . </S>",
    "<S> we find the threshold values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the relative ` time - scale ' @xmath72 , which corresponds to the slope of fig.[fig3 ] , lies in the range 40.6 to 48.3 , which is comparable with a scale of the order of @xmath7340 sequential events used in the calculation of @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare the aforementioned threshold values @xmath70 and @xmath71 with the @xmath30 values identified before each mainshock in table [ tab1 ] . we find that except one mainshock , i.e. , the mendocino eq in 1994 , the other four mainshocks ( including the strongest in table [ tab1 ] ) led to @xmath46 and @xmath45 values that are _ lower _ than @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in summary , it may be considered that once the natural time analysis leads to an identification of precursory minima ( i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath45 ) that are _ lower _ compared to the threshold @xmath63 values determined from the combined use of natural time analysis with the fluctuation theorem , a forthcoming major eq is likely to occur . </S>"
