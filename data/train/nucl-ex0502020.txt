    "the method of coulomb dissociation ( cd ) was developed in the pioneering work of baur , bertulani and rebel @xcite and has been applied to the case of the cd of 8 @xcite .",
    "these data were analyzed with a remarkable success using only first order coulomb interaction that includes only e1 contribution .",
    "indeed early attempts to refute this analysis by introducing a non - negligible e2 contribution were shown @xcite to arise from a misunderstanding of the riken1 data ; hereafter all collaborative experiments are identified by the location of the laboratory where they were performed .",
    "later claims for evidence by the msu group @xcite of non - negligible e2 contribution in inclusive measurement of an asymmetry , were not confirmed in a recent exclusive measurement of a similar asymmetry by the gsi2 collaboration @xcite .",
    "it was then a great surprise to learn in a recent physical review letter by esbensen , bertsch and snover @xcite that higher order terms and an e2 contribution are an important correction to the riken2 data @xcite .",
    "they quote in their prl paper @xcite statements from the seattle group @xcite and indeed the prl paper is based on these claims @xcite .",

    "we first note that excluding the region of the 632 kev resonance is possibly relevant ( but not necessary ) for direct capture ( dc ) data , but in cd data the contribution of that state is reduced ( by a factor of @xmath1 ) and is negligible . for the riken kinematics",
    "it is in fact smaller than the quoted error bar .",
    "the gsi cd data are quoted with that small contribution already removed and there is no reason to exclude a certain energy region to determine the slope of cd data .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the b - slope parameter extracted from both dc and cd data in the energy range of 300 - 1400 kev . for the dc data we exclude the same energy region @xcite due to 632 kev resonance and",

    "all so obtained fits have an acceptable  close to unity .",

    "1 , where we also include three dc data points that were omitted by the seattle group @xcite , as we discuss below .",

    "for example from fig .",
    "4 of the gsi2 paper @xcite it is clear that the central value of the slope of the riken2 data is smaller than the central value of the gsi1 data @xcite , but they are plotted by the seattle group in fig .",
    "19 with almost the same central value .",
    "we can not explain the origin of this simple mistake of the seattle group @xcite , which in of itself might be of no consequence , except for its relevance for the newly published prl paper @xcite as we discuss below .",
    "very recently it was also suggested @xcite that a reanalysis of the gsi2 data may yield a smaller slope for the gsi2 data , as also shown in fig .",
    "this latest analysis has yet to be scrutinized @xcite and published , none - the - less it is shown here since it was already presented in international meetings @xcite .",
    "but this result @xcite , as well as all other non published results , are not included in the calculation of the average slope and extrapolated  17 values of cd data .",
    "the published riken2 @xcite , gsi1@xcite , gsi2 @xcite , and msu data @xcite , yield a 1/@xmath2 weighted average for the `` b - slope parameter '' , b = 0.51 0.06 @xmath0 with = 1.1 . with a central value that is slightly smaller than quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , b = 0.55 0.08 and = 0.2 .",
    "the quoted small  is due to the wrong value used for the riken2 data in ref .",

    "19 are the correct ones .    in the same figure",
    "the seattle group suggests that a remarkable agreement exists between measured b - slope parameters of dc data @xcite .",

    "19 @xcite does not include all available data .",

    "it is well known that the `` old '' data on dc 7pg reaction @xcite exhibit major systematic disagreements .",
    "but the situation is not improved with `` modern '' data on dc @xcite .",
    "the data of the orsay group @xcite and bochum group @xcite do not agree with that of the seattle group @xcite and weizmann group @xcite .",
    "the disagreement is by as much as five sigma and there is not a single measured data point of the bochum group that agrees with a data point measured by the seattle group .",
    "most disturbing is the disagreement of the b - slope parameter extracted from the two `` modern '' high precision measurements of the seattle @xcite and weizmann @xcite groups , shown in fig .",
    "19 of @xcite as well as in fig . 1 of this paper . from fig .",
    "19 of @xcite it is clear that the b - slope parameter of the orsay @xcite , seattle @xcite and weizmann @xcite data do not have overlapping error bars .",
    "as we show below the , disagreement between the slope parameters is in fact more significant .",
    "the slightly better agreement between `` modern '' dc data is an artifact of the parametrization used by the seattle group .",
    "the large systematical disagreement between dc data can not be handled algebraically to extract a meaningful average slope .",
    "for example the slopes of the orsay @xcite , seattle @xcite and weizmann @xcite shown in fig .",
    "19 @xcite can not be all true if the error bars shown in fig .",
    "19 @xcite are correct .",
    "none - the - less it has been customary to artificially enlarge the error bars by multiplying it by the square root of , so as to make data with systematical differences appear as if it is statistically distributed .",
    "using such a procedure for all published dc data @xcite and the be1 and be3 data sets of the seattle group @xcite we extract a @xmath3 weighted average b - slope parameter , b = 0.38 0.02 @xmath0 with = 1.8 . taking into account the bad",
    "as discussed above , we obtain b = 0.38 0.03 @xmath0 as compared to b = 0.311 0.014 @xmath0 and = 1.9 , quoted by the seattle group .",
    "we conclude that the b - slope parameter can not be extracted from dc data with the ( impressive ) accuracy of 4.5% @xcite , unless one excludes some of the dc measurements discussed above .",
    "an error which is approximately a factor of 2 larger seems like a more reasonable choice .",
    "also a difference of the extracted b - slope parameter of 0.25 @xmath0 quoted by the seattle group @xcite is not confirmed in this analysis where we find a difference which is approximately a factor 2 smaller .",
    "the so obtained average b - slope parameters in cd , b = 0.51 0.06 @xmath0 , differs by only 1.9 sigma from that extracted for dc data , b = 0.38 0.03 @xmath0 , and can hardly be characterized as significant .",
    "this slight difference is particularly negligible in view of the substantial systematical disagreement among individual data sets measured in dc experiments .",
    "furthermore , it should not be considered sufficient to motivate new theoretical investigation or for that matter a publication in the prestigious journal of the physical review letters .",
    "as we show below the actual differences of measured slopes are even smaller .",
    "we now demonstrate that the parametrization s = a(1 + be ) used by the seattle group @xcite has no physical justification .",
    "we refer the reader to baye s seminal paper @xcite on the theory of dc where we find that for an external capture reaction ( and only when the conditions for an external capture reaction are satisfied , i.e. below 100 kev ) :    = @xmath4 = = @xmath5 $ ] = ( equ 1 ) +   + @xmath6 = @xmath7 ( equ 2 ) +   + and , + @xmath8 = @xmath9 $ ] ( equ 3 ) +    equation 1 - 3 were derived for external capture and are correct only when the conditions for external capture are met .",
    "specifically the value of @xmath8 is explicitly negative as predicted for energies below 100 kev . in such a case the logarithmic derivative s/s(0 )",
    "is shown to be an invariant @xcite .    at energies above 300 kev",
    "the observed slope are manifestly positive . for higher energies one must add higher orders beyond the linear term used in equ 1 , so as to turn the sign of the slope from negative to positive .",
    "for example the taylor expansion of the theoretical curve predicted by descouvemont and baye @xcite can not be truncated below third order to yield a reasonable representation of the predicted curve at all energies up to 1.5 mev . clearly at energies above 300 kev",
    "the truncation of the taylor expansion to a linear term , leads to unphysical expansion .",
    "furthermore , as we show in fig .",
    "2 the slope of the d - wave component is essentially constant as a function of energy @xcite ( approximately + 10 ev - b / mev ) , but the slope of the s - wave component varies with energy between approximately -20 ev - b / mev at zero energy to approximately -3 ev - b / mev at higher energies . the overall slope ( s = ds / de ) is a sum of the two components which is energy dependent . at very low energies",
    "the s - wave negative slope is dominant and is almost constant hence the linear truncation as in equ .",
    "1 . at energies above 500 kev the d - wave slope dominates and the variation of the s - wave slope is small leading to almost constant positive slope . at high energies the linear dependent of the s - factor with a positive slope is an artifact of the d / s ratio . but the over all slope at higher energies is dependent on the low energy cut of the data .",
    "in particular the fit parameters `` a '' used in @xcite is most sensitive to the choice of the low energy cutoff of the data between 300 and 500 kev , and the so - called scale independent b - slope parameter varies due to the selected range of data and not due to the physical slope ( s ) .    in equ .",
    "1 the over all normalization factor s(0 ) is directly related to the astrophysical cross section factor at zero energy , as well as the anc of the physical wave function @xcite . but the fit parameter `` a '' used by the seattle group @xcite has no physical meaning and is not directly related to the anc or the spectroscopic factor .",
    "furthermore , the observed positive slope ( s = ds / de ) of the cross section factor at energies above 500 kev is directly related to the ( model dependent ) d - wave contribution designated by d / s ratio @xcite .",
    "it is self evident that the d / s ratio is independent of s(0 ) , since both d and s components are proportional to the same anc @xcite .",
    "hence it is clear that at energies above 300 kev the slope ( s ) is * not * directly related to the over all normalization s(0 ) and the so called `` scale independent slope ( b ) '' defined by the seattle group @xcite has no physical justification .",
    "the s and d wave contributions calculated by jennings _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and with an increased d / s(0 ) = 8.5% value.,width=480 ]    to illustrate this point we show in fig .",
    "2 the s and d waves contributions calculated by jennings _ et al . _ @xcite . in the same figure",
    "we show the predicted s - factor with @xmath10 that is increased from 1.3 ev - b @xcite to 1.7 ev - b , which is certainly within the limit of accuracy of theoretical predictions . this yield a very insignificant ( 1.8% ) change of s(0 ) but a very significant change ( @xmath11 25% ) of the observed slope ( s ) above 300 kev .",
    "this schematic model most vividly demonstrates the fact that the parametrization s = a(1+be ) has no physical justification nor does the assumption that s/s(0 ) above 300 kev is an invariant .",
    "we add that a knowledge of the d - wave component at measured energies ( e.g. above 300 kev ) is essential for extrapolating  17 .",
    "for example at 500 kev the d - wave contribution amounts to 30% of the measured 17 and above 1,150 kev it is dominant . at zero energy ,",
    "on the other hand , the d - wave contribution is predicted to be small ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus in order to accurately extrapolate 17 to zero energies one must remove the d - wave contribution from measured 17 , as has been emphasized long ago by robertson @xcite .",
    "this so far has been done by means of theoretical estimate of the d - wave component and a chi - square fit of data by the predicted s + d wave components .",
    "but currently there is no direct way to test the validity of the model dependent prediction of the d - wave component .",
    "in fact the slope ( s ) seems thus far the only way to determine the d - wave contribution . as we show below the slope",
    "has not been measured with high accuracy and large discrepancies still exist between measured dc data .",
    "indeed the ill defined theoretical d / s ratio leads to an uncertainty of the extrapolation .",
    "other theoretical issues were also discussed by descouvemnot and they yield an uncertainty of at least 6% @xcite , a factor of 2 larger than the theoretical uncertainty quoted by in ref . @xcite .",
    "the measured slopes ( s = ds / de ) of world data measured between 300 and 1400 kev , as discussed in the text . the range of `` average values '' is indicated and discussed in the text.,width=480 ]    for that reason we plot in fig .",
    "3 the extracted slope s = ds / de for data measured between 300 and 1400 kev , with the same exclusion of dc data due to 632 kev resonance between 450 and 850 kev , and correcting for the m1 contribution of that resonance above 850 kev as discussed in section ii . figure 3 includes all published data and the slope of the riken2 data is plotted correctly . in this figure",
    "we note a sharper disagreement between `` modern '' dc data .",
    "in particular we extract three different slopes values for the four `` modern '' experiments on dc : a bochum - orsay low value @xcite , an average of the three seattle results @xcite and the weizmann higher value .",
    "these three values of `` modern '' dc slopes do not exhibit overlapping error bars .",
    "in sharp contrast all four published cd slopes shown in fig .",
    "3 are in agreement within the quoted error bars .",
    "from these data we extract for cd data the 1/@xmath2 weighted average s = 7.9 1.0 ev - b / mev with = 0.5 and for dc data s = 6.7 0.5 ev - b / mev with = 1.5 , hence s = 6.7 0.6 ev - b / mev",
    ". clearly the average slope extracted in cd data agrees ( within 1.0 sigma ) with that extracted from dc data .",
    "this agreement is considerably better than observed between individual dc measurements , as we discuss above .",
    "we conclude that there is no significant disagreement between slopes extracted from cd and dc data .",
    "this removes the very raison detre for the recent prl paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this prl paper @xcite we find a substantial ( 50% ) correction of the b - slope parameter extracted for the riken2 data that is implied to be 0.25 @xmath0 . as we discuss above the b - slope parameter",
    "was computed incorrectly by the seattle group , as shown in their fig .",
    "19 @xcite . for the riken2 data b",
    "= 0.39 0.08 @xmath0 , and the said correction yields : b = 0.14 0.08 @xmath0 which is considerably ( more than a factor of 2 ) smaller than the observed central value for dc data , b = 0.38 0.03 @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that the corrections suggested by esbensen , bertsch and snover , in sharp contrast to the claim @xcite , in fact lead to a disagreement between the riken2 data and dc data , and are not relevant at least for the riken2 data , and in particular they once again confirm that the e2 correction is negligible .",
    "in fig . 20 of the seattle paper @xcite they show extracted  17 from cd using the extrapolation procedure of descouvemont and baye @xcite , and based on this analysis it is stated @xcite that `` the zero - energy extrapolated  17 values inferred from cd measurements are , on the average 10% lower than the mean of modern direct measurements '' .",
    "the extracted  17 shown in fig .",
    "20 @xcite are only from data measured at energies below 425 kev and the majority of cd data points that were measured above 425 kev were excluded in fig .",
    "20 @xcite .",
    "this arbitrary exclusion of ( cd ) data above 425 kev has no physical justification .",
    "for example as shown by descouvemont @xcite the theoretical error increases to approximately 5% at 500 kev and in fact it is slightly decreased up to approximately 1.0 mev , and there is no theoretical justification for excluding data between 500 kev and 1.0 mev . in dc measurements",
    "the well known contribution of the 632 kev resonance needs to be subtracted , but that is not the case for example in riken cd data .",
    "furthermore , as we discussed above , the slope of the data between 300 and 1,400 kev is essential for determining the d / s ratio and the extrapolation to zero energy . excluding data above 425 kev reduces our sensitivity for testing the various model prediction of the d / s ratio .    when including cd data measured only at energies below 425 one runs into a more serious systematical problem .",
    "namely , the relative energy measured in cd ( @xmath13 ) is determined mostly from the proton-@xmath14 relative angle ( @xmath15 ) . at small relative energies ( as well as at small scattering angles , @xmath16 ) plural scattering in the target are of major concern .",
    "these are estimated theoretically and are known to be inaccurate .",
    "the effect of plural scattering in the target is indeed known for practitioners in the field of cd and has been discussed on several occasions .",
    "it leads to a systematical uncertainty of the measured 17 of the order of 2 ev - b .",
    "furthermore , the yield of the cd of 8 arises from a convolution of the nuclear cross section which is rapidly dropping toward low energies , and the virtual photon flux that is rapidly increasing toward low energies .",
    "this generate a yield that is almost constant ( 20% ) at @xmath13 = 300 - 800 kev .",
    "note that over the same energy range the dc yield changes by almost a factor of 10 .",
    "thus when excluding the cd data above 425 kev , the seattle group excluded the data that were measured with the best accuracy and with smallest systematical uncertainty .",
    "this exclusion of `` the best energy region '' measured in cd experiment is a manifestation of their misunderstanding of the cd method .",
    "if in fact one insists on such a flawed analysis of cd data , one must estimate the systematic uncertainty due to this selection of data .",
    "this has not been done in the seattle re - analyses of cd data @xcite .",
    "instead we rely here on the original analyses of the authors . in fig .",
    "4 we show the  17 factors extracted by the original authors who performed the cd experiments .",
    "these results include all measured data points , and are consistently analyzed with the extrapolation procedure of descouvemont and baye @xcite .",
    "the potential model of typel @xcite was also used in the gsi2 paper , but the so quoted  17 are not shown in fig .",
    "4 .     measured  17 as originally published by the authors who performed the cd experiments .",
    "these analyses include all measured data points @xcite using the extrapolation procedure of descouvemont and baye @xcite .",
    "we also plot the msu data with the e2 correction ( @xmath17 ) @xcite added back to the quoted  17 , as discussed in the text .",
    "the range of  17 results from the measurements of dc by the seattle @xcite and weizmann groups @xcite is indicated.,width=480 ]    we note that the five experiments on the cd of 8 @xcite show a remarkably good agreement within the quoted error bars , in sharp contrast to the confusion that exists in `` old '' @xcite and `` modern '' dc results @xcite .",
    "the results of the riken - gsi experiments must be considered as a continuation of the same experiment ( essentially the same experiment repeated four times ) with an improved kinematical and experimental conditions .",
    "thus the four results can not all be assigned the same weight .",
    "we note that while these four results are consistent within the quoted error bar , they show a systematic trend of an increased  17 ( to approximately 20.7 ev - b ) , while the error bars are reduced . the msu result on the other hand includes a model dependent e2 correction ( @xmath17 ) deduced from inclusive experiments @xcite , which was not confirmed in a recent exclusive measurement of a similar asymmetry @xcite . when this e2 correction is added back to the quoted msu result @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , together with the published riken2 @xcite , gsi1 @xcite , and gsi2 @xcite results we obtain a 1/@xmath2 weighted average of  17 = 20.0 0.7 with = 0.5 , which is in excellent agreement with the measurement of the weizmann group @xcite and in agreement with the measurement of the seattle group @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the statements ( which were repeated in the literature ) on substantial differences between 17 data from dc and cd measurements as well as extracted  17 are based on misrepresentation of data , misunderstanding of theory and a biassed approach of the seattle group @xcite .",
    "quite to the contrary we find a good agreement among cd measurements as well as an agreement of the cd results with the two most recent high precision results of dc experiments . further attention must be given to an accurate measurement of the slope ( s ) and the d - wave contribution to 17 measured at energies above 300 kev so as to allow accurate extrapolation to zero energy .",
    "requests including a copy of fig .",
    "4 of @xcite sent to the lead author ( dr . snover ) to correct this mistake were ignored , as was a request to receive the numerical values of data and the resultant `` a '' and `` b '' fit parameters . a recent linear fit by dr .",
