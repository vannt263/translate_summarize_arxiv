    "matter is composed of atoms which , although they are of very different classes , contain the same basic constituents : the proton , the neutron and the electron . of these three , two ( the proton and the neutron ) are only in the nucleus and because of this they are usually called nucleones .",
    "the neutron is a particle with charge zero , mass in rest of @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite , and spin @xmath7 .",
    "the neutron is a fermion , which decays or disintegrates for weak interaction in : @xmath0 @xcite , that is to say , the neutron becomes a proton emitting an electron plus an antineutrino of the electron .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the discovery of the neutron was made in 1932 by james chadwick @xcite .",
    "the free neutron is unstable and this instability results in that the neutron decays .",
    "however , in the nuclei it can remain without disintegrating .",
    "this is due to the fact that inside the nucleus , the protons and neutrons are connected by the nuclear forces , that is to say , by means of a strong interaction .",
    "the process of beta decay of the neutron is : @xmath0 .",
    "the theory of fermi of beta decay is used currently , although with some changes in weak processes to low energy , now called the theory v - a . for weak processes to high energy ,",
    "the correct theory is the electroweak theory of weinberg , salam and glashow @xcite , of which the theory v - a is a limit .",
    "one of the important characteristics of the decay of the neutron is that this process has current interest in nuclear physics @xcite and in cosmological theories @xcite since it is necessary to have complete theoretical results of the total rate of decay and thus , more and more precise experimental results of the lifetime @xmath2 of the neutron @xcite .",
    "the total rate of decay of the neutron is an important quantity for its cosmological impact on the synthesis of light elements @xcite and because , combined with the asymmetry of the electron , it provides in the standard model a direct determination of the coupling constants vectorial semileptonic @xmath8 and axial - vector @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the mensurations of the beta decay of the neutron provide important information about the strong and electroweak interactions .",
    "the decay of the free neutron is distinguished among the beta decay , because ( i ) it is theoretically quite pure ( the theoretical uncertainties are small ) ; ( ii ) the free neutrons can produce abundantly without expensive accelerators , and the detectors of the products of decay of the neutron are also relatively economic .",
    "the experiments of the decay of the free neutron make possible the precise and exact determination of the following important parameters of the standard model of the elementary particles : the constants of coupling weak vector @xmath8 and axial - vector @xmath9 , and the elements @xmath10 of the matrix of kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) .",
    "the value of @xmath11 is important for the test of the conservation of the hypothesis of the vectorial current ; @xmath10 is necessary to prove the unitary nature of the matrix km ; the reason @xmath12 helps to understand the fundamental interaction of the first quarks generation .",
    "@xmath13 can be determined for diverse forms and independently of mensurations of the decay of the neutron , and the comparison of the several results of @xmath13 provides an important test of the phenomenological model v - a ( the approach to low energy of the part of the standard model of the weak interaction of the charged current ) .",
    "the precise value of @xmath13 is important for the calculation of cross sections of the weak hadronic interaction , for applications in astrophysics , cosmology big bang , solar physics and neutrinos detection ( see the articles @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are many extensions of the standard model that predict measured effects of deviations of the standard model in decays of the neutron .",
    "one of the most popular is the model with left - right symmetry , with the norm group @xmath14 and currents charged with right helicity @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to carry out an analysis of the decay of the free neutron , in the context from a model with left - right symmetry @xcite , for this we start from an extension of the electroweak model applied to the baryons decay @xcite .",
    "this model contains the parameter @xmath1 defined as parameter of left - right asymmetry , which measures the parity violation .",
    "we apply this theory to incorporate the right currents , for which we propose an amplitude whose leptonic part is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 for left currents and @xmath17 for right currents .",
    "we also consider the mass of the electron different from zero @xmath18 , the recoil of the proton and the difference of masses among the proton and the neutron @xmath19 .",
    "the central point of ours result is that we have considered an interaction point of four fermions , and we have considered the proton and the neutron as if they were simply point particles .",
    "the most realistic thing is to consider that the proton and the neutron possess structure which is coupled to the weak boson @xmath20 , and to express the transition amplitude in terms of several form factors whose structure is limited by the covariance of lorentz .",
    "however , this case goes beyond the purpose of this work and thus is not considered here .",
    "this work is structured in the following way : in section ii , we consider the model with left - right symmetry , which is the point of departure of this work .",
    "section iii contains our analytic calculations of the decay of the neutron , and finally , section iv contains our results and conclusions . an appendix is also included , which contains the calculations of the total rate of decay for the case when the mass of the electron is different from zero , that is , @xmath21 .",
    "in the theory of fermi v - a the transition amplitude for the beta decay of the neutron is given by the expression    @xmath22 [ \\bar u_e \\gamma_\\alpha(1-\\gamma_5)v_\\nu],\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are produced by the strong interaction of the proton and of the neutron .",
    "experimentally it is found that the coefficient @xmath11 of the vector it is @xmath25 and the coefficient @xmath26 of the axial - vector is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "although the experiments carried out up to now indicate in a definitive manner that the emitted neutrinos are of mainly negative helicity ( which is known as left currents ) , there is not a fundamental theoretical reason for the same happening to higher energy .",
    "the electroweak model takes as a fact that there are only neutrinos of negative helicity and , as it was commented previously , their limit to low energy is the theory v - a .",
    "other physicists extend the electroweak theory building a model with left - right symmetry @xcite , that is , incorporating neutrinos of positive helicity ( which is known as right currents ) .",
    "the focus that we use here to include right currents is exposed by r. huerta in the ref .",

    "the amplitude ( 2 ) is for the decay @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are baryons . using the notation : @xmath35 for the neutrino , @xmath36 for the electron and @xmath37 , @xmath38 for the baryons",

    "should be integrated will depend on the physical quantities wanted , as well as on the ease of carring out the integrations .",
    "the first aspect that we want is to calculate the spectrum of energy of the electron , reason for which we will integrate firstly with regard to the moment of the proton @xmath76 :    @xmath77    now we integrate with regard to the moment of the neutrino ; for this we use spherical coordinates , and from the energy - momentum relativist relationship , we have that    @xmath78    then    @xmath79    to integrate the eq .

( 27 ) is the parameter @xmath1 that , as we have already mentioned , gives us information on those effects of the right currents @xmath124 , and @xmath125 ( where @xmath126 and @xmath127 have been rejected because their contribution is very small ) which is the most important term of correction .",
    "the numeric value of this term is presented in the part corresponding to the results and conclusions .    an immediate consequence of the eq .",
    "( 27 ) is that we can calculate immediately the lifetime @xmath2 of the neutron , that is , the required time for a certain sample of particles or nuclei to disintegrate until decreasing by half .",
    "in this part we present our results and conclusions of the decay of the free neutron .",
    "firstly , we have the corresponding result for the spectrum of energy of the electrons that , as is known , during the beta disintegration , the energy spectra of the electrons are always continuous .    the physical meaning of the eq .",
    "( 23 ) , that corresponds to the spectrum of energy of the electrons , is that this expression determines the total number of electrons that leave with a certain energy ( or the total probability of emission of an electron ) .",
    "an important point here is to see the influence of the parameter of left - right asymmetry @xmath1 in the spectrum or distribution of energy of the electrons , thus , a group of figures for different values of this parameter is presented .",
    "1 corresponds to @xmath16 , that is to say , for left currents , fig .",
    "2 , for @xmath17 right currents , while in fig . 3 ,",
    "several curves for different values of the parameter of asymmetry @xmath1 are superimposed .    comparing these figures ,",
    "it is clear that the parameter of asymmetry @xmath128 does not modify the curve of energy distribution , and only drops or goes up depending on the value of @xmath1 , as is observed more clearly in fig . 3",
    "; but we consider that this parameter _ is _ important in the calculation of the lifetime of the neutron .",
    "another important result is the total rate of decay eq .",
    "this expression determines the total probability that the particle decays , and as we can see , it depends of the constant of fermi @xmath129 , of the parameter of left - right asymmetry @xmath1 , of @xmath130 that is originated by the strong interaction , and of @xmath131 .",
    "as it was already commented , the parameter @xmath128 does not alter the form of the spectrum of energy , but we believe that this does play an important role in the calculation of the lifetime of the neutron , since in the eq . ( 27 ) the factor @xmath132 appears , that whether @xmath133 would have a factor of 2 , that would be considerable for the numeric calculation of the lifetime , besides @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "now we present the calculation of the lifetime of the neutron      although this result is very far from the most recent experimental value about the lifetime of the neutron @xcite , this calculation illustrates the ease of determining the lifetime once the expression for the total rate of decay is obtained .",
    "furthermore , we stress the importance implied in determining more precise analytical expressions on the total rate of decay and as a consequence of the lifetime , which plays a central role in the theory of the weak interaction , since it provides a mensuration of the rate of the constants of coupling @xmath135 . on the other hand , to have a reliable value of the lifetime of the neutron is also of great importance in astrophysics in relation to the problem of the abundance of helium in the universe .        comparing our result with that corresponding to the radiative corrections @xcite , we find that both results are of the same order of magnitude and they coincide up to the fourth decimal digit , which implies that our result is good , since it compares an approach to first order with recoil of the proton and difference of masses @xmath19 , with a radiative correction .",
    "the other correction terms in the eq .",
    "( 27 ) have rejected their contribution since it is very small .",
    "this appendix contains the calculations corresponding to the total decay rate , for the case when the mass of the electron is different from zero , that is , @xmath21 which corresponds to a more complete analysis .",
