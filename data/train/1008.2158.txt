    "luminous supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) were established as a class by einstein observatory observations of roughly 30 sources in the magellanic clouds , milky way , and m31 @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of external galaxies have now discovered hundreds of soft x - ray sources with properties that both exemplify and extend the class of ssss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) . even though they are bright , with luminosities higher than @xmath0  ergs  s@xmath1 , we know of only a handful in the galaxy , because the radiation they emit is readily absorbed by the interstellar medium .",
    "in fact , the ssss used to define the class display little or no emission above @xmath2  kev .",
    "roughly a dozen ssss are known in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "some of these are associated with novae , and are clearly hot white dwarfs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in m31 , ssss",
    "have been shown to be associated with supernova remnants , novae , and active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the more mysterious component of the class is comprised of x - ray binaries , most with orbital periods of a day or less .",
    "a promising model for these sources is one in which their prodigious luminosities are produced by the nuclear burning of matter accreted by a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "nuclear burning should allow the white dwarf to retain accreted matter and increase in mass .",
    "binary ssss have therefore been suggested as progenitors of accretion - induced collapse @xcite and of type  ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "nuclear - burning white dwarfs in wider orbits are also expected .",
    "indeed , symbiotic binaries have been observed as ssss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    because it is difficult to detect ssss in the milky way , and the magellanic couds are too small to host a large population , it is important to search for ssss in external galaxies .",
    "the advent of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ has made such searches possible .",
    "hundreds of ssss have now been discovered , some in galaxies as far from us as the virgo cluster @xcite . as the numbers of ssss has increased ,",
    "we have begun to find evidence of sources that have properties different from those of the ssss that established the class . some ssss are hundreds of times more luminous than the eddington limit for a chandrasekhar - mass white dwarf .",
    "several of these ultraluminous supersoft sources are candidates for accreting black holes @xcite . in addition",
    ", the search for the softest sources has identified a class of sources that are significantly harder than ssss , yet also significantly softer than canonical x - ray sources .",
    "quasisoft x - ray sources have luminosities above @xmath0  ergs  s@xmath3 but emit few or no photons with energy above @xmath4 kev @xcite .",
    "some could be hot white dwarfs in which there is an additional hard component and/or which are highly absorbed .",
    "those fitting this model are good candidates for progenitors of type  ia supernovae , because they would likely correspond to the most massive nuclear - burning white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references ) .",
    "others are too hot to be white dwarfs and may correspond to either black holes of neutron stars .",
    "in this paper we report on a source ( r1 - 25 ) that has been observed to switch between sss and qss states @xcite .",
    "no such sources are known in the galaxy or magellanic clouds .",

    "the state changing source r1 - 25 has been reported on multiple times @xcite .",
    "it is located in the central region of m31 approximately @xmath6 from the nucleus .",
    "the coordinates of the source are ( j2000.0 ) ra = 00:42:47.90 , dec = + 41:15:49.99 ( see @xmath54 to see how it was calculated ) .",
    "this region of m31 has been well sampled over the past 11 years . in this paper",
    ", we searched the _",
    "archive for all public observations of r1 - 25 through june 2 , 2009 .",
    "the observations that covered the source are shown in table 1 and include 86 observations .",
    "r1 - 25 was detected in 45 observations ( 28 acis - i , 2 acis - s , and 15 hrc - i observations ) from august 8 , 2000 to march 11 , 2009 .",
    "we note that the source position was the same in all detections , and we are confident that r1 - 25 is one source ( see figure 1 ) . we supplemented the _",
    "chandra _ data with _",
    "swift _ observations of the region in 2009 . however , the source was off during the _ swift _ observations and are not included in this paper .",
    "we took photometry results from @xcite for observations listed in that paper .",
    "we photometered the recent acis data in the same manner as @xcite .",
    "we used ciao version 4.1.2 @xcite to analyze the recent data .",
    "for source detection , we used ciao tool wavdetect @xcite .",
    "we set the scales for wavdetect to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the chance detection threshold was set to 10@xmath11 .",
    "the source aperture size was defined as the @xmath12 elliptical source region computed by wavdetect .",
    "the background aperture was defined as an elliptical annulus around the source region .",
    "the annulus had radii of two and four times the source ellipse radius .",
    "since the source is not near any other x - ray sources , the background aperture size was suitable for all acis observations",
    ".    only photons between 0.1 - 7 kev were considered and the following bands were used to classify them : soft , 0.1 - 1.1 kev ; medium , 1.1 - 2 kev ; and hard , 2 - 7 kev .",
    "the counts in each band and the total for the source were computed as @xmath13 , and the uncertainty was computed as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 as the counts in the source aperture , @xmath16 as the source aperture area , @xmath17 as the counts in the background aperture , and @xmath18 as the background aperture area .",
    "the total count rate , as well as the rate in each band , were corrected by a vignetting factor .",
    "the vignetting factor was derived from the exposure map as the ratio between the local and the maximum map value .    for hrc - i observations",
    ", we used the ciao tool dmextract @xcite to extract raw counts in source and background apertures , as shown in figure 2 , and to compute net counts .",
    "we defined aperture sizes so that the source aperture encircled energy fraction was @xmath191 and the background aperture fraction 0 .",
    "we also used the ciao aprates @xcite tool to compute the background - marginalized posterior probability distribution for the source rates , assuming non - informative prior distributions for source and background rates @xcite .",
    "we note that the hrc data were not corrected for vignetting .",
    "thus , the rates are lower than the acis counterparts by @xmath20 or less .    for sources with low flux significance , defined as @xmath21",
    ", we used the posterior probability distributions to estimate the 3@xmath22 upper limits to the rate .",
    "the upper limits were calculated using aprates .",
    "the same method was applied to both hrc and acis observations to determine upper limits . for obsid 10552",

    "we could not calculate upper limits for this observation .",
    "table 2 shows the photometry results for r1 - 25 .",
    "the first column is the modified julian date ( mjd ) for each observation .",
    "the next three columns are the counts in the soft , medium , and hard bands , respectively .",
    "the fourth column is the total counts for acis observations ( in the energy range of 0.1 - 7 kev ) .",
    "the uncertainties are 1@xmath22 in magnitude and calculated using poisson statistics .",

    "the top panel shows the count rate in each band ( soft , medium , and hard ) vs. obsdate , and the middle panel shows the total counts ( in acis observations ) vs. obsdate .",
    "the top panel demonstrates that the relative count rates change over time for the source .",
    "the middle panel indicates that the source alternates between being dominated by soft and medium photons .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 3 is discussed in @xmath23",
    "we used the ciao tool _",
    "dmextract _ to create source spectra for all observations where more than 60 source counts were collected . these were obsids 1575 ( acis - s , 183 source counts ) , 4720 ( acis - i , 61 source counts ) , 4721 ( acis - i , 65 source counts ) , and 4722 ( acis - i , 62 source counts ) .",
    "source spectra were extracted from a circular region with radius 6 pixels centered on the source .",
    "associated background spectra were extracted from an annular region ( also centered on the source ) with inner and outer radii of 10 and 25 pixels , respectively .",
    "for all observations , we created spectral response files using the ciao tasks _ mkacisrmf _ and _ mkarf _ @xcite .",
    "we modeled the resulting spectra using the xspec package @xcite .",
    "since the number of source counts is rather small , we chose to fit the unbinned spectra using the _",
    "c_-statistic @xcite rather than the @xmath24 statistic , which has been shown to introduce a systematic bias in parameter estimation in low count rate spectra .",
    "one caveat in using the _",
    "c_-statistic is that the background is negligible within the source extraction region .",
    "this is definitely the case in our acis - i observations ( @xmath191 background count expected in the source region ) , and an acceptable approximation in the acis - s observation of r1 - 25 ( only 17 background counts ) .",
    "c_-statistic as implemented in xspec does not provide a measurement of the goodness of fit , but can be used to constrain parameter confidence intervals , which we have done here .",
    "we fit a simple absorbed blackbody model to each spectrum in the energy range 0.3 - 8.0 kev , using the wabs model for the interstellar absorption @xcite .",
    "none of the spectra had enough counts below 1 kev to place a tight constraint on the interstellar column density ( in several cases the fits were consistent with no absorption ) , so we fixed _",
    "n@xmath25 _ at two values representative of the range expected towards an x - ray source in m31 ( 1.1 @xmath26 10@xmath27 and 6.4 @xmath26 10@xmath27 @xmath28 ) .",
    "the lower limit was taken from @xcite .",
    "the upper limit is shown for completeness ; it is very unlikely that the source has such a large column density .",
    "the resulting parameter values and their 1 @xmath22 uncertainties are presented in table 3 .",
    "we note that our results for obsid 1575 ( we found @xmath29 kev @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 ) are consistent with those reported in @xcite ( they found that @xmath31 = 0.122 kev ) . examining the temperatures found for r1 - 25 , a clear increase in the later observations can be seen , independent of the choice of absorbing column . at the 90% confidence level ,",
    "the temperature found for the acis - s spectrum is @xmath190.1 kev lower than the acis - i values .",
    "the blackbody temperature returned by the model fitting is constrained primarily by the high energy cut off .",
    "although acis - i has poorer low energy sensitivity , the fact that significantly harder counts are detected in such short exposures indicates that the increase in model temperature is real and independent of the differences between the two acis instruments .    in order to assess the statistical significance of our observed state changes , we used the simulation capabilities of the spectral fitting package xspec @xcite . in observation 1575 ( a 38 ks acis - s observation ) , 183 counts were detected for the source and we derived two best fit thermal models ( depending on assumed _ n@xmath25 _ , see table 4 ) with @xmath31 = 0.08 or 0.13 kev . later , in observations 4720 , 4721 and 4722 ( three 4 ks acis - i observations )",
    ", approximately 60 counts were detected in each , and the derived temperatures were in the range 0.150.27 kev .",
    "we want to determine the likelihood that , given the differences in instrumental response and exposure time , the best fit model from obsid 1575 produces the observed counts distribution in obsids 47204722 .",
    "we used the fakeit command in xspec to simulate 1000 observations , using the best fit model from obsid 1575 as input , and the appropriate response files and exposure time for the location of r1 - 25 in each of the acis - i observations . for each simulation , we recorded the counts in each of the energy bands outlined in  2 , and then used the ensemble of simulations to determine the associated error .",
    "finally , we compared this to the observed counts distribution .",
    "our results are recorded in table 4 .",
    "it is clear that the softer best fit model found for observation 1575 can not account for the observed counts distribution in observations 47204722 : such a source is simply too soft to give rise to the required counts above 1 kev . the same is true when considering the opposite situation  the best fit models derived for the harder state would produce a much larger number of counts in the acis - s band than observed , primarily because of the long duration of that particular observation . looking at table 4 , the observed counts in all cases differ from the tested model by a significant margin ( up to 20@xmath22 ) .",
    "therefore , we can state with confidence that the source experienced a real transition from a softer state to a harder one .      for the majority of acis detections of r1 - 25 ,",
    "there were fewer than 60 total counts .",
    "we found that using a spectral fitting program was not a viable option for these observations .",
    "instead , we used heasarc tool pimms @xcite included in the ciao package to estimate the appropriate spectral models . for cycles",
    "_ chandra _ a01 and a02 , we had to create effective area maps , as pimms no longer provides support for these cycles .",
    "the maps were created by running ciao tool mkarf @xcite for on - axis sources in both cycles ( note , mkarf was not run on r1 - 25 , but for other x - ray sources that were on - axis ) .",
    "the process was completed for the acis - i , acis - s , and hrc - i instruments .",
    "effective area maps created by mkarf differ slightly from the default pimms maps because they are created for specific observations .",
    "however , the different effective area maps produce similar spectral estimates , which we discuss later in the section .",
    "the method we used is similar to the @xcite approach .",
    "the process compares the observed @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 to the same ratios calculated by pimms for different spectral models ( we call the pimms ratios @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) .",
    "if the pimms ratios are within the 1@xmath22 uncertainty range for all three of the observed ratios , the model is a match .",
    "we used the same set of inputs for all acis observations that detected the source .",
    "our xspec analysis suggested that black bodies fit the data well .",
    "so , we used a black body model to fit the data using pimms .",
    "the black body @xmath31 input was varied from 0.025 to 1.224 kev .",
    "we assumed an _",
    "_ = 1.1 @xmath26 @xmath39 @xmath28 .",
    "we input an unabsorbed x - ray flux ( 0.1 - 7 kev ) corresponding to l@xmath40 = @xmath41  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "this value was simply an initial guess for the l@xmath40 ; the guess was incorrect for the observations .",
    "however , we corrected the x - ray luminosity ( calling it the l@xmath42 ) using the ratio of the tcr and tcrp .",
    "that is :    @xmath43    table 5 shows an example of the pimms method for acis - s observation 1854 ( obsmjd 51922.4 ) .",
    "the first column is the @xmath31 ( in kev ) that was input . the next three columns show the ratios for the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the last column shows the value of l@xmath40 for each value of @xmath31 , and were calculated using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the ratios in the table were compared to the observed ones ( the values of @xmath31 that fit the observation are in bold in table 5 ) .",
    "the range for the observed ratios were :    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    we applied a second step to the method to reduce the range of temperatures that fit each observation .",
    "we broke the soft band down into smaller bins , as shown in table 6 , and followed the same procedure as above .",
    "that is , we compared the ratios of the observed values and those calculated by pimms for these smaller bins .",
    "this additional step significantly decreased the range of @xmath31 that fit each observation .",
    "for example , using just the first step for obsid 1854 ( see table 6 ) , there were three values of @xmath31 that fit ( 0.083 , 0.112 kev , 0.151 kev ) . after applying the second step",
    ", we were able to exclude the two higher values of @xmath31 .",
    "however , for many observations the @xmath31 range was still over 100 ev after applying the second step .",
    "as a test of the pimms method , we applied it to the four observations that were analyzed with xspec .",
    "table 7 shows a comparison of the fitting results from xspec and pimms for _",
    "n@xmath25 _ = 1.1 @xmath26 @xmath39@xmath28 .",
    "the first two columns are the observation i d and mjd .",
    "the third and fourth columns show the @xmath31 range determined by xspec and pimms , respectively .",
    "the two methods produce similar results , demonstrating the validity of our pimms estimation method .",
    "table 8 shows the results from the pimms method .",
    "the xspec results are shown in place of the pimms estimates for the four observations described in @xmath53.1 .",
    "the last two columns show the range of @xmath31 and l@xmath40 that fit each observation . for all observations",
    ", the minimum value of @xmath47 that fit corresponds to the maximum value of l@xmath40 .",
    "the table shows clear evidence for state change .",
    "this can be better seen in figure 4 , which graphically display the spectra for r1 - 25 .",
    "again , we used the xspec ( black symbols ) results instead of the those from pimms ( blue symbols ) for the four observations analyzed in @xmath53.1 .",
    "the plots show a change in both state and l@xmath40 for the source .",
    "the source is observed in a sss state ( at minimum @xmath31 @xmath30 100 ev ) , and changes to a qss state ( at maximum @xmath31 @xmath48 245 ) .",
    "the source also exhibits a change in l@xmath49 of @xmath191 magnitude .",
    "we note that , like the xspec results , increasing the _ n@xmath25 _ decreases the @xmath31 and increases the l@xmath40 that fit the data . however , as with the xspec results , the change of state observed in the source using the pimms method is seen at larger values of _ n@xmath25_.",
    "this implies that the state change is not dependent on the value of _",
    "n@xmath25 _ chosen .",
    "as a check of the default effective area maps used by pimms , we created effective area maps for several observations .",
    "the effective area maps were created for on - axis sources using mkarf .",
    "we then recalculated the ratios predicted by pimms using the new maps .",
    "the ratios calculated from the two methods differed by 0.01 at most .",
    "this difference leads to a small change ( at most 5 ev ) in the range of @xmath31 values that fit .",
    "this is a negligible change considering the inherent uncertainties associated with using pimms .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath31 range for most observations was @xmath19100 ev ( see table 8) .",
    "thus , there would still be evidence for state change if mkarf effective area maps were used instead of the default pimms maps .",
    "we used the pimms estimates to convert acis - s and hrc - i count rates to acis - i units ( see the last column of table 2 , as well as the bottom panel in figure 3 ) .",
    "this calculation is done to compare the results between _ chandra _ instruments .",
    "we choose acis - i units because most of the detections of the source were in this instrument .",
    "thus , the last two columns of table 2 show the same count rate for acis - i observations .    for acis - s detections of r1 - 25",
    ", we use pimms to convert the total count rate to acis - i units using the appropriate spectral models ( see table 8) .",
    "we ran pimms twice to determine the upper and lower bounds of the converted rate .",
    "to determine the upper bound , we input the following count rate : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the uncertainty in total count rate . the model used was the maximum value of @xmath31 determined to fit the observation . to determine the lower bound , we input : @xmath52 , using the minimum value of @xmath31 determined to fit the observation as the model . in both calculations",

    "hrc - i observations and acis - s non - detections of the source provided no spectral information . for these observations",
    ", we assumed a spectral model and then applied the same process as above to convert to an acis - i count rate .",
    "all observations in _ chandra _ cycles a01 , a02 , and a03 were converted assuming : @xmath53 kev @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath54 kev . for the rest",
    ", we determined the appropriate range of @xmath31 from the first acis detections before and after the observation .",
    "for example , hrc - i observation 7285 ( mjd 54052.3 ) detected the source .",
    "the first acis detection preceding it was obsid 7140 ( mjd 54002.8 ; @xmath55 kev @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath56 kev , see table 8) and the first after was obsid 7064 ( mjd 54073.9 ; @xmath29 kev @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath57 kev , see table 8) .",
    "we used the following range for @xmath31 for obsid 7285 : @xmath29 kev @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath56 kev .      using the method described in @xcite , we calculated the soft and hard color ratios for all r1 - 25 detections with 25 or more counts ( the results are shown in table 9 ) .",
    "the ratios were calculated using the following equations for each of the 12 observations in the table : @xmath58 @xmath59 the color ratios were used to construct a x - ray color - color plot in the same fashion as @xcite ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "each area of the plot corresponds to different types of x - ray sources .",
    "figure 5 further demonstrates the strange behavior of this source , as it has detections in very different locations on the graph .",
    "the location of r1 - 25 has been observed with the acs camera onboard _ hst _ ( see table 10 ) . in both cases , images are only available in the f435w filter ( approximately equal to the _ b _ filter in ground based systems ) .",
    "we have 4 observations aquired in the period 20042007 , so the data are useful for looking for transient or variable sources .",
    "only one _ chandra _ observation ( obsid 8183 ) was taken within a week of an acs observation ( j9ju06010 ) of the source .",
    "however , the source was not detected in obsid 8183 .",
    "all data were obtained using the wide field channel ( wfc ) , which has a @xmath60 @xmath26 @xmath60 field of view @xcite .",
    "each observation was carried out in the standard four pointing dither pattern @xcite .",
    "these individual images were then combined using the pyraf task multidrizzle @xcite , which also removes cosmic rays and corrects the geometrical distortion which results from the orientation of the acs with respect to the hst focal plane .",
    "we chose not to apply an automatic background subtraction in order to perform photometry , since there is a steep gradient in the diffuse light this close to the center of m31 making background estimation unreliable .",
    "finally , we utilized the ability of multidrizzle to resample the spatial scale of the image , resulting in a final pixel scale of @xmath61/pix .",
    "the world coordinate system ( wcs ) in hst images can be offset from standard reference frames by as much as one arcsecond @xcite . to improve the astrometry , we registered the final drizzled images to the wcs of the local group survey ( lgs ) images of m31 @xcite .",
    "stars common to both images were identified , and their centroid positions calculated using the iraf task imcentroid .",
    "we then used the task ccmap in iraf to update the wcs of the hst images .",
    "the final rms ( 1@xmath22 ) errors in the alignment were of order 0.006@xmath62 in ra , and 0.002@xmath62 in declination .",
    "we note that the rms errors on the alignment of the hst images to the wcs of the lgs survey were always smaller than 0.01@xmath62 ( which is smaller than one pixel in the rescaled images ) .",
    "we also aligned the deepest _ chandra _ observation ( obsid 1575 ) with the wcs of the lgs images using the same procedure applied to the hst images .",

    "the centroid position in the corrected wcs for the source is ra:00:42:47.90 , dec:+41:15:49.99 , with errors of 0.08@xmath62 ( ra ) and 0.07@xmath62 ( dec ) . to get the final positional error",
    ", we added the alignment and centroid errors in quadrature .",
    "the final ra error is 0.13@xmath62 and final dec error is 0.17@xmath62 ( these are 1@xmath22 errors ) .    since the wfc images cover such a large area and contain so many stars , we extracted subimages 1000 pixels on a side centered on our source of interest and performed photometry on those .",
    "we used the daophot ii and allstar routines @xcite to find and photometer stars in the images .",
    "stars suitable for calculating a point spread functions ( psfs ) were identified by hand to avoid problems due to crowding .",
    "the final measured counts for each star were converted first to count rate by dividing by the exposure time of each observation , and then to ab system magnitudes using the conversion factors in the acs users handbook @xcite .",
    "we show the final reduced image for the source in figure 6 , superimposed with the x - ray 3@xmath22 positional error ellipse .",
    "the ellipse is drawn using the 3@xmath22 ra error ( 0.39@xmath62 ) as the semi - major axis and the 3@xmath22 dec error ( 0.51@xmath62 ) as the semi - minor axis .",

    "the extinction in the f435w filter is 0.785 magnitudes .",
    "thus , the star s @xmath65 is between -0.80 and -0.98 in the four observations , assuming @xmath66 = 24.47 @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that , within the uncertainties , there is no evidence of variability in this object .",
    "although other sources are picked up by the daophot detection algorithm inside the error ellipse in some images , these additional detections can be accounted for by the longer exposure time , or are unreliable due to crowding .",
    "@xcite looked at the spectral energy distribution of 92 active galactic nuclei that had soft x - ray spectra .",
    "the agn they studied had comparable x - ray count rates to r1 - 25 . however , the agn were much brighter in the b band ( 14 @xmath30 @xmath67 @xmath30 18 ) than any source in figure 6 .",

    "we consider a number of physical models with the goal of uncovering the nature of the x - ray emitting source . in order for any model of r1 - 25 to be successful",
    ", it must be able to explain all of the observed features of the source .",
    "these features include the source s appearance as an sss - hr source in observation 1575 with acis - s , with kt @xmath19 130 ev and a 0.38 kev luminosity of 4 @xmath26 10@xmath70 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "we wish to emphasize once again that even though r1 - 25 had an effective temperature in excess of 100 ev when detected as an sss ( much higher than most ssss ) , it satisfied the strictest sss criterion as defined in @xcite .",
    "that is , the detection in observation 1575 ( when the source was an sss ) had no hard counts , medium counts consistent with zero , and a 3@xmath22 detection in the soft band .",
    "furthermore , the model must explain the subsequent detections of the source as a @xmath19250 ev source , _ with higher luminosity _ than in the soft state ( @xmath1910@xmath71 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "lastly , the model must be consistent with an optical counterpart with f435w magnitude fainter than @xmath1924.3 ( @xmath65 fainter than @xmath19 -1 ) .",

    "rx j0439.8 - 6809 , a white dwarf sss , has a @xmath65 @xmath19 2.7 , which is also consistent with the optical constraint on r1 - 25 .",
    "the following subsections outline white dwarf , neutron star and black hole models , and compare their features to the observed properties of r1 - 25 .",
    "white dwarfs that have recently experienced novae have temperatures and luminosities that can make them detectable as ssss .",
    "many ssss detected in m31 were recent novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) .",
    "when the white dwarf cools , some novae are detected as harder x - ray sources , but the x - ray luminosity is around @xmath72  ergs  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , novae in a supersoft state are detected with @xmath31 @xmath19 50 ev and l@xmath40 of @xmath73  ergs  s@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) .",
    "thus r1 - 25 , even in its softest state ( with kt @xmath19130 ev and l@xmath40 of 4 @xmath26 10@xmath70 erg s@xmath1 ) , is too hard to be consistent with the very soft emission detected in typical supersoft novae .",
    "also , the source is not consistent with the harder states of novae .",
    "that is r1 - 25 , even in its hardest state ( @xmath19250 ev and l@xmath40 of 1.1 @xmath26 10@xmath71 erg s@xmath1 ) is softer and more luminous than novae in their hardest states .",
    "moreover , the harder states of r1 - 25 are more luminous than the softer ones , in contradiction to what happens in novae",
    ". we therefore turn to models in which a white dwarf accretes matter at high rates .",
    "when a white dwarf accretes mass at a high enough rate that the incoming matter can experience nuclear burning , the white dwarf can appear as an sss . in this case , the source will not be in a hard state .",
    "the copious energy we receive from such sources is provided by nuclear burning , rather than accretion .",
    "the effective radii are comparable to the white dwarf radii , so the emission can be characterized by values of @xmath31 in the range of tens of ev for low - mass white dwarfs , and @xmath74 ev for white dwarfs approaching the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath75 ) . for each white dwarf mass , nuclear burning can occur only within a narrow range of accretion rates @xcite .",
    "these rates are very high : @xmath76 for a solar - mass white dwarf , ten times higher for a white dwarf with mass near @xmath75 @xcite . at such rates of infall , accretion alone produces luminosities in the range of @xmath77  ergs  s@xmath1 , typically a few percent of the total energy of the system .",
    "consider a case , when its accretion rate places a white dwarf near the lower end of the steady - burning region , or just below it . in this case",
    ", nuclear burning may be episodic . during and just after nuclear - burning episodes ,",
    "the emission is dominated by soft emission .",
    "as the white dwarf cools , however , it becomes less luminous and the emission is dominated by accretion . although at high rates of accretion , the emission is expected to be softer than typical for low - accretion - rate white dwarfs , such as cataclysmic variables , it can nevertheless be harder than typical of ssss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the source could appear to be quasisoft or hard .",
    "if the donor is a giant or a roche - lobe filling star in a circular orbit , the accretion rate should could continue to be high .",
    "the source will continue to be detected as a harder source .",
    "nuclear burning episodes occurring at intervals ranging from months to decades would make the source more luminous and detectable as an sss .",
    "the points made above about the quasi - steady nuclear burning white dwarf model are illustrated in figure 7 .",
    "the figure is a plot of @xmath31 vs. the logarithm of bolometric luminosity , log[l ] for various quasi - steady nuclear burning white dwarfs ( green points ) along with the r1 - 25 spectra ( black , blue , and red points ) .",
    "the solid and open black points represent the xspec spectral fits of r1 - 25 .",
    "the solid black points represent the fits where we assume l@xmath40 = l. the x - ray luminosity , however , is not equivalent to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we assume that the x - ray luminosity represents , at a minimum , a quarter of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "thus , we plot the open black circles which represent xspec fits assuming l@xmath40 = @xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "the solid blue points , which represent the spectral fits for observations with fewer counts ( spectra estimated using the pimms method described in @xmath53.2 ) , are included for completeness .",
    "they represent the pimms spectral estimates assuming l@xmath40 = l. the red points represent the pimms results assuming l@xmath40 = @xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "however , as noted in @xmath53.2 , these spectral fits are estimates .",
    "for this reason , we point out that the xspec results are more reliable .",
    "in fact , the error bars are so large for the pimms results that they cover most of the plot .",
    "the pimms uncertainties are excluded for this reason .",
    "the plot clearly indicates that the quasi - steady nuclear burning white dwarf model does not fit r1 - 25 , as the data are to hard and/or dim to fit the model .",
    "that is , no xspec points and only one of the pimms points fall in the range of quasi - steady nuclear burning .",
    "isolated neutron stars and neutron stars in quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ) have been observed with spectra in the sss or qss range , but they are typically 3 - 5 orders of magnitude less luminous than the `` classical '' ssss and qsss ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed , however , that the combination of gravitational and magnetic effects can cause neutron stars accreting near the eddington limit to produce sss - like spectra .",
    "in such cases , the luminosities and temperatures would give the accreting neutron stars the appearance of `` classical '' ssss .",
    "nevertheless , neutron - star models for ssss have received relatively little attention , perhaps because of the success of white dwarf models , coupled with what appeared to be the fine tuning required for a neutron star to achieve the appropriate effective radius .",
    "it is therefore worth noting that there is observational support for the idea that neutron stars can produce very soft spectra .",
    "@xcite discovered a transient pulsar in the small magellanic cloud that has an unpulsed , highly luminous ( near eddington ) soft @xmath80  ev ) component .",
    "if such a system is viewed from an angle at which the hard radiation is not detected , it would have the properties associated with the `` classical '' ssss first discovered in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "here we point out that the discovery of qsss provides reasons to revisit neutron star models .",
    "consider a neutron star producing near - eddington soft emission .",
    "if this emission emanates from a nearly spherical photosphere with radius equal to the alfven radius , then    @xmath81    in this expression , @xmath82 is the radius of the neutron star , @xmath83 is the value of magnetic field on the surface , and @xmath84 and @xmath79 represent the neutron star s mass and luminosity , respectively .",
    "an interesting feature of this expression is that there are ranges of reasonable values of the physical parameters in which the @xmath31 is in the range expected for ssss or qsss .",
    "furthermore , for a specific neutron star , the effective temperature depends on l which can change as the accretion rate changes .",
    "since changes in accretion rate are common , we may therefore expect the effective temperatures of some neutron stars to change . depending on the physical parameters",
    ", these changes could produce transitions from sss to qss states .",
    "another set of factors support neutron star models for some qsss and state - changing qsss .",
    "this is that , if there is luminous soft emission , there must also be a hard component generated by matter accreting , which is channeled onto the poles by the neutron star s strong magnetic field .",
    "the hard emission is likely to be beamed .",
    "this model therefore predicts that a large population of accreting neutron stars will contain some with a pulsed hard component .",
    "if this component is not the dominant one , then the neutron star may appear as a qss , even if emission from the alfven sphere is sss .",
    "the diagnostic for the neutron star model would be periodicity in the arrival times of the harder photons .",
    "figure 8 shows two plots of @xmath31 vs. log[l ] .",

    "each curve differs by a factor of ten in @xmath83 .",

    "the xspec points seem to follow the same trend as the curve , with some variation .",

    "it is important to note that if we can identify qsss and state changers in the milky way or in the magellanic clouds , then neutron star models are testable .",
    "the reason is that neutron stars produce pulsed radiation and/or hard bursts .",

    "both bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
