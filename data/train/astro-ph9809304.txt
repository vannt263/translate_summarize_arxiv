    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is the nearest galaxy to the milky way ( with the exception of a merging dwarf galaxy ) , one in which individual stars can be distinguished and studied fairly easily with instruments of the highest angular resolution such as the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the lmc is different from the milky way ( mw ) in that it shows more intense star formation ( sf ) , at least when compared with the solar neighborhood , _",
    "i.e. , _ the mw region within @xmath02 kpc of the sun where the interstellar extinction is reasonably small and individual stars can be easily studied in the visible region of the spectrum .",
    "the difference in sf , coupled with the much smaller size of the lmc compared with the mw , implies that this is a dwarf irregular or a tidally truncated small spiral , in which the sf processes are probably different from those in the mw .",
    "feitzinger ( 1987 ) argued that the lmc is a good example of a galaxy in which the sf proceeds primarily via the stochastic self - propagating sf mechanism ( sspsf : gerola & seiden 1978 ) , whereas the conventional view ( _ e.g. , _ kaufman 1979 ) is that the sf in the mw is driven mainly by spiral density waves .",
    "the different sf mechanism , together with the possibility of studying individual stars , are the reasons the lmc is a very popular target for studies of sf - related phenomena ( _ e.g. , _",
    "geha 1998 , battinelli & demers 1998 ) .",
    "there is good reason to study the population of field stars in the lmc ; these objects represent the unspectacular star formation processes in the lmc and , by inference , in dwarf irregular galaxies in general . if we manage to understand the `` quiet '' mode of star formation , _",
    "i.e. , _ that which is not generated in a starburst , we may better understand the origin of the uv radiation in the universe .",
    "note that in starburst galaxies only @xmath020% of the uv light at 2200 is produced by stars in clusters ( meurer 1995 ) and the majority of the light originates from a general population of uv stars .",
    "this diffuse uv emission might be due to the stars that have been ejected from regions of active sf .",
    "studies of the field star population of the lmc were reported by _",
    "e.g. , _ elson ( 1997 ) , geha ( 1998 ) .",
    "these were performed with hst in optical and near - infrared bands , being rather insensitive to massive / hot stars .",
    "the stellar populations of the lmc were reviewed recently by feast ( 1995 ) , who did not find strong evidence for a starburst triggered by a lmc - smc - milky way interaction .",
    "he argued that the sf increase in the lmc was caused by the collapse of the system to a plane about 4 gyrs ago .",
    "the nature of the fainter ultraviolet ( hereafter uv , covering the approximate wavelength range @xmath51000 - 3000 ) sources has not yet been resolved .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that since the td-1 mission in the late 1960s ( thompson 1978 ) there has not been an all - sky survey in the uv",
    ". there has also not been an instrument capable of providing good imaging in the uv , from which photometric parameters and shape information on extended objects could be derived .",
    "previous deep uv observations have been perfomed by the uit shuttle - borne telescope ( stecher 1992 ) and by the foca balloon - borne telescope ( milliard 1992 ) .",
    "the latter are in a spectral band centered at 2015 and @xmath6 wide ; the width of the band depends essentially on the altitude of the balloon which carried the foca telescope to 42 + km altitude .",
    "because of this , the foca passband has a slight red leak ( @xmath7 ) , which depends on the exact altitude of the instrument during the observation .",
    "the results from the diverse foca flights have not yet been published in a systematic manner , as the ground - based follow - up is still in its early phases .",
    "the few published foca results , supplemented by ground - based follow - up observations from large telescopes ( _ e.g. , _ treyer 1998 ) , are sufficiently intriguing to warrant concerted attempts to observe faint uv sources with good angular resolution .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath050% of the uv sources in a field centered on the coma cluster are background galaxies ranging to z@xmath80.7 with strong emission lines .",
    "similar results were announced by the group headed by r. ellis ( treyer 1998 ) .",
    "other uv imaging instruments , such as s201 ( carruthers 1977 ) or faust ( bowyer 1995 ) , had much lower angular resolution than either uit ( @xmath03 arcsec ) or foca ( @xmath010 arcsec ) and did not reach objects as faint as these",
    ". however , these low angular resolution imagers offer unique panoramic views of the lmc in the uv .",
    "previous uv imaging observations of the lmc were reported by page & carruthers ( 1981 ) using the s201 camera carried to the moon s surface during the apollo 16 flight ; by courts ( 1984 ) with the wide - field camera operated on the space shuttle ; by smith ( 1987 ) using a rocket - borne uit prototype ; and by courts ( 1995 ) with the faust instrument .",
    "in addition , observations in the uv near 30 dor with photometers were reported by koornneef ( 1977 ) using the ans satellite with five uv bands and with an angular resolution of 2.5 arcmin ; by nandy ( 1979 ) and morgan ( 1979 ) from the td-1 satellite with four bands and with 1.7 arcmin resolution ; and on stellar assocations in the lmc with the skylab s183 experiment ( vuillemin 1988 ) .",
    "most lmc imaging in the uv was done with very wide field cameras and with low angular resolution , of order 3 - 5 arcmin . despite the low resolution , which allows only for the mapping of the general uv emission pattern , these observations generated quantitative measures of the emission from unresolved sources and diffuse nebulosity in the lmc .",
    "in particular , page & carruthers ( 1981 ) measured the total uv emission from the lmc to be s@xmath9=3.4 10@xmath10 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 ster@xmath11 ( at 1400 ) and s@xmath13=3.8 10@xmath10 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 ster@xmath11",
    "( at 1300 ) .",
    "the 30 doradus and sn 1987a regions in the lmc were observed with higher angular resolution by the uit and the results were published by cheng ( 1992 ) .",
    "the latter observation is relevant , because it relates to a region of the lmc very close to that studied here .",
    "similar uit observations , of the associations lh 52 and lh 53 , and the snr n49 in the lmc , were reported by hill ( 1995 ) .",
    "the field population of uv stars was studied by hill ( 1994 ) , who found a lower star formation ( sf ) rate there than in the stellar associations of the lmc , as well as a sf less biased toward high - mass objects .",
    "finally , all the uv sources in the direction of the lmc which have been observed by uit have been collected in a catalog by parker ( 1998 ) .",
    "the results from the two uit flights constitute the deepest catalog of uv objects in the lmc published to date ( parker 1998 ) .",
    "the uit observations yielded photometry from images with reasonable resolution : fwhm=3.4 arcsec . a comparison of the uit - derived magnitudes and synthetic photometry for 255 stars in common with the iue observatory show no systematic shift , but a standard deviation of 0.25 mag in the distribution of magnitudes .",
    "it is possible that many uv sources are cosmologically - important objects , as treyer ( 1998 ) have shown .",
    "these sources may account for a large part of the extragalactic diffuse uv background ( duvb ) ; this may not vanish completely in directions with very low hi column densities , indicating that not all the duvb is dust - scattered galactic uv light ( leinert 1998 ) .",
    "this motivated us to study the deepest uv observations obtained in parallel mode by the largest orbiting astronomical telescope , the hubble space telescope .",
    "hst is equipped , in principle , with three uv - imaging instruments : wfpc2 , foc , and stis .",
    "the second instrument has an extremely restricted field of view , while the third has a similarly small field but a much higher photometric accuracy , dynamic range , and throughput than the foc .",
    "however , stis can not be used ( yet ) for parallel uv imaging observations because of the possible damage to the mama detectors by uv sources , and most of its pointings are in the direction of crowded , well - defined fields such as galactic nuclei and globular clusters where the sources are fainter than the damage limit .",
    "it is clear that , at present , only wfpc2 can offer a reasonably large field combined with some uv throughput for the serendipitous study of the uv sky .",
    "a number of papers have been published which analyse data collected with the wfpc2 uv filter set .",
    "most of these filters have significant red leaks and the accuracy of the photometry can not always be fully estimated . for this reason ,",
    "many researchers prefer to use the f160bw filter .",
    "this `` wood s filter '' separates a pure uv band with an effective wavelength @xmath14=1491 and bandpass 446 ( holtzman 1995 : h95b ) .",
    "the f160bw filter has a very low throughput ( approximately one order of magnitude below other uv filters from the wfpc2 complement ) ; however , its bandpass has no red leak , unlike other wfpc2 filters .",
    "it also vignettes @xmath01/8 of the field imaged through each wf ccd ( the pc chip is not vignetted ) .",
    "more details about this filter can be found in watson ( 1994 ) .",
    "observations using f160bw to study hot stars in globular clusters were reported by _",
    "e.g. , _ mould ( 1996 ) and cole ( 1997 ) . hunter ( 1997 ) studied the uv emission from another cluster ( r136 ) with the f170w filter , as did gilmozzi ( 1994 ) for the `` double cluster '' ngc 1850a+b ; the f170w filter has a very strong red leak and the interpretation of the results with it is difficult .    in order to realize fully the uv imaging potential of the wfpc2+f160bw combination , a program of parallel imaging",
    "was initiated by jm .",
    "some archived observations obtained in this program are used here to study the field population of uv stars in the lmc .",
    "we use the results to estimate the diffuse uv emission from the lmc and by inference , from other star - bursting dwarf galaxies , and to evaluate the degree of contamination by field uv stars of the pointed observations of globular and open clusters in the lmc .",
    "our observations and reductions are described in section 2 and the photometry is discussed in section 3 .",
    "optical counterparts are identified in section 4 , and their nature is discussed in section 5 .",
    "the detection of a significant number of uv stars allows us to draw some general conclusions about the sf in the lmc .",
    "the hst observed objects in the n132d region of the lmc with the faint object spectrograph from 23 to 26 august 1995 collecting data for proposal 5607 . during these very long pointings",
    "the wfpc2 was commanded to observe in parallel with the f160bw filter .",
    "these observations are ideal to study the population of hot stars in the crowded environment of the lmc . during the lmc session",
    "the wfpc2 acquired 12 images with f160bw with exposure times of 2300 sec to 4900 sec , which we analyze here .",
    "a log of the hst data sets used in this paper is given in table 1 .",
    "the region observed by hst is centered at ( j2000 ) 5@xmath15 25@xmath16 , 69@xmath17 30 ; the foreground extinction in this direction is e(b ",
    "v)@xmath180.1 ( lucke 1974 ) .",
    "the area is located near the southeast end of the lmc bar , not on the bar itself but rather on its northern edge , @xmath19 off its major axis , and @xmath20 off the lmc s kinematic center .",
    "the list of uv - bright objects or regions in the lmc detected by s201 ( page & carruthers 1981 ) contains no object in this direction , and neither does the catalog of infrared sources in the lmc and smc ( schwering & israel 1990 ) .",
    "the map of radio continuum produced by xu ( 1992 ) shows that at the location of the hst wfpc2 pointing there are no strong ridges of 6.3 cm continuum emission .",
    "the map of diffuse h@xmath21 emission ( fig . 8 in xu 1992 ) shows that the line emission is also minimal in this location , but that 30 dor , about half a degree to the east , is very bright .",
    "the region is one of those studied by davies ( 1976 ) with uk schmidt plates through a 100 wide h@xmath21 filter to search for nebulosities .",
    "the n132d region is noted in their table ii along with n132h as being faint and having `` knots in envelope '' , a size of 7@xmath224 arcmin , and corresponding to the mc39 11 cm radio source .",
    "mc39 is a radio and xray - detected supernova remnant ( clark 1982 ) , located @xmath010 arcmin south of the wfpc2 region imaged in the uv .",
    "the wide field imaging by the s183 experiment indicates that the emission at 2600 ( 250 passband ) from the location of the hst pointings analyzed here is less than 2.69 10@xmath23 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 ( square arcmin)@xmath11 ( vuillemin 1988 , fig .",
    "this figure also shows that the hst pointing was not towards any of the uv - bright stellar associations in the lmc .    the image of the n132 field in fig .",
    "3 of parker ( 1998 ) contains the hst field studied here in its lower - left ( north of the center ) part .",
    "no exceptionally high stellar density is apparent , nor is this a very sparse field . a careful comparison between the 11@xmath17.4 diameter image obtained by smith ( 1987 ) at 1590 and shown as the top figure of their plate 23 and the location of the n132 field in the r - band image shown by parker ( 1998 , fig .",
    "2 ) emphasizes that the location of the hst region studied here is off the lmc bar .",
    "although the diffuse uv emission in the vicinity of n132 seems to be higher than from the rest of the lmc disk , it is clear that the hst observations pointed to an area of unexceptional ( faint ) diffuse uv emission , between shapley constellations ii and v ( see fig . 4 of smith 1987 ) .",
    "as it is not clear how good is the flat fielding of the very wide field image in smith ( 1987 ) , we can not remark on the absolute uv surface brightness from the location of hst observations .",
    "the region observed with the hst is therefore typical of the `` field '' stellar population of the lmc , _",
    "i.e. , _ not containing stellar associations or clusters , hii regions or known supernova remnants . it is , thus , representative of the field stellar population in the nearest dwarf galaxy which shows intense star formation .",
    "the lmc images obtained by hst are shown in the mosaic of figure 1 , where the different frames have been combined using the astrometric parameters of the pc chip from set a as produced by the hst reduction pipeline .",
    "the other images were linked into the mosaic through stars in common with previously linked images .",
    "we indicate the scale of the figure with a 30 arcsec bar and the north and west directions by vectors plotted at the figure s lower right corner . the mosaic is shown here for display purposes only and it was not used in the photometric reduction .",
    "note also that in its creation we made no attempt to remove distortions , which are small , in general , for the wfpc2 .",
    "the images are grouped by coordinates in sets ( a through f ) , which were obtained in the same sky position , with the same guide stars , and at the same hst roll angle . using the task * gcombine * of iraf ( in stsdas.toolbox.imgtools ) , with the ccdcrrej option which is based on rejection of pixels higher by more than five standard deviations from their immediate surroundings , or with the combination of images based on crrej ( in stsdas.hst_calib.wfpc ) where pixels in stacked images are rejected by a similar algorithm , it is possible to eliminate most of the cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "these are especially troublesome in very long wfpc2 exposures and it is virtually impossible to see any uv source before combining at least two images and rejecting the cr events .    even with the ccdcrrej option enough traces of cr events remained in the combined frame , mainly at locations where one cr track crossed another , to significantly confuse the detection of faint objects .",
    "this is because of the low throughput of the wfpc2+f160bw combination , the very low uv sky background in this spectral region , and the susceptibility of the wfpc2 ccds to cr events .",
    "however , these cases could be rejected by blinking the combined images against individual frames used in the same combination . the case for dataset",
    "f is particularly difficult to analyze , as it consists of a single long exposure with significant but not identical overlap with set e. for this dataset we identified only objects visible in the original frames which had the proper intensity profile of a star ( after some cr - cleaning with the * cosmicray * task in noao.imred.ccdred ) .",
    "we used the combined frames to identify genuine uv sources by blinking combined sets of frames with significant overlap .",
    "the objects recognized this way are listed with a double or triple entry in table 2 .",
    "we accepted only those sources which appeared in a combined image , and which we could recognize on the two ( or three ) original images which made up the combined image and had the `` proper '' shape parameters ( fwhm@xmath240.2 arcsec ) expected of genuine stellar images .",
    "we calculated the celestial coordinates of all sources and performed aperture photometry with the * phot * package ( in noao.digiphot.apphot ) with a 0.5 arcsec round aperture .",
    "this is justified , given the psf fwhm of images obtained with f160bw ( up to @xmath00.26 arcsec ; watson 1994 ) .",
    "the * phot * package performs aperture photometry and subtracts the sky background as estimated from a ring around the aperture .",
    "when performing aperture photometry , the undersampling of the wf psf is not important .",
    "the photometry has not been corrected for charge transfer efficiency ( whitmore & heyer 1997 ) , because we found this to be insignificant in comparison with the other uncertainties in the data .",
    "for the same reason we did not correct for psf variability .",
    "we performed aperture corrections by subtracting 0.1 mag from the * phot * results .",
    "we also corrected for the molecular contamination of the wfpc2 ( mackenty 1995 ) .",
    "the photometry is reported in table 2 as _ monochromatic magnitudes _ at @xmath25=1491 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the gain ratio and @xmath29 is the zero point constant from holtzman ( 1995 ) .",
    "we did not specifically exclude sources in the areas vignetted by the f160bw filter .",
    "these are included in the table and are marked by a * v * following the dataset and ccd chip identifiers given in column 6 . among the 341 independent measurements , only 28 are of objects in vignetted locations on the wf chips . in four cases",
    "a source with multiple measurements appears vignetted in one image but is not vignetted on others ; this allows a comparison of photometry which helps evaluate the effect of vignetting . with one exception ( source no .",
    "45 ) the two photometry measurements agree to within 0.27 mag or better .",
    "we conclude that the vignetting by the f160bw filter does not appear to significantly influence our photometry .",
    "we present the raw uv photometry results for all the objects identified in the wfpc2 images in table 2 .",
    "each independent measurement is identified by a source number , which is the running number of uv sources and indicates the order in which the sources were identified .",
    "some objects appear in more than one ( combined ) image ; for each measurement we present the derived value and the photometric error , the image set from which the particular result originated ( a , b , c , _ etc . _ ) , and the ccd chip in which the object appeared .",
    "for example , the first object in table 2 was detected in the pc chip of the combined set a , at pixel coordinates ( 242.117 ; 260.523 ) and its raw uv magnitude was 19.190@xmath300.041 .",
    "the on - chip pixel coordinates are listed beside the celestial coordinates , to aid further investigations of the sources .",
    "the correlation between different measurements was done through the celestial coordinates ( calculated with the iraf * metric * task , in stsdas.hst_calib.wfpc ) , recognizing two separate observations as belonging to the same object if their image centers were separated by @xmath180.5 arcsec . the photometric error listed in table 2",
    "is that given by the * phot * task in iraf , _",
    "i.e. , _ a formal error depending on the photon count and the local background ; this does not reflect the calibration error of the photometry from f160bw images or residual flat field errors .",
    "note that the f160bw flat field correction can be quite noisy ( biretta & baggett 1998 ) . the calibration error , on the other hand",
    ", is @xmath010% at the center of the ccd chips ( baggett 1998 ) .",
    "we combined the different measurements of the same object in a single entry in table 3 , which has the source coordinates , uv magnitudes and errors .",
    "we identify a source by its first listed source number in table 2 .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of remeasurements of the same object ; approximately half of the objects have been measured more than once .",
    "figure 3 shows the distribution of apparent uv magnitudes from table 3 .",
    "objects with more than one measurement are shown in the lower panel .    a formal comparison of the two magnitude distributions , _",
    "e.g. , _ via a kolmogorov - smirnov test of the cumulative distributions , shows that they are not drawn from the same parent population .",
    "this is probably the combination of differences introduced at the faint end of the distribution by a few spurious sources and at the bright end by the differnt areal coverage ; while singly - detected sources can appear anywhere on the mosaic in fig .",
    "1 , the multiply - measured objects * must * reside in the region of image overlap , which is smaller than the total area observed by hst .",
    "note also that faint sources may register on an individual image but not on another from a different image combination ; it would contribute a real source measured only once , although it may reside in an overlap region .",
    "3 shows that ( a ) brighter objects are more frequently seen in multiple exposures , and ( b ) despite the caveat in the previous paragraph , the faint end of the distribution is not dominated by the singly - measured objects . in fact , the drop in the number - magnitude plots occurs in both histograms at m@xmath4=19 , indicating a similar degree of completeness for the singly - measured and multiply - measured objects .",
    "it is possible that a few faint sources are spurious , but most represent real objects conservatively chosen while adopting stellar images as candidate objects .",
    "we have likely missed some fainter lmc objects through this methodology , but we are fairly certain that we excluded virtually all spurious sources .",
    "the number - magnitude diagrams indicate that our photometry becomes incomplete at m@xmath318.5 .    comparing the independent measurements of the same objects , after correcting for wfpc2 contamination , we derive an unbiased estimator of the measurement error , which disregards calibration unknowns but which is more representative of the internal photometry error than the value given by *",
    "phot*. this is the measurement error we adopt and present in table 3 . we show in figure 4 the distribution of the individual fuv measurements for objects which have been measured independently twice ( filled squares ) where the error bars are the formal * phot * errors of these points , and the average value adopted in table 3 ( empty diamonds ) with its error bar estimated from the dispersion of the individual measurements .",
    "it is clear that the dispersion of the measurements is reasonably small for objects with m@xmath3119 , but increases for objects at m@xmath3219 to one or more magnitudes .",
    "this demonstrates once again that the completeness limit of the uv observations reported here is near m@xmath3318.5 .",
    "we note that none of the @xmath0200 uv objects identified here appear convincingly extended when examined on the hst f160bw images .",
    "we conclude tentatively that most of them are probably stars or starlike objects , and that in the direction of the small lmc area sampled by the observations there are no uv - bright background galaxies .    the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) imaged regions of the lmc in fuv and nuv bands during the astro-1 flight .",
    "results of these observations , pertaining to the stellar associations lh52 and lh53 , were published by hill ( 1995 ) .",
    "the results concerning field stars in the lmc were discussed in the context of the imf in the field and in associations ( hill 1994 ) . despite the shallowness of the uit results , by @xmath03 mag relative to the hst data reported here , it is worthwhile first to consider the relative density of field stars .",
    "we find @xmath0200 stars in 12 arcmin@xmath34 to m@xmath3319 , while hill ( 1994 ) find that about 70% of their 1563 stars , to m@xmath3315 , belong to the field population .",
    "this yields a projected density of 0.9 star arcmin@xmath35 for stars brighter than m@xmath4=16 , from which we expect to find 10 stars brighter than m@xmath4=16 in our data .",
    "instead , as fig .",
    "5 demonstrates , we find almost four times this number of stars in our hst images .",
    "an extensive catalog of uv stars in the two mcs , originating from both astro-1 ( 1990 ) and astro-2 ( 1995 ) observations , was published by parker ( 1998 ) .",
    "the uit observations most relevant to the analysis presented here are toward n132 and were obtained during the astro-2 flight with the b1 filter ( @xmath36=1521 , @xmath37=354 ) .",
    "this bandpass is very close to that of the hst wfpc2 f160bw , with a 30 difference in @xmath36 and the hst bandpass being wider by 92  than that of the present observations , therefore a direct comparison of measured magnitudes is justified .",
    "the lmc area sampled by the hst f160bw mosaic is much smaller than the uit image and lies close to the northern edge of the n132 field .",
    "the list of parker has been examined and the objects in common with our data set have been extracted and are presented in table 4 .",
    "a comparison between the uit b1 magnitudes and those derived here for the same objects indicates that , with the exception of one object , the uit stars are reported brighter by @xmath01 magnitude than the hst photometry .",
    "this could , in principle , be the effect of a consistent calibration error of the f160bw magnitudes relative to the calibration of uit , which is derived from objects in common with iue .",
    "we deem it more likely to be the result of confusion contributions in the moderate angular resolution uit images .",
    "in fact , in many cases we can identify the stars which would have been included as single stars in the uit photometry ; these additional contributors are listed on separate lines in table 4 , below the primary hst candidate counterpart . despite the inclusion of the additional stars , we were not able to reproduce the uit magnitudes by adding up their measured flux . obviously ,",
    "more objects than the stars we detected must be included in order to account for the difference in magnitudes , from which one can assume that there are even more faint uv stars not detected in our wfpc2 images which crowd into the uit psf and are measured as a single star .",
    "note that the uv survey to be conducted by galex ( bianchi & martin 1997 ) will have similar problems to those of uit in observing the lmc , as its angular resolution shall be only 3 - 5 arcsec .",
    "these would only be more acute in moderately crowded fields , as galex is supposed to reach fainter uv magnitudes than did uit .",
    "one basic requirement for discussing the nature of the fainter uv sources is the correspondence with an optical counterpart .",
    "unfortunately , the f160bw observations in the direction of the lmc were not collected together with hst imaging with other filters , thus no images with comparable resolution in a different spectral band exist in the hst archives .",
    "we attempted photometry on the scans of the second stsci digitized sky survey ( dss - ii ) , but the relatively large pixel size used for these scans , compounded with the plate scale of the schmidt plates , resulted in extreme crowding of the stellar images .",
    "no photometry to a reasonable accuracy could be performed on the stars at the location of the hst region studied here using the dss scans .",
    "we searched published catalogs with photometric information and could identify 58 uv sources in table 3 with objects listed in the roe / nrl catalog ( yentis 1992 ; wallin 1994 ) .",
    "this catalog is derived from cosmos 5@xmath382.3 scans of the short red ukst survey plates in the direction of the lmc , which were scanned with a very small laser beam , resulting in a smaller pixel size than the 15@xmath39 m of the dss - ii .",
    "the astrometry is based on the hst guide star catalog and the positions are accurate to @xmath02 arcsec .",
    "the roe / nrl catalog also lists magnitudes , which are in a band close to johnson r , have a typical accuracy of 0.2 mag , and reach objects as faint as @xmath021.5 mag .",
    "our identification of an optical counterpart for a uv source required a positional coincidence within 2 arcsec ; this is justified , given the astrometric accuracy of the roe / nrl catalog , but may result in some chance coincidences .",
    "the success rate in finding optical counterparts by cross - correlating with the roe / nrl catalog is 78% for objects with m@xmath4016 and drops to @xmath41% for m@xmath4218 .",
    "the dependence of the success rate on the uv brightness , which should in principle be related to the optical brightness of the counterpart , indicates that most optical identifications are probably not chance effects .",
    "however , the fact that we could not find optical counterparts for all the bright uv sources is puzzling .",
    "one possibility , which we could not test , is that some possible counterparts were rejected by the roe automatic processing of the cosmos scans because of extreme crowding , thus they are not listed in the roe / nrl catalog .",
    "we transformed approximately the roe / nrl catalog magnitudes to the v band to determine the nature of the lmc uv sources by assuming that the objects are earlier than mid - f and converting their uv - r color indices to uv - v .",
    "the lmc objects for which we found optical counterparts in the roe / nrl catalog are listed in table 5 , along with their uv and optical data . the error in uv ",
    "v is obtained as the harmonic mean of the uv photometric error in table 3 and an assumed 0.2 mag error in v propagated from the `` short - red '' magnitude listed in the roe / nrl catalog and the adopted transformation .",
    "we compare the properties of the lmc stars to stars in the milky way via an observational color - magnitude diagram based on high galactic latitude objects observed with the faust shuttle - borne telescope .",
    "we elected to use observed photometry instead of convolving theoretical model atmosphere spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with the different instrumental responses , or using iue spectra ( _ e.g. , _",
    "fanelli 1992 ) convolved similarly , because the uv photometric results are unbiased and uv - selected , just as the lmc sample is unbiased and uv - selected .",
    "the comparison is made with stars observed by the faust experiment in the direction of the north galactic pole ( ngp ) , coma , and virgo ( brosch 1995 , 1997 , 1998 ) which have parallax measurements in the hipparcos and tycho catalogs .",
    "we consider the lmc stars listed in table 5 to be at a distance modulus of 18.5 for the purpose of determining their absolute magnitudes , and plot them in the same diagram with the faust objects .",
    "the faust observations are in a spectral band centered at @xmath43=1650 and @xmath44300 wide , which is not too different from the wfpc2+f160bw band definition ( @xmath36=1491 , @xmath44446 ) .",
    "the two bands mostly overlap , with the hst one being wider and bluer than that of faust .",
    "as both bands are not defined extremely accurately , we can not derive a color term to transform between the two .",
    "it is possible that some chromatic effects may be present , mainly in the photometry of the high t@xmath45 stars which are very blue .",
    "we note also that the faust observations are biased * against * the detection of hot main sequence stars because of the direction of observation ( high @xmath46b@xmath46 ) and the relative rarity of these stars in the immediate solar neighborhood where hipparcos parallaxes are available . for this reason , the earliest main sequence object we can locate on",
    "the faust color - magnitude diagram is late - b .",
    "the uv color - magnitude diagram shown in fig .",
    "6 indicates that the lmc objects join up smoothly with the galactic uv stars in coma , virgo , and the north galactic pole region .",
    "these have been identified in the publications mentioned above as main sequence stars . by inference",
    ", we deduce that at least the 58 objects with roe / nrl catalog counterparts are also mostly main sequence objects .",
    "note that the apparent width of the upper main sequence , as defined by the hst data from the lmc field , is similar to that of the lower main sequence defined by the faust stars in the mw .",
    "figure 5 shows that the f160bw mini - survey of the lmc field becomes progressively incomplete for m@xmath47 .",
    "considering the distance modulus , this indicates that we are observing lmc objects in the general field with m@xmath48 , but we detect objects as faint as m@xmath3 + 2.5 .",
    "the faintest objects for which we have uv - optical color information may , therefore , be early - f main sequence stars .",
    "we added the uv emission from all the detected stars and found that these account for 2.53 10@xmath49 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 for the entire area surveyed here .",
    "this translates into 2.49 10@xmath10 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 ster@xmath11 at 1500 from stellar sources not in clusters or associations , and is consistent with the integrated lmc emission at 1400 from page & carruthers ( 1981 ) ; their value is higher by one third , but they include all uv sources , cluster and field , in their estimate .",
    "the average uv brightness measured by td-1 ( morgan 1979 ) in the immediate vicinity of the hst - imaged region of the lmc is 6.8 10@xmath10 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath11 ster@xmath11 at 1550 .",
    "this is higher by a factor of 2.7 than we measure , but the nearest td-1 measurement ( region iii ) lies @xmath020 arcmin south of the region studied here , deeper into the lmc bar .    _ the calculation shows that the large part of the uv radiation in the lmc , at least for @xmath501500 , is produced by field stars and not by objects in clusters or associations .",
    "_ this is consistent with the estimate by parker ( 1998 ) that @xmath060% of the uv light in the n132 image originates in stars fainter than 16 mag or from diffuse emission .",
    "it is also consistent with the measurement of meurer ( 1995 ) that in starbursts , clusters of young stars provide at most 20% of the uv emission .",
    "our integrated value for the 1500 emission , combined with the upper limit for the diffuse emission at this location and at 2600 from vuillemin ( 1988 ) , indicates a uv color index [ 1500][2600]@xmath510.26 for the integrated stellar population detected in the uv .",
    "photometry of field uv sources with the faust experiment was done , as mentioned above , in a spectral band very similar to that defined by wfpc2 and f160bw . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we use here the results for the ngp ( brosch 1995 ) and the virgo regions ( brosch 1997 ) , from which we selected only the stellar sources .",
    "data from the coma field ( brosch 1998 ) is not used because this faust field is not representative of the `` general field '' of the high - latitude mw , as it contains the mel 111 open cluster . a comparison with the lmc stars detected here with the hst is valid , because with the sensitivity limit of faust it observed mostly galactic sources . at the ngp and virgo high ( northern ) galactic latitude of the faust exposures referred to here",
    "we should have a fair indication of ( half ) the projected density of uv stars in the milky way ( mw ) . in these regions",
    "faust detected 172 stars to a uv magnitude limit of @xmath014 and a completeness limit of @xmath012.5 .",
    "the faust images considered here cover a solid angle of @xmath00.05 ster , which projects to @xmath01.7 10@xmath2 pc@xmath34 when viewed from outside the mw and adopting a 1 kpc scale height for the uv stars .",
    "the coverage of the lmc f160bw mosaic is @xmath012 square arcmin , which corresponds to @xmath04400 pc@xmath34 at the distance of the lmc , thus about one quarter the projected area in the milky way sampled by faust .",
    "therefore , the projected number density of uv stars in the hst observation of the lmc field region is n@xmath520.045 stars pc@xmath35 , whereas faust counted n@xmath530.01 stars pc@xmath35 in the mw . the latter value should be doubled to account for the full width of the galactic disk when viewed from outside .",
    "it is possible to compare directly the faust results with those of the present hst observations .",
    "while faust sampled the ( thick ) galactic disk and the halo , hst observed the edge of the bar and the disk of the lmc to a similar depth .",
    "the reason is that the objects deteced by faust reach into the thick disk and the halo of the mw to @xmath01 kpc , while the hst observed objects at @xmath060 kpc ; the gain in sensitivity with hst makes up for the increased distance to yield approximately similar depths of observation .",
    "thus , if the projected density of uv - bright stars in the lmc and in the disk and halo of the mw would have been the same , similar projected number densities of stars should have been observed , assuming that the lmc thickness is probably not much different than that of the mw .",
    "however , note that the value of n@xmath54 for the lmc field is higher than that in the mw , as reflected by the faust data .",
    "the spatial density of hot stars in the lmc field regime is apparently higher by a factor of 2 - 3 than that in the mw .",
    "_ we emphasize that our observations indicate a significant contamination by young field stars in all cluster uv observations in the lmc .",
    "_ this is especially important in case one aims to detect blue stragglers , or hot evolved stars which belong to the target cluster ( _ e.g. , _ mould 1996 , where four blue stragglers were identified ) ; if the detected objects have a projected density of @xmath017 arcmin@xmath35 to m@xmath319 they may well be only field interlopers , as already remarked by cole ( 1997 ) .",
    "finally , we can use our data , in combination with the similar magnitude estimates by uit in n132 ( parker 1998 ) to produce a combined ( observational ) luminosity function for uv stars from m@xmath4=8 to 19 . for this purpose",
    "we selected the n132 objects from the lmc catalog of parker and scaled our hst stellar uv magnitude distribution to the total number of stars in the uit sample with 12@xmath18m@xmath3115 .",
    "this is the magnitude range where the uit star counts should be essentially complete and where no hst objects were probably missed .",
    "there are 2271 uit stars in the n132 region , whereas there are only 17 hst stars in the same magnitude range , yielding a scale factor for the number count of 133.59 .",
    "this is close to the ratio of sampled areas between the uit field and that of the hst mosaic ( @xmath0105 ) , providing some confidence for this scaling approach .",
    "note that the possible @xmath0one magnitude discrepancy between the uit and hst magnitudes would not affect our conclusions significantly , because the slope of the uv luminosity function is defined mainly by its faint end , _",
    "i.e. , _ by the hst measurements .",
    "we show in figure 7 the two luminosity functions plotted on the same scale .",
    "it is evident that the scaling procedure continues the trend of higher star counts to m@xmath318 , after which faint stars are progressively lost from the hst images .",
    "figure 8 shows the logarithm of the combined star counts , where for m@xmath3113 we adoped the uit star counts and for the fainter magnitudes those from the ( scaled ) hst data set .",
    "we compare the slope of this observed luminosity function with the models presented in parker ( 1998 ) for the uit star counts .",
    "the models allow a comparison with an lmc metallicity population formed continuously over a period @xmath55 t with a salpeter imf , using fig .",
    "11 from parker and comparing the predicted slope of the star count distribution between m@xmath4=10 and m@xmath4=15 with the same parameter from the actual , combined star count .",
    "the closest fit is with a stellar population formed over @xmath55t@xmath241 gyr , because the younger star formation processes produce a distribution of the fainter uv stars which is much shallower than observed .",
    "this is consistent with the finding of geha ( 1998 ) that the sf rate in the lmc did not change appreciably in the last 2 gyr .",
    "it is similarly possible to compare the slope of predicted luminosity functions for a continuous star formation over 1 gyr , with different imf slopes ( fig .",
    "14 of parker ) , with that actually observed .",
    "the comparison indicates that the parker ( 1998 ) model with the slope most similar to that measured here is that with an initial mass function slope @xmath56 of 1.8 , close to the salpeter value and found also to best fit the uit data .",
    "although the data do not really warrant it , we note that the measured slope is smaller than that predicted by the models with @xmath56=1.8 but higher that that for @xmath56=1.0 .",
    "thus , a salpeter slope with @xmath56=1.4 would probably be better than the 1.8 value found to best fit the bright end of the uv luminosity function by parker",
    "we analyzed a set of very deep hst images obtained in a uv spectral band which is not contaminated by visible light leaks .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we identified 198 uv sources with stars in the `` general field '' of the lmc , at the edge of the bar and not associated with any known star cluster or association .",
    "2 .   a comparison with galactic objects for the 30% of the sources for which we found optical catalog counterparts indicates that the objects are main sequence stars .",
    "the uv emission from the stellar sources we detected , scaled to the entire solid angle covered by the lmc , accounts for 2/3 of the uv emission from the cloud .",
    "the observed uv luminosity function joins up smoothly with that defined for brighter objects , but on a wider field , from the uit observation of the n 132 region .",
    "the joint luminosity function of uv stars , which covers the uv magnitude range 8 to 19 , confirms the claim by parker ( 1998 ) that the lmc `` field '' domain has been forming stars continuously over ( at least ) 1 gyr , with an imf close to the salpeter law .",
