    "the single - band hubbard model describing the fermions on an optical lattice is given by @xcite @xmath7 at large @xmath8 , this model has three main energy scales .",

    ", these scales are well separated from each other , @xmath10 . as we show below , the separation of the energy scale @xmath1 from the other energy scales @xmath2 and @xmath11 leads to a slow decay of doublons in the system .    in order to decay",
    "the doublon has to give up its energy @xmath3 to other excitations in the system .",
    "let the typical energy of a possible excitation be @xmath12 where @xmath12 can be either @xmath13 or @xmath14 depending on the background state in which the doublon is propagating .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 , so that a large number @xmath16 of excitations must be created to satisfy energy constraints .",
    "the matrix element for this process can be calculated by an @xmath17 order perturbation theory and is given by @xmath18 the decay rate is @xmath19 in units of @xmath20 . using stirling s formula , and the fact that @xmath21 , we find that for large @xmath22 the decay rate scales as @xmath23 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants which we will extract from detailed calculations and experimental data .    in order to discuss the specific decay mechanisms of a doublon",
    ", we need to specify the state of the background system in which the doublon is propagating .",
    "if the system is a homogeneous mott insulator at half - filling , the only possible candidate for transfer of energies are spin excitations with bandwidth @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to the decay rate scaling as @xmath25 and is an extremely slow process . however ,",
    "if the system is compressible , the dominant energy transfers are to kinetic energy of the fermions through creation of particle - hole pairs with typical energy @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to the decay rate scaling as @xmath27 .",
    "this is a much faster decay process and will dominate over decay through spin excitations .",
    "we note that compressible states with holes can exist ( i ) at the edges of systems with confining traps or ( ii ) in the bulk of the system as a result of a large density of doublons created by modulation spectroscopy . in a trapped system",
    ", there is another possibility of giving up the energy to the potential energy of the fermions at the edges .",
    "this however involves transfer of particles from the center to the edges of the trap and is usually a much slower process for typical shallow traps used in cold atom experiments .    as we will see in the next section our experimental system has a lot of holes and we can eliminate many of the possible decay mechanisms for our experimental configuration .",
    "therefore , in this paper we shall focus on the dominant doublon decay channel involving excitation of particle hole pairs .",
    "this section describes the experimental steps towards the observation of doublon relaxation : initially , a sample of repulsively interacting , ultracold fermions is produced and loaded into an optical lattice . starting from this equilibrium state , we create additional double occupancies via lattice modulation . immediately after this excitation",
    "we measure the time evolution of the double occupancy .",
    "we remove the influence of inelastic loss processes by comparing to a reference measurement and extract the elastic doublon lifetime using a simple rate equations model .",
    "finally , this elastic lifetime is normalized with the tunneling time @xmath28 and found to depend exponentially on @xmath29 .    the experimental sequence used to produce quantum degenerate fermi gases has been described in detail in previous work @xcite . in brief , we prepare @xmath30 @xmath31k atoms at temperatures below @xmath32 of the fermi temperature @xmath33 in a balanced mixture of two magnetic sublevels of the @xmath34 hyperfine manifold .",
    "the confinement is given by a crossed beam dipole trap with trapping frequencies @xmath35 . to access a wide range of repulsive interactions",
    "we make use of two magnetic feshbach resonances . with a @xmath36 spin mixture",
    ", we realize scattering lengths of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the bohr radius @xcite .",
    "the @xmath40 spin mixture allows us to reach the strongly repulsive regime with scattering lengths of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite . after adjusting the scattering length to the desired value",
    ", we add a three - dimensional optical lattice of simple cubic symmetry .",
    "the lattice depth is increased in @xmath44 to final values between @xmath45 and @xmath46 in units of the recoil energy @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 is planck s constant , @xmath49 the atomic mass and @xmath50 the wavelength of the lattice beams .",
    "the lattice beams have gaussian profiles with @xmath51 radii of @xmath52 at the position of the atoms . for a given scattering length and lattice depth , @xmath20 and @xmath1",
    "are inferred from wannier functions @xcite .",
    "their statistical and systematic errors are dominated by the lattice calibration and the accuracies in width and position of the two feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "depending on @xmath1 and @xmath20 the final states of the system range from metallic to mott insulating phases , but always with a double occupancy below @xmath32 .",
    "this equilibrium system is now excited by a sinusoidal modulation of the lattice depth with a frequency close to @xmath53 .",
    "this causes an increase of the double occupancy between 5 and @xmath54 as compared to the initial state .",
    "the modulation amplitude is @xmath55 on all three axes , while the modulation duration was chosen such that the amount of doubly occupied lattice sites saturates @xcite .",
    "the system is now in a highly excited non - equilibrium state with double occupancies between 15 and @xmath56 .",
    "after free evolution at the initial lattice depth and interaction strength for a variable hold time up to @xmath57s we probe the remaining double occupancy of the system .",
    "this is accomplished by a sudden increase of the lattice depth to @xmath58 , which prevents further tunneling .",
    "we then measure the amount of atoms residing on singly ( doubly ) occupied sites @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) by encoding the double occupancy into a previously unpopulated spin state using radio frequency spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "combining stern - gerlach separation and absorption imaging we obtain the single occupancy @xmath61 , double occupancy @xmath62 and total atom number @xmath63 .",
    "the time evolution of the double and single occupancy and of the total atom number is shown for two different parameter sets in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ rawdata59 ] . in both cases",
    ", the double occupancy decays exponentially within the observation time , and the single occupancy rises accordingly .",
    "the time evolution of the total atom number , however , exhibits a remarkable difference between the @xmath64 and the @xmath65 spin mixture : whilst the atom number of the @xmath66 sample remains rather constant , the @xmath67 sample suffers from an atom number reduction of 50@xmath68 within @xmath69s .",
    "this behavior can be observed for all parameter sets and is a consequence of the shorter lifetime of a @xmath67 spin mixture .",
    "the only relevant process described by the fermi - hubbard model is the decay of a doublon into two single particles which remain within the system .",
    "the time associated with this process will be called doublon lifetime . in an experiment ,",
    "inelastic processes may occur , resulting in atoms exiting the system . for a valid comparison with theory it is therefore crucial that these processes do not interfere with the determination of the doublon lifetime . in the following ,",
    "we show how we eliminate the influence of inelastic loss processes on the observation of the doublon decay .",
    "for every dataset on doublon decay after lattice modulation , we record a corresponding reference dataset without lattice modulation , but with the same system parameters .",
    "two of these reference datasets are presented in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ rawdata59 ] .",
    "they show the dynamics of double occupancies and atom number governed by inelastic processes , which are not taken into account by the fermi - hubbard model .    combining these two measurements",
    ", we can unambiguously extract the doublon lifetime by simultaneously fitting a system of coupled rate equations .",
    "they describe the population dynamics in the optical lattice , considering three general processes :    @xmath70    the total number of atoms on doubly occupied sites @xmath60 is written as the sum of the equilibrium population @xmath71 and the additional amount of double occupancy @xmath72 created by the lattice modulation .",
    "the three time constants correspond to three independent local decay processes differing in the type of site they affect : @xmath73 describes the population flow from doubly occupied to singly occupied lattice sites visible as a decay of double occupancy within @xmath74 that is accompanied by a rise of the single occupancy .",
    "we identify this time with the lifetime of doublons .",
    "the other two times denote loss time constants , which lead to a reduction of the total atom number : @xmath75 corresponds to losses affecting both site types in the same manner , which is only observed in the total atom number .",
    "additional inelastic losses on doubly occupied sites are summarized by @xmath76 , visible as a simultaneous decay of both the total atom number and double occupancy .",
    "this model does not account for changes of the decay times during the decay or for higher order terms in the rate equations .    since the modulation has no influence on the evolution of the total atom number , this procedure removes the influence of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "a reliable determination of the doublon lifetime @xmath79 is thus possible if it differs significantly from the loss times .",
    "the model and the observation are found to agree very well within experimental uncertainties , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rawdata59 ] .",
    "we measure this doublon lifetime for various tunneling and interaction strengths , covering a parameter range where @xmath20 and @xmath1 each differ by at least a factor of four .",
    "the determined lifetimes vary over two orders of magnitude , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lifetimeuj ] .",
    "furthermore , the lifetime clearly does not depend on the tunneling energy or the interaction energy alone .     and @xmath20 .",

    "error bars denote the confidence intervals of the lifetime fits and the statistical errors in @xmath1 and @xmath20 . ]",
    "since the tunneling time @xmath82 is the dominant timescale of dynamics in an optical lattice , it appears natural to express the doublon lifetime in units of @xmath82 .",
    "after this rescaling , we found that , to a good extent , the doublon lifetime only depends on the ratio @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig3:scalingdata ] shows the doublon lifetime in units of the tunneling time versus @xmath29 on a logarithmic scale .",
    "remarkably , over the entire parameter range the data collapses in a corridor and can be described by an exponential function of the form : @xmath83 the scaling exponent @xmath6 is found to be @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "this is in reasonable quantitative agreement with the following calculation of the doublon lifetime .",
    "the slight offset between the two spin mixtures in fig .",
    "[ fig3:scalingdata ] could be due to the fact that the absolute values for @xmath1 and @xmath20 differ significantly between the @xmath40 and the @xmath80 mixture @xcite .",
    "whilst the ratio between interaction energy and kinetic energy @xmath29 , which dominates the dynamics , lies in the same range , the absolute values also matter in an inhomogeneous system . for the @xmath80 mixture the higher ratio of chemical potential to on - site interaction",
    "is expected to lead to a higher filling in the trap centre and consequently to a higher equilibrium double occupancy @xmath86 than for the @xmath40 mixture .",
    "it is conceivable that this difference modifies the dynamics of doublon creation and doublon relaxation .    in additional measurements we examined the dependence of the doublon lifetime on the initial double occupancy @xmath87 and on the total atom number @xmath88 . in the former case , we reduced the lattice modulation amplitude from 10% to 5% , resulting in @xmath89 instead of @xmath90 , while keeping all other parameters constant with @xmath91 .",
    "the measured lifetimes agree within the error bars , they are @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . in the latter case , we prepared two otherwise identical samples at @xmath94 with @xmath95 atoms and with @xmath96 atoms , respectively , yielding @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "this shows that , although there is a dependence on the total density and on the doublon density , these effects are small compared to the dominant scaling with @xmath29 .",
    "their systematic study is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "we consider the decay of an isolated doublon moving in the homogeneous background of a compressible state of single fermions . before constructing a model for doublon decay ,",
    "we focus on the dominant mechanism of decay . in the experiments , lattice modulation created @xmath103 double occupancies . assuming an initial half - filled system , half the amount of holes were also created in the system . at these hole densities ,",
    "the kinetic energy assisted decay scaling as @xmath104 is much faster than the spin fluctuation or doublon - doublon collision assisted decay which scale as @xmath105 @xcite . further",
    ", the population of higher bands can be excluded , since @xmath1 is always smaller than half the band gap .",
    "we also note that as the difference between @xmath1 and the chemical potential is always positive , confinement assisted decay of doublons near the edge of the cloud is unlikely , as the accessible confinement energy is not very large , and the tunneling rate is very small . finally , a homogeneous compressible background is justified since most of the doublons are created in the central region of the trap , where the filling is highest , and decay at most within a few sites of where they are produced the estimated travel distance for a random walk during the decay process is not more than @xmath106 sites , which is less than the cloud radius .    in our experiments ,",
    "the doublons and holes are created at finite density by driving the system with optical lattice modulations .",
    "the relaxation of the system to equilibrium involves two very different time scales .",
    "the first timescale is associated with the relaxation of holes and doublons to a state of quasi - equilibrium without the decay of doublons .",
    "the second timescale , which is the focus of this paper , is associated with the decay of doublons into singles .",
    "we expect that the second timescale is much slower than the first .",
    "moreover , we expect that non - linear effects of doublon decay as doublon - doublon scattering can be neglected since their kinetic energy @xmath107 is small .",
    "thus in this paper we consider the problem of the decay of a single doublon in the background of equilibrated fermions .",
    "to construct our model hamiltonian , we explicitly treat the doublon as a separate entity from the background fermions .",
    "this approximation is justified in the strongly interacting limit due to the separation of doublon and background fermion time - scales .",
    "we split the complete hamiltonian of the system into three parts @xmath108 where @xmath109 describes the background fermion subsystem  which we model as the projected fermi sea , @xmath110 describes the on - site interaction of the pair of fermions that make up a doublon , and @xmath111 describes the fermion - doublon interaction .",
    "the details of how to separate the fermi - hubbard hamiltonian into the above three parts via projection operators are discussed in appendix  [ appendix : model ] .",
    "the projection operators induce interactions in the fermion subsystem as well as between the fermions and the doublons .",
    "the fermion doublon interactions are responsible for the doublon decay , and the fermion - fermion interactions modify the lifetime substantially .    as mentioned above , we expect hole density in these systems to be @xmath112 . at such high hole densities",
    "the projected fermi sea is a good approximation for the background state .",
    "further the temperature of the system is high enough ( @xmath113 ) to prevent formation of more ordered states like superfluids .    except for the single doublon that is undergoing decay ,",
    "the large energy cost of double occupancies is taken into account by projecting out configurations with double occupancies from a simple fermi sea . in the projected subspace",
    ", the fermions can only hop in the presence of empty sites ( holes ) and are governed by the effective hamiltonian @xmath114 where @xmath115 creates a fermion with spin @xmath116 , @xmath117 is the corresponding number operator , and @xmath118 is the chemical potential . expanding out the hamiltonian one gets @xmath119 , with @xmath120 where we have replaced @xmath2 by @xmath121 in the second term .",
    "@xmath121 will be treated as a perturbation parameter to organize the calculation but we will put @xmath122 at the end of the calculation .",
    "@xmath123 , coming from the projection operators can thus be interpreted as a fermion - fermion scattering term which leads to the creation of particle - hole pairs .",
    "we thus see that projection induces interaction between the fermions .",
    "we note that the scattering is always between fermions of opposite spins .",
    "since we will be interested in calculating feynman diagrams , we note that the interaction vertex for the fermion fermion scattering can be written as @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are momenta of the incoming and outgoing fermion with the same spin and @xmath127 in @xmath128 dimensions .",

    "the doublon ( @xmath133 ) and fermion - doublon ( @xmath134 ) hamiltonians can be written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 stands for the hermitian conjugate of the preceding term .",
    "the doublon interacts with the fermions in two different ways : ( i ) it can scatter off a fermion leading to the hopping of doublons with back - flow of fermions ; ( ii ) it can decay by creating a singlet particle - particle pair .",
    "the interaction vertices of the doublon with the fermions are given in second and third rows of table  [ table : rules ] .",
    "the vertex for scattering off particle - hole pairs is @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the momentum of the incoming doublon , @xmath139 is the momentum of the outgoing fermion and @xmath125 the momentum of the outgoing hole .",
    "the corresponding vertex for decay through singlet creation is given by @xmath140 where @xmath125 and @xmath141 are the momenta of the fermions created .",
    "we assume that we are looking at the decay of a single doublon i.e. while the doublon is affected by the presence of the background fermions , the fermions are unaffected by the presence of the doublon .",
    "the motivation for this assumption is that the experimentally observed decay rate depends only weakly on the doublon density .",
    "our strategy for finding the lifetime of a doublon is to calculate the doublon green function @xmath142^{-1 } , \\label{eq : dbl_gfn}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the self - energy arising from interaction with fermions .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy at @xmath144 then gives the decay rate @xmath145 and its inverse is the required lifetime @xmath146 .",
    "since we are interested in the high frequency response , the momentum dependence of the self energy should be negligible in this limit .",
    "we perform the calculation at @xmath147 , where the relation between imaginary part of the self - energy and decay rate is exact . at finite temperatures",
    "@xmath148 has an extra contribution due to scattering on particle - hole pairs created by thermal fluctuations .",
    "thus , we must compute the scattering rate separately , and subtract it from @xmath148 to obtain the decay rate .",
    "however , since we are looking at frequencies @xmath3 , ignoring thermal fluctuations is justified for @xmath149 , which is the regime of interest .    physically , there are two important processes for the doublon decay",
    ". a doublon can lose its energy either by creating a large number of particle - hole pairs , each with an energy @xmath150 , or by creating a few high energy particle - hole pairs , each of which is unstable and creates a shower of particle hole pairs of low energies .",
    "the first process is a high order diagram in the doublon self - energy while the second process comes from high order diagrams in the fermion self - energy .",
    "we find that combinations of both processes give important contributions to the doublon decay rate .        the typical doublon self - energy diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cutdiagram ] ) depicts a process of creation of a number of particle and hole excitations .",
    "since we are interested in the imaginary part of the self energy at @xmath151 , the fermion lines crossing the dashed line which cuts the diagram in half should be on - shell and their energies must add up to @xmath1 .",
    "the leading order contributions to the decay rate thus come from the diagrams which maximize the number of fermions that cross the dashed line while minimizing the number of interaction vertices .    our approach for obtaining the doublon self energy consists of ( 1 )  obtaining the projected fermi sea green function , and ( 2 )  using it to obtain the doublon self - energy .",
    "we make the dilute doublon approximation , and assume that the fermion green function is independent of the doublon green function .",
    "we proceed by formulating a diagrammatic resummation technique for the doublon self - energy in the following subsection . in doing so",
    ", we relate the doublon self - energy to the fermion green function , which we calculate in the next two subsections .      for large @xmath8",
    ", doublon decays into a large number of particle - hole pairs , and therefore one needs to compute high order diagrams to obtain the doublon self - energy ( for creation of @xmath22 pairs , one needs to compute @xmath152 diagrams ) .",
    "it is then much preferable to resum a class of diagrams , rather than evaluate an exponentially increasing number of them .",
    "we use a self - consistent non - crossing approximation to achieve this resummation .",

    "[ fig : doublongf ] , where the doublon lines with squiggles represent the full doublon green function to be obtained self - consistently and the thick single lines are the fermion propagators .    at this point , we make an additional approximation , and replace the @xmath125-dependent vertex functions @xmath153 by momentum averaged vertex functions @xmath154 listed in table  [ table : rules ] .",

    "<S> these systems , which can simulate strongly interacting model hamiltonians , are essentially decoupled from external heat baths and hence the intrinsic non - equilibrium dynamics of the system can be studied easily . compared to condensed matter systems , the low density in these systems results in long timescales for dynamics . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the system can be followed in real time without the use of ultrafast probes . </S>",
    "<S> further , it is relatively easy to create and characterize an initial state far from the ground state , which is crucial since the dynamics depends heavily on the initial state .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , questions of non - equilibrium dynamics and thermalization timescales are particularly important for these artificially engineered strongly correlated systems . their key feature is the precise tunability of the hamiltonian parameters which has made these systems ideal for the simulation of strongly interacting many - body hamiltonians relevant to condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , an implicit assumption in this comparison is that the system is in thermal equilibrium at low temperatures . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it is important to estimate the thermalization timescales as these systems are always characterized by a finite sample lifetime . besides </S>",
    "<S> , several proposed methods to prepare the system in novel phases explicitly depend on adiabatic tuning of hamiltonian parameters , which place stronger constraints on the possible sweep rates than mere demand of thermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> an important class of non - equilibrium problems is the decay of a high energy excitation into low energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this problem occurs in diverse contexts like multi - phonon decay of excitons in semiconductors  @xcite , pump and probe experiments  @xcite and dynamics of nuclear resonances  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study this problem in the non - equilibrium dynamics of artificially created double occupancies in the fermi hubbard model in the strongly interacting regime . specifically , we will look at the mechanism of doublon decay in this system and the relation of the doublon lifetime to the repulsive interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we study this dynamics both experimentally using ultracold fermions on an optical lattice  @xcite and theoretically using a projected fermion model and diagrammatic resummations .    </S>",
    "<S> the doublon lifetime has practical implications for the sweep rates of hamiltonian parameters in cold atom systems in the following way : the usual access to the strongly interacting regime is to start with a weakly interacting system and increase the ratio of interaction @xmath1 to the hopping energy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as this ratio increases , the density of doublons in the system in equilibrium should decrease . </S>",
    "<S> thus the doublon lifetime provides the dominant equilibration timescale for the system . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that this problem has structural similarities with the decay of a deeply bound excitonic state through multi - phonon processes in semi - conductors  @xcite , but as we shall see , the strong hubbard repulsion modifies the situation in an essential way .    </S>",
    "<S> our main results are ( i ) the decay of a doublon is a slow process as the doublon needs to distribute a large energy ( @xmath3 ) to other excitations in the system which have a much smaller energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the primary mode of decay of the doublon involves creation of particle - hole pairs in the background system . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the decay rate scales as @xmath4 and the decay becomes slower with increasing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath5 and @xmath6 from experiments and from theoretical calculation . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) we find that the interactions between pairs of single fermions , which in our model are induced by projection , are important and quantitatively affect the timescale of the decay . </S>",
    "<S> thus the strongly correlated character of the system changes the dynamics in an essential way .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : in section i we discuss the various possible decay mechanisms of the doublon in these systems and give a scaling argument for the decay rate in each case . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii we describe the experiments and its results . in section iii </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the most relevant decay mechanism in our experiments and develop the theoretical model for doublon decay . in section </S>",
    "<S> iv we outline the diagrammatic method to compute the doublon lifetime . in section </S>",
    "<S> v we discuss the theoretical results and its comparison with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude in section vi by discussing the importance of these results and future directions . </S>",
    "<S> the technical details of the theory are described in relevant appendices . </S>"
