    "we use density functional theory ( dft ) to investigate the cubic to rhombohedral structural phase transition which has been established by x - ray diffraction @xcite . many trifluoride mf@xmath0 compounds ( m = al , cr , fe , ga , in , ti , v ) exhibit this structural phase transition @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the observed transition in tif@xmath0 is of a ferroelastic nature @xcite . in most of those materials except for tif@xmath0 and mnf@xmath0 there are no partly filled @xmath11 shells .",
    "the driving mechanism for the ferroelastic transitions can be pictured as the formation of the dipole moments on fluorine atoms due to the asymmetric distribution of the @xmath12 electron density in the distorted structure .",
    "the long range dipole - dipole interaction favors a distorted structure with anti - polar arrangement of dipoles @xcite .",
    "the local density approximation ( lda ) captures both the long - range and the short interactions on the same footing and predicts a distorted structure to have a minimum energy in alf@xmath0 @xcite .    in the present studies we choose the tif@xmath0 system with a partly filed @xmath7 shell .",
    "the jahn - teller energy lowering due to the lifting of the @xmath7 orbital degeneracy in the distorted structure should add up to the long range dipole formation energy .",
    "unexpectedly , we find the total energies of the high and low temperature phases to be identical within the errors of calculations . the failure of lda to explain this phase transition is due to the fact that transition metal @xmath11 electrons are not adequately described by lda .",
    "although the dipole - dipole long range interaction favors the distorted structure , however the electron kinetic energy of the @xmath7 one third filled band is increased due the diminishing of the hopping integral ( @xmath13 ) between the neighboring ti atoms due to the octahedra tilting .",
    "the two effects mutually cancel each other resulting in degenerate minimums of the potential energy surface .",
    "it was realized some time ago that lda tends to underestimate the coulomb repulsion of electrons occupying different orbitals of the same @xmath11-shell @xcite . in particular",
    ", this leads to equal occupations of different orbitals of the same manifold and prevents the stabilization of the orbitally ordered solutions .",
    "the lda+u functional , however , generates an orbital dependent potential which favors solutions with broken orbital degeneracy .",
    "lda+u calculations indicate that the low temperature phase has a by about 900k lower energy per tif@xmath0 than the high temperature phase .",
    "one of the roles of the coulomb interaction is to suppresses the electron kinetic energy of the partly filled @xmath7 bands .",
    "the bandwidth narrowing in the distorted structure effectively reduces the restoring force to rotate the octahedra which facilitate stabilization of the distorted structure .",
    "the electronic ground state is orbitally ordered in the low temperature phase with one electron occupying the a@xmath14 orbital oriented along the rhombohedral direction forming a heisenberg spin 1/2 lattice coupled antiferromagnetically to its neighbors _ via _ a superexchange mechanism .    in this work",
    "we use the molecular nrlmol code @xcite to calculate @xmath15 by varying the occupation number of the ti @xmath11 orbital of the tif@xmath3 ion .",
    "these calculations are significantly less computationally demanding compared to the supercell approaches @xciteand since only the first neighboring fluorines mostly contribute to the screening a good estimate for parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be readily achieved in the calculations .    the hund interaction and the electron kinetic energy are realistically described with lda . the tif@xmath0 compound is predicted to be a ferromagnetic metal with a fully saturated magnetic moment of 1 @xmath17 per formula unit .",
    "the exchange hund energy is large and the stoner criterium is satisfied .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction lifts the on site degeneracy of the @xmath7 orbitals and for a sufficiently strong coupling a gap in the spectrum can open .",
    "we estimate the electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath18 2 mev / degree ) to be insignificant to open the gap and to drive the phase transition in tif@xmath0 .",
    "although the on - site coulomb correlations are important , the direction of the t2g - level splitting is determined by the long range dipole - dipole interaction @xcite . many successes and failures of lsda in transition metal oxide compounds",
    "have been summarized , for example , in the review article @xcite .",

    "<S> we use first principles density functional theory to calculate electronic and magnetic properties of tif@xmath0 using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method . </S>",
    "<S> the lda approximation predicts a fully saturated ferromagnetic metal and finds degenerate energy minima for high and low symmetry structures . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed jahn - teller phase transition at t@xmath1=370k can not be driven by the electron - phonon interaction alone , which is usually described accurately by lda . </S>",
    "<S> electron correlations beyond lda are essential to lift the degeneracy of the singly occupied ti t@xmath2 orbital . although the on - site coulomb correlations are important , the direction of the t2g - level splitting is determined by the dipole - dipole interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the lda+u functional predicts an aniferromagnetic insulator with an orbitally ordered ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the input parameters u=8.1 ev and j=0.9 ev for the ti 3d orbital were found by varying the total charge on the tif@xmath3 ion using the molecular nrlmol code . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the heisenberg exchange constant for spin-1/2 on a cubic lattice to be approximately 24 k. the symmetry lowering energy in lda+u is about 900 k per tif@xmath0 formula unit . </S>"
