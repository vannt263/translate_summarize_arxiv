    "<S> the rtf and retf values of @xmath33 and @xmath14 for a given parameter set are , in general , rather different from one another , which means that the precise value of these quantities is model dependent . </S>",

    "<S> ( a similar situation is found for the total energy of finite nuclei @xcite . ) these trends , of course , are also reflected in @xmath61 . </S>",

    "<S> a similar behaviour is displayed by the self - consistent values of @xmath14 , although the crossing point between the rtf and retf predictions is shifted to a larger value of @xmath68 ( around 280 mev ) due to the fact that the contribution proportional to @xmath16 ( @xmath61 ) is larger in the rtf approach than in the retf approach for the parameter sets considered here .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath33 values obtained from the pocket formula eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqfn7 ] ) using the surface diffuseness of the rtf or retf semi - infinite nuclear matter density profiles also decrease with @xmath2 , though the estimate provided by eq . </S>",

    "<S> it should also be pointed out that in our self - consistent semiclassical calculations we find that the ratio between the surface and bulk incompressibilities increases with @xmath2 ( in agreement with the results of @xcite ) . in the retf case </S>",
    "<S> this ratio is close to one , as happens for the non - relativistic skyrme forces @xcite , provided that the bulk incompressibility @xmath2 of the interaction is not excessively high . in the rtf case the ratio between the surface and bulk incompressibilities increases much faster with @xmath2 than in the retf calculations , and it considerably differs from unity for parametrizations with either a very low or a very high bulk incompressibility . in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath73 as a function of @xmath2 for the parameter sets considered in table 1 . as in the non - relativistic case @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath14 varies roughly linearly with @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . a linear fit of all the points gives @xmath74 in the retf model and @xmath75 in the rtf model . </S>",
    "<S> if only the non - linear parametrizations are included in the fit one obtains @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the retf and rtf cases , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface incompressibility coefficient is both large and negative , thus its contribution considerably reduces the finite nucleus incompressibility @xmath0 with respect to the nuclear matter limit @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this result , although obtained in the scaling model , illustrates the physical effect that the compression of the surface provides a considerable reduction of @xmath0 , which is also found in more fundamental rpa calculations @xcite . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have self - consistently computed the finite nucleus incompressibility @xmath0 using the retf approach and the scaling method which we have employed in the present work to obtain @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> it can be seen that the leptodermous expansion with the terms given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqfn2 ] ) fails to describe small nuclei and also very asymmetric nuclei such as @xmath84sn or @xmath86pb . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , some words of caution should be said about the coulomb term in eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eqfn2 ] ) overestimates this change by approximately 6 mev for nl1 , 3 mev for nl3 and 1 mev for nl - sh .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eqfn2 ] ) improves the agreement with the @xmath0 results calculated self - consistently . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath2 is the nuclear matter incompressibility given in table 1 and @xmath87 are the self - consistent incompressibilities calculated for @xmath6 ranging from 300 up to 300000 . in the linear fit of these curves the @xmath93axis </S>",

    "<S> the estimates of the curvature term in the leptodermous expansion of the finite nucleus incompressibility obtained with nl1 , nl3 and nl - sh are @xmath95317.2 , @xmath95229.8 and @xmath95185.6 mev respectively .    to obtain the surface - symmetry contribution , </S>",
    "<S> we have found it convenient to parametrize the difference between the self - consistent incompressibilities @xmath0 of a given nucleus with neutron excess @xmath96 and the corresponding symmetric nucleus as : @xmath97 where again uncharged nuclei have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> for each parameter set and according to ( [ eqfn15 ] ) , if @xmath98i^{-2}$ ] is plotted versus @xmath92 a unique curve should be found which is independent of the value of i. however , one obtains a family of almost parallel lines whose slope is @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of these lines gives us information on the higher order symmetry contributions missed in the parametrization ( [ eqfn15 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we will estimate the surface - symmetry term from a linear fit of the curve corresponding to @xmath100 , which roughly corresponds to an average asymmetry along the periodic table . </S>",
