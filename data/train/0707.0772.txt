    "methods coming from random matrix theory , as developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    ", allow us to derive precise conjectures for the moments of those regulators .",
    "our hope is that these moments will help to make predictions for the number of curves with extra - rank ( i.e. the number of even quadratic twists is a quadratic twist such that the sign of the functional equation of its @xmath2-function is @xmath3 ( resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) . by the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture",
    "this is equivalent to say that its mordell - weil rank is odd ( resp . even ) ] with a mordell - weil rank @xmath5 , or the number of odd quadratic twists with mordell - weil rank @xmath6 ) .",
    "then , we describe an efficient method , using heegner - point construction , for computing the regulator ( and the order of the tate - shafarevich group ) of an elliptic curve of rank 1 in a family of quadratic twists .",
    "finally , we discuss and compare our extensive numerical data ( for some families of odd quadratic twists of the curves @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) with our predictions .    from a numerical and experimental point of view , the situation of odd quadratic twists really differs from the one of even quadratic twists .",
    "indeed , in the latter case , for each curve @xmath11 in a family @xmath12 of even quadratic twists of a fixed elliptic curve @xmath0 , one has to compute the special value @xmath13 of its @xmath2-function at @xmath14 and determine if it is zero or not . if @xmath15 then the curve @xmath11 has extra - rank .",
    "otherwise the curve has rank @xmath16 , the regulator is simply @xmath17 , and the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture allows us to deduce the value of @xmath18 from that of @xmath13 . the computation of @xmath13 is done via a waldspurger s formula which , roughly speaking , states that @xmath13 is , up to a fudge factor , the square of the @xmath19-th coefficient of a weight @xmath20 modular form given by an explicit linear combination of theta series .",
    "it follows that , in this case , computations are possible for very large families of quadratic twists ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "note that the numerical data coming from these computations are in close agreement with the well - known conjectures of @xcite about extra - vanishing ( coming from the models of random matrix theory ) , or on the behavior of the tate - shafarevich groups @xmath21 of @xmath11 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the rank 1 case",
    ", numerical investigation appears to be much more complicated and , as far as we know , has never been done before . in that case , we first have to compute the value of the derivative @xmath22 for each curve @xmath11 in the family of odd quadratic twists .",
    "however , there is no waldspurger s formula to compute this value directly , and furthermore from this value one can only deduce ( assuming it is non - zero and under the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture ) the value of the product @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the regulator of @xmath11 . thus we also need to be able to evaluate at least one of the two terms of this product .",
    ", there exists a generic point in the mordell - weil group @xmath25 , thus one can separate the terms in this product and a direct investigation is possible ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , such families for which we know in advance the regulator are very special and in particular are not quadratic families , although we must say that it is possible to get sometimes a generic point for some very specific and tiny sub - family of quadratic twists . ] the only ( known ) efficient way to do this is to write down a generator @xmath26 of @xmath27 and to compute @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the canonical height of @xmath11 .",
    "the method we used in this paper is to first adapt the heegner - point construction to our situation in order to construct a generator @xmath26 and then replace the waldspurger s formula by the formula of gross and zagier .",
    "this allows us to compute directly the regulator @xmath24 _ and at the same time _",

    ", we assume the truth of the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture . *    we now give some notations .",
    "fix an elliptic curve @xmath0 defined over @xmath1 and let @xmath30 be its conductor .",
    "the @xmath2-function of @xmath0 is @xmath31 it is now a classical and deep result that @xmath32 can be analytically continued to the whole complex plane and satisfies a functional equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 gives the parity of the order of vanishing of @xmath32 at @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a fundamental discriminant .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the quadratic twist of @xmath0 by @xmath35 .",
    "the curves @xmath0 and @xmath11 are isomorphic over the quadratic field @xmath36 but not over @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath37 ( @xmath38 if @xmath35 is clear in the context ) the isomorphism between @xmath0 and @xmath11 defined in the following way .",
    "assume that the curves @xmath0 and @xmath11 are given by : @xmath39 then @xmath37 is : @xmath40 the non - trivial automorphism @xmath41 of @xmath36 , which is the restriction of the complex conjugation if @xmath42 , acts by : @xmath43    whenever @xmath35 and @xmath30 are coprime ( and this will always be the case in our families ) , the conductor of @xmath11 is @xmath44 and we have : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the quadratic character associated to @xmath35 .",
    "the sign of the functional equation satisfied by @xmath47 is @xmath48 in the odd rank case ( i.e. @xmath49 ) , we are interested in the values at @xmath14 of the derivatives of the @xmath2-functions .",
    "we have : @xmath50 where as usual @xmath51 is the real period , @xmath24 is the regulator and @xmath52 is the product of the local tamagawa numbers .",
    "the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture predicts that @xmath53 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 otherwise .",
    "for each prime @xmath56 dividing the conductor @xmath30 of @xmath0 , we fix a sign @xmath57 so that @xmath58 .",
    "we then define the set : @xmath59 and we let : @xmath60 then , our family of quadratic twists is the set @xmath61 and , for all these curves",
    "@xmath11 , we have @xmath49 by the above assumption on the product of the @xmath62 s",
    ". it will be convenient for us to partition the family @xmath63 into two subfamilies corresponding to the odd and even discriminant cases .",
    "therefore we define : @xmath64 note that we will not need to consider the subfamilies corresponding to the even discriminants .    for @xmath65 with @xmath19 large enough",
    ", it follows from proposition 2 of @xcite that , if we denote by @xmath66 the usual invariant of @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we have : @xmath67 where @xmath68 if @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and @xmath71 otherwise , and @xmath72 is some positive number which does not depend on @xmath35 . when @xmath22 is not zero then @xmath27 has rank 1 and the regulator @xmath24 is equal to the canonical height @xmath73 of a generator @xmath26 of @xmath11 .",
    "so , the problem of studying the behavior of @xmath24 is roughly speaking the same as the one of studying the complexity of rational solutions of the associated diophantine equations .",
    "lang s conjecture ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 10.2 ) predicts that for a general elliptic curve @xmath0 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the minimal discriminant of @xmath0 . in our family , we have @xmath77 hence , this yields : @xmath78 of course , this upper bound is very far from what we really expect for our family .",
    "indeed , using equation  ( [ sr ] ) and the fact that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are positive integers ( so greater or equal to 1 ) , the lindelf hypothesis applied to @xmath22 gives the following conditional upper bound : @xmath81    in some cases , this upper bound can be proved on average .",
    "anticipating on the results and notations of section  [ algo ] , we prove :    [ apres ] assume that @xmath30 is square - free , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",

    "now , we apply the corollaire 3.2 of @xcite .",
    "classical conjectures predict that the number of discriminants @xmath35 in our family for which @xmath89 should have density @xmath16 ( we will come back to this fact later ) , so @xmath90 is roughly the number of terms in the sum of the formula above and hence the proposition really asserts that on average @xmath91 for all @xmath92 .",
    "another conjecture of lang asserts that @xmath93 in fact , we have the more precise result :    [ explicite ] if @xmath94 , @xmath95 , then there is an explicit constant @xmath96 , depending on @xmath0 and on the @xmath62 , such that we have for all @xmath97 : @xmath98 if @xmath83 for all @xmath99 , then one can take @xmath100",
    ".    we estimate @xmath101 where @xmath80 is the local tamagawa number at the prime @xmath56 dividing @xmath102 .",

    "if @xmath109 , then @xmath80 is either @xmath17 , @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath112 now , the result follows using corollaire 2.2 of @xcite and the fact that @xmath113 .       1 .   with the same techniques , we can obtain similar results for @xmath114 or  @xmath95 .",
    "2 .   one can prove ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 8.17 ) ) the following lower bound : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is some constant depending on @xmath0 .",
    "the factor @xmath117 in this formula is much better than the factor @xmath118 in proposition [ explicite ] .",
    "however , the constant @xmath116 ( which comes from the difference between the naive and the canonical heights ) is negative and thus the estimate   is useless for small @xmath35 ( and in practice for all the @xmath35 s we are dealing with ) . on the other hand , the estimate of proposition  [ explicite ] is good enough for our applications and has no consequence on the main complexity of our method .",
    "the lower bound in proposition [ explicite ] is optimal in the following sense : suppose that @xmath0 is given by the equation @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a degree @xmath121 polynomial .",
    "then , one can easily check that the point @xmath122 belongs to @xmath123 and that the height of this point is @xmath124 .",
    "one expect much better lower bounds on average : it is proved in @xcite that predictions coming from random matrix theory for derivatives of @xmath2-functions ( see @xcite ) and cohen - lenstra type heuristics for tate - shafarevich groups ( see @xcite ) imply that for @xmath125 : @xmath126          $ \\scriptscriptstyle d\\in{\\mathcal f}(t ) $ \\\\          [ -2mm]$\\scriptscriptstyle l^\\prime(e_d,1)\\neq 0 $        \\end{tabular}}}\\hspace*{-4 mm } \\hat{h}(g_d)^k \\gg t^{k/2-\\epsilon}\\ ] ] where the implied constant depends on @xmath0 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .      for @xmath125",

    "the number @xmath140 comes from the contribution of the tamagawa numbers in the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture .",

    "if @xmath0 has exactly one rational 2-torsion point ( and no isogenous curve has full 2-torsion ) then @xmath142 .    for the other cases , we need to make the rather technical assumption that our restrictions on the discriminants are not incompatible with the use of the chebotarev density theorem ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the numerical data seems to support this fact . on the other hand , extensive numerical computations by watkins",
    "@xcite seem to indicate otherwise .",
    "indeed we want to emphasize that one has always to be careful with deducing too strong of statements from numerical investigations .",
    "we need to make a certain number of restrictions in order to be able to apply the method described in this section .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath0 is the strong weil curve in its isogeny class ( in fact , we just need that the manin s constant of @xmath0 is equal to @xmath17 ) and that @xmath157 , @xmath95 .",
    "these are just technical and not essential assumptions .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath158 which implies that @xmath159 has rank @xmath16 and that @xmath160 . this is a fundamental assumption and the method would not work without it .",
    "finally , the family of discriminants @xmath63 is obtained by taking @xmath83 for all @xmath161 .",
    "hence , @xmath49 and @xmath35 is a square modulo @xmath162 for all @xmath163 .",

    "hence , we really need to be careful in all the steps of the method in order to be as efficient as possible .",

    "we find that the point @xmath240 is divisible by @xmath110 , more precisely @xmath288 , so that @xmath289 with @xmath290 .",
    "we then easily check that the point @xmath291 is not divisible by any prime @xmath292 in the group @xmath27 , hence one can take @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",

    "we have computed , using the method described in the previous section , the regulators and the order of the tate - shafarevich groups of the twists @xmath11 of @xmath0 of the four elliptic curves @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and for all available discriminants @xmath296 with @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "we discuss in this section the data we obtained and compare it with the heuristics .",
    "all the computations have been performed using the pari / gp system @xcite and the data is available at      we begin with the curves of prime conductor ( @xmath7 and @xmath10 ) since for the last two curves ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , the congruence conditions are more restrictive and therefore the number of discriminants in @xmath297 is quite small compared to @xmath298 .",
    "we have @xmath306 and there is no curve in its isogeny class having rational 2-torsion .",
    "hence the heuristics predict that : @xmath307 for some constant @xmath139 .",
    "we computed @xmath139 numerically to fit the data ( values found : @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 ) and we plot the graph of the function given by the heuristics and the points @xmath312 for @xmath313 and for @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath17 . as it can been seen the graphs ( see figure  [ 11_moment ] )",

    "note that the graphs of extra - vanishing for the curves 11a1 ( figure  [ 11_extra_vanishing ] ) and 17a1 ( figure  [ 17_extra_vanishing ] ) suggest that the density of extra - vanishing is larger for the twists of 17a1 than for those of 11a1 .",
    "however the asymptotic for the moments of the regulators is smaller ( as @xmath330 ) for 17a1 than for 11a1 which suggest that there are more constraints on the regulators of the twists of 11a1 and thus imply in turn that we should have more extra - vanishing for this family .",
    "in fact , the constants @xmath139 in the asymptotics of @xmath331 are larger for the curve 17a1 , but asymptotics of the functions @xmath331 for the curve 11a1 are larger than for the curve 17a1 for very large values of @xmath167 that are completely out of reach for computations .",
