    "the process of galaxy formation can be divided into two distinct and equally important histories . on the one hand ,",
    "the dynamical history of galaxies is crucial in understanding the hubble sequence ( or other morphological classifications ) that we see now as well as its evolution with redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "the star formation history allows us to trace the baryonic matter , its conversion from gas to stars and the feedback from stellar evolution in the processing of subsequent generations of stars .",
    "disk galaxies are assumed to be the building blocks from which the rest of the galactic `` zoo '' we see around us has been assembled .",
    "the standard picture of disk galaxy formation involves the infall and cooling of primordial gas onto the centers of dark matter halos and its later conversion into stars ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "a multitude of models have been published , describing this process in varying degrees of detail , following either a dynamical approach , where gravity plays the dominant role in the properties of galaxies , or a spectrophotometric approach , where the key issue is the highly complex and so far unsolved problem of star formation .",
    "the former approach usually over - simplifies the luminous properties of galaxies by assuming a fixed value of the mass - to - light ratio , tying the properties of the observed parts of galaxies to the behavior of the much larger halos in which the luminous matter is embedded .",
    "on the other hand , models based on the evolution of the stellar populations lack the dynamical information needed in order to quantify the merger tree .",
    "semi - analytic models ( e.g. kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ; baugh et al .",
    "1998 ) attempt to fill in the gap between these two approaches at the expense of a large and complicated set of parameters .",
    "we follow a spectrophotometric approach , defining a model that traces both the evolution of gas and metal content in a simple star formation scenario reduced to infall of primordial gas that fuels star formation via a simple power law dependence on gas content .",
    "the model allows for outflows of gas driven out of the galaxy , whose cause could either be stellar ( feedback from supernova - driven winds ) or dynamical ( e.g. merging or harassment ) . in this paper",
    "we study the evolution of the gas and stellar content in disk galaxies , ignoring size evolution . in a future paper (",
    "ferreras & silk , in preparation ) we use the same model to explore the evolution of sizes and surface brightnesses along with the associated effects on the selection function of current surveys at moderate and high redshift .",
    "the first part of this paper (   2,3,4 ) describes the model as well as the technique used in order to constrain the volume of parameter space sampled . in  5 we discuss the star formation efficiencies predicted by the model .",
    " 6 explores the issue of gas content in disk galaxies and speculates on the idea that a large fraction of gas could be found in the form of cold h@xmath3 .  7 explains the redshift evolution predicted by our model for the star formation rates as well as for the tully - fisher relation . finally  8 is a brief summary of our results with a discussion of the most interesting issues , regarding disk galaxy formation , raised by our work .",
    "we follow a chemical enrichment code similar to the one described in more detail in ferreras & silk ( 2000a , b ) , where the formation and evolution of the stellar populations is parametrized by a range of star formation efficiencies ( @xmath1 ) and outflows ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the model only traces the cold gas component    + 3.3truein    + 0.2truein    that gives rise to star formation , with instantaneous mixing of the ejected gas from stars and the cold gas component being assumed . the gas mass density ( @xmath12 ) and metallicity ( @xmath13 ) obey a simple set of chemical enrichment equations following the formalism of tinsley ( 1980 ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the star formation rate , @xmath16 the gas infall rate , @xmath17 the gas mass ejected from stars of all masses , and @xmath11 is the fraction of gas ejected from the galaxy .",
    "since this paper treats galaxies as unresolved objects , and we do not assume a threshold in density for the star formation rate , we can always interchange mass densities and total masses .",
    "the evolution of the metallicity follows a similar equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the metallicity of the infalling gas ( assumed to be primordial in this paper ) , and @xmath20 is the mass in metals ejected from stars .",
    "infall of primordial gas fuels star formation via a schmidt - type law ( schmidt 1959 ) : @xmath21 where @xmath1 is the star formation efficiency parameter .",
    "we assume either a linear ( @xmath22 ) or a quadratic law ( @xmath23 ) as extreme examples .",
    "the power law index that best fits observational data ( @xmath24 ) lies between these two values ( kennicutt 1998a ) . in the instantaneous recycling approximation  for which the stellar lifetimes are assumed to be either zero or infinity , depending on whether the stellar mass is greater or less than some mass threshold ( @xmath25 )  the star formation rate can be solved analytically ( e.g. tinsley 1980 ) .",
    "taking @xmath22 : @xmath26 @xmath27;\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the returned mass fraction from stars with masses @xmath29 .",
    "hence , the inverse of @xmath1 is roughly the time ( in gyr ) needed to process gas into stars .",
    "the comparison between the efficiency defined here ( @xmath1 ) and observed efficiencies  such as the parameter @xmath30 defined in kennicutt ( 1998b ) with respect to surface densities rather than total masses , i.e. @xmath31  is straightforward without a star formation threshold , but gets rather complicated with such a threshold , which causes @xmath1 to lie systematically below the observed efficiencies by a factor given by the ratio between the surface of the disk with density above threshold with respect to the total area .",
    "if we assume a universal star formation law , one would expect a systematic offset between observed star formation efficiencies and model one - zone efficiencies such as our @xmath1 .",
    "the infall rate that fuels star formation is assumed to have a gaussian profile peaked at an epoch described by a formation redshift parameter ( @xmath32 ) , with two different timescales for ages earlier or later than the time corresponding to that formation redshift , namely : @xmath33 & t",
    "< t(z_f)\\\\ \\exp [ -(t - t(z_f))^2/2\\tau_2 ^ 2 ] & t >",
    "t(z_f).\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    for @xmath34 we assume a short infall timescale  @xmath35  gyr  which results in a prompt enrichment of the interstellar medium and thereby circumvents the g  dwarf problem .",
    "any model of chemical enrichment must avoid the over - production of low metallicity stars by assuming either a non - monotonically decreasing star formation rate ( as in this paper ) or initially non - primordial gas ( pre - enrichment ) . for @xmath36",
    "the infall timescale ( @xmath37 ) is a rough label for disk type : early - type disks will be associated with short timescales ( @xmath38 gyr ) , whereas late - type disks , with more extended star formation histories , correspond to larger values of @xmath37 .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) used is a hybrid between a salpeter ( 1955 ) and a scalo ( 1986 ) imf .",
    "the high - mass end follows a salpeter power law , with upper - mass cutoff at @xmath39 , whereas the low - mass end  truncated at @xmath40  follows the scalo imf .",
    "stellar lifetimes follow a broken power law fit to the data from tinsley ( 1980 ) and schaller et al .",
    "we refer the reader to ferreras & silk ( 2000a , b ) for more details about the chemical enrichment code .    the outflow parameter ( @xmath11 ) is used to quantify the amount of gas ejected out of stars and that leaves the galaxy and does not contribute to the processing of the next generation of stars .",
    "this mechanism plays an important role in the mass - metallicity correlation as originally suggested by larson ( 1974 ) : massive galaxies are expected to retain most of the gas , thereby increasing the average metallicity , whereas the shallow gravitational wells of low - mass galaxies can not prevent enriched gas from being ejected from the galaxy , resulting in lower average metallicities .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the color range found in early - type systems is mostly driven by metallicity    + 3.3truein    + 0.2truein    ( e.g. kodama et al . 1998 ) , and can be explained by a correlation between the outflow parameter ( @xmath11 ) and the total mass of the system ( ferreras & silk 2000b ) .    the chemical enrichment process in galaxies is hence described in this model with a set of five parameters : @xmath41",
    ". only the early - infall timescale  @xmath42  is fixed to 0.5 gyr throughout , whereas the other four parameters are allowed to vary over a large range of values .",
    "every set of parameters chosen describes a star formation history ( @xmath15 , @xmath43 ) which can be used to convolve simple stellar populations in order to find the composite spectral energy distribution of a galaxy whose formation process corresponds to that choice of parameters .",
    "we use the latest population synthesis models from bruzual & charlot ( in preparation ) , which span the range of metallicities @xmath44 and include all phases of stellar evolution , from the zero - age main sequence to supernova explosions for progenitors more massive than @xmath45 , or to the end of the white dwarf cooling sequence for less massive progenitors .",
    "the uncertainties present in population synthesis models ( charlot , worthey & bressan 1996 ) complicate the determination of absolute values for parameters such as stellar ages or star formation efficiencies .",
    "this paper aims at showing _ relative _ values of efficiencies or outflow parameters between galaxies of different masses .",
    "the predicted spectral energy distribution obtained for each point scanned in this large volume of parameter space is matched against observed data so that a map of the parameter range compatible with observations can be drawn . here",
    "we use the tully - fisher relation of disk galaxies in different passbands as a constraint , shown in figure  1 .",
    "the data involve multiband @xmath46 photometry of a sample of disk galaxies in the ursa major cluster ( verheijen 1997 ) .",
    "section  4 describes the comparison in more detail .",
    "+ 3.3truein    + 0.2truein",
    "in order to visualize the role of every parameter used in the chemical enrichment model presented here , we show in figures  2 and 3 the metallicity and age distribution , respectively , for a range of outflows ( @xmath11 ) ; star formation efficiencies ( @xmath1 ) and infall parameters ( @xmath37 , @xmath32 ) . the fiducial set chosen is ( @xmath11,@xmath1,@xmath37,@xmath32)= ( 0,1,1  gyr,2 ) . in each panel ,",
    "one of the parameters is allowed to vary , while keeping the others fixed .",
    "notice the effect of the early - infall timescale ( @xmath42 ) on the metallicity distribution , which avoids the over - production of low metallicity stars .",
    "if we had set the timescale @xmath42 to zero , the metallicity histogram would have been a monotonically decreasing function , peaked at zero metallicity .",
    "closed - box models with constant star formation efficiencies and a standard initial mass function always yield monotonically decreasing star formation rates that over - produce low metallicity stars which contradict observations , both in our local stellar census ( rocha - pinto & maciel 1996 ) as well as in the integrated photometry of bulge - dominated galaxies ( worthey , dorman & jones 1996 ) .",
    "models with pre - enriched gas fuelling star formation generate similar distributions although shifted towards higher abundances .",
    "the photometric predictions of pre - enrichment models can be made compatible with the observations .",
    "however , the metallicity distribution  a monotonically decreasing function with @xmath47 with the maximum at the pre - enriched metallicity  is in disagreement with the observed metallicities of stars in the milky way ( e.g. rocha - pinto & maciel 1996 ) .",
    "however , see rich ( 1990 ) and ibata & gilmore ( 1995 ) , who find an agreement between the prediction of a closed - box model and the distribution in the galactic bulge .",
    "the top left panels of figures  2 and 3 show that a range in outflows  with all the other parameters fixed  does not generate significantly different age distributions .",
    "the net effect of a change in the amount of gas ejected from the galaxy is a shift    + 3.3truein    + 0.2truein    in the average metallicity .",
    "hence , the assumption that an outflow range is the only mechanism driving the luminosity sequence of galaxies results in a pure metallicity sequence . on the other hand , a range of star formation efficiencies generates distributions with different ages and metallicities .",
    "the efficiency parameter sets the clock rate at which stars are being formed from the infalling gas ( equations 4 and 5 ) .",
    "hence , systems with lower efficiencies generate a larger age spread , and lower average metallicities .",
    "finally , the parameters controlling infall ( @xmath37 and @xmath32 ) simply shift the age distributions without a significant change in the metallicities , as expected , since @xmath11 and @xmath1 are the only parameters driving the chemical enrichment process : it is possible to re - define the time variable as @xmath48 and solve similar chemical enrichment equations to ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with respect to variable @xmath49 , without any significant dependence on the infall parameters ( @xmath37 and @xmath32 ) .    a comparison of the age and metallicity histograms with the observed mass - metallicity correlation found in disk galaxies ( zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 ) suggests that either outflows and/or star formation efficiencies must be strongly correlated with galaxy mass .",
    "however , one can not determine _ a priori _ whether the observed color range found in disks is purely driven by outflows ( i.e. a metallicity sequence ) or by efficiency ( i.e. a mixed age @xmath50 metallicity sequence ) .",
    "the work described here follows a `` backwards '' approach in that we apply correlations between observables in local galaxies as a constraint and use the chemical enrichment code in order    + 3.3truein    + 0.2truein    to evolve the system backwards in time . for disk galaxies",
    "the obvious constraint to be used is the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) : this shows a tight correlation between the disk rotation velocity  which is a measure of the ratio between the mass and the size of the galaxy  and the absolute luminosity .",
    "the scatter of this correlation is rather small ( @xmath51 mag ) which allows it to be used as a distance indicator with uncertainties as low as 10% , notwithstanding unknown systematic effects ( e.g. jacoby et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the small scatter hides a fundamental connection between the dynamical evolution of disk galaxies and their star formation histories . the analogous correlation for bulges or early - type systems  the faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) between luminosity and velocity dispersion of the spheroid",
    " has a larger scatter , a clear sign of a more complex dynamical evolution .",
    "the conventional scenario for disk formation via infall of gas onto the centers of dark matter halos gives a qualitative idea of the trend followed by the tully - fisher relation : massive disks ( which have faster rotation velocities ) will create more stars , thereby having higher luminosities than low - mass systems .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis of the tully - fisher relation  including disk sizes which of course affect the measured rotation velocity  shows that the interpretation of the slope and zero point of the tully - fisher relation is more complicated .",
    "many dynamical models assume constant mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath52 ) , an incorrect assumption unless only stellar populations of the same ages dominate the light from all disks .",
    "the tully - fisher relation observed through near - infrared passbands minimizes the effect of the chemical enrichment history , and so @xmath53-band is the preferred filter in order to use the correlation as a distance indicator .",
    "rather than exploring a suitable way of finding a `` distilled '' tully - fisher relation that is independent of the formation process , we will use the correlation in different filters in order to constrain the star formation history of disk galaxies .",
    "there are many samples of disk galaxies for which rotation curves have been observed using different techniques such as optical emission lines ( mathewson & ford 1996 ) or the 21  cm line of atomic hydrogen ( giovanelli et al .",
    "we use the sample of disk galaxies in the ursa major cluster ( tully et al .",

    "we explore four different formation redshifts ( @xmath57 ) and four different infall timescales ( @xmath58  gyr ) , corresponding to a range of galaxy types : from early - type disks such as s0 , sa  for @xmath38  gyr  to late - type systems such as sd for longer timescales . for every pair of values describing infall ( @xmath59 ) we scan a grid of @xmath60 star formation efficiencies and outflow fractions over the following range :    @xmath61 + @xmath62 .    for every choice of parameters ,",

    "a major consequence of the large range in star formation efficiencies found with respect to rotational velocity is that low - mass systems will have a broader distribution of stellar ages .",
    "this implies a stronger evolution in luminosity with lookback time .",
    "furthermore , a low efficiency will yield a constant and low star formation rate with redshift . on the other hand",

    "this difference in @xmath70 gets narrower at high redshifts , explained by the fact that the increase in the specific sfr in galaxies with a high efficiency will evolve faster with lookback time , whereas low - mass systems  with low values of @xmath1  feature a low and nearly constant sfr .    the estimates of stellar mass and star formation rates of a sample of field galaxies from the canada france redshift survey and from the hubble deep field north and its flanking fields",

    "the ongoing star formation rate is computed from the flux of the [ ] emission line .",
    "the sample is divided in figure  8 with respect to stellar mass , so that galaxies with masses larger ( smaller ) than the median ( @xmath75 ) are represented by squares ( stars ) .",
    "the bottom panels only show one typical error bar to avoid crowding the figure . taking the model predictions at face value",
    ", one would explain the lack of data points in the bottom right portion of the top panels by a selection bias of the sample which would have to be missing systems with low rotational velocities ( or faint absolute luminosities ) at high redshift .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the region with @xmath76 is mainly populated by massive galaxies .",
    "brinchmann & ellis ( 2000 ) find a significant increase in the specific star formation rate with redshift , shown in the bottom panels of figure  9 as big circles with error bars .",
    "the points are the values at @xmath77 of the best fit found in the redshift bins represented by the horizontal error bars .",
    "the values for higher ( lower ) mass systems will roughly shift linearly to lower ( higher ) specific sfrs .",
    "hence , this fits into our model by assuming a correlation between stellar mass and infall parameters , so that galaxies with more extended star formation histories should correspond to low - mass systems and vice versa .",
    "the redshift evolution of the tully - fisher relation is another interesting issue which becomes possible to quantify with recent observations of the rotation curves of disk galaxies at moderate and high redshift ( vogt et al .",
    "the power of an analysis including star formation lies in the ability to predict relative changes in luminosity evolution caused by a different age distribution of the stellar populations .",
    "in contrast to semi - analytic modellers who are more concerned with the evolution of the zero point of the tully - fisher relation , we can `` turn the crank '' of our model  which is constrained at zero redshift by the local tully - fisher relation  backwards in time and find luminosity changes as a function of galaxy mass .",

    "the steepening of the slope is a consequence of the very low star formation efficiencies at the low - mass end , which imply a broader distribution of stellar ages .",
    "models based on simple arguments of structure formation fail to include the effect of the evolution of the stellar populations .",
    "hence , the prediction of mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) , who tie the evolution of the luminous component in disks to the parameters defining the dark matter halo in which they are embedded , uses a scaling argument to find a constant @xmath83 , obviously regardless of passband and therefore inconsistent with the observations .",

    "in this paper we have presented a phenomenological approach to galaxy formation which reduces the process of star formation to a set of a few parameters controlling the infall of primordial gas , the efficiency of processing gas to form stars , and the fraction of gas and metals that are ejected from the galaxy .",

    "furthermore , the low outflow fractions found in disks for any galaxy mass enable us to reject supernova - driven winds as an important mechanism for driving gas and metals out of the interstellar medium of galaxies , in agreement with the hydrodynamic simulations of mclow & ferrara ( 1999 ) and the modelling of star formation in dwarf galaxies by ferrara & tolstoy ( 2000 ) .",

    "this issue has important implications not only for galaxy formation but also for cosmology : the existence of such large amounts of h@xmath3 on galaxy scales could favor a parameter space of dark matter with partially suppressed hierarchical galaxy formation on sub - galactic scales , as a consequence of the enhanced free streaming lengths found in scenarios such as warm dark matter ( e.g. coln , avila - reese & valenzuela 2000 ; bode , ostriker & turok 2000 ) .",
    "we remark that the large range in star formation efficiencies should be incorporated into models of galaxy formation .",
    "semi - analytical simulations of galaxy formation which assume a constant star formation efficiency as a function of circular velocity ( lacey & silk 1991 ; white & frenk 1991 ; cole et al .",
    "2000 ; kauffmann et al . 1999 ; somerville & primack 1999 ) are far too simplistic to give meaningful predictions of , for example , the cosmic star formation history .",
    "we used our model to infer the redshift evolution of star formation and of the tully - fisher relation .",
    "star formation rate predictions are compatible with the data , although the scatter , uncertainties and various biases makes this a rather uncertain endeavor .",
    "sfrs are expected to undergo stronger evolution in systems with high rotational velocities , whereas low - mass systems feature a steadier formation rate due to their low efficiencies .",
    "the range of specific formation rates with stellar mass is predicted to decrease with redshift .",
    "the tully - fisher relation is expected to evolve _ in slope _ , as well as in zero point , because the age distribution of the stellar population varies with galaxy mass , being more spread out in low - mass disks .",
    "hence , we expect a steepening of the slope . for instance , in rest frame @xmath54 band the slope changes from @xmath107 at zero redshift ( @xmath5 ) up to @xmath108 at @xmath10 ( figure  10 ) , with a slight dependence on the formation redshift , giving stronger evolution for low formation redshifts .",
    "the zero point should thus be given with respect to some fiducial rotational velocity .",
    "we show the evolution of the zero point at low ( @xmath109 ) and high mass ( @xmath72 ) is in agreement with the latest observations from vogt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for high mass systems , as well as with bershady et al .",
    "( 1998 ) both for high and low masses . notwithstanding the many observational difficulties that complicate accurate estimates of the redshift evolution of @xmath78",
    ", we find the evolution of the slope of the tully - fisher relation to be the best observable for exploring the star formation process in disk galaxies , in analogy with the study of the slope of the fundamental plane in early - type systems ( ferreras & silk 2000b ) .",
