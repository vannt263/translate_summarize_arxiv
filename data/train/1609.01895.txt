    "<S> the spin liquid ground state of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 has remained a long standing problem . by synchrotron </S>",
    "<S> based terahertz measurements , we provide evidence of strong coupling between the magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom that begins to develop at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this is revealed by hybrid crystal electric field - phonon excitations which appear at 0.67thz below 200k , and around 0.42thz below 50k . </S>",
    "<S> this double vibronic process only occurs for tb@xmath2 in the titinate family due to adequate energy matching and strong quadrupolar moments . </S>",
    "<S> lattice motion is then the driving force behind spin flips , promoting quantum terms in the effective hamiltonian that describes tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .    .    </S>",
    "<S> over the last decade , spin - ice physics has aroused significant attention @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it emerges in pyrochlore magnets , like ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 or dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , as a result of effective ferromagnetic interactions coupling the ising - like rare earth magnetic moments constrained along the local @xmath3 directions by the crystal field @xcite(fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : absspec ] ( a , b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this combination impedes long range order , favoring a disordered and macroscopically degenerate magnetic state governed by an organizing principle , the so - called  ice rule \" , where two spins point into and two out of each elementary tetrahedron in the structure @xcite .    the possibility that quantum fluctuations can melt </S>",
    "<S> the spin ice state is a topical issue . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected to lead to a wealth of exotic phenomena such as a quantum superposition of `` two - in two - out '' configurations and emergent electrodynamics with new deconfined particles @xcite .    in this context , the puzzling behavior of the spin liquid tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  has attracted much attention . despite effective antiferromagnetic interactions , </S>",
    "<S> tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  features no long range order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the ground state supports elastic power law spin correlations @xcite , bearing some resemblance with the pinch point pattern observed in spin ices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below 300mk , a dispersing low - energy collective mode is found to emerge from these pinch points , reaching its maximum energy at @xmath40.25mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this signal likely corresponds to fluctuations between the two @xmath5 electronic states of the crystal electric field ( cef ) ground state doublet . </S>",
    "<S> it was interpreted as a signature of interactions between quadrupoles , highlighting the importance of those degrees of freedom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the non - kramers nature of tb@xmath2 ions prevents magnetic exchange alone from inducing such fluctuations within the ising - like ground state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a property that distinguishes tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1from the other rare - earth titanates is the cef energy spectrum of tb@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it features a first excited doublet at a low energy of @xmath6mev above the ground state @xcite , compared to 25mev for ho@xmath2 in the prototype spin ice compound . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , below @xmath420k , this excited doublet has been shown to couple to a transverse acoustic phonon , forming a hybrid magneto - elastic excitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed that a magneto - elastic coupling , linear in the phonon displacement and in the quadrupolar electronic moments , could explain the peculiar ground state of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . to confirm this hypothesis , it is important to show that this magneto - elastic coupling not only occurs for the excited cef doublet , but also with the ground doublet .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we provide evidence for such a coupling using terahertz ( thz ) spectroscopy , which probes the brillouin zone center in the energy range close to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our synchrotron based experiments , performed with an unprecedented accuracy , show a splitting of both the ground and first excited doublets that occurs by coupling with the acoustic phonon at temperatures as high as 50k . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the actual ground state of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  has a mixed magnetic and phononic nature . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that this low temperature vibronic process is not alone . </S>",
    "<S> a second process is observed as high as 200k and couples the first excited cef state and associated transition at @xmath7 with a silent optical phonon mode .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were performed using a tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystal grown by the floating zone technique previously described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the polarization dependent thz spectrum in the 0.21.0thz ( 0.824.14mev ) energy range using both standard ( ssr)@xcite and coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr)@xcite techniques . </S>",
    "<S> focus is given to the `` high temperature '' regime , from 300k to 6k . </S>",
    "<S> four plaquettes , 2 mm in diameter , were chosen to test the magnetoelectric activity of the excited modes according to the main cubic symmetry axes . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the ( 100 ) wafer ( 1 mm thick ) is perpendicular to the four - fold axis while the ( 111 ) wafer ( 300@xmath8 m thick ) is perpendicular to the three - fold axis . to probe the local rare earth symmetry with an ising direction along </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 $ ] , two additional wafers ( 1@xmath100 ) , and ( 11@xmath11 ) ( 300@xmath8 m thick ) are used allowing three mutually orthogonal planes : ( 111 ) , ( 1@xmath100 ) , and ( 11@xmath11 ) . note then , that the projection of the polarized thz field in the local frame is mixed between the 4 tb@xmath2 sites of each tetrahedron ( see supplemental material @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> typical spectra are given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : absspec](c ) with a 200k reference . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature is lowered down to 6k , an absorption peak develops around 0.42thz ( 1.7mev ) . this feature is consistent with the first excited cef level previously reported by neutron and optical spectroscopic studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a much weaker and so far unreported peak is visible at 0.67thz ( 2.78mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> previous experimental studies suggest that the low - temperature magnetic correlations first begin to develop below  50k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore analyze this temperature regime using the spectrum at 60k ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : absspec](d ) ) as a reference . noticeably , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : absspec](d ) the peak at 0.67thz ( 2.78mev ) is not present indicating that its strength and energy position do not change significantly over this temperature range and its contribution is divided out along with the background . at the same time , close inspection reveals a three peak structure within the cef excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the four observed peaks , with 200k and 60k references , are fit by gaussian profiles shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : absspec](d ) designated p0 , p1 , p2 and p3 . </S>",
    "<S> their energy position and normalized total area are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tmpdpnd ] . </S>",
    "<S> no significant temperature shifts are observed for their energy position except for a slight hardening below 20k for p3 and above 100k for p1 . </S>",
    "<S> the precise fitted peak energies at 6k are e0=0.332(4)thz ( 1.37(2)mev ) , e1=0.41(6)thz ( 1.71(2)mev ) , e2=0.502(9)thz ( 2.08(3)mev ) , and e3=0.672(6)thz ( 2.78(3)mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> p0 , p1 and p2 mainly appear below 50k , while p3 appears at the much higher temperature of 200k , indicating a different origin .    </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to assign the three peak structure ( p0-p2 ) to a splitting of the ground and first excited cef levels , that share the @xmath12 symmetry </S>",
    "<S> . the resulting four level scheme will give rise to the 3 observed excitations if the central peak ( p1 ) corresponds to two different transitions of the same energy ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hyb ] ( a ) ) within our experimental precision . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 splitting is then similar for both the ground state doublet and the first excited doublet at a value of 0.085thz ( 0.35mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a splitting corresponds very nicely in energy with the collective mode measured by neutron scattering at a much lower temperature ( 50mk ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that it is experimentally impossible to assign the entire four peak spectrum to transitions between the two doublets with different splittings @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature profile for the outer peaks ( p0 and p2 ) is modeled by a two - level system with an energy barrier of 0.42thz ( @xmath13 1.7mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> it bears similarity to the temperature dependence of the magneto - elastic mode ( mem ) measured by fennell _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ using inelastic neutron scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mem has been shown to arise from hybridization between the @xmath14 acoustic phonon and first excited cef level taking on a magneto - elastic component . </S>",
    "<S> a zone center extrapolation of the scattering vector dependent neutron data is in good agreement with the energy of p2 at 0.50thz ( 2.08mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the acoustic phonon branch must also cross the cef ground state at the zone center , hybridization with the ground state is also expected due to its identical @xmath12 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly what we observe , with similar splitting for both the ground and first excited states . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the collective mode built on the basis of the @xmath5 states in the ground doublet already incorporates lattice degrees of freedom as does the first excited cef state . </S>",
    "<S> similar vibronic phonon - cef interactions have also been shown for ceal@xmath0 and facilitate mixing between the ground and first excited cef states @xcite .    in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the hybridization process between the two @xmath12 cef levels and the @xmath14 acoustic phonon depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hyb ] ( b ) is not alone . a recent report by ruminy _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggests that other hybridized magneto - elastic optical ( meom ) excitations occur at much higher energies around 3.9thz ( 16mev ) due to the proximity of optical phonons . </S>",
    "<S> their work is corroborated by a complementary study focused on the phonon spectrum in these compounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> noticeably , their ab inito calculations show that the lowest energy phonon is at @xmath41.1thz ( 4.6mev ) and has @xmath15 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this phonon is optically silent ( both in raman and infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy ) , and it is not observed by inelastic neutron scattering because of a negligible scattering cross section . since it is quite close in energy to the additional p3 excitation that occurs below 200k at 0.67thz ( 2.78mev ) , we assign p3 to a coupling mechanism between this @xmath15 phonon and the first excited cef level . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that this optical phonon branch does not cross the @xmath12 ground state , and therefore is not coupled to it .    </S>",
    "<S> using infrared reflection measurements , we have checked that the 7 expected ir active phonon modes are present in the range 80800 @xmath16(2.424thz ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed phonon energies reveal a discrepancy in comparison to the calculated values which suggests that the lowest energy @xmath15 phonon may indeed be even closer to the first excited @xmath12 cef level .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , two different vibronic processes must occur in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1at two different temperature scales . </S>",
    "<S> a diagram of the two coupling mechanisms and corresponding level scheme is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hyb ] . </S>",
    "<S> the high temperature vibronic process involves the first excited @xmath12 cef and the lowest energy @xmath15 optical phonon . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting hybridization develops below 200k as seen with the appearance of peak p3 at an intermediate energy between the @xmath12 cef level and the @xmath15 phonon energy . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling mechanism transfers magnetic thz activity to an otherwise silent phonon . </S>",
    "<S> the low temperature vibronic process occurs when magnetic fluctuations set in below 50k . </S>",
    "<S> it involves the ground and first excited cef levels , which both have @xmath12 symmetry , and the @xmath14 acoustic phonon . </S>",
    "<S> it results in the splitting of both the ground and first excited doublets which acquire a mixed electronic - phononic character .    </S>",
    "<S> additional valuable information about these cef - phonon processes is obtained by the selection rules observed for each excitation and their angular dependence when the polarization of the thz electric ( @xmath17 ) and magnetic ( @xmath18 ) fields is rotated . </S>",
    "<S> we first confirm that the hybridized features ( p2 and p3 ) are mainly of magnetic origin . </S>",
    "<S> when measuring two configurations with the same direction for @xmath18 but 90 degrees rotation for @xmath17 , the same features are present @xcite . using a rotative sample mount , we were then able to precisely measure the angular dependence of the spectrum for a rotation about the [ 100 ] fourfold and @xmath19 $ ] two fold axes of the cubic structure ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : angldpnd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the [ 100 ] axis has no particular meaning in the rare earth site symmetry while the @xmath19 $ ] direction corresponds to a two fold axis for two sites out of four on each tetrahedron @xcite . around </S>",
    "<S> [ 100 ] , the spectrum remains unchanged as expected . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , around @xmath19 $ ] , a strong anisotropy appears for all peaks except p1 . </S>",
    "<S> p2 has a maximum intensity for @xmath20 $ ] , while both p0 and p3 behave inversely with maximum intensities when @xmath21 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a transfer of spectral weight between p2 and p3 showing that the two vibronic processes are not independent .    </S>",
    "<S> this double vibronic mechanism accounts for a mixing between electronic states and propagating phonon modes , which occur in crystals when the excitations are of the same symmetry and are close enough in energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse components of the acoustic t@xmath22 phonon fulfill the symmetry requirements for both the ground and first excited cef states and their coupling may induce a splitting of these doublet levels . as for the silent optical t@xmath23 phonon </S>",
    "<S> , its longitudinal component is also allowed to couple to the cef states inducing no splitting but a shift in the cef level . </S>",
    "<S> this optical phonon is close in energy to the first excited cef doublet and will dominantly form vibrons with it at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> its dispersion can be reasonably assumed flatter than that of the acoustic phonon leading to a larger density of states . at lower temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> this vibronic process should weaken owing to thermal depopulation leaving the vibronic process with the acoustic phonon to gradually take hold . while p3 is still preset at 6k </S>",
    "<S> , this process appears evident in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tmpdpnd ] ( c ) with a slight reduction in the intensity of p3 at the lowest temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the double vibronic process involves quadrupolar operators which behave as spin flip operators in the @xmath24 ground state doublet basis . as a result , phonons ( and lattice zero point motion ) </S>",
    "<S> are now the source of spin fluctuations and by their virtual exchange may give rise to new quantum terms in the effective hamiltonian of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . depending on their strength , a long range quadrupolar order or coulomb - phase  like state might be stabilized , provided the ising term dominates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , an interesting feature of the vibronic process is that the acoustic phonon crosses the two doublets , which being themselves close in energy , will also partially mix . </S>",
    "<S> we anticipate that the magnetic dipolar operators will then behave as spin flip operators in the basis of the dressed @xmath5 electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism , already proposed in ref @xcite , could be the source of additional fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> . this will not be the case for ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 : although the symmetry of both phonons and cef states are identical , the energy of the first cef state is one order of magnitude larger reducing the vibronic process solely to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the quadrupolar matrix elements in the basis of the ground @xmath5 electronic states are essentially zero for ho@xmath2 and dy@xmath2 .    in summary , using synchrotron based thz spectroscopy , we show that two temperature regimes are present in the spin ice candidate tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  revealing two different vibronic processes . the first one , below 50k , concerns the ground and first excited cef levels which couple to the acoustic @xmath14 phonon . </S>",
    "<S> this is the temperature scale of magnetic fluctuations @xcite as well as elastic softening @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second regime , below 200k , is associated to the coupling between the first cef level and the lowest energy optical phonon of symmetry @xmath15 and is in agreement with the high temperature plateau observed in the muon spin relaxation rate @xcite for this compound . </S>",
    "<S> this double vibronic process , of quadrupolar origin , affects the electronic state that can no longer be described solely by electronic wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> rather a collective vibronic state prevails , built on the ground and first excited cef states mixed with two different phonons . </S>",
    "<S> it is activated with dramatic effects in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  by virtue of adequate energy matching and strong quadrupolar moments that only occur in this compound . </S>"
