    "2    phase transitions are well known to be influenced by geometrical confinement @xcite . in practice , confinement is often imposed by rigid external constraints , for example the surfaces of porous or artificially nanostructured media .",
    "however , it can also be an inherent feature of a system , as occurs for a liquid wetting film bound to a solid substrate and in equilibrium with its vapour @xcite .",
    "in such a situation the liquid is confined between the rigid substrate and the flexible liquid - vapour interface .",
    "the effects of confinement are particularly pronounced in the region of critical points . under such conditions",
    "the system exhibits strong order parameter fluctuations , the correlation length of which may become comparable with the linear dimension of the confined system .",
    "when this occurs the effects of confinement are felt not just near the confining surfaces , but propagate throughout the system @xcite .",
    "critical fluctuation are relevant to the properties of liquid wetting films if the liquid in question possesses an additional internal degree of freedom .",
    "then the state of the liquid is described not only by its number density , but by an additional parameter measuring the degree of internal order .",
    "examples are binary liquids , where the additional order parameter is the relative concentration of species , and ferrofluids where it is the magnetisation . in such systems the geometrical constraint ( i.e. the film thickness ) can itself depend on the state of order in the liquid film .",
    "for example , simulation and experiment have recently shown that critical concentration fluctuations can change the equilibrium thickness of a wetting layer of a binary liquid  the so - called critical casimir effect @xcite .",
    "it transpires , however , that the interesting consequences of interplay between the degree of order in the wetting layer and film thickness are not limited to the critical point itself . to illustrate this , it is instructive to consider the following _ gedanken _ experiment",
    ". let us take a symmetrical binary fluid , i.e. a fluid in which particles of the same species have one strength of interaction , while interactions between dissimilar species have another strength . as elucidated in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to arrange for such a system to exhibit a line of continuous demixing transitions , terminating in a critical end point on the liquid side of liquid - vapour coexistence .",
    "suppose now that the fluid is placed in contact with a non - selective attractive substrate ( wall ) acting equally on both species .",
    "if the wall is sufficiently attractive , complete wetting occurs at and above the critical end point temperature @xmath0 as liquid - vapour coexistence is approached from the vapour side .",
    "but what happens for @xmath1 ?",
    "far from coexistence , the wetting film is sufficiently thin that demixing will certainly be suppressed .",
    "on approaching the coexistence curve , however , the film    thickness grows and it is tempting to argue that it eventually exceeds the correlation length of composition fluctuations , whereupon the film spontaneously demixes .    notwithstanding the appealing simplicity of this argument , it turns out to contain two flaws which render the actual situation rather more complex .",
    "first , the thickness of the _ mixed _ wetting film will not increase beyond all limits below the critical end point @xmath0 .",
    "this is because a hypothetical mixed bulk liquid would not coexist with the vapour phase at the same chemical potential @xmath2 as a demixed liquid , but rather at a chemical potential which is shifted by    @xmath3    towards the liquid side in the @xmath4 plane@xcite . since the thickness of the mixed film grows as @xmath5@xcite , it is bounded from above by    @xmath6    the maximum thickness @xmath7 of a hypothetical mixed film thus diverges logarithmically on approaching @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the correlation length @xmath8 diverges much faster , like @xmath9 and will thus always exceed @xmath7 sufficiently close to @xmath0 .",
    "the second flaw in our argument is its implicit assumption that the composition or order parameter profile is confined in an effectively steplike density profile , i.e. that the interfacial width between the liquid and the vapour is much smaller than the correlation length of composition fluctuations .",
    "although this is true in the region of the critical end point , for temperature sufficiently below @xmath0 the correlation lengths of density and composition fluctuations can be comparable and the interplay between the two subtle .    in the present study",
    ", we deploy mean field calculation and monte carlo simulation to elucidate the range of possible wetting behaviour of a symmetrical binary fluid mixture at a non - selective attractive wall for temperatures below @xmath0 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we have chosen to ignore long range dispersion forces in the analytical calculations , instead taking the interactions to be short ranged .",
    "this allows us to base our study on a generic ginzburg - landau model which we solve numerically and analytically within a square gradient approximation .",
    "the latter leads to the construction of a film free energy ( effective interface potential ) highlighting the role of the different length scales involved in the problem .",
    "we show that the competition of length scales results in wetting phase behavior considerably more complex than has hitherto been appreciated .",
    "the analytical results are compared with ( and supported by ) detailed monte carlo simulations of a binary lennard - jones fluid in a semi - infinite geometry , interacting with a non - selective attractive substrate via dispersion forces .    with regard to previous related work ,",
    "the sole discussion of wetting of symmetrical binary fluids at a non - selective wall ( of which we are aware ) is that of dietrich and schick @xcite who considered them in a sharp kink approximation treatment of binary fluids having long - ranged interactions .",
    "most other work on the wetting properties of binary fluids has focused on the case of a selective substrate ( favouring one component ) @xcite .",
    "although such models correspond more closely than ours to experimental conditions @xcite , they lack the aspect of simultaneous demixing / ordering and wetting which is of interest to us here .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that realisations of fluids having symmetrical internal degrees of freedom do in fact exist , notably in the form of ferrofluids @xcite , so our model is of more than purely theoretical interest .",
    "more general studies of wetting in systems with more than one order parameter and associated length scales have been discussed by hauge @xcite , who pointed out that wetting exponents may become nonuniversal even on the mean field level due to the competition of length scales .",
    "later studies have often focused on this nonuniversality , e.g. in the context of wetting phenomena in superconductors @xcite , alloys @xcite and related systems @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : landau ] we introduce our ginzburg - landau free energy functional and obtain its wetting behaviour in the limits of infinite and vanishing order parameter stiffness . at intermediate values of the stiffness",
    "parameter the wetting behaviour is found firstly via an analytical minimisation of the functional within a piecewise parabolic potential approximation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : anal ] ) , and then ( in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] ) via a numerical minimisation of the free energy functional to obtain the density / order parameter profiles . in section  [ sec : mc ] we report the results of grand canonical monte carlo studies of a symmetrical binary lennard - jones fluid at an attractive structureless wall .",
    "the density and order parameter profiles with respect to the wall are obtained along a sub - critical isotherm for a number of different wall - fluid potential strengths .",
    "finally we compare and discuss the mean - field and simulation results in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "our theoretical studies are based on a generic ginzburg - landau functional for a system with two order parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath12 with the bulk free energy density @xmath13 and the bare surface free energy at the wall @xmath14 the @xmath15-axis is taken to be perpendicular to the wall and @xmath16 integrates over the remaining spatial dimensions . in our case , the quantity @xmath17 is related to the difference between the partial densities of the two components , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 to the total density , @xmath20 , where the reference density @xmath21 is chosen in the liquid / vapour coexistence region such the cubic term proportional to @xmath22 in ( [ eqn : fb0 ] ) vanishes . below the liquid / vapour critical point , it is convenient to set the units of @xmath19 , @xmath17 , @xmath23 and of the length such that @xmath24 , and to define @xmath25 .",

    "[ fig : ew1.7 ] ] , results in considerably more structure near the wall compared to @xmath247 , with clear density oscillations arising from excluded - volume ` packing effects ' @xcite .",
    "the profile is much more responsive to changes in the chemical potential and reaches a thickness of 4 - 5 molecular diameters close to coexistence .    for @xmath250 , however , the situation changes qualitatively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew1.75 ] . on increasing the chemical potential ,",
    "a clear jump is observed in both the thickness of the film , and the value of its density . in the thick film ,",
    "the density of a significant portion of the film is that of    ( 65,55 ) ( 10,0 )    ( 65,55 ) ( 10,0 )    ( 65,55 ) ( 10,0 )    ( 65,55 ) ( 10,0 )    the bulk liquid .",
    "this thin - thick jump constitutes a prewetting transition , as previously observed in simulation studies of lattice gas models @xcite , lennard - jones fluids @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .    as the wall potential",
    "is increased to @xmath251 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew2 ] ) , the sharp prewetting transition is lost and instead the film thickness increases smoothly as @xmath29 approaches its coexistence value .",
    "this suggests that here the system is above the prewetting critical point ( @xcite ) .    on increasing @xmath221 to @xmath252 ,",
    "a new feature emerges ( fig .",

    ", the thickness of the film initially increases smoothly with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "however , once the thickness reaches some @xmath244 molecular diameters , a large jump occurs to a thickness of about @xmath253 molecular diameters .",
    "concomitant with this jump is a demixing of the film as a whole , as seen in the order parameter profile fig .",
    "[ fig : ew3](b ) .",
    "the size of the jump in the layer thickness appears to reduce as the wall strength is increased to @xmath254 ( fig .",

    "( 65,50 ) ( 10,0 )",
    "the monte carlo simulation results at subcritical temperatures provide evidence that the mean field calculations correctly identify the qualitative wetting behaviour .",
    "they show that depending on the fluid - wall interaction strength @xmath221 , a number of different wetting scenarios occur as liquid - vapour coexistence is approached from the vapour side . at small @xmath221 ,",
    "only a very thin film builds up on the wall . for intermediate values of @xmath221 , a first prewetting transition",
    "is observed from a thin mixed film to a thick liquidlike mixed layer .",
    "further increasing @xmath221 induces a second prewetting transition between a mixed liquidlike layer and a thicker demixed film , the situation being very similar to that shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "the abrupt , first order , character of this latter transition appears to weaken on further increasing @xmath221 , in accord with the theoretical predictions .",
    "we will now attempt to set our results within the context of the bulk phase diagram of the binary liquid . to this end",
    ", we discuss the possible wetting scenarios in the vicinity of the critical end point @xmath0 .",
    "as previously argued in the introduction , for temperatures @xmath255 sufficiently close to @xmath0 , the bulk correlation length @xmath8 of the demixed liquid is larger than the thickness @xmath7 of a mixed liquid layer at the wall .",
    "the state of order of the film thus depends strongly on the boundary conditions of the two interfaces confining the liquid layer .",
    "the nonselective liquid - vapor interface always favors mixing due to the reduced number of interacting neighbors in the interfacial region .",
    "the liquid - substrate interface , on the other hand , can either favour mixing or demixing depending on the strength of the fluid - wall potential . for a weakly attractive wall potential ,",
    "mixing is favoured because the particle density at the wall is low and the presence of the wall reduces the number of interacting neighbours . for a strongly attractive wall , however",
    ", the high density at the wall can counteract the missing neighbour effect leading to an overall demixing tendency .",
    "if the net effect favours mixing at the wall , a continuous demixing of the layer as coexistence is approached can be excluded .",
    "a first order transition involving a discontinuous increase of the film thickness upon demixing is still conceivable .",
    "however , we have shown in section [ sec : limit ] , that ( at the mean field level , at least ) the demixed wetting film has a higher free energy than the corresponding mixed film provided the correlation length of composition fluctuations is sufficiently large .    at walls which suppress demixing ,",
    "the film is thus always mixed close to the critical end point , and its thickness @xmath7 below the critical end point is finite .",
    "hence the critical end point is automatically a critical wetting point .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : wetschem ] ( a ) .",
    "note that the wetting transition here is pinned by a bulk phase transition , a situation somewhat reminiscent of triple - point wetting @xcite .",
    "the situation changes if the substrate favours demixing .",
    "in this situation , one component segregates to the surface of the film already slightly above @xmath0 , and the order propagates continuously into the bulk of the film at @xmath0 .",
    "the film remains wet at @xmath0 . from the results of section [ sec : num ] ( in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig : phwet3 ] ) , one can deduce two possible scenarios . the film may still exhibit a first order wetting transition to a nonwet state at a temperature below @xmath0 ( e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig : phwet3 ] ) at @xmath256 ) .",
    "the discontinuous phase transition at liquid / vapour coexistence then spawns a prewetting line which eventually switches into a second order demixing line and loops around the critical end point as suggested in fig .",
    "[ fig : wetschem ] ( b ) .",
    "if the wall is strongly attractive ( e.g. at @xmath257 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : phwet3 ] ) , the wall wets at all temperatures , the prewetting line detaches from the coexistence line and is continued by second order demixing lines both at the high and low temperature side as sketched in fig .",
