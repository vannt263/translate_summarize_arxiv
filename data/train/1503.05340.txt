    "it is well known that the virtual pair production and destruction occur always when the external field acts to the vacuum .",
    "further these virtual pair produced particles gain the energy from the external field and then these particles appear as real particles . in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) or similar , in particular the case of electron - positron in the presence of the external electric field this is known as the schwinger effect  @xcite and has been well analyzed theoretically .",
    "so far the analysis have been done by calculating the vacuum energy density @xmath4 and then the imaginary part @xmath5 is considered as the particle - antiparticle pair production rate defined as @xmath6 it is physically interpreted that the pair production is due to the tunnel effect , because the energy has the imaginary part .",
    "a direct physical clarification of the pair production in the background field was made by two of us of the present authors ( h.b.n . and m.n .",
    ")  @xcite . when the electric field is applied to the negative energy electrons in the dirac sea , the right - mover particles and left - mover holes gain the energy and are pumped up or down , the pair production occurs .",
    "this mechanism is depicted in figure  [ pic : pair.prod-0 ] where the blue circle denotes the electron and the white circle is the positron .",
    "the purpose of the present article is twofold .",
    "the first purpose is to reveal in a quantum field theoretical method the dynamics of the pair production .",
    "we show in more detail and precisely that the pair production state is a superposition of all possible particle and antiparticle state .",
    "in fact we will show that the pair production state is indeed a superposition of one pair , two pairs , three pairs , ... of particle and antiparticle with various energies .",
    "the second theme of the present paper is a kind of new physical derivation of the weyl anomaly . in 1974 , d. m. capper and m. j. duff discovered the weyl anomaly  @xcite that the trace of the energy - momentum tensor for a massless weyl fermion in a gravitational background is not as classically expected to be @xmath7 , but rather @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor and @xmath0 is the ricci scalar",
    ". later many recalculations of this anomaly has been made ( see the review , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the present article is an attempt to obtain a physical understanding of how this anomaly comes about , i.e. to reveal the mechanism that the pair production from the dirac sea leads the weyl anomaly . as such it is also inspired by the interpretation of the chiral anomaly as pumping up or down states from or to the dirac sea @xcite of two of us ( m.n and h.b.n ) .",
    "an another attempt to understand the @xmath10 dimensional weyl anomaly by our thinking on the dirac sea we presented in @xcite .    as setting up",
    "we consider @xmath10 dimensional euclidean cylinder type space - time with the conformal flat metric @xmath11 . in this space - time",
    "we investigate the vacuum - to - vacuum transition amplitude of the massless dirac fermion which has weyl symmetric action .",
    "we then make a basis transformation of ( or , in other words , pull back ) the amplitude into the fock space in the space - time with another metric @xmath12",
    ". then we can show that the dirac sea in the space - time specified by the primed metric @xmath13 ranging from @xmath14-past to @xmath15-future is expressed on the basis in the space - time with @xmath16 as a pair produced state on each time - slice . by summing up these pair production contribution from @xmath14-past to @xmath15-future",
    ", the difference between the vacuum ( or casimir ) energy in the space - time of the metric @xmath13 and that of the metric @xmath16 gives rise to the ricci scalar . in this way we finally obtain the weyl anomaly .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the following section [ sec1 ] we summarize the construction of the weyl particles and dirac sea in the gravitational background . in the section [ sec2 ]",
    "we then formulate the state description of the pair production and evaluate the weyl anomaly using the dirac sea formalism . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we conclude and give an outlook as to how possibly to extend the use of our formalism .",
    "we have in addition three appendices .",

    ", we formulated the boson sea which is the vacuum being filled with negative energy bosons .",
    "if we set the background metric to the conformally flat one and transform the boson sea by the weyl transformation , we can construct the pair produced state from the boson sea vacuum , which would be the bosonic version of ( [ eq:2-weyl.dirac.a ] ) .",
    "all we should do may be parallel to the method shown in the present article .",
    "all other anomalies such as the gravitational anomaly being generated via the pair production from the sea : + we can apply our method to the physical interpretations of all anomalies and unify them in terms of the pair production from the sea vacuum .",
    "3 .   the hawking radiation and the gravitational wave : + when we consider the sea vacuum in the schwarzschild or de sitter space - time background",
    ", we can express the hawking radiation as the pair production state .",
    "in particular , in the case of the complex boson and the boson sea , we can represent the gravitational wave by using the pair production state as the hawking radiation , because the number of the degrees of freedom of the gravitational wave is two which is identical to that of the complex boson .",
    "then we may be able to evaluate the entropies of the black hole and the inflationary universe using the notion of the typicality @xcite or the formulation of statistical mechanics based on the thermal pure quantum states @xcite .",
