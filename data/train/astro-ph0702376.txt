    "one of the exciting developments in radio galaxy research in recent years has been the recognition of a restarting of nuclear activity following a quiescent period .",
    "the usual extended twin - lobe radio morphology of radio galaxies are in some cases found to be accompanied by a second pair of lobes sharing the same central radio core ( roettiger et al .",
    "1994 ; subrahmanyan , saripalli & hunstead 1986 ; schoenmakers et al .",
    "the ` double - double ' structures were interpreted by these authors as radio galaxies that were experiencing a second epoch of activity .",
    "detailed studies of some of the more striking examples of this class of radio galaxies ( e.g. lara et al .",
    "1999 ; schoenmakers et al .",
    "2000b ; saripalli , subrahmanyan & udayashankar 2002 ; saripalli , subrahmanyan & udayashankar 2003 ) have estimated the ages of the second activity epoch to be few times @xmath2 yr suggesting that the restarted activity is fairly recent in comparison with the ages of radio galaxies in general ( scheuer 1995 ; mack et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the nuclear activity that manifests itself as extended twin lobe radio structures in radio galaxies is believed to be the result of gas being accreted on to a super - massive black hole located at the centre .",
    "there is evidence that gas at the centres of active galaxies forms an accretion disk via which it gets transported to the vicinity of the schwarzschild radius of a few thousandths of a parsec .",
    "an important component of the central region of an active galaxy is a torus of dust and gas situated at much larger scales from several hundred parsec to a few kiloparsec .",
    "observations have targeted this region for clues to the presence of a fuel reservoir powering the active galaxies ( e.g. mazzarella et al . 1993 ; lim et al .",
    "the fuel searched for at millimetre wavelengths is the co gas since next to molecular hydrogen , that has only weak emission lines , the co molecules are the most abundant .",
    "the causes behind the restarting of nuclear activity are far from clear .",
    "suggestions have been speculative and have included ` long term variability ' in central engine output ( roettiger et al .",
    "1994 ) and accretion disk instabilities ( e.g. schoenmakers et al .",
    "2000a ) . in this paper",
    "we explore this question of why radio galaxies become inactive and then restart their nuclear activity after several million years .",
    "we look at the causes from the point of view of fuel availability to the central engine . starting from the basic premise that all agn require fuel for their activity we enquire whether the inactivity is caused by an interruption to the fuelling process or a depletion of the fuel store that sustained the activity .",
    "are the manifestations we see ( of nested , inner double lobe structures ) a result of a new accumulation of fuel after its depletion in the earlier epoch or a continuation of the old fuelling process after an interruption ?",

    "we have presented results of a search program for molecular gas in a sample of powerful radio galaxies that are thought to be undergoing a second epoch of nuclear activity .",
    "the search was carried out using the iram 30-m telescope on pico veleta in the co j(10 ) and j(21 ) line transitions of the co molecule , a known effective tracer of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the motivation for the search for molecular gas in these radio galaxies was to throw light on the possible causes of the restarting of nuclear activity after a period of quiescence .",
    "one possible scenario is depletion of a previous tranche of fuel followed by recent accumulation of fuel after a period of time and another possibility is the continuation of the original fuelling process after an interruption .",
    "we expect that the former possibility , where a recent fuel accumulation has restarted the nuclear activity in these sources would increase their detectability in co.    we discuss the co detection rate for a representative sample of nine restarting radio galaxies , seven of which were observed for the first time .",
    "we report relatively sensitive upper limits that suggest there is no indication of molecular gas mass larger than few @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "abundant molecular gas content therefore does not necessarily seem to accompany the nuclear restarting phenomenon .",
    "the restarting radio galaxies are found to be as deficient in molecular gas as the edge brightened fr - ii radio galaxies suggesting that there has been no recent accumulation of molecular gas .",
    "the interruption to the jet production in these sources may have been a result of instabilities in the earlier fuel flow rather than due to a depletion of fuel . for comparison",
    ", we also discuss the molecular gas properties of five normal giant radio galaxies , three of which were observed by us using sest .",
    "these sources are thought to form the parent sample of restarting sources .",
    "all five have only upper limits suggesting a lack of large ( @xmath5 ) molecular gas content in these largest and among the oldest of radio galaxies .",
