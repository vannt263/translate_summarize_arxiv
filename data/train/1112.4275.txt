    "the nature and the optimal dynamical control of the correlations present in a given interacting quantum system are of interest to fundamental aspects of quantum physics but also to the physical implementation of quantum computation and algorithms @xcite .",
    "a decade ago , two separate works reported from los alamos @xcite and oxford @xcite set a formal framework that allowed the identification of quantum correlations different to entanglement .",
    "such correlations ubiquituosly manifest themselves in interacting quantum systems , even in the absence of entanglement , and it has been demonstrated that they can play a key role in quantum computing protocols such as dqc1 @xcite , without the need to invoke quantum entanglement . it has become clear that zero entanglement does not imply classicality , and the task of classifying the kind of total correlations present in a given system into quantum and classical parts has led to the introduction of quantifiers ( different to entanglement ) such as the quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite .",
    "this measure of the ` quantumness ' of correlations is defined in terms of the difference between the two possible ways to obtain the mutual information ( mi ) that arises in the quantum case .",
    "more recently , it has been argued that the power of the quantum computer can be attributed to both entanglement and quantum discord which are distributed following a monogamic relation @xcite .",
    "further , other reports on the classification and quantification of quantum and classical correlations have been put forward @xcite . a unified view of quantum , classical and total correlations using the concept of relative entropy as a distance measure of correlations has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "an experimental investigation of classical and quantum correlations has been recently reported for a system of two polarized photons in the presence of a phase - decoherence non - dissipative channel @xcite , and a sudden transition between classical and quantum correlations dynamics has been reported @xcite , a result in line with a recent theoretical proposal @xcite .",
    "we start with a brief definition of correlations ( sec .",
    "[ codef ] ) followed by the formulation of the dissipative dynamics under consideration , in sec .",
    "[ secsystem ] .",
    "our main findings are detailed in sections [ secdissipative]-[seclaser ] as follows : we show that the entanglement of formation , rather than the concurrence , is the free of ambiguity metric that should be used to correctly quantify the entanglement generated in the emitters system ( sec . [ secdissipative ] ) .",
    "the computed concurrence can reach higher values than the mutual information , which is the highest possible value for the total ( classical plus quantum ) correlations . in sec .",
    "[ secorder ] we demonstrate analytically , in the absence of laser pumping , that there exist an entropy bound for which the quantum correlations are _ always _ greater than classical correlations , a fact which disproves an early conjecture posed in @xcite . in section [ seclaser ]",
    "we give numerical examples for which such result also holds when the emitters are optically - controlled by an external laser field .",
    "this also gives a method for stationary enhancement of the degree of correlations by tailoring the laser amplitudes and the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we begin by considering an open bipartite system , say the molecular dimer @xmath0 .",
    "its quantum dynamics can be described in terms of the total density matrix @xmath1 ; the partial information about each of the subsystems is given by the reduced density matrices @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "in classical information theory , the mutual information ( mi ) can be written in terms of the conditional entropy of two random variables , that is , for a system described by two classical random variables , the most information that one can gain from the two variables is the mi .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be two random variables with shannon entropies @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the mi is written as : @xmath8 using bayes s rules for the conditional probability @xmath9 , the mi reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the conditional entropy @xcite .",
    "the mutual information has been demonstrated to describe the whole content of correlations in a given quantum system , and at any time @xmath12 , the total correlations present in such a system can be quantified by the quantum version of eq .",
    "( [ cmi ] ) , the so - called quantum mutual information @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "the problem that arises in the quantum case is that the non trivial version of eq .",
    "is not always identical to @xmath15 .",
    "this is because , quantum mechanically , the conditional entropy implies that the state of a subsystem ( say @xmath16 ) is only known after a set of measures has been carried out on the other subsystem ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "ollivier and zurek @xcite proposed a generalization of eq . assuming a complete unidimensional projective measurement made on subsystem @xmath17 , with projectors @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 .",
    "the generalization of eq . allows another way of writing the quantum mutual information ( which in general does not coincide with that of eq .",
    "): @xmath20 where the conditional entropy @xmath21 , with probability @xmath22 , and the density matrix after the measurements have been performed on subsystem @xmath17 is given by @xmath23 equation gives the amount of information gained about @xmath16 after a measure has been carried out on @xmath17 .",
    "a measure for classical correlations ( ccs ) was introduced in ref .",
    "this quantity is defined as the maximum extractable classical information from a subsystem , say @xmath16 , when a set of positive operator valued measures ( povms ) @xcite has been performed on the other subsystem ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the entropy associated to the density matrix of subsystem @xmath16 after the measure .",
    "briefly , a measure of classical correlations should incorporate the following : i ) @xmath26 if and only if @xmath27 , and ii ) @xmath28 must be non - increasing , and invariant under local unitary operations .",
    "in addition , the set of povms that maximize the classical correlation eq . is a complete unidimensional projective measurement @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath29 defines the basis states for qubit @xmath17 , the projectors can be written as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the optimization is carried out over angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "the so - called quantum discord ( qd ) is defined as the minimum of the difference between the eqs . and .",

    "both qd and cc are antisymmetric by definition , i.e. , they depend on what subsystem the measures are taken on @xcite . without loss of generality , we take qubit @xmath17 to be the measured one .      entanglement is a special and a very particular kind of correlation @xcite , radically different to the quantum discord .",
