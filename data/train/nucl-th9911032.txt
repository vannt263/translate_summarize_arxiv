    "<S> we propose a simple method to reproduce the @xmath0 pairing properties of nuclear matter , which are obtained using a sophisticated model , by introducing a density - independent cutoff into the relativistic mean field model . </S>",
    "<S> this can be applied successfully to the physically relevant density range .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 pairing gap @xmath1 in infinite nuclear matter is obtained by solving the gap equation , @xmath2 with @xmath3 indicating the antisymmetrized matrix elements of the particle - particle interaction @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from this equation that the physical ingredients are the single - particle energies @xmath5 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in sophisticated microscopic approaches , the @xmath5 are obtained from brueckner - hartree - fock calculations with bare @xmath6-@xmath6 interactions , which are fitted to the phase shifts of the @xmath6-@xmath6 scatterings in free space . as for @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , most calculations employ bare interactions , while some others employ medium - renormalized interactions , such as the . </S>",
    "<S> approaches involving calculations of the former type are based on the view that the gap equation itself possesses a mechanism to evade strong short - range repulsions , and , accordingly , use of medium - renormalized interactions results in a double counting  @xcite . the forty - year history of non - relativistic studies of the pairing problem  @xcite  has shown that all the bare @xmath6-@xmath6 interactions that are fitted to the phase shifts give almost identical pairing gaps for the @xmath0 channel . </S>",
    "<S> this is because a separable approximation  @xcite  can be made for the channels in which a virtual ( @xmath0 ) or real ( @xmath7 ) bound - state pole exists in the  @xcite , and this leads to an approximate relation between the pairing gap and the phase shift applicable to the low - density region  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> medium renormalizations are understood to cause the gap to become larger because they weaken the short - range repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of whether the medium renormalizations are included , the particle - hole polarizations should be considered in the next order according to a diagrammatic analysis of the gap equation  @xcite , and it is said that they act to reduce the gaps  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another approach to the pairing in nuclear matter is based on the effective interactions that are constructed from the beginning to describe finite - density systems . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the gogny force  @xcite , which describes the bulk and the pairing properties of infinite matter quite well without any cutoffs  @xcite , and another is represented by various versions of the skyrme forces , which require cutoffs for the description of the pairing  @xcite . from the viewpoint of the double counting of the short - range correlation </S>",
    "<S> mentioned above , however , the adequateness of the use of effective forces in the particle - particle ( p - p ) channel is not evident  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this is still an open problem , the gogny force is said to act as a bare force in the p - p channel  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the studies discussed above , the first relativistic study of the pairing in nuclear matter was carried out in 1991  @xcite  by adopting a phenomenological interaction , the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model , which succeeded in reproducing the bulk properties of the finite - density nuclear many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> but the resulting pairing gaps were about three times larger than those accepted as standard in the non - relativistic studies . </S>",
    "<S> after a five - year blank , various attempts to improve this result have begun . </S>",
    "<S> these attempts can be classified into two groups : the first one employs @xmath4 which are consistent with the particle - hole ( p - h ) channel , i.e. the single - particle states  @xcite , and the second one employs @xmath4 which are not explicitly consistent with the p - h channel  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these works which are based on the single - particle states of the rmf model , there exists another  @xcite  which is based on the single - particle states obtained through the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) calculation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this as the third type hereafter . </S>",
    "<S> the result that the calculations of the second and the third types give almost identical pairing gaps indicates that the pairing properties are determined predominantly by the choice of the p - p channel interaction , irrespective of the details of the single - particle states . in addition , the feature that the obtained gaps are very similar to those given by the non - relativistic calculations adopting bare interactions in the p - p channel supports this further . as for the first type , a more elaborate calculation , such as one including the @xmath6-@xmath8 polarizations , </S>",
    "<S> would be necessary  @xcite . as a complement to this kind of study , however , simpler method suitable for realistic applications are also desirable </S>",
    "<S> . examples for which realistic pairing strengths are indispensable are studies of the crust matter in neutron stars and finite open - shell nuclei . in particular , aside from the practical successes of the  </S>",
    "<S> relativistic \" hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations implemented by a non - relativistic force  @xcite , tractable relativistic @xmath4 derived from the lagrangian of the rmf model are needed to keep the concept of the hfb calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to construct a relativistic effective force which can be used also in the p - p channel as the gogny force in the non - relativistic calculation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , first of all , we consider the difference between an effective force and a bare force . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) the one - boson exchange @xmath4 with the coupling constants of the @xmath9-@xmath10 model , which is the simplest version of the rmf model , is shown in comparison with the bonn - b potential  @xcite , which is an example of the relativistic bare @xmath6-@xmath6 interactions . </S>",
    "<S> their shapes differ greatly . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the former is constructed so as to reproduce the saturation property without the short - range correlations , while the latter reproduces it in the dbhf calculation which implies them . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the characteristic feature of the former that both the small - momentum negative _ off - diagonal _ matrix elements and the large - momentum positive ones are stronger than those for the latter . </S>",
    "<S> both of them enhance the pairing gap , as discussed below .    the momentum integration in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) should run to infinity when bare @xmath6-@xmath6 interactions are adopted . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , there is room to introduce a momentum cutoff when we adopt some phenomenological interactions , which are meaningful only for small momenta , as the skyrme force . </S>",
    "<S> evidently the assumption of the rmf model that the nucleon is a point particle can not be justified at sufficiently large momenta . </S>",
    "<S> combining this fact with the strong cutoff dependence in the momentum region 3  8 @xmath11 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) suggests the possibility to choose a proper cutoff which describes the pairing gap quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> note that the necessity of cutting off the large - momentum repulsion in the @xmath4 derived from the rmf model has also been suggested in studies of medium - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is interesting in the respect that two different phenomena , which involve large momentum transfers , suggest similar cutoffs in the rmf - based p - p interaction .    in order to describe superfluidity quantitatively , </S>",
    "<S> not only the pair wave function @xmath12 which determines the gap at the fermi surface @xmath13 but also its derivative , which determines the coherence length  @xcite @xmath14 should be reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> the latter quantity measures the spatial size of the cooper pair . in weakly - coupled systems , </S>",
    "<S> in which @xmath15 is determined by the diagonal matrix element @xmath16 only and @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the interparticle distance ) , @xmath15 and @xmath19 are intimately related to each other . but this does not hold for nuclear many - body systems , and the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath20 play important roles . therefore here we attempt to find a density - independent cutoff @xmath21 for the upper bound of the integrals in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) so as to reproduce , in a wide density range , @xmath15 and @xmath19 obtained by adopting the bonn - b potential . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to introduce an extra parameter into the @xmath9-@xmath10 model to fit the pairing properties described by a sophisticated model without changing the bulk properties .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the numerical calculations is as follows : we start from the @xmath9-@xmath10 model with the no - sea approximation , as we confirmed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the dirac sea effects were negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters used are @xmath22 939 mev , @xmath23 550 mev , @xmath24 783 mev , @xmath25 91.64 , and @xmath26 136.2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were done for symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath27 4 ) and pure neutron matter ( @xmath27 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing gap at each momentum is calculated by the gap equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath21 and the effective mass equation @xmath28 equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) couple to each other through @xmath29 we search for the value of @xmath30 that minimizes @xmath31 here we assume equal weights for @xmath15 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle states are determined by the @xmath9-@xmath10 model in both the  rmf \" and the  bonn \" cases , as in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the summation with respect to @xmath32 is taken as @xmath33  0.2 , 0.3 , @xmath34 , 1.2 @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath35 11 , since we do not anticipate that the present method is applicable to the @xmath36 0 case , as discussed later .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that @xmath37 3.60 @xmath11 minimizes @xmath38 for @xmath27 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this value indicates that not only the small - momentum part , where @xmath39 0 and @xmath40 0 , but also the large - momentum part , where @xmath41 0 and @xmath42 0 , contribute ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) as pointed out in refs .  @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cutoff smaller than 2 @xmath11 determined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite leads to cutting the  repulsive \" part completely , and this corresponds to choosing the plateau around 2 @xmath11 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , as proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the case of the skyrme force . </S>",
    "<S> the present result does not agree with these previous ones . </S>",
    "<S> reference  @xcite reports a result different from ours . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there are two reasons for this difference . </S>",
    "<S> one reason is that they adopted coupling constants which reproduced the saturation in the hartree - fock approximation , not the hartree ( so - called mft ) approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to larger pairing gaps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other reason is the difference in the evaluation of the dirac sea effects </S>",
    "<S> .    figures 2(a ) and ( b ) show how well the @xmath9-@xmath10 model with @xmath30 chosen above reproduces @xmath15 and @xmath19 , respectively , obtained with the bonn - b potential for symmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> one can see some deviations between the two models both near @xmath36 0.2 @xmath11 and @xmath36 1.2 @xmath11 . as for the former , </S>",
    "<S> it is quite reasonable that the present model based on the mean field picture for finite - density systems does not give a good fit . </S>",
    "<S> actually , in such an extremely dilute system , the effective - range approximation for the free scattering is quite good  @xcite . as for the latter , the deviation results from the fact that the superfluid phase in the rmf model , as well as in the gogny force case  @xcite , disappears in a nearly @xmath21-independent manner at somewhat larger @xmath32 than in the bonn potential case . </S>",
    "<S> this at the same time causes the overall peak shift of @xmath15 to larger @xmath32 and makes @xmath19 at large @xmath32 small . </S>",
    "<S> we should note , however , that the critical density or @xmath32 , where the pairing gap disappears , has not been fully discussed yet . </S>",
    "<S> the result for pure neutron matter is very similar , except that @xmath15 is somewhat larger as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , and the superfluid phase survives up to somewhat larger @xmath32 , due to larger values of @xmath43 than in the symmetric matter case . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the present method gives a good fit still for @xmath36 1.2 @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the density of neutron matter in the inner crust of neutron stars corresponds to 0.2 @xmath11 @xmath44 @xmath32 @xmath44 1.3 @xmath11  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the present simple method covers the greater part of this range . in finite nuclei , pairing occurs near the nuclear surface , where the density is lower than the saturation point . </S>",
    "<S> the present method gives a good description of this region .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we proposed a method to reproduce the @xmath0 pairing properties of infinite nuclear matter , obtained using a sophisticated dbhf plus a full - range gap equation adopting the bonn potential , by introducing a momentum cutoff into the gap equation with the relativistic mean field model . </S>",
    "<S> this method was shown to be applicable in a wide and physically relevant density range . </S>",
    "<S> this points the way to consistent ( i.e. , using the same interaction in the p - h and the p - p channels ) relativistic hfb studies of neutron stars and finite nuclei . finally , we remark that the cutoff we introduced is density - independent , since our approach is based on the density - independent  except the dependence through @xmath43  rmf interaction which was determined at the saturation point . </S>",
    "<S> this deserves further investigation . </S>"
