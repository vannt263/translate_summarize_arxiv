    "stability is ubiquitous in biology , ranging from physicochemical homeostasis in cellular microenvironments to ecological constancy and resilience @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that not only can the stability phenomenon arise in normal living systems , but it can also happen in abnormal organisms such as cancer . as a large family of diseases with abnormal cell growth",
    ", cancer is generally acknowledged to be the malignant progression along with a series of stability - breaking changes ( _ e.g. _ genomic instability ) within the normal organisms @xcite .",
    "however , some recent researches reveal the other side of cancer .",
    "an interesting _ phenotypic equilibrium _ was reported in some cancers @xcite .",
    "that is , the population composed of different cancer cells will tend to a fixed equilibrium of phenotypic proportions over time regardless of initial states ( fig .",
    "these findings provided new insights to the research of cancer heterogeneity .",
    "the experimental works also stimulate theoreticians to put forward reasonable models for interpreting the phenotypic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was reported that the intrinsic interconversion between different cellular phenotypes , also called _ phenotypic plasticity _",
    "@xcite , could play a crucial role in stabilizing the mixture of phenotypic proportions in cancer . as a pioneering work , gupta _ et al _ proposed a discrete - time markov chain model to describe the phenotypic transitions in breast cancer cell lines @xcite . in their model , three phenotypes",
    "were identified : stem - like cells ( s ) , basal cells ( b ) and luminal cells ( l ) .",
    "the phenotypic transitions among them can be captured by the transition probability matrix as follows :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 represents the probability of the transition from phenotype @xmath3 to @xmath4 . according to the limiting theory of discrete - time finite - state markov chain , there exists unique equilibrium distribution @xmath5 such that @xmath6 , provided @xmath7 is irreducible and aperiodic @xcite",
    ". the markov chain will converge to @xmath8 regardless of where it begins . by fitting the markov chain model to their experimental data , the equilibrium proportions of stem - like ,",
    "basal and luminal cells were predicted by the equilibrium distribution @xmath9 respectively .    even though the markov chain model fitted the experimental results in breast cancer cell lines very well , zapperi and la porta @xcite questioned the validity of the phenotypic transitions and gave an alternative explanation to the phenotypic equilibrium , which was based on the conventional cancer stem cell ( csc ) model with imperfect csc biomarkers .",
    "moreover , liu _",
    "et al _ showed that the negative feedback mechanisms of non - linear growth kinetics of cancer cells can also control the balance between different cellular phenotypes @xcite .",
    "these works suggested that the phenotypic plasticity may not be the only explanation to the phenotypic equilibrium . to further reveal the mechanisms giving rise to the phenotypic equilibrium , it is more convincing to study the models integrating the phenotypic plasticity with the other conventional cellular processes of cancer .",
    "motivated by this , a series of works discussed the phenotypic equilibrium by establishing the models coordinating with both hierarchical cancer stem cell paradigm and phenotypic plasticity @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the phenotypic equilibria were intimately related to the stable steady - state behavior of the corresponding ordinary differential equations ( odes ) models .",
    "in other words , if one can model the dynamics of the phenotypic proportions as the following system of odes    @xmath10    the unique stable fixed point @xmath11 ( if exists ) corresponds to the equilibrium proportions .",
    "the aforementioned works have showed that the phenotypic equilibrium can be explained by different concepts of stabilities in different models .",
    "thus a natural question is whether there exists a unified framework to harmonize the equilibrium distribution of the markov chain model and the stable steady - state behavior of the odes model . in this study",
    ", we try to address this issue by establishing a multi - phenotype branching ( mpb ) model @xcite .",
    "on one hand , our model integrates the phenotypic plasticity with the cellular processes ( such as cell divisions ) that have extensively been studied in cancer biology . on the other hand ,",
    "the model is stochastic and closer to the reality with finite population size @xcite .",
    "based on this model , it is shown that the odes model can be derived by taking the expectation of our model .",
    "more specifically , the odes model is just the _ proportion equation _ of the mpb model . besides",
    ", the markov chain model is also shown to be closely related to our model .",
    "that is , the kolmogorov forward equation of the continuous - time markov chain model is a special case of the proportion equation provided that the division rates of stem - like , basal and luminal cells are the same . interestingly , ``",
    "same doubling time '' of the three phenotypes was just observed in gupta _",
    "et al _ s experiment when they used the markov chain model to explain the phenotypic equilibrium @xcite , which is in line with our theoretical prediction .",
    "moreover , our result also shows that one should be more cautious about the application of the markov chain in modeling cell - state dynamics in larger time scales , since the markov chain model takes no account of different capabilities of divisions by cancer stem cells and non - stem cancer cells .",
    "more importantly , by showing _ almost sure convergence _ of the mpb model , the stationarity of the markov chain model and the stability of the odes model can be unified as the average - level stability of our model .",
    "note that the almost sure convergence indicates the path - wise stability of stochastic samples , providing a more profound explanation to the phenotypic equilibrium .",
    "in other words , the phenotypic equilibrium is actually rooted in the stochastic nature of ( almost ) every path sample ; the average - level stability just follows from it by averaging all the stochastic samples .",
    "furthermore , it is also shown that , not only can the model with phenotypic plasticity give rise to the path - wise convergence , but the conventional cancer stem cell model without phenotypic plasticity can also lead to the convergence under certain conditions .",
    "this echoes the works @xcite that the phenotypic plasticity is not the only explanation to the phenotypic equilibrium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is presented in section 2 .",
    "main results are shown in section 3 .",
    "conclusions are in section 4 .",
    "in this section we give the assumptions of our model . consider a population composed of different cancer cell phenotypes .",
    "for pure theoretical investigations , the number of the phenotypes can be any @xmath12 in general @xcite .",
    "however , to better illustrate our theoretical results on the basis of more concrete biological background , enlightened by @xcite , we here focus on the specific model consisting of three phenotypes : stem - like cells ( s ) , basal cells ( b ) and luminal cells ( l ) .",
    "the main assumptions are listed as follow : + _ 1_. stem - like cells can perform three types of divisions : symmetric division , symmetric differentiation and asymmetric division @xcite .",
    "that is , a stem - like cell can divide into two identical stem - like cells ( symmetric division ) or two identical differentiated cancer cells ( symmetric differentiation ; it can also divide into a stem - like cell and a differentiated cancer cell ( asymmetric division ) .",
    "* symmetric division : s @xmath13 s+s ; * symmetric differentiation : s @xmath14 b+b or s @xmath15 l+l ; * asymmetric division : s @xmath16 s+b or s @xmath17 s+l .",
    "@xmath18 is the division rate ( or termed synthesis rate @xcite ) , with the meaning that a stem - like cell will wait an exponential time with expectation @xmath18 and then perform one particular type of division with probability @xmath19 ( note that @xmath20 ) .",
    "suppose the waiting time and the division strategy are independent to each other , then the product of @xmath18 and @xmath19 governs the reaction rate of the corresponding division type .",
    "2_. for non - stem cancer cells , _ i.e. _ basal or luminal cells , we assume that not only can they undergo symmetric divisions with limited times , but they can also perform phenotypic conversions . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us take b phenotype as an example .",
    "suppose a newly - born b cell can divide at most @xmath21 times .",
    "if we denote @xmath22 as the b cell that has already divided @xmath3 times , then we have the following hierarchical structure :    * @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25+@xmath25 ; * ... * @xmath26 @xmath24 @xmath27+@xmath27 ; * @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the division rate , and @xmath31 is the death rate of @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , assume that a b cell can convert into an s cell ( termed _ de - differentiation _",
    "@xcite ) by phenotypic plasticity . let the dedifferentiation rate of @xmath32 be @xmath33 , then we have    * @xmath23 @xmath34 s ; * ... * @xmath27 @xmath35 s.    for simplicity , it is often assumed that @xmath36 @xcite , denoted as @xmath37 for short .",
    "meanwhile , note that a b cell can also convert into an l cell @xcite .",
    "since the biological mechanisms of the phenotypic conversions between different non - stem cancer cells are still poorly understood , for simplicity it is assumed that the phenotypic transitions between b and l can only happen in the same hierarchical level . that is , supposing that a newly - born l cell can also divide at most @xmath21 times",

    "their cellular processes are shown as follows :    * @xmath40 @xmath46 @xmath47+@xmath47  ( @xmath48 ) ; * @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath29 . * @xmath40 @xmath51 s  ( @xmath52 ) ; * @xmath40 @xmath53 @xmath32  ( @xmath52 ) .      based on the cellular processes listed in the last subsection , we can model this cellular system as a continuous - time markov process in the discrete state space of cell numbers ( chapter 11 in @xcite ) .",
    "if we let @xmath54 be the cell number of s phenotype , @xmath55 be the vector representing the cell numbers of @xmath32 cells , and @xmath56 be the vector representing the cell numbers of @xmath40 cells , then the dynamics of @xmath57 can be modeled as a multi - phenotype branching process @xcite .",
    "if we define @xmath58 be the probability of @xmath59 at time @xmath60 , according to the theory of _ chemical master equation _",
    "( cme ) , the rate of change of @xmath58 is equal to the transitions into @xmath61 minus the transitions out of it , _",
