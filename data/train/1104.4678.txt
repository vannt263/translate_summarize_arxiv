    "lattice models of interacting bosons and fermions such as hubbard model and its various generalizations are usually strongly correlated systems exhibiting various phases with competing orders , which are of fundamental interest in fields of both condensed matter and cold atomic physics .",
    "interests on both types of hubbard models are renewed recently , since they can be realized in cold atomic gases loaded in optical lattices ( for a review see refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] and references therein ) . unlike fermions",
    ", there is a natural superfluid order for free bosons at zero temperature driven by the kinetic energy .",
    "when the interaction is switched on , the bosons are likely to be localized in various crystalline patterns , which may coexist with superfluid order @xcite to give a realization of intriguing `` supersolid '' state that has been pursued for decades since 1950s @xcite .",
    "recently , people have observed the non - classical rotational inertia in solidified @xmath3he @xcite implying a possible supersolid state , which , in spite of the controversy over this topic , also triggers extensive studies on various boson hubbard models .",
    "experimentally , the boson hubbard model can be used to mimic the granular superconductors , where the cooper pairs are described as bosons , which has been studied by fisher _",
    "[ ] two decades ago , where with only on - site repulsive interaction they showed that bosons can form either mott insulating state with integer filling or superfluid state .",
    "recent experimental progress in cold atomic system provides another realization of boson hubbard model by loading atoms into an optical lattice with possible long range interactions through dipole interaction @xcite , or mediated by other intermediate states or fermions @xcite .",
    "in addition , the boson models also share similarities with quantum magnets , e.g. , the uniaxial magnetization corresponds to insulating states of boson hubbard model ( e.g. ref . ) , while the easy - plane magnetization corresponds to the superfluid state .",
    "hence , the studies on the boson hubbard model may shed light on some common issues of strongly correlated lattice models .",
    "generally speaking , boson models with interactions at zero temperature have two principal phases : ( i ) the superfluid and ( ii ) the incompressible insulating state , which are favored respectively by kinetic and interaction energies , and can coexist . depending on the features of interaction terms , there are several types of insulating phases , such as mott , valence bond crystal , and charge density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "note that we in this article define the incompressible states with oscillating density profile as cdw , though the bosons may not carry charges .",
    "the extended boson hubbard ( ebh ) model with onsite ( @xmath4 ) and nearest neighbor ( @xmath1 ) interactions is a minimal model in favor of cdw and supersolid phases , which has the form of @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) bosonic operator at site @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the hopping amplitude , @xmath10 is the particle number , @xmath0 is the chemical potential , and @xmath11 runs over all nearest neighbors .",
    "recently , hamiltonian eq .   and its hard - core version ( equivalent to the quantum spin-1/2 xxz model ) with different underlying lattices have been extensively studied in different parameter regimes @xcite . however , a global phase diagram of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ebh model [ eq . ] is still of lack . as there is no sign problem for the ebh model ,",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation is the most convenient tool for this purpose .",
    "the worm algorithm @xcite will be invoked to study hamiltonian on a simple cubic lattice , together with other perturbation and mean - field approaches .",
    "the system described by the ebh model can give rise to a charge ordered crystal at commensurate fillings .",
    "the first one is for half filling @xmath12 , and the corresponding solid state is labeled as cdw i. doping",
    "_ particles _ into this state can lead to a supersolid state @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , doping _",
    "holes _ into it acts quite differently , which may not result in a supersolid state with @xmath13 , but a phase separation between superfluid and cdw i states , which signals a first - order phase transition .",
    "their argument is based upon the following two observations .",
    "( i ) taking one particle out of a perfect cdw crystal with half filling costs almost no potential energy , but only chemical potential . at the same time",
    ", the hopping hole also gains a kinetic energy which is quadratic in @xmath9 @xmath14 .",
    "for a perfect cdw crystal , these three processes are balanced , so one can not take one particle out .",
    "( ii ) the cdw phase breaks the translational symmetry , leading to a two - fold degenerate ground state .",
    "if holes are doped into the domain wall between these two degenerate phases , the kinetic energy gained is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the cdw phase is unstable toward the domain wall formation if the hole density exceeds @xmath15 for @xmath16 lattice , though it is still stable against losing one particle .",
    "this argument perfectly explains the first - order phase transition from the cdw i to superfluid state with @xmath17 , but it fails in two circumstances .",
    "the first is that in one dimension the kinetic energy is always linear in @xmath9 , and the corresponding transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless type @xcite .",
    "the other is that if @xmath1 is comparable to @xmath9 the kinetic energy of holes is also linear in @xmath9 , which may result in the supersolid phase with the particle density less than half filling ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : case - finite - t ] ) . this can be verified by the mean - field calculations @xcite .    at unitary",
    "filling , the ground state can be either a uniform mott insulator with one particle per site or a charge ordered crystal with two particles on one sublattice and empty on the other one which is labeled as cdw ii .",
    "there is a critical region around @xmath18 , where the two states with different translation symmetries become degenerate , and however , they are separated thermodynamically , i.e. , any local perturbation can not take one to the other .",
    "correspondingly , the transition between them is a first - order one .",
    "it is noted that the aforementioned transition from the superfluid to cdw i state by tuning the chemical potential is of the _ weak _ first - order @xcite .",
    "far less attention has been paid to the region with @xmath19 by now , of which the details are given as part of the phase diagram in this article .",
    "to plot the ground state phase diagram , we focus on the case with small hopping and average particle density around or smaller than 1 . for larger @xmath9 or @xmath20 , we expect no essentially new physics .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ground - state - phase ] , we shall present the global phase diagram .",
    "the details of the order parameters will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : order - parameters ] . the conclusion will be given in last section .",
    "we start from the classical case without hopping .",
    "the energy per site of ground state is a function of the particle numbers on the two sublattices , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coordination number @xmath25 for the simple cubic lattice .",
    "the states can be labeled by @xmath26 .",
    "the mott states correspond to @xmath27 , and the cdw states with @xmath28 break the translational symmetry , which is two - fold degenerate . in this article",
    ", we define the state @xmath29 as cdw i state , and @xmath30 as cdw ii state and we only consider @xmath31 for the cdw states for convenience .",
    "( color online ) the phase diagram with zero hopping @xmath21 , where the states are labeled by the particle numbers on two sublattices @xmath26 with the assumption @xmath32 .",
    "the states with @xmath33 can be obtained by inversion .",
    "the cdw states with one sublattice empty on the right side .",
    "some states can only exist on the green thick solid line , e.g. , the states @xmath34 and @xmath35.,width=226 ]    for @xmath36 the ground state is a vacuum without any particles . as the chemical potential is increased @xmath37 , the particles are loaded into one sublattice to form a charge ordered pattern with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e. , cdw i state .",
    "if we further increase the chemical potential , more particles are loaded into the cubic lattice , which fill either the empty sites if @xmath40 to form a uniform mott state , or the occupied sites if @xmath41 leading to a cdw ii state . in the mott state ,",
    "each particle interacts with its nearest neighbors , which effectively lowers the chemical potential to be @xmath42 , and then the critical line between cdw i and mott states is simply @xmath43 . while that between cdw i and ii states is a horizontal line @xmath44 because the chemical potential only needs to compensate the on - site interaction @xmath4 for adding new particles .",
    "similarly , by studying the instability of adding particle to a state @xmath26 , one can determine all the phase boundaries between different classical insulating states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerot ] .",
    "there is a special vertical line @xmath45 , on which many states can coexist with the same free energy .",
    "for example , on the boundary between mott and cdw ii states , there are actually three macroscopic states , which are ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,0 ) and ( 0,2 ) . in fact , some of them only exist on this line in the absence of hopping terms , e.g. states ( 3,1 ) and ( 1,3 ) on the boundary between mott ( 2,2 ) and cdw ( 4,0 ) states .",
    "these degenerate states are macroscopic which can not be transformed to each other smoothly by local perturbations , i.e. , there are infinitely high barriers between these macroscopic states .",
    "for the case with a finite hopping @xmath9 , the particles ( holes ) adding to an insulating state can gain a kinetic energy , which results in the shrinking of insulating areas in the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] ) comparing with the classical case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zerot ] ) . in three dimensions , these mobile bosons condense at low temperature leading to the superfluidity , which enriches the phase diagram .",
    "there are four phases for the ebh model characterized by the following three quantities : the particle density @xmath20 , superfluid density @xmath46 , and static structure factor @xmath47 at momentum @xmath48 with @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the winding numbers along @xmath51 and @xmath52 directions , @xmath53 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath54 is the effective mass of the bosons . in the insulating mott and cdw states , particles are localized by the interaction and the local particle number is quantized as in the classical case .",
    "the pure superfluid state has nonzero superfluid density @xmath46 and a vanishing static structure factor @xmath47 , while both are finite in the supersolid phase .",
    "( color online ) the phase diagram in the plane of @xmath55 _ vs_. @xmath56 for the extended bose hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice , where @xmath57 and the lattice size is @xmath58 .",
    "four kinds of phases including the superfluid ( sf ) , supersolid ( ss ) , mott and cdw states are identified .",
    "the cdw states are further classified as i and ii by the filling numbers .",
    "the solid lines with circles are the phase boundaries calculated by qmc simulations , and the dotted lines are from the perturbation calculations .",
    "the green lines are the second - order phase boundaries , and the red ones are of the first - order .",
    "the inset is a zoom near the tip of cdw i lobe , where one can find a narrow region below the lobe corresponding to a supersolid phase with the filling less than one half .",

    "[ fig : phasediagram ] is the phase diagram determined by the qmc simulation with the worm update algorithm , where the solid lines with circles are the qmc results and the dotted lines are from the perturbation expansion in the strong coupling limit @xcite where the insulating states become unstable against adding or removing particles .",
    "it is seen that the perturbation results agree quite well with those of the qmc simulation in part of the phase diagram , but it is still not applicable in some regions since it can not deal with the superfluid order .",
    "comparing with the classical case in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerot ] , the cdw i state is detached from its insulating neighbors , i.e. , the mott , cdw ii and vacuum states . the upper boundary of vacuum state",
    "is actually lowered below @xmath59 due to the hopping of bosons , which is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zerot ] .",
    "the gaps between different insulating states are filled with the superfluid and supersolid phases .",
    "the lower boundary of cdw i state is a critical line on which there occurs a phase separation between the superfluid and cdw i phases , which breaks the u(1 ) gauge symmetry and the translational symmetry , respectively .",
    "the transition between them is of the weak first - order across which the particle density and superfluid density have a jump . considering the correspondence between the ebh model and spin models ,",
    "this transition is similar to the spin - flopping process in the two- or three - dimensional anisotropic xxz model in the presence of magnetic field pointing in @xmath52-axis , which is equivalent to the ebh model in the hard - core limit @xcite . as explained in ref .",
    "[ ] , this first - order phase transition with a particle number jump is due to the fact that the cdw i phase is unstable toward the domain wall formation if the filling number exceeds @xmath15 though it is still stable against doping one hole .    doping particles upon the cdw i phase by increasing the chemical potential does not lead to a first - order transition as in the hard - core ebh model ( or equivalently the xxz model ) , where the particle - hole symmetry makes the upper and lower boundaries of cdw i phase identical . in case of the soft - core bosons ,",
    "these additional particles can move upon the alternating charge ordered background with the effective hopping amplitude @xmath60 , which can bose condense at zero temperature without destroying the staggered density order , and thus leads to a supersolid state with @xmath61 .",

    "the transition is of the second - order .",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath64 , the additional particles are added to the occupied sites so that the cdw order is actually enhanced until finally entering into another insulating state , cdw ii , through a _ first_-order phase transition ,",
    "of which the reason is the same as that from the superfluid with @xmath13 to cdw i. in this sense , the staggered density order in supersolid phase is inherited from the cdw i state , not related to the cdw ii state , since doping holes to the cdw ii state can not _ smoothly _ result in the supersolid state .",

    "as long as enough particles are removed , the insulating state becomes unstable towards the formation of domain walls between the two degenerate states , but can still be stable against losing _",
