    "let @xmath4 . it is known @xcite that one may write the number @xmath5 of orbits of @xmath6 acting on the set @xmath7 of distinct @xmath8-tuples in terms of the probabilities @xmath9 that an element of @xmath10 has @xmath11 fixed points .",
    "writing generating functions @xmath12 the two are related by @xmath13 for example , when @xmath14 , it is evident that @xmath15 for all @xmath8 and hence @xmath16    recently , one of us@xcite has considered a similar problem for @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the field of prime - power order @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath19 and let @xmath20 denote the probability that an element of @xmath10 pointwise fixes exactly a subspace of @xmath21 of dimension @xmath11 .",
    "then similarly by the orbit - counting lemma one has @xmath22 the generating function @xmath23 is likewise written in terms of the @xmath20 and @xmath1-binomial coefficients .",
    "the latter are well - known ( the gauss formula ) to count the number of subspaces of a given dimension in an @xmath18-vector space .",
    "the @xmath1-factorial denominators in such expressions are understood as @xmath24 for @xmath25 .    on the other hand , for applications",
    ", we would really like the inverse relationship @xmath20 in terms of @xmath26 . in this note",
    "we provide this inverse in a natural way .",
    "thus :    with the notations above the probabilities @xmath20 of an @xmath11-dimensional fixed subspace are given by @xmath27    for example , it is evident that if @xmath28 then @xmath29 for all @xmath8 .",
    "hence we find :    for @xmath28 the probability of no fixed points is @xmath30    our standard notation for the ( truncated ) q - exponential here is such that @xmath31 as @xmath32 , i.e. it is defined with the factorial of @xmath1-integers @xmath33_q={q^i-1\\over q-1}$ ] . in our case @xmath34 and these @xmath35 factors cancel but the notation reminds us of a divergence if we were to try include the finite group case as @xmath36 .",
    "there are of course many ways to invert a linear relationship .",
    "we mention that one may also , for example , use the method of mbius inversion with respect to a suitable function , see @xcite . on the other hand we will obtain the above inversion in a way that is interesting because it is precisely analogous to the computation for the @xmath37 case based on generating functions .",
    "the only difference is that that one should consider the generating function dummy variable @xmath38 for the purposes of addition and subtraction as a braided one , i.e. the polynomials @xmath39 $ ] as a hopf algebra , but in a braided category where @xmath38 has braid statistics @xmath1 ( the affine ` braided line ' ) .",
    "( the idea here is similar to that of a superspace but instead of a ` fermionic ' factor @xmath40 there is a factor @xmath1 when @xmath38 is interchanged with another independent @xmath38 . )",
    "the systematic passage from permutation groups to linear groups over finite fields by means of switching on a braiding would appear to be an interesting direction suggested by the present work .",
    "the required methods of hopf algebras in braided categories or ` braided groups ' have been introduced some years ago@xcite , precisely as the the basic structure underlying quantum groups and @xmath1-analysis , @xcite@xcite .",
    "we recall what we need in a self - contained preliminary section  2 . working with @xmath38 as a braided variable",
    "we relate , in section  3 , the signed generating function @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 on the right is subtraction under the additive braided group structure of the braided line .",
    "we can then immediately invert the relationship as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is subtraction under the opposite additive braided group structure ( it is not commutative ) .",
    "this gives the above inversion formula , essentially without computation .",
    "it also exhibits a novel duality phenomenon whereby the coefficients of @xmath47 are given in terms of those of @xmath48 by exactly the same formula as vice - versa , but with @xmath1 and @xmath2 interchanged .",
    "this is discussed in section  4 .",
    "we briefly recall the definition of braided groups and the braided line .",
    "once these are understood , the computation itself in the next section will be immediate .",
    "the formal definition of a braided category is in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a category @xmath49 , a functor @xmath50 and natural transformations @xmath51 and @xmath52 obey respectively hexagon and pentagon identities .",
    "in addition there is a trivial object @xmath53 and associated functorial isomorophisms of identity with respect to @xmath54 .",
    "a braided group@xcite@xcite is first of all a unital algebra @xmath55 in such a category , defined in the obvious way except that the identity must be viewed as a morphism @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , we require a coalgebra structure @xmath57 ( the coproduct ) and @xmath58 ( the counit ) obeying axioms which are the same as for an algebra but with arrows reversed .",
    "these @xmath59 are required to be algebra homomorphisms , where @xmath60 has the braided tensor product algebra structure .",
    "its product @xmath61 consists of @xmath62 to interchange the middle factors followed by products @xmath63 in @xmath55 , as well as @xmath64 as needed to order brackets .",
    "finally , there is an antipode or ` linearized inverse ' morphism @xmath65 obeying @xmath66    @xmath67    the theory of braided groups can be developed similarly to that of quantum groups or hopf algebras . a useful ( but not necessary ) tool is to use a diagrammatic notation as follows .",
    "one omits @xmath64 and brackets .",
    "one denotes @xmath54 by juxtaposition , the braiding by @xmath68 and its inverse by @xmath69 .",
    "algebraic operations are then drawn as ` flow charts ' flowing from the top of the page downwards .",
    "general morphisms such as @xmath70 are drawn as nodes .",
    "all of this is as for any braided category .",
    "finally , we denote the product and coproduct of @xmath55 by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the principal axioms of a braided group are shown in this notation in figure  1 .",
    "one of the key lemmas that we will need is :    @xcite @xmath70 is braided - antimultiplicative and anticomultiplicative , @xmath73    we will also need that if @xmath55 is a braided group in @xmath49 with @xmath70 invertible then @xmath74 with the original algebra and counit provide another braided group structure @xmath75 in the category @xmath76 defined as @xmath49 but with @xmath77 interchanged ( i.e. with reversed braid crossings ) .    in our elementary application we work in the category @xmath78 of @xmath79-graded vector spaces @xmath80 , etc . with its usual @xmath54 and ( trivial )",
    "@xmath64 , but with @xmath81extended linearly .",
    "morphisms are degree preserving maps .",
    "we work over any field @xmath82 . the unit object is @xmath83 .",
    "the algebra of polynomials @xmath84 $ ] lives in this category ( all its structure maps are morphisms ) with @xmath85 . we make it into a braided group ( the ` affine braided line ' ) with @xmath86 this looks like the usual additive group hopf algebra structure on an affine line but @xmath87 extends differently as a homomorphism to the braided tensor product .",
    "the braided tensor algebra @xmath60 is generated by @xmath88 and @xmath89 with the relations @xmath90 ( the so - called ` quantum plane ' ) . then @xmath91 which exhibits @xmath87 as the operation of addition with respect to braided variables where independent @xmath92 @xmath1-commute ( to emphasise this one may write @xmath93 , which is the notation indicated in ( [ barlp]-([pbarl ] ) ) . working directly from the braided anti / homomorphism properties of @xmath70 and @xmath87",
    "one also has explicitly @xmath94_q x^j{\\mathop{\\otimes}}x^{i - j},\\quad s(x^i)=q^{i(i-1)\\over 2}(-x)^i,\\label{deltasx}\\ ] ] where @xmath95_q = { ( q^i-1)\\cdots ( q^{i - j+1}-1)\\over(q^j-1)\\cdots ( q-1)}={[i]_q!\\over [ j]_q![i - j]_q!}.\\label{qbinom}\\ ] ] clearly , the elementary properties of braided groups mentioned above can easily be verified directly from these definitions and boil down to a number of useful identities for @xmath1-binomial coefficients , not all of them obvious .",
    "the braided line can be viewed as the ` correct ' setting for q - analysis in one variable including jackson s q - derivative and q - integration@xcite , q - exponentials , as well as a new theory of q - fourier transforms@xcite@xcite .",
    "such methods in particular solved the long - standing problem of extending @xmath1-differential calculus to the multivariable case on affine @xmath1-planes ( these turn out to be additive braided groups ) .",
    "as in @xcite we write ( [ lp ] ) as @xmath98 or , changing the order of summation and using the q - binomial notation , @xmath99_q q^{j(j-1)\\over 2}x^j .\\label{lpbinom}\\ ] ]    now consider the algebra homomorphism @xmath100\\to k$ ] which ` evaluates at 1 ' , @xmath101 using this and the structure of the braided line recalled above , we clearly have @xmath102_q q^{j(j-1)\\over 2}(-x)^j\\label{barlxp}\\\\ & = & ( \\phi{\\mathop{\\otimes}}s)\\sum_{i=0}^dp_i\\sum_{j=0}^i\\left[{i\\atop j}\\right]_q x^{i - j}{\\mathop{\\otimes}}x^j=(\\phi{\\mathop{\\otimes}}s)\\circ\\delta p(x)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the precise meaning of ( [ barlp ] )",
    ".    the linear operator @xmath103 which maps @xmath47 to @xmath48 has inverse @xmath104    @xmath105    the proof is shown in figure  2 in the diagrammatic notation .",
    "the composition @xmath106 is depicted in the first line in figure  2(c ) . here",
    "@xmath107 is linear so we can move the output of @xmath108 in @xmath109 to the end of the computation as shown ( remember that juxtaposition at the bottom of the line denotes tensor product ) .",
    "we cancel @xmath110 , then use coassociativity of @xmath87 .",
    "finally we use that @xmath108 is an algebra homomorphism and cancel an ` antipode loop ' using the axiom of an antipode .",
    "the resulting counit combines with @xmath87 to the identity ( the counity axiom ) .",
    "note that @xmath108 is not a morphism in @xmath78 but we do not use this ( we apply @xmath108 only at the end of each diagrammatic expression ) . similarly for the lower line of figure  2(c ) . since these techniques may be unfamiliar",
    ", we also write the proof more conventionally .",
    "thus , @xmath111 and similarly for @xmath112 . these proofs amount to a series of q - identities among q - binomial coefficients by writing out @xmath113 explicitly on monomials @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath115    it remains only to compute @xmath107 explicitly .",
    "we write @xmath116 ( without any factorial factors )",
    ". then @xmath117_q x^{i - j}{\\mathop{\\otimes}}x^j\\ ] ] @xmath118_q x^j\\ ] ] giving @xmath119_q q^{-j(j-1)\\over 2}q^{-j(i - j)}(-x)^j.\\label{pbarlx}\\ ] ]    we can then put in the form of @xmath120 in terms of @xmath121 and reorder the summation to extract the @xmath20 .",
    "thus @xmath122 @xmath123 or @xmath20 as stated in proposition  1.1 .",
    "this completes our proof of that .",
    "using one of the basic results from braided group theory , namely the second part of lemma  2.1 , we can also write @xmath125 which is the other expression shown in figure  2(b ) and the precise meaning of ( [ pbarl ] ) .",
    "this computes more directly as ( [ pbarlx ] ) , with @xmath126 coming from the braiding @xmath127 and @xmath128 from @xmath129 .",
    "we see that @xmath107 has just the same form as @xmath109 but with @xmath130 and @xmath131 in place of @xmath132 .",
    "this is the opposite braided group structure on @xmath39 $ ] , namely the same form on degree 1 but developed as a braided group in the category @xmath133 .",
    "one may also see this explicitly by observing that @xmath134_{q^{-1}}=q^{-j(i - j)}\\left[{i\\atop j}\\right]_q\\ ] ] so that ( [ pbarlx ] ) can be written as @xmath135_{q^{-1 } }   q^{-j(j-1)\\over 2 } ( -x)^j\\label{pbarlx2}\\ ] ] which has the same form as our original ( [ barlxp ] ) .",
    "@xmath115    finally , we mention another way to obtain the above duality using braided group theory , this time in the form of ` q - analysis ' .",
    "namely , the displacement of a function by @xmath24 can be written as a q - exponential of q - derivatives ( the braided taylor s theorem@xcite ) . in the present one - variable case",
    "it is easily verified on monomials and takes the form @xmath136_q!}\\ ] ] acting on polynomials ( the sum is only finite ) . here",
    "@xmath137 is jackson s @xmath1-derivative@xcite .",
    "( also in our case one can cancel the @xmath35 factors here and in @xmath33_q$ ] ! if one prefers . )",
    "moreover , @xmath138 for any nilpotent operator @xmath139 as one may see by q - differentiating ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2.2 ) . hence @xmath140 the second equality here is easily verified on monomials .",
