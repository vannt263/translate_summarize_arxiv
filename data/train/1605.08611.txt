    "lacoo@xmath0 is a perovskite , which has the rare earth la on the a - site and co on the b - site , which corresponds to the center of the oxygen octahedron .",
    "however , like most of the perovskites , lacoo@xmath0 has oxygen octahedral rotations ( fig .",
    "[ sfig : structure ] ) which involve the oxygen octahedra rotating out - of - phase around the [ 111 ] axes of the undistorted cubic highsymmetry structure .",
    "the rotation pattern in glazer notation is @xmath14 , which corresponds to the space group r@xmath37c ( # 167 ) .    as noted by thornton et .",
    "@xcite , lacoo@xmath0 has large thermal expansion and the octahedral rotation angle also changes with temperature . in our study , we used four different crystal structures to isolate and study the effect of different lattice parameters on the spin state transition .",
    "we used the two different experimental structures observed at 1143k and 4k , which we denote by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "comparing the electronic structure for these two crystal structures provides a means to study the temperature evolution of the electronic structure .",
    "in addition to these two , we also built two cubic perovskite crystal structures with the same inter - lanthanum spacing as them , but with no octahedral rotations .",
    "these structures , denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , enabled us to isolate the effect of oxygen octahedral rotations on the electronic structure of lacoo@xmath0 .    .",
    "each of the oxygen octadra rotates in the opposite direction to all nearest neighbour octahedra by the same amount relative to all three coordinate axes ( @xmath14 structure).,height=288 ]",
    "we performed fully charge self - consistent embedded dft+dmft",
    "calculations@xcite@xcite@xcite on @xmath12 .",
    "our implementation is based on the wien2k all - electron dft package.@xcite for the dft functional we use the gga - pbe functional .",
    "we employed a 10 atom unit cell for the 2 structures with rotations and 5 atom unit cells for the two structures without rotations and used 512 k points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "our dmft implementation uses state - of - the - art ctqmc@xcite impurity solver based on the hybridization expansion ( ctqmc - hyb ) and all simulations are iterated to self - consistency .",
    "it is to be noted that our implementation makes use of projectors to embed / project out the impurity self - energy onto the lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "this prevents errors associated with downfolding using wannier orbitals and allows us to achieve highly accurate charge self - consistency.@xcite we also account for octahedral rotations , wherever present , by applying local rotations so as to align our correlated orbitals with the local crystal field set up by the neighboring atoms . in our simulations , we use a hubbard u of 6.0 ev and hund s coupling ( j ) of 0.7ev .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of varying the value of j , and found that this does not change the temperature at which the transitions occur , but merely changes the value of the observed @xmath24 by a small amount , with higher j values resulting in slightly larger values .",
    "we ignored the spin - orbit interaction , as it is expected to be small in this 3d transition metal oxide .",
    "the typical self - consistent calculation requires 30 self consistency cycles each with around 10 dft iterations and one ctqmc iteration per cycle .",
    "our lda+dmft calculations gave us the green s function ( @xmath38 ) on the imaginary ( matsubara ) axis which we analytically continued using the maximum entropy method to get the density of states on the real axis .",
    "dmft is based on mapping the original lattice problem to an auxilliary impurity problem .",
    "we minimize the action of this impurity problem defined by :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is imaginary time , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote angular momentum and spin labels,@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the annihilation and creation operators for impurity electrons , @xmath45 is the hybridization function between our impurity and the bath , which encodes most of the lattice information .",
    "the on - site coulomb repulsion between the co d - electrons is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes spherical harmonics and @xmath49 denote slater integrals .",
    "the ctqmc impurity solver gives us the impurity self - energy @xmath50 .",
    "since correlations are very local in real space , we embed this self - energy by expanding it in terms of quasi - localized atomic orbitals,@xmath51 ;    @xmath52    where @xmath53 denote the sites of co atoms in the most general cluster - dmft implementation and @xmath54 denote the atomic degrees of freedom for each site .",
    "since , we perform single site dmft , @xmath55 becomes @xmath56 .",
    "we then solve the dyson equation in real space ( or an equivalent complete basis such as the kohn - sham basis ) according to the equation :    @xmath57    this procedure is what we define as embedded dmft , because the self energy is embedded into a large hilbert space instead of constructing a hubbard - like model by downfolding to a few bands using wannier orbitals .",
    "this method has the advantage that the correlations are much more localized in real space compared to the wannier representation , which makes dmft a much better approximation . in addition , this formulation of dft+dmft can be shown to be derivable from the luttinger ward functional which makes the formulation stationary and conserving @xcite .",
    "while calculating the density of states(dos ) at @xmath58 for the different structures at different temperatures , we ensured that their fermi energies were adjusted such that the energy levels for the oxygen densities of states lay at the same energy values .",
    "this was required because there was an ambiguity in the value of the chemical potential at temperatures where the structure gave rise to an insulating band - gap and we believe an accurate comparison can only be made if some features of the dos are held fixed .",
    "this procedure required a shift in the chemical potential of some of the simulations of the order of 0.1 ev .",
    "the results we plot in fig 2b are obtained after these shifts are put in .",
    "figure 1 on the other hand plots the densities of states before any such post - processing has been done .",
    "this leads to small differences between the two figures . instead of fixing the oxygen levels",
    ", we also tried fixing the lanthanum f levels and this gave rise to very similar results .",
    "we firmly believe that our results displayed in figure 2b are robust and it is merely the relevant magnitudes of the y - axis values at high temperatures that fluctuate by a small amount ( depending on which features are held fixed ) and not the actual temperature at which the charge - gap closure takes place .",
    "we also do not plot the dos at @xmath58 but the average of the dos at five points around @xmath58 as this takes care of some of the numerical noise that creeps into our calculation due to both monte carlo noise and the errors in analytic continuation .",
    "we also tested our results by averaging over different number of points and no significant changes take place that would affect our claims ."

    "<S> the spin state transition in lacoo@xmath0 has eluded description for decades despite concerted theoretical and experimental effort . in this study , we approach this problem using charge consistent density functional theory + embedded dynamical mean field theory ( dft+dmft ) . </S>",

    "<S> we also show that the spin state transition and the metal - insulator transition in lacoo@xmath0 occur at different temperature scales . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our results shed light on the importance of electronic entropy , which has so far been ignored in all first principles studies of this material .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin state transition in lacoo@xmath0 has been the subject of intensive investigation for decades.@xcite this compound is established to be a narrow bandgap insulator at low temperature with pauli - like magnetic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> however between 90 - 150 k , it transitions to a local moment phase with a curie - weiss like susceptibility which reaches its peak around 150k . </S>",
    "<S> it also undergoes a gradual closing of the insulating gap and is known to be metallic above 600k @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there is considerable debate regarding the mechanism of this transition , mainly due to the uncertainty regarding the multiplet of the @xmath1 ion which characterizes the excited state of the compound . the cobalt ion in lacoo@xmath0 is commonly considered to have a formal valence of @xmath2 and to be in the @xmath3 state . </S>",
    "<S> the scale of the crystal field splitting is comparable to hunds coupling energy scale . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , one would expect that as temperature is increased , there would be an entropy - driven transition from the low spin ( ls ) @xmath4 state with a fully filled @xmath5 shell ( @xmath6 ) to an @xmath7 high spin ( hs ) state ( @xmath8)@xcite . indeed there is experimental evidence that does support such a scenerio . </S>",
    "<S> electron spin resonance@xcite , neutron scattering @xcite , x - ray absorbtion spectroscopy , and magnetic circular dichroism experiments@xcite point towards a transition to an hs state . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , no inequivalent co - o bond is found in exafs experiements , which also supports the formation of an hs state due to the hs state not being strongly jahn - teller active @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been noted that in order to explain the xas experimental data , one would have to assume that the crystal field grows with temperature , which is counter - intuitive.@xcite this led to some authors suggesting that there is an ls - hs alternating structure caused by breathing distortions@xcite @xcite and interatomic repulsion between the hs atoms.@xcite    a competing explanation , whereby the excited state is the @xmath9 intermediate spin ( is ) state ( @xmath10 ) , has also become popular@xcite , mainly because of lda+u results which show that the is state is lower in energy compared to the hs state.@xcite the stability of the is state has been justified by the large hybridization of the co 3d electrons with neighboring o 2p electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this causes charge transfer between the ions resulting in the co ion having a @xmath11 structure according to the zaanen - sawatzky - allen scheme,@xcite which in turn would cause stabilization of the is state . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate spin state hypothesis also seems to explain experimental findings such as raman spectroscopy , x - ray photoemission , other xas and eels spectroscopies , as well as susceptibility and thermal expansion measurements . @xcite .    to summarize , there has been a significant amount of debate regarding the true nature of the spin state transition in lacoo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> interest in this compound has also been enhanced in light of recent discoveries of ferromagnetism induced by sr ( hole ) doping @xcite , as well as experiments reporting strain induced magnetism in epitaxially grown thin films.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there have been reports of the emergence of a striped phase in thin films with alternating ls and hs / is regions.@xcite low temperature ferromagnetism has also been reported in experiments on @xmath12 nanoparticles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , there is great interest in understanding the true behavior of this material .    in this letter , we use density functional theory + embedded dynamical mean field theory ( dft+dmft ) to analyze spin state transition of bulk @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> our implementation extremizes the dft+dmft functional in real space , thereby avoiding the downfolding approximation and uses the numerically exact ctqmc impurity solver@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though there are multiple recent studies that use dft+dmft on this compound @xcite , to our knowledge none of them provide a comprehensive analysis of all of the factors governing the transition such as octahedral rotations and electronic entropy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that i ) lacoo@xmath0 has large charge fluctuations and it is not possible to explain the spin state with a single multiplet at any temperature , ii ) the crystal field splitting very sensitively depends on the details of the crystal structure , and taking into account not only the thermal expansion but also the oxygen octahedral rotations is very important , and iii ) it is possible to stabilize an insulating phase ( without orbital order ) at intermediate temperatures where local moments are present , thereby showing that the metal - insulator transition is distinct from the spin state transition in this compound . we also show that iv ) electronic entropy difference between the high and low temperature states is necessary for the stabilization of the different spin states , which is a fact overlooked in various first principle studies so far .    </S>",

    "<S> we show the density of states for all 4 structures , calculated at both low temperature and high temperature ( 116k and 1160k ) using density functional theory + dynamical mean field theory ( dft+dmft ) . unlike dft , which always predicts a metallic state , our calculations correctly reproduce an insulating ground state at low temperature for all the structures . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 orbitals are below the fermi level whereas the @xmath21 orbitals are above the fermi level .    </S>",
    "<S> the charge gap closes continuously with increasing temperature , and as a result , there is a large overlap in energy between the @xmath5 and @xmath21 orbitals at high temperatures . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath17 structure shows some overlap at high temperatures , and the @xmath18 structure almost remains an insulator for the entire range of temperature studied , with only a small overlap developing above 900k . </S>",
    "<S> this shows clearly that octahedral rotations play a large role in decreasing the strength of the crystal field splitting . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by a combination of factors . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation of the oxygen octahedra causes the misalignment of the crystal field of the o atoms with that of the la atoms , which normally reinforce each other in a perovskite with no octahedral rotations . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an overall reduction of the effective crystal field which reduces the charge gap between the @xmath5 and the @xmath21 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this trigonal distortion also leads to a splitting of the @xmath5 orbitals into 2 + 1 orbitals , thereby again reducing the gap with the @xmath21 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these two effects seems to overcome the expected decrease in the bandwith of the @xmath21 orbitals.finally , note that there is a considerable overlap in energy of the o 2p orbitals with the co 3d orbitals , which is very important in producing charge fluctuations on the co ion , making it highly mixed - valent .         with temperature for all four structures . </S>",

    "<S> note that all our calculations are in the paramagnetic state and hence the value of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the largest value of @xmath24 at 1160k is seen for the @xmath15 structure , followed by the @xmath16 structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is in line with the stronger crystal field in the @xmath16 structure due to the smaller lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that the spin state transition starts at a higher temperature for the @xmath16 structure ( @xmath25580k ) compared to the the @xmath15 ( @xmath25380k ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is also consistent with the the low temperature structure having a higher stability for the ls state . </S>",
    "<S> the structures without rotations consistently show a lower buildup of higher spin states than the ones with rotations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 structure displays a spin state transition , but with an eventual high temperature value of @xmath24 that is lower . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the @xmath18 structure shows almost no transition . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the role that the octahedral rotations play in the reduction of the crystal field is essential for the spin state transition .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 2a and 2b also show that the spin state transition and the charge gap closing occur at different temperatures , which is a trend that has been observed in experiment but has not been captured in earlier dmft simulations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , fig 2b shows that both the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 structures show a complete closure of the charge gap at @xmath25 600k whereas fig 2a shows that the spin state transition in the two structures occur at very different temperatures .    _ </S>",
    "<S> nature of the excited spin state _ because of the large hybridization between co and o , the d orbitals of co have large charge fluctuations and all the four structures have an effective d - shell occupation of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore any analysis of the spin states in terms of the ls , is and hs states of the @xmath3 configuration of the co ion is necessarily inadequate . </S>",

    "<S> the initial change in the value of the spin state is predominantly caused by the excitation of the @xmath31 and the @xmath32 multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath33 multiplet sees an increase in probability at higher temperatures ( above 500k ) and also follows a similar trend for all the structures except the @xmath18 structure , where all changes are very small . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the initial signature of the transition is best seen in the behavior of the @xmath34 and @xmath32 multiplets , which can be said to be the hs multiplets for the @xmath3 and @xmath11 occupancies respectively .            in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , we show the occupancy histograms below and above the transition ( at 116k and 1160k).(ctqmc gives us access to the state space probability for each of the 1024 states of the d orbital . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to aid visualization , we only show states which have an occupation probability above 0.001 in any of the structures at any temperature . ) </S>",
    "<S> this figure displays clearly how the transition is marked by the excitation of states in the higher spin multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the low temperature state for all of the structures is marked by the presence of a few states with large probability ( mainly corresponding to the @xmath35 and @xmath30 states ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the spin state transition sets in , a large number of higher spin states get excited and the ls spin states lose weight . </S>",
    "<S> note that the high spin states are highly degenerate so there is no one large peak for the high spin states , but a multitude of lower peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the idea that the transition is primarily an entropy driven transition . </S>",
    "<S> we can also get a good idea of the relative strengths of the transition for the different structures : the largest change occurs in the @xmath15 structure , and the smallest one happens in the @xmath18 .    _ contribution of electronic entropy _ according to the entropy driven transition scenerio , which is supported by calorimetric measurements@xcite , lacoo@xmath0 favors higher spin multiplets at elevated temperatures because of the associated gain in electronic entropy as a result of the high degeneracy of these high spin states - a point missed by first principles calculations at the level of dft . </S>",
    "<S> access to higher spin states is also made easier by a larger lattice constant due to the reduced crystal field , so the gain in electronic entropy could also be a driving factor for the large thermal expansion seen in this material .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the contribution of the electronic entropy to the free energy using our state of the art dft+dmft implementation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we evaluated the free energy and the electronic entropy for both the 4k and 1143k structures ( @xmath16 and @xmath15 ) at 1160k to predict if the structural changes make a considerable difference . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 structure is indeed much higher in electronic entropy compared to the @xmath16 structure at 1160k ; the difference in @xmath36 between these two structures is @xmath25 110 mev per formula unit . </S>",
    "<S> this unusually large difference emphasises the importance of electronic entropy to the transition.we also calculate the energy difference between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 structures to be @xmath25 70mev at 1160k with the @xmath16 being lower in energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see that when the entropy is taken into account and the free energy ( f = e - ts ) is calculated , the high temperature structure @xmath15 becomes more stable purely due to the contribution of electronic entropy . </S>",
    "<S> this result therefore confirms the structural phase transition that is observed as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> so , we can conclude that the electronic entropy , which has been ignored in many first - principles studies of this material , is a leading factor in creating an anomalous thermal expansion and driving the material to a high spin state .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary _ we studied the spin state transition of lacoo@xmath0 using state of the art fully charge self consistent dft+dmft . by using different experimental and hypothetical crystal structures , we disentangled the effect of different components of the crystal structure and showed that both the thermal expansion and the presence of oxygen octahedral rotations have tremendous effect on the spin state transition of lacoo@xmath0 . our single site dmft approach reproduced not only the spin state transition but also the intermediate phase which has nonzero magnetic moment but is insulating . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the spin state and the metal - insulator transitions occur at different temperature scales and that the magnetic - insulating phase can be reproduced without necessarily involving cell doubling via mechanisms such as breathing distortions of spatially inhomogenous mixed spin states . </S>",
    "<S> our results emphasize the importance of charge fluctuations on the co ion due to hybridization with the o anions , and thus point to the inadequacy of a simple spin state picture with only one formal valence . while the spin state transition is concurrent with a sudden change in occupation in the high spin multiplets , low and intermediate spin states also have significant occupation in the whole temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our work is the first calculation of the electronic entropy of lacoo@xmath0 and it points to the fact that the difference of the contribution of entropy to the free energy is significant and is large enough to drive the spin state transition in this material .    _ </S>",
