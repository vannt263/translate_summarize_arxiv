    "nuclei are very interesting objects from the many body point of view .",
    "they are self - bound droplets , i.e. , clusters of fermions ! as we know , this stems from the fact that in nuclear physics , there exist four different fermions : proton , spin up / down , neutron spin up / down . if there were only neutrons , no nuclei would exist .",
    "this is due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "take the case of the @xmath0 particle described approximately by the spherical harmonic oscillator as mean field potential : one can put two protons and two neutrons in the lowest ( s ) level , that is just the @xmath0 particle . with four neutrons",
    "one would have to put two of them in the p - shell what is energetically very penalising , see however @xcite .",
    "neutron matter is unbound whereas symmetric nuclear matter is bound .",
    "of course , this is not only due to the pauli principle . we know that the proton - neutron attraction is stronger than the neutron - neutron ( or proton - proton )",
    "proton and neutron form a bound state , the other two combinations not .",
    "the binding energy of the deuteron ( 1.1 mev / nucleon ) is to a large extent due to the tensor force .",
    "so is the one of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "the @xmath0 particle is the lightest doubly magic nucleus with almost same binding per nucleon ( 7.07 mev ) as the strongest bound nucleus , i.e. , iron ( @xmath6fe ) .",
    "the binding of the deuteron is about seven times weaker than the one of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "the @xmath0 is a very stiff particle .",
    "its first excited state is at @xmath7 20 mev .",
    "this is factors higher than in any other nucleus .",
    "it helps to give to the @xmath0 particle under some circumstances the property of an almost ideal boson .",
    "this happens , once the average density of the system is low as , e.g. in @xmath8be which has an average density at least four times smaller than the nuclear saturation density @xmath9 .",
    "all nuclei , besides @xmath8be , have a ground state density around @xmath9 and can be described to lowest order as an ideal gas of fermions hold together by their proper mean field .",
    "@xmath8be is the only exception forming two loosely bound @xmath0 s , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gfmc_8be ] . for this singular situation exist general arguments but no detailed physical and numerical explanation ( as far as we know ) .",
    "we will come to the discussion of @xmath8be later .",
    "however , radially expanding a heavier nucleus consisting of n@xmath0 particles gives raise to a strong loss of its binding . at a critical expansion , i.e. low density",
    ", it is energetically more favorable that the nucleus breaks up into n@xmath0 particles because each @xmath0 particle can have ( at its center ) saturation .",
    "of course , the sum of surface energies of all @xmath0 particles is penalising but less than the loss of binding due to expansion . for illustration",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:16o_mf ] a pure mean field calculation of @xmath2o which has broken up into a tetrahedron of four @xmath0 particles at low density  @xcite .",
    "of course in this case the @xmath0 s are fixed to definite spatial points and , thus , they form a crystal . in reality , however , the @xmath0 s can move around lowering in this way the energy of the system greatly .",

    "such @xmath0 clustering scenarios are observed when two heavier nuclei collide head on at c.o.m .",
    "energies / particle around the fermi energy .",
    "the nuclei first fuse and compress .",
    "then decompress and at sufficiently low density the system breaks up into clusters .",
    "a great number of @xmath0 particles is detected for central collisions , see @xcite@xcite and references in there .",

    "a very fameous example is the second @xmath11 state at 7.65 mev in @xmath1c , the so - called hoyle state .",
    "its existence was predicted in 1954 by the astrophysicist fred hoyle @xcite and later found practically at the predicted energy by fowler _",
    "this state is supposed to be a loosely bound agglomerate of three @xmath0 particles situated about 300 kev above the 3@xmath0 disintegration threshold . as for the case of @xmath8be ,",
    "this state is hold together by the coulomb barrier .",
    "it is one of the most important states in nuclear physics because it is the gateway for carbon production in the universe through the so - called triple @xmath0 reaction  @xcite and is , thus , responsible for life on earth .",
    "a great part of this article will deal with the description of the properties of this state .",
    "however , it is now believed that there exist heavier nuclei which show similar @xmath0 gas states around the @xmath0 disintegration threshold , for instance @xmath2o around 14.4 mev @xcite .",
    "alpha particles are bosons .",
    "if they are weakly interacting like e.g. , in the hoyle or other states , they may essentially be condensed in the 0s orbit of their own cluster mean field .",
    "we will dwell extensively on this condensation aspect in the main part of the text .",
    "+ clustering and in particular @xmath0 particle clustering has already a long history .",
    "the alpha particle model was first introduced by gamow  @xcite . before the discovery of the neutron",
    ", nuclei were assumed to be composed of @xmath0 particles , protons and electrons . in 1937",
    "wefelmeier  @xcite proposed his well known model where the n@xmath0 particles are arranged in crystalline order in @xmath12 nuclei . in the work of hafstad and teller in 1938",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 s in a selfconjugate nucleus are arranged in close packed form interacting with nearest neighbors .",
    "the energy levels of @xmath2o were discussed by dennison  @xcite with a regular tetrahedron arrangement of the four @xmath0 s .",
    "other forerunners of @xmath0 cluster physics with this kind of models were kameny  @xcite and glassgold and galonsky  @xcite .",
    "the latter discussed energy levels of @xmath1c calculating the rotations and vibrations of an equilateral triangle arrangement of the three @xmath0 s , see also a recent application of this idea in  @xcite discussed below .",
    "several works also tried to solve , e.g. , the 3@xmath0 system in considering the 3-body schrdinger equation with an effective @xmath0-@xmath0 potential reproducing the @xmath0-@xmath0 phase shifts , see two recent publications  @xcite . in the main part of the article we will discuss recent works of this type . in 1956",
    "morinaga came up with the idea that the hoyle state could be a linear chain state of three @xmath0 particles  @xcite .",
    "this at that time somewhat spectacular idea found some echo in the community .",
    "but in the 1970-ties first with the so - called orthogonality condition method ( ocm ) horiuchi  @xcite and shortly later kamimura _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and independently uegaki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the hoyle state is in fact a weakly coupled system of three @xmath0 s or in other words a gas like state of @xmath0 particles in relative s - states .",
    "the emerging picture then was that the hoyle state is of low density where a third @xmath0 particle is orbiting in an s - wave around a @xmath8be - like object also being in an s - wave .",
    "actually both groups in @xcite started with a fully microscopic 12 nucleon wave function where the c.o.m .",
    "part involving the c.o.m .",
    "jacobi coordinates of the @xmath0 particles was to be determined by a variational resonating group method ( rgm ) calculation in the first case and by a generator coordinate method ( gcm ) one in the second case  @xcite .",
    "slight variants of the volkov force  @xcite were used .",
    "all known properties of the hoyle state were reproduced in both cases with this parameter free calculations . besides the hoyle state several other states were predicted and agreement with experiment found .",
    "the second @xmath13 state was only confirmed very recently  @xcite .",
    "the achievements of these works were so outstanding and ahead of their time that ",
    "one is tempted to sayas often after such an exploit the physics of the hoyle state stayed essentially dormant for roughly a quarter century .",
    "it was only in 2001 where a new aspect of the hoyle state came on the forefront of discussion .",
    "tohsaki , horiuchi , schuck , and rpke ( thsr ) proposed that the hoyle state and other n@xmath0 nuclei as , for instance , @xmath2o with excitation energies roughly around the alpha disintegration threshold form actually an @xmath0 particle condensate .",
    "they proposed a wave function of the ( particle number projected ) bcs type , however , the pair wave function replaced by a quartet one formed by a wide gaussian for the c.o.m . motion and an intrinsic translationally invariant @xmath0 particle wave function with a free space extension .",
    "the variational solution with respect to the single size parameter of the c.o.m .",
    "gaussian gave an almost 100 @xmath14 squared overlap with kamimura s wave function  @xcite , thus , proving that implicitly the latter one has the more simplified ( analytic ) structure of the thsr wave function .",
    "additionally it was later shown that thsr predicts a 70@xmath14 occupancy of the three alpha s of the hoyle state being in identical 0s orbit .",
    "this was rightly qualified as an @xmath0 particle condensate .",
    "this interpretation of the hoyle state and the prediction that in heavier n@xmath0 nuclei similar @xmath0 condensates may exist , triggered an immense new interest in the hoyle state and @xmath0 cluster states around it .",
    "many experimental and theoretical articles have appeared since then including , e.g. , 5 review articles on the subject  @xcite . and the intensity of this type of studies does not seem to slow down . + for example very recently ab initio studies for cluster states appeared both using the nuclear effective - field - theory ( eft ) approaches @xcite and the symplectic no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite as we will discuss later in the main text .",
    "our article is organised as follows .",
    "in sect.2 we show how in infinite nuclear matter , below a certain low critical density , @xmath0 particle condensation appears . in sects . 3 - 7",
    ", we recapitulate in condensed form the most important theoretical methods to treat @xmath0 clustering in finite nuclei , that is the rgm , the ocm , the brink and generator coordinate method ( brink - gcm ) , the antisymmetrised molecular and fermion molecular dynamics ( amd , fmd ) , and finally the wave function proposed by tohsaki , horiuchi , schuck , rpke ( thsr ) . in sect .",
    "8 and 9 , the hoyle state in @xmath1c and its @xmath0 condensate structure is discussed employing the thsr wave function . in sect .",
    "10 the spacial extension of the hoyle state is investigated and in sect.11 excited hoyle states are studied . in sect .",
    "12 , we will present the recent attempts to describe clustering from ab initio approaches .",
    "in sect.13 we present an ocm study of the @xmath11 spectrum of @xmath2o with the finding that only the 6-th @xmath11 state at 15.1 mev can be interpreted as an @xmath0 cluster condensate state . in sect.14 ,",
    "a critical round up of the hypothesis of the hoyle state being an @xmath0 particle condensate is presented and the question asked : where do we stand after 15 years ? in sect.15 we show that also in the ground states of the lighter self conjugate nuclei non - negligeable correlations of the @xmath0 type exist which can act as seeds to break those nuclei into @xmath0 gas states when excited . in sect.16",
    "we treat the case what happens to the cluster states when an additional neutron is added to @xmath1c . in sect.17",
    "we discuss the experimental situation concerning @xmath0 condensation . in the next section 18",
    "we come back to cases where the @xmath0 is strongly present , even in the ground state .",
    "such is the case for @xmath4ne where two doubly magic nuclei ( @xmath2o and @xmath0 ) try to merge . in sect.19 , we point more in detail to the fact that the successful thsr description of cluster states sheds a new light on cluster dynamics being essentially non - localised in opposition to the old dumbell picture . then in sect.20",
    ", we come to another case of two merging doubly magic nuclei : @xmath15pb @xmath16 = @xmath5po . finally , in sect.21 , we give an outlook and conclude . +",
    "the possibility of quartet , i.e. , @xmath0 particle condensation in nuclear systems has only come to the forefront in recent years .",
    "first , this may be due to the fact that quartet condensation , i.e. , condensation of four tightly correlated fermions , is a technically much more difficult problem than is pairing .",
    "second , as we will see , the bec - bcs transition for quartets is very different from the pair case . as a matter of fact",
    "the analog to the weak coupling bcs like , long coherence length regime does not exist for quartets .",
    "rather , at higher densities the quartets dissolve and go over into two cooper pairs or a correlated four particle state .",
    "quartets are , of course , present in nuclear systems . in other fields of physics",
    "they are much rarer .",
    "one knows that two excitons ( bound states between an electron and a hole ) in semiconducters can form a bound state and the question has been asked in the past whether bi - excitons can condense  @xcite . in future cold atom devices , one may trap four different species of fermions which , with the help of feshbach resonances , could form quartets ( please remember that four different fermions are quite necessary to form quartets for pauli principle and , thus , energetic reasons )",
    ". theoretical models of condensed matter have already been treated and a quartet phase predicted  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "let us start the theoretical description .",
    "for this it is convenient to shortly repeat what is done in standard s - wave pairing . on the one hand",
    ", we have the equation for the order parameter @xmath17 where the brackets stand for expectation value in the bcs state and @xmath18 are fermion creation and destruction operators ( we suppose s - wave pairing and suppress the spin dependence ) @xmath19 with @xmath20 kinetic energy , eventually with a hartree - fock ( hf ) shift , and @xmath21 the matrix element of the force with @xmath22 c.o.m . and relative momenta .",
    "one recognises the in medium two - particle bethe - salpeter equation at @xmath23 , taken at the eigenvalue @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the chemical potential . inserting the standard bcs expression for the occupation numbers @xmath26 leads for pairs at rest , i.e. , @xmath27 , to the standard gap equation  @xcite .",
    "we want to proceed in an analogous way with the quartets . in obvious short hand notation where we comprise in one number index momentum and spin , the in - medium four fermion bethe - salpeter equation for the quartet order parameter @xmath28",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath29 we see that above equation is a rather straight forward extension of the pairing case to the quartet one .",
    "the difficulty lies in the problem how to find the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "occupation numbers @xmath30 in the quartet case .",
    "again , we will proceed in analogy to the pairing case .",
    "eliminating there the anomalous green s function from the @xmath31 set of gorkov equations @xcite leads to a mass operator in the dyson equation for the normal green s function of the form @xmath32 with the gap defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the time reversed state of @xmath35. its graphical representation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sogomassoperator ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "single particle mass operator in case of pairing ( upper panel ) and quartetting ( lower panel).,title=\"fig : \" ]   single particle mass operator in case of pairing ( upper panel ) and quartetting ( lower panel).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the case of quartets , the derivation of a s.p .",
    "mass operator is more tricky and we only want to give the final expression here ( for detailed derivation , see appendix a and ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath36\\delta^*_{1234}}{\\omega +    e_2+e_3+e_4 -4\\mu}\\ , , \\label{mquart}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the fermi step at zero temperature and the quartet gap matrix is given by @xmath39 this quartet mass operator is also depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sogomassoperator ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "though , as mentioned , the derivation is slightly intricate , the final result looks plausible .",
    "for instance , the three backward going fermion lines seen in the lower panel of fig .  [ fig : sogomassoperator ] give rise to the fermi occupation factors in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ mquart ] ) .",
    "this makes , as we will see , a strong difference with pairing , since there with only a single fermion line @xmath40 and , thus , no phase space factor appears .",
    "once we have the mass operator , the occupation numbers can be calculated via the standard procedure and the system of equations for the quartet order parameter is closed .",
    "numerically it is out of question that one solves this complicated nonlinear set of four - body equations brute force .",
    "luckily , there exists a very efficient and simplifying approximation .",
    "it is known in nuclear physics that , because of its strong binding , it is a good approximation to treat the @xmath0 particle in mean field as long as it is projected on good total momentum .",
    "we therefore make the ansatz ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a @xmath43 single particle wave function in momentum space .",
    "again the scalar spin - isospin singlet part of the wave function has been suppressed . with this ansatz which is an eigenstate of the total momentum operator with eigenvalue @xmath44 , the problem is still complicated but reduces to the selfconsistent determination of @xmath45 what is a tremendous simplification and renders the problem manageable .",
    "the reader should be aware of the fact that the approximation ( [ eq : alphaprojectedmf ] ) is not a simple mean field ansatz .",
    "it is projected on good total momentum what induces strong correlations on top of the product of s.p .",
    "wave functions .",
    "below , we will give an example where the high efficiency of the product ansatz is demonstrated .",
    "of course , with the mean field ansatz we can not use the bare nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "we took a separable one with two parameters ( strength and range ) which were adjusted to energy and radius of the free @xmath0 particle . in fig .",
    "[ sogofig6 ] ,        we show the evolution with increasing chemical potential @xmath25 ( density ) of the single particle wave function in position and momentum space ( two left columns ) .",
    "we see that at higher @xmath25 s , i.e. , densities , the wave function deviates more and more from a gaussian . at slightly positive @xmath25",
    "the system seems not to have a solution anymore and selfconsistency can not be achieved .",
    "very interesting is the evolution of the occupation numbers @xmath46 with @xmath25 ( density ) also shown in fig .",
    "[ sogofig6 ] ( right column ) .",
    "it is seen that at slightly positive @xmath25 where the system stops to find a solution , the occupation numbers are still far from unity .",
    "the highest occupation number one obtains lies at around @xmath47 .",
    "this is completely different from the bec - bcs cross - over in the case of pairing , where @xmath25 can vary from negative to positive values and the occupation numbers saturate at unity when @xmath25 goes well into the positive region , see fig.[occs - bcs ] .",
    "we therefore see that , in the case of quartetting , the system is still far from the regime of weak coupling and large coherence length when it stops to have a solution .",
    "one also sees from the extension of the wave functions that the size of the @xmath0 particles has barely increased .",
    "before we give an explanation for this behavior , let us study the critical temperature where this breakdown of the solution is seen more clearly .        in order to study the critical temperature for the onset of quartet condensation",
    ", we have to linearise the equation for the order parameter ( [ quartetorderparametereqn ] ) in replacing the correlated occupation numbers by the free fermi - dirac distributions at finite temperature @xmath48^{-1}$ ] with @xmath49 .",
    "determining the temperature @xmath50 where the equation is fullfilled gives the critical temperature @xmath51 .",
    "this is the thouless criterion for the critical temperature of pairing @xcite transposed to the quartet case . in fig .",
    "[ sogotc ] ,        we show the evolution of @xmath52 as a function of the chemical potential ( left panel ) and of density ( right panel ) @xcite , see also  @xcite for the case of asymmetric matter .",
    "this figure shows very explicitly the excellent performance of our momentum projected mean field ansatz for the quartet order parameter .",
    "the crosses correspond to the full solution of eq .",
    "( [ quartetorderparametereqn ] ) in the linearised finite temperature regime with the rather realistic malfliet - tjohn bare nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite whereas the continuous line corresponds to the projected mean field solution .",
    "both results are litterally on top of one another ( the full solution is only available for negative chemical potentials ) .",
    "a non - projected mean field wave function would never give such a good agreement .",
    "one clearly sees the breakdown of quartetting at small positive @xmath25 ( the fact that the critical @xmath53 breakdown occurs at a somewhat larger positive @xmath25 with respect to the full solution of the quartet gap equation with the ansatz ( [ eq : alphaprojectedmf ] ) at @xmath50=0 may be due to the fact that here we are at finite temperature , see also discussion below ) whereas n - p pairing ( in the deuteron channel ) continues smoothly into the large @xmath25 region .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the isospin polarised case with more neutrons than protons , n - p pairing is much more affected than quartetting ( due to the much stronger binding of the @xmath0 particle ) and finally loses against @xmath0 condensation @xcite .",
    "so , contrary to the pairing case , where there is a smooth cross - over from bec to bcs , in the case of quartetting the transition to the dissolution of the @xmath0 particles seems to occur quite abruptly and we have to seek for an explanation of this somewhat surprising difference between pairing and quartetting .",
    "the explanation is in a sense rather trivial .",
    "it has to do with the different level densities involved in the two systems . in the pairing case , the s.p .",
    "mass operator only contains a single fermion ( hole ) line propagator and the level density is given by    @xmath54    in the case of three fermions , as is the case of quartetting , we have for the corresponding level density ( see also @xcite ) @xmath55 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times     \\delta(\\omega + e_1 + e_2 + e_3)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig .

    "the interesting case is @xmath57 .",
    "we see that phase - space constraint and energy conservation can not be fullilled simultaneously at the fermi energy and the level density is zero there .",
    "this is just the point where quartetting should build up .",
    "obviously , if there is no level density , there can not be quartetting . in the case of pairing",
    "there is no phase space restriction and the level density is finite at the fermi energy . for negative @xmath25",
    ", @xmath58 vanishes at zero temperature and is exponentially small at finite @xmath50 .",
    "then there is no fundamental difference between 1@xmath56 and 3@xmath56 level densities .",
    "this explains the striking difference between pairing and quartetting in the weak coupling regime .",
    "the same reasoning holds in considering the in - medium four body equation ( [ quartetorderparametereqn ] ) .",
    "the relevant in - medium four - fermion level density is also zero at @xmath59 for @xmath57 even for the quartet at rest . actually",
    "the only case of an in - medium @xmath60-fermion level density which remains finite at the fermi energy is ( besides @xmath60 = 1 ) the @xmath61 case when the c.o.m .",
    "momentum of the pair is zero , as one may verify straightforwardly .",
    "that is why pairing is such a special case , different from condensation of all higher clusters .",
    "of course , the level densities do no longer pass through zero , if we are at finite temperature .",
    "only a strong depression may occur at the fermi energy .",
    "this is probably , as mentioned , the reason why the break down of the critical temperature is slightly less abrupt than at @xmath23 .",
    "a well known example of zero level density at the fermi energy may be familiar to the reader from fermi liquid theory where the infinite mean free path of a fermion at the fermi energy also is due to the fact that the 2p-1h level density ( entering fermi s golden rule ) passes through zero at the fermi energy .",
    "+ in conclusion of this nuclear matter section concerning quartet condensation , we can say that for sure @xmath0 particle condensation happens in low density nuclear matter .",
    "it may not be the only cluster which condenses because it is not the strongest bound even - even nucleus . in this context",
    ", the reader should always bare in mind that nuclei and nuclear sub - clusters only exist because there are four different fermions involved . in a dynamic process",
    ", the doubly magic @xmath0 particle probably will be the first nucleus which condenses because of its small number of particles and its strong binding .",
    "a phenomenon of this type may happen in compact stars , as e.g. , proto - neutron stars .",
    "also neutron stars which are not completely cooled down may have in the outer crust a neutron gas between the nuclei , forming a coulomb - lattice , with a good portion of protons .",
    "however , in which density , asymmetry , temperature range this may happen is an open question so far @xcite .",
    "whereas the composition of nuclear matter at low densities and low temperatures is well investigated to give a partial density of @xmath0 particles , correlation effects at higher densities may suppress the formation of a condensate .",
    "further studies should be undertaken to better constrain this kind of phenomenon .    at this point",
    ", we should also mention that in the preceding quartet gap equation we considered an uncorrelated fermi gas as background .",
    "in other words we treated a situation where four uncorrelated fermions directly collapse into the quartet order parameter .",
    "however , in nuclear physics with four different species of fermions , there may exist other processes leading to quartetting ( @xmath0 particle condensation ) .",
    "this stems from the fact that in a low density nuclear fermi gas , there may , besides free nucleons , also deuterons , tritons , helions be present . then two dimers and/or nucleons and trimers can form a quartet .",
    "such processes are shown in fig.[d - d ] .",
    "it remains as an important task for the future to treat a ( hot ) gas of nucleons , deuterons , tritons , helions , @xmath0 s simultaneously with respect to mutual pairing and quartetting properties .",
    "after all this , like with pairing , it is now very tempting to imagine that in finite nuclei precurser phenomena of @xmath0 particle condensation are present",
    ". this will be the subject of the following sections .",
    "in finite nuclei special techniques have to be and have been developed to treat clustering , for instance @xmath0 particle clustering .",
    "the rgm is one of the most powerful microscopic cluster approaches for finite nuclei .",
    "it has been introduced by wheeler  @xcite and used by kamimura _",
    "et al . _ in 1977 in his famous work  @xcite to explain the cluster structure of @xmath62 and , for instance , the hoyle state .",

    "the delta - functions in ( [ h - kernel ] ) only serve for an easy book keeping of the jacobi coordinates @xmath76 at the end of the calculation . in order to make out of ( [ rgm - eq ] ) a standard schrdinger equation",
    ", we have to take the square root of the norm kernel , introduce a renormalised wave function @xmath77 and divide @xmath78 from left and right by @xmath79 what leads to @xmath80 .",
    "of course the division is only possible if we beforehand had diagonalised the norm kernel and eliminated the configurations belonging to zero eigenvalues . in the reduced space",
    "the schrdinger equation then looks like @xmath81 since , for example in the case of two @xmath0 s @xmath82 the nucleons occupy @xmath43 orbits and in pure ho slater approximation 4@xmath83 quanta are occupied from the four nucleons in the @xmath84-shell , the relative wave functions must at least accommodate 4@xmath83 , if for overlapping configuration the slater determinant shall be recovered .",
    "states with occupation lower than 4@xmath83 are so - called pauli forbidden states .",
    "these pauli forbidden states give rise to zero eigenvalues in the norm kernel and are thus automatically eliminated within the rgm formalism . on the other hand , the fact that the relative wave function must not have ho quanta smaller than four implies that it develops nodes in the region of overlap of the two @xmath0 s . since nodes generate kinetic energy , the amplitudes of oscillations at short distances will be small .",
    "this is precisely what we will find below when we treat @xmath85 in more detail .",
    "the above considerations can obviously be extended to any number of @xmath0 particles",
    ". it should be mentioned , however , that the explicit evaluation of the antisymmetrisation is very complicated and the rgm equations have not been solved as they stand beyond the three @xmath0 particles @xmath86 case .",
    "+ on the other hand , let us mention that rgm in the ncsm has recently successfully been used in describing scattering and reactions in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "as we easily understand from eqs ( [ rgm ] ) and ( [ renorm - rgm ] ) , the procedure to integrate out the internal coordinates of the @xmath0 s leads to equations which are of bosonic type .",
    "it seems , therefore , natural to apply some further approximations to avoid the complexity with the antisymmetrisation .",
    "for example it can be shown that the eigenfunctions @xmath87 of the norm kernel which belong to the zero eigenvalues are just the pauli forbidden states we discussed above .",
    "they satisfy the condition @xmath88 for the case of @xmath89 particles .",
    "this means that the antisymmetrised rgm wave function where @xmath70 is replaced by the pauli forbidden @xmath90 s is exactly zero .",
    "this is a very strong boundary condition which is advised to incorporate into further approximation schemes .",
    "the idea of the ocm is , thus , the following : replace @xmath80 by an effective hamiltonian @xmath91 which contains effective phenomenological two and three body forces with adjustable parameters to mock up , e.g. , the repulsion when two @xmath0 particles come close @xmath92    the effective local 2@xmath0 and 3@xmath0 potentials are presented as @xmath93 ( including the coulomb potential ) and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "then , the equation of the relative motion of the @xmath95 particles with @xmath91 , called the ocm equation , is written as @xmath96\\phi^{(\\mbox{ocm})}_{n\\alpha}=0 \\label{ocm - eq}\\ ] ] @xmath97    where @xmath90 represents the pauli forbidden states as mentioned above .",
    "they have to be orthogonal to the physical states , a condition which is taken into account in ( [ ocm - cond ] ) .",

    "the brink wave function is in fact a perfect slater determinant where always quadruples of 2 protons and 2 neutrons are placed on the same spatial position @xmath103 .",
    "this can be seen in noticing that a product of four gaussians can be written as an intrinsic part @xmath104 times a c.o.m .",

    "the corresponding gcm wave function is a superposition of brink ones with a weight function @xmath105 which has to be determined from a variational calculation , @xmath106    it is clear that the gcm wave function is much richer than the single brink one .",
    "actually both wave functions , for practical use , have to be projected on good linear momentum ( @xmath107 ) and on good angular momentum . to take off of the brink wave function the total c.o.m .",

    "in 2007 the hoyle state was also newly calculated by the practioners of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) ( kanada - enyo _ et al . _",

    "no bosonic occupation numbers were calculated , see sect.9 .",
    "it seems technically difficult to do this with these types of wave functions .",
    "however , one can suspect that if occupation numbers were calculated , the results would not be very different from the thsr results .",
    "this stems from the high sensitivity of the inelastic form factor ( sect.10 ) to the employed wave function .",
    "nonetheless , it would be important to produce the occupation numbers also with amd and fmd .",
    "+ in @xcite some geometrical configurations of @xmath0 particles in the hoyle state are shown .",
    "no special configuration out of several is dominant .",
    "this reflects the fact that the hoyle state is not in a crystal - like @xmath0 configuration but rather forms to a large extent a bose condensate .",
    "in 2001 tohsaki , horiuchi , schuck , and rpke ( thsr ) proposed a new type of cluster wave function which has shed novel light on the dynamics of cluster , essentially @xmath0 cluster motion in nuclei  @xcite .",

    "it remains to be seen whether this aspect can present some advantages in future studies .",
    "+ from ( [ thsr - n ] ) , we see that the thsr wave function is analogous to a number projected bcs wave function in case of pairing and , therefore , suggests @xmath0 particle condensation . however , for a wave function with a fixed number of particles , a bosonic type of condensation is not guaranteed and it has to be shown explicitly in how much the condensation phenomenon is realized .",
    "we will come to this point later .",
    "the thsr wave function has two widths parameters @xmath123 and @xmath68 which are obtained from minimising the energy .",
    "the former describes the c.o.m .",

    "the width @xmath68 of the @xmath0 particles should be much smaller and essentially stay at its free space value @xmath124 fm .",
    "however , if one squeezes the nucleus , the @xmath0 s will strongly overlap and quickly loose their identity , getting larger in size and finally , at normal nuclear densities dissolve completely into a fermi gas .",
    "this happens for @xmath125 .",
    "the mechanism which leads to this fast dissolution of the @xmath0 particles was discussed in section 2 in the case of infinite matter .",
    "one can show that the thsr wave function contains two limits exactly .",
    "for @xmath125 it becomes a pure harmonic oscillator slater determinant  @xcite , whereas for @xmath126 the @xmath0 particles are so far apart from one another that the pauli principle , i.e. , the antisymmetriser , can be neglected leading to a pure product state of @xmath0 particles , i.e. , a condensate .",
    "these features of the thsr wave function show again the necessity to investigate to which end thsr is closer : to a slater determinant or to an @xmath0 particle condensate .",
    "we will study this in detail for the hoyle state of @xmath1c in the next section .",
    "+ for the moment , let us continue with our study of @xmath8be . of course , we know that @xmath8be is strongly deformed .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise the thsr wave function to deformed systems  @xcite .",

    "[ densities8be ] .",
    "we see that there is quite strong difference between the two distributions .",
    "the thsr one is much more diffuse than the one obtained from a single brink wave function .",
    "actually this physical crystal - like dumbbell picture was the prevailing opinion of cluster physics before the introduction of the thsr wave function .",
    "we see that thsr offers a much more smeared out , quantal aspect of clustering .",
    "we will elaborate on this in more detail in sect.19 where we discuss cluster localisation versus delocalisation. + one has to superpose many brink wave functions ( about 30 ) as done with the brink - gcm approach to recover the quality of the single thsr wave function . in the laboratory frame ,",
    "i.e. after angular momentum projection , the wave functions become almost identical  @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ 8be - wf ] . actually , it is interesting that the angular momentum projection can be performed in this case analytically . with ( [ i - proj ] )",

    "the results , e.g. , for the ground state energy , are identical up to the 4th digit with the results from rgm  @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite .    after this relatively simple but instructive case of @xmath8be ,",
    "let us move onward to @xmath1c .",
    "compared to the @xmath8be case , the situation in @xmath1c is considerably more complex .",

    "the reason why the hoyle state , in analogy to the case of @xmath8be is not the ground state of @xmath1c is not absolutely clear .",
    "however , one may speculate that some sort of extra attraction acts between the three @xmath0 s which makes the @xmath0 gas state collapse to a much denser state of the fermi gas type , that is to good approximation describable , as practically all other nuclei , by a slater determinant . in @xmath1c",
    "coexist , therefore , two types of quantum gases : fermionic ones and bosonic ones .",
    "we will see later that one can suppose that such is also the case in heavier self conjugate nuclei like @xmath2o , etc . + as already pointed out in the introduction , the hoyle state and other states in @xmath1c were explained in the 1970-ties by two pioneering works from kamimura _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and uegaki _ et al . _",
    "they used the rgm and brink - gcm approaches , respectively . in 2001 the thsr wave function explained the hoyle state with the @xmath0 condensate type of wave function ( [ thsr - n ] )  @xcite .",
    "it was shown later that , taken the same ingredients , the thsr wave function has almost 100@xmath14 squared overlap for the hoyle state with the wave function of kamimura _ et al . _ ( and by the same token also of uegaki _ et al . _ )  @xcite . before we come , however , to a detailed presentation of the results , we have to explain how to use the thsr wave function in the case where the @xmath0 gas state is not the ground state as in @xmath8be but an excited state .",
    "two possibilities exist .",
    "either one takes the large width parameter @xmath123 as hill - wheeler coordinate  @xcite and superposes a couple of thsr wave functions with different @xmath123-values leading to an eigenvalue equation which yields several eigen values including ground and hoyle state  @xcite , or one minimises the energy under the condition that the excited state is orthogonal to the ground state  @xcite .",
    "we will adopt the latter strategy because it has been shown , as already mentioned , that a _ single _ wave function of the thsr type is able to describe the hoyle state with very good accuracy . +    , together with the ground state @xmath137 .",

    "a more direct way of measuring the degree of quartet condensation is to calculate the single @xmath0 particle density matrix @xmath155 where from the density matrix formed with the fully translationally invariant thsr wave function all intrinsic @xmath0 coordinates as well as all @xmath0 c.o.m .",

    "probably the anomaly lies in the branching ratio of such events : if it is higher than predicted by hauser feshbach , this might be due to the reduced coulomb barrier associated to the large extent of the hoyle state ( as stated by von oertzen himself ) , which is probably the doorway state of the three @xmath0 s . a similar deviation from hauser - feshbach in the multiple @xmath0 channel",

    "it was also found that the hoyle state is to 80% an @xmath0 bose condensate @xcite .",
    "would the decay probability of the hoyle ( as well as of the 15.1 mev state ) be the same as if one neglected the bosonic aspect ?",
    "in other words , is the decay probability ( or tunnelling rate ) out of bose condensate influenced by the condensate , similar to what happens with pairing ?",
    "as just mentioned , only a realistic numerical investigation can give a final answer .",
    "anyway , this example shows that the decay of the 15.1 mev state into two @xmath8be s may be a very rewarding subject , experimentally as well as theoretically , in order to elucidate further its @xmath0 cluster structure .",
    "in section 2 . , we have treated the @xmath8be nucleus and have seen that the thsr wave function yields a very different picture of the intrinsic deformed two @xmath0 cluster state than the one from the traditional brink approach .",
    "though in both cases a clear two @xmath0 cluster structure is seen , the brink solution resembles the classical dumbbell picture of @xmath8be which was prevailing since the early days of cluster physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the thsr approach yields a much more diffuse quantal image of @xmath8be .",
    "we should be aware of the fact that it is in the intrinsic state where the physics lies .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen in sect.7 that brink - gcm and thsr give practically the same _ spherical _ density after angular momentum projection , that is in the laboratory frame . however , the intrinsic state is a superposition of many eigenstates of angular momentum and projection means to filter out of this wave packet the component which has the angular momentum of interest , that is @xmath268 of the ground state in our case .",

    "this may not be entirely surprising , since we have seen already in the introduction that mean field theory can reveal clustering .",
    "the only question is whether mean field correctly describes the cluster features . that @xmath4ne shows a @xmath2o @xmath269 cluster structure even in the ground state may be due to the fact that both , @xmath2o as well as @xmath157he are very stiff doubly magic nuclei .",

    "several times in this review , we alluded already to the fact that the physical picture of cluster motion delivered by the thsr ansatz is very different from the brink approach",
    ". let us elaborate somewhat more on this aspect .",
    "as already mentioned , it was and , may be , still is the prevailing opinion of the cluster community that clusters in nuclear systems are localised in space .",
    "this opinion stems from brink s ansatz for his cluster wave function ( see ( [ ne - hybrid ] ) for @xmath283 ) where , e.g. , the @xmath0 particle is explicitly placed at a definite position in space .",
    "even though , later , the fixed position is smeared in the brink - gcm approach , the picture of an essentially localised @xmath0 remained . in the thsr wave function , there is a priori absolutely no spacial localisation visible .",
    "the parameter @xmath123 which enters the thsr wave function is a quantal width parameter which makes the c.o.m .",
    "distribution , centered around the origin , of an @xmath0 particle wider or narrower .",
    "nevertheless , one sees localisation of @xmath0 particles as , e.g. , in @xmath8be or in @xmath4ne as seen in fig.[fig : alodens ] .",
    "this localisation can only come from the pauli principle , i.e. , the antisymmetriser @xmath64 in the thsr wave function .",
    "so localisation , like seen in @xmath8be is entirely an effect of kinematics , that is the @xmath0 s can not be on top of one another because of pauli repulsion . in an @xmath0 chain state , and @xmath8be is the smallest chain state , the @xmath0 s are , therefore , always quite well localised , see fig . 7 . in other spatial configurations of @xmath0 s like in the hoyle state ,",
    "the freedom of motion of the @xmath0 particles is much greater , in spite of the fact that they mutually avoid each other .",
    "the emerging picture of an @xmath0 gas state is then the following : the @xmath0 s freely move as bosons in a large container ( the mean field of the clusters ) but avoid to come too close to one another due to the pauli principle in spite of the fact that there is also some attraction between two @xmath0 s at not so close distance .",
    "this picture is well born out in an @xmath136 correlation function study of the hoyle state  @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar to the more phenomenological one of the excluded volume .",
    "the formation of @xmath0 particle - like clusters in nuclear systems and the description of its possible condensate properties is a challenge to present many - body theory . whereas in the case of two - nucleon correlations efficient approaches to describe pairing",
    "are known , no first - principle formalism is available at present to describe quartetting in heavy nuclei .",
    "the thsr approach may be considered as an important step in this direction but is restricted to light nuclei .",
    "a more general approach should also describe @xmath0-like clustering in arbitrary nuclear systems .",
    "an interesting example where the formation of @xmath0 particle - like clusters is relevant is radioactive decay by @xmath0 particle emission .",
    "the radioactive @xmath0 decay occurs , in particular , near the doubly magic nuclei @xmath272sn and @xmath15pb , and in superheavy nuclei .",
    "the standard approach to the decay width considers the transition probability for the @xmath0 decay as product of the preformation probability @xmath296 , a frequency factor , and an exponential factor .",
    "whereas the tunneling of an @xmath0 particle across the coulomb barrier is well described in quantum physics , the problem in understanding the @xmath0 decay within a microscopic approach is the preformation @xmath296 of the @xmath0 cluster in the decaying nucleus .    in the case of four nucleons moving in a nuclear environment ,",

    "we have seen that the @xmath0 condensate in this even - odd nucleus is only born out around the threshold energy for 3 @xmath0 s plus one neutron . at lower energies we identified cluster states with @xmath172he bound states due to the strong neutron-@xmath0 attraction . the study of analog states in @xmath1c + proton and cluster states of @xmath1c plus two nucleons may be an interesting subject for the future .",
    "first successful investigations of @xmath393c have already been performed @xcite employing a generalized thsr wave function .",
    "however , the more phenomenological ocm approach as applied here to @xmath3c also turns out to be very useful for the description of clustering .",
    "+ concerning the @xmath0 particle condensation aspect , we concluded that there are no serious objections which would invalidate this novel and exciting aspect of nuclear physics , in spite of the fact that direct proofs of condensation are difficult to obtain experimentally .",
    "analysis of heavy ion collisions ( hic s ) and relativistic coulomb excitations may be promising fields of future investigations both theoretically as well as experimentally .",
    "an interesting study in this respect may be the @xmath8be decay of the 6-th @xmath11 state at 15.1 mev in @xmath2o where one eventually may see an enhancement if the 15.1 mev state is an @xmath0 condensate state as predicted from our studies .",

    "confirmation of this fact would further give credit to the @xmath0 condensate and @xmath0 gas hypothesis for states around the @xmath0 disintegration threshold .",
    "the condensate states may be considered as the ground states on top of which @xmath0 particles may be lifted into higher nodal states . whether @xmath0 gas states can be deformed or not will need further studies , experimentally and theoretically . for this",

    "+ other time dependent cluster processes could qualitatively be studied with time - dependent thsr wave functions where the width parameters @xmath402 and @xmath403 are considered time - dependent .",
    "for example from a time - dependent variational principle @xmath404 , one could let start a compressed @xmath95 nucleus and follow its expansion as a function of time , that is its clusterisation into @xmath0 particles .",
    "this may give some qualitative insight into the dynamics of @xmath0 particle clustering when the nuclei reach a low density phase during their expansion .",
    "it may numerically within reach to perform such a study with the thsr wave function .",
    "+ the thsr approach also has shed a completely new light on the question of the spacial localisation of the alpha particles in states like @xmath8be or the hoyle state . since the much employed brink and brink - gcm wave function",
    "suggest a crystal arrangement of the @xmath0 s , a dumbbell picture for @xmath8be or an equilateral triangle for the hoyle state was in the past the common idea .",
    "however , the thsr wave function provides quite some other image of the situation .",
    "the @xmath0 particles move freely in their common cluster mean field potential , except for mutual overlaps which are prevented by the pauli principle .",
    "therefore , in linear chain states still some localisation can be seen , even with the thsr wave function , see fig.[densities8be ] , this being a purely kinematical effect .",
    "however , in essentially spherical condensates , as , e.g. , the hoyle state , localisation is much suppressed and the @xmath0 s most of their time ( over 70% ) move as free bosons , that is they perform a delocalised motion .",
    "the situation is actually not far from the old phenomenological idea of the excluded volume .",
    "this can nicely be seen with the @xmath136 correlation function in the hoyle state studied by suzuki _",
    "_ in @xcite . + it is tempting to try to treat in the future nucleons as clusters of three quarks with a similar thsr ansatz    @xmath405    with @xmath406 where @xmath407 is the intrinsic translationally invariant three quark wave function of the i - th nucleon",
    "of course , the nucleons form a fermi gas of three quark clusters , opposite to the case of @xmath0 s which are bosons .",
    "the antisymmetriser @xmath64 should take care of the fermionic aspect of the quark clusters .",
    "of course , this fermion - thsr approach is very hypothetical and much will depend on whether an effective quark - quark interaction can be modeled which describes well the nucleon - nucleon scattering data .",
    "this in analogy to the effective nucleon - nucleon force which was invented by tohsaki @xcite to successfully describe @xmath136 scattering data . for heavier nuclei where the thsr approach is inapplicable",
    ", one also could think of some fermionic ocm description which eases the solution of the many fermion systems .",
    "gases of trimers in atomic traps @xcite or triton and @xmath253he gases may be other fields of applications of ( [ thsr - fermi ] ) . + we also discussed and showed that the thsr wave function not only is well adopted for the description of condensate states .",
    "it also is apt to describe @xmath0-type of correlations in ground states .",
    "a paradigmatic case is @xmath4ne where two doubly magic nuclei quite unsuccessfully try to fuse completely . indeed in fig .",
    "33 we show the ground state density distribution of @xmath4ne where still a pronounced @xmath2o + @xmath0 structure can be seen .",
    "as well known , this left - right asymmetric shape gives raise to the so - called parity doublet rotational spectrum .",
    "it is quite remarkable that a _",
    "thsr wave function can account for the experimental situation .",
    "+ another case of binding of two doubly magic nuclei is @xmath5po = @xmath15pb + @xmath0 .",
    "this case is much more difficult to treat than @xmath4ne because of its high mass . indeed",
    "the thsr wave function which needs explicit antisymmetrisation could , so far , not handle nuclei beyond @xmath4ne because antisymmetrisation of heavy systems engenders very small differences of huge numbers , as is well known .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath5po , just because of its high mass , it actually shows also an advantage : the underlying core @xmath15pb can be considered as a fixed center , i.e. , recoil effects , still essential in @xmath4ne , can be neglected here .",
    "because of the compact size of the @xmath0 particle , barely larger than the surface thickness of @xmath15pb , we then calculated the effective @xmath15pb + @xmath0 potential with the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "a very genuine effect , revealed in our study of @xmath0 condensation in infinite matter , comes into play here .",
    "this concerns the fact that no bec to bcs like continuous cross - over exists for four fermion clusters , see sec.2 .",
    "therefore , when the @xmath0 particle is approaching the @xmath15pb core from the outside , it first , at very low density , feels the strong attraction from the usual fermionic mean field .",
    "however , very soon , still at very low density of about a 5-th of saturation density in the tail of the @xmath15pb density distribution the @xmath0 particle dissolves into 2 neutron-2 proton shell model states on top of the @xmath15pb core .",
    "thus , a potential pocket forms at the point where the @xmath0 dissolves revealing the preformation of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "this is contrary to what happens for example for a two fermion cluster on top of the @xmath15pb core .",
    "one could , for example , think of @xmath408bi with a deuteron as the cluster .",
    "the effective deuteron - pb potential should reveal a substantially different behavior from the @xmath0-pb case .",
    "of course , the lda has its limitations .",
    "however , since we have the quantal thsr solution for the analogue situation of @xmath4ne at hand , we can investigate the effective @xmath0-oxygen potential fully microscopically .",
    "again , one may study the difference with the deuteron + oxygen case of @xmath409f and see in how much this case is different from the @xmath0 cluster case .",
    "these very important and interesting studies remain for the future .",
    "+ in sec.12 , we also shortly discussed promising progress of ab initio approaches ( eft plus lattice qmc and symplectic ncsm ) to nuclear clustering .",
    "+ all in all , we feel that nuclear cluster physics will still make tremendous progress in the future .",
    "it may be a fore - runner of other cluster systems , like they are already produced with trimers in cold atoms or as one suspects to exist with bi - excitons in semi - conductors .",
    "other yet unexpected cluster problems may pop up in the future .",
    "let us try to set up a bcs analogous procedure for quartets .",
    "obviously we should write for the wave function      where the quartet amplitudes @xmath411 are fully antisymmetric ( symmetric ) with respect to an odd ( even ) permutation of the indices",
    ". the task will now be to find a killing operator for this quartet condensate state .",
    "whereas in the pairing case the partitioning of the pair operator into a linear combination of a fermion creator and a fermion destructor is unambiguous , in the quartet case there exist two ways to partition the quartet operator , that is into a single plus a triple or into two doubles . let us start with the superposition of a single and a triple . as a matter of fact it is easy to show that ( in the following , we always will assume that all amplitudes are real )          however , so far , we barely have gained anything , since above quartet destructor contains a non - linear fermion transformation which , a priory , can not be handled .",
    "therefore , let us try with a superposition of two fermion pair operators which is , in a way , the natural extension of the bogoliubov transformation in the pairing case , i.e. with @xmath414 $ ] where @xmath415 is a fermion pair creator .",
    "we will , however , find out that such an operator can not kill the quartet state of eq .",
    "( [ quartet - gs ] ) .",
    "in analogy to the so - called self - consistent rpa ( scrpa ) approach @xcite , we will introduce a slightly more general operator , that is          these relations are quite analogous to the ones which hold in the case of the scrpa approach @xcite .",
    "one also notices that the relation between @xmath421 amplitudes is similar in structure to the one of bcs theory for pairing . as with scrpa , in order to proceed , we have to approximate the additional @xmath422-term .",
    "the quite suggestive recipe is to replace in the @xmath422-term of eq .",
    "( [ pair - bogo ] ) the density operator @xmath423 by its mean value @xmath424 , i.e. @xmath425 where we supposed that we work in the basis where the single particle density matrix is diagonal , that is , it is given by the occupation probabilities @xmath30 .",
    "this approximation , of course , violates the pauli principle but , as it was found in applications of scrpa @xcite , we suppose that also here this violation will be quite mild ( of the order of a couple of percent ) . with this approximation , we see that the @xmath422-term only renormalises the @xmath426 amplitudes and , thus , the killing operator boils down to a linear super position of a fermion pair destructor with a pair creator .",
    "this can then be seen as a hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) transformation of fermion pair operators , i.e. , pairing of pairs. replacing the pair operators by ideal bosons as done in rpa , would lead to a standard bosonic hfb approach @xcite , ch.9 and appendix . here",
    ", however , we will stay with the fermionic description and elaborate an hfb theory for fermion pairs .",
    "for this , we will suppose that we can use the killing property @xmath419 even with the approximate @xmath427-operator .",
    "as with our experience from scrpa , we assume that this violation of consistency is weak .",
    "+ let us continue with elaborating our just defined frame .",
    "we will then use for the pair - killing operator      with ( the approximate ) property @xmath429 and the first relation in ( [ xyz - relations ] ) .",
    "the normalisation factor @xmath430 , i.e. , the quasi - pair state @xmath431 and the @xmath432 amplitudes being normalised to one .",
    "we now will minimise the following energy weighted sum rule            @xmath436\\rangle/(n^{1/2}_{k_1k_2}n^{1/2}_{k'_1k'_2})\\nonumber\\\\ & & = ( \\xi_{k_1 } + \\xi_{k_2})\\delta{k_1k_2,k'_1k'_2}\\nonumber \\\\ & &   + n^{-1/2}_{k_1k_2}n^{-1/2}_{k'_1k'_2 }   \\{n_{k_1k_2}\\bar v_{k_1k_2k'_1k'_2}n_{k'_1k'_2}\\nonumber\\\\   & & +   [ ( \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{k_1k'_1}\\bar v_{l_1k_2l_3l_4}c_{l_3l_4k'_2l_1}+\\bar v_{l_1k_2l_4k'_2}c_{l_4k_1l_1k'_1 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & -(k_1 \\leftrightarrow k_2 ) ] - [ k'_1 \\leftrightarrow k'_2 ] \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]          @xmath438\\rangle/(n^{1/2}_{k_1k_2}n^{1/2}_{k'_1k'_2})\\nonumber\\\\ & & = n^{-1/2}_{k_1k_2 } [ ( \\delta_{k_1k'_2;k'_1k_2 } - k_1 \\leftrightarrow k_2 ) - ( k'_1 \\leftrightarrow k'_2 ) ] n^{-1/2}_{k'_1k'_2 } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath439 in ( [ f - pair - gap ] ) the matrix multiplication is to be understood as @xmath440 for restricted summation ( or as @xmath441 for unrestricted summation ) .",
    "we see from ( [ b - matrix ] ) and ( [ a - gap ] ) that the bosonic gap @xmath442 involves the quartet order parameter quite in analogy to the usual gap field in the bcs case . the @xmath435 operator in ( [ f - pair - gap ] )",
    "has already been discussed in @xcite in connection with scrpa in the particle - particle channel .",
    "equation ( [ f - pair - gap ] ) has the typical structure of a bosonic hfb equation but , here , for fermion pairs , instead of bosons .",
    "it remains the task to close those hfb equations in expressing all expectation values involved in the @xmath435 and @xmath442 fields by the @xmath432 amplitudes .",
    "this goes in the following way .",
    "because of the hfb structure of ( [ f - pair - gap ] ) , the @xmath432 amplitudes obey the usual orthonormality relations , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can invert relation ( [ approxi - q ] ) to obtain      and by conjugation the expression for @xmath444 . with this relation",
    ", we can calculate all two body correlation functions in ( [ b - matrix ] ) and ( [ a - matrix ] ) in terms of @xmath432 amplitudes .",
    "this is achieved in commuting the destruction operators @xmath427 to the right hand side and use the killing property .",
    "for example , the quartet order parameter in the gap - field ( [ a - gap ] ) is obtained as @xmath445 . remains the task how to link the occupation numbers @xmath446 to the @xmath432 amplitudes .",
    "of course , that is where our partitioning of the quartet operator into singles and triples comes into play .",
    "therefore , let us try to work with the operator ( [ q - killer ] ) .",
    "first , as a side - remark , let us notice that if in ( [ q - killer ] ) we replace @xmath447 by its expectation value which is the pairing tensor , we are back to the standard bogoliubov transformation for pairing . here we want to consider quartetting and , thus , we have to keep the triple operator fully .",
    "minimising , as in ( [ pair - sum - rule ] ) an average single particle energy , we arrive at the following equation for the amplitudes @xmath448 in ( [ q - killer ] )          and @xmath452\\}\\rangle \\label{3body - h } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5 cm } { \\mathcal n}_{k_1k_2k_3;k'_1k'_2k'_3}=\\langle \\ { c^+_{k_3}c^+_{k_2}c^+_{k_1 } , c_{k'_1}c_{k'_2}c_{k'_3}\\}\\rangle \\label{3body - n } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath453 an anticommutator",

    "even this operator is still rather complicated for numerical applications and mostly one will replace the correlated occupation numbers by their free fermi- dirac steps , i.e. , @xmath456 . to this order the three body norm in ( [ 3body - n ] ) is given by @xmath457\\delta_{k_1k_2k_3,k'_1k'_2k'_3 } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath458 . in principle",
    "this effective three - body hamiltonian leads to three - body bound and scattering states . in our application",
    "to nuclear matter given below , we will make an even more drastic approximation and completely neglect the interaction term in the three - body hamiltonian .",
    "eliminating under this condition the @xmath459-amplitudes from ( [ sp - eq ] ) , one can write down the following effective single particle equation @xmath460 the occupation numbers are given by @xmath461    the effective single particle field in ( [ eff - sp - field ] ) is grapphically interpreted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sogomassoperator ] , lower panel . the gap - fields in ( [ eff - sp - field ] )",
    "are then to be calculated as in ( [ 13-gap ] ) and ( [ a - gap ] ) with ( [ inversion ] ) and the system of equations is fully closed .",
    "this is quite in parallel to the pairing case . in cases ,",
    "where the quartet consists out of four different fermions and in addition is rather strongly bound , as this will be the case for the @xmath0 particle in nuclear physics , one still can make a very good but drastic simplification : one writes the quartic order parameter as a translationally invariant product of four times the same single particle wave function in momentum space .",
    "we have seen , how this goes when we apply our theory to @xmath0 particle condensation in nuclear matter ( sect.2 ) . comparing the effective single particle field in ( [ eff - sp - field ] ) with the one of standard pairing  @xcite",
    ", we find strong analogies but also several structural differences .",
    "the most striking is that in the quartet case pauli factors figure in the numerator of ( [ eff - sp - field ] ) whereas this is not the case for pairing . in principle in the pairing case , they are also there , but since @xmath462 , they drop out .",
    "this difference has quite dramatic consequences between the pairing and the quartetting case .",
