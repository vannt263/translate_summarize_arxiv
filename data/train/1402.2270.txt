    "light - matter interactions in graphene , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb crystal of carbon atoms  @xcite , have been intensively explored in the past decade for both fundamental and applied purposes  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental advances have made it possible to monolithically integrate graphene with optical microcavities  @xcite , paving the way for fundamental studies of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite at the nanometer scale with graphene as an active medium .",
    "another approach , which has been successful  @xcite in achieving the so - called strong - coupling regime of cavity qed  @xcite in conventional 2d electron systems in semiconductor quantum wells , consists in coupling graphene carriers with the photonic modes of an array of split - ring resonators  @xcite .",
    "graphene - based cavity qed offers , at least in principle , a number of unique advantages .",
    "first , graphene is a highly - tunable active medium since its electrical and heat transport properties can be easily controlled by employing gates  @xcite .",
    "second , graphene offers many pathways to achieve the strong - coupling regime : these include i ) the exploitation of intrinsic dirac plasmons  @xcite and ii ) the combination of graphene with other plasmonic nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "third , the active medium can be enriched by employing 2d vertical heterostructures  @xcite comprising graphene as well as other 2d crystals / systems such as hexagonal boron nitride  @xcite , transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite ( e.g.  @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , gallium arsenide quantum wells  @xcite , etc .    a central role in cavity qed",
    "is played by the dicke model  @xcite , which describes a non - dissipative closed system of identical two - level subsystems interacting with a single - mode radiation field .",
    "for a sufficiently strong light - matter coupling constant , the thermodynamic limit of the dicke model exhibits a second - order quantum phase transition to a super - radiant state  @xcite with macroscopic photon occupation and coherent atomic polarization .    when an external magnetic field is applied to a 2d electron system ,",
    "transitions between states in full and empty landau levels ( lls ) are dispersionless  @xcite , mimicking atomic transitions and enabling  @xcite a condensed matter realization of the dicke model .",
    "the light - matter interaction in the dicke hamiltonian is linear in the vector potential @xmath3 of the cavity . for condensed matter states described by parabolic band models , a quadratic @xmath4 term",
    "whose strength is related to the system s drude weight and f - sum rule  @xcite , also emerges naturally from minimal coupling .",
    "it has long been understood  @xcite that the dicke model s super - radiant phase transition is suppressed when the quadratic terms are retained .",
    "demonstrations of this property are often referred to as _ no - go _ theorems .",
    "the problem is more subtle in graphene , where electronic states near the charge neutrality point are described in a wide range of energies by a 2d massless dirac fermion ( mdf ) hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the mdf hamiltonian contains only one power of momentum @xmath5 : minimal coupling applied to this hamiltonian does _ not _ generate a term proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the authors of ref .   demonstrated that , in the strong coupling regime , the model for the cavity qed of the graphene cyclotron resonance _ must _ be supplemented by a quadratic term in the cavity photon field that is dynamically generated by inter - band transitions and again implies a _ no - go _ theorem .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath4 in the theory of the cavity qed of the graphene cyclotron resonance were derived in ref .   by using as a guiding principle gauge invariance and by treating inter - band transitions in the framework of second - order perturbation theory .",
    "the main scope of this article is to lay down a formal theory of the cavity qed of the graphene cyclotron resonance .",
    "the key point is that one must derive a low - energy effective hamiltonian by taking into account the coupling of the two - level systems which are resonant with the cavity photon field to all non - resonant states .",
    "this coupling is crucially important in the strong - coupling regime , where all the terms that are proportional to @xmath4 , which are generated by our renormalization procedure , must be taken into account .",
    "indeed , these guarantee gauge invariance as well as a _ no - go _ theorem for the occurrence of a super - radiant phase transition , therefore corroborating the findings of ref .",
    "finally , we go beyond this generalized dicke description by demonstrating that it is not adequate to describe the strong - coupling regime of the cavity qed of the graphene cyclotron resonance in the limit of high doping . in this case",
    "we derive and discuss a renormalized hamiltonian for the entire stack of lls in conduction band , as dressed by the cavity electromagnetic field .",

    "<S> we present a theory of the cavity quantum electrodynamics of the graphene cyclotron resonance . by employing a canonical transformation , we derive an effective hamiltonian for the system comprised of two neighboring landau levels dressed by the cavity electromagnetic field ( integer quantum hall polaritons ) . </S>",
    "<S> this generalized dicke hamiltonian , which contains terms that are quadratic in the electromagnetic field and respects gauge invariance , is then used to calculate thermodynamic properties of the quantum hall polariton system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that the generalized dicke description fails when the graphene sheet is heavily doped , i.e.  when the landau level spectrum of 2d massless dirac fermions is approximately harmonic . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we `` integrate out '' </S>",
    "<S> the landau levels in valence band and obtain an effective hamiltonian for the entire stack of landau levels in conduction band , as dressed by strong light - matter interactions . </S>"
