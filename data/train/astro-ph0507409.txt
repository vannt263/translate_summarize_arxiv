    "the form of the spacetime geometry around an astrophysical black hole ( bh ) is due to roy kerr ( 1963 ) who found the exact solution to the general relativistic einstein s equations for the spacetime outside the horizon of a rotating bh . since then , rotating bh are known as kerr bh , the spacetime geometry of which depends on two parameters only , the bh mass and spin . in the limit of no rotation ,",
    "kerr s solution coincides with that for a non  rotating bh found earlier by karl schwarzschild ( 1916 ) , which obviously depends on the bh mass only .",
    "the complete solution of the equations of motion in the kerr spacetime is due to brandon carter ( 1968 ) .",
    "the interested reader finds an excellent treatment of einstein s theory of general relativity and of bh spacetimes in the fundamental book _ gravitation _ by misner , thorne & wheeler ( 1973 ) .",
    "a large fraction of the accretion energy in luminous bh systems is dissipated in the innermost regions of the accretion flow .",
    "most of the power is radiated from close to the smallest accretion disc radii in the relativistic region close to the bh ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; pringle 1981 ) .",
    "relativistic effects then affect the appearance of the x  ray spectrum from the disc through doppler , aberration , gravitational redshift and light bending effects ( page & thorne 1974 ; cunningham 1975 , 1976 ) .",
    "the dominant feature in the 210  kev x  ray spectrum seen by a distant observer is an iron line with a broad skewed profile which carries unique information on the structure , geometry , and dynamics of the accretion flow in the immediate vicinity of the central bh , providing a tool to investigate the nature of the spacetime there ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ; laor 1991 ) .",
    "relativistic broad iron lines seen in the spectrum of several active galaxies and galactic black hole binaries are reviewed here ( see also fabian et al 2000 ; reynolds & nowak 2003 for previous reviews ) . among others , the cases for relativistic lines in the seyfert galaxies mcg6 - 30 - 15 and iras  183255926 , and the x - ray binaries xte  j1650500 and gx339 - 4 are very strong ( tanaka et al 1995 ; wilms et al 2001 ; fabian et al 2002a ; iwasawa et al 1996a ; iwasawa et al 2004 ; miller et al 2002a ; miniutti ,",
    "fabian & miller 2004 ; miller et al 2004a , b ) . in three out of four objects ,",
    "the x  ray data require emission from within the innermost stable circular orbit of a non  rotating bh , suggesting that the bhs in many objects are rapidly spinning .",
    "the spectra of many other objects , in particular narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies , can be successfully described by a simple two  component model comprising a highly variable power law continuum and a much more constant reflection component from the accretion disc ( e.g.  fabian et al 2004 ; fabian et al 2005 ; ponti et al 2005 ) .",
    "the puzzling spectral variability of such sources is now beginning to be understood within the context of emission from the strong gravity regime ( miniutti et al 2003 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "some active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray black hole binaries show either no line or only a narrow one ( e.g.  page et al 2004 ; yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ) .",
    "this is discussed within the context of both theoretical implications and present observational limitations .",
    "finally , the short  timescale variability of the broad iron line is beginning to be unveiled , providing exciting results that are dramatically improving our understanding of the innermost regions of the accretion flow , where general relativity is no longer a small correction and becomes the most relevant physical ingredient ( e.g.turner et al 2002 ; iwasawa , miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "the advent of future x  ray missions with higher energy resolution ( e.g. _ suzaku _ succesfully launched in july 2005 ) and much larger collecting area in the relevant iron band ( xeus and constellation  x in the next decade ) will open up a new window on the innermost regions of the accretion flow in agn and x  ray binaries .",
    "this will enable us to further test the general picture we propose here , with the potential of mapping with great accuracy the strong field regime of general relativity in a manner which is still inaccessible at other wavelengths .",
    "radiatively - efficient accreting bhs are expected to be surrounded by a dense disc radiating quasi - blackbody thermal euv and soft x - ray emission ( see e.g the seminal paper by shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . however , the x  ray spectra of accreting bhs also exhibit a power law component extending to hard x  ray energies up to 200  kev or more .",
    "the most promising physical mechanism to produce such hard power law components is comptonization of the soft x ",
    "ray photons in a corona above the disc , possibly fed by magnetic fields from the body of the disc itself ( e.g.  haardt & marschi 1991 and 1993 , zdziarski et al 1994 ) .",
    "irradiation of the dense disc material by the hard x - rays then gives rise to a characteristic `` reflection '' spectrum which is the result of compton scattering and photoelectric absorption followed either by auger de - excitation or by fluorescent line emission ( see e.g.  guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 , matt , perola & piro 1991 ) .",
    "this last process gives rise to an emission line spectrum where fluorescent narrow k@xmath0 lines from the most abundant metals are seen .",
    "thanks to a combination of large cosmic abundance and high fluorescent yield , the iron ( fe ) k@xmath0 line at 6.4  kev is the most prominent fluorescent line in the x  ray reflection spectrum .",
    "photoelectric absorption is an energy ",
    "dependent process , so that incident soft x ",
    "rays are mostly absorbed , whereas hard photons tend to be compton scattered back out of the disc .",
    "however , above a few tens of kev , compton recoil reduces the backscattered photon flux and produces a broad hump  like structure around 2030  kev ( the so  called compton hump ) .",
    "an example of the x ",
    "ray reflection spectrum from a neutral and uniform density semi  infinite slab of gas is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ xrayspec ] where fluorescent emission lines dominate below about 8  kev and the compton hump is seen above 20  kev ( from reynolds 1996 ) .    in the case of agns ,",
    "the accretion disc is not the only reflector able to produce a x  ray reflection spectrum .",
    "the presence of a dusty molecular torus surrounding the accreting system is required by unification models at the parsec scale ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "the torus provides the absorbing column ( sometimes more than @xmath1  @xmath2 ) that is observed in seyfert 2 galaxies which are thought to be distinguished from unobscured seyfert 1 galaxies only because of a higher observer inclination .",
    "the torus itself is compton  thick and therefore provides an additional reflector producing a spectrum very similar to that seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ xrayspec ] .",
    "as will be explained in detail in the next section , special and general relativistic effects shape the reflection spectrum from the centre of the accretion disc and not that from regions far away from the central bh ( such as the torus ) , helping us to disentangle the two contributions .    in the right panel of fig  [ xrayspec ]",
    ", we show the main components of the x  ray spectrum of accreting black holes .",
    "the `` soft excess '' represents here the soft x  ray emission from the disc , although some other interpretations are possible and will be discussed throughout this contribution .",
    "we also show the power law ( with a high energy cut  off characteristic of the coronal temperature ) and reflection components .",
    "reflection is here represented by the reflection continuum ( characterised by the `` compton hump '' ) and the fe k@xmath0 line at 6.4  kev that we assume here to be narrow , i.e.  emitted from a distant reflector such as the torus .",
    "the spectrum is absorbed by a column of @xmath3  @xmath2 , representing the typical value for absorption by our galaxy in the line of sight .",
    "another important component in the x  ray spectrum of agn is due to the ubiquitous presence of warm gas surrounding the central nucleus .",
    "this gas is photoionized by the primary x ",
    "ray continuum and contributes to the spectrum both in absorption and in re  emission ( halpern 1984 ; reynolds 1997 ; kaastra et al 2000 ; kaspi et al 2001 ) . in the case of seyfert 1",
    "galaxies , the continuum level is so high that the emission component is diluted and generally not observable , except in particularly low flux states of the x  ray source .",
    "one remarkable case in this sense is provided by the low flux state of ngc  4051 ( see the analysis of the high resolution rgs data below 2  kev by pounds et al 2004b ; also ponti et al 2005 ) .    in seyfert 2",
    "galaxies , the primary continuum is heavily absorbed by large columns in the line of sight ( the torus ) and therefore the emission component is readily detectable .",
    "on the other hand , absorption by this same photoionized gas is obviously easier to detect in seyfert 1 than seyfert 2 galaxies due to the higher level of the continuum . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ wabs ] we show both absorption and emission components on a primary power law continuum ( plus cold absorption from our own galaxy in the direction of the source ) in the most relevant soft x  ray band .",
    "the gas is assumed to have a column of @xmath4  @xmath2 and ionization parameter of @xmath5  erg  cm  s@xmath6 and the spectrum is modelled with the xstar code ( kallman & krolik 1986 ) . in the right panel of the same figure",
    ", we show a qualitative view of the typical spectrum for a seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "the hard spectrum is dominated by reflection from the torus , whereas in the soft band emission lines from photoionized gas can be detected because of the low continuum level ( e.g.  kinkhabwala et al 2002 ; bianchi et al 2005 and many others ) . in the following",
    "we shall focus on unobscured accretion systems such as sefert 1 galaxies and bh binaries in which the innermost regions of the accretion flow are in principle observable .",
    "the fei k@xmath0 emission line is a doublet comprising k@xmath7 and k@xmath8 lines at 6.404  kev and 6.391  kev respectively .",
    "however , the energy separation has generally been too small to be detected and a weighted mean at 6.4  kev is generally assumed . the resulting line is symmetric and intrinsically much narrower than the spectral resolution commonly available today and k@xmath8 lines ] .",
    "hence , the detailed line shape and broadening can be used to study the dynamics of the emitting region .",
    "if the reflection spectrum , and therefore the fe line , originates from the accretion disc , the line shape is distorted by newtonian , special and general relativistic effects ( see e.g.  fabian et al 2000 ) .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] . in the newtonian case ,",
    "each radius on the disc produces a symmetric double  peaked line profile with the peaks corresponding to emission from the approaching ( blue ) and receding ( red ) sides of the disc .",
    "close to the bh , where orbital velocities become relativistic , relativistic beaming enhances the blue peak with respect to the red one , and the transverse doppler effect shifts the profile to lower energies . as we approach the central bh and",
    "gravity becomes strong enough , gravitational redshift becomes important with the effect that the overall line profile is shifted to lower energies .",
    "the disc inclination fixes the maximum energy at which the line can still be seen , mainly because of the angular dependence of relativistic beaming and of gravitational light bending effects . integrating over all radii on the accretion disc ,",
    "a broad and skewed line profile is produced , such as that shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ profiles ] .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that the detailed profile of a broad relativistic line from the accretion disc has the extraordinary potential of revealing the dynamics of the innermost accretion flow in accreting bhs and even of testing einstein s theory of general relativity in a manner that is unaccessible to other wavelengths .",
    "the relativistic line profile exhibits a dependence for many physical parameters .",
    "the energy of the blue peak of the line is mainly dictated by the inclination of the observer line of sight with respect to the accretion disc axis .",
    "this is clear in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ linedep ] where we show the result of fully relativistic computations ( e.g.  fabian et al 1989 ; laor 1991 ; doviak , karas & yaqoob 2004 among many others ) .",
    "the three profiles have all the same parameters but different observer inclination @xmath9 . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that the higher the inclination the bluer the line is , providing a quite robust tool to measure the inclination of the accretion disc .",
    "another important parameter is the form of the emissivity profile , i.e.  the efficiency with which the line is emitted as a function of the radial position on the disc .",
    "this depends mainly on the illumination profile by the hard x ",
    "rays from the corona which is in turn determined by the energy dissipation on the disc and by the heating events in the corona ( possibly associated with magnetic fields see e.g.  merloni & fabian 2001a , b ) .",
    "the emissivity profile is generally assumed to be in the form of a simple power law @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the emissivity index ( but see e.g.beckwith & done 2004 ) . by assuming that the emissivity is a good tracer of the energy dissipation on the disc , the standard value for the emissivity index is @xmath12 ( e.g.   pringle 1981 ;",
    "also reynolds & nowak 2003 and merloni & fabian 2003 for a discussion on the dependence of the emissivity profile on boundary conditions ) . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ linedep ] , we show the dependence of the line profile from this most important parameter .",
    "we show the cases of a uniform ( @xmath13 ) , standard ( @xmath12 ) , and steep ( @xmath14 ) emissivity profile .",
    "a steep emissivity profile indicates that the conversion of the x ",
    "ray photons from soft to hard in the corona is centrally concentrated thereby illuminating more efficiently the very inner regions of the accretion disc . as shown in the figure ,",
    "steeper emissivity profiles produce much broader and redshifted lines because more weight is given to the innermost disc , where gravitational redshift dominates .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the disc ( or to be more precise its outer layers ) is a slab of uniform density gas where hydrogen and helium are fully ionized , but all the metals are neutral .",
    "the real situation is likely to be much more complex .",
    "one first important step towards the accurate model of accretion disc atmospheres is made by considering thermal and ionization equilibrium .",
    "results of such computations have been published over the last ten years or so with different degrees of complexity ( e.g.  ross & fabian 1993 ; matt , fabian & ross 1993 , 1996 ; zycki et al 1994 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ; rzaska et al 2002 ; dumont et al 2003 ) .",
    "see ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 for a comparison between different hypothesis such as constant ",
    "density atmospheres and atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the recent work by ross & fabian ( 2005 ) extending and improving previous computations ( e.g.  ross , fabian & young 1999 ; ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 ) is described here in some detail since it is used extensively in comparing x  ray data to theoretical models .",
    "the illuminating radiation is assumed to have an exponential cut  off power law form with high  energy cut  off fixed at 300  kev and variable photon index @xmath15 between 1 and 3 roughly covering the observed range .",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath16 is defined as the ratio between the isotropic total illuminating flux and the comoving hydrogen number density of the gas ; results are produced for @xmath16 ranging from @xmath17  erg  cm  s@xmath6 to @xmath18  erg  cm  s@xmath6 .",
    "the local temperature and fractional ionization of the gas are computed self ",
    "consistently by solving the equations of thermal and ionization equilibrium and ions from c ,",
    "n , o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe are treated .",
    "the available model grids allow for a variable fe abundance .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ reflion ] we show x  ray reflection spectra produced by the code for three different values of the ionization parameter ( all other parameters being fixed ) .",
    "the ionization parameter has clearly a large effect on the resulting spectrum , most remarkably on the emission lines . for @xmath19  erg  cm  s@xmath6 ( top black )",
    "the surface layer is very highly ionized and the only noticeable line is a highly compton  broadened fe k@xmath0 line peaking at 7  kev .",
    "the overall spectral shape closely resembles that of the illuminating continuum ( a cut  off power law with photon index @xmath20 ) .",
    "for @xmath21  erg  cm  s@xmath6 ( middle blue ) the strong fe k@xmath0 line is dominated by the fe   intercombination line , while k@xmath0 lines from the lighter elements emerge in the 0.3 - 3  kev band . further reducing the ionization parameter to @xmath22  erg  cm",
    "s@xmath6 gives rise to a spectrum dominated by emission features below 3  kev atop a deep absorption trough .",
    "the most prominent feature is the fe k@xmath0 one at 6.4  kev .",
    "no residual compton broadening of the emission lines is visible .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ reflion ] we show two versions of a model with an ionization parameter of @xmath23  erg  cm  s@xmath6 .",
    "the blue one is the x ",
    "ray reflection spectrum in the absence of any relativistic effect , whereas in red we show the relativistically  blurred version of the same model , i.e.  the spectrum that is observed if reflection occurs from the accretion disc .",
    "all sharp spectral features of the unblurred spectrum ( blue ) are broadened by the relativistic effects explained above which makes it difficult to identify clear emission lines in the soft spectrum .",
    "below about 2  kev the situation is often complicated by the presence of absorption / emission features due to photoionized gas complicating the soft part of the spectrum ( see fig .  [ wabs ] , left panel ) .",
    "thanks to its strength , isolation , and to the fact that it occupies a region of the x  ray spectrum relatively free from absorption , the fe line is however clearly seen .",
    "this is what makes this particular emission feature a remarkable and unique tool that allows us to investigate the dynamics of the innermost accretion flow via relativistic effects in accreting bh systems .",
    "einstein s equations imply the existence of an innermost radius within which the circular orbit of a test particle in the equatorial plane is no longer stable .",
    "this radius is known as the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , sometimes referred to as the marginally stable orbit ( bardeen , press & teukolsky 1972 ) . beyond the isco",
    ", test particles rapidly plunge into the bh on nearly geodesic orbits with constant energy and angular momentum . by making the standard assumption that the accretion disc is made of gas particles in circular , or nearly circular , orbital motion ,",
    "the disc extends down to the isco , and emission from the plunging region is ignored .",
    "we shall discuss further this assumption in the next section .",
    "the actual radius of the isco depends on the bh spin parameter @xmath24 which can take any value for @xmath25 ( schwarzschild bh ) to @xmath17 ( maximally spinning kerr bh ) . as pointed out by thorne ( 1974 ) , the maximal value for the spin parameter is likely to be about @xmath26 and we shall refer to that case as `` maximal kerr '' .",
    "the dependence of the isco from the bh spin parameter is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ risco ] .",
    "the isco lies at @xmath27 from the centre for a schwarzschild bh , and at @xmath28 for a maximal kerr one , where @xmath29 is the gravitational radius .",
    "it should be stressed that the dependence is quite steep .",
    "if emission from say @xmath30 can be detected the implied bh spin would be @xmath31 .",
    "notice that accretion naturally causes a bh to spin up provided the disc angular momentum is oriented as that of the hole ( the possible history of the spin of massive bhs is discussed e.g.  by volonteri et al 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the inner boundary of the accretion disc , i.e.  the location of the isco , has a large impact on the shape of the line profile , especially on its broad red wing .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ risco ] where the cases of a schwarzschild ( red ) and maximal kerr bh ( blue ) are computed .",
    "the line is much broader in the kerr case because the smaller inner disc radius implies that the line photons are suffering stronger relativistic effects ( such as gravitational redshift ) which is visible in the resulting line profile .",
    "to summarise , the detection and modelling of a relativistic broad fe line via x  ray observations of accreting bh",
    "potentially provides crucial information on the system inclination , the radial efficiency of the coronal hard x  ray emission , and also on one of the two parameters that characterise the kerr solution , i.e.  the bh spin .",
    "a key issue in using the profile of a broad iron line to determine bh spin is whether the derived inner radius equals the isco , or not .",
    "reynolds & begelman ( 1997 ) pointed out that matter in the plunge region within the isco can also contribute to reflection and so could confuse spin determination .",
    "the matter in the plunge region is however moving inward rapidly and so has a low density .",
    "this means that the ionization parameter is high , which changes the ability to produce a detectable iron line .",
    "young , ross & fabian ( 1998 ) showed in the key case of mcg6 - 30 - 15 that the emission ( and absorption ) produced by reflection in the plunge region does not resemble the observed line shape .",
    "the issue of matter falling within the isco was further considered by gammie ( 1999 ) and krolik ( 1999 ) ; see also agol & krolik ( 2000 ) with the inclusion of magnetic fields which can connect the outer part of the plunge region with the disc and slow matter down ( also krolik & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "in fact , doviak , karas & yaqoob ( 2004 ) have shown that the difference in the flow direction has a negligible effect on the profile shape .",
    "we suspect that the effect of magnetic fields on the iron - line appearance is small .",
    "the ionization parameter can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the volume filling factor of the flow which is falling radially inward at velocity @xmath34 ( fabian & miniutti , in preparation ) . since @xmath33 and @xmath34 are unlikely to be much smaller than 0.1 over most of the plunge region , it is most unlikely that a strong iron line , requiring @xmath35@xmath36  erg  cm  s@xmath6 , can be produced .",
    "we suspect that the inner radius determined from iron line studies can not originate from far within the isco and that the inner disc radius @xmath37 is never more than one @xmath38 or so within the isco .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the bright seyfert 1 galaxy  ( @xmath39 ) has a broad emission feature stretching from below 4  kev to about 7  kev .",
    "the shape of this feature , first clearly resolved with by tanaka ( 1995 ) , is skewed and peaks at about 6.4  kev .",
    "this profile is consistent with that predicted from iron fluorescence from an accretion disc inclined at 30  deg extending down to within about 6 gravitational radii ( @xmath40 ) of a bh . during the  observation the line appeared to be occasionally redshifted to lower energies , implying emission from even smaller radii and therefore strongly suggesting that the bh in this object is rapidly spinning ( iwasawa et al 1996b ) .",

    "if this is emitted from far the bh ( such as from the torus ) , it has to be narrow and unresolved at the  resolution ( about 100  ev ) .",
    "however , the line core itself is unambiguously resolved by .",
    "when modelled by a gaussian emission line , the line core width is @xmath57  ev , much larger than the spectral resolution ( vaughan & fabian 2004 ) . considering a blend of lines from different fe ionization states as responsible for the broadening produces an unacceptable fit",
    "therefore , even ignoring for a moment the broad red wing of the line , the relatively narrow line core itself already suggest that the line is emitted in a fast orbiting medium close to the central bh and excludes any strong contribution from a reflector located at the parsec ( and even sub  parsec ) scale such as the torus and/or the broad line region .",
    "a small contribution is possible and likely , but at the level of 15 per cent maximum of the line core .    as for the broad red wing of the line below 6  kev",
    "( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ mcgline ] ) several attempts have been made to explain the spectral shape without invoking relativistic effects .",
    "the broad red wing of the line has been modelled by different emission components , i.e.  a thermal component , a blend of broadened emission lines ( other than fe ) , and complex absorption . in the latter model , which is probably the only serious one",
    ", the continuum passes through a large column of moderately ionized gas which can cause significant curvature above the fe  l edge ( about 0.7  kev ) up to about 56  kev , therefore with the potential of reproducing the broad red wing of the line",
    ". the gas must be sufficiently highly ionized to avoid undetected excessive opacity in the soft band , but not so highly ionized to lose of all its l  shell electrons .",
    "fit ionized absorption model to both  and  data can reproduce the red wing of the line ( though the fit statistic is much worse than when the data are fitted with a relativistic line ) .",

    "an ionized partial covering model can not be simply ruled out , but  data constrain the covering fraction to be less than 5 per cent , insufficient to produce enough spectral curvature in the relevant energy band , therefore requiring the presence of a broad relativistic line as for the neutral partial covering model above . as discussed in the next section ,",
    "the presence of complex absorption above 3  kev is also strongly ( and in our opinion , unambiguously ) ruled out by spectral variability analysis .",
    "the x - ray continuum emission of  is highly variable ( see vaughan , fabian & nandra 2003 ; vaughan & fabian 2004 ; reynolds et al .  2004 ; mchardy et al 2005 for some recent analyses ) as is also clear from the light curve in fig .",

    "several different methods are used to explore the spectral x  ray variability in accreting bh sources .",

    "any component that remained constant within the two flux levels is effectively removed from the spectrum which therefore carries information on the variable components plus absorption only .",
    "the  2001 observation was split into 2 different flux states according to the light curve ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ mcgline ] ) and two spectra were extracted as representative of the high and low flux states . the low flux spectrum was then subtracted from the high flux one .    in the right panel of fig .",

    "pn data are shown in the upper panel , while the high resolution rgs gratings are plotted in the middle and lower panels .",
    "it is clear from the figure , that the variable component is very well described by the power law in the 310  kev band and is affected by absorption from photoionized gas only below 3  kev .",
    "this demonstrates in a model  independent way that the x  ray variability in  is due to a relatively steep ( @xmath59 ) power law component , and that the amplitude changes of the continuum in  are due to this power law .",
    "the difference spectrum also clarifies in a model  independent way that there is no subtle additional absorption above 3  kev that might influence the broad red wing of the relativistic fe line .",
    "absorption by either neutral or ionized gas has to show up in the difference spectrum ( as seen below 3  kev ) but is not detected in the fe band above 3  kev .",
    "this is in our opinion conclusive on the reality of the broad red wing of the fe line .",
    "the case for the relativistic fe line in  therefore looks even more robust now than before .    it should be stressed that the difference spectrum , unlike the true spectrum of the source , does not exhibit any emission feature ( neither narrow nor broad ) in the fe band .",
    "this implies that the relativistic fe line in  is much less variable than the power law continuum and has therefore been removed by the subtraction . as a test",
    ", the 2001 exposure was divided into 10  ks long chunks and spectral fits performed . direct spectral analysis on",
    "the 10  ks spectra confirms that the variability in  closely follows a two  component model comprising a power law component ( hereafter plc ) with constant slope of about @xmath60 and highly variable normalization ( a factor 34 ) and a reflection  dominated component ( rdc ) that carries the broad fe line and whose variability is confined within 25 per cent ( fabian & vaughan 2003 ; vaughan & fabian 2004 ) confirming previous results ( shih , iwasawa & fabian 2002 ; matsumoto et al 2003 ) .    a further powerful model  independent tool to explore the spectral variability is provided by flux  flux plot analysis which consists of plotting the count rates in two different energy bands against each other ( taylor , uttley & mchardy 2003 ) .",
    "the largest variability in  occurs in the 12  kev band which is therefore chosen as the reference energy band . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ mcgff ] we show the count rates in the 310  kev band plotted against the simultaneous count rates in the 12  kev band ( from vaughan & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "black points refer to the 2001 long  observation , red ones to the previous shorter  observation in 2000 ( wilms et al 2001 ) .",
    "the figure is divided into two panels , the lower one being simply a binned version .",
    "it is clear that a very significant correlation is found in both observations .",
    "the scatter in the unbinned version is a manifestation of the different shape of the power spectral density in the two bands and lack of coherence .",
    "the scatter is removed in the binned version which is most useful for fitting purposes .",
    "the relationship is clearly linear which is an unambiguous sign that the variability in both bands is dominated by a spectral component which has the same spectral shape and varies in normalization only .",
    "however , extrapolating the linear relation to low count rates leaves a clear offset on the y  axis .",
    "this strongly suggests the presence of a second component that varies very little and contributes more to the 310  kev than to the 12  kev band . in other words ,",
    "the flux in each band is the sum of a variable and a constant component , with the constant component contributing more to the harder than softer energies . from the previous discussion on the difference spectrum ,",
    "the variable component is easily identified with a power law with constant slope @xmath60 dominating the variability by variation in normalization only .",
    "moreover , we already know that the reflection component varies little because no fe line is seen in the difference spectrum and because of the result of direct time  resolved spectral analysis .",
    "it is therefore likely that the constant component is associated with the x ",
    "ray reflection spectrum , including the relativistic fe line .",
    "flux plots can be produced for any chosen band by plotting the relative count rates as a function of those in the reference band .",
    "each plot will produce a different y  axis offset which represents the fractional contribution of the constant component to the spectrum in that particular energy band .",
    "therefore , by recording the value of the offset in each band , the `` fractional spectrum '' of the constant component can be obtained and the hypothesis that this is similar to a x  ray reflection spectrum can be tested .",
    "the fractional spectrum of the constant component is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mcgff ] ( from vaughan & fabian 2004 ; see taylor , uttley & mchardy for an similar result based on  data ) .",
    "the black circles are the result obtained by assuming that the contribution of the constant component in the 11.5  kev band is null , the arrows indicate the upper limits ( notice that the shape , which is the relevant here , does not change ) .",
    "the fractional spectrum is soft below @xmath61  1  kev and hard at higher energies with a strong contribution at 6.4  kev .",
    "this strongly resembles a typical x  ray reflection spectrum , supporting our previous hypothesis that the constant component in  is indeed reflection  dominated .      if the observed power law component ( plc ) continuum drives the iron fluorescence then the line flux should respond to variations in the incident continuum on timescales comparable to the light - crossing , or hydrodynamical time of the inner accretion disc ( fabian et al 1989 ; stella 1990 ; matt & perola 1992 ; reynolds et al .  1999 ) .",
    "this timescale ( @xmath62  s for reflection from within @xmath63 around a black hole of mass @xmath64  ) is short enough that a single , long observation spans many light - crossing times .",
    "this has motivated observational efforts to find variations in the line flux ( e.g.   iwasawa 1996b , 1999 ; reynolds 2000 ; vaughan & edelson 2001 ; shih , iwasawa & fabian 2002 ; matsumoto et al 2003 ) .",
    "however , the variability analysis discussed above implies that the reflection  dominated component ( rdc ) does not follows in general the plc variations .    explaining the relatively small variability of the rdc , compared with that of the plc , provides a significant challenge .",
    "the rdc and plc appear partially disconnected . since however both show the effects of the warm absorber they must originate in a similar location .",
    "as the extensive red wing of the iron line in the rdc indicates emission peaking at only a few gravitational radii ( @xmath65 ) we must assume that this is indeed where that component originates .",
    "on the other hand , this is also the region where most of the accretion power is dissipated and therefore the plc must originate in the corona above the innermost disc as well , so that light  travel  time effects can not be invoked to explain the lack of response of the rdc to the plc variation .",
    "we have developed a model for the variability of the plc and rdc components in accreting bh systems which is based on the idea that since both components originate in the immediate vicinity of the bh , they both suffer relativistic effects due to strong gravity ( fabian & vaughan 2003 ; miniutti et al 2003 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "some of the effects of the strong gravitational field on the line shape and intensity had already been explored by martocchia , matt & karas ( 2000 ) and dabrowski & lasenby ( 2001 ) .",
    "we assume a geometry in which a maximal kerr bh is surrounded by the accretion disc extending down to the isco .",
    "the plc is emitted from a primary source above the accretion disc .",
    "its location is defined by its radial distance from the bh axis and its height ( h ) above the accretion disc .",
    "several geometries have been studied and the results we present are qualitatively maintained for any source location and geometry within the innermost 45 gravitational radii from the black hole axis .",
    "the main parameter in our model is the height of the primary source above the accretion disc and the main requirement is for the source to be compact .",
    "the primary plc source could be physically realised by flares related to magnetic reconnection in the inner corona , emission from the base of a jet close to the bh , internal shocks in aborted jets , dissipation of the rotational bh energy via magnetic processes , etc .",
    "any mechanism producing a compact plc  emitting region above the innermost region of the accretion flow would be relevant for our model ( e.g.  blandford & znajek 1977 ; markoff , falcke & fender 2001 ; li 2003 ; ghisellini , haardt & matt 2004 and many others ) .",
    "a fraction of the radiation emitted by the primary source directly reaches the observer at infinity and constitutes the direct continuum which is observed as the plc of the spectrum .",
    "the remaining radiation illuminates the accretion disc ( or is lost into the hole event horizon ) .",
    "the radiation that illuminates the disc is reprocessed into the rdc . for simplicity , we assume that the intrinsic luminosity of the primary source is constant .",
    "the basic idea is that the relevant parameter for the variability of both the plc and the illuminating continuum on the disc ( which drives the rdc variability ) is the height of the primary source above the accretion disc and that the variability is driven by general relativistic effects the most important of which is gravitational light bending .    as an example , if the source height is small ( of the order of few gravitational radii ) a large fraction of the emitted photons is bent towards the disc by the strong gravitational field of the bh enhancing the illuminating continuum and strongly reducing the plc at infinity , so that the spectrum is reflection  dominated .",
    "if the source height increases , gravitational light bending is reduced so that the observed plc increases . finally , if the height is very large so that light bending has little effect , the standard picture of reflection models with approximately half of the emitted photons being intercepted by the disc and the remaining half reaching the observer as the plc is recovered .    with this setup , we compute the plc and fe line flux ( representative of the whole rdc ) as a function of the primary source height above the disc ( see miniutti et al 2003 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 for more details ) .",
    "our results are presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ lbending ] for the case of an accretion disc seen at an inclination of @xmath66 ( the relevant case for ) .",
    "the black dots indicate different values for the source height ( @xmath67 from left to right ) .",
    "what the figure shows is that , once general relativistic effects are properly accounted for , the broad fe line ( and rdc ) is not expected to respond simply to the observed plc variation anymore .",
    "three regimes can be identified ( i , ii , and iii in the figure ) .",
    "a correlation is seen only in regime i , where the primary source height is between about @xmath17 and @xmath68@xmath69 .",
    "on the other hand , if the primary source has a height between about @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( regime ii ) the broad fe line ( and rdc ) variability is confined within 10 per cent only , while the plc can vary by a factor @xmath61  4 .",
    "we recall here that the observed variability of the rdc in the 2001  observation is confined within 25 per cent despite variations by a factor 34 in the plc .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ lbending ] we show the value of the reflection fraction predicted by the model as a function of the source height .",
    "when the source height is large , the standard value @xmath46 is recovered .",
    "however , as the height decreases , light bending comes into play increasing the number of photons bent towards the disc while simultaneously reducing the number of those able to escape from the gravitational attraction .",
    "thus , the reflection fraction increases dramatically .",
    "two cases are shown in the figure , one for a source on the disc axis ( solid ) , one for a ring  like configuration at @xmath71 from the black hole axis .",
    "regime ii , which seems most relevant so far , is characterised by @xmath72 .",
    "quite remarkably this is precisely the measured value in  during the simultaneous ",
    "2001 observation we are discussing here .    thus , if our model is qualitatively correct , it implies that  was observed in regime ii by  during the 2001 observation with most of the accretion power being dissipated within @xmath73 in radius and in the range @xmath74@xmath70 in height above the disc .",
    "this is itself a remarkable result implying that we are looking down to the region of spacetime where general relativity exhibits itself at its best .",
    "since the model computes self  consistently the disc illumination , the emissivity profile can be computed . in regime ii",
    ", it turns out to be best described by a broken power law , very steep in the innermost region of the disc and flattening outwards , as observed in  ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ lbending2 ] ) .",
    "we computed fully relativistic line profiles with our model and compared them with the data ( fig .",
    "[ lbending2 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the line profiles obtained from regime ii provide a very good match to the  data ( miniutti et al 2003 ) .    as is clear from fig .",
    "[ lbending ] ( left panel ) , the model predicts a correlation between rdc and plc at low flux levels .",
    "fortunately , the  2000 observation ( that we did not discuss so far ) caught  in a slightly lower flux state than the 2001 one .",
    "the flux state is not remarkably lower , but some indications of the general behaviour can still be inferred .",
    "the details of the spectral analysis of the 2000 observation can be found in wilms et al ( 2001 ) and reynolds et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "here we only focus on the variability of the two components .",
    "if the source did not change dramatically its properties between the two observations , we should observe a somewhat correlated variability between the rdc and the plc . a comparison between the two observations in this sense is shown in fig .  [ 00and01 ] where results of spectral analysis performed on 10  ks chunks for both observations are presented .",
    "in the right panel , the plc slope @xmath15 and rdc normalization are shown as a function of the plc normalization for the higher flux 2001  observation .",
    "the relevant panel is the bottom one showing the constancy of the rdc despite the large plc variation . in the right panel of the same figure",
    ", we show the rdc vs. plc normalization for the lower flux 2000  observation .",
    "as already reported by reynolds et al ( 2004 ) , a clear correlation is seen between the two components in this lower flux observation .",
    "this result was not known yet when the light bending model was being developed and provides unexpected support for the overall picture , matching one of the main predictions of the model .",
    "the puzzling variability of the rdc and plc , the large value of the reflection fraction , and even the emissivity and line profiles all seem to indicate the relevance of the light bending model for . given the very strong case for fe line emission from the relativistic region in",
    ", it would be a rather surprising coincidence if strong relativistic effects were not responsible for some , if not all , of the behaviour discussed above .",
    "we conclude by stressing that in all cases in which broad fe lines are detected strong relativistic effects on the x  ray emission and variability can not be ignored and have to be included in theoretical models .",
    "the light bending model is probably crude and incomplete , but represents a first significant step in this direction .",
    "as mentioned , the rdc and broad fe line in  is almost constant despite large variation in the plc .",
    "however , it exhibits occasionally marked variations in the line profile such as during the 1994 observation ( iwasawa et al 1996b ) .",
    "spectra were extracted in a high , medium , and very low flux state , the difference in count rate between the low and high flux being about a factor 4 .",
    "the resulting line profiles are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ki96 ] where , from top to bottom , the line profile is for the high , medium and low flux state respectively .",
    "the general trend appears to be that the line is more peaked in high than low flux states and becomes much broader as the flux decreases . in particular , in the lowest flux state , no peak is visible at 6.4  kev and the line is very broad and redshifted . during the so  called deep minimum ( bottom  left panel in fig.[ki96 ] ) the best  fitting parameters for the line profile indicate that emission is coming from within @xmath27 providing the first evidence for the presence of a kerr bh in , later confirmed by higher quality  data .    in the framework of the light bending model ,",
    "low flux states correspond to situations in which the primary source is very close to the bh thereby illuminating very efficiently the inner disc . in higher flux states ,",
    "the source has a larger height , and the outer disc starts to be illuminated as well .",
    "therefore , the model predicts very broad and redshifted lines in low flux states ( see also fig .",
    "[ lbending2 ] , right panel ) while a peak at 6.4  kev due to emission from the outer regions of the disc appears at higher flux levels . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ki96 ] we show three profiles obtained in the light bending model for three different heights of the primary source ( @xmath75 from top to bottom ) .",
    "the profiles match the observed data rather well .",
    "it should be stressed that the plc variation between @xmath76 ( low flux ) and @xmath77 ( high flux ) is predicted to be a factor 5 , very similar to the factor 4 of the data .    further remarkable evidence for variability of the fe line on short  timescales is provided by the 1997  observation ( iwasawa et al 1999 ) .",
    "during a bright flare , the fe line profile changed dramatically .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ ki99 ] where the light curve and line profiles in two relevant time ",
    "intervals are shown .",
    "one possibility to explain such dramatic change is that a bright corotating flare appeared at about @xmath73 from the bh . given the low bh mass in  ( about @xmath78 ) the flare has enough time to complete more than one orbit during the time ",
    "interval ` a ' , therefore resulting effectively in a ring  like emitting structure which provides a good fit to the data ( iwasawa et al 1999 ) .",
    "the case for a broad relativistic fe line is very strong in . in this source ,",
    "the best  fitting parameters imply that fe has about three times the solar abundance , the disc is lowly ionized , and the rdc is particularly strong with respect to the plc ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "these conditions make it easier to detect the relativistic line in this agn than in others .",
    "indeed , it should be stressed that if these conditions were not met in , the detection of a relativistic fe line would be much more difficult , challenging present x  ray observatories .",
    "a discussion on the detectability of broad fe line in less favourable conditions is deferred to section  [ sec : broadfree ] below .",
    "here we just show another interesting case of a broad fe line , presented in fig .  [ iras ] . in the left panel ,",
    "we plot the ratio of the  data of iras  183255926 with respect to a power law model fitted in the 210  kev band .",
    "the fe line in iras  183255926 is clearly broad and exhibits a strong red wing extending down to about 4  kev ( iwasawa et al 1996a , iwasawa et al 2004 ; iwasawa et al , in preparation ) .",
    "some other agn in which resolved fe lines have been reported in the past are discussed in nandra et al ( 1997a , b ; 1999 ) ; bianchi et al ( 2001 ) ; lamer et al ( 2003 ) ; longinotti et al 2003 ; balestra et al ( 2004 ) ; porquet et al ( 2004b ) ; jimnez  bailn et al ( 2005 ) , the list being non  exhaustive .",
    "some of the fe lines in the list are not extreme and do not imply that the reflector extends down below the isco of a non  rotating bh , thereby not constraining the bh spin .",
    "the line width in these objects is however inconsistent with emission from a very distant reflector such as the torus and/or the broad line region and seems often inconsistent with being a blend of numerous narrower lines .    it should be stressed that not all broad lines are clear and unambiguous as in , and other interpretations of the data are often possible .",
    "a possible scenario is that complex absorption by large columns of highly ionized matter produces a curvature in the spectrum that resembles that of a broad fe line ( e.g.  turner et al 2005 ) .",
    "as mentioned , this was conclusively excluded for  but is a possible alternative to relativistic lines in other cases .",
    "the recently launched astro ",
    "e2 mission has enough effective area and energy resolution in the relevant fe band to test this scenario by detecting or not the absorption features associated with it .",
    "high energy data will also be crucial because they can indicate the presence / lack of strong reflection components through the detection of the compton hump therefore suggesting which interpretation is preferable .",
    "the 770  ks  observation of the lockman hole field provides also some interesting information .",
    "the lockman hole is a special field in the sky because of extremely low galactic absorption .",
    "it is therefore an ideal field to study faint agn as a population and their contribution to the x  ray background .",
    "the field comprises 53 type1 and 41 type2 agn with known redshifts .",
    "streblyanska et al ( 2005 ) have obtained the mean spectrum of type1 agn by stacking together the individual spectra and correcting for the source redshift ( see also brusa et al 2005 for a spectral stacking results from the chandra deep fields ) .",
    "the ratio of the data to a power law model for the mean type1 agn spectrum is shown in the right panel of fig .  [ iras ] and exhibits a broad emission feature peaking at 6.4  kev .",
    "a prominent broad red wing is also visible .",
    "the observed equivalent width is larger than the average value for bright nearby seyfert 1 galaxies but similar for example to  and might indicate that fe is overabundant with respect to solar values .",
    "shemmer et al ( 2004 ) have suggested that the metallicity in agns is correlated with the mass accretion rate ( close to the eddington limit ) , which is in turn related to the agn luminosity .",
    "it is possible that the large equivalent widths measured here are due to high metallicity in distant and luminous objects .",
    "the average line profile is best  fitted with an inner disc radius of @xmath30 .",
    "this may be an indication that most of the agns contain a kerr bh at their very centre which would have serious implications for the dominant bh growth mechanisms and , more broadly , on cosmology and galaxy evolution .",
    "narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies tend to show steep soft x - ray spectra , extreme x  ray variability , and sometimes broad iron emission features .",
    "one extreme such object is 1h0707 - 495 which has a marked drop in its spectrum above 7  kev .",
    "this is either an absorption edge showing partial - covering in the source ( boller et al .",
    "2002 ; gallo et al 2004 ; tanaka et al 2004 ) or the blue wing of a massive , very broad , iron line ( fabian et al .  2002b , 2004 ) .",
    "here we explore in some detail this latter possibility as an example of what could be a more general picture relevant to many other objects .",
    "1h0707495 has been observed twice by  with a deep spectral drop at 7  kev discovered in the first observation .",
    "the drop had shifted to 7.5  kev in the second observation two years later .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ 1h07line ] we show the ratio of the data ( second observation ) to a simple power law model fitted between 2 and 4  kev and above 7.5  kev .",
    "a large skewed emission feature is seen , very similar to that of  ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ mcgline ] ) together with a steep soft excess below 12  kev .",
    "we have fitted the broadband 0.510  kev spectrum with a simple two  component model comprising a plc and a relativistically blurred rdc obtaining an excellent description of the entire data set .",
    "the data require fe to have super  solar abundance ( 3 times the solar value ) and the reflector to be ionized at the level of @xmath79  erg  cm  s@xmath6 .",
    "ray reflection spectrum comes from the innermost regions of the disc with inner disc radius measured at @xmath80 and steep emissivity profile ( fabian et al 2004 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the emissivity was even steeper during the first observation which explains why the marked spectral drop ( that we interpret as the combination of the reflection edge and blue peak of the fe line ) was at lower energy ( 7  kev in the first and 7.5  kev in the second observation ) .",
    "the shift is due to gravitational redshift which is more effective in lowering the energy of sharp features when the emissivity is steeper ( i.e.  the first observation ) .",
    "fit model is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ 1h07line ] .",
    "the solution implies that the spectrum is almost completely reflection  dominated , i.e.  the plc illuminates much more efficiently the disc than the observer at infinity .",
    "this seems therefore to be a promising source in which to test further the light bending model that successfully reproduces the spectral shape and variability of the key source .",

    "the source outburst was followed up during 2001 by  ( three observations )  ( one observation ) and  itself ( 57 pointed observations ) .",

    "the line profile extends down to about 4  kev and implies emission from within the isco of a non  rotating bh . an inner disc radius at the isco of a maximal kerr hole ( @xmath28 ) is prefered over one at the isco of a schwarzschild bh at the 6@xmath87 level , strongly suggesting that the bh is rapidly , possibly maximally , spinning .",
    "the emissivity profile is much steeper than standard and implies that energy dissipation preferentially occurs in the inner few @xmath88 from the center .",
    "the source was observed three times by  and in all cases a broad relativistic fe line was detected confirming the main results of miller et al ( 2002a ) with respect to both inner disc radius and steep emissivity ( miniutti , fabian & miller 2004 ) . the broadband coverage provided by  ( up to 200  kev ) allowed us to detect the large reflection hump around 2030  kev which is the unambiguous sign of the presence of a x  ray reflection spectrum , associated with the broad fe line , giving more strength , if necessary , to the interpretation of the broad spectral feature as a relativistic fe line . the broadband spectrum during one of the  observations is shown in the bottom ",

    "the steep emissivity profile and small inner disc radius are very reminiscent of the case of . in the latter case ,",
    "the variability of the fe line was succesfully explained by the light bendind model .",
    "it is therefore an interesting exercise to study the fe line variability in xte  j1650500 as well and to put to test the light bending model not only in agns , but in gbhcs as well .",
    "the three  observations already gave some indication in that direction ( miniutti , fabian & miller 2004 ) suggesting the relevance of the light bending model for this object .",
    "further study by rossi et al ( 2005 ) confirmed the first indication in a quite spectacular way . by using the 57 pointed observation by , rossi et al studied the broad fe line variability in detail during the outburst .",
    "the results of their analysis is shown in the right panels of fig .  [ 1650 ] .",
    "the fe line flux is correlated with the power law continuum at low fluxes and then saturates ( or even shows some marginal evidence for anti ",
    "correlation ) at higher flux levels .",
    "its ratio with the power law continuum flux ( a proxy for the reflection fraction ) is generally anti  correlated with the continuum and saturates only at low fluxes .",
    "those two results match very well the predictions of the light bending model ( see e.g.fig.[lbending ] ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that during the 2001 outburst of xte  j1650500 most of the primary emission comes from a compact corona ( or the base of a jet ) located within the innermost few @xmath88 from the bh and that strong gravitational light bending is responsible for most of the observed variability , as in .",
    "a broad relativistic fe line is present in some but not all agn spectra . on the other hand  and",
    "have shown that a narrow fe line is almost ubiquitous in the x  ray spectrum of seyfert galaxies ( e.g.  page et al 2004 ; yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ) .",
    "the narrow line is generally interpreted as due to reflection from distant matter ( at the parsec scale or so ) such as the putative molecular torus , in good agreement with unification schemes . here",
    "we explore in some detail some of the possible explanations for the non  ubiquitous detection of relativistic broad lines in sources that are expected to be radiatively efficient and , according to the standard model , should have an accretion disc extending down to small radii and therefore a broad fe line as well .",
    "the x  ray spectrum of seyfert 1 and nls1 galaxies and quasars is characterised by the presence of a narrow fe line and by a soft excess , i.e.  soft excess emission with respect to the 210  kev band spectral shape .",
    "the soft excess is often interpreted as thermal emission from the accretion disc . however , this interpretation is somewhat controversial .",
    "for example , gierlinski & done ( 2004 ) have selected a sample of 26 radio  quiet pg quasars for which good  quality  observations are available and tried to characterise their soft excesses . when interpreted as thermal emission , the soft excess in the sample has a mean temperature of 120  ev with a very small variance of 20  ev only . on the other hand , the maximum temperature of a standard shakura ",
    "sunyaev disc depends on the bh mass and on the mass accretion rate , which can in turn be related to the ratio between disc luminosity and eddington luminosity as @xmath89 . for the bh masses and luminosities of the pg quasars in the gierlinski & done sample",
    ", one would expect temperatures in the range 370  ev .",
    "thus two problems arise : i ) the measured temperature of the soft excess is too uniform in sources that exhibit large differences in bh mass and luminosity ; ii ) the measured temperature is by far too high with respect to that predicted from standard accretion disc models .",
    "the uniformity of the soft excess spectral shape ( and therefore of the inferred temperatures ) was noted before by e.g.  walter & fink ( 1993 ) and czerny et al ( 2003 ) .    the uniformity and implausibly high temperature of the soft excess raises the question on the true nature of the soft excess .",
    "a uniform temperature could be easily understood if the soft spectral shape was due to atomic rather than truly thermal processes , the obvious candidate being ionized reflection from the disc .",
    "the uniformity and too large temperature of the soft excess may be then the result of applying the wrong spectral model ( thermal emission ) to the data . when a broad fe line is present ( e.g.   , 1h  0707495 ) the parameters of the reflection and relativistic blurring are all constrained by the line shape and energy .",
    "it is then remarkable that the same model , once extrapolated in the soft band , provides an excellent description of the broadband spectrum and does not need any additional soft excess .",
    "we therefore suggest that relativistically blurred ionized reflection may well be responsible for the soft excess in many other objects as well ( see also ross & fabian 2005 ; crummy et al , in preparation ) .",
    "we then construct a theoretical model for what we believe could well be the typical x  ray spectrum of radiatively efficient x ",
    "ray sources .",
    "the model comprises a power law component and reflection from distant matter ( represented by neutral reflection continuum and narrow fe line ) .",
    "the soft excess is provided by ionized reflection from the accretion disc that also contributes to the hard band mainly with a broad relativistic line .",
    "we assume solar abundances and isotropic illumination of the accretion disc with reflection fraction @xmath90 .",
    "these conditions are less favourable for the detection of the relativistic fe line than those found for example in  and 1h  0707495 , in which the fe abundance is super  solar and the rdc contribution particularly high , and should represent the typical and most common situation .",
    "the ionized reflection spectrum is convolved with a laor model reproducing the doppler and gravitational effects in an accretion disc around a maximal kerr bh ( the other parameters being the disc inclination and the emissivity index , chosen to be @xmath91 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the model is shown in the top ",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ xmmsimu ] : a flux of @xmath92  erg  @xmath2  s@xmath6 in the 210  kev band is assumed .",

    "the simulated spectrum is shown in the top ",
    "right panel of fig .",
    "[ xmmsimu ] as a ratio with a power law in the 210  kev band .",
    "the main features in the simulated spectrum are a narrow 6.4  kev fe k@xmath0 line and a soft excess below 12  kev , as generally observed in seyfert galaxies and quasars .",
    "the broad fe line is completely lost into the continuum and no detection can be claimed with any significance .",
    "in fact , the spectrum can be described by the generally adopted model ( hereafter `` standard model '' ) shown in the bottom ",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ xmmsimu ] comprising a power law , narrow fe line , and blackbody emission to model the soft excess .",
    "the fit with this model is shown in the bottom  right panel of the same figure and is excellent .",
    "it should be noted that the measured temperature of the soft excess is @xmath93  ev , exactly in the range in which the `` uniform temperature '' of the soft excess is found .",
    "the non  detection of the broad relativistic line is also very significant .",
    "this means that if the soft excess is due to ionized reflection from the disc , the associated broad fe line can not be detected with present ",
    "quality data unless some specific conditions are met such as high fe abundance , large rdc contribution , etc .",
    "this would naturally explain not only the nature of the soft excess in many sources but also the reason why the broad relativistic line is not ubiquitously detected in radiatively efficient sources . in the future , when x  ray missions with much larger effective area at 6  kev will be launched ( xeus / constellation  x ) our interpretation can be tested against data . in fig .",
    "[ conxsimu ] we show the same spectrum simulated for a 100  ks constellation  x observation . in the left panel",

    "[ xmmsimu ] ) , while in the right panel , the fit is made by using the `` standard model '' ( bottom  left of fig .",
    "[ xmmsimu ] .",
    "the `` standard model '' clearly is an unacceptable fit to the data and leaves residuals throughout the observed band , most remarkably the broad fe line between 4  kev and 7  kev as well as soft residuals due to unmodelled soft features in the reflection spectrum .",
    "good examples of broad  line  free sources from long  exposures ( among others ) are akn120 , which has no warm absorber ( vaughan et al .",
    "2004 ) , the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  3783 ( reeves et al 2004 ) , and the broad line radio galaxy 3c120 ( ballantyne , fabian & iwasawa 2004 ) .",
    "various possibilities for the lack of any line have been proposed by the authors of those and other papers including : a ) the central part of the disc is missing ; b ) the disc surface is fully ionized ( i.e.the fe is ) ; c ) the coronal emissivity function is flat , which could be due to d ) the primary x - ray sources being elevated well above the disc at say @xmath94 .",
    "there are also intermediate sources where the data are either poor or there are complex absorption components so that one can not argue conclusively that there is a relativistic line present .",
    "some narrow line components are expected from outflow , warm absorbers and distant matter in the source .",
    "one common approach in complex cases , which is not recommended , is to continue adding absorption and emission components to the spectral model until the reduced @xmath95 of the fit is acceptable , and then claim that model as the solution .",
    "very broad lines are difficult to establish conclusively unless there is something such as clear spectral variability indicating that the power - law is free of fe - k features , as found for mcg6 - 30 - 15 , or for gx339 - 4 and xte  j1650500 where the complexities of an agn are not expected .",
    "our interpretation of the spectral behaviour of  and some other sources means that we are observing the effects of very strong gravitational light bending within a few gravitational radii of a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "the short term ( 10300  ks ) behaviour is explained , without large intrinsic luminosity variability , through small variations in the position of the emitting region in a region where spacetime is strongly curved .",
    "this implies that some of the rapid variability is due to changes in the source position .",
    "now bhc in the ( intermediate ) high / soft state have high frequency breaks at higher frequency , for the same source , than when in the low / hard state ( cf .",
    "cyg x-1 , uttley & mchardy 2004 ) .",
    "this additional variability when in the soft state could be identified with relativistic light - bending effects on the power - law continuum .",
    "this picture suggests a possible generalization of the light - bending model to unify the agn and gbhc in their different states .",
    "note the work of fender , belloni & gallo ( 2004 ) which emphasises that jetted emission occurs commonly in the hard state of gbhc .",
    "the key parameter may be the mean height of the main coronal activity above the black hole .",
    "assume that much of the power of the inner disc passes into the corona ( merloni & fabian 2001a , b ) and that the coronal activity is magnetically focused close to the central axis . then at low eddington ratio the coronal height is large ( say @xmath96 or more ) , the corona is radiatively inefficient and most of the energy passes into an outflow ; basically the power flows into a jet .",
    "reflection is then appropriate for euclidean geometry and a flat disc and there is only modest broadening to the lines . if the x - ray emission from the ( relativistic ) jet dominates then x - ray reflection is small ( see e.g.  beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "the high frequency break to the power spectrum is low ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "when the eddington fraction rises above say ten per cent , the height of the activity drops below @xmath98 , the corona is more radiatively efficient and more high frequency variability occurs due to light bending and the turnover of the power spectrum rises above @xmath99 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is dominated at low heights by reflection , including reflection - boosted thermal disk emission , and a broad iron line is seen .",
    "any jet is weak .",
    "the objects with the highest spin and highest accretion rate give the most extreme behaviour .",
    "observations suggest that these include nls1 and some very high state , and intermediate state , gbhc .",
    "some broad - line - free sources do not however fit this model , so more work is required also to match the observed timing properties and not only the spectral variability .",
    "in addition to the major line emission around 6.4 kev , transient emission features at energies lower than 6.4 kev are sometimes observed in x - ray spectra of agn .",
    "as discussed , an early example was found in the asca observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 in 1997 , which was interpreted as fe k emission induced from a localised region of the disc , possibly due to illumination by a flare above it ( iwasawa et al 1999 , see fig .",
    "[ ki99 ] ) .",

    "these features can be attributed to an fe k@xmath0 line arising from relatively localised reflecting spots on the accretion disc .",
    "if the spot is close to the central black hole , then the line emission is redshifted , depending on the location of the spot on the disc ( iwasawa et al 1999 ; ruszkowski 2000 ; nayakshin & kazanas 2001 ; doviak et al 2004 ) . here",
    "we present one case only , probably the most spectacular observed so far ( ngc  3516 , iwasawa , miniutti & fabian 2004 )      iwasawa , miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) selected one of the xmm - newton observations of the bright seyfert galaxy ngc3516 , for which bianchi et al ( 2004 ) reported excess emission at around 6  kev in addition to a stronger 6.4 kev fe k@xmath0 line in the time - averaged epic spectrum and studied the short  timescale variability of the 6  kev emission feature .",

    "in contrast , the 6.4 kev line core remains largely constant , apart from a possible increase delayed from the ` on ' phase in the red feature by a few ks .",

    "[ 3516one ] ) , we constructed two spectra by selecting intervals in a periodic manner from the on and off phases to verify the implied variability in the red feature .",

    "the variability detected between the two spectra is significant at more than the @xmath101 level .",
    "we then investigated the variability of the red feature on shorter timescales to establish if not only flux , but also energy variation can be detected , with the ultimate goal of inferring the origin of the red feature .",

    "the image shows a relatively stable line core around 6.4  kev , while the red feature apparently moves with time during each on phase : the feature emerges at around 5.7 kev , shifts its peak to higher energies with time , and joins the major line component at 6.4 kev , where there is marginal evidence for an increase of the 6.4 kev line flux .",
    "this evolution appears to be repeated for the on  phases .",
    "the detection of only four cycles is not sufficient to establish any periodicity at high significance .",
    "the 25 ks is however a natural timescale of a black hole system with a black hole mass of a few times @xmath102 , as measured for ngc  3516 ( e.g onken et al 2003 ; peterson et al 2004 ) .",
    "the finding could potentially be important and , especially considering the evolution of the line emission , warrant a theoretical study .",
    "we adopt a simple model in which a flare is located above an accretion disc , corotating with it at a fixed radius .",
    "the flare illuminates an underlying region on the disc ( or spot ) which produces a reflection spectrum , including an fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "the observed line flux and energy are both phase - dependent quantities and therefore , if the flare lasts for more than one orbital period , they will modulate periodically .",
    "we therefore interpret the characteristic timescale of 25  ks we measure as the orbital period . in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "3516images ] we show a theoretical image constructed by considering a flare orbiting at @xmath103 from the bh .",
    "the theoretical model matches the data well enough .",
    "it is also possible that the emitting spot is not due to illumination from a flare but to some structure with enhanced emissivity ( due to reflection of a more central continuum ) on the disc itself ( overdensity , spiral wave , etc ) .    by constructing a large number of theoretical images and comparing them with the data we could constrain the location of the reflecting spot ( or illuminating flare ) in the range @xmath104@xmath105 from the bh . by combining this result with the timescale of 25  ks and by assuming this is the orbital period , the mass of the central bh in ngc  3516 can be estimated to be @xmath17@xmath106 , in excellent agreement with results obtained through reverberation mapping of optical emission lines .",
