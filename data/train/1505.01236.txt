    "recently the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams-02 ) on the international space station has reported that the antiproton to proton ratio stays constant from 20 gev to 450 gev kinetic energy  @xcite .",
    "this behavior can not be explained by the secondary antiprotons from collisions of ordinary cosmic rays with interstellar medium  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests a new source such as astrophysical accelerators and annihilating or decaying dark matter , although there are still uncertainties in the background modeling  @xcite .",
    "the excess of antiprotons looks surprisingly similar to what we predicted  @xcite when the pamela experiment detected the positron excess  @xcite and the fermi , hess , and atic / ppb - bets experiments observed the electron anomaly  @xcite .",
    "we considered recent supernova explosions in a dense gas cloud ( dc ) near the earth .",
    "the antiprotons and positrons are produced as secondaries by the @xmath0 collisions between cosmic - ray protons accelerated by the supernova remnant ( snr ) and target protons in a dc which surrounds the snrs  @xcite .",
    "since the fundamental process determines the branching fraction , the positron excess should accompany the antiproton excess .",
    "there are several variants of such a hadronic model , e.g. , the reacceleration of secondaries by snr shocks  @xcite or the non - standard propagation that increases secondaries from ordinary cosmic - ray collisions with interstellar matter  @xcite . since the element ratio is the same as the ordinary cosmic rays in these models , the ratio of secondaries ( e.g. , li , be , b ) to primaries ( c , n , o ) must also rise with energy beyond @xmath2 gev , which is not observed yet  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these models , our model can accommodate the observations as shown below .    before ams-02 ,",
    "the antiproton observations were consistent with the secondary background  @xcite .",
    "thus the leading models for the positron excess are leptonic , such as pulsars and leptophillic dark matter  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pulsars can not usually explain the antiproton excess .",
    "on the other hand , the dark matter for the positron excess is now severely constrained by other messengers such as gamma - rays and cosmic microwave background  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence we may need fine tunings in dark matter models to reproduce both the antiproton and positron excesses  @xcite .    following occam s razor , we reexamine our nearby snr model and simultaneously fit the antiproton fraction , positron fraction , and total electron and positron flux in light of new ams-02 data .",
    "in particular the @xmath0 collisions give the correct branching fraction for the observed positron to antiproton ratio . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt units of @xmath3 .",
    "here we consider supernova explosions which occurred around @xmath4 years ago in a dc .",
    "we assume the dc is located at around @xmath5  100200  pc away from the earth like the progenitor dcs that produced the local bubble ( lb ) or loop  i. in general a massive star tends to be born in a giant dc  @xcite which explodes as a supernova . in this paper , we assume that the giant dc is ionized and the temperature is approximately @xmath6  k at the time of its explosion  @xcite .",
    "the shock of an snr accelerates protons , which produce copious energetic mesons ( pions and kaons , etc . ) and baryons ( antiproton , proton , antineutron , neutron , etc . ) through the @xmath0 collisions in the surrounding dc .",
    "the mesons further decay into energetic positrons , electrons , gamma - rays , and neutrinos . in total those local secondary particles can be observed at the earth as cosmic - rays in addition to the standard background components .",
    "the energy spectrum of the accelerated protons is parametrized by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spectral index .",
    "the age of snr , @xmath9 , approximately determines the maximum energy  @xcite , @xmath10 where the shock velocity , @xmath11 , is @xmath12 cm  s@xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the downstream magnetic field .",
    "we take the minimum energy of the protons to be its rest mass .",
    "we assume that the supernova explodes at the center of a dc for simplicity .",
    "in addition , we also assume that the acceleration stops when the mach number of the shock decreases to 7  @xcite .",
    "we define this time as the acceleration time @xmath15 , and the energy spectrum at this time is given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 tev  @xcite .",
    "the snr continues to expand even at @xmath18 .",
    "the radius is @xmath19  pc at @xmath20  yr .",
    "since it is comparable to the size of a giant dc , @xmath21 ,  @xcite and the initial energy of the ejecta from the supernovae is larger than the binding energy of a dc , the cloud would be destroyed around this time .",
    "until it is destroyed , the dc is illuminated by the accelerated protons from the inside with the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ne ] ) given at @xmath22 .",
    "the duration of the exposure , @xmath23 , could be approximated by the time elapsing from the explosion of the supernovae to the destruction of the dc because the timescale @xmath24 is shorter than @xmath25  yr .",
    "after the destruction of the dc , the produced charged particles such as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or @xmath29 propagate through diffusion processes and reach to the earth .",
    "since we assume that the dc has already been destroyed well before the present epoch , there are some differences in arrival times between those charged particles and massless neutral particles such as photons .",
    "it should be a reasonable assumption that we would not detect any photon and neutrino signals from the dc @xmath30 years after the destruction of the dc .",
    "we have calculated spectra of those daughter particles through the @xmath0 collisions by performing the pythia monte - carlo event generator  @xcite ( see  @xcite for the details ) .",
    "then we solve the diffusion equation of the charged particle `` @xmath31 '' ( @xmath31 runs @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , ) , @xmath32 + q(\\varepsilon_{i})\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the distribution function of an @xmath31 particle , and @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the energy of the @xmath31 particle . the flux is given by @xmath36 we adopt a diffusion model 08 - 005 given in  @xcite with the diffusion coefficient , @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xcite .",

    "this set of the parameters approximately corresponds to the med model of the cosmic - ray propagation  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the timescale of the production is shorter than that of the diffusion , @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the distance to the source , and the source of the daughter particles is spatially localized sufficiently , we can use the known analytical solution in  @xcite .",
    "when the shape of the source spectrum is a power - law with an index @xmath44 to be @xmath45 then the solution is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and the diffusion length is represented by @xmath48 @xmath49 means the effective distance to the source by spatially averaging the distance to the volume element of the source , and we assume @xmath50 .",
    "we approximately have @xmath51 with @xmath52 the source volume where @xmath53 the differential cross section of the `` @xmath54''-mode for the production of the @xmath31 particle is represented to be @xmath55 with the multiplicity into the @xmath54-mode , @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the velocity of the primary proton .",
    "we also consider the free neutron ( antineutron ) decay for the electron ( positron ) production process , which is not included in the original version of pythia .",
    "the initial proton spectrum @xmath58 can be obtained by a normalization to satisfy @xmath59 for the local propagation of protons and antiprotons , their cooling is negligible unlike electrons and positrons .",
    "additionally we can omit annihilations of antiprotons through scattering off the background protons because the scattering rate is small .",
    "we can also omit convection by interstellar turbulence within the galaxy .",
    "an analytical solution for the proton and the antiproton is also given by the same equation as eq .",

    ", we adopted the 20@xmath61 smaller value of the mean value shown in  @xcite . here , the radius of a spherical dc , @xmath62  pc is adopted .",
    "the target proton density is set to be @xmath63 . the spectral index @xmath64 and the maximum energy , @xmath65  tev , are assumed .",
    "we take the duration of the @xmath0 collision to be @xmath66  yr . the total energy of the accelerated protons is assumed to be @xmath67  erg .",

    "about the diffusion time of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71  yr is adopted .",

    "[ fig : posifra ]    in fig .  2",
    ", we also plot the positron fraction and the total @xmath69+@xmath70 flux .",
    "it is remarkable that we can automatically fit the observational data of both the positron fraction and the total @xmath69 + @xmath70 flux by using the same set of the parameters  @xcite . here",
    "the cooling cutoff energy is approximately given by @xmath73  1  tev ( @xmath74 yrs)@xmath75 .",
    "the positron fraction rises at higher energies than that of the antiproton fraction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : posifra ] ) , because the spectral index of the background antiproton is harder than that of the background positron .",
    "this comes from a difference between their cooling processes . only for background positrons and electrons",
    "the cooling is effective in the current situation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : posipbar ] , we plot the positron to antiproton ratio as a function of the rigidity . here",
    "the local components represent the contribution of the nearby snrs produced only by the @xmath0 collisions . from this figure",
    ", we find that both of the positron and the antiproton can be consistently fitted only by adding astrophysical local contributions produced from the same @xmath0 collision sources .",
    "collisions occurred at snrs near the earth .",
    "the thick solid line represents the case of the total flux . from the upper right to the lower left , we plot the flux ratios of 1 ) the one at the source ( without cooling ) , 2 ) only the local components , 3 ) the total of the local and the background components , and 4 ) only the background components .",
    "the observational data reported by ams-02 are also plotted . ,",
    "width=377 ]    [ fig : posipbar ]",
    "we have discussed the anomaly of the antiproton fraction recently - reported by the ams-02 experiment . by considering the same origin of the @xmath0 collisions between cosmic - ray protons accelerated by snrs and a dense cloud which surrounds the snrs",
    ", we can fit the data of the observed antiproton and positron simultaneously in the natural model parameters .",
    "the observed fluxes of both antiprotons and positrons are consistent with our predictions shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "regardless of the model details , the ratio of antiproton to positron is essentially determined by the fundamental branching fraction into each mode of the @xmath0 collisions .",
    "thus the observed antiproton excess should entail the positron excess , and vice versa .",
    "this does not depend on the propagation model since both antiparticles propagate in a similar way below the cooling cutoff energy @xmath5 tev .",
    "the cutoff energy of @xmath69 cooling marks the supernova age of @xmath1 years  @xcite , while we also expect a @xmath28 cutoff .",
    "the trans - tev energy will be probed by the future calet , dampe and cta experiments @xcite .",
    "an anisotropy of the arrival direction is also a unique signature , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we may estimate the amplitude of anisotropy as @xmath76 , which is below the upper limits by fermi observations  @xcite .",
    "the boron to carbon ratio as well as the li to carbon ratio have no clear excesses  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the carbon fraction of the excess - making cosmic rays is smaller than that of the ordinary cosmic rays . in general the supernovae in the dc",
    "would not be the main channel of cosmic - ray production .",
    "most of cosmic rays above @xmath77 gev may be produced in chemically enriched regions , such as superbubbles , as implied by the hard spectrum of cosmic - ray helium  @xcite . or the carbon abundance of the destroyed dc might happen to be lower than the galactic average  @xcite",
    ".    we should be careful about the background systematics .",
    "in particular the propagation uncertainties yield the largest errors  @xcite .",
    "however , in the energy region above @xmath2 gev where the background contribution is small , the observed positron to antiproton ratio is very close to the branching fraction of the @xmath0 collisions ( source components in fig .",
    "[ fig : posipbar ] ) .",
