    "the global @xmath3 chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian ( for massless quarks ) is broken by the @xmath4 adler - bell - jackiw anomaly of the @xmath5 singlet axial current @xmath6 . through the study of instantons @xcite",
    ", it has been realized that this anomaly has physical effects with the result that the theory contains neither a conserved @xmath7 quantum number , nor an extra goldstone boson . instead the effective @xmath8 quark interactions arise , which are known as t hooft interactions . in the case of two flavors they are four - fermion interactions , and",
    "the resulting low - energy theory resembles the old nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio model @xcite . in the case of three flavors they are six - fermion interactions which are responsible for the correct description of @xmath9 and @xmath10 physics , and",
    "additionally lead to the ozi - violating effects @xcite , @xmath11 where the matrices @xmath12 are projectors and determinant is over flavor indices .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom of qcd at low - energies are mesons . the bosonization of the effective quark interaction ( [ ldet ] ) by the path integral approach has been considered in @xcite , where the lowest order stationary phase approximation ( spa ) has been used to estimate the leading contribution from the t hooft determinant . in this approximation",
    "the functional integral is dominated by the stationary trajectories @xmath13 , determined by the extremum condition @xmath14 of the action @xmath15 .",
    "the lowest order spa corresponds to the case in which the integrals associated with @xmath16 , for the path @xmath13 are neglected and only @xmath17 contributes to the generating functional .",
    "the next natural step in this scenario is to complete the semiclassical result of reinhardt and alkofer by including the contribution from the integrals associated with the second functional derivative @xmath18 , and this is the subject of our paper .",
    "an alternative method of bosonizing the t hooft determinant has been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the special path integral representation for the quark determinant has been obtained by considering @xmath19 as an algebraically large parameter .",
    "one should not forget that the t hooft s determinant interactions are induced by instantons and only can be written in the simple determinantal form ( [ ldet ] ) in the limit of large number of colours  otherwise the many - fermion interactions have a more complicated structure .",
    "for our calculations it means , in particular , that the terms of the bosonized lagrangian induced by the t hooft s determinant interaction ( [ ldet ] ) should be of order @xmath20 , corresponding to the standard rules of @xmath19 counting . in this respect",
    "it is worthwhile to note that we have found that the meson vertices , induced by the t hooft s determinant interactions in the lowest order spa and the term from the integral associated with the second functional derivative @xmath18 have the same @xmath19-order and should be considered on the same footing .",
    "to be definite , let us consider the theory of the quark fields in four dimensional minkowski space , with dynamics defined by the lagrangian density @xmath21 the first term here is the extended version of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) lagrangian @xmath22 , consisting of the free field part @xmath23 and the @xmath24 chiral symmetric four - quark interaction @xmath25.\\ ] ] we assume that quark fields have color and flavor indices running through the set @xmath26 ; @xmath27 are the standard @xmath28 gell - mann matrices with @xmath29 .",
    "the current quark mass , @xmath30 , is a nondegenerate diagonal matrix with elements @xmath31 , it explicitly breaks the global chiral @xmath24 symmetry of the @xmath32 lagrangian .",
    "the second term in ( [ totlag ] ) is given by ( [ ldet ] ) .",
    "letting @xmath33 yields @xmath34\\ ] ] with determinants written in terms of the mesonic type quark bilinears .",
    "this identity is a first step to the bosonization of the theory with lagrangian ( [ totlag ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by the vacuum transition amplitude in the form of the path integral @xmath35 by means of a simple trick , suggested by reinhardt and alkofer , it is easy to write down this amplitude as @xmath36 with @xmath37                + r_1^a(\\sigma_a+g\\bar{q}\\lambda_aq )                \\nonumber \\\\              & + & r_2^a(\\phi_a - g\\bar{q}i\\gamma_5\\lambda_aq )                -\\frac{\\kappa}{(4g)^3}\\left [                 \\mbox{det}(\\sigma+i\\phi )                + \\mbox{det}(\\sigma - i\\phi ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([genf2 ] ) defines the same expression as eq.([genf1 ] ) . to see this one has to integrate first over auxiliary fields @xmath38 .",
    "it leads to @xmath39-functionals which can be integrated out by taking integrals over @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , and which bring us back to the expression ( [ genf1 ] ) . from the other side ,",
    "it is easy to rewrite eq.([genf2 ] ) in a form appropriate to finish the bosonization , i.e. , to calculate the integrals over quark fields and integrate out from @xmath42 the unphysical part of the auxiliary @xmath38 scalar fields . indeed , introducing new variables @xmath43 , and after that @xmath44 we have @xmath45 where @xmath46                -2(r_{1a}\\sigma_a+r_{2a}\\phi_a )                -\\frac{\\kappa}{8}\\left [                 \\mbox{det}(r_{1}+ir_{2 } )                + \\mbox{det}(r_{1}-ir_{2})\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fermi fields enter the action bilinearly , we can always integrate over them , because in this case we deal with the standard gaussian type integral . at this stage",
    "one should also shift the scalar fields @xmath47 by demanding that the vacuum expectation values of the shifted fields vanish @xmath48 .",
    "in other words , all tadpole graphs in the end should sum to zero , giving us gap equations to fix parameters @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 , with @xmath51 denoting the constituent quark masses . to evaluate path integrals over @xmath52",
    "one has to use the method of stationary phase , or , after the formal analytic continuation in the time coordinate @xmath53 , the method of steepest descents .",
    "let us consider this task in some detail .",
    "the euclidean ( imaginary time ) version of the path integral under consideration is @xmath54 this integral is hopelessly divergent even if @xmath55 .",
    "one should say at this point that we are not really interested in ( [ intj ] ) but only in its analytic continuation . let us suppose we analytically change @xmath56 in some way such that we go from this situation back to the one of interest . to keep the integral convergent",
    ", we must distort the contour of integration into the complex plane following the standard procedure of the method of the steepest descents .",
    "this method gives the first term in an asymptotic expansion of @xmath57 , valid for @xmath58 .",
    "we lead the contour along the straight line which is parallel to the imaginary axis and crosses the real axis at the saddle point @xmath59 .",
    "it is in the sense of this continuation that the integral @xmath57 of ( [ intj ] ) is to be interpreted as @xmath60 near the saddle point @xmath59 , @xmath61 where the saddle point , @xmath59 , is a solution of the equations @xmath62 determining a flat spot of the surface @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 this system is well - known from @xcite .",
    "the totally symmetric constants , @xmath65 , come from the definition of the flavor determinant : @xmath66 , and equal to @xmath67 they are closely related with the @xmath28 constants @xmath68 .",
    "we use in ( [ lagr4 ] ) symbols @xmath69 for the differences @xmath70 . to deal with the multitude of integrals in ( [ ancj ] ) we define a column vector @xmath71 with eighteen components",

    "though , some comments should be made about what we have done so far :    \\(1 ) the first exponential factor in eq.([ancj2 ] ) is not new .",
    "it has been obtained by reinhardt and alkofer in @xcite .",
    "a bit of manipulation with expressions ( [ lagr3 ] ) and ( [ saddle ] ) leads us to the result @xmath77              -2[(\\sigma + \\delta)_ar^a_{1\\mbox{st } }              + \\phi_ar^a_{2\\mbox{st}}]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] one can try to solve eqs.([saddle ] ) looking for solutions @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the form of increasing powers in @xmath80 @xmath81 putting these expansions in eqs.([saddle ] ) one can obtain the series of selfconsistent equations to determine the constants @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 @xmath85 the other constants can be obtained from these ones , for instance , we have @xmath86 as a result the effective lagrangian ( [ lrst ] ) can be expanded in powers of meson fields .",
    "such an expansion ( up to the terms which are cubic in @xmath87 ) looks like @xmath88    \\(2 ) our result ( [ ancj2 ] ) has been based on the assumption that all eigenvalues of matrix @xmath89 are positive .",
    "it is true , for instance , if @xmath90 .",
    "it may happen , however , that some eigenvalues of @xmath89 are negative for some range of parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in these cases",
    "there are no conceptual difficulties , for from the very beginning we deal with well defined gaussian integrals and the integration over the corresponding @xmath93 simply does not require analytic continuation .",
    "we now turn to the evaluation of the path integral in eq.([ancj2 ] ) . in order to define the measure @xmath94",
    "more accurately let us expand @xmath93 in a fourier series @xmath95 assuming that suitable boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the set of the real functions @xmath96 form an orthonormal and complete sequence @xmath97 therefore @xmath98 the normalization constant @xmath99 is not important for the following .",
    "the matrix @xmath100 is equal to @xmath101 from ( [ qab ] ) and ( [ compl ] ) it follows that @xmath102 with @xmath103 only the matrix @xmath104 depends here on fields @xmath105 . by absorbing in @xmath99 the irrelevant field independent part of @xmath106 , and expanding the logarithm in the representation @xmath107",
    ", one can obtain finally for the integral in ( [ ancj2 ] ) @xmath108\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty        \\varphi_m(x)\\varphi_m(x)\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the sum over @xmath109 in this expression , however , is not well defined and needs to be regularized .",
    "one can regularize it by introducing a gaussian cutoff @xmath110 damping the contributions from the large momenta @xmath111 @xmath112 this procedure does not decrease the predictability of the model , for anyway one has to regularize the quark loop contributions in ( [ genf3 ] ) . alternatively , following ideas presented in @xcite , one can introduce the ansatz : @xmath113\\right\\}\\ ] ] proposing that the undetermined dimensionless constant @xmath114 will be fixed by confronting the model with experiment afterwards .",
    "let us study the ground state of the model under consideration , then properties of the excitations will follow naturally . to make further progress",
    "let us note that eqs.([ha ] ) have non - trivial solutions for @xmath115 , corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the physical vacuum state with order parameters @xmath116 .",
    "we may then use this fact to rewrite eqs.([ha ] ) as a system of only three equations to give @xmath117 @xmath118 where the totally symmetric coefficients @xmath119 are equal to zero except for @xmath120 .",
    "they are related to coefficients @xmath65 by the embedding formula @xmath121 where matrices @xmath122 , and @xmath123 are defined as follows    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     let us consider now the general case which we have when @xmath124 in eq.([gap ] ) . to illustrate the qualitative difference with the previous case we put for definiteness @xmath125 and look again for the solutions @xmath126 and @xmath127 with the same set of fixed parameters .",
    "the corresponding curves are plotted in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "if the mass @xmath128 is sufficiently low that @xmath129 , ( in the figures denoted by the region left the turning point @xmath130 ) or sufficiently high that @xmath131 , ( in the figures denoted by the region right to the turning point @xmath132 ) , then there exists again a single solution with unique values of @xmath133 .",
    "however , there is now a region for @xmath128 in which @xmath134 , where three values of couplings @xmath135 are possible .",
    "conversely , one can study the solutions : @xmath136 at fixed values of input parameters : @xmath137 . as starting input values for the couplings @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the gap equations we take the ones already determined along the path @xmath138 shown in fig.[fig2 ] , obtained at a constant value of the strange quark mass , @xmath139 mev . for a chosen value of the set @xmath133",
    "we then search for further solutions @xmath140 of the eq.([gap ] ) , displaying results in fig.[fig3 ] for @xmath128 and in fig.[fig4 ] for @xmath141 , correspondingly .",
    "the dashed curves are the repetition of the solutions encountered in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the bold dashes in fig.[fig3 ] indicate that we only find this one solution at fixed values of @xmath142 . combining the information of figs.[fig3 ] and [ fig4 ]",
    ", one sees that one has up to four solutions at fixed @xmath142 .",
    "indeed , travelling along the original path @xmath138 one observes the following : the branch @xmath143 is accompanied by three other branches , marked as @xmath144 and @xmath99 which belong to the same class of solutions .",
    "one sees that these solutions have negative @xmath92 values . from the turning point @xmath132 until the maximum value of @xmath91 ( and corresponding @xmath92 ) ( bold dashes ) we have no other solutions to the gap equations , as already stated . from this maximum @xmath91 value to the turning point @xmath130 and further along the @xmath145 arm we encounter further two branches , denoted by @xmath146 and @xmath147 to the solutions of eqs.([gap ] ) with same @xmath142 .",
    "they are positive @xmath92 solutions .",
    "this very rich structure of the vacuum solutions implies the possibility of having several different values of the quark condensates for the same @xmath142 parameters , embracing also the possibility which has been considered in connection with generalized chiral perturbation theory ( see e.g. section 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we give here only a few examples . at @xmath148",
    "we have three solutions .",
    "the solution @xmath149 , on the @xmath145 arm has the quark condensates @xmath150 , @xmath151 and the ratio @xmath152 ; the second solution , on the @xmath147 branch with @xmath153 has condensates @xmath154 , @xmath155 and the ratio @xmath156 ; the third solution , located at the @xmath146 branch with @xmath157 has condensates @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "we chose the next example at @xmath161 , where there are four solutions .",
    "the solution @xmath162 , on the @xmath143 arm has the quark condensates @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 ; the second solution , on the @xmath166 branch with @xmath167 has condensates @xmath154 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 ; the third solution , located at the @xmath170 branch with @xmath171 has condensates @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the fourth solution , on the @xmath99 branch , with @xmath175 has condensates @xmath176 , @xmath177 and the ratio @xmath178 . as a final example",
    "we take the solutions at @xmath179 , where the branches @xmath146 and @xmath147 emerge and are very close to each other with @xmath180 .",
    "the corresponding condensates are @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the other solution is at the path @xmath184 with @xmath185 with condensates @xmath186 , @xmath164 and @xmath187 .    to summarize",
    ", we have found that in the presence of the t hooft interaction , treated beyound the lowest order spa , several solutions to the gap equations are possible at some range of input parameters , i.e. the same values of @xmath188 lead to different sets of constituent quark masses @xmath189 and , therefore , to different values of the quark condensates .",
    "a quite different scenario emerges for the hadronic vacuum , which can now be multivalued .",
    "it makes our result essentially different from the ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "these findings must be further analysed in order to establish which of the extrema correspond to minima or maxima of the effective potential .",
    "this step will be done elsewhere in conjunction with the determination of the meson mass spectrum , as it also requires dealing with the terms with two powers of the meson fields in the ansatz of solutions eq.([rst ] ) and in the related lagrangian ( [ lam ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this work has been twofold .",
    "firstly we have developed the technique which is necessary to go beyound the lowest order spa in the problem of the path integral bosonization of the t hooft six quark interaction .",
    "we have shown how the pre - exponential factor , connected with the steepest descent approach and which is responsible for the quantum fluctuations around the classical path , can be treated exactly , order by order , in a scheme of increasing number of mesonic fields , while preserving all chiral symmetry requirements .",
    "this technique is rather general and can be readily used in other applications .",
    "second , we have explored with considerable detail the implications of taking the quantum fluctuations in account in the description of the hadronic vacuum .",
    "a very complex multivalued vacuum emerges at fixed values of the input parameters @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath190 and current quark masses .",
    "we encountered several classes of solutions . searching in an interval of constituent quark masses from zero to @xmath191gev",
    ", we found @xmath142 , regions caracterized by one , three and four solutions .",
    "the multiple vacua may have very interesting physical consequences and applications .",
    "we are grateful to dmitri diakonov for valuable correspondence .",
    "we thank dmitri osipov and pedro costa for their help in converting the `` mathematica '' generated figures into the final ones .",
