    "temperature chaos  @xcite , is one of the outstanding mysteries posed by spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "it consists in the complete reorganization of the equilibrium configurations by the slightest change in temperature .",
    "the topic is currently under intense theoretical scrutiny  @xcite , not only because of its importance to analyze spectacular experiments  @xcite , but also as a crucial tool to assess the performance of quantum annealers  @xcite .",
    "here we exploit some of its very peculiar features to show that temperature chaos is a spatially non - local effect . for a disordered system",
    ", chaos should be studied on a sample by sample basis . in particular , for system sizes accessible to equilibrium computer simulations , chaos is a rare event , present only in a small fraction of the samples ( as the system size increases , so does the fraction of chaotic samples  @xcite ) .",
    "we use this fact by thermalizing spin glasses down to a very low temperature ( well below the critical temperature @xmath0 ) .",
    "then , for each simulated system , with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , we consider its image under a transformation where we make the boundary conditions anti - periodic ( apbc ) in one direction . as we discuss below , this transformation amounts to change a tiny fraction of the coupling constants . now , due to the gauge invariance in spin glasses , the couplings that have been changed by our transformation can be placed _",
    "anywhere _ in the lattice .",
    "interestingly enough , whether or not the pbc instance is chaotic carries essentially no information on the behaviour of its apbc transform .",
    "it follows that temperature chaos is not encoded in any localized region of the system .",
    "we remark that our work relates as well to the long - standing controversy regarding the nature of the spin - glass phase . on the one hand ,",
    "the replica symmetry breaking theory ( stemming from the mean - field solution ) envisages the spin - glass phase as composed of a multiplicity of states  @xcite .",
    "thus , from this point of view , the change of boundary conditions is a strong perturbation and there are no reasons to expect that temperature chaos effects will be significantly correlated for the pbc system and its apbc transform . on the other hand , the droplet picture  @xcite expects a single domain wall difference between the two types of boundary conditions , so there would be a strong correlation of the temperature chaos effects for the pbc / apbc systems . in this respect ,",
    "our data favour replica symmetry breaking ( because little correlation is observed ) . however , it has been pointed out many times that resolving this controversy requires studying much larger systems than it is accessible to current simulations ( or experiments  @xcite ) .",
    "this work is no exception .",
    "furthermore , our analysis relies crucially in that the system sizes are modest .",
    "indeed , we rely in that temperature chaos is a rare - event _ on small systems _ while , for larger systems , one expects that _ typical _ samples will display strong chaotic events .",
    "the layout of the remaining part of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : model ] we recall the model definition and the crucial quantities we study .",

    "our conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "technical details are provided in two appendices .",
    "our @xmath1 spins occupy the nodes of a @xmath2 lattice of size @xmath3 endowed with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath4 the couplings @xmath5 are @xmath6 with @xmath7 probability and only connect nearest neighbouring sites on the lattice . a particular realization of these couplings ( quenched , i.e. , fixed once and for all )",
    "is called a sample .",
    "thermal averages for fixed @xmath8 are denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "this system has a second - order phase transition at temperature @xmath10  @xcite .    for any original ( periodic , pbc ) instance its anti - periodic pair ( apbc )",
    "is obtained by reversing the coupling @xmath11 that join sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 for all values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 [ only a @xmath16 fraction of the bonds is changed  ] .",
    "the apbc image could be a perfectly reasonable original instance , and , in fact , it is as probable as its pbc pair .",
    "( solid symbols ) and the energy per bond @xmath17 ( empty symbols ) as a function of temperature .",
    "the dotted vertical line marks the critical temperature .",
    "a chaotic event for sample a at @xmath18 is signalled by the strong drop of @xmath19 . on the other hand , the effect in the energy is very subtle . * bottom : * probability distribution of the chaos integral @xmath20 , as computed for lattices @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( for all @xmath25 , the same set of temperatures was used in the parallel tempering simulations ) .",
    "the distributions obtained with pbc and apbc are , of course , identical .",
    "the fraction of chaotic samples ( i.e. , small @xmath26 ) increases with system size . @xmath27 data from ref .",
    "[ fig : chaos ] ]    the system described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ea ] ) has a gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "the energy remains unchanged under the following transformation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 can be chosen arbitrarily for each site @xmath30 .",
    "now consider the transformation where @xmath31 and all other @xmath32 .",
    "this changes only the @xmath33 that were reversed by the apbc transformation and those joining planes @xmath34 and @xmath35 , moving in this way the transformed - couplings plane from @xmath36 to @xmath34 . using the same idea",
    ", we can place the transformed plane at any @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , one can deform the plane of inverted couplings locally in an essentially arbitrary way by considering a more complicated gauge transformation . in short ,",
    "the pbc @xmath38 apbc transformation is non - local .",
    "another consequence of this gauge symmetry is the need to use real replicas of the system ( i.e. , copies that evolve independently but share the same couplings ) in order to form gauge - invariant observables ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .     as computed for each of our 4000 pairs of samples with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "hereafter we shall only show data from this simulation ( the qualitatively identical results for other values of @xmath25 and @xmath41 can be found in  [ ap : additional ] ) .",
    "[ fig : scatter - i ] ]    we have simulated system sizes @xmath21 with parallel tempering  @xcite , carrying out several sets of runs for varying minimum temperature : @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath39 .",
    "we have studied the same @xmath45 samples and their @xmath45 apbc counterparts for all @xmath41 .",
    "since we want to study single - sample quantities and chaos , it has been very important to assess thermalization sample by sample by studying the temperature - mixing auto - correlation time of the parallel tempering  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we use the thermalization criteria of  @xcite ( see also  [ ap : parameters ] ) .",
    "recently there has been much progress in the numerical characterization of temperature chaos  @xcite .",
    "a distinguishing feature of a chaotic sample is a very long auto - correlation time @xmath46 for temperature - mixing along a parallel tempering simulation .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath46 is very difficult to measure with any precision , even for well equilibrated systems  @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , see also  [ ap : i - or - tau ] , this difficulty can be skirted by choosing a different quantity , easier to measure but strongly correlated with @xmath46 .    in particular , we study the overlap between the spin configurations at temperatures @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 and use it to define a _ chaos parameter _",
    "@xcite : @xmath50 in these equations , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are extracted from different real replicas .",
    "@xmath53 is small when the equilibrium configurations at @xmath47 and @xmath48 differ significantly . instead , @xmath54 in the absence of temperature chaos .     for our pbc samples ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 )",
    "now , let us consider the typical samples , namely those spanning the @xmath55 probability range around the median ( the third quintile , if we divide the population in fifths ) .",
    "these third quintile samples belong to the narrow @xmath26 interval bounded by the two vertical green lines",
    ". since temperature chaos is still rare for this system size , the third quintile samples are not chaotic",
    ". however , their apbc transforms ( blue histogram ) span the whole @xmath26 interval and reproduce the @xmath56 for pbc . indeed , an anderson - darling non - parametric test  @xcite yields a @xmath57-value of @xmath58 for the equal - distribution hypothesis .",
    "* inset : * had we selected the @xmath55 most chaotic pbc instances ( first quintile ) the @xmath56 for their apbc images would be slightly but definitively biased towards small @xmath20 ( anderson - darling @xmath57-value of @xmath59 ) .",
    "indeed , the inset shows the conditional probability of having @xmath60 in the @xmath61-th quintile , given a fixed pbc quintile . for the central pbc quintile ,",
    "the apbc conditional probability is uniform .",
    "for the first pbc quintile the apbc conditional probability is very slightly weighted to small @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig : quintiles ] ]     and @xmath62 data . *",
    "top : * for the free - energy  ( [ eq : f ] ) we plot @xmath63 for each of our 4000 sample pairs .",
    "the green straight line is @xmath64 .",
    "* center : * for the subtracted free - energy  ( [ eq : f - sub ] ) we plot @xmath65 . *",
    "bottom : * we plot @xmath66 . [",
    "fig : f - i ] ]    we illustrate the ideas behind these parameters in figure  [ fig : chaos]top , where we represent @xmath67 for two samples @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the ratio of their respective temperature - mixing times is @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , for sample a we can appreciate a very sudden drop in @xmath67 ( which we name a chaotic event ) for a low value of @xmath48 , while sample b has a smooth @xmath19 .",
    "this behaviour can be summarized by saying that chaotic samples ( such as a ) have a low value of @xmath26 ( essentially the integral of @xmath19 ) , while non - chaotic samples have a high @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chaos]bottom shows that the probability of finding a chaotic event in a prefixed temperature interval increases for larger system size  , @xmath47 and @xmath48 the probability of having @xmath71 drops exponentially in @xmath3  @xcite . ] .",
    "we note also from figure  [ fig : chaos]top that the energy relates only in a very subtle way with temperature chaos .",
    "we shall further explore this relation below , since this quantity has been much emphasized in the literature  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us mention that we will base our analysis on @xmath26 .",
    "however , essentially identical results are obtained from the temperature - mixing time @xmath46 , as shown in  [ ap : i - or - tau ] .",
    "as fig .  [ fig : scatter - i ] shows , the chaos integral @xmath26 for a sample has very low correlation to the @xmath26 value for its apbc transform .",
    "yet , the @xmath26 s are not normally distributed ( because the shape of the scatter plot is not elliptical ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the characterization of correlations through the _ very _ small correlation parameter @xmath72 is not complete .",
    "however , we can confirm the virtual absence of correlations is confirmed by a more refined analysis .",
    "we start by considering the full probability distribution of @xmath26 for our pbc samples , which spans a wide range of values and of course coincides with the @xmath56 for all the apbc samples .",
    "we then take the most typical samples , those contained in an interval of 20% probability around the median ( the third quintile ) .",
    "all these samples , which span a very narrow @xmath26 range , are non - chaotic . if we consider the apbc transforms of this median samples at a first glance one can observe that they span the whole @xmath26 and therefore contain also chaotic instances .",
    "more precisely , one can construct the histogram of @xmath26 values for the apbc images of the pbc median , which turns out to reproduce exactly the full probability distribution of @xmath26 for this system .",
    "this is graphically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quintiles ] but it can be proven using statistical methods . in particular , an anderson - darling non - parametric test  @xcite finds no difference between the full probability distribution of @xmath26 for the @xmath73 system and the probability distribution of the images of the ( non - chaotic ) pbc median .    in short ,",
    "the @xmath26 value of the apbc image of a median sample is completely uncorrelated with its @xmath74 .",
    "if we repeat the same analysis , using not the median pbc samples but the 20% most chaotic ones ( the first quintile in @xmath26 ) we would find that again the apbc images span the whole @xmath26 range but now with a small bias toward low @xmath26 ( see inset to fig .  [",
    "fig : quintiles ] ) .",
    "this is the reason for the non - gaussian behaviour observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter - i ] .    note that figs .",
    "[ fig : scatter - i ] and  [ fig : quintiles ] are obtained from only one of our sets of simulations , but our results are essentially @xmath25- and @xmath41-independent ( see  [ ap : additional ] ) .",
    "the free - energy change upon varying boundary conditions , @xmath75 , has received much attention  @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , the relation between @xmath76 and the spin correlations [ e.g. , the chaos parameter @xmath19  ( [ eq : x ] ) ] , is yet to be researched .",
    "we can investigate @xmath76 from our parallel tempering simulations by means of thermodynamic integration : @xmath77 here , @xmath24 is the maximum temperature in our parallel tempering simulation . note that , for large enough @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , for a temperature @xmath80 such that the high - temperature expansion converges  @xcite , @xmath81 goes to zero exponentially in @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chaos]top shows that chaotic events have an impact , albeit subtle , on the temperature evolution of @xmath82 .",
    "hence , we expect some correlation between @xmath19 and the free energy .",
    "the question we address here is : how can we extract these correlations ?",
    "first , we note that @xmath83 is not a good chaos indicator by itself .",
    "this is clear already from fig .",
    "[ fig : chaos ] , but can be be seen more explicitly in figure  [ fig : f - i]top , where we show that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are almost equal ( their correlation parameter is about @xmath86 ) .",
    "however , on a closer inspection one realizes that chaotic events , even close to @xmath87 , result in minimal energy changes  @xcite . in other words , even in the most favourable case where only one member of the ( pbc , apbc ) pair has a chaotic event , the energy difference between the two samples is very small .",
    "therefore , some sort of background subtraction is needed to enhance the chaotic signal : @xmath88 notice that , at very low temperature , ( [ eq : f - sub ] ) highlights the entropic contribution .",
    "as we in see figure  [ fig : f - i]centre , @xmath89 is correlated with the chaos integral @xmath26 . however",
    ", this correlation is only of @xmath90 and the scatter plot has a non - trivial structure , seemingly composed of two different populations .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 , by itself , still does not seem a very good indicator of temperature chaos .",
    "it is important to notice that the very strong correlation of @xmath92 , together with the ( weaker ) correlation of @xmath93 is in no contradiction with our previous assertion that @xmath94 are uncorrelated .    in order to see why ,",
    "let us consider two stochastic variables , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , that have the same variance @xmath95 and covariance @xmath96 .",
    "their covariance matrix has eigenvalues @xmath97 , and the corresponding normal coordinates are @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that the correlation coefficient is @xmath99 clearly , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , play the role of the stochastic variables @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the above reasoning . now , as we shall explain next , there is a physical reason implying that @xmath102 is orders of magnitude larger than @xmath103 .",
    "it follows that the correlation coefficient is @xmath104 ( as we find indeed ) .",
    "in other words , the only information in fig .",
    "4-top is @xmath105 .",
    "the physical reason underlying @xmath105 is quite simple . on the one hand",
    "the sample to sample fluctuations of the free - energy are of order @xmath106 . on the other hand , @xmath103 , which is the variance of @xmath107 scales with the so called stiffness exponent @xmath108 with @xmath109 in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "an elementary computation tells us that @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "a consequence of this analysis is that the free - energy difference @xmath112 is probably a much better chaos indicator than @xmath113 by itself .",
    "this is confirmed by figure  [ fig : f - i]bottom , which shows an enhanced correlation between @xmath114 and @xmath115 , with a more gaussian behaviour .    in conclusion , the free energy is related to temperature chaos as studied from the spatial correlation functions , but its sample - to - sample fluctuations are affected by several factors not related to chaos ( see  [ ap : ineq ] ) .",
    "therefore , a refined analysis is needed to extract information about the chaos integrals from @xmath116 .",
    "we have shown that temperature chaos , one of the most complex effects in glass physics , is a non - local phenomenon .",
    "our approach has two fundamental ingredients : the recent rare - event characterization of chaos and the very special nature of periodic boundary conditions transformations in disordered systems .",
    "in fact , anti - periodic boundary conditions can not be precisely located in a finite region of the system .",
    "so , changing a tiny [ @xmath117 fraction of the coupling constants produces a dramatic effect in the physics of the considered sample ( and the spatial location of the changed couplings has little importance ) .",

    "<S> temperature chaos plays a role in important effects , like for example memory and rejuvenation , in spin glasses , colloids , polymers . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically investigate temperature chaos in spin glasses , exploiting its recent characterization as a rare - event driven phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiarities of the transformation from periodic to anti - periodic boundary conditions in spin glasses allow us to conclude that temperature chaos is non - local : no bounded region of the system causes it . </S>",
    "<S> we precise the statistical relationship between temperature chaos and the free - energy changes upon varying boundary conditions . </S>"
