    "if the ground field is @xmath14 , the complex numbers , one has the basic ( genus @xmath15 ) :    * theorem 1.2 : * _ let @xmath4 have degree @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath4 is stable @xmath16 , for some irreducible representation @xmath17 . _",
    "this is due to narasimhan - seshadri .",
    "note that @xmath18 is a principal @xmath19 fibration , where @xmath20 is the upper - half plane .",
    "any @xmath21 gives a vector bundle of rank @xmath22 on @xmath23 .",
    "* remark 1.3 : * it follows from theorem 1.2 that if @xmath4 is a semistable bundle on a curve @xmath5 over @xmath14 , then @xmath24 , in fact any bundle induced from @xmath4 is again semistable . by lefschetz , this holds for any algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath2 .",
    "* remark 1.4 : * in general , a subbundle @xmath7 of a vector bundle @xmath4 is a reduction of the structure group of the principal bundle of @xmath4 to a maximal parabolic of @xmath25 .",
    "this is in turn equivalent to a section @xmath26 of the associated fibre space : @xmath27 now let @xmath5 be a smooth curve and @xmath28 a principal @xmath1-bundle on @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is a semisimple ( or even a reductive ) group in any characteristic .",

    "we shall examine some conditions when this does hold , and also discuss some applications to the moduli spaces of principal @xmath1-bundles on curves .",
    "-5 mm    here we introduce the basic notion of a low height representation in characteristic @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a representation of @xmath1 in char @xmath0 , @xmath1 being reductive .",
    "fix a borel @xmath42 and a torus @xmath43 in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath44 , be the simple @xmath1-modules occurring in the jordan - holder filtration of @xmath4 .",
    "write each @xmath45 as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the system of simple roots corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath48 .",
    "define @xmath49 .",
    "then one has the basic [ 9,20 ] :    * definition 2.1 : * _ @xmath50 is a low - height representation of @xmath51 or @xmath4 is a low - height module over @xmath1 , if @xmath52 . _    * remark 2.2 : * if @xmath53 , then it easily follows that @xmath4 is a completely reducible @xmath1-module .",
    "in fact for any subgroup @xmath54 of @xmath55 is completely reducible over @xmath56 itself is completely reducible in @xmath1 . by definition ,",

    "these results were proved by serre[20 ] using the notion of a saturated subgroup of @xmath1 .    in general ,",

    "let @xmath64 be a low - height representation .",
    "then the induced bundle @xmath65 is again semistable_.    the proof is an interplay between the results of bogomolov , kempf , rousseau and kirwan in g.i.t . on one hand and the results of serre mentioned earlier on the other .",
    "the group scheme @xmath66 over @xmath5 acts on @xmath67 and assume that @xmath26 is a section of the latter .",
    "consider the generic point @xmath68 of @xmath5 and its algebraic closure @xmath69 . then",

    "@xmath26 is @xmath72 semistable . in this case",
    ", one can easily prove that deg @xmath73 .",
    "2 .   @xmath26 is @xmath74 unstable , i.e. , not semistable .",
    "let @xmath75 be the kempf - rousseau parabolic for @xmath26 , which is defined over @xmath69 . for deg @xmath76 to be @xmath77 it is _ sufficient _ that @xmath75 is defined over @xmath68 .",
    "note that since @xmath4 is a low - height representation of @xmath1 , one has @xmath78 .",
    "one then has ( [ 20 ] ) .",

    "let @xmath83 and assume that @xmath84 lie @xmath85 nilpotent such that @xmath86 lie ( stab @xmath87 .",
    "then in fact one has @xmath86 lie [ stab @xmath88$]_.    along with some facts from @xmath72 , proposition 2.5 enables us to prove that @xmath75 is in fact defined over @xmath68 , thus finishing the sketch of the proof of theorem 2.3 .",
    "see also ramanathan - ramanan [ 19 ] .",
    "one application of low - height representations is in the proof of a conjecture of behrend on the rationality of the canonical parabolic or the instability parabolic .",
    "if @xmath4 is a nonsemistable bundle on a variety @xmath5 , then one can show that there exists a flag @xmath89 , @xmath90 of subbundles of @xmath4 with the properties :    1 .",
    "each @xmath91 is semistable and @xmath92 .",
    "the flag @xmath89 as in ( 1 ) is unique and infinitesimally unique , i.e. , @xmath89 is defined over any field of definition of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "such a flag corresponds to a reduction to a parabolic @xmath31 of @xmath93 and properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) may be expressed as follows : the _ elementary _ vector bundles on @xmath5 associated to @xmath31 all have positive degree and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "one may ask whether there is a such a canonical reduction for a nonsemistable principal @xmath1 bundle @xmath97 .",
    "such a reduction was first asserted first by ramanathan [ 18 ] , and then by atiyah - bott[1 ] , both over @xmath14 and both without proofs .",
    "it was behrend [ 5 ] , who first proved the existence and uniqueness of the canonical reduction to the instability parabolic in all characteristics .",
    "further , behrend conjectured that @xmath98 .    in characteristic zero",
    ", one can check that all three definitions of the instability parabolic coincide and that behrend s conjecture is valid . in characteristic @xmath0 ,",
    "one uses low - height representations to show the equality of the three definitions and prove behrend s conjecture [ 14 ] .",
    "* theorem 2.6 : * _ let @xmath97 be a nonsemistable principal @xmath1-bundle in char @xmath0 .",
    "assume that @xmath99 .",
    "then all the 3 definitions coincide and further we have @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath31 is the instability parabolic_. + theorem 2.6 is useful , among other things , for classifying principal @xmath1-bundles on @xmath102 and @xmath103 in characteristic @xmath0 .",
    "+ if @xmath4 is a finite - dimensional representation of a semisimple group @xmath1 ( in any characteristic ) , then the g.i.t .",
    "quotient @xmath104 parametrizes the closed orbits in @xmath4 .",
    "now , let the characteristic be zero and let @xmath105 have a closed orbit .",
    "then luna s tale slice theorem says that @xmath106 a locally closed non - singular subvariety @xmath107 of @xmath4 such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 is isomorphic to @xmath104 , locally at @xmath110 , in the tale topology . here @xmath111 is the stabilizer of @xmath110 .",
    "the proof uses the fact that @xmath111 is a reductive subgroup of @xmath1 ( not necessarily connected ! ) , hence @xmath4 is a completely reducible @xmath1 module . in characteristic @xmath0 , one has to assume that @xmath4 is a low - ht representation of @xmath1 .",
    "then the conclusion of luna s tale slice theorem is still valid : to be more precise , let @xmath4 be a low - ht representation of @xmath1 and let @xmath105 have a closed orbit . put @xmath20 = stab @xmath112 .",
    "the essential point , as in characteristic 0 , is to prove the complete reducibility of @xmath4 over @xmath20 . using the low - ht assumption",
    ", one shows that every @xmath113 with @xmath5 nilpotent can be integrated to a homomorphism @xmath114 with tangent vector @xmath5 .",
    "now , under the hypothesis of low - ht , one shows that @xmath115 is a saturated subgroup of @xmath1 and @xmath116 is prime to @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that @xmath4 is a completely reducible @xmath115 module .",
    "further , one shows that @xmath115 is a normal subgroup of @xmath20 with @xmath117 a finite group of multiplicative type , i.e. a finite subgroup of a torus .",
    "now the complete reducibility of @xmath4 over @xmath20 follows easily [ 11 ] .",
    "just as in characteristic zero , one deduces the existence of a smooth @xmath20-invariant subvariety @xmath107 of @xmath4 such that @xmath108 and @xmath118 is locally isomorphic to @xmath119 at @xmath110 . this result is used in the construction of the moduli space @xmath120 to be described in the next section .",
    "-5 mm    the moduli spaces of semistable @xmath1-bundles on curves were first constructed by ramanathan over @xmath14 [ 16,17 ] , then by faltings and balaji - seshadri in characteristic 0 [ 3,6 ] .",
    "there are 3 main points in ramanathan s construction :    1 .",
    "if @xmath97 is semistable , then the adjoint bundle @xmath121 is semistable .",
    "2 .   if @xmath97 is polystable , then @xmath121 is also polystable .",
    "a semisimple lie algebra in char 0 is rigid .",
    "the construction of @xmath120 in char @xmath0 was carried out in [ 2,15 ] .",
    "we describe the method of [ 15 ] first : points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are handled by theorem 2.3 and the following [ 11 ] :    * theorem 3.1 : * _ let @xmath97 be a polystable @xmath1-bundle over a curve in char @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath122 be a representation such that all the exterior powers @xmath123 , are low - height representations .",
    "then the induced bundle @xmath124 is also polystable_.    the proof uses luna s tale slice theorem in char @xmath0 and theorem 2.3 .",
    "now one takes a total family @xmath43 of semistable @xmath1 bundle on @xmath5 and takes the good quotient of @xmath43 to obtain @xmath120 in char @xmath0 .",
    "theorem 3.1 is used to identify the closed points of @xmath120 as the isomorphism classes of polystable @xmath1-bundles , just as in char 0 .",
    "the semistable reduction theorem is proved by lifting to characteristic 0 and then applying ramanathan s proof ( in which ( 3 ) above plays a crucial role ) .",
    "this construction follows ramanathan very closely and , as is clear , one has to make low - height assumptions as in theorem 3.1 .",
    "the method of [ 2 ] follows the one in [ 3 ] with some technical and conceptual changes .",
    "one chooses an embedding @xmath125 and a representation @xmath7 for @xmath61 such that ( 1 ) @xmath1 is the stabilizer of some @xmath126 . ( 2 ) @xmath7 is a `` low separable index representation '' of @xmath61 , i.e. , all stabilizers are reduced and @xmath7 is low - height over @xmath61 .",
    "the semistable reduction theorem is proved using the theory of bruhat - tits . here",
    "also suitable low - height assumptions have to be made .",
    "-5 mm    we first discuss the singularities of @xmath120 , assuming throughout that @xmath1 is simply connected . in char 0 , @xmath120 has rational singularities , this follows from boutot s theorem . in char",
    "@xmath0 , the following theorem due to hashimoto [ 8 ] is relevant :      strongly @xmath3-regularity is a notion in the theory of tight closure in commutative algebra .",
    "we just note that if a geometric domain is strongly @xmath3-regular then it is normal , cohen - macaulay , @xmath3-split and has `` rational - like '' singularities .",
    "now let @xmath129 be the `` worst point '' , i.e. , the trivial @xmath1-bundle on @xmath5 .",
    "the local ring @xmath130 is isomorphic to @xmath131 , where @xmath7 = direct sum of @xmath6 copies of @xmath132 , with @xmath1 acting diagonally .",
    "if @xmath0 is a good prime for @xmath1 , then hashimoto s theorem implies that @xmath133 is strongly @xmath3-regular .",
    "the other points of @xmath120 are not so well understood .",
    "this would require a detailed study of the automorphism groups of polystable bundles , both in char 0 and @xmath0 , and of their invariants of the slice representations .",
    "this is necessary also to study the specialization problem , i.e. , when @xmath120 in char 0 specializes to @xmath120 in char @xmath0 .",
    "one has to show that the invariants of the slice representations in char 0 specialize to the invariants in char @xmath0 .",
    "however for @xmath1=sl(n),the situation is much simpler .",
    "one can write down the automorphism group of a polystable bundle and its representation on the local moduli space .",
    "consequently , one expects the moduli spaces to specialize correctly and that the local rings of @xmath120 are strongly @xmath3-regular in all positive characteristics .",
    "now let @xmath5 be a normal , cohen - macaulay variety in char 0 .",
    "it is proved in [ 13],in response to a conjecture of karen smith , that if @xmath5 has rational singularities , then the reduction of @xmath5 mod @xmath0 is @xmath3-rational for all large @xmath0 .",
    "this result together with 1 and 2 above imply that @xmath120 reduced mod @xmath0 is @xmath3-split for all large @xmath0 .",
    "we can not give effective bounds on the primes involved .",
