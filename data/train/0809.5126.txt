    "the experimental evidence for the oscillation of the neutrino clearly showed that the neutrino is a finite - mass particle .",
    "anyway , two big questions concerning the neutrino are still unsolved : its nature ( dirac or majorana ) and the absolute value of its mass .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay ( 0@xmath4dbd ) is , at present , one of the most sensitive method to study the neutrino properties .",
    "today bolometers are those detectors , together with germanium diodes , which have provided the best results within this kind of research .",
    "the choice of the so - called calorimetric approach , where the detector is composed of the same material candidate to the decay , allows the study of many isotopes and has an excellent energy resolution ( fwhm around 0.2 - 0.5 % at 2800 kev ) , which is necessary to solve the peak looked for from background .",
    "the purpose of the experiments of the so - called new generation is to reach a sensitivity on the mass of the neutrino in the order of about 50 mev , crucial to confirm or exclude the inverse hierarchy of the mass of the neutrinos .",
    "the high sensitivity requests imply excellent energetic resolutions , a low number of spurious counts within the region of interest and a high quantity of the isotope on which the study focuses .",
    "new generation experiments , such as cuore @xcite , are now starting the construction phase .",
    "further improvements should not rely only on the mass increase but on the possibility of background discrimination .",
    "the only way of improving drastically the sensitivity is to add background rejection tools to the present high resolution large mass detectors . in the case of a scintillating bolometer",
    "the double independent read - out ( heat and scintillation ) will allow , thanks to the different scintillation quenching factor ( qf ) between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the suppression of the background events due to @xmath6 particles .",
    "furthermore , using a scintillating bolometer containing a dbd emitter whose transition energy exceeds the natural 2615 kev gamma line of @xmath0tl such as @xmath2cd ( q@xmath8 @xmath9 2805 kev ) it is possible to reach extremely low levels of background .",
    "moreover , this technique is also extremely helpful for rejecting other unavoidable sources of background such as direct interactions of neutrons .",
    "the possibility to study rare events such as 0@xmath4dbd is strongly influenced by the background in the region of interest of the energy spectrum .",
    "there are various sources that give rise to these spurious counts such as environmental @xmath7 radioactivity , cosmic rays , neutrons , radon and contamination of materials which detectors and their shielding are made of .",
    "the experimental signature of the 0@xmath4dbd is a peak at the q@xmath8 value of the transition , the rarity of the process makes its identification difficult .",
    "consequently , the main task of 0@xmath4dbd research is the background suppression using ultra - low background techniques and , hopefully , identifying the signal .",
    "there are different sources of background for dbd experiments that can be classified in five main categories .    _",
    "* external gamma background * _    the @xmath7 background comes mainly from natural contaminations in @xmath10u and @xmath11th of the materials that surround the detectors .",
    "the common highest gamma line is the 2615 kev line of @xmath0tl form the @xmath11th decay chain . above this energy",
    "there are only extremely rare high energy @xmath7 from @xmath12bi .",
    "it is therefore clear that a detector based on an dbd emitter with the q@xmath8 value above the 2615 kev line of @xmath0tl represents the optimal starting point for a future experiment .",
    "the most interesting double beta decay nuclei are shown in fig .",
    "[ dbd_candidate ] .    _ * neutrons * _    low energy neutrons produced by environmental radioactivity can induce ( n , @xmath7 ) reactions in materials close to or inside the detectors with gamma energies up to 10 mev ; furthermore , high energy neutrons generated by @xmath13-induced spallation reactions can release several mev by direct interaction in the detectors .",
    "_ * surface contaminations * _    this source of background plays a role in almost all detectors but turns out to be crucial for fully active detectors , as in the case of bolometers : a radioactive nuclei located within few @xmath13 m of a surface facing the detector can emit an @xmath6 particle ( whose energy is , in most of the cases , between 4 and 8 mev ) .",
    "this particles can loose part , or even all , of their energy in the few micron of this dead layer before reaching the bolometer .",
    "the energy spectra read by the bolometer , therefore , will result in a continuum between 0 and 4 - 8 mev , covering , unfortunately all the possible q@xmath8 values .",
    "furthermore , the same mechanism holds in the case of surface contaminations in the bolometer itself .",
    "this @xmath6-induced background represents the main source of background for the cuoricino experiment @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the measure of these surface contaminations can not be carried out with standard devices , since the requested sensitivities are more than one order of magnitude smaller @xcite with respect to the ones available by the best commercial detectors ( namely high purity silicon barrier detectors ) .    _",
    "* @xmath10u and @xmath11th internal contaminations * _    this source of background has to be considered very carefully for non - homogeneous ( or passive ) detectors , while , under certain assumptions , does not play a significant role for homogeneous detectors ( ge - diodes and bolometers ) .",
    "@xmath6 decays , in fact , will produce the full energy peak , well above the most interesting @xmath14 values .",
    "all the dangerous @xmath15 - @xmath7 events of these two radioactive chains , on the other hand , can be recognized through delayed @xmath6 coincidences .",
    "if we discard the contribution of @xmath16pa of the @xmath10u chain , that has @xmath15 - @xmath7 events with q@xmath17=2195 kev ( extremely dangerous for germanium experiments ) , all the remaining high energy decays are shown in fig .",
    "[ beta_gamma ] . as can be argued by the scheme ,",
    "the @xmath15 - @xmath7 decays are preceded ( or followed ) by an @xmath6 emission .",
    "therefore , using delayed @xmath6 coincidences , @xmath15 - @xmath7 decays , that can mimic the 2 electron signal , are discarded .",
    "this technique can be easily applied for the @xmath10u decay chain , while may have some problems ( dead time ) with the @xmath0tl decay : in this case the decay is preceded by the @xmath6 of @xmath18bi with a mean time given by t@xmath19=3.05 m ; it is therefore clear that this method holds only if the internal contamination of @xmath11th is not too large .    _ * cosmogenic activity * _    copper represents the cleanest solid material available and , for this reason , is often used for internal radioactive shielding in several dbd and dark matter experiments .",
    "unfortunately @xmath20co the best known cosmogenic isotope , is a common contaminant in copper .",
    "moreover , cosmogenic activity can affect not only the surrounding shielding materials but also the detector itself .",
    "for what concerns internal @xmath20co contamination the background spectrum is due to the beta decay ( q@xmath21 = 2824 kev ) while regarding external contaminations the background is mostly due to the 2 @xmath7 s ( 1173 kev + 1332 kev ) emitted in coincidence , with a total energy of 2505 kev .",
    "a scintillating bolometer is , in principle , a very simple device .",
    "it is composed by a bolometer ( a massive scintillating crystal coupled with a thermometer ) and a suitable light detector ( ld ) , faced to it , able to measure the emitted photons ( see fig . [ bol_scint ] ) .",
    "the driving idea of this hybrid detector is to combine the two information available : the energy released in the crystal absorber ( heat ) and emitted scintillation light .",
    "thanks to the different scintillation yield ( or scintillation quenching factor , qf ) of different particles ( namely @xmath15 - @xmath7 , @xmath6 and neutrons ) they can be very efficiently discriminated .",
    "the first light / heat measurement with @xmath6 background discrimination for dbd searches was performed with a thermal bolometer and a silicon photodiode by our group in 1992 @xcite but was no more pursued due to the difficulties of running such a light detector at low temperatures ( @xmath22 10 mk ) . the idea to use a bolometer as light detector",
    "was first developed @xcite and then optimized @xcite for dark matter ( dm ) searches .",
    "starting from that work we developed a thermal light detector to be used for dbd search . in the years between 2003 and 2007 we performed different measurements in order to optimize the light detector and to test different kind of primary crystals . in april 2005",
    "we tested a 3@xmath233@xmath232 @xmath24 , 140 g cdwo@xmath5 single crystal for 417 hours of live time .",
    "this measurement gave very good results @xcite and we decided to do new measurements with such a kind of detectors .",
    "the temperature rise in a bolometer is directly proportional to the energy deposition ( e ) in the detector and inversely proportional to the heat capacity of the crystal ( @xmath25 t @xmath26 e / c ) .",
    "this means that in a detector with a small heat capacitance ( @xmath26 mass ) even a small energy release ( i.e. the absorption of few photons ) can result in a measurable temperature rise .",
    "obviously the absorber of the light detector have to be dark to the scintillaton light .",
    "normally the light detector is constituted by a crystal of ge or si .",
    "some further points need to be made : the bolometric light detector is , actually , a bolometer .",
    "this means that it has the characteristic time constant of bolometers ( 20 - 500 ms ) .",
    "certainly , large - surface bolometric light detectors can not easily reach the threshold of pmts ( @xmath27 1 photoelectron , i.e. , 3 - 7 photons , taking into account the quantum efficiency conversion ) , but they have two important advantages : first of all , they are sensitive over an extremely large band of photon wavelength ( depending on the absorber ) and , secondly , the overall quantum efficiency can be as good as the one of photodiodes .",
    "this means that the energy resolution on the scintillating light , which depends ( above threshold ) only on the poisson statistical fluctuation of the emitted photons , will be better for bolometric light detectors with respect to pmts .",
    "the main characteristics of a bolometric light detector should be easy expandability up to @xmath28 1000 channels and complete reliability of the composed device ( bolometer + light detector ) in order to have an almost 100% live time measurement .",
    "on the other hand , there is not the need to have an extremely sensitive detector , as in the case of dark matter searches , since the dbd signal lies in the mev range .",
    "this makes the construction and the operation of such devices extremely easier with respect to the ones developed for dm searches .",
    "the small size of the light detectors ( usually thicknesses @xmath291 mm ) does nt allow to calibrate the detector with external sources .",
    "for this reason a dedicated measurement was performed with a calibration source ( @xmath30fe ) facing the light detector .",
    "figure [ fe55 ] shows the obtained calibration spectrum .",
    "thanks to the excellent energy resolution of these detectors ( fwhm = 250 ev at 6 kev ) it s possible to observe the peaks at @xmath275.9 kev and at @xmath276.5 kev due to the x rays of the calibration source .",
    "at the beginning of april 2008 an array of 5 cdwo@xmath5 crystals was tested for the first time .",
    "the array consists of a plane of four 3@xmath233@xmath233 @xmath3 crystals and a second plane consisting of a single 3@xmath233@xmath236 @xmath3 crystal ( fig .",
    "[ expset ] ) .",
    "the four detectors are coupled to the same light detector ( a ge disc of 66 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness ) that collects the scintillation light of all the crystals .",
    "a different , smaller , dedicated detector ( a ge disc of 35 mm diameter and 0.3 mm thickness ) is used to measure the scintillation light of the large 3@xmath233@xmath236 @xmath3 cdwo@xmath5 crystal .",
    "table [ tab : boltechdata ] reports the crystals technical data .",

    "the cryostat is surrounded by about 20 cm of lead in order to reduce environmental @xmath7 radioactivity .",
    "furthermore , the crystal set - up was mounted below about 5.5 cm of roman lead and inside a new roman lead shield , framed inside the 50 mk thermal shield of the cryostat , in order to further decrease the environmental background .",
    "detectors are also surrounded by about 7 cm of polyethylene ( ch@xmath34 ) to thermalize fast neutrons and about 1 cm of cb@xmath1 that , thanks to the high neutron capture cross section for thermal neutrons of @xmath35b , allows to reduce neutron flux on the detectors .",
    "the temperature sensors are neutron transmutation doped ge thermistors of 3@xmath231.3@xmath230.5 mm@xmath36 thermally coupled to each crystal with 6 epoxy glue spots ( @xmath270.6 mm diameter ) .",
    "a resistor of @xmath27300 k@xmath37 , realized with a heavily doped meander on a 1 mm@xmath36 silicon chip , is attached to each crystal and acts as a heater to stabilize the gain of the bolometer @xcite .",
    "the crystal holder is mechanically decoupled from the cryostat in order to avoid vibrations from the cryogenic facility inducing noise on the detectors @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the crystal holder is stabilized through an especially designed feedback device @xcite .",
    "the read - out of the thermistors is performed through a cold ( @xmath27110 k ) preamplifier stage located inside the cryostat @xcite .",
    "the room temperature front - end @xcite and the second stage of amplification are located on the top of the cryostat .",
    "after the second stage , and close to the acquisition system , there is an antialiasing filter ( a 6 pole roll - off active bessel filter ) .",
    "the adc is a ni usb device ( 16 bit 40 differential input channels ) located in a small faraday cage .",
    "the connection to the acquisition pc is made through an usb optical decoupler in order to avoid ground loops .",
    "the signals ( software triggered ) are sampled in a 128 ms window with sampling rate of 4 khz .",
    "the data analysis is completely performed off - line .",
    "calibration of cdwo@xmath5 crystals is made with two removable ( @xmath11th ) sources : one source placed outside the cryostat and the other one placed inside the internal roman lead shield ( @xmath28 3 cm from the detectors ) in order to be able to detect also low energy gamma lines .",
    "in fig . [ scatter ] the heat versus light scatter plot of one detector is shown .",
    "data relates to the 3@xmath233@xmath236 @xmath3 cdwo@xmath5 detector with a mass of about 426 g and a live time of @xmath27 1066 h. this plot shows how it is possible to separate very well the background due to @xmath6 particles from the @xmath15/@xmath7 region . in particular it should be noted that @xmath6 continuum is completely ruled out thanks to the combined measurement of heat and scintillation . in the region above the 2615 kev line @xmath15/@xmath7 events have not been observed , demonstrating the power of this technique . moreover , in the @xmath6 region it is possible to observe peaks due to internal contamination that can be attributed to natural radioactive decay chains and the @xmath38w @xmath6 peak at about 2516 kev . it can be observed , from fig .",
    "[ scatter ] , a strange behaviour of some @xmath6 peaks : some lines are tilted with some events showing less scintillation light .",
    "these events are probably due to surface events . in fact",
    "this characteristic is evident in the 5304 kev @xmath6 of @xmath39po .",
    "the events belonging to that curve are certainly surface events .",
    "probably the efficency in the light collection is not optimized for these kind of events .",
    "furthermore , the internal @xmath38w @xmath6 line do not show at all this feature .",
    "due to the fact that there are no counts in the 0@xmath4dbd region we made some simulation with geant4 @xcite package in order to estimate the achievable background in this configuration .",
    "in the 0@xmath4dbd region for @xmath2cd the main source of @xmath7 background due to external contamination is induced by the @xmath0tl decay .",
    "in fact , if contaminations are sufficiently close to the detectors , probability of spurious counts due to coincidences betwen 2615 kev and 583 kev gamma emitted in the @xmath0tl decay are not negligible . simulating contaminations ( @xmath11th decay chain ) in the copper structure surrounding the detectors we obtained that for a contamination of 0.89 pg / g ( limit obtained with neutron activation analysis ( naa ) ) the limit on the background in the 3@xmath233@xmath236 @xmath3 cdwo@xmath5 crystal due to this main contribution is 1.2@xmath2310@xmath40 counts / kev / kg / y in the 0@xmath4dbd region .",
    "the four 3@xmath233@xmath233 @xmath3 cdwo@xmath5 crystals have shown internal contaminations larger than those observed in 3@xmath233@xmath236 @xmath3 cdwo@xmath5 crystals .",
    "this implies the appearance of some counts in the @xmath15 region above 2.7 mev due to the @xmath15 decay of @xmath0tl ( q@xmath21 @xmath9 5001 kev ) .",
    "simulations for internal contaminations of crystals , normalized to the @xmath6 peaks measured , reproduce the behaviour well .",
    "we are performing a more detailed analysis in order to recognize and remove all this spurious counts through the recognition of delayed @xmath6 coincidences mentioned above .",
    "we have shown that light detection allows to identify the @xmath6 - induced background in scintillating bolometers .",
    "however , this technique is also extremely helpful for rejecting other unavoidable source of background that can appear in thermal detectors such as rare heat releases induced by material relaxations @xcite and neutrons .",
    "we performed , on five large double beta decay scintillating crystals , simultaneous detection of heat and light showing directly the feasibility and the reliability of this technique . for the first time we tested an array of four cdwo@xmath5 double beta decay scintillating bolometers read by only one light detector .",
    "the live time of the background measurement was close to 93 % , demonstrating the reliability of the overall setup .",
    "the background that can be obtained with such detectors , because the q@xmath8 of @xmath2cd of 2805 kev exceeds the natural 2615 kev gamma line of @xmath0tl , can easily reach levels at least of @xmath2710@xmath40 counts / kev / kg / y , about 3 orders of magnitude better with respect to the present experiments , such as cuoricino @xcite .    00 c. arnaboldi _",
