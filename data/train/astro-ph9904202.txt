    "this is the second of two papers describing the results of surveys examining the properties of planetary nebulae ( pne ) as observed in the near - infrared ( @xmath6 ) . the first paper ( latter et al .",
    "1995 ; hereafter paper i ) presented an infrared imaging survey ; here we present the results of a near - infrared spectral survey .",
    "there are several reasons why knowledge of the near - infrared ( near - ir ) characteristics of pne is important , as described in paper i. in order to interpret the imaging results and to learn more about the physical conditions in the nebulae , the spectra of these objects must be examined to understand the processes responsible for the emission .",
    "there are many emission lines present in the 1  2.5  spectral region , most notably those due to recombination lines of , and lines of vibrationally excited 2 . also present",
    "are atomic lines of and [ ] , and emission from other molecular species such as co and c@xmath2 .",
    "these lines can act as diagnostic tools to probe the physical conditions inside the nebula , sampling different regions and ranges of temperature , density , and excitation than is seen by observing the optical line emission .",
    "some pne also exhibit in the near - ir strong continuum emission from hot dust .",
    "this emission becomes significant longward of @xmath7  in many of the pne , requiring near - ir spectroscopy to detect it and to differentiate between line and continuum emission sources .",
    "finally , the lower optical depth of the pne in the ir as compared to optical wavelengths allows us to potentially see into regions of the nebula that are obscured by dust .",
    "there have been several previous surveys that have explored the properties of pne in the infrared .",
    "early spectroscopic and photometric surveys ( e.g. , gillett , merrill , & stein 1972 ; cohen & barlow 1974 ) determined that there was an excess of ir emission over what was expected from reflected continuum emission from the central star .",
    "other photometric surveys in the following years ( whitelock 1985 ; persi et al .",
    "1987 ) determined the primary sources of ir emission to be stellar continuum , thermal dust emission , and thermal & line emission from the nebula itself .",
    "the near - ir color characteristics of most pne are unique and can be used to identify new pne and post - agb objects ( garcia - lario et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "recently there have been more detailed spectral observations of pne in the near - ir .",
    "hrivnak , kwok , & geballe ( 1994 ) surveyed a set of proto - pne in the h and k bands . in these objects",
    "the brackett lines were observed in absorption , and most objects had co absorption or emission , indicating recent mass loss events .",
    "rudy et al .",
    "( 1992 , and references therein ) and kelly & latter ( 1995 ) have surveyed several pne and proto - pne in the @xmath8  range .",
    "dinerstein & crawford ( 1998 ) have completed a survey of a set of pne in the k - band , focusing on excitation of molecular hydrogen .",
    "there are several unique aspects of the survey results presented here that were made possible by the kspec spectrograph ( see the instrument description below ) .",
    "first , because of kspec s high sensitivity and simultaneous sampling of the full near - infrared spectral range , we were able to obtain data on a comparatively large number of objects ( 41 ) in a short period of time . using the relatively narrow and short slit of the spectrograph , we sampled different regions of the pne to examine the emission throughout the nebula . in most of the other surveys described above , larger beams were used that included much or all of the object .",
    "another aspect of the data presented here is because of the cross - dispersed design of the instrument , the entire @xmath9  range is obtained at once , eliminating the possibility of telescope pointing errors or other fluctuations affecting the relative line strengths in the spectra . finally , the slit - viewing detector allowed precise positioning and guiding , so the region of the pn being observed was well known for each spectrum .",
    "the pne observed in this survey were chosen to overlap with the near - ir imaging survey ( paper i ) , along with several other optically - bright pne and unresolved objects that were not included in the imaging survey .",
    "the observations were performed on several runs during the period 1992 october through 1994 september at the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope on mauna kea , using the near - ir kspec spectrograph ( hodapp et al .",
    "kspec is a @xmath6  cross - dispersed spectrograph that has a separate slit - viewing ir array for acquiring the source and guiding .",
    "the full spectral range is obtained in a single exposure , resulting in accurate relative line measurements and highly efficient data acquisition .",
    "the diffraction orders are well - matched to the atmospheric transmission windows , with the k band in 3rd order ( 1.9  2.5 ) , h in 4th order ( 1.45  1.8 ) and j in 5th order ( 1.15  1.32 ) , with a resolution r @xmath0 700 .",
    "the 1@xmath106 arcsecond slit provides a small aperture that was used to sample different spatial regions of the nebula to search for spectral variations .",
    "table 1 lists the nebulae observed and details of the observations .",
    "integration times for each exposure ranged from a few seconds for the extremely bright sources to 5 minutes for faint sources .",
    "the off - axis guider was used to keep a consistent on - source slit position .",
    "multiple `` fowler '' sampling was used to reduce the read noise . the number of samples for a particular integration ranged from 4 to 16 , with more samples used for the longer integration times .",
    "the spectra were reduced using iraf ; the extraction and processing of the spectral data were done using the functions in the noao.twodspec and noao.onedspec packages .",
    "alternating source and sky integrations of the same length were taken and differenced to remove sky and telescope background flux .",
    "dome flats were used to correct for pixel - to - pixel gain variations in the array .",
    "stars of known spectral type ( either g0 or a0 ) were observed at the same airmass as the nebulae immediately before and after the pne observations and were used for correction of the instrumental response and sky transmission .",
    "individual lines were removed from the stellar spectra , and then normalized using a blackbody function of t = 5920 k for the g0 stars and t = 10800 k for the a0 standards .",
    "the spectra were wavelength - calibrated using observations of an argon reference lamp .",
    "the wavelength values used for lines greater than 1.1  are from rao et al .",
    "( 1966 ) ; for lines less than 1.1 , the wavelengths were taken from wiese , smith , & miles ( 1969 ) and corrected to vacuum wavelengths .",
    "the average 1@xmath11 uncertainty in the measured wavelengths of the lines is about 5  .",
    "infrared photometric standard stars were observed in the same way as the pne and used to flux calibrate the spectra .",
    "absolute calibration is difficult with these spectra because not all of the flux from the star enters the narrow slit during a single integration , and the amount differs for each integration depending on how well the star is centered on the slit ( the seeing at 2  during typical observations was 05  10 ) .",
    "the amount of light lost was estimated by the following method : the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) brightness of the standard star was measured along the spatial direction of the slit , in the spectrum with maximum flux for that star .",
    "it was then assumed that the point spread function ( psf ) is well represented by a two - dimensional gaussian distribution with the measured fwhm , and the amount of flux falling outside of the slit was then calculated .",
    "this was typically 20  30% of the total light for a single integration .",
    "the calibration for each star was corrected by this factor , along with corrections for airmass . comparing results from different standard",
    "stars taken throughout the night indicated that this method is accurate to approximately 20% .",
    "for the observations of the pne , no correction was applied for the slit width or length .",
    "the length along the slit of the extracted regions for the three bands were 20 ( j ) , 35 ( h ) , and 40 ( k ) .",
    "the spectra are presented in figures 1  32 .",
    "one to three pne spectra are plotted in each figure .",
    "tables 2 through 7 list the line identifications and extracted fluxes with uncertainties for the spectra shown in the figures .",
    "the pn in this section are listed in tables 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "there are a number of features not identified ( indicated by question marks in the tables ) .",
    "these features tend to appear above the @xmath12 level and must be considered real , though confirming spectra would be valuable .",
    "our search for possible identifications for these lines has been careful , but perhaps not exhaustive .",
    "in addition to the relatively low s / n of these lines , the moderate wavelength resolution is not sufficient to differentiate between the several possible identifications for each line .",
    "the pne spectra are separated into four groups that share common characteristics .",
    "these are recombination line - dominated , recombination line + 2  emission , 2   dominated , and continuum - dominated .",
    "a fifth group of objects is included that contains two objects that were at one time classified as pne , but are now generally regarded as being regions ( m 178 and k 445 ; acker et al.1992 ) .",
    "we do not discuss these objects further , but include them for comparison . within each group ,",
    "the ngc objects are listed first , followed by the remaining pne in alphanumeric order .",
    "the morphological classifications are given according to balick ( 1987 ) , unless otherwise noted .",
    "these are young pne or ppne that have strong warm dust continuum and little line emission .",
    "the strongest component is in general the core , with most of the emission from an unresolved point source . in some of the nebulae",
    ", emission structure extends a few arcseconds from the core region .",
    "also , in objects such as afgl 915 , they are associated with larger optical nebulae that extend arcminutes from the core . in this survey , only the regions near the core were sampled .",
    "afgl 915 ( the `` red rectangle '' ) is a carbon - rich biconical reflection nebula with a metal - depleted spectroscopic binary at its center ( cohen et al .  1975 ) .",
    "the nebula appears axially symmetric and shows spikes running tangent to the edge of the bicone .",
    "surrounding the post - agb star at its center is a circumbinary disk viewed edge - on ( jura , balm , & kahane 1995 ) which could be oxygen - rich ( waters et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "c@xmath2 and cn are not detected near the binary , though c@xmath2 is present in emission in the reflection lobes .",
    "ch@xmath32 ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,0 ) are detected in emission ( bakker et al .",
    "1997 ; balm & jura 1992 ) .",
    "co is underabundant , with relatively weak emission and broad wings detected ( dayal & bieging 1996 ; greaves & holland 1997 ; loup et al .",
    "1993 ; bujarrabal et al.1992 ) .",
    "glinski et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found co and in the uv in both absorption and emission .",
    "they expect strong co overtone emission in the ir based on their observations of hot co emission and absorption in the uv .",
    "the object shows ere ( extended red emission ) from about @xmath41 to 7200   and a set of emission bands around 5800   ( schmidt , cohen , & margon 1980 ) whose carriers might be the same material as the carriers of the dibs ( diffuse interstellar bands ) .",
    "this object also shows strong emission in the pah bands at 3.3 , 7.7 , and 11.2  ( cohen et al .",
    "1975 ) , which are located predominantly in the lobes and spikes of emission ( bregman et al .  1993 ; hora et al .  1996 ) .",
    "spectra taken at two different positions are shown , one centered on the core , and the other at 4  s of the core .",
    "both show strong warm dust continuum , and the core also has strong co bandhead emission features in the @xmath42  range .",
    "10420 is a highly evolved , oh / ir star that is thought to be in a post - red supergiant phase ( jones et al .",
    "the central star seems to have changed spectral type , transitioning recently to an early a type ( oudmaijer 1998 ) .",
    "oudmaijer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) detected several of the hydrogen lines in absorption and emission in the near - ir , and oudmaijer ( 1998 ) presented a high - resolution 0.38  1  spectrum showing a large number of emission and absorption lines .",
    "recent hst imaging by humphreys et al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows that the circumstellar environment around this star is extremely complex , with spherical outer shells that extend to a diameter of 6 arcseconds , and several inner condensations . in the near- and mid - infrared , bipolar lobes",
    "are visible that extend @xmath43 arcseconds from the core .",
    "the spectrum of 10420 shown in figure 31 was taken centered on the object .",
    "the slit length includes the inner few arcseconds of the object , although it is dominated by the bright core .",
    "the observed spectrum shows a bright and relatively featureless continuum .",
    "some lines , e.g. , , are seen in absorption .",
    "the ppn m 256 is a bipolar nebula with a bright central core .",
    "it is similar in morphology to afgl 618 , although it seems to be at an earlier evolutionary stage since it does not appear to have an region ( trammell , dinerstein , & goodrich 1993 ; goodrich 1991 ) .",
    "the spectrum of m 256 shown in figure 31 was taken centered on the core of this ppn .",
    "the dominant feature is a hot dust continuum that is most prominent in the k band region of the spectrum .",
    "there are some residual features in the spectrum from imperfect sky subtraction , mostly in the k band .",
    "the pne spectra presented in this paper were grouped according to spectral characteristics as described above .",
    "the groups are an efficient way to present the data , but also can be seen to correlate strongly with other characteristics of the pn .",
    "the group of - line dominated pne is composed of primarily elliptical or round pne , along with the peculiar or irregular nebulae of the sample . in general",
    "these pne are well - known from optical studies , identified either by their morphology or their optical spectra .",
    "many of the pne in this group of the sample , however , do have ir `` excess '' continuum emission from warm dust , which in some cases prompted their inclusion in this sample .",
    "the spectral groups with molecular and/or dust continuum emission are primarily bipolar .",
    "this classification includes objects such as ngc 6720 which have a ring morphology but are thought to be bipolar viewed pole - on ; hb 12 which is brightest in 2  in the equatorial region and along the outer edges of the lobes ; m 29 which is brightest in 2  at the edges of the lobes with no equatorial emission other than at the core ; and afgl 2688 which is brightest along the axis of the bipolar lobes , with 2emission in the equatorial plane .",
    "clearly this is a heterogeneous group with a wide range of emission and morphological differences that imply a range of evolutionary tracks and states .",
    "carbon stars , although a small fraction of all agb stars , return about half of the total mass injected into the ism by all agb stars , since they have on average much higher mass loss rates ( @xmath44 ) than do o - rich objects . the carbon - to - oxygen ( c / o ) abundance ratio in pne",
    "has previously been shown to correlate with morphology ( zuckerman & aller 1986 ) , with bipolar pne tending to be carbon - rich .",
    "it is therefore expected that the c / o ratio also correlates with the spectral classifications presented here .",
    "this is in general the case , with the - line dominated pne having c / o ratios less than or about 1 , whereas the remaining categories which are dominated by the bipolar pne have c / o ratios @xmath45 1 , as reported by zuckerman & aller ( 1986 ) and rola & stasiska ( 1994 ) .",
    "rola & stasiska discuss problems with previous determinations of the c / o ratio , and use different criteria that result in a slightly lower percentage of carbon - rich pne ( 35% ) than others .",
    "their ratios are used in the discussion below .",
    "the morphology of pn also has been shown to depend on the progenitor mass ( see corradi & schwarz 1995 ) , with the bipolar pn being more massive than other morphological types .",
    "this relationship , along with the link between carbon abundance and morphology , suggests that carbon stars are the progenitors of bipolar pn and those with a large amount of molecular material .",
    "the mechanisms that cause massive carbon - rich stars to preferentially form bipolar pn are still not understood .",
    "there are some exceptions to the correlation of morphological type to c / o ratio ; in particular , ngc 6543 has a much higher value ( 9.55 ) than the others in the class . in the other extreme , ngc",
    "2346 stands out as having a low c / o ratio ( 0.35 ) compared to other bipolar pne in the 2  - dominated group .",
    "this object is a much more evolved object than the others in its group ( e.g. , afgl 2688 ) , and exhibits weak  emission , showing that the ionized gas is present although weak relative to the molecular emission in the nebula .",
    "this survey has differed from many previous investigations in that a short , narrow slit was used to obtain the data , rather than a large beam that could include most or all of the nebula .",
    "because of this , one can not easily use the spectra presented here to model the pne in a global sense , if that requires a measurement of the total flux from the object .",
    "also , if a complete census of emission lines were required , some might be missed if there were variations of emission characteristics across the nebula and certain regions were not sampled .",
    "the spatial selectivity that prevents viewing the entire pn at once , however , has proven to be an advantage when trying to examine various aspects of the pn , including variations across the nebula , as a function of distance from the central star , or in examining certain morphological features .",
    "for example , in m 29 and ngc 2440 , the emission of the lobe walls and emission knots were separately sampled , which showed the large spectral differences in these regions .",
    "this information is important for modeling the structure and formation of the pn .",
    "another reason why the small aperture is useful is that if the emission from a group of lines such as 2  is to be modeled , it is important to compare the emission from a clump of material where the conditions do not vary greatly over its size .",
    "for example , the emission from 2  present very close to the central star in a strong uv field could be quite different from 2emission from the outer parts of the halo .",
    "also , the small slit has aided in detecting weak 2  emission from several pne such as ngc 40 , where detection would have been difficult if the central star and the rest of the nebula could not be excluded from the measurement .",
    "a long - standing problem in the interpretation of 2  emission from interstellar and circumstellar environments is understanding the excitation mechanism .",
    "three fundamental mechanisms are possible .",
    "one is excitation of a near - infrared fluorescence spectrum resulting from a rotational - vibrational cascade in the ground electronic state following electronic excitation by the absorption a uv photon in the lyman and werner bands ( black & van dishoeck 1987 ) .",
    "a second excitation mechanism is collisional excitation in a warm gas ( @xmath46 k ) . while uv excitation in a low density gas produces an easily identifiable spectrum , the level populations",
    "can be driven to produce thermal line ratios when the uv flux is large and densities begin to exceed @xmath47 3 ( sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ) . detailed spectral and morphological analysis are often required to determine an origin of the near - ir spectrum .",
    "a third excitation mechanism is formation of 2  on the surfaces of dust grains and in the gas phase . while potentially important in isolated regions of certain objects",
    ", we do not consider this to be generally important in pne and ppne relative to the other two processes .",
    "this is because molecular formation in pne is relatively slow compared to dissociation rates .    in pne and ppne",
    ", the situation can be complicated by both dominant excitation mechanisms being present simultaneously , and in different forms .",
    "several ways of exciting near - ir 2  emission have been identified as possible : direct thermal excitation in warm gas created behind moderate velocity shocks , direct excitation by uv photons from the hot central star , somewhat indirectly by collisional excitation in warm gas created by rapid grain streaming ( e.g. jura & kroto 1990 ) , and excitation through absorption of photons ( by an accidental resonances with the b@xmath48 @xmath49 p(5 ) and r(6 ) transitions of 2 ) which can be generated in a nearby strong shock ( black & van dishoeck 1987 ) .",
    "the first two mechanisms have been identified in several pne , such as thermal excitation in afgl 2688 ( hora & latter 1994 ; sahai 1998a ) , pure uv excitation in a low density gas around hb 12 ( dinerstein 1988 ; hora & latter 1996 ; luhman & rieke 1996 ) , and uv excitation in a high density gas in m 29 ( hora & latter 1994 ) and ngc 7027 ( graham 1993b ; this paper ) .",
    "a combined spectrum was found from a detailed analysis of afgl 618 ( latter 1992 ; this paper ) . while the form of the excitation might be apparent for these and other objects , it is not always evident what is the source of the warm gas or uv photons .",
    "winds are present in afgl 2688 which could directly heat the gas through shocks , but considerable grain streaming is likely taking place as well ( see jura & kroto 1990 ) .",
    "very fast winds and dissociating shocks are present in afgl 618 , m 29 ( kelly , latter , & hora 1998 ) , and m 116 ( sahai 1994 ; schwarz 1992 ) , and all show clear evidence of uv excitation . in addition , the photon path to the 2  emitting regions is not in a direct line - of - sight to the central star , which for photons coming from the central star suggests scattering in what is a fairly low density medium .",
    "alternatively , we are seeing in each of these objects excitation of 2  at the bipolar lobe walls by uv photons generated within strong shocks produced by the fast winds .",
    "this hypothesis was explored through detailed modeling by latter ( 1992 ) of afgl 618 , but the high relative intensity of the thermally excited emission and poor spatial resolution limited this analysis .",
    "the presence of very fast winds in the lobes of each of these objects , and the presence of uv excited 2  emission at the lobe walls strongly suggests that indirect excitation of the 2  is occurring by interactions with photons generated by wind - produced shocks .",
    "detailed modeling of sensitive , high spatial resolution spectra is required .",
    "it is also evident , in general , that without detailed spectra , 2  is a rather poor diagnostic of overall conditions in pne and ppne .",
    "if we conclude that all of the ways to excite 2  in pne and ppne listed above are present and important , what does this imply for our understanding of these objects and the utility of 2  as a diagnostic ?",
    "it is now well understood that the presence of molecular emission from pne and ppne is tied to the morphology of the objects such that if molecular emission is present , the object has a bipolar morphology ( zuckerman & gatley 1988 ; latter 1996 ; kastner 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "we have argued that 2  emission is excited in multiple ways in pne and ppne .",
    "while special conditions are required for 2 emission to be seen in near - ir spectra , the conditions that drive the excitation are common in all pne and ppne and are not clearly dependent on morphological type .",
    "a conclusion that can be drawn from this argument alone is that molecular material is present in nebulae with a bipolar morphology and a significant amount of molecular material is @xmath50 present in other morphological types .",
    "therefore , objects that have a bipolar morphology must have a dense , high mass envelope in which the molecular material can be shielded and survive dissociation for relatively long times  suggesting a high mass loss rate and a high mass progenitor star . a correlation between bipolar morphology and",
    "high mass progenitor stars has been found by others ( corradi & schwarz 1995 ) .",
    "it is apparent that the presence of 2  emission in a pn is not tied to directly to the morphology , but that the bipolar morphology is intimately related to the density and mass of the circumstellar envelope , and therefore the mass of the progenitor star .",
    "why high mass , high mass loss rate asymptotic giant branch stars shed material in an axisymmetric , not spherical , way remains a mystery .",

    "<S> we present medium - resolution ( r @xmath0 700 ) near - infrared ( @xmath1 ) spectra of a sample of planetary nebulae ( pne ) . </S>",
    "<S> a narrow slit was used which sampled discrete locations within the nebulae ; observations were obtained at one or more positions in the 41 objects included in the survey . the pn spectra fall into one of four general categories : emission line - dominated pne , and 2  emission line pne , 2  emission line - dominated pne , and continuum - dominated pne . </S>",
    "<S> these categories correlate with morphological type , with the elliptical pne falling into the first group , and the bipolar pne primarily in the 2  and continuum emission groups . </S>",
    "<S> the categories also correlate with c / o ratio , with the o - rich objects generally falling into the first group and the c - rich objects in the other groups . </S>",
    "<S> other spectral features were observed in all categories , such as continuum emission from the central star , c@xmath2 , cn , and co emission , and warm dust continuum emission towards the long wavelength end of the spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> molecular hydrogen was detected for the first time in four pne . </S>",
    "<S> an excitation analysis was performed using the 2  line ratios for all of the pn spectra in the survey where a sufficient number of lines were observed . from the near - infrared spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we determined an ortho - to - para ratio , the rotational and vibrational excitation temperatures , and the dominant excitation mechanism of the 2  for many objects surveyed . </S>",
    "<S> one unexpected result from this analysis is that the 2  is excited by absorption of ultraviolet photons in most of the pne surveyed , although for several pne in our survey collisional excitation in moderate velocity shocks plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between bipolar morphology and 2emission has been strengthened with the new detections of 2  in this survey . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the role of winds and photons to the excitation of 2  in pne , and consider some implications to the utility of 2  as a nebular diagnostic and to our understanding of pne structure and evolution .    </S>",
