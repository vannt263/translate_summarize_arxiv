    "quantum bit commitment ( qbc ) @xcite is a two - party cryptography including two phases . in the commit phase , alice ( the sender of the commitment )",
    "decides the value of the bit @xmath0 ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) that she wants to commit , and sends bob ( the receiver of the commitment ) a piece of evidence , e.g. , some quantum states .",
    "later , in the unveil phase , alice announces the value of @xmath0 , and bob checks it with the evidence .",
    "an unconditionally secure qbc protocol needs to be both binding ( i.e. , alice can not change the value of @xmath0 after the commit phase ) and concealing ( bob can not know @xmath0 before the unveil phase ) without relying on any computational assumption .",
    "qbc is recognized as an essential primitive for quantum cryptography , as it is the building block for quantum multi - party secure computations and more complicated post - cold - war eramulti - party cryptographic protocols @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is widely accepted that unconditionally secure qbc is impossible @xcite-@xcite , despite of some attempts toward secure ones ( e.g. , hejpa , hepra , hearxiv , hearxiv2,qbc75,qi92 and the references therein ) .",
    "this result , known as the mayers - lo - chau ( mlc ) no - go theorem , was considered as putting a serious drawback on quantum cryptography .",
    "( note that cheat - sensitive qbc @xcite is not covered , as its security goal is defined differently from that of the qbc studied in the current paper . )",
    "very recently , we proposed a qbc protocol using orthogonal states hejpa , where the density matrices do not satisfy a crucial condition on which the mlc no - go theorem holds .",
    "the protocol is based on the goldenberg - vaidman ( gv ) quantum key distribution ( qkd ) scheme @xcite , which makes use of the mach - zehnder interferometer involving symmetric beam splitters .",
    "koashi and imoto qi917 pointed out that the gv qkd scheme can be simplified by replacing the symmetric beam splitters with asymmetric ones . here",
    "we will apply the same idea to propose a simplified version of our qbc protocol , so that it can be more feasible and efficient .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce some basic notations and settings used throughout the paper .",
    "the koashi - imoto ( ki ) qkd scheme will be briefly reviewed in section iii .",
    "then we propose our qbc protocol in section iv , and analyze its security in section v. the feasibility will be discussed in section vi . section vii summarizes the conclusion and gives some remarks .",
    "an example of the technical attack mentioned in section vi will be provided in the appendix .",
    "generally , in both qkd and qbc the two participants are called alice and bob . but similar to @xcite , in our current qbc protocol , the behavior of bob is more like that of the eavesdropper rather than the bob in qkd . to avoid confusion , here we use the names in the following way . in qkd",
    ", the sender of the secret information is called alice , the receiver is renamed as charlie instead of bob , and the external eavesdropper is called eve . in qbc , the sender of the commitment is alice , the receiver is bob , and there is no eve since qbc merely deals with the cheating from internal dishonest participants , instead of external eavesdropping .    as our main interest is focused on the theoretical possibility of secure qbc",
    ", we will only consider the ideal case where no transmission error occurs in the communication channels , nor there are detection loss or dark counts , etc .",
    "our qbc proposal is inspired by the ki qkd scheme @xcite , which makes use of the mach - zehnder interferometer illustrated in  fig .",
    "1 . let @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the reflectivity and transmissivity of the asymmetric beam splitters @xmath5  and @xmath6 , with @xmath7  and @xmath8 .",
    "alice encodes the bit values @xmath9 and @xmath2 she wants to transmit to charlie , respectively , using two orthogonal states@xmath10here @xmath11 is the @xmath12 photon fock state for the arm @xmath13 .",
    "that is , each @xmath14  or @xmath15  is split into two localized wave packets , and sent to charlie separately in quantum channels @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ; thus single photon nonlocality is presented .",
    "this is done by sending a single photon either from the source @xmath18 ( sending @xmath19 ) or from the source @xmath20 ( sending @xmath21 ) , then splitting it with the beam splitter @xmath5 made of a half - silvered mirror ( note that polarizing beam splitters are not recommended due to the security problem addressed at the end of section 6 of @xcite ) .    to ensure the security of the transmission , the wave packet in channel @xmath17 is delayed by the storage ring @xmath22 , which introduces a sufficiently long delay time @xmath23 so that this wave packet will not leave alice s site until the other wave packet in channel @xmath16 already entered charlie s site .",
    "thus the two wave packets of the same photon are never present together in the transmission channels .",
    "this makes it impossible for eve to prepare and send charlie a perfect clone _ on time _ if she waits to intercept and measure both wave packets , even though @xmath14and @xmath24 are orthogonal , because she has to decide what to resend to channel @xmath16 before she can receive anything from channel @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "when no eavesdropping occurs , charlie can distinguish @xmath14  and @xmath25 unambiguously by adding a storage ring @xmath26 to channel @xmath16 whose delay time is also @xmath23 , while introducing a phase shift @xmath27 to channel @xmath17 .",
    "the two wave packets of the same photon will then recombine and interfere on the beam splitter @xmath6 , which is identical to @xmath5 .",
    "thus the complete apparatus of alice and charlie forms a mach - zehnder interferometer , so that @xmath28 ( @xmath24 ) will always make the detector @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) click with certainty , allowing charlie to decode the transmitted bit correctly .",
    "any mismatched result between alice s transmitted state and charlie s measurement will immediately reveals the presence of eve @xcite .    comparing with the gv qkd scheme @xcite",
    ", the key difference is that @xmath31  and @xmath6 in the ki scheme are asymmetric beam splitters , while the gv scheme uses symmetric ones .",
    "the advantage of this modification is that the sending time of each photon can be fixed and publicly known beforehand , while in the gv scheme it has to be random and kept secret from eve until the security check .",
    "an important fact that will be useful for our qbc protocol is that , since the ki scheme is unconditionally secure , it is clear that eve s intercept - resend attack will always be detected with a nontrivial probability .",
    "that is , if she intercepts a state sent from alice and decodes a nontrivial amount of information , then the state she resends to charlie can not always make charlie s correct detector click at the right time with the probability @xmath32 , no matter what is eve s strategy on preparing the resent state .",
    "there will always be a nontrivial probability that the resent state will be detected by the wrong detector ( the one that should not click when no eavesdropping presented ) , or at the wrong time ( which is earlier or later than the correct arrival time when the state is not intercepted ) .",
    "please see @xcite for the rigorous proof , as well as some examples showing why eve s strategies do not work .",
    "as illustrated in fig . 2 , to build a qbc protocol upon the above ki qkd scheme , we treat charlie s site as a part of alice s , so that the two parties merge into one .",
    "alice sends out a bit - string @xmath33 encoded with the above orthogonal states , whose value is related to the bit @xmath0 she wants to commit .",
    "then she receives the states herself . meanwhile , let bob take the role of eve .",
    "his action shifts between two modes . in the _ bypass _ mode",
    ", he simply does nothing so that the corresponding parts of the states return to alice intact . in the _ intercept _ mode , he applies the intercept - resend attack .",
    "that is , he intercepts the state and decodes the corresponding bit ( which can be done using the same device as that of charlie s ) , and prepares a fake state to resend to alice on time .",
    "while there could be many strategies for bob to prepare the resent state , we use @xmath34 to denote the lower bound of the average probability for his resent state to be caught in alice s check . as we mentioned above",
    ", the unconditional security of the ki qkd scheme guarantees that @xmath35 can not always equal exactly to zero for both @xmath28  and @xmath24 even when bob uses the optimal strategy .",
    "therefore , alice is able to estimate the upper bound of the frequency of the presence of the intercept mode , to limit bob from intercepting the whole string @xmath33 , so that the value of the committed bit @xmath0 can be made concealing .",
    "meanwhile , since @xmath36 , at the end of the commit phase there will be some bits of the string become known to bob , while alice does not know the exact position of all these bits .",
    "thus she can not alter string @xmath33 freely at a later time , making the protocol binding .",
    "the complete qbc protocol is described below .",
    "the _ commit _ protocol :    \\(1 ) bob chooses a binary linear @xmath37-code @xmath38 @xcite and announces it to alice , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are agreed on by both alice and bob .",
    "\\(2 ) alice chooses a nonzero random @xmath39-bit string @xmath42 and announces it to bob .",
    "this makes any @xmath39-bit codeword @xmath43 in @xmath38 sorted into either of the two subsets @xmath44 and @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 .",
    "\\(3 ) now alice decides the value of the bit @xmath0 that she wants to commit .",
    "then she chooses a codeword @xmath33 from @xmath47 randomly .",
    "\\(4 ) alice encodes each bit of this specific @xmath33 as @xmath48 where the state @xmath49 is defined by equation ( [ eqpsi ] ) .",
    "she sends bob the two wave packets of the same state separately in channels @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with the storage ring @xmath22 on channel @xmath17 introducing a delay time @xmath50 known to bob .",
    "\\(5 ) for each of alice states @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , bob chooses the intercept mode with probability @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and the bypass mode with probability @xmath55 .",
    "if bob chooses to apply the bypass mode , he simply keeps channels @xmath16 and @xmath17 intact so that the state sent from alice will be returned to her detectors as is .",
    "else if bob chooses to apply the intercept mode , he uses the same measurement device as that of alice s , to measure @xmath49 so that he can decode @xmath56  with certainty .",
    "meanwhile , he prepares another state and sends it back to channels @xmath16 and @xmath57 at the right time , i.e. , the time which can ensure that it reaches alice s detectors at a time that looks as if bob were applying the bypass mode .",
    "there are many different strategies how bob sends this state ( thus we left this part of bob s device as a black box in fig .",
    "one of the simplest ways is to use the same device that alice uses for sending her state .",
    "more strategies will be discussed in section v.a .",
    "it will be shown there that all these strategies can not hurt the security of the protocol , so that bob are allowed to use any of them here . as stated above , in any strategy",
    "there is a nonvanishing probability that bob s resent state does not equal to alice s original @xmath51 since he has to send it before completing the measurement on @xmath51  ( to be further explained in section v.a too ) .",
    "let @xmath35 be the lower bound of this probability for all these strategies .",
    "\\(6 ) alice uses the same device that charlie used in the ki qkd scheme , to measure the output of the quantum channels from bob .",
    "she counts how many times her measurement results do not match the states she sent , and denotes it as @xmath58 . from step ( 5 )",
    "it can be shown that @xmath59 . thus alice can estimate the upper bound of the probability of bob choosing the intercept mode as @xmath60 .",
    "alice agrees to continue with the protocol if she finds @xmath54 , which means that the number of @xmath56 s known to bob is @xmath61 .",
    "otherwise she concludes that bob is cheating .",
    "the _ unveil _ protocol :    \\(7 ) alice announces the values of @xmath0 and the specific @xmath43 she chose .",
    "\\(8 ) bob accepts the commitment if @xmath62 and @xmath33 is indeed a codeword from @xmath38 , and every @xmath56  agrees with the state @xmath49 he detected in the intercept mode .",
    "for easy understanding , here we will first give a heuristic explanation of the security of the protocol . a more general theoretical proof will be provided in section v.b .",
    "the binary linear @xmath37-code @xmath38 used in the protocol can simply be viewed as a set of classical @xmath39-bit strings .",
    "each string is called a codeword .",
    "this set of strings has two features .",
    "\\(a ) among all the @xmath63 possible choices of @xmath39-bit strings , only a particular set of the size @xmath64  ( @xmath65 ) is selected to form this set .",
    "\\(b ) the distance ( i.e. , the number of different bits ) between any two codewords in this set is not less than @xmath41  ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "feature ( a ) puts a limit on alice s freedom on choosing the initial state @xmath67 , since each @xmath49 ( @xmath68 ) can not be chosen independently . instead",
    ", the string @xmath69 formed by the indices @xmath56 s can only be chosen among the codewords .",
    "meanwhile , feature ( b ) guarantees that if alice wants to change the string @xmath33 from one codeword into another so that the value of her committed @xmath0 can be altered , she needs to change at least @xmath41 bits of the codeword @xmath33 .",
    "but among the @xmath39 states she sent to bob , there are only @xmath70 states which she knows for sure that bob has applied the intercept mode . for each of the rest @xmath71 states",
    ", her measurement result always matches the state she sent , so that she can not distinguish unambiguously whether bob has applied the bypass mode or the intercept mode .",
    "if it was the intercept mode , bob already knew the corresponding bit @xmath56 of the codeword @xmath33 , so that alice s altering it will be caught inevitably .",
    "rigorously speaking , among these @xmath72 states , the probability that bob has applied the intercept mode is@xmath73therefore alice s altering one bit of the codeword will stand the probability @xmath74 to be detected , and her probability of altering @xmath75 bits without being detected will be @xmath76 . alternatively , alice may prepare @xmath77 initially in a state where @xmath33 is not a codeword .",
    "instead , it is half - way between two codewords , so that changing @xmath78 will be sufficient to turn it into one of the codewords . in this case",
    ", her probability of escaping the detection will be increased to @xmath79 .",
    "nevertheless , in either way the probability drops exponentially as @xmath41 increases .",
    "thus it can be made arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "on the other hand , feature ( a ) also guarantees that the number of different codewords having less than @xmath80 bits in common increases exponentially with @xmath40 .",
    "this is the key that makes our protocol secure against bob , as alice can bound the frequency @xmath53 that bob applies the intercept mode , which in turns bounds the number of the bits known to bob so that he can not know alice s actual choice of the codeword .",
    "the reason is that in step ( 5 ) of the protocol , no matter what is the strategy that bob used in his intercept mode to prepare the resent state , it can be shown that his resent state can not _",
    "always _ equal to the @xmath51 he received from alice , as long as he wants to ensure that the time it reaches alice s detectors will show no difference than the case where he were applying the bypass mode .",
    "that is , either bob s resent state in the intercept mode will inevitably make alice s detectors click earlier or later than the time it does when the bypass mode were used instead , or the resent state will be different from @xmath51 with a nonvanishing probability @xmath35 .    to see why this is the case ,",
    "let us first consider the strategy where bob prepares the resent state using the same device that alice uses for sending her @xmath51 .",
    "suppose that the first wave packet of alice s @xmath51 enters bob s site via channel @xmath16 ( before entering his storage ring ) at time @xmath81 ( which should be agreed on by both alice and bob beforehand ) .",
    "then the second wave packet of @xmath51 will enter bob s site via channel @xmath17 at time @xmath82 due to the existence of the storage ring in alice s sending device ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . as there is also another storage ring in alice s measurment device",
    ", bob must send the first wave packet of his resent state into channel @xmath16 at time @xmath81 , and send the second wave packet into channel @xmath17 at time @xmath82 , so that they can reach alice s measurement device at a time that looks like bob is running the bypass mode . here for simplicity , we assume that the time for the wave packets to travel the rest part of the channels ( other than the storage rings ) is negligible . that is , the first wave packet of bob s state needs to be sent before the second wave packet of alice s @xmath49 reaches him .",
    "otherwise his resent state will reach alice s detectors later than the expected arrival time when no interception occurs .",
    "therefore , by the time bob prepares the resent state , he has not received alice state completely yet so he does not know the form of @xmath83 .",
    "thus his resent state can not match alice s state with probability @xmath32 , and he can not make them match by his local operations acting solely on the second wave packet of his resent state ( the one to be sent via channel @xmath17 ) after the first wave packet in channel @xmath84 was already sent .",
    "on the other hand , suppose that bob waits until @xmath82 so that alice s @xmath51 enters his measurement device completely , and prepares the resent state following the measurement result .",
    "then even though the form of the states will match perfectly , the resent state will reach alice s detectors much later than it should when bob uses the bypass mode , because the storage ring in channel @xmath16 of alice s measurement device will delay the corresponding wave packet .",
    "this will make alice aware that bob is using the intercept mode too .",
    "alternatively , there can be another strategy where bob simply sends all wave packets of his state simultaneously via one of the channels alone , e.g. , through channel @xmath16 at time @xmath81 or through channel @xmath17 at time @xmath85 .",
    "but he will not be able to guarantee which of alice s detectors will click with certainty .",
    "though here we have only analyzed the above few strategies as examples , the result is common .",
    "that is , in any strategy potentially existed , there will be a nonvanishing probability ( let @xmath35 denote the lower bound of the probability for all strategies ) that alice will find a mismatched result between the @xmath51 she sent and her measurement on the state she received from bob , or the arrival time of bob s state is different from what it should be in the bypass mode .",
    "this is because , as mentioned in section iv , the role of bob in our protocol is actually the same as that of eve in the ki qkd scheme @xcite .",
    "if there is a strategy which is not bounded by the above result , then it can be utilized to fulfill a successful eavesdropping to the ki qkd scheme , which will conflict with the existing proof of the unconditional security of the scheme @xcite .    as a consequence ,",
    "whenever bob applies the intercept mode , alice can distinguish it from the bypass mode with the probability @xmath35 . then as described in step ( 6 ) , by counting the number @xmath58 of the mismatched results , alice can estimate the upper bound of the probability of bob choosing the intercept mode as @xmath60 .",
    "as she agrees to continue only when @xmath54 , it is guaranteed that during the commit phase , bob knows only @xmath61 bits of @xmath33 . since feature ( a ) of the binary linear @xmath37-code @xmath38 ensures that the number of different codewords having @xmath86 bits in common increases exponentially with @xmath40 , the potential choices for @xmath33 are too much for bob to determine whether @xmath33 belongs to the subset @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "thus the amount of information bob gained on the committed bit @xmath0 before the unveil phase can be made arbitrarily close to zero by increasing @xmath40 .",
    "taking both alice s and bob s cases studied above into consideration , we can see that fixing @xmath89 and @xmath90 while increasing @xmath39 will then result in a protocol secure against both sides .",
    "while it is hard to find a completely general proof like those for qkd qi70 showing that the protocol is secure against all cheating strategies that may potentially exist , here it can be shown that our protocol is at least secure against the specific cheating strategy proposed in the mlc theorem .      as pinpointed out in section 4 of @xcite , while there are many variations and extensions of the mlc no - go theorem @xcite-@xcite , their proofs all have the following common features .",
    "\\(i ) the reduced model .",
    "according to the no - go proofs , any qbc protocol can be reduced to the following model .",
    "alice and bob share a quantum state in a given hilbert space .",
    "each of them performs unitary transformations on the state in turns .",
    "all measurements are performed at the very end .",
    "( ii )  the coding method .",
    "the quantum state corresponding to the committed bit @xmath0 has the form@xmath91here the systems @xmath92 and @xmath93 are owned by alice and bob respectively .",
    "\\(iii ) the concealing condition . to ensure that bob s information on the committed bit is trivial before the unveil phase",
    ", any qbc protocol secure against bob should satisfy@xmath94where @xmath95 is the reduced density matrix corresponding to alice s committed bit @xmath0 , obtained by tracing over system @xmath96 in equation ( [ coding ] ) .",
    "note that in some presentation of the no - go proofs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this feature was expressed using the trace distance or the fidelity instead of the reduced density matrices , while the meaning remains the same .",
    "\\(iv ) the cheating strategy .",
    "as long as equation ( [ eqconcealing ] ) is satisfied , according to the hughston - jozsa - wootters ( hjw ) theorem ( a.k.a",
    ". the uhlmann theorem , etc . )",
    "@xcite , there exists a local unitary transformation for alice to map @xmath97 into @xmath98 successfully with a high probability @xcite .",
    "thus a dishonest alice can unveil the state as either @xmath99 or @xmath100  at her will with a high probability to escape bob s detection .",
    "consequently , a concealing qbc protocol can not be binding .      following the method of the mlc theorem to reduce our protocol into an equivalent form where alice and bob perform unitary transformations in turns on the quantum state they share",
    ", we can see that our commit protocol is essentially the following 3-stage process .",
    "\\(i ) alice prepares and sends bob a system @xmath101 containing @xmath39 qubits @xmath83 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) bob prepares an @xmath39-qubit system @xmath102 and an @xmath39-qutrit system @xmath103 .",
    "then he performs an operation @xmath104 on the combined system @xmath105 .",
    "\\(iii ) bob sends system @xmath102 to alice .    in this process",
    ", the initial state of each qubit in @xmath102 is chosen at bob s choice , and kept secret from alice .",
    "the system @xmath106 is for storing the result of bob s measurement on @xmath101 .",
    "the three orthogonal states of each qutrit in @xmath106 are denoted as @xmath107 , @xmath108  and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 ( @xmath108 ) means that the measurement result of @xmath51 is @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , and @xmath109  means that @xmath49 is not measured so that the result remains unknown .",
    "all the @xmath39 qutrits in system @xmath106 are initialized in @xmath113 .",
    "the operation @xmath114 is defined by the mode that bob chooses for each qubit in @xmath101 , where each @xmath115 ( @xmath68 ) is a @xmath116-particle operator acting on the @xmath117-th qubits / qutrit of @xmath102 , @xmath101 and @xmath106 .",
    "if bob chooses the bypass mode for the @xmath117-th qubit of @xmath101 , then@xmath118here @xmath119 is a @xmath120-qubit permutation operator which interchanges the states of the @xmath117-th qubits of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and @xmath121 is the identity operator that keeps the @xmath117-th qutrit of @xmath103  unchanged . or if bob chooses the intercept mode for the @xmath117-th qubit of @xmath101 , then@xmath122here @xmath123 is the identity operator on the @xmath117-th qubit of @xmath102 , @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) is an unitary transformation on the @xmath117-th qutrit of @xmath106 which can map the state @xmath113  into @xmath126  ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "that is , applying @xmath128  is equivalent to measuring the @xmath117-th qubit of @xmath101 and storing the result in the @xmath117-th qutrit of @xmath106 , while keeping the @xmath117-th qubit of @xmath102 unchanged . among all the possible forms of the operation @xmath104 , bob chooses one of those that can pass the security check in step ( 6 ) of our original protocol in section iv ( i.e. , the number of @xmath128 in @xmath104  should be @xmath61 ) , and keeps his choice secret from alice .",
    "now we will show why the specific cheating strategy in the mlc theorem does not apply to our protocol . with the above equivalent description , we can see that after the commit phase , the density matrix of the systems shared between alice and bob is in the form @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the density matrices for the systems @xmath102 , @xmath101 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "note that here the first @xmath39 qubits are now owned by alice , i.e. , they serve like the system @xmath92 in equation ( [ coding ] ) even though system @xmath102  was prepared by bob .",

    "meanwhile , the right side of equation ( [ ua ] ) is independent of @xmath104 too .",
    "therefore , equation ( ua ) can not be satisfied in general , unless @xmath136 always commutes with the specific @xmath104 s that bob may choose in the protocol . in this case",
    "@xmath143 , and equation ( [ ua ] ) becomes@xmath144 in many previous qbc protocols ( e.g. @xcite ) there is @xmath145 .",
    "then the hjw theorem guarantees that such a local @xmath136 exists , so that alice can alter the value of her committed bit . this is why the cheating strategy in the mlc theorem is always successful in such protocols .",
    "however , as shown from equation ( eqpsi ) , in our protocol @xmath14 and @xmath15 are orthogonal .",
    "thus the state @xmath67 corresponding to a specific codeword @xmath33 is orthogonal to the state corresponding to any other codeword .",
    "consequently , our qbc protocol satisfies @xmath146 , which is a crucial difference from previous insecure protocols . in this case",
    "the hjw theorem does not apply , making alice unable to find an local transformation @xmath136 acting on her system ( i.e. , system @xmath147 ) alone while satisfying equation ( [ ua2 ] ) . for this reason ,",
    "our protocol is immune to the specific cheating strategy proposed in the mlc no - go theorem .      as the system @xmath101  alice sent to bob in our qbc protocol satisfies @xmath148 , at the first glance it seems that bob can simply perform a measurement @xmath149  to project the state of @xmath150 into the hilbert spaces supported by @xmath151 ( @xmath152 )  and thus learn the value of alice s committed @xmath0 .",
    "but this is not true , because as shown above , the density matrix of the systems shared between alice and bob after the commit phase is @xmath129 .",
    "that is , bob is required to perform the operation @xmath104 on system @xmath101 .",
    "this @xmath104 is incommutable with the measurement @xmath149  on @xmath101  for distinguishing @xmath153 and @xmath134 , since equation ( [ u bypass ] ) indicates that @xmath104 contains permutation operators which act on not only system @xmath101 , but also other systems .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 and @xmath149  can not be both applied on @xmath101 .",
    "bob can only choose one of them .",
    "the timing of the sending of the states in the protocol also prevents bob from keeping system @xmath102 unsent until he receives the entire system @xmath101 .",
    "thus he needs to decide on the fly which operation to apply .",
    "once he applied @xmath104 , then the state of @xmath101 will be disturbed so that bob will lose the chance to apply @xmath149 on it for decoding @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the difference between @xmath104 and @xmath149  is detectable to alice . according to step ( 5 ) of our protocol",
    ", an @xmath104 is considered legitimate if it includes the operator @xmath154 ( i.e. , bob is using the bypass mode ) for @xmath155  times . on the contrary , because the minimal distance between the codewords is @xmath41 , the number of @xmath154 in @xmath149 must be less than @xmath41 . otherwise as a basic property of the binary linear @xmath37-code",
    ", the number of the possible codewords having less than @xmath80 bits in common will be at the order of magnitude of @xmath156 so that such an @xmath149 can provide only trivial information on the value of alice s committed @xmath0 .",
    "but as elaborated in section v.a , the unconditional security of the ki qkd scheme @xcite ensures that , for each of alice s state @xmath49 which bob applies the intercept mode , his resent state can equal to @xmath51 with the probability @xmath157 only , where there is always @xmath158 no matter which resend strategy bob uses .",
    "when the number of the applied bypass mode is less than @xmath41 , alice will find that the number of mismatched result between her received state and the original @xmath49 she sent will be @xmath159 .",
    "if she takes @xmath160 as stated in step ( 6 ) of the protocol , then she will find that @xmath161 .",
    "thus she knows that bob was attempting to apply the operation @xmath149 instead of a legitimate @xmath104 .",
    "namely , while alice s committed state satisfies @xmath162 so that it is distinguishable to bob , alice s security check in the protocol requires bob to perform an operation @xmath104 , which is incommutable with the operation @xmath149 for distinguishing @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the protocol thus becomes concealing against bob .",
    "in the above we focused only on the theoretical possibility of evading the mlc no - go theorem .",
    "but we can see from fig .",
    "2 that our protocol is also very feasible , as the required experimental technology is already available today @xcite .    also ,",
    "as the secret random sending time is no longer required , the commit phase will take less time than that of our previous protocol @xcite , and the total number of photons that bob needs to send in the intercept mode will be significantly reduced . more rigorously ,",
    "suppose that the minimal time for bob to shift between the intercept and bypass modes is @xmath163 .",
    "when both protocols choose the same @xmath39 as the length of the codewords , our previous protocol @xcite requires bob to send @xmath164  ( @xmath165 .",
    "note that @xmath53 was denoted as @xmath101 in @xcite ) photons in total , and the duration time of the commit phase is @xmath166 .",
    "but in the current protocol , the photon number is reduced to @xmath167 , and the duration time is @xmath168 . as it was suggested in section 3 of @xcite that a typical choice of the parameters is @xmath169 , we can see that the current protocol can be @xmath170 times more efficient than our previous one @xcite .",
    "there is another advantage of removing the need to keep the sending time secret at first .",
    "that is , now alice and bob can determine the binary linear @xmath171-code @xmath38 and decide on the sending time of the states @xmath172 ( @xmath68 ) beforehand , so that no more classical communication is needed at all during the commit phase , unless one of them finds the other participant cheating and announces to abort .",
    "therefore , it not only reduces the communication cost significantly , but also makes it easier for security analysis and comparison with the mlc theorem , which was generally deduced in a theoretical model where classical communication is not presented directly .    nevertheless , under practical settings , some more security checks should be added against technical attacks .",
    "especially , the physical systems implementing the states may actually have other degrees of freedom , which leave rooms for alice s cheating .",
    "for example , she may send photons with certain polarization or frequency , so that she can distinguish them from the photons bob sends in the intercept mode .",
    "in this case , bob and alice should discuss at the beginning of the protocol , to limit these degrees of freedom to a single mode . in step ( 5 )",
    "when bob chooses the intercept mode , he should also measure occasionally these degrees of freedom of some of alice s photons , instead of performing the measurement in the original step ( 5 ) . then if alice wants to send distinguishable photons with a high probability so that they are sufficient for her cheating , she will inevitably be detected .",
    "moreover , when bob applies the bypass mode , he should add phase shifters to both channels @xmath16 and @xmath17 to introduce the same phase shift in both channels so that an honest alice will not be affected ( to be explained in the appendix ) , while the amount of this phase shift is randomly chosen and kept secret from alice , so that the counterfactual attack described in the appendix can be defeated .",
    "note that all these technical attacks and the corresponding modifications are due to the imperfection of the physical systems implementing the protocol .",
    "they should not be messed with the theoretical possibility of evading the mlc no - go theorem .",
    "in conclusion , inspired by the ki simplified version @xcite of the gv qkd scheme @xcite , we improved our previously proposed qbc protocol @xcite , and proved that it is immune to the specific cheating strategy used in the mlc no - go theorem of unconditionally secure qbc .",
    "the key reason is that the density matrices of alice s states corresponding to the committed values @xmath9 and @xmath2 are orthogonal to each other , making her unable to find the local unitary transformation for the cheating by using the hjw theorem . meanwhile , the protocol remains concealing against bob because he is required to perform another operation , which is incommutable with the measurement for distinguishing the density matrices .",
    "however , there may potentially exist innumerous cheating strategies other than the one in the mlc theorem .",
    "it is natural to ask whether our protocol can be unconditionally secure against all these strategies .",
    "a rigorous evaluation of the upper bound of the cheating probability is also needed .",
    "for example , our protocol involves a probability @xmath35 which denotes the lower bound of the average probability for bob s resent state in step ( 5 ) to be caught in alice s check .",
    "the exact value of @xmath35 should be determined by the rigorous quantitatively security analysis of the ki qkd scheme .",
    "unfortunately , such a value was not yet provided in the literature @xcite . in turns ,",
    "the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41  in the binary linear @xmath37-code @xmath38 used in our protocol need to be chosen according to @xmath35 .",
    "therefore it remains unknown whether the cheater can have a nontrivial probability of success if these parameters are improperly chosen .",
    "we would like to leave these questions open for future researches .",
    "though the current qbc protocol and the one in @xcite have similarities in many ways , the underlying origins of their security against bob are somewhat different .",
    "while both protocols are immune to bob s cheating because they are based on unconditionally secure qkd schemes , as pointed out in @xcite , the gv qkd scheme can actually be viewed as utilizing three orthogonal states  two photon states and one vacuum state .",
    "its security is provided by the random sending time of the photons . on the contrary",
    ", the ki qkd scheme does not require the vacuum state and the secret sending time .",
    "the security is guaranteed by the fact that the eavesdropper can not fake the states with certainty owe to the use of the asymmetric beam splitters .",
    "similarly , the security of the qbc protocol in @xcite against bob is based on alice s random sending time that remains secret before the last step of the commit phase , while in our current qbc proposal , it is because bob can not fake the states with certainty when he runs the intercept mode .",
    "therefore our current protocol is more than merely a simplification on the presentation .",
    "the work was supported in part by the nsf of china , the nsf of guangdong province , and the foundation of zhongshan university advanced research center .",
    "as we mentioned in sec . 6 , under practical settings our qbc protocol may need some modifications against technical attacks .",
    "here we give such an example .",
    "recently a cheating strategy against counterfactual qkd protocols qi801,qi1026 was proposed @xcite . unlike general intercept - resend attacks in which measurements are performed on the quantum states carrying the secret information , in this strategy the cheater makes use of quantum counterfactual effect to detect the working modes of the devices of other participants .",
    "thus it was named the counterfactual attack  @xcite . here",
    "we will skip how it applies to qkd protocols , while focus only on its impact on our qbc protocol .",
    "( f2 ) when the paths @xmath173 and @xmath0 are adjusted correctly , two wave packets coming from paths @xmath173 and @xmath0 , respectively , will interfere and combine together , and enter path @xmath33 with certainty .",
    "an ideal fbs that can realize these functions faithfully does not exist in principle .",
    "thus it is called fictitious .",
    "for example , devices with the functions ( f2 ) and ( f3 ) may not accomplish the function ( f1 ) perfectly , i.e. , a photon coming from path @xmath33 could pass the devices with a nontrivial probability , making the attack detectable . however , fbs can be implemented approximately by using an infinite number of ordinary bs @xcite . in practice , the number of bs involved in the implementation has to be finite .",
    "but if the deviation from an ideal fbs is too small to be detected within the capability of available technology , then the attack could become a real threat .",
    "suppose that an ideal fbs is available to a dishonest alice in our qbc protocol .",
    "when she is supposed to send bob a state  in step ( 4 ) , she runs both the fbs system in fig .",
    "3 and the apparatus in the honest protocol ( i.e. , the one shown in fig .",
    "2 ) simultaneously in parallel , with path @xmath0 of the fbs system connecting to both the input and output of bob s channel @xmath16 ( or both the input and output of bob s channel @xmath17 ) . the apparatus in fig .",
    "2 works as usual so that the protocol can be executed as if she is honest , while the fbs system serves as a probe to detect bob s mode .",
    "according to the function ( f2 ) of the fbs , whenever bob applies the bypass mode in step ( 5 ) , the wave packets of a photon alice sent to the fbs will be returned from both paths @xmath173 and @xmath0 so that the detector @xmath174 will click with certainty . on the other hand , whenever bob applies the intercept mode , an ideal fbs can guarantee that @xmath174 will never click as path @xmath0 is actually blocked . therefore alice can learn bob s mode unambiguously . since bob",
    "does not know the state @xmath51  alice sends when he applies the bypass mode , alice can lie about the value of the corresponding @xmath56 freely , thus alters her committed @xmath0 in the unveil phase .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to defeat this counterfactual attack . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , bob s randomizing the optical length of path @xmath0 is sufficient to destroy the interference effect in the fbs system .",
    "therefore in our protocol , bob can simply add extra phase shifters ( other than the one shown in fig .",
    "2 ) to both channels @xmath16 and @xmath17 when he applies the bypass mode , to introduce the same phase shift @xmath175 in both channels , where the value of @xmath176  is randomly chosen and kept secret from alice , and can vary for different @xmath49 . in this case , after passing bob s apparatus , alice s initial states @xmath14  and @xmath21  will become , respectively ,      we can see that @xmath178  ( @xmath179 ) differs from @xmath28  ( @xmath24 ) merely by a global factor @xmath180 .",
    "it is well known that such a global factor is not detectable .",
    "in fact , in our case the interference pattern of the two wave packets meeting at the beam splitter of alice s measurement device is determined by their relative phase difference . no change will be detected when they both receive a phase shift @xmath175 .",
    "thus an honest alice who uses the original apparatus described in fig . 2 will still detect @xmath181  ( @xmath182 ) as @xmath14  ( @xmath15 ) , even though she does not know the value of @xmath176 .",
    "on the other hand , if alice wants to apply the above counterfactual attack , without knowing @xmath176 she can not know how to adjust path @xmath173 to ensure @xmath174 in fig .",
    "3 clicking with certainty . consequently",
    ", there will be times that alice does not know which mode bob is running . then the number of @xmath56 s that she can alter will be limited , which is insufficient to change the committed @xmath0  as long as the value of @xmath183 in our qbc protocol is properly chosen .",
