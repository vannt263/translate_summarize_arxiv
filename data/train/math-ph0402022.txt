    "the number @xmath1 of ( s - wave ) bound states possessed , in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in ordinary ( three - dimensional ) space , by a central potential @xmath3 , coincides with the number of zeros , in the interval @xmath6 , of the solution of the zero - energy ( s - wave ) radial schrdinger equation    [ eq1 ] @xmath7 characterized by the boundary condition @xmath8    here and throughout appended primes denote differentiations and we use units such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass of the particle bound by the potential @xmath3 , which is hereafter assumed to have the standard properties generally required in this context : to vanish at infinity , and to be such that the integral written in the following formula ( [ eq2 ] ) is finite .",
    "semiclassical \" estimate @xmath11 for @xmath1 reads ( see , for instance , @xcite ; but note that @xmath11 is generally not an integer ) @xmath12 here and throughout we use the notation @xmath13 to denote the negative (  attractive \" ) part of the corresponding potential @xmath3 , @xmath14.\\ ] ] here and below @xmath15 denotes the standard step function , @xmath16 if @xmath17 , @xmath18 if @xmath19 .",
    "these results , as well as those discussed in the rest of this paper , can be extended to higher partial waves characterized by the angular momentum quantum number @xmath4 , via the standard replacement of the potential @xmath3 with the  effective \" @xmath4-wave potential @xmath20 in 1968 chadan @xcite has shown that  consistently with the  correspondence principle \" relating quantum mechanics at large quantum numbers with classical mechanics  the number @xmath1 of s - wave bound states ( as well as the number of bound states for any fixed angular momentum @xmath4 ) possessed by the potential @xmath21 grows asymptotically , when the strength @xmath22 of the potential diverges , just as the semiclassical estimate ( [ eq2 ] ) : @xmath23 here the symbol @xmath24 denotes asymptotic equality ( up to lower order additive corrections ) .",
    "this finding entails of course that , for strong potentials possessing many bound states , the semiclassical estimate ( [ eq2 ] ) provides a good approximation to the number of ( s - wave ) bound states @xmath1 .",
    "more recently ( rigorous ) upper and lower limits on the number @xmath1 of ( s - wave ) bound states have been obtained @xcite , which are mainly given by the semiclassical estimate @xmath11 ( [ eq2 ] ) , and that therefore generally approximate well the ( large ) number of bound states possessed by strongly binding potentials ; but these limits also feature certain additional terms , that generally only play a minor quantitative role ( when the number of bound states is not too small ) , yet mar the neatness of these results inasmuch as they introduce a not - too - transparent dependence on the potential @xmath3 .",
    "these limits have been proven in @xcite for monotonically increasing potentials , and have been generalized in @xcite to more general potentials , also in order to include the higher partial wave case ( note that the effective @xmath4-wave potential ( [ eq4 ] ) can not belong to the class of monotonically increasing potentials ) .",
    "they read , for monotonic potentials ,    [ eq7 ] @xmath25 @xmath26 where we use of course the definition ( [ eq2 ] ) of @xmath11 and the two radii @xmath27 and @xmath28 are defined by the two relations @xmath29 purpose and scope of this paper is to identify a class of potentials for which the semiclassical expression ( [ eq2 ] ) provides itself a ( rigorous ) lower limit for the number @xmath1 of s - wave bound states  with the possibility to extend these results to higher partial waves via the replacement of the potential @xmath3 with the effective @xmath4-wave potential ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "we also identify below ( see remark 2 ) another class of potentials for which the semiclassical estimate ( [ eq2 ] ) provides an upper bound to the number of s - wave bound states  but this class is so much more restricted ( including the fact that it does not allow the extension to higher partial waves ) that we decided to focus this paper on the lower limit ( see title ) .    to obtain our neat lower bound we restrict attention to potentials that possess at most two zeros in the interval @xmath30 and that are negative (  attractive \" ) between them :    [ eq8 ] @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 this restriction is generally adequate to accommodate most cases of interest  including the treatment of higher partial waves via the replacement of the potential @xmath3 with the effective @xmath4-wave potential ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "note that we are not excluding the possibility that @xmath34 not be positive ( namely , potentials attractive rather than repulsive at the origin ) or @xmath35 be infinity ( namely , potentials attractive rather than repulsive at infinity )  in which cases the potential would possess less than two zeros in the interval @xmath30 , and ( [ eq8 ] ) should be modified accordingly . as for the upper bound result",
    ", it only applies to everywhere attractive potentials without any zeros , and with additional restrictions , see remark 2 below .",
    "we now state our main result .",
    "consider , in the interval @xmath36 , the auxiliary function @xmath37 defined , in terms of the original potential @xmath3 , as follows :    @xmath38 ^{2}-\\frac{v''(r)}{4v(r)}.\\ ] ]    note that this auxiliary function does not depend on the strength @xmath22 of the potential , see ( [ eq5 ] ) , but only on its shape , and that it is finite inside the interval @xmath36 , although it generally diverges to positive infinity at its borders , see ( [ eq8a ] ) .",
    "our class of potentials is then characterized by the property that this function @xmath37 be positive not only at the borders of the interval @xmath36 , but as well that it be nonnegative throughout this interval : @xmath39 for this class of potentials there holds then the following ( rigorous ) lower limit on the number @xmath1 of s - wave bound states : @xmath40 here and throughout the double braces denote the integer part .",
    "this results is proven in section [ sec3 ] , so as to make this paper self - contained ( actually this finding is an extension of a result obtained in @xcite , see the remark 1 below ) . and",
    "the remarkable stringency of the lower limit ( [ eq11 ] ) is demonstrated in the following section [ sec2 ] , for various test potentials .",
    "we end this section with 6 remarks .    _",
    "remark 1_. in @xcite a treatment analogous to that reported in section [ sec3 ] below was given in the more general context of @xmath4-waves ( but the potential was supposed to be negative for all values of @xmath41 , we show here that this restriction is not necessary ) ; here we restrict our consideration to the s - wave case , because our main purpose in this paper is to exhibit the neat lower limit ( [ eq11 ] ) closely related to the semiclassical expression ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the possibility remains of course to apply this result to higher partial waves via the replacement of the potential @xmath3 with the effective @xmath42-wave potential ( [ eq4 ] ) .    _",
    "remark 2_. as implied by the treatment given in section [ sec3 ] , for the class of potentials characterized by the condition opposite to ( [ eq10 ] ) , @xmath43 there holds the upper limit @xmath44 but , due to the fact that the auxiliary function @xmath37 generally diverges to positive infinity where the potential @xmath3 vanishes , this class can only include potentials without any zero ( namely , everywhere attractive  thereby excluding the extension of the result to higher partial waves via the effective potential ( [ eq4 ] ) ) , and it requires moreover that the potential @xmath3 vanish asymptotically , as @xmath45 , no faster than @xmath46 ( to prevent the auxiliary function @xmath37 from becoming positive as @xmath45 , thereby violating ( [ eq12 ] ) which should of course now hold for all positive values of @xmath41 ) .    _",
    "remark 3_. for the square - well potential    [ eq14 ] @xmath47(for which the function @xmath37 vanishes trivially in the interval @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 hence in this case the lower limit ( [ eq11 ] ) is essentially saturated ( as well as the upper limit ( [ eq13 ] ) ) .",
    "the slight discrepancy is due to the fact that , for @xmath51 , ( [ eq14a ] ) does not quite satisfy ( 8c ) .    _",
    "remark 4_. the special case of a potential @xmath3 such that the auxiliary function ( [ eq9 ] ) vanishes ( nontrivially ) , @xmath52 , has been discussed separately ( in fact , in a more general context ) @xcite .    _",
    "remark 5_. let us emphasize the crucial role played by the  shape \" conditions ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) ( or ( [ eq12 ] ) ) .",
    "it is indeed easy to show that there exist potentials  obviously not restricted by these conditions  that possess no bound states at all , @xmath53 , while the corresponding value of @xmath11 is arbitrarily large , as well indeed as potentials that possess an arbitrarily large number of bound states @xmath1 while the corresponding value of @xmath11 is arbitrarily small ; for instance a potential of this second kind can be realized as an appropriate sequence of negative delta functions , while a potential of the first kind  contradicting dramatically the bound ( [ eq11 ] )  can be realized as an arbitrarily long negative square well with an appropriate sequence of positive delta functions embedded in it .    _",
    "remark 6_. finally , let us note that , due to the ease nowadays to compute numerically the number of bound states for any given potential ( especially using techniques such as those described in @xcite ) , the results reported in this paper have mainly an academic  rather than a practical  relevance ; except in the case of strongly binding potentials possessing very many bound states , where numerical computations might be somewhat cumbersome , while the rigorous bounds reported above might yield explicitly computable results that are moreover likely to be quite close to the exact results ( see some of the examples in the following section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "we test in this section the new lower limit ( [ eq11 ] ) with some specific potentials .",
    "the first potential we consider is the ( solvable ) morse potential @xcite    @xmath54 -\\exp\\left [ -2\\frac{r}{r}+2\\alpha \\right ] \\right\\ } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath55 , as well of course as @xmath56 , is an arbitrary positive constant .",
    "this potential has a single zero at @xmath57 if @xmath58 otherwise it is negative ( attractive ) in the entire interval @xmath59 .",
    "the number of its ( s - wave ) bound states @xmath1 turns out to be independent of @xmath60 : @xmath61 for this potential , @xmath37 is positive ( for all values of @xmath55 ) hence the lower limit ( [ eq11 ] ) applies and it reads @xmath62 thus the maximal gap between the exact result and the lower bound is , at most , of one unit for all values of @xmath63 .",
    "the second potential we consider is the ( solvable , and everywhere negative ) pschl - teller @xcite  or",
    " single soliton \" ( see for instance @xcite )  potential @xmath64^{-2}.\\ ] ] the number @xmath1 of ( s - wave ) bound states for this potential is @xmath65 for this potential , @xmath37 is also everywhere positive hence the lower limit ( [ eq11 ] ) applies and it reads @xmath66 thus the maximal gap between the exact result and the lower bound is again , at most , of one unit for all values of @xmath63 .    the third potential we consider is the lennard - jones potential @xmath67,\\ ] ] which clearly has a single zero at @xmath68 . in this case , the exact number @xmath1 of ( s - wave ) bound states is not computable analytically , hence numerical calculations are necessary . for this potential ,",
    "@xmath37 is also positive",
    ". the lower limit ( [ eq11 ] ) , which can be computed analytically , reads @xmath69 numerical investigations for @xmath70 ( @xmath71 yields 67 bound states ) show that the maximal gap between the exact result and the lower bound is again , at most , of one unit for all these values of @xmath63 .",
    "the last ( everywhere attractive class of ) potential(s ) we consider reads @xmath72\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath73 are two arbitrary positive constants , @xmath74 @xmath75 , that satisfy the following condition : @xmath76 this inequality is necessary and sufficient to guarantee validity of the inequality ( [ eq10 ] ) ( with @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , hence the applicability of the lower limit ( [ eq11 ] ) , which can be evaluated exactly and it yields the explicit lower limit @xmath79 in particular , when @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we obtain the lower limit @xmath82 on the number of s - wave bound states for the exponential potential @xmath83 , which simplifies and improves the lower limit given in our previous work ( see eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . numerical investigations for this exponential potential with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 yields 127 bound states ) show that the maximal gap between the exact result and the lower bound is again , at most , of one unit for all these values of @xmath63 .",
    "in this section we prove our main result , as reported in section [ sec1 ] . our main task is to count  or rather bound from below ",
    "the number @xmath1 of zeros ( in the interval @xmath6 ) of the wave function @xmath86 characterized by ( [ eq1 ] ) , with a potential @xmath3 that has , to begin with , the property ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath86 has no zeros for @xmath87 , since it vanishes at the origin , see ( [ eq1b ] ) , and it is convex in the interval @xmath88 ( see ( [ eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq8c ] ) ) ; and it can possess at most one zero in the region @xmath89 where it is also convex ( see ( [ eq1a ] ) and ( [ eq8c ] ) ) . therefore to bound from below the number @xmath1 of its zeros it is sufficient to consider the inner interval @xmath90 . to count the zeros of @xmath86 in this interval",
    "it is convenient to introduce the function @xmath91 by setting @xmath92 = \\frac{u'(r)}{u(r)}+\\frac{v'(r)}{4v(r)}.\\ ] ] it is then easily seen , via ( [ eq1 ] ) , that @xmath91 satisfies the first - order equation @xmath93\\ ] ] where we used the definition ( [ eq9 ] ) , and this implies @xmath94,\\ ] ] hence , via ( [ eq10 ] ) ,    [ eq18 ] @xmath95 hence , via ( [ eq8c ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath96 hence , via ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath97 in these last three formulas , ( [ eq18 ] ) , we used the strict inequality sign , neglecting for simplicity the very marginal cases when this would not be justified .",
    "we now observe that the differential equation ( [ eq16 ] ) implies that , every time @xmath91 goes through an integer multiple of @xmath98 , its derivative @xmath99 is positive , while the formula ( [ eq15 ] ) implies that , every time @xmath100 goes through an integer multiple of @xmath98 , the wave function @xmath86 vanishes .",
    "it is moreover clear from ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq8a ] ) that both @xmath101 and @xmath102 are integer multiples of @xmath98 ; a result which can be obtained as well from the differential equation ( [ eq16 ] ) ( integrate it forward from a value just before @xmath35 to @xmath103 or backward from a value just after @xmath34 to @xmath104 taking into account the divergence of @xmath37 at @xmath35 and at @xmath104 see ( [ eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq8a ] ) ) .",
    "one therefore concludes ( sketch a graph of @xmath100 using the above information ! ) that the number @xmath105 of zeros of @xmath86 in the interval @xmath36 is given by the expression      ( here we exclude from consideration the marginal case in which @xmath107 .",
    "we now note that , if @xmath108 , all the zeros of the wave function @xmath86 for @xmath6 are in this interval , hence in this case their number @xmath1 coincides with @xmath109 if instead @xmath110 , the last zero of the wave function can be inside respectively outside the interval @xmath111 , yielding @xmath112 respectively @xmath113 . in any case we conclude that @xmath114 , and this , together with ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq18c ] ) , entails ( [ eq11 ] )",
    ". q. e. d.    the modification of this proof to validate the upper limit ( [ eq13 ] ) is obvious : all one needs to note is that the replacement of ( [ eq10 ] ) with ( [ eq12 ] ) entails that the inequalities ( [ eq18 ] ) must be reversed , and then via the analysis just made above ( the case @xmath115 necessarily violate ( [ eq12 ] ) ) one gets ( [ eq13 ] ) ."
