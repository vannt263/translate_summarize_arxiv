    "the m - branes of m - theory are not understood nearly so well as their d - brane counterparts .",
    "undoubtedly this has something to do with the age of m - theory compared to that of string theory , but it is also true to say that m - theory , as a higher dimensional theory and a generalisation , has presented new challenges in areas that are now straightforward for string theorists .",
    "one of these problems involves the quantisation of n coincident d - branes , which in string theory has a low energy limit based on a non - abelian yang - mills lie algebra . in m - theory , the analogues are coincident m2-branes , which up until recently had no simple description for their quantisation .",
    "work by bagger and lambert @xcite@xcite@xcite , and later gustavsson @xcite shed light on this , using a 3-algebra in the same sort of way as the multiple - f1 system used the lie algebra , and hence constructing an action ( the bagger - lambert - gustavsson action ) for coincident m2-branes .",
    "however , the 3-algebra used by bagger , lambert and gustavsson is itself not well understood .",
    "when looking at two coincident m2s , the only compatible 3-algebra found at the time had the simple 3-bracket @xmath0=\\varepsilon^{ijkl}t^{l}$ ] ( although new examples are now coming to light @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty in finding new solutions ( as well as the requirement for an invariant metric ) is making the 3-bracket satisfy the fundamental identity , the generalisation of the jacobi identity for a 3-algebra .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to shed some more light on the 3-bracket s role in m - brane geometry .",
    "this task is aided in part by the work of chu and smith , whose paper @xcite uses basu - harvey fuzzy funnels in order to probe the @xmath1-field on the m5-brane with multiple m2-branes to deduce properties of the m5 theory , similarly to how multiple d1-branes can probe a @xmath2-field on the d3-brane . in the latter case , this ns @xmath2-field translates via a seiberg - witten map into the known non - commutative geometry on the d - brane represented by @xmath3=\\theta^{ij}$ ] ( for some @xmath2-field - related constants @xmath4 ) . for the 3-algebra , in contrast",
    ", the @xmath1-field leads to an equation @xmath5=\\theta^{ijk}$ ] , which represents some novel quantum geometry for the m5-brane .    to get more information about the 3-bracket ( both its form and its meaning within the theory ) , it would be useful to know how it relates to the commutator - i.e. to reduce the m5 action to , say , a d3 action and hence ( by comparison with known d3 actions ) relate the constants @xmath6 from the m - brane geometry to the constants @xmath4 .",
    "this would begin to give us some insight into how the quantum geometry of the m5-brane works .",
    "the results of two papers are useful here .",
    "the previously mentioned paper @xcite , of course , provides the link between the 3-bracket equation and the @xmath1-field .",
    "the second paper , by pasti , sorokin and tonin @xcite provides an action for an m5-brane with a @xmath1-field , and a reduction as far as a d4-brane for a simplified case .",
    "the full reduction using a @xmath1-field with all components switched on will be beyond the scope of this paper , but instead we will focus on the two - component case considered in @xcite where the coincident m2-branes end on an m5-brane at an angle @xmath7 .",
    "this will involve following the process of @xcite but without setting @xmath8 to zero .",
    "a key question is whether the results of this compactification will tally with known results about coincident strings ending on d3-branes at an angle , and in the final part of the paper a comparison with the non - commutative geometry known for d - branes will be attempted to assess this , using results from @xcite .",
    "we consider an m2-brane with coordinates 0 and 2 in common with the m5-brane that it connects with :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we begin with the known m5 action , from @xcite .",
    "@xmath9    where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 the worldvolume field strength ) , @xmath12 is the hodge star of h , and @xmath13 .",
    "the field @xmath14 is an auxiliary field introduced to ensure d=6 covariance of the action @xcite , since the self - dual field - strength @xmath15 on its own would prevent us from writing a kinetic term ( since @xmath16 ) . in order for @xmath17 to reduce to a standard d4 action , it is also necessary to dualise it .",
    "@xcite contains a reduction / dualisation of the m5 action , but they make one assumption that we do nt want to make here , namely that @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the direction of reduction ) .",
    "we retain the assumption of a gauge choice such that the auxiliary field @xmath14 satisfies @xmath20 , and the assumption of a metric whose determinant is unchanged after reduction , specifically in directions 2 and 5 .",
    "the removal of this assumption causes terms involving @xmath21 to become non - zero .",
    "this means that any direction of reduction will result in non - zero fields @xmath22 as well as the @xmath23 fields found in @xcite .",
    "this in turn makes dualisation of the fields rather more complicated - before , the @xmath24-fields could be dualised by replacement with their hodge star ( give or take a constant factor ) but this is only true for @xmath18 and compactification in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "to do the dualisation from scratch , we begin by expanding some of the @xmath25s , and splitting @xmath24 and @xmath1 into their 2- and 3-form parts :    @xmath26=\\int\\textrm{d}^{5}x\\,\\sqrt{\\det\\left(g_{\\alpha\\beta}+i(\\star h)_{\\alpha\\beta}\\right)}+\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta\\epsilon}c_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta\\epsilon}^{(5)}+\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\\\ \\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta\\epsilon}\\left(-\\tfrac{1}{24}\\left(f^{(2)}f^{(3)}+c^{(2)}c^{(3)}\\right)_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta\\epsilon}+\\tfrac{1}{12}\\left(f^{(2)}c^{(3)}+c^{(2)}f^{(3)}\\right)_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta\\epsilon}\\right)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the next step is to add two different lagrange multiplier terms to the action in order to impose the @xmath11 constraint in both the 2- and 3-form cases @xcite :    @xmath27=s\\left[f^{(2)},f^{(3)}\\right]+\\qquad\\\\ \\int\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta\\epsilon}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}i\\left(\\star\\hat{f}\\right)_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}^{(3)}\\left(f_{\\delta\\epsilon}^{(2)}-2\\partial_{\\delta}a_{\\epsilon}\\right)+\\tfrac{1}{6}i\\left(\\star\\hat{f}\\right)_{\\alpha\\beta}^{(2)}\\left(f_{\\gamma\\delta\\epsilon}^{(3)}-2\\partial_{\\gamma}a_{\\delta\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the two lagrange multipliers are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with their constants chosen for convenience .",
    "note that despite the factors of @xmath30 , these terms will turn out to be real .    from here ,",
    "taking equations of motion in each of @xmath23 and @xmath22 in turn , results in two independent equations that determine the new @xmath24s in terms of the old:@xmath31 where tildes indicate hodge stars . finally , in order to keep the born - infeld part of the new action in the same form as the old one , we define the new @xmath32-fields by saying that @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 analogous to @xmath10 ) .",
    "this results in:@xmath35    substituting into , the result is the dualised - reduced - m5 action :    @xmath36    where we have absorbed the @xmath37 term along with @xmath38 into the new @xmath39 .",
    "note that this is a d4 action , but we havent chosen which numbers the indices run over yet .",
    "we do so in the next section .      in order to simplify things a bit for the purposes of more reduction , we ll start with the above ( dualised - reduced-)m5 action with a specific @xmath1-field which has two non - zero parts : one including the direction of the m2-brane and one not . specifically , we ll look at the choice found in @xcite which represents an m2-brane at an angle of @xmath7 to the m5-brane , i.e. @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( with all other @xmath42 and also @xmath43 zero ) .",
    "we then have two choices of how to compactify down to a d4-brane in iia - by compactifying a direction perpendicular to the m2-brane ( say 5 ) , or a dimension parallel to the m2-brane ( say 2 ) .",
    "these produce a d2 on a d4 , and an f1 on a d4 respectively , with actions as shown here .",
    "@xmath44    @xmath45    note also that the original two @xmath1-field components come through this unchanged ; to get a result for a more general two - component @xmath1-field is simply a matter of replacing @xmath46 and @xmath47 above respectively with @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( d4-d2 case ) or @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( d4-f1 case ) .      to turn the d4 actions into their related d3 actions we must t - dualise , in directions 2 and 5 respectively @xcite .",
    "since all the wz terms have a component of these directions ( recall that @xmath47 and @xmath46 are @xmath1-fields in the directions perpendicular to the @xmath24s ) this simply has the effect of removing all 2 s and 5 s and reducing the dimensions by 1 .",
    "( note that the born - infeld part of each action remains the same . )",
    "@xmath52    @xmath53    again , the general two - component @xmath1-field result follows by directly substituting for sin and tan alpha , crossing out the 2s and 5s from the general @xmath1-fields given at the end of the last section . from this , and the standard d3 action found in @xcite , we can see that in each case one of the two parts of the @xmath1-field has become a rr @xmath54-field and one part has become a ns @xmath55-field . specifically , we get @xmath56 , @xmath57 for the d3-d1 case , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 for the d3-f1 case .      at this point",
    ", it is worth taking a moment to consider how all this relates back to the geometry of the d- and m - brane systems .",
    "we are looking particularly at set - ups where a lower dimensional brane ends on a higher dimensional brane at an angle , and have established that it s possible to reduce and dualise in such a way as to turn the m5-m2 system into either a d3-d1 system or a d3-f1 system . in terms of the d - brane geometry , we know that adding a constant ns @xmath2-field to the d - brane worldvolume causes the worldvolume coordinates @xmath60 to obey a commutation relation@xmath61\\label{eq : commutator}\\ ] ] with components of @xmath62 dependent on the @xmath2-field . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "this can be written as @xmath63\\label{eq : commutatorappr}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath24 is the worldvolume field strength on the brane @xcite .",
    "note that since the geometry depends only on total field @xmath65 , it is indifferent to which parts of the field come from the field strength @xmath24 and which from the @xmath2-field .    in the m - brane case",
    "we expect an analogous situation with the quantum geometry represented by the 3-bracket - that is , upon adding a @xmath66-field it takes the form@xmath67\\label{eq:3bracket}\\ ] ] and if @xmath1 is sufficiently small we can approximate this by @xmath68\\label{eq:3bracketappr}\\ ] ] with @xmath69 @xcite . in the reduction , as we ve seen , this @xmath66-field splits into two pieces , with one part becoming a rr @xmath54-field and one part becoming a ns @xmath55-field . now in equation , we have @xmath70 ( with @xmath71 the original worldvolume field strength ) .",
    "hence it is clear that in theory the same d - brane geometry could be produced by various sets of fields , so long as they come together to the same @xmath65 .    from a purely geometric standpoint",
    ", we can see that reducing and dualising an angled - m2-on - m5 system should produce an angled - d1/f1-on - d3 system , with the same angle @xmath7 involved throughout .",
    "thus , we might expect that the geometry as specified by should reduce to the geometry as specified by .",
    "the question is , can we explicitly check this for the particular case we re looking at ? from @xcite , we know that@xmath72=\\begin{cases } \\frac{i\\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\sin\\alpha}{k\\cos^{4}\\alpha } & \\mu,\\nu,\\lambda\\in\\{0,1,2\\}\\\\ -\\frac{i\\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\tan\\alpha}{k\\sec^{4}\\alpha } & \\mu,\\nu,\\lambda\\in\\{3,4,5\\}\\\\ 0 & \\textrm{otherwise}\\end{cases}\\label{eq:3-bracketdetail}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath73 is a dimensional proportionality constant ) is the relevant equation for the angled - m2-on - m5 ( with @xmath1-fields as specified in [ sub : secwithcfields ] ) , while@xmath74=\\begin{cases } \\frac{i\\varepsilon^{\\mu\\nu}(2\\pi\\alpha^{\\prime})\\tan\\alpha}{1+\\tan^{2}\\alpha } & \\mu,\\nu\\in\\{3,4\\}\\\\ 0 & \\textrm{otherwise}\\end{cases}\\label{eq : commdetail}\\ ] ] is the equation for an angled - d1-on - d3 , arrived at by including a @xmath2-field @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "thus we make the `` geometry reduction conjecture '' that the system with geometry specified by should reduce to one with geometry specified by .",
    "so far , we have found the explicit reduction of @xmath66 yields a @xmath2 and @xmath54 combination .",
    "for example , in the d3-d1 case , we get @xmath76 plus @xmath77 .",
    "this clearly is not the same as the standard example of an angled d3-d1 system found in the literature , which has only a @xmath2-field @xmath78 .",
    "however , as we showed in [ sub : geometry ] , it is entirely possible that two such systems could indeed have the same non - commutative geometry , and indeed there is good reason to suggest that they should . to check this , though , it is necessary to construct the total field strength from the various fields obtained in the reduction .    in @xcite ,",
    "cornalba et al . give a method for constructing a field strength @xmath65 from a background @xmath79 gauge field strength @xmath71 with infinitesimal @xmath80- and @xmath81-fields added to it using@xmath82 where    @xmath83 for the @xmath2-field , and    @xmath84 for the @xmath1-field , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 a specific 2-form that depends on the initial @xmath71 .",
    "it would be useful to know whether this method of deriving @xmath65 is still applicable outside the infinitesimal domain , i.e. for general @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "certainly there is an obvious way to proceed , by calculating @xmath87 in terms of @xmath80 or @xmath81 and then solving the resulting differential equation(s ) to find the new @xmath65 in terms of fields @xmath71 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in a footnote of @xcite",
    "this is done for a finite @xmath2-field with @xmath1 and @xmath71 set to zero , and the answer is @xmath88 .",
    "finite @xmath2-field , infinitesimal @xmath81-field ]    in order for the method to make sense for finite order though , it is necessary for it to be path independent .",
    "that is to say , it should nt matter in what order the finite @xmath2 and @xmath1 are added ( or even if they are added piece by piece ) - the resulting @xmath65 should be the same .",
    "a first step towards this is to look at putting together a finite @xmath2-field with an infinitesimal @xmath81-field , such as shown in figure [ fig : finiteinf ] .",
    "there are two paths on this diagram - one that takes the simple route from @xmath71 to @xmath89 by the addition of an infinitesimal @xmath81 , and one that takes the long way round to @xmath90 by adding a finite @xmath2 , then the @xmath81 , then @xmath91 .",
    "note that the process of putting a new field into @xmath65 is not really as simple as addition , so it is a nontrivial problem to ask whether @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the same , or to what order in @xmath81 equality holds .",
    "( if equality holds for sufficiently high order , it should be possible to `` sum up '' ( i.e. integrate ) a block of such paths to prove path - independence for finite @xmath2 and @xmath1 . )    checking this for general @xmath2 and @xmath81 turns out to be rather difficult . when all components of the two fields are switched on the result",
    "is a matrix of interlinked differential equations with no easy solutions .",
    "however , with the results of section [ sec : the - compactification ] in mind it would be instructive to look at the case where @xmath92 , @xmath93 . with only one component in each field",
    ", equation can be solved repeatedly to find the new field . first to find @xmath89:@xmath94 then @xmath95:@xmath96 then @xmath97:@xmath98 and finally @xmath90:@xmath99 after substituting and simplifying:@xmath100 this agrees to constant term , but no further , with the @xmath89 result in .",
    "it also agrees to first order and beyond in @xmath81 if @xmath2 and @xmath71 are infinitesimal , in line with the results of @xcite which says that @xmath89 and @xmath90 should be equal in this case .",
    "this unfortunately suggests that the @xmath65-construction method will not work for general @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "hence it can not reliably be used to check the geometry reduction conjecture made at the end of section [ sec : the - compactification ] .",
    "we have seen that it is possible to generalise the results of @xcite to the case where @xmath101 .",
    "the continued assumption of gauge choice such that @xmath20 seems reasonable , while it might be interesting ( if rather trickier ) in future work to look at breaking the final assumption : i.e. to look at some specific cases where the determinant of the metric contributes extra terms to the action when reduced in directions 2 and/or 5 .    in this paper ,",
    "the generalisation has led to some new d4 and d3 actions representing various possible compactifications of an m5 with background @xmath1-field . in particular , by comparison with well - known actions for the d3-brane , we have seen that under these conditions a @xmath66-field with two orthogonal components reduces to two 2-forms , @xmath2 and @xmath54 , with directly comparable components to those of the original field .",
    "these have suggested that the non - commutative geometry of the d3-brane could be arrived at using a combination of @xmath2- and @xmath1-fields , as well as purely from a @xmath2-field as we are accustomed to .",
    "if proved fully , this illumination could work both ways : the method could be useful in bagger - lambert theory , if the poorly - understood 3-bracket used to describe the quantum geometry of the m5-brane could be in some way directly compared to the simpler commutator used for d3-branes . alternatively , finding that this particular @xmath2 and @xmath1 combination _ does _ in fact result in a different d - brane non - commutative geometry ( i.e. that the conjecture is false ) would also be an interesting result , though perhaps it is less likely given what we know from the geometrical picture .    in the last section of the paper",
    ", we saw that the method for constructing a single field @xmath65 out of background fields ( found in @xcite ) was path - dependent , and hence badly - defined , for non - infinitesimal combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath1 fields .",
    "any future work modifying this method for finite fields should be able to use the results of this paper to check the geometry reduction conjecture , i.e. to see for sure whether the reduction of an m - brane quantum geometry is ( at least in this specific case ) equivalent to the known d - brane non - commutative geometry .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the next step would be to try and get some idea of what happens to the 3-bracket during the reduction process , as this might lead to a method to convert any known @xmath102 ( i.e. any specific instance of ) , into the @xmath103 that specifies the non - commutative geometry of the reduced system ."
