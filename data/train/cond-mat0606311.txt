    "in 2d electron systems with high ( @xmath0  @xmath1/vs ) electron mobility , the magnetoresistance exhibits strong oscillations in `` pre - shubnikov '' range of magnetic fields under microwave irradiation @xcite .",
    "these oscillations are caused by electron transitions between landau levels due to the electric component of the microwave radiation .",
    "together with the oscillations of the diagonal components of the conductivity tensor , `` beats '' have been found experimentally @xcite in the interval of more weak magnetic fields .",
    "such beats are usually related with the manifestations of the interaction between kinetic and spin degrees of freedom of the conductivity electrons .",
    "such interaction is the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) that is known to be the origin of numerous effects in transport phenomena observed in such systems @xcite , etc .",
    "soi also leads to the possibility of electron transitions between landau levels in the magnetic field at the combined resonance frequencies @xcite , thus transitions being possible both in antinodes of electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "finally , operation of a spin transistor ( schemes of which have been considered in @xcite ) is based upon spin degrees of freedom .",
    "all of the above has determined elevated interest to investigations of the soi in 2d semiconductor structures .    for the purpose of studying the soi",
    ", it appears interesting to investigate a model in which the role of the soi should manifest itself the strongest . since the soi depends upon both translational and spin degrees of freedom , then it is a channel over which energy ( both electric and magnetic ) can be absorbed from the ultra - high frequency field , thus causing transitions between landau levels . because of that , it is interesting to investigate the response of a non - equilibrium electron system to a dc weak ( `` measurement '' ) electric field for the case when the initial non - equilibrium state is created with a high - frequency ac magnetic field that leads to combined transitions .",
    "the question is how this perturbation affects transport coefficients , in particular , the conductivity tensor .",
    "the discussed model includes the contributions form landau quantization and ( in the long - wavelength limit ) from the microwave radiation .",
    "we consider impurity centers for the role of scatterers , treating the scattering process perturbatively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system under consideration consists of the kinetic energy @xmath2 , zeeman energy @xmath3 in the magnetic field @xmath4 , the spin - orbit interaction @xmath5 , interactions of electrons with ac magnetic and dc electric fields and with impurities , and the hamiltonian of the impurities themselves : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 are operators of the components of the spin and kinetic momentum of the @xmath11th electron , where @xmath12 = -i\\delta_{ij } m \\hbar\\omega_c\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta z}$ ] , @xmath13 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath14 is bohr magneton .    in this paper , we limit our consideration to the case when ac and dc magnetic fields are parallel to each other : @xmath15 . in this case , the hamiltonian of the interaction of electrons with the ac magnetic field has the form : @xmath16    we assume the specific form of the soi term , namely , rashba interaction , which is non - zero even in the linear order in momentum : @xmath17 @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the constant characterizing the soi , @xmath20 is the fully - antisymmetric levi  chivita tensor .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction leads to correlation of spatial and spin motion of electrons , thus , the translational and spin - related subsystems are not well - defined . since the soi is in some sense small ,",
    "then one can perform a momentum - dependent canonical transformation that decouples kinetic and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "all other terms in the hamiltonian , describing the interaction of electrons with the lattice and external fields also undergo the transformation . in this case",
    ", the effective interaction of electrons in the system with external fields appears , which leads to resonant absorption of the field energy not only at the frequency of the paramagnetic resonance @xmath21 or cyclotron resonance @xmath22 , but also at their linear combinations .",
    "the gauge - invariant theory describing such transitions has been developed in @xcite .",
    "assuming the soi to be small , we perform the canonical transformation of the hamiltonian . up to the terms linear in @xmath23",
    ", we have : @xmath24.\\ ] ] the operator of the canonical transformation @xmath25 has to be determined from the requirement that , after the transformation , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 subsystems become independent .",
    "this requirement , as one can easily see , is satisfied if one puts @xmath28    one can write the transformed hamiltonian in the following form : @xmath29,\\ ] ] @xmath30 the effective interaction of the electrons and the ac magnetic field ( responsible for combined transitions ) can be found using the explicit expression for the operator @xmath23 : @xmath31 = \\frac{i\\alpha\\omega_{1s}}{2(\\omega_c - \\omega_s ) } ( t^{+- } - t^{-+})\\cos \\omega t,\\ ] ] @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the intensity of the linearly polarized magnetic field , oscillating with the frequency @xmath35 according to the cosine law .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) that the effective interaction @xmath36 leads to combined transitions at frequency @xmath37 , while the interaction of the spin degrees of freedom of the conductivity electrons with the ac magnetic field @xmath38 leads to resonant transitions at the frequency @xmath21 . since , for our further calculations , the response of the non - equilibrium system to the measurement electric field is interesting , in which the contribution from the translational degrees of freedom dominates , we will restrict our consideration to the effective interaction solely .    during the calculation of the non - equilibrium response of the electron system to the measurement electric field",
    ", there are technical difficulties cased by the dependence of the effective interaction @xmath36 upon time .",
    "one can avoid them by transferring the time dependence to the impurity subsystem .",
    "this can be done by means of a new canonical transformation .",
    "the explicit form of the canonical transformation @xmath39 is determined from the requirement that it excludes @xmath36 from the effective hamiltonian of a system without impurities : @xmath40 the operator @xmath39 is expressed in the following form : @xmath41 the operator @xmath42 is searched for in the form : @xmath43 where one has to determine the parameters @xmath44 . in the linear approximation in the constant of the spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "we have : @xmath45    as a result of the canonical transformation @xmath39 , renormalization of the electron - impurity interaction happens . in the case of elastic scattering , for obtaining the renormalized hamiltonian of the electron - impurity interaction ,",
    "it is sufficient to calculate @xmath46 . in the linear approximation in the constant of the spin - orbit interaction @xmath19",
    ", we obtain : @xmath47 using the explicit form of @xmath44 , we have : @xmath48 the speed of the electron momentum change is : @xmath49 where @xmath50    as one can see from ( [ ei ] ) , the renormalized electron - impurity interaction hamiltonian acquired time dependence . in",
    "such canonically transformed system , impurities act as a coherent oscillating field that leads to resonant transitions .",
    "we assume that the initial non - equilibrium state of the system under consideration is created by the ultra - high frequency magnetic field and can be described with the distribution @xmath51 . if some additional perturbation acts upon the system , then a new non - equilibrium state is formed in the system , that requires an extended set of basis operators for its description .",
    "the new non - equilibrium distribution is described with the operator @xmath52 .",
    "the task is to find the response of a non - equilibrium system to a weak measurement field .",

    "now we expand the formula ( [ t1 ] ) using the explicit expression for the renormalized electron - impurity interaction @xmath57 . inserting the explicit expression for the electron - impurity interaction and averaging over the system of scatterers ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath58 \\rho_q^{1-\\lambda } \\}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    here @xmath59 is the impurity concentration . rewriting this expression using secondary quantization and averaging the fermi operators using wick s theorem , we have : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fermi  dirac distribution . @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the electron states in the dc magnetic field , they are characterized by the landau level number @xmath64 , @xmath65 projection of the wave wector @xmath66 , and @xmath67 projection of the spin @xmath68",
    ".    then we should integrate over @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and take the limit @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( because we are interested in the zero - frequncy response ) .",
    "for the correction to the momentum relaxation rate caused by the microwave radiation , we obtain : @xmath74 in the @xmath75 limit , we obtain : @xmath76 the equation ( [ t7 ] ) contains a singularity in its right hand side , which is removed , as usual , due to broadening of the landau levels by scattering electrons on impurities : @xmath77 the landau level width @xmath78 can be expressed via the electron mobility @xmath63 in zero magnetic field : @xmath79    integrating over the energy for the case @xmath80 , we have : @xmath81    calculating the matrix element in ( [ t7 ] ) on the wave functions @xmath82 we obtain : @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the cyclotron orbit center coordinate , @xmath85 is the magnetic length , @xmath86 denotes hermite polynomials , and @xmath87 is the eigenfunction of the @xmath67 spin projection .    finally , integrating over @xmath88",
    ", we have : @xmath89    thus , for the case of point scatterers , where @xmath90 does not depend on @xmath91 , the radiation - induced correction to the inverse relaxation time is : @xmath92",
    "using the expression for the momentum relaxation rate , one can also write the formula for the diagonal components of the conductivity tensor @xmath93 . numerical calculations have been carried out with the following parameters : @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is the free electron mass ) , the fermi energy is @xmath96  mev , the mobility of the 2d electrons varies as @xmath97  @xmath1/vs , the electron density @xmath98  @xmath99 .",

    ".    .,width=377 ]    one can see that the dependence of electron mobility upon the magnetic field has the oscillating character .",
    "the response of a non - equilibrium electron system to the dc electric measurement field has been studied for the case when the initial non - equilibrium state of the system is created by an ultra - high frequency magnetic field that leads to combined transitions . within the proposed theory ,",
    "it has been shown that such perturbation of the electron system essentially influences the transport coefficients and leads to the oscillations of the diagonal components of the conductivity tensor .",
    "the discussed effect is analogous to the phenomenon observed in gaas / algaas heterostructures with ultra - high electron mobility @xcite .",
    "however , unlike that phenomenon , the manifestation of the oscillatory pattern is dictated by the spin - orbit interaction existing in the crystals under consideration ."
