    "a long - term monitoring project aimed at asteroseismology of a large sample of slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars and @xmath0cephei stars was started by researchers of the institute of astronomy of the university of leuven several years ago .",
    "this initiative started after a number of new pulsating b stars had been discovered from the hipparcos mission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0cephei stars are short period ( 38h ) pulsating variables of spectral type o9 to b3 ( 820m@xmath3 ) along the main sequence with low - order pressure ( p ) and/or gravity ( g ) modes .",
    "spb stars are situated in the h - r diagram just below the @xmath0cephei stars .",
    "they are less massive ( 39m@xmath3 ) b - type stars which show variability with periods of the order of one day due to multiperiodic high - order low - degree g mode oscillations .",
    "thanks to the hipparcos mission the number of spb stars increased from 12 to more than 80 @xcite .",
    "the study of the pulsation properties of spb and @xmath0cephei stars requires observations with a long time - base .",
    "indeed , modes with closely spaced periods occur . as was pointed out by @xcite , it is difficult to interpret and explore these multiplets in view of the unknown internal rotation law @xmath4 and given the dense theoretically predicted frequency spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that high - order g modes are a probe of the internal magnetic field .",
    "their calculations show that frequency splittings of the order of 1% may be due to a poloidal field with a strength of order 100 kg , buried in the deep interior of the star .",
    "@xcite made the first discovery of a magnetic field in an spb star .",
    "it concerned @xmath2cas whose dominant pulsation mode has a period p=1.56d .",
    "the two other detections of a magnetic field in pulsating b stars have been done for @xmath0cephei stars : @xmath0cep @xcite and v2052oph @xcite .",
    "the measured mean longitudinal magnetic fields in all three stars are weak , less than 100 g .",
    "these discoveries motivated us to perform a systematic search for magnetic fields in spb and @xmath0cephei stars , which started in 2003 with fors1 at the vlt .",
    "our recent measurements in the hydrogen lines of various types of stars of intermediate mass demonstrated that magnetic fields can be measured with an error bar as small as 20 g @xcite , enabling us to diagnose even very weak mean longitudinal fields .",
    "while the last spectropolarimetric data for our program have been released and reduced only in the last months , preliminary results of the survey were already presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the whole sample and discuss the results of more than 80 magnetic field measurements .",

    ", we used the grism600b in the wavelength range 34805890 to cover all hydrogen balmer lines from h@xmath0 to the balmer jump .",
    "the highest spectral resolution of the fors1 spectra achieved with this setting is @xmath22 . as of april 2005",
    ", we used the grism1200 g to cover the h balmer lines from h@xmath0 to h@xmath23 , and the narrowest available slit width of 0@xmath244 to obtain a spectral resolving power of @xmath25 .",
    "usually , we took four to eight continuous series of two exposures for each sample star using a standard readout mode with high gain ( a,1@xmath261,high ) and with the retarder waveplate oriented at two different angles , + 45@xmath27 and @xmath2845@xmath27 .",
    "for the observations carried out in 2005 , we used a non - standard readout mode with low gain ( a,1@xmath261,low ) , which provided a broader dynamic range and increased the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of individual spectra by a factor of @xmath292 .",
    "all sample stars are bright and , since the errors of the measurements of the polarization with fors1 are determined by photon counting statistics , a s / n ratio of a few thousand was reached within @xmath3030min .",
    "more details on the observing technique with fors 1 can be found elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "determination of the longitudinal magnetic field using the fors1 spectra is achieved by measuring the circular polarization of opposite sign induced in the wings of hydrogen balmer lines by the zeeman effect .",
    "the mean longitudinal magnetic field is the average over the stellar hemisphere visible at the time of observation of the component of the field parallel to the line of sight , weighted by the local emergent spectral line intensity .",
    "it is diagnosed from the slope of a linear regression of @xmath31 versus the quantity @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the stokes parameter which measures the circular polarization , @xmath34 is the intensity observed in unpolarized light , @xmath35 is the effective land factor , @xmath20 is the wavelength , @xmath36 is the derivative of stokes @xmath34 , and @xmath37 is the mean longitudinal field .",
    "our experience from a study of a large sample of magnetic and non - magnetic ap and bp stars revealed that this regression technique is very robust and that detections with @xmath38 result only for stars possessing magnetic fields .",
    "the mean longitudinal magnetic field @xmath37 of the targets is listed in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the rms longitudinal field is computed from all @xmath39 measurements according to : @xmath40 further we give the reduced @xmath41 for these measurements in column  5 , which is a statistical discriminant useful to assess the presence of a magnetic field @xcite , defined as : @xmath42 a longitudinal magnetic field at a level larger than 3@xmath43 has been diagnosed for 13 spb stars : hd3379 , hd45284 , hd53921 , hd74195 , hd74560 , hd85953 , hd140873 , hd160124 , hd161783 , hd169820 , hd181558 , hd208057 , and hd215573 .",
    "the star hd208057 has a rather high @xmath19 value and was classified as a be star by @xcite due to the detection of double emission in h@xmath44 . although the emissison was not confirmed in later observations , it can not be ruled out that this star is a be star .",
    "given the still uncertain status of the magnetic field discovered by @xcite in @xmath45ori , hd208057 is possibly the first be star with a magnetic field detected at 3@xmath43 level .",
    "most stars with multiple measurements have @xmath46 .",
    "the individual measurements show the variability of their magnetic field .",
    "the time scales of these variations are uncertain due to too few measurements being obtained for each star .",
    "unfortunately , also the rotational variability of the magnetic field can not be proven as the rotational periods are not known for any of these targets . for the spb star hd181558 with the largest number of magnetic field measurements ( six in all ) we searched for a correlation between the changes of the magnetic field with the pulsation period , but no clear correlation",
    "could be detected .",
    "the magnetic field of @xmath1cma is detected at more than 6@xmath43 level .",
    "both measurements carried out on two nights separated by about one month are of the order of 300 g . in fig.[fig1 ] we present stokes i and v spectra and the regression detection .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric observations revealed that @xmath1cma pulsates monoperiodically and non - linearly in a radial mode with a period of 0.209574 days , with a velocity amplitude of 33kms@xmath47 @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed an abundance analysis of nine selected @xmath0cephei stars and discovered @xmath1cma to be nitrogen enriched , as well as the three @xmath48cephei stars @xmath49cet , v2052oph , and @xmath0cep .",
    "it is remarkable that two of them , v2052oph and @xmath0cep , also have a detected longitudinal magnetic field of the order of @xmath30100 g @xcite .",
    "@xmath1cma shows the largest mean longitudinal field by a factor of three among these three @xmath0cephei stars .",
    "unfortunately , no search for a magnetic field has been attempted yet for @xmath49 cet .",
    "these four stars have another common property : they are either radial pulsators ( @xmath1cma ) or their multiperiodic pulsations are dominated by a radial mode ( @xmath49cet , @xmath0cep , and v2052oph ) .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field in these stars might play an important role to explain these physical characteristics .     and",
    "@xmath50 , computed for main sequence models with @xmath51 of `` grid 2 '' in @xcite .",
    "the lower and upper dotted lines show the zams and tams , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines denote evolution tracks for stars with @xmath14= 15 , 12 , 9 , 6 , and 3@xmath52 .",
    "filled circles correspond to the stars with detected magnetic fields.,scaledwidth=44.0% ]    the position of the studied spb and @xmath0cephei stars in the h - r diagram is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "no clear picture emerges concerning the evolutionary stage of stars with detected magnetic fields .",
    "we have to note , however , that the uncertainties of the age of hot stars ( table  [ table1 ] , column  9 ) are very large . furthermore , the whole sample under study contains only 14 stars with detected magnetic fields , so there is a need for more magnetic field measurements to have a good statistics .",
    "no hints of relations between the magnetic field strength and other stellar parameters were found . despite our discovery ,",
    "the knowledge of the magnetic fields in pulsating b stars remains very incomplete .",
    "magnetic fields are known to play an important role in the theoretical interpretation of the pulsations in cool rapidly oscillating ap stars .",
    "it is difficult to explain why non - pulsating chemically peculiar hot bp stars and pulsating stars co - exist in the spb and @xmath0cephei instability strips .",
    "it is especially intriguing that the magnetic fields of hot bp stars either do not show any detectable variations or vary with periods close to one day , which is of the order of the pulsation period range of spb stars @xcite .",
    "the presented magnetic field measurements in 13 spb stars and in the @xmath0cephei star @xmath1cma demonstrate that longitudinal magnetic fields in these stars are rather weak in comparison to the kg fields detected in magnetic bp stars .",
    "although the magnetic field determination method based on circular polarized fors1 spectra of hydrogen balmer lines shows the excellent potential of fors1 for the detection of weak fields , it would be particularly important to measure the fields with higher resolution spectropolarimeters , not only using hydrogen lines but also lines of other chemical elements to be able to study the field configuration at high confidence level .",
    "the role of the detected magnetic fields in the modelling of the oscillations of b - type stars remains to be studied .",
    "the magneto - acoustic coupling in pulsating b stars will be far less important than for the roap stars .",
    "the effect on the p modes of the @xmath0cephei stars is expected to be small @xcite but the g modes of the spb stars may be slightly affected , provided that the internal field strength is a factor 1000 larger than the detected value @xcite . in any case ,",
    "magnetic breaking and angular momentum transport along the field lines now offer a natural explanation of the slow rotation of our target stars ."
