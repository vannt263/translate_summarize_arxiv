    "the inference is that these galaxies may be only the tip of the iceberg of ultra - faint stellar systems in clusters .",
    "there are several possible formation pathways for udgs .",
    "they may be descendents of `` normal '' galaxies that have been altered within the cluster tidal field ( gnedin 2003 ) .",
    "alternatively , they may be `` tidal dwarfs '' , systems that were formed during galaxy interactions and then lost to the cluster potential to exist in a transient , free - floating phase ( bournaud  et al .  2007 ) .",
    "a third possibility is that they are ancient , remnant systems , perhaps either a species of `` peculiar dwarf '' or `` failed giant , '' depending upon their total masses .",
    "this last category could explain the survival of udgs in cluster environments , but would also imply that they are among the most dark - matter ( dm ) dominated galaxies in the universe , with mass - to - light ratios of @xmath20 within only 2  @xmath13(van dokkum  et al .",
    "2015b ) .",
    "determining total masses for udgs is clearly a priority for understanding their formation and evolutionary pathways .",

    "therefore , these gcs are not associated with the cluster potential , but rather belong to vcc  1287 .",
    "we use two approaches to estimate the gravitating mass of vcc  1287 , under the assumption that the gcs are in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "one is to assume that the velocity dispersion of the gcs is representative of the stars , allowing us to measure the mass of the system at the half - light radius of the galaxy . specifically , we determine the `` half - mass '' , @xmath71 , at one galaxy - light @xmath13  ( wolf  et al .",

    "the mass from the tme yields @xmath97 within 8.1 kpc .",
    "note that the uncertainty in the slope of the surface density profile has a relatively small affect on the inferred masses .",
    "for example , using @xmath98 rather than @xmath99 in equation  [ eq : watkins ]  reduces the calculated mass by @xmath90% .",
    "the above results indicate that both within 1  @xmath13 , and within 8.1 kpc , vcc  1287 has substantial dm . using the relations of ( zibetti  et al .",
    "2009 ) , assuming a kroupa initial mass function , we calculate a stellar mass , @xmath100  m@xmath5 .",

    "determination of the total ( virial ) mass of the dm halo gives insight into whether we are dealing with a dwarf or giant galaxy .",
    "since we can not dynamically measure any mass beyond the radius of the outermost gc ( newton s theorem ) , we rely on numerical simulations to infer the halo mass of vcc  1287 using our observations as constraints .",
    "we use the eagle simulations ( crain  et al .",

    "harris  et al .",
    "( 2013 ) obtained the remarkable result that the ratio of the total mass in gcs in a galaxy ( @xmath105 ) to the galaxy halo mass ( @xmath11 ) is constant over @xmath106 decades in galaxy luminosity , specifically , @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , _ the virial mass of a galaxy can be determined by totalling the mass in its gc system .",

    "this halo mass is in excellent agreement with our dynamical inference .",
    "much work in recent years has focused on the efficiency of star formation in dm halos of a given mass ( e.g. , behroozi  et al .  2013 ; moster  et al .",
    "2013 ; brook & di cintio 2015 ; tollet  et al .",
    "2015 ) . one way to quantify this is using the @xmath109 relation .",
    "this relation is shown in figure  [ fig : mstar_mhalo ] for our dynamically - based @xmath110 and for the counting gc - based @xmath11 for vcc  1287 and selected galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : mstar_mhalo ] shows that vcc  1287 is an outlier independent of the method used to determine @xmath11 .",
    "its location with respect to `` normal '' galaxies suggests that its stellar mass is very low for its halo mass . in this context ,",
    "vcc  1287 would need to have a stellar mass a factor of @xmath111 larger ( @xmath112 magnitudes brighter ) in order to be centred in these relations .",
    "we measure a stellar fraction ( @xmath113 ) of @xmath114 , whereas `` normal '' galaxies at this halo mass have @xmath115 .",
    "a halo - to - stellar mass ratio of @xmath60  3000 is unprecedented for any galaxy besides a dwarf spheroidal .",
    "it suggests that galaxy formation is highly stochastic for halo masses of @xmath116@xmath117 , with stellar masses varying by factors of 100 or more at fixed halo mass .",
    "this idea has been suggested as a solution to the problem of missing massive milky way satellites  the so - called `` too big to fail '' problem ( boylan - kolchin  et al .",
    "however , the stochastic solution has been generally rejected as implausible , with extreme stochasticity in simulations expected to set in at much lower masses ( brook & di cintio 2015 ; sawala  et al .  2015 ; wheeler  et al .",
    "2015 ) . the results for vcc  1287 raise the possibility that there are unidentified massive galaxies lurking at still lower surface brightnesses , and that these dm halos are _ not _ too big to fail .",
    "key questions are what is the formation history of this system , and is this typical of all udgs ?",
    "we reject the idea that vcc  1287 is a tidal - dwarf system , as these are expected to have total dm fractions of less than 10% ( bournaud  et al .",
    "we can not presently rule out that this is a tidally stripped system , but this interpretation is not favored by us .",
    "we see no obvious tidal features in our imaging .",
    "in addition , simulations suggest that in order to affect the stars and gcs , more than 90% of the dm must first be removed , and that the more spatially extended gc system is affected before the stars ( smith  et al .",
    "we have shown that vcc  1287 has an unusually rich system of gcs for its stellar mass , so any tidal mechanisms must preferentially remove stars over gcs .",
    "however , obtaining deeper imaging of this system in order to look for low surface brightness tidal features would be very useful .    in a general sense this may be a `` quenched '' system ( boselli  et al .",
    "2014 ) : perhaps a massive dwarf galaxy that had its star formation halted early due to gas starvation as it fell into the virgo cluster , and was therefore unable to grow in stellar mass as it has in dm . assuming old ( @xmath90 gyr ) stars in vcc  1287 ,",
    "then the galaxy colors suggest low metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath118 ( vazdekis  et al .  2010 ) .",
    "such low metallicity is expected in mass - metallicity relations ( e.g. , caldwell 2006 ) , and could be consistent with the early quenching of a dwarf - mass system .",
    "however , we note that the galaxy might have a younger luminosity - weighted age , which we can not rule out with our present photometry .    to address the question of whether vcc  1287 is typical of udgs , total masses for more udgs must be obtained .",
    "determining stellar velocity dispersions for these faint systems is expensive ( or impossible ) for 10m - class telescopes .",
    "here we have demonstrated a more inexpensive route through the kinematics of gc systems , at least for udgs out to virgo cluster distances .",
    "however , we suggest the most efficient approach comes from simply counting up the number of gcs in udgs .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the halo masses inferred from dynamics and from counting gcs for vcc  1287 , and this approach offers an inexpensive route to obtaining _",
    "virial masses for udg systems out to coma distances _",
    "( see also mihos  et al .",
    "for example , based on the calibrations of harris  et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , for `` dwarf - mass '' halos ( @xmath119  m@xmath5 ) we would expect @xmath605 gcs in a udg . for a quenched milky - way - like galaxy ( @xmath120  m@xmath5 ) we would expect @xmath121 gcs .",

    "<S> ultra diffuse galaxies ( udgs ) have the sizes of giants but the luminosities of dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> a key to understanding their origins comes from their total masses , but their low surface brightnesses ( @xmath0 25.0 ) generally prohibit dynamical studies . here </S>",
    "<S> we report the first such measurements for a udg ( vcc  1287 in the virgo cluster ) , based on its globular cluster system dynamics and size . from 7 gcs we measure a mean systemic velocity @xmath1 = 1071@xmath2 km / s , thereby confirming a virgo - cluster association . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a velocity dispersion of 33@xmath3 km / s within 8.1 kpc , corresponding to an enclosed mass of @xmath4 m@xmath5  and a @xmath6-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath7 . from the cumulative mass curve , along with the gc numbers , we estimate a virial mass of @xmath8  m@xmath5 , yielding a dark - to - stellar mass fraction of @xmath9 . we show that this udg is an outlier in @xmath10@xmath11 relations , suggesting extreme stochasticity in relatively massive star - forming halos in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how counting gcs offers an efficient route to determining virial masses for udgs . </S>"
