    "the simulations provide an estimate of the average energy of the axions emitted in the decay of the walls : @xmath105 when @xmath106 .    because of restrictions on the available lattice sizes , the simulations are for values of @xmath107 of order 100 , whereas in axion models of interest",

    "we have investigated the dependence of @xmath109 upon @xmath110 and found that it increases approximately as the logarithm of this quantity .",
    "this is because the decay process occurs in two steps : 1 ) wall energy converts into moving string energy because the wall accelerates the string , and the energy spectrum hardens accordingly ; 2 ) the strings annihilate into axions without qualitative change in the energy spectrum .",
    "if this behaviour persists all the way to @xmath111 , then @xmath112 for axion models of interest .",
    "this has interesting consequences for the axion cosmology and the cavity detector experiments of dark matter axion as discussed in ref .",
