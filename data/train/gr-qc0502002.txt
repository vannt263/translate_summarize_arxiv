    "the first generation of gravitational wave detectors is either already online and gathering scientific data ( ligo @xcite , geo600 @xcite , tama @xcite ) or about to start taking data ( virgo @xcite ) .",
    "ligo and geo600 have successfully completed several short data taking runs ( so called science runs ) in coincidence @xcite .",
    "tama has accumulated over 2000 hours of data @xcite and quite a big portion of this data was taken in coincidence with ligo and geo600 .",
    "all detectors are currently in the commissioning stage and are steadily approaching their design sensitivities .",
    "improvements in the performance of the detectors are carried out in several directions : ( i ) sensitivity improvements ( tracing and reducing noise level from different subsystems ) ( ii ) increasing duty cycle ( time spent in acquiring the data suitable for astrophysical analysis as a fraction of the total operational time ) , and ( iii ) improving the data quality ( stationarity ) .",
    "however , at the present state the data is neither stationary nor gaussian over time scales greater than few minutes .",
    "the detector output contains various spurious transient events .",
    "unfortunately , the output of an optimal filter reflects these events , especially various glitches . by glitch here",
    "we mean a short duration spurious transient ( of almost delta - function shape ) with a broad band spectrum that leads to a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the output of matched filtering .",
    "distinguishing these events from the real events of astrophysical origin and dropping them out of consideration is called vetoing .",
    "in addition to the main gravitational wave channel , interferometers record a large volume of auxiliary data from environmental monitors and various signals from the many detector subsystems . these monitors help to find correlations between abnormalities in environmental or in instrumental behaviour and events in the strain channel with high snr .",
    "the transients which correlate both in the strain and auxiliary channels ( occure in both within a coincidence window ) can be discarded on the ground of noise coupling between the strain channel and detector s subsystems ( provided we understand the physical reasons for such a coupling mechanism ) .",
    "this is what is regarded as instrumental vetoes .",
    "the instrumental vetoes are helpful for removing some fake events , however , it is not enough .",
    "we have other events which are of artificial nature , but the information which would help us to remove these events either was not recorded or is not recognised .",
    "so in addition to instrumental vetoes , we need to apply signal based vetoes : vetoes which are based on our knowledge about a signal s shape in the frequency- and/or time - domain . for signal based vetoes",
    ", we need to construct a statistic which helps us to discriminate false signals from the true ones .",
    "the @xmath0 time - frequency discriminator suggested in @xcite is an example of such a statistic .",
    "this vetoing statistic is used in a search for gravitational waves from the binary systems consisting of two compact objects ( neutron stars ( ns ) , black holes ( bh ) , ... ) orbiting around each other in an inspiralling trajectory due to loss of orbital energy and angular momentum through gravitational radiation .",
    "a lot of effort has been put into modeling the waveform from coalescing binaries @xcite .",
    "the waveforms ( often referred to as chirps ) are modelled with reasonable accuracy , so that matched filtering can be employed to search the data for these signals . in the case of the @xmath0 discriminator , we use the time - frequency properties of the chirp in order to discard ( to veto out ) any spurious event which produces an snr above a preset threshold on the matched filter output .",
    "the performance of @xmath0 might depend on the number of bins used in computing the statistic .",
    "in this paper we suggest a possible way to optimize the @xmath0 discriminator for the number of bins .",
    "we use software injections ( adding simulated signals ) into data taken by the geo600 detector during the first science run ( s1 ) in order to study the distribution of the @xmath0 statistic for simulated signals and for noise - generated events .",
    "the optimal number of bins is the one which maximizes detection probability for a given false alarm rate .",
    "this method is quite generic and can be used for tuning any vetoing statistic which depends on one or several parameters .",
    "though the @xmath0 discriminator works reasonably well , it is still desirable to have additional independent signal based vetoes , which would either increase our confidence or improve our ability to separate genuine events from spurious ones .",
    "some investigations have been already made in this direction @xcite .",
    "in addition to signal based vetoes , a heuristic veto method was suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is based on counting the number of snr threshold crossings within a short time window .    in this paper",
    "we suggest several new signal based statistics which can compliment @xmath0 or enhance its performance .",
    "we introduce a statistic inspired by the kolmogorov - smirnov `` goodness - of - fit '' test @xcite , we call it the @xmath1-statistic .",
    "we derive its probability distribution function in the case of signals buried in gaussian noise .",
    "we have also suggested a few other @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like statistics and show that their combination could increase vetoing efficiency even further .    throughout the paper",
    "we have used the following assumptions and simplifications .",
    "we shall assume that the waveforms used in our simulations , `` taylor '' approximants ( t1 ) at second post - newtonian order in the notations used in @xcite , are the exact representation of the astrophysical signal .",
    "the study performed in this paper is not restricted by the waveform model and could be repeated for any other model at the desirable post - newtonian order .",
    "the waveforms depend on several parameters , some of these parameters are intrinsic to the system like the masses and spins , while others are extrinsic like the time and phase of arrival of the gravitational wave signal . to search for such signals we use a bank of templates , which can be seen as a grid in the parameter space @xcite .",
    "separation of templates in the parameter space is defined by the allowed loss in the snr ( or equivalently by a loss in the detection probability ) .",
    "the detector output is usually filtered through a bank of templates for parameter estimation @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we have used a single template with parameters identical , or very close , to those of the signal used in the monte - carlo simulation described in section  [ iii ] .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start in section  [ ii ] by recalling the widely used @xcite @xmath0 time - frequency discriminator @xcite . in section  [ iii ] , we describe the method to optimize the @xmath0 veto for the number of bins . though we show its performance for @xmath0 optimization , the method is applicable to any discriminator which depends on some free parameters .",
    "section  [ iv ] is dedicated to alternative vetoing statistics . there",
    "we start with the @xmath1-statistic , then we show few more examples of @xmath1- and @xmath0-like statistics ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspondingly ) which can potentially increase the vetoing efficiency further . for instance we show that the combination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 statistics ( namely their product ) give the best performance for a day s worth geo600 data .",
    "we summarize main results in the concluding section  [ v ] and some detailed derivations are given in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the notation which will be used throughout the paper and we reformulate the @xmath0 discriminator @xcite using new notations . this should be useful in the following sections where we discuss @xmath0 optimization and alternative signal - based vetoing statistics .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the signal is of a known phase with known time of arrival without loss of generality .",
    "indeed , we can use phase and time of arrival taken from the maximization of snr .",
    "alternatively , one can extend the derivations below in a manner similar to @xcite to deal with the unknown phase .    the detector output sampled at @xmath4",
    "is denoted by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is noise and @xmath7 is a signal , which corresponds to the gravitational wave of amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "since we will be working mainly in the frequency domain , we use tilde - notation for a fourier image of the time series : @xmath9 .",
    "the discrete fourier transform is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a number of points .    in order to introduce the @xmath0 discriminator we need to define the following quantities    s_i & = & 2_f_k = f_i-1^f_i f , i= 1 ,  , n ; s = 2_f_k = f_0^f_n f , + q_i & = & _ f_k = f_i-1^f_i ( + c.c.)f , i= 1 ,  ,",
    "f_k = f_0^f_n ( + c.c.)f . note that this notation is different from that used in @xcite . here",
    "the one - sided noise power spectral density ( psd ) , @xmath13 , defined as @xmath14 is assumed to be known , @xmath15 as well as `` * '' mean complex conjugate and @xmath16 . we have chosen to work with discrete time and frequency series to be close to reality . here and after we use @xmath17 for the average over ensemble and @xmath18 for the second moment of the distribution .",
    "the frequency boundaries @xmath19 correspond to the frequency at which the gravitational wave signal enters the sensitivity band of the instrument and the frequency at the last stable orbit , @xmath20 is beyond the nyquist frequency , @xmath21 , @xmath22 should be taken as @xmath23 . ]",
    "( sometimes it is also referred to as the frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit ) . in this notations",
    "@xmath24 corresponds to the snr ( up to a numerical factor which does not play any role in the further analysis ) and @xmath25 is a part of the total snr accumulated in the frequency band between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we choose a normalization for the templates so that @xmath28 .",
    "let us emphasize again , that we have assumed that we know the phase and time of arrival , so they are incorporated in the definition of the waveform @xmath29 .    for the @xmath0 discriminator , we choose the frequency bands ( _ bins _ ) @xmath30 , so that there is an equal power of signal in each band : @xmath31 .",
    "then the @xmath0 discriminator can be written in the notations adopted here as follows    ^2 = n_k=1^n ( q_i - q / n)^2 . [ chi2 ] if the detector noise is gaussian , then the above statistic obeys a @xmath0 distribution with @xmath32 degrees of freedom .",
    "the main idea behind the @xmath0 discriminator is to split the template @xmath33 into sub - templates defined in different frequency bands , so that if the data contains the genuine gravitational wave signal , the contributions ( @xmath34 ) from each sub - template to the total snr ( @xmath24 ) are equal ( @xmath35 ) .    in the presence of a chirp in the data or",
    "if the data is pure gaussian noise , the value of @xmath0 is low @xmath36 .",
    "however , if the data contains a glitch which is not consistent with the inspiral signal , then the value of @xmath0 is large .",
    "this statistic is very efficient in vetoing all spurious events that cause large snr in the matched filter output .",
    "it was used in the search pipeline for setting an upper limit on the rate of coalescing ns binaries @xcite .",
    "if we want to apply this vetoing statistic in a binary bh search we should do some modifications of the @xmath0 discriminator eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) to increase its efficiency . in practice",
    ", it might be difficult to split @xmath37 in bands of exactly the same power @xmath38 for signals from high mass systems , in other words it might be difficult to achieve @xmath39 exactly . indeed , the bandwidth of the signal from binary bh decreases with increasing total mass , @xmath40 , where we used @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the total mass .",
    "in addition we work with a finite frequency resolution , which we might want to decrease to save computational time .",
    "finally , the accuracy of splitting the total frequency band depends on the number of bins .    based on this",
    "we suggest a modification of the @xmath0 discriminator , which does not change it statistical properties , but enhances its performance @xcite .",
    "we introduce @xmath43 which is close to @xmath44 , but not exactly equal to it",
    ". then we should redefine @xmath0 statistic according to    ^2 = _ i=1^n [ chi2mod ] we refer to @xcite for more details on this modification and its properties .",
    "in this section we would like to present a method for optimizing parameter - based vetoing statistics .",
    "this method also helps to tune the veto threshold for a signal based statistic .",
    "though the main focus in this section will be on the optimization of the @xmath0 statistic with respect to the number of bins , this method can also be applied to a general case ( see section  [ iv ] ) .",
    "first we need to define playground data .",
    "playground data is a small subset of the available data chosen to represent the statistical properties of the whole data set @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to use software injections of the chirps ( adding simulated signals ) into playground data and compare the distribution of @xmath0 for the injected signals and spurious events .",
    "there is a trade off between the number of software injections : on the one hand we should not populate the data stream with too many chirps as it will corrupt the estimation of psd , on the other hand the number of injections should not be too small , so that we can accumulate sufficiently large number of samples ( `` sufficiently large '' should be quantified , see @xcite ) .",
    "another issue is the amplitude of injected signals : the amplitude should be realistic , which means close to the snr threshold used for the search .",
    "parameters of the injected chirps ( such as masses , spins , etc . )",
    "should be either fixed ( optimization with respect to the particular signal ) or correspond to the range of parameters used for templates in the bank .",
    "a generalization could be optimization with respect to several ( group of ) signals and the use of different number of bins for different ( set of ) parameters .",
    "that could happen in reality : the search for binary ns and binary bh might have different optimal number of bins .    to ease our way through we give an example of the optimization of @xmath0 for signals from the @xmath45 system .",
    "we injected a waveform with mass parameters @xmath46 and snr=13 in each 5th segment of analyzed data .",
    "each segment was 16 seconds long .",
    "then 2.5 hours of geo600 s1 data was filtered through the template taylort1 ( at 2-nd post - newtonian order ) with mass parameters @xmath47 .",
    "the template taylort1 corresponds to `` t1 '' in @xcite . by having a slight mismatch in masses of the system ,",
    "we have tried to mimic a possible mismatch due to the coarseness of the template bank .",
    "we have separated triggers which correspond to the injected signals from the spurious events by using a 5 msec window around the time of injection .",
    "snr threshold was chosen to be 6 .",
    "then we have produced histograms for @xmath0 distribution for injected / detected signals and for spurious events .",
    "this procedure was performed for different number of bins for @xmath0 statistic .",
    "one can see the results in figure [ chi21 ] .",
    "the solid line histogram shows the distribution of @xmath0 for signals and the shaded histogram corresponds to the distribution of @xmath0 for spurious events with @xmath48 .",
    "we want the distribution of @xmath0 for injected signals be separated as much as possible from the distribution of @xmath0 for the spurious events .",
    "the optimal number of bins is the one which corresponds to the minimum overlap between those two distributions .",
    "one can see that for the case considered above the optimal number lies somewhere close to 20 .",
    "we need a more rigorous way to define the optimal number of bins , so that we need to quantify the overlap between the two distributions . here",
    "we will apply the standard detection technique @xcite .",
    "first we need to normalize the distributions @xmath49 ( corresponds to the distribution of @xmath0 for the injected signals ) and @xmath50 ( corresponds to the distribution of @xmath0 for the spurious events ) so that _ 0^+ p_1 ( ) d= 1 , _",
    "0^+p_2 ( ) d=1 .",
    "@xmath51 defines the false alarm probability distribution function , so that we can fix the false alarm probability according to    _ 0^(n)p_2(,n)d= . by fixing the false alarm probability @xmath52",
    ", we are essentially fixing the threshold , @xmath53 , on @xmath0 .",
    "note that the threshold is a function of the number of bins and the false alarm probability . for real data ,",
    "@xmath54 can not be computed analytically , since @xmath55 depends on spurious events , or , rather on the similarity of spurious events to the chirp signal .",
    "thus the purpose of the playground data is to characterize the non - stationarities in the data .",
    "_ we will call the number of bins optimal if for a given @xmath52 it maximizes the detection probability @xmath56 _    _ 0^(n , ) p_1(,n ) d= p_d . in other words , n_opt = max_n ( _ 0^(n , ) p_1(,n ) d ) .",
    "[ opt ] note , that we know @xmath49 only for chirps plus gaussian noise .",
    "the detector s noise , however , is not gaussian over a long time scale , so that @xmath57 is also , strictly speaking , unknown to us .",
    "this is why we have used software injections . as a bonus we also derived a threshold on @xmath0 , @xmath53 , which should be used in the analysis of the full data set .",
    "as one can see , this method can be applied to _ any _ signal based vetoing statistic . in section  [ iv ] we will apply this method to determine the efficiency of other statistics . as an example , we can apply eq .",

    "we have injected only 214 signals , and it might not be enough to make a definite statement .",
    "however it is a very good indication on what is the optimal number of bins .",
    "we have quite a large number ( 2550 ) of spurious events with @xmath48 , so that the statement about the threshold for a given false alarm probability is pretty solid .",
    "it should also be mentioned that we have truncated a tail of the @xmath0 distribution for spurious events by neglecting 5% of all events with largest @xmath0 ( we continue 5% truncation for false alarm distribution in the section  [ iv ] as well ) .",
    "we have also performed a cubic spline interpolation between these points ( see fig .",
    "[ splin ] ) to show that the optimal number of bins indeed lies somewhere close to 20 .    at the end of this section",

    "the main idea is to compare two cumulative functions : the cumulative signal power within the signal s frequency band and the cumulative snr , which is essentially the correlation between the detector output and a template within the same frequency band .",
    "introduce the vetoing statistic according to d= max_i|q_i - _ iq| , i= 1, ... ,m-1 [ d ] and let us call it @xmath1-statistic .",
    "however , we have found that , in practice , another statistic , @xmath2 : @xmath62 performs better .",
    "nevertheless we start with @xmath1-statistic and postpone consideration of @xmath2 to the next subsection .",
    "the main question which we want to address is what is the probability of @xmath63 in the presence of a true chirp in gaussian noise .",

    "the interesting fact is that the tama group @xcite is using a similar ( related to the inverse of this quantity ) statistic for the purpose of detection . in the following consideration",

    "the percentile value could be considered as a parameter for the @xmath1-statistic , and could be optimized for .",

    "[ altrd1 ] .",
    ", width=491,height=340 ]    the reason that the product of two statistics works even better than each of them separately could be because @xmath3 and @xmath2 might be better suited for different types of spurious events , and equally good for the true signals .",
    "the statistics in the product supplement each other to veto larger number of spurious events .",
    "we have tried to optimize @xmath78 with respect to the number of bins , following the same line and conducting similar simulations as described in the section  [ iii ] .",
    "however , we have not found the obvious choice for the optimal number of bins .",
    "this is because the detection probability as a function of the number of bins for @xmath79 fluctuates slightly about a constant value for the number of bins between 18 and 40 .",
    "in this paper we have considered several signal based vetoes . those are various statistics based on our knowledge of the signal we search for , which help us in discriminating genuine gravitational wave signal from spurious events of instrumental or environmental origin .",
    "we have outlined the method to optimize @xmath0-like statistic for the number of bins .",
    "this method is based on adding simulated signals to real data and studying the distribution of the vetoing statistic for injected signals and spurious events .",
    "the optimal number of bins is the one which maximizes the detection probability for a fixed false alarm probablity .",
    "this method also automatically provides us with the vetoing threshold .",
    "we have considered two other very promising signal based vetoes : @xmath3  the @xmath0-like discriminator , and @xmath2  the statistic which was inspired by the kolmogorov - smirnov `` goodness - of - fit '' test .",
    "using again simulated injections into geo600 s1 data we have shown that both those statistics could give a very high detection probability ( @xmath80% ) for a given false alarm probability ( 1% ) .",
    "we have also pointed out that we can achieve even better performance if we take the product of the two statistics as a new veto .",
    "finally , let us emphasize , that the results of the simulations presented here are data dependent , and the exact numbers for efficiency may vary for different detectors and/or for different data sets of the same detector .",
