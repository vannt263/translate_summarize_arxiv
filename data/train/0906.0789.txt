    "in recent years curve crossing problems regained considerable attention in contexts such as quantum information processing , superconducting mesoscopic circuits , or wave packet dynamics in molecular structures .",
    "the paradigmatic situation has been formulated by landau , zener , and stckelberg @xcite already during the heyday of quantum mechanics : the energy difference between the diabatic energy levels of two states , say @xmath0 and @xmath1 , changes linearly in time as @xmath2 with constant velocity @xmath3 through a crossing region while transitions between these states with frequency @xmath4 occur .",
    "the probability for staying in state @xmath0 in the infinite future when starting in @xmath0 in the infinite past is given by the famous landau - zener - stckelberg formula @xmath5 where the parameter @xmath6 controls whether the dynamics happens to be adiabatically ( @xmath7 ) or diabatically ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "various modifications of this original setting have been studied , in particular , situations where the diabatic energy levels vary due to the dynamics of an intrinsic degree of freedom . for condensed phase systems",
    "this degree of freedom typically interacts with a dissipative environment so that due to its diffusive dynamics the crossing region ( the so - called landau - zener range ) is not traversed ballistically but rather stochastically .",
    "one prominent example is the charge transfer between donor and acceptor states in molecular structures , a process which is of relevance for molecular electronics @xcite . here , in most cases",
    "environmental degrees of freedom are fast compared to electronic transitions meaning that one is close to the diabatic limit .",
    "important observables are then transfer rates between diabatic surfaces and time dependent populations on these surfaces . since in general exact analytical solutions are impossible ,",
    "approximate treatments have been developed e.g.  based on master equations @xcite .",
    "much less attention has been paid to the diffusive dynamics on adiabatic surfaces and the impact of non - adiabatic transitions .",
    "one realization of this situation can be found in mesoscopic physics , namely , in the charge transfer through atomic size contacts between superconducting leads @xcite .",
    "in fact , this device extends josephson weak links @xcite to junctions with variable transmissions even close to 1 with the relevant degree of freedom being again the phase difference between the superconducting reservoirs .",
    "theory shows @xcite that for an isolated contact with one channel the cooper pair current is carried by two andreev bound states the energy levels of which depend on the phase difference and the transmission probability @xmath9 of the channel . for perfect transmission ( @xmath10 )",
    "the minimal gap between the levels closes , while it tends towards the superconducting gaps in the reservoirs for @xmath11 .    for contacts embedded in an electrical circuit",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "first , the phase interacts with the electromagnetic modes of the surrounding and its dynamics becomes diffusive .",
    "second , the contact can be externally driven by a current or a voltage bias .",
    "the charge transfer is then a combination of cooper pair tunneling , responsible for a supercurrent peak , and multiple andreev reflections ( mars ) @xcite , responsible for quasi - particle transfer leading to a rich subgap structure .",
    "the first process dominates for low voltages , the second one for higher voltages , while in a crossover region a subtle interplay of both processes appears @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the current biased situation .",
    "then , the phase diffuses on tilted andreev levels which constitute the adiabatic levels of the system . due to the small capacitance of the contact and the large admittance of the circuit the brownian motion of the corresponding fictitious particle",
    "is overdamped so that this adiabatic approximation is justified .",
    "the theoretical framework to calculate averages of supercurrent and voltage , respectively , follows that of overdamped josepshon junctions according to ambegaokar , halperin @xcite and ivanchenko , zilbermann @xcite .",
    "ac - driven atomic point contacts have been treated in the same way in @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this picture has been verified e.g.  by measuring the supercurrent peak and its maximum ( switching current ) as functions of temperature @xcite .",
    "problems arise , however , close to the ballistic limit ( @xmath9 close to 1 ) , when the minimal gap between the adiabatic levels becomes comparable to typical diffusion times .",
    "consequently , nonadiabatic transitions enter the game .",
    "note that these transitions can also be interpreted as the precursors of mars . in @xcite",
    "the standard landau - zener - stckelberg formula has been applied to correct for those transitions , but failed to capture the experimental data . in this paper",
    "we provide a consistent theory which accounts for the overdamped brownian motion on coupled adiabatic surfaces .",
    "such a theory may in turn be of relevance in other contexts as well and particularly allows to calculate steady state currents and diffusive transition rates between _ adiabatic _ surfaces .",
    "for atomic point contacts its only limitation is that mars are not included explicitly in the theory so that the full crossover between supercurrent peak and the subgap structure can not be described . for this case",
    "( and a voltage biased contact ) an effective approach has been outlined recently in @xcite , which , however , is still somewhat _ ad - hoc _ as it combines a microscopic description of the mars without environmental modes and the phase dynamics in presence of the circuit modes .",

    "one gains the supercurrent voltage characteristics @xmath43 .",
    "the adiabatic treatment is based on a separation of time scales , which may become critical in certain ranges of parameter space .",
    "the goal of the next two sections is to derive formally exact equations of motion for the density matrix in the adiabatic basis of the two level system thus including nonadiabatic transitions between them .",

    "the diabatic surfaces in this situation are assumed to be harmonic so that the system , starting initially from the donor state , relaxes towards thermal equilibrium in the long time limit .    in the present problem",

    "for instance , for an atomic point contact the lz range is located around @xmath17 where @xmath105 . as a consequence , the adiabatic approximation breaks down for @xmath106 and the dynamics of the density matrix follows from the full set of equations only . as in case of the diabatic equations ( [ wfp ] ) , a direct numerical evaluation of ( [ adia_wfp ] ) is in most cases prohibitive though .",
    "namely , the off - diagonal elements @xmath107 tend to oscillate strongly for increasing @xmath108 , i.e. away from the lz - domain .",
    "physically , this reflects the fact that these off - diagonal elements are relevant only in a domain around the lz point @xmath103 , while outside they are effectively washed out .",
    "the idea to proceed in the overdamped limit is thus similar as in the diabatic representation : one formally solves for the localized dynamics of @xmath109 and @xmath110 and inserts these results into the equations for the diagonal elements .",

    "system information is carried by the dynamical susceptibility @xmath131 , the imaginary part of which becomes in the strong friction limit independent of the local oscillator frequency @xmath132 and @xmath133 thus , we see from ( [ adiab_wsg ] ) that the nonadiabatic coupling between the adiabatic surfaces contains in addition to the landau - zener factor @xmath99 dynamical information in terms of the power spectrum of the momentum correlations at the local transition frequency @xmath134 between the adiabatic surfaces .",
    "since the relevant domain for transitions is the lz range where the gap between the adiabatic surfaces becomes small , one has @xmath135 and in most cases also @xmath136 which justifies the high temperature analysis given above .",

    "note that in this latter limit @xmath164 diverges .",
    "the above restriction can also be understood from a different point of view .",
    "namely , the approach discussed here has to assume that the instantaneous voltage @xmath165 produced when the phase diffuses with finite velocity through the lz range is sufficiently smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath13 so that the massive production of quasi - particles is suppressed .",

    ", we will provide arguments why this strategy is justified and to what extent the latter ones may appear in the theory .",
    "the classical smoluchowski theory requires not only strong friction @xmath59 but also @xmath194 .",
    "the opposite limit where the quantum scale for friction by far exceeds the thermal energy scale , i.e.  @xmath195 , has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the essence is this : in the so - called quantum smoluchowski regime to leading order the classical smoluchowski equation still applies .",
    "quantum fluctuations appear in form of a modified diffusion coefficient @xmath196 $ ] where @xmath197 for @xmath195 .",
    "typically , @xmath198 is small and describes deviations of equilibrium fluctuations in position from its classical value @xmath199 .",
    "in contrast to this squeezing in position , fluctuations in momentum are large and fully quantum mechanical in agreement with the uncertainty principle .",
    "it is thus justified even for @xmath195 to use at least to leading order the classical smoluchowski equation for the dynamics in position , but the quantum version of the momentum - momentum correlation . to next order",
    ", quantum fluctuations in position are accounted for by the above replacement of the diffusion coefficient in ( [ adiab_wsg ] ) .",
    "one may wonder in which regime , classical or quantum , superconducting point contacts are operated .",
    "for this purpose one realizes that @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the charging energy and @xmath202 with @xmath203 @xcite . in the overdamped limit one always has @xmath204 . for a contact with a capacitance in the ff range and @xmath28 of the order of 200@xmath205 one then gets @xmath206 40/t[k ] so that even for temperatures of a few k , we have @xmath207 .",
    "the conclusion is that the phase dynamics of the junction is taking place in the quantum smoluchowski regime .",
    "we note that quantum fluctuations correspond here to charging effects and display coulomb blockade physics @xcite .",
    "question is why this has not been observed yet .",
    "there are two answers . the first one is based on the above argument that even in this regime to leading order everything is classical .",
    "the second one is based on an analysis of the real circuitry . there",
    ", additional capacitances @xmath208 of typically a few pf are placed in parallel to the weak link meaning that it sees a more complex admittance with additional voltage fluctuations .",
    "these latter ones are classical since @xmath209 and may mask the quantum fluctuations .",
    "if either or both of these arguments apply needs a more careful study of the experimental situation and goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "anyway , atomic point contacts may be ideal test - beds to tune an overdamped system between its classical and quantum regimes .",
    "we developed a consistent approach to describe in the regime of strong friction non - adiabatic transitions between adiabatic surfaces .",
    "this results in a set of coupled equations of motion for the adiabatic populations ( [ adiab_wsg ] ) , which may be of use in a broad range of contexts . an explicit expression for the transition rate reveals that the strength of these transition is controlled by the inverse of a lz - type of factor measuring the diabatic forces at the lz - point relative to the energy gap between the adiabatic levels and the momentum - momentum correlation .",
    "explicit results are obtained for high transmitting superconducting atomic point contacts . in particular , the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the maximal supercurrent is qualitatively explained .",
    "the classical theory may be extended to include quantum fluctuations .",
