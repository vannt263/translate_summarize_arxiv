    "the following quantities are obtained from the fit to the observed integrated intensities : hydrogen nucleus number density n(h)@xmath10 ; total clump mass within the beam m@xmath11 ; fuv field in draine units @xmath12 ; hydrogen ionization rate due to cosmic - rays @xmath13(h ) ; clump ensemble mass lower limit m@xmath14 ; and clump ensemble mass upper limit m@xmath15 .",
    "the model intensities can reproduce the observed intensities extremely well in almost all cases within error bars , except for the co(1 - 0 ) transition where the model systematically underestimates observations by a factor of @xmath8 2 - 3 .",

    "* abel et al.(2005 ) ) . when compared with the observed intensities in and around the arched - filaments location , their predictions for solar and under - solar metallicities do not match the data .",
    "the observations show that the great majority of the integrated intensity [ cii]/[nii ] ratios ( calculated between @xmath1670 and @xmath1720 ) are fairly homogeneously distributed over the map for values below 10 .",
    "calculations including variations in the [ c / n ] abundance ratio and stellar clusters seds can explain the observed scatter in the [ cii ] vs. [ nii ] plot and suggest that , in order to use the [ nii ] intensity to disentangle the [ cii ] component arising from h ii regions , tight constraints are needed on the [ c / n ] abundance ratio , significantly tighter than previous abundance measurements have discerned .",
    "our preliminary results show that the gas is exposed to a relatively low @xmath12 , between 10@xmath0 - 10@xmath1 draine fields , with n(h)@xmath10 well constrained between 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath13(h ) values vary between 10@xmath5 and 4@xmath610@xmath5 s@xmath7 , with the highest value @xmath8 10@xmath9 s@xmath7 found towards g0.07 + 0.04 . the model results ( specially for n(h)@xmath10 and @xmath12 ) , for all positions as a function of projected distance from the arches cluster , show a large dispersion suggesting that the true distance to the cluster must have a significant line of sight component .",
    "combining all these results puts constraints on the 3-d spatial distribution , 3-d density structure , and hydrogen ionization rate due to cosmic - rays in the arched - filaments .",
