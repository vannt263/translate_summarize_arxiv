    "many , but not all , have unusually broad radio recombination lines ( rrls ) with full widths at half maximum intensity ( fwhm ) @xmath9 40 km s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "hc hii regions have rising spectral indices @xmath0 ( where @xmath13 ) from centimeter to millimeter wavelengths with typical values of @xmath141 , which suggests a range of densities and optical depths in the ionized gas .",
    "broad rrls ( brrls ) and intermediate sloped ( @xmath15 ) power - law spectral indices may be associated with the age of hc hii regions , appearing only during a small fraction of the lifetime of the hypercompact phase .",
    "there are very dense and compact hii regions , however , that do not have intermediate power - law spectral energy distributions or broad radio recombination lines ( e.g. , g34.26@xmath10.15 a , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although possibly related to the age , the physical reason that some hc hii regions do not present brrls is poorly understood .",
    "the broad linewidths suggest highly dynamic internal structures ( e.g. , bipolar outflows , expansion , stellar winds , accretion , disk rotation , shocks ) as well as electron impact ( pressure ) broadening .",
    "high spatial resolution observations over a wide range of frequencies are required to distinguish the relative contributions from pressure broadening and bulk motion of the gas .",
    "transitions with high principal quantum numbers , @xmath16 , are significantly affected by pressure broadening , while low @xmath16 transitions are mostly free of pressure broadening and are sensitive to large - scale motions . with high spatial resolution at a range of frequencies ,",
    "it is possible to distinguish bulk motions from pressure broadening .",
    "observations have shown that both pressure broadening and gas dynamics contribute to line broadening @xcite .",
    "theoretical progress has been made towards understanding the nature of hc hii regions .",
    "the model of hierarchical clumping of the nebular gas proposed by @xcite was able to reproduce the intermediate values of spectral indices seen in hc hii regions . @xcite and @xcite proposed models that predict both confinement of the ionized gas in hc hiis and the brrl emission .",

    "additional rrls were observed to search for systematic broadening with increasing principal quantum number .",

    "figure  [ nfwhm]a shows that the lines from hc hii regions ( except g34.26 a ) , particularly the lower - frequency transitions , are too broad to be the result of a combination of thermal and turbulent broadening only . if an electron temperature of 10,000 k and turbulent velocity of 5 km s@xmath12 are assumed , the contribution from thermal and turbulent motions to the line widths would be only @xmath622 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the change in line width with transition apparent in figure  [ nfwhm]a strongly suggests that pressure broadening is a dominant broadening mechanism .",
    "owing to the rapid change of pressure broadening with principal quantum number @xmath16 ( fwhm of pressure broadening @xmath78 ; @xcite ) , the lower - frequency lines are affected much more strongly by pressure broadening than the higher - frequency lines . at high frequencies , pressure broadening becomes negligible , thus line widths should be dominated by thermal , turbulent , and bulk motions .",
    "even though pressure broadening depends so strongly on @xmath16 , accurate adherence to the @xmath79 dependence is not expected because of other dependences on electron density and electron temperature , which vary within hii regions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the two continuum images for each region ( 1.3 cm and 2 cm for g10.96 ; 7 mm and 2 cm for g28.20 ) were convolved to a common resolution before measuring the flux densities . for g10.96 w , the 1.3 cm and 2 cm flux densities of 296@xmath1915 mjy and 288@xmath1915 mjy , respectively , give a spectral index of + ( 0.07@xmath190.17 ) , indicating that this source is in the optically thin regime .",
    "the 7 mm and 2 cm flux densities of g28.20 n are 723@xmath1937 mjy and 490@xmath1925 mjy , respectively , indicating a spectral index of @xmath1(0.4@xmath190.1 ) .",
    "this value suggests that the hii region has a turnover wavelength in the 2 cm  7 mm range . the flux density distribution for g28.20 n , based on high - resolution interferometric observations covering the wavelength range from 6 cm to 1.3 mm , is shown in fig .",
    "[ g28sed ] .",
    "the plot shows the spectrum becoming optically thin in the 20  50 ghz range .",
    "we found that g28.20 n is very similar to the well - studied hc hii region g24.78@xmath10.08",
    "a1 @xcite in terms of physical properties , kinematics ( rotation , infall , outflow ) , morphology ( shell - like ) , and association with masers .",
    "the flux density distributions of these sources are similar in terms of the shape and the turn - over frequency ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ g28sed ] ) .",
    "neither of these hc hii regions has a rising spectrum to millimeter wavelengths ( as do g9.62 + 0.19 e and g75.78 + 0.34 ( h@xmath22o ) , see @xcite ) .",
    "the shell - like morphology appears to be a common feature of the hc hii regions .",
    "besides g28.20 n and g24.78@xmath10.08 a1 , the a and b components in g34.26 , and also g45.07 ne , show a shell morphology in high resolution images reported by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we investigated the distribution of maser emission in msfrs from our sample .",
    "we found that maser emission is only detected toward sources with broad rrls ( typically the most compact and dense sources in the uc / hc hii region complexes ) : g10.96 w , g28.20 n , g34.26 b and c , and g45.07 ne .    in figure [ g28masers ]",
    "we show the maser positions for g28.20 n overlaid on the continuum and thermal molecular line emission .",
    "the oh masers are distributed linearly over a region @xmath61@xmath34 ( or @xmath60.04 pc ; figure  [ g28masers]a ) with a velocity gradient of @xmath6150 km s@xmath12 pc@xmath12 .",
    "the velocities increase from @xmath694 km s@xmath12 at the north - western end of the linear feature to @xmath6100 km s@xmath12 at the south - eastern end .",
    "the small cluster of maser spots north of the south - eastern end has a velocity of @xmath695 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the 1.3 cm image ( figure [ g28masers]c ) , with 20@xmath20 higher angular resolution than the 7 mm image ( figure  [ g28masers]a ) , shows the oh masers situated along the south - western boundary of the continuum source , at the edge of the ch@xmath23cn emission ( figure  [ g28masers]d ) .",
    "the location of the oh masers suggests that they arise within a molecular shell surrounding the ionized gas .",
    "the oh maser velocities in g28.20 n roughly agree with the ch@xmath62cn velocity of @xmath695 - 96 km s@xmath12 ; however , they are redshifted relative to the hii region velocity of @xmath693 km s@xmath12 estimated by the systemic velocity of the highest frequency rrl observed toward g28.20 n ( h30@xmath0 at 1.3 mm , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar redshift is seen for ch@xmath23oh masers , detected over the velocity range 94  105 km s@xmath12 .",
    "these redshifts for oh and ch@xmath23oh masers , together with the fact that they appear projected against the optically thick continuum , suggest that they arise on the near side of g28.20 n , thus supporting the scenario that the masers are located in a collapsing molecular envelope surrounding the hii region .",
    "a similar scenario was proposed for w3(oh ) @xcite and several other uc hii regions ( including g34.26 c , and g45.07 ne ; @xcite ) based on the maser and radio continuum emission in those regions .",
    "this interpretation can also apply to g10.96 w from our sample , where the two ch@xmath23oh maser spots are near the continuum emission peak , and have velocities ( @xmath625 km s@xmath12 ; @xcite ) redshifted by @xmath614 km s@xmath12 relative to the h66@xmath0 velocity ( see table  [ tabfits ] ) .",
    "the oh maser velocities in g28.20 n appear to be inconsistent with the velocity gradient reported for the h53@xmath0 line by @xcite . in particular , the h53@xmath0 velocity gradient , when extrapolated to the position of the arc of maser emission , gives velocities of 115  120 km s@xmath12 , significantly higher than the oh maser velocities of 93  101 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the differing direction and magnitude of the h53@xmath0 and the oh velocity gradients suggests that dynamics of the ionized and molecular gas trace different phenomena .",
    "the orientation of the h@xmath24o masers ( se - nw ) in g28.20 n is consistent with the outflow suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the velocity structure of the masers is ambiguous and does not provide strong evidence for the outflow .    in g45.07",
    "ne , the h@xmath24o maser spots are aligned spatially and kinematically with the outflow axis detected in co(6 - 5 ) and cs(2 - 1 ) molecular lines ( @xcite ; see section  [ g45_indiv ] ) , suggesting that the masers form in warm and dense shocked gas at the inner edges of the outflow lobes @xcite .",
    "we find that all the radio components have point source counterparts in the glimpse archive except g34.26 a and b , and g45.07 sw .",
    "a faint mid - ir source was detected at the position of g45.07 sw ; however , it was not included in the glimpse catalog due to the close proximity of a much brighter source ( g45.07 ne ) that prevented an accurate photometric measurement .",
    "g34.26 a does not have a clear counterpart in the irac image ; this source was detected in the mid - ir by earlier studies , unlike component b which is undetected in the mid - ir .    in table",
    "[ glimpse ] , we list glimpse counterparts to the radio sources ( the closest neighbors ) .",
    "the distance between the mid - ir and radio positions ranges from 0@xmath32 for g45.07 ne to 2@xmath34 for g28.20 s ( see table  [ glimpse ] ) .",
    "the proximity of the mid - ir sources to the radio peaks of hc hii regions suggests that these sources probably are the ionizing ( proto)stars .",
    "the relatively low density of stars nearby to g10.96 e and g28.20 relative to more distant parts of these fields , suggests extinction of background stars in these regions .",
    "the majority of ir sources shown in figures  [ g10irac]-[g45irac ] are probably background stars ; however , we expect to find a number of young stellar objects ( ysos ) in these msfrs .",
    "the ysos can be identified by their mid - ir colors and by fitting their spectral energy distributions with yso models .",
    "this would be particularly interesting for g28.20 , which is located in an irdc ( see figure  [ g28irac ] ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _ images of the sources from our sample suggest that generally the large - scale spatial distribution of gas and dust in these regions are similar ; g34.26 c being the principal exception in our sample .",
    "higher resolution infrared observations would be worthwhile , however , to separate diffuse emission from the mid - ir emission from outflows and disks ( e.g. , ngc7538 irs 1 ; de buizer & minier 2005 ) .",
    "we present high spatial resolution ( 0@xmath39 to 2@xmath33 ) , multi - transition ( h53@xmath0  to h92@xmath0 ) very large array observations of four massive star formation regions hosting hc hii region candidates identified in earlier studies .",
    "g10.96 , g28.20 , and g34.26 contain hc hii region candidates with broad h92@xmath0 ( g10.96 w , g28.20 n ) or h76@xmath0 ( g34.26 b ) lines @xcite .",
    "an additional hc hii region candidate ( g45.07 ne ) , known to have broad h66@xmath0 and h76@xmath0 lines , small size , high electron density and emission measure , was also included in this survey .",
    "we observed up to two additional transitions per source to investigate the change of line width with frequency .",
    "we found a strong correlation of line width with principal quantum number , i.e. , higher frequency lines of sources with broad h92@xmath0  or h76@xmath0  lines have narrower linewidths ( @xmath6140 km s@xmath12 ) indicating that pressure broadening is the main line broadening mechanism at lower frequencies . this result is not surprising because of the high electron density in hc hii regions .",
    "however , large scale dynamics is also an important contributor to line broadening @xcite .",
    "we determined physical properties of the hii regions based on both the continuum and line data .",
    "multi - frequency rrls reported in this paper are well - separated in principal quantum number and will provide good constraints for non - lte models of these regions .    we also present a comparison of the radio continuum and mid - ir emission in hc hii regions from our sample . based on the _ spitzer _ glimpse survey , covering a wavelength range from 3.6 to 8.0 @xmath18 m , we find a generally good correspondence between the radio continuum and dust distributions for the sources in our sample .",
    "the mid - ir images , however , show more complex features and reveal multiple sources that do not correspond so well to the radio continuum .",
    "we report the distribution of h@xmath24o , oh , and ch@xmath23oh masers with respect to the radio continuum .",
    "we also present high - resolution vla archival data for the water masers in g28.20 n for the first time .",
    "we compile information from the literature on maser emission in g10.96 , g28.20 , and g45.07 . a detailed discussion of the maser distribution in g34.26 can be found elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as expected , all of the massive star formation regions studied in this paper are associated with maser emission ; however , the masers are not coincident with all the radio components in these regions . in g10.96 ,",
    "g28.20 , and g45.07 the masers are associated only with the hc hii regions ( g10.96 w , g28.20 n , g45.07 ne ) . in g34.26",
    "the masers are coincident with both the hc hii region g34.26 b and also with the cometary uc hii region g34.26",
    "c. all of the sources associated with masers have broad rrls .",
    "the question of the origin of brrls is not fully answered , although our observations show that pressure broadening is an important mechanism . to distinguish the effects of pressure broadening from large scale motions of the gas and at the same time resolve the structures of hc hii regions will require high - resolution observations of millimeter rrls such as h42@xmath0  and h30@xmath0  . with its high spatial resolution and sensitivity",
