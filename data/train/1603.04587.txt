    "the result of such averaging of the value @xmath186 can be estimated as follows : @xmath187 here we make use of spatial homogeneity of the system on the scales much greater that @xmath109 and an approximately oscillating character of the dependence @xmath111 with the characteristic period of the order of @xmath188 .",
    "as @xmath189 , the component of the averaged electric field along the sample @xmath190 is equal to the electric field from the applied voltage and the averaged velocity @xmath184 has only the component @xmath191 along the sample direction .",
    "the @xmath28 component of the navier - stokes equation ( 9 ) takes the form : @xmath192 which immediately leads to the magnetoresistance ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "let us remind here that eq .",
    "( 13 ) is just the result of mathematical interpolation of the exact formula ( 5 ) , obtained for the conventional poiseuille flow in the flat sample .",
    "so eq .  ( 13 ) is _ more general _ than the assumptions about the geometry of the flow used for its derivation .    in formation of a viscous flow in a sample with the large - radius defects ,",
    "the character of electron scattering ( diffusive or specular ) on the sample edges and the defect edges is not essential .",
    "the nature of momentum relaxation in such the system is following . in vicinities of the defects",
    "the hydrodynamic velocity can not has a component perpendicular to the defect surface .",
    "a slowdown of the flow occurs due to the viscous transfer of the @xmath28 component of the momentum in the @xmath35 direction between the regions which are immediately _ in front of _ the defects ( in the @xmath28 direction ) and the regions _ between _ the defects .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( [ v_bar ] ) , we conclude that the time @xmath193 can be interpreted as the _ non - local _ momentum relaxation time due to the viscosity effect . in other words , the time @xmath97 describes the momentum relaxation in the systems which are characterized by the two features : ( i ) spatial inhomogeneity of the electron momentum relaxation rate [ related to bypassing the large - radius defects or to diffusive scattering on the rough sample edges ] ; ( ii ) viscous transfer of the mean electron momentum due to inhomogeneity of the velocity field @xmath111 .",
    "besides that , typical gaas 2d samples often have a complicated geometry of their edges ( for example , see the sample image in ref .",
    "irregularities of the sample edges may lead to a slowdown of a viscous flow by the way similar as it was described above for the viscous flow in a sample with the large - radius defects .",
    "we believe that the relative contributions from the processes of diffusive scattering on the sample edges and from bypassing the large - radius defects in formation of a viscous flow significantly vary from sample to sample , resulting in a variety of observing features of the giant negative magnetoresistance effect ( see refs ."

    "<S> . the only way to obtain the measured magnitudes of resistivity within our theory is to replace the sample width @xmath4 by some _ effective _ width @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> the sample contains inhomogeneities which result in formation of the conducting channels in the sample with the widths smaller the sample width @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the samples where the giant negative magnetoresistance effect was observed there often exist large - radius oval defects arising in the process of growth of the heterostructures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distance @xmath109 between the defects varies in the range 20 - 100@xmath110 m , while their radii are of the order of 20@xmath110 m @xcite .    in vicinities of the defects </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic velocity @xmath111 can not has a component in the direction perpendicular to the defect edge . </S>",
    "<S> a slowdown of the flow occurs due to the viscous transfer of the @xmath28 component of the electron momentum in the @xmath35 direction from the regions _ between _ the defects to the regions which are immediately _ in front of _ the defects ( in the @xmath28 direction ) . </S>",
    "<S> so the large - radius defects lead to momentum relaxation by the mechanism , analogous to the diffusive scattering on rough sample boundaries , as well as to formation of the conducting channels with the widths smaller than @xmath4 . at the scales of the order of @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> the picture of fluid motion is rather similar to the poiseuille flow in a rectangular sample with the width @xmath112 . </S>",
