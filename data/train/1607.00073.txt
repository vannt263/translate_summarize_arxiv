    "a very large number of configurations have been investigated for power generation from ac source networks , and extend to wireless power generation @xcite , rectenna arrays@xcite and smart grids@xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the generation of dc power , not only for its ubiquiitous use but also for efficiency in transmission over long distances with asynchronous power generators with a wide range of sources for energy harvesting .",
    "a classic configuration consists of a rectenna@xcite in which diode arrays are used to rectify the output of a receiving antenna , followed by filters to provided the desired dc power .",
    "such nonlinear networks have become very interesting recently in models in which diode elements are integrated into plasmonic structures , in the rapidly emerging new field of nonlinear metamaterials@xcite , among others .",
    "the ability to design and engineer local phase shifts within each element of a receiving array represents a new capability that has not been studied at all , and possible configurations remain underexplored .",
    "lattice networks consisting of nonlinear elements like diodes have been extensively studied in statistical physics , in directed networks and percolation problems@xcite , and random circuit element networks@xcite .",
    "the range of phenomena is potentially vast even for deterministic systems . up to now",
    ", the inclusion of voltage sources within the lattice sites has not been considered .",
    "it may be expected that integration of sources with random or varying phases at each lattice site will lead to an even richer range of phenomena .",
    "distributed generation of power from both conventional and alternative energy sources provides motivation to study networks in which voltage sources are also distributed throughout the lattice .    in this article",
    ", we investigate rectification phenomena in a particular 2-d lattice network consisting of @xmath2 sites in which each lattice site consists of an ac source in a bridge - rectifier like configuration .",
    "each lattice site shares one diode with each of its nearest neighbors , as shown in figure  [ fig : wampum ] .",
    "the configuration is inspired by rectenna arrays , but now with the addition of ac sources at each lattice site .",
    "the system consists of @xmath2 ac sources , and @xmath3 diodes .",
    "it can be seen that when @xmath4 , the configuration is identical to a classic bridge rectifier combination .",
    "the current through the load resistor has many frequency components , with the zero frequency dc component being the most important for rectification .",
    "our results show that an exact analytical result valid for arbitrarily large @xmath1 can be derived even for such a strongly nonlinear system with idealized diodes .",

    "the current load in each diode can be reduced by adopting a parallel configuration ( see the left side of figure  [ fig : wampum ] ) . for @xmath21 bridge rectifiers arranged in a parallel configuration ,",
    "the sources have to be in phase .",
    "the fraction of the ripple in the output voltage can be seen to be just as large it would for a single rectifier , and additional filtering would be needed to get dc current through the load resistor .",
    "these elementary statements motivate us to investigate a hybrid system that combines series and parallel combinations into the 2d lattice shown in figure  [ fig : wampum ] , with each unit cell is mapped onto a conventional bridge rectifier .",
    "remarkably , we find that for a special choice of phases of the ac sources , the configuration provides the advantage of reduced ripple in the rectified dc voltage of a series combination , with the advantage of reduction in peak current that is the hallmark of the parallel combination .",
