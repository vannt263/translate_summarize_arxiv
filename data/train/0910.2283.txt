    "in the past three years , great attention has been paid to the invisibility cloaks due to their fascinating and exciting properties [ 1 - 23 ] . the interesting idea to control the electromagnetic ( em ) waves was proposed in refs . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] .",
    "the first free - space cloak was experimentally demonstrated at the microwave frequency using the reduced constitutive parameters [ 3 ] .",
    "later , li and pendry have proposed a kind of ground - plane cloak recently [ 4 ] , which was verified soon in the microwave regime [ 5 ] and in the optical regime [ 6,7 ] .",
    "many further analytical and numerical investigations have also been devoted in the recently years [ 8 - 23 ] .    to design a free - space cloak ,",
    "one usually transforms an enclosed space to an annular space with the outer boundary unchanged [ 1 ] . as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the region enclosed by boundary @xmath0 is compressed to the annular region bounded by the outer boundary @xmath0 and an inner boundary @xmath1 .",
    "such a space mapping can be expressed as a specific coordinate transformation .",
    "generally , the inner boundary @xmath1 is obtained by blowing up a line or a point as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) [ 23 ] .",
    "thus the invisibility cloaks can be divided into two classes : point - transformed cloaks and line - transformed cloaks .",
    "the green region in fig .",
    "1(c ) is the desired cloaking layer .",
    "one problem for the point - transformed full - parameter cloaks is that the parameters always exist singularities on the inner boundary . in other words , some parameter components approaches infinity near the inner boundary , which is difficult to reach even using modern metamaterials [ 3 ] .",
    "recently , the circular cloaks [ 14,16 ] , elliptical cloaks [ 17 - 20 ] , and other - shaped cloaks [ 13,21,23 ] have been designed and studied in different coordinate systems .",
    "however , the material parameters for the above cloaks still have infinite values on the inner boundary .",
    "mathematically , such cloaks try to crush an shielded region to a point , which leads to the singularity of constitutive parameters .    in view of the difficulty to realize the point - transformed full - parameter cloak ,",
    "a ground - plane cloak which can hide the object under a metamaterial carpet has been proposed [ 4 ] .",
    "unlike the completely free - space cloaks , the ground - plane cloak crushes the hidden object to a conducting wire .",
    "suck a carpet - like cloak does not require extreme values of the material parameters .",
    "but the carpet - like cloak can only shield object under a conducting surface , and can not shield objects in free space .    in this work",
    ", we propose a class of free - space line - transformed cylindrical cloaks which have easily - realizable constitutive parameters .",
    "instead of shrinking the concealed object to a point as usual , such cloaks crush the object to a line segment .",
    "the scattering properties of such cloaks have been investigated numerically for both transverse - electric ( te ) and transverse - magnetic ( tm ) incidences of plane waves .",
    "a line - transformed invisibility cloak with a perfectly electric conducting ( pec ) inner boundary is indeed a reshaper of a pec line to which the cloaked object is crushed .",
    "numerical results of near - field distributions and scattering patterns have verified the above conclusions .",
    "we also investigate the relationship between the constitutive parameters of a line - transformed cloak and the length of the corresponding line .",
    "the changing range of constitutive parameters is large when the line is short , while the changing range becomes small when the line is long .",
    "the proposed invisibility cloaks could be realized using artificial metamaterials .",
    "using the unique feature of classical elliptically - cylindrical coordinate system , we construct a class of line - transformed cloaks . the relationship between this coordinate system @xmath2 and the cartesian",
    "coordinates @xmath3 is written as @xmath4 in which @xmath5 is the half focus of the ellipse .",
    "we note that in this coordinate system , if @xmath5 is assumed to be constant , then isolines for @xmath6 can be a series of elliptical cylindrical shells with the same focus value .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 means a line segment @xmath8 with length @xmath9 . to construct a line - transformed cloak , a general spatial transformation from the elliptical region @xmath10 $ ] to the annular region @xmath11 $ ]",
    "can be expressed as follows @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is a continuous and differentiable function with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are coordinates of the inner and outer boundaries of the cloak .",
    "the relationship between coordinates and lengths of major axes can be expressed as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the lengths of major axes for inner and outer shells of the cloak .",
    "obviously , the inner boundary is crushed to the line segment @xmath9 using the above coordinate transformation .",
    "the constitutive tensors of the cloak in an arbitrary coordinate system are given as the following equations @xmath22 here , the jacobian matrix is @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is the derivative of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath25 . the invisibility cloak is considered to be placed in the free space , in other words , @xmath26 . then the relative permittivity and permeability tensors of the line - transformed cloak are expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the inverse function of @xmath13 .",
    "the cloak is considered to be lossless in the working frequency . for the sake of simplicity and real applications ,",
    "we choose @xmath13 as a linear function @xmath29 in the following discussions . as a result ,",
    "we obtain @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    equations ( 4)-(6 ) provide full - design material parameters for a general line - transformed cloak in the classical elliptical - cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the relationship between the permittivity and permeability components and the length of the line segment @xmath9 has been shown in figure 2 , in which we choose the lengths of major axes as @xmath32 m and @xmath33 m. to visualize the changing ranges of material parameters in cloaking layer better , we plot the parameter components along the line @xmath34 .",
    "when the half focus @xmath5 changes from 0 to @xmath20 , the @xmath6 and @xmath35 components of the material parameters are shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , and the @xmath36 component ranges from 0 to @xmath35 as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , which can be easily observed from eq . ( 6 ) .",
    "clearly , this set of material parameters have no singularities because the line - transformed cloak crushes the concealed object to a line segment with nonzero length @xmath9 .    for practical reasons ,",
    "we choose two cases @xmath37 m and @xmath38 m to study the material properties of line - transformed cloaks .",
    "the parameter components have been illustrated in fig .",
    "when selecting @xmath37 m , then we have @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the @xmath36 components range from 0 to 4 .",
    "when @xmath41 , then @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and the @xmath36 components range from 0 to 2 . in these two cases , the material properties in the cloaking region are much easier to achieve using metamaterial structures .",
    "we will investigate the cloaking performance of the line - transformed cloaks for such two cases in the next section .",
    "to illustrate the invisible properties of the line - transformed cloaks , we report the results of some accurately numerical simulations .",
    "all simulations are performed by using the software package , comsol multiphysics , which is based on the finite element method ( fem ) . here , both te - polarized and tm - polarized time - harmonic incident plane waves will be considered . for the te - wave incidence , only @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath45 , and @xmath46 components of the material parameters are required for the simulations ; for the tm - wave incidence , only @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are of interest .",
    "the working frequency is chosen as 3 ghz , at which the required material properties are easily realized by artificial metamaterials . as mentioned above , in all simulations ,",
    "the lengths of major axes for inner and outer elliptical shells of the cloak are set as 0.2 m and 0.4 m , respectively , and the two ellipses have the common focus .",
    "first , we consider the case when the line segment is chosen as @xmath50 m and te - polarized plane waves are horizontally incident from the left to the right .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the total electric - field distribution of the line - transformed cloak , which contains a pec inner boundary . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the electric - field distribution of a pec line is shown , in which the dashed line indicates the outer boundary of the cloaking layer used in the design of the line - transformed cloak .",
    "we draw this boundary only for the sake of visualization . by comparison of figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , we observe that the scattering pattern of the line - transformed cloak with pec inner boundary is exactly the same as that of a pec line . to illustrate this better",
    ", we calculate the scattering widthes for the bare pec cylinder , the line - transformed cloak , and the corresponding pec line , as plotted in fig .",
    "the scattering widthes and field distributions reveal that the line - transformed cloak with pec inner boundary is perceived as a pec line when observed anywhere outside the boundary of the cloaking layer .",
    "when tm - polarized waves are incident along the horizontal direction , the total magnetic - field distribution of the line - transformed cloak with the pec inner boundary is illustrated in fig .",
    "in such a case , the magnetic - field distribution behave exactly the same as that of a pec line shown in fig .",
    "evidently , a much smaller scattering outside the cloaking region is observed in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) .",
    "the far - field scattering patterns for the cloak and pec line are exactly the same , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "hence , a line - transformed cloak with pec inner boundary is reshaped as a pec line scatterer .",
    "next we consider the case when the pec line is chosen as @xmath51 m. figure 5 illustrates the numerical results of electric fields in the computational domain under the incidence of te - polarized plane waves .",
    "when the waves are incident along the horizontal direction , the electric - field distributions of the line - transformed cloak with the pec inner boundary and the pec line are shown in figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , from which we clearly see that the field values are exactly the same .",
    "the comparison of scattering widthes is shown in fig .",
    "when the tm - polarized plane waves are incident , the magnetic - field distributions behave significantly different from those in fig .",
    "5 , as demonstrated in fig . 6 . clearly ,",
    "the near - filed and far - field distributions are exactly identical for the cloak and the pec line , as shown in figs .",
    "6(a ) , 6(b ) and 6(c ) .",
    "the above simulation results verify that a line - transformed cloak with a pec inner boundary scatters the waves exactly like a certain pec line for both te - wave and tm - wave incidences .",
    "in other words , the line - transformed cloak with the pec inner boundary is indeed a reshaper of the pec line .",
    "hence , for the line - transformed cloak with the pec inner boundary , the significant difference between te - wave and tm - wave incidences is similar to the case for a pec line . from above simulation results",
    ", we also observe that the line - transformed cloak have strong scattering for the te - wave incidence ( see figs .",
    "3(b ) and 5(b ) ) , but have weak scattering for the tm - wave incidence ( see figs .",
    "4(b ) and 6(b ) ) .",
    "such a effect can be explained from the viewpoint of the cloaking shell which shrinks the pec inner boundary to the pec line .",
    "it is well - known that a pec line forces the tangential electric field to zero , which can be observed in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 5(a ) for the te incidence .",
    "however , the pec line can support a discontinuity of the tangential magnetic field and the scattering decreases significantly for the tm incidence , as shown in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 6(a ) .",
    "hence , for the tm incident case , the cloaking performance is significantly better .",
    "in summary , we have studied the scattering properties of a class of line - transformed cloaks numerically for both te and tm incidences of plane waves .",
    "such a cloak with the pec inner boundary is indeed a reshaping of a pec line to which the shielded object is crushed .",
    "the numerical results of near - field distributions and far - field scattering patterns have confirmed the above conclusions .",
    "we have also investigated the relationship between the material parameters of the line - transformed cloak and the length of the corresponding line , which provides an efficient way to realize the invisibility cloaks using artificial metamaterials .",
