    "the discovery of very bright quasars , with luminosities @xmath1 , at redshift @xmath2 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) suggests that some smbhs as massive as a few@xmath3 already existed when the universe was less than 1 gyr old ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the presence of these smbhs presents a puzzle . metal ",
    "free stars , with masses @xmath4 , are expected to form at redshifts as high as @xmath5 @xcite , and leave behind remnant bhs with similar masses @xcite . however , the natural time - scale , i.e. the eddington time , for growing these seed bhs by @xmath6 orders of magnitude in mass is comparable to the age of the universe ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this makes it difficult to reach @xmath7 without a phase of rapid ( at least modestly super  eddington ) accretion , unless a list of optimistic assumptions are made in hierarchical merger models , in which multiple seed bhs are allowed to grow without interruption , and to combine into a single smbh @xcite .",
    "an alternative class of explanations involves yet more rapid gas accretion or collapse @xcite . in this family of models , primordial gas collapses rapidly into a smbh as massive as @xmath8 , either directly , or possibly by accreting onto a pre  existing smaller seed bh @xcite , or going through the intermediate state of a very massive star @xcite , a dense stellar cluster @xcite , or a `` quasistar '' @xcite .",
    "these so  called `` direct collapse '' models involve metal  free gas in relatively massive ( @xmath9 ) dark matter halos at redshift @xmath10 , with virial temperatures @xmath11k .",
    "the gas that cools and collapses in these halos must avoid fragmentation , shed angular momentum efficiently , and collapse rapidly .",
    "several authors have worked out the growth of smbhs from stellar ",
    "mass seeds , by following the build - up of dark matter ( dm ) halos , and using simple prescriptions to track the formation of seed bhs , their subsequent growth by accretion , and their mergers .",
    "this can be done either semi  analytically @xcite , using monte - carlo realizations of the dm merger trees @xcite , or based on cosmological hydrodynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties about the statistics of the dm halo merger trees are essentially negligible , since dm halo formation has been directly resolved in numerical simulations at the relevant low masses ( down to @xmath12 ) and high redshifts ( out to @xmath13 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the merger trees is limited mainly by the @xmath14 uncertainty in the normalization of the primordial power spectrum , @xmath15 , and by the need to extrapolate the primordial power spectrum 2 - 3 orders of magnitude below the spatial scales on which it has been directly constrained .",
    "smbhs  @xcite . ]",
    "the most important  and still rather uncertain ",
    "ingredients of this stellar seed scenario can be summarized as follows .",
    "what is the threshold mass ( or virial temperature , @xmath16 ) for early dm halos in which pop iii stars can form ?",
    "a reasonable guess is @xmath17 few @xmath18 100 k , which allows molecular @xmath19cooling @xcite .",
    "( ii ) in what fraction ( @xmath20 ) of these halos do seed bhs form ?",
    "this is a more difficult question , since various feedback processes ( due to radiation , metal pollution , or mechanical energy deposition ) could suppress pop iii star formation in the vast majority of early low  mass halos .",
    "the answer also depends on the imf of pop iii stars , since whether the stars leave a bh remnant or explode as pair - instability sne depends on their masses .",
    "( iii ) what is the time  averaged accretion rate of the seed bhs ?",
    "this is conveniently parameterized by a duty cycle @xmath21 , defined as the fraction of the mass accretion rate that would produce the eddington luminosity , if @xmath22 of the rest mass was converted to radiation ( so that @xmath23 is the fiducial eddington rate ) .",
    "the expectation is that @xmath24 is less than unity due to radiative feedback ( but in practice , if the accretion is radiatively inefficient , or if the radiation is trapped or is beamed and `` leaks out '' , then @xmath24 could exceed unity ) .",
    "( iv ) finally , what happens when dm halos merge ?",
    "the simplest and most optimistic assumption is that the bhs to promptly coalesce , as well .",
    "however , even if dynamical friction on the dm is efficient , it is possible that , due to the radiation of its parent star , the remnant bhs are no longer embedded in dense enough gas to allow this .",
    "furthermore , even if the bhs coalesce , the merged binary bh can be ejected from the shallow potential wells ( @xmath25km / s ) of the early halos by the gravitational `` kick '' , and effectively lost .",
    "this depends on the recoil speed , which depends strongly on the mass ratio and on the spin vectors of the two bhs .    .",
    "the 24 different models shown in the figure assume different parameter combinations as follows .",
    "the columns , from left to right , adopt @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the top row assumes a random binary spin orientation , and the bottom row assumes that bh spins are aligned with the binary s orbital angular momentum . in each panel ,",
    "the time  averaged mass  accretion rates , in eddington units , are assumed to be either @xmath23 ( black solid curves ) , @xmath30 ( blue dotted ) , and @xmath31 ( green dash - dotted ) .",
    "the numbers in the upper - right corners represent the total mass density in smbhs @xmath32 $ ] for each model .",
    "the red dashed line demarcates the abundance of @xmath33 smbhs with @xmath34 already observed in the sdss . ]    in figure  [ fig : smbhmassfunction ] , we show smbh mass functions at @xmath0 , illustrating the impact of the above assumptions , taken from a recent example of the monte carlo merger tree approach @xcite .",
    "the mass functions were constructed from the merger histories of @xmath35 dm halos with masses @xmath36 at redshift @xmath0 . a robust conclusion for a model to produce",
    "enough @xmath0 smbhs is that @xmath37  namely the @xmath38 stellar seed bhs must accrete near the eddington rate nearly all the time .",
    "the initial bh occupation fraction also has to be @xmath39 .",
    "finally , if the initial seeds are rare ( @xmath40 ) , then gravitational kicks do _ not _ have a big impact , and it makes little difference to the smbh mass function whether spins are aligned or randomly oriented .",
    "this is because in this case , the few `` lucky '' seeds that form earliest already have a chance to grow by @xmath41 two orders of magnitude in mass before encountering their first merger .",
    "the masses of the two bhs at the merger are then very unequal ( @xmath42 ) , making kick velocities too low ( @xmath43km / s ; irrespective of the spins ) to lead to ejection .",
    "an important additional issue is that in those models that satisfy the sdss constraint on the smbh abundance ( upper right corners in figure  [ fig : smbhmassfunction ] , marked in red ) , the massive end of the smbh mass function is extremely steep .",
    "this prediction is not surprising , as the most massive smbhs reside in few @xmath44 halos , which probe the @xmath45 tail of the halo mass function at @xmath0 ( and there are indeed @xmath46 times as many few@xmath47 halos , which host @xmath48 bhs ) .",
    "it does mean , however , that the total mass density in smbhs with masses above @xmath49 bhs ( shown by the numbers in the upper right corners in figure  [ fig : smbhmassfunction ] ) are overpredicted by a factor of @xmath50 .",
    "the mass density of such smbhs at @xmath51 is inferred to be several@xmath52 , and the expectation is that most ( @xmath53 ) of this mass was accreted well after @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "some strong feedback is therefore needed to eliminate this significant overprediction .",
    "possible candidates for this are radiative feedback internal to halos , which maintains the `` @xmath54 relation '' in ultra ",
    "high redshift , low mass halos , or the termination of pop iii star formation , at redshifts as high as @xmath55 , due to lyman werner radiation or metal pollution .    finally , it is worth emphasizing that the mass accretion rate corresponding to the eddington limit  for the fiducial radiative efficiency of @xmath56 for converting mass to radiation  would need to be exceeded only by a factor of a @xmath57 few to make the growth from stellar seeds much easier .",
    "radiative feedback is usually expected to lead to sub ",
    "eddington rates ( e.g. @xcite ) , and in spherical symmetry , the accretion was recently to shown to be episodic , with @xmath58 @xcite . however , modestly exceeding the eddington rate is certainly plausible in theory : density inhomogeneities can allow radiation to leak out of low density regions while most of the accreting matter can be contained in high density regions .",
    "for example , magnetized radiation dominated accretion disks are subject to a `` photon bubble '' instability that nonlinearly appears to lead to strong density inhomogeneities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , observations have so far not revealed systems that sustain super ",
    "eddington accretion for extended periods ; it would then still have to be explained why the @xmath59 quasar bhs have this unique behaviour .     and",
    "@xmath60 , in the usual units of @xmath61 ( solid and dashed curves ; see the legend in the panel ) .",
    "each blue dotted line corresponds to a different constant jeans mass .",
    "the gas is heated adiabatically until a density of @xmath62 , at which @xmath63cooling becomes efficient and cools the gas to a few @xmath64 k. however , there exists a critical flux , with a value between @xmath65 and @xmath66 , above which @xmath67cooling is disabled ( adapted from ref.@xcite ) . ]",
    "an appealing alternative idea is to produce , say , a @xmath68 smbh `` directly ''  i.e. much faster than this would take under eddington  limited accretion from a stellar seed .",
    "this would clearly be helpful to explain the high  redshift smbhs , and many authors ( listed in the introduction ) proposed this may be possible using metal  free gas in relatively massive ( @xmath9 ) dark matter halos at redshift @xmath10 , with virial temperatures @xmath11k .",
    "the gas that cools and collapses in these halos must avoid fragmentation , shed angular momentum efficiently , and collapse rapidly .",
    "these conditions are unlikely to be met , unless the gas remains `` warm '' , i.e. at temperatures @xmath69k . in recent numerical simulations ,",
    "shang et al .",
    "@xcite found that the gas in such halos , when collapsing in isolation , forms @xmath63 efficiently , and cools to temperatures of @xmath70 k. although no fragmentation was seen , the gas is expected to ultimately fragment on smaller scales that have not yet been resolved @xcite .",
    "more importantly , even if fragmentation was avoided , the cold gas was found to flow inward at low velocities , near the sound speed of @xmath71 , with a correspondingly low accretion rate of @xmath72 .",
    "this results in conditions nearly identical to those in the cores of lower - mass minihalos ; extensive ultra  high resolution simulations had concluded that the gas then forms a single @xmath73 star @xcite or perhaps a massive binary @xcite , rather than a supermassive star or bh .",
    "there have been at least three different ideas on how to avoid @xmath19cooling and keep the gas warm .",
    "one is for the gas to `` linger '' for a sufficiently long time at @xmath74k that it collapses to a smbh , even before @xmath63 has a chance to reduce the temperature . for a sufficiently high space and column  density of neutral hydrogen",
    ", the absorption of trapped lyman @xmath75 photons can be followed by collisional de  excitation , rather than the resonant scattering of the lyman @xmath75 photon , effectively trapping much of the cooling radiation .",
    "this could lead to such lingering and to smbh formation ",
    "analogous to opacity  limited fragmentation in colder gas in the context of star formation @xcite .    alternatively ,",
    "@xmath63cooling may be disabled if the gas is exposed to an intense uv flux @xmath76 , either directly photo  dissociating @xmath63 ( in the lyman ",
    "werner bands near a photon energy of @xmath77 ev ) or photo  dissociating the intermediary @xmath78 ( at photon energies @xmath79 ev ) . requiring the photo - dissociation timescale , @xmath80 , to be shorter than the @xmath19formation timescale , @xmath81 ,",
    "generically yields a critical flux that increases linearly with density , @xmath82 .",
    "since the gas in halos with @xmath83k can cool via atomic lyman @xmath75 radiation and lose pressure support , it inevitably collapses further . as a result ,",
    "in these halos , the critical flux is high , @xmath84 , depending on the assumed spectral shape ( ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also refs .",
    "@xcite who found similar , but somewhat higher values ) .",
    "the existence of this critical flux is illustrated in figure  [ fig : jcritonezone ] , using a one - zone model in which the density evolution is approximated by spherical collapse .",
    "figure  [ fig : jcritsim ] shows the radial structure of a @xmath85 halo , at the time of its collapse , when illuminated at various intensities , taken from three  dimensional simulations with the amr code enzo .",
    "these profiles clearly show that when the uv flux exceeds a critical value , the core of the halo is prevented from cooling to low temperatures .    , collapsing at redshift @xmath86 , exposed to various uv background fluxes .",
    "the four panels show snapshots of the spherically averaged profile of the particle number density , gas temperature , @xmath87 fraction and @xmath63 fraction at the time of the collapse of the core for several different values of the uv background intensity @xmath88 , as labeled .",
    "the existence of a critical flux , here with a value between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , above which @xmath63cooling is disabled , is evident ( adapted from ref.@xcite ) . ]     as a function of the enclosed gas mass @xmath91 , in the same halo depicted in figure  [ fig : jcritsim ] , illuminated with different intensities , as labeled . in the halos exposed to a supercritical flux ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the mass accretion rate , @xmath92 , is nearly @xmath66 times higher than in halos whose gas cools via @xmath63 ( @xmath93 ) . at the center of the brightly illuminated halos , @xmath94 of gas accumulates within a kelvin - helmholtz time of",
    "@xmath95 yr , possibly leading to the formation of a smbh with a comparable mass ( adapted from ref.@xcite ) . ]",
    "the 3d simulations also provide an estimate of the mass of the central `` object '' ( star or smbh ) that ultimately forms at the core of the halo , based on the measured profile of the mass accretion rate .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : macc ] .",
    "in particular , when the flux exceeds the critical value , and the gas remains warm , the collapse is significantly delayed .",
    "however , when the gas ultimately does collapse , it accretes toward the center at the sound speed ( @xmath96km / s ) , leading to a mass accretion rate of @xmath97 .",
    "this is much higher than in the case of cold ( @xmath98 km / s ) gas in halos with efficient @xmath63 cooling ( the simulations reveal @xmath99 , as expected in self  gravitating gas ) .",
    "importantly , the critical flux is high  likely significantly exceeding the expected level of the cosmic uv background at high redshifts .",
    "therefore , only a small subset of all @xmath83k halos , which have unusually close and bright neighbors , may see a sufficiently high flux .",
    "however , given the strong clustering of early halos , there is a sufficient number of these close halo pairs to account for the abundance of the @xmath0 quasars @xcite .",
    "a more significant challenge to this idea is that in order to avoid fragmentation , the gas in these halos must also remain essentially free of any metals and dust @xcite .",
    "this requirement could be difficult to reconcile with the presence of a nearby , luminous galaxies .",
    "since both of the `` standard '' scenarios discussed above require some optimistic assumptions , it is interesting to consider some more exotic possibilities .",
    "it is commonly believed that the magnetic fields permeating galaxies such as the milky way arose by the amplification of a much weaker large  scale seed field .",
    "weak primordial magnetic fields , with strengths of up to @xmath57 1ng , can be produced in phase transitions in the early universe , during inflation , or during the electroweak or qcd phase transitions .",
    "it has recently been shown that such a primordial magnetic field could produce a variant of the `` direct collapse '' scenario @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the field is tangled , then ambipolar diffusion will provide an efficient new mechanism to heat the gas as it collapses in protogalactic halos .",
    "if the field has a strength above @xmath100 ( comoving ) ng , the collapsing gas is kept warm ( @xmath101 k ) until it reaches the critical density @xmath102 at which the roto  vibrational states of @xmath63 approach local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "@xmath19cooling then remains inefficient , and the gas temperature stays near @xmath103k , even as it continues to collapse to higher densities .",
    "the critical magnetic field strength required to permanently suppress @xmath63cooling is somewhat higher than upper limit of @xmath104ng from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "however , it can be realized in the rare @xmath105 regions of the spatially fluctuating @xmath106field ; these regions contain a sufficient number of halos to account for the @xmath59 quasar bhs .",
    "these are @xmath57100 times more massive than the dm halos in the `` usual '' direct collapse models . ]",
    "another `` exotic '' idea is that the first pop iii stars may be powered by heating by dark matter annihilation , rather than by nuclear fusion @xcite .",
    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) can be such a heat source , as long as they reach sufficiently high density inside the first stars , and if the annihilation products are trapped inside the star .",
    "several authors have studied the impact of this additional heating mechanism on the structure and evolution of such `` dark stars '' @xcite .",
    "in particular , these stars can live much longer than `` normal '' pop iii stars , and because their radiation is soft , they can continue to accrete gas , as long as the dark matter heating persists , and grow to masses of up to @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "these stars are bright , and should be detectable directly by _ jwst _ @xcite .",
    "( corresponding to the mean density at redshift @xmath108 ) and ending at the turnaround just below @xmath109 .",
    "the right panel follows the subsequent temperature evolution in the collapsing phase .",
    "the figure shows the existence of a critical magnetic field , with a value between @xmath110 and @xmath111 ng , above which @xmath67cooling is disabled , and the gas temperature always remains near @xmath74k ( adapted from ref.@xcite ) . ]",
    "in order to distinguish between the various proposed models discussed above , observations must be able to detect smbhs with masses below @xmath112 beyond redshift @xmath113 .",
    "this requirement is satisfied by _ jwst _ ( with a sensitivity of @xmath114 njy at near - ir wavelengths ) and also in the radio by evla and , ultimately , the proposed instrument ska ( with sensitivities of 1 - 10 @xmath115jy at 1 - 10 ghz ) .",
    "these ir and radio data should also be able to provide at least a crude measure of their masses , but obtaining redshifts will be challenging .",
    "the assembly of the earliest smbhs will ultimately be best probed by the _",
    "lisa _ satellite , which could detect @xmath116 black holes beyond redshift @xmath117 , with a signal  to  noise ratio of s / n > 30 or better @xcite .",
    "this should allow at least a crude determination of the masses and distances to these low  mass smbhs , and to directly distinguish between the various proposed scenarios .",
    "i thank the organizers for their kind invitation and for putting together a very stimulating conference .",
    "i would also like to thank my recent collaborators , especially cien shang , taka tanaka , mark dijkstra , and kazuyuki omukai , whose work was especially emphasized here .",
