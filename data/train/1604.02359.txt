    "infinite range connectivity are required while natural qubit interactions are finite range @xcite .",
    "another fundamental question is the possible quantum speedup due to the scaling of the minimal gap @xcite and the sensitivity to errors @xcite .",
    "a proposal with the aim to address several of these challenges is the parity adiabatic quantum optimization scheme @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a fully connected system is encoded in a larger hilbert space with local constraints on a square lattice .",
    "the optimization problem is , in contrast to embedding schemes@xcite , encoded in local fields that act on the qubits and the interactions are 4-body constraints that are independent of the problem .",
    "in this paper we propose an implementation of the parity adiabatic quantum optimization scheme @xcite with pair with transmons .",
    "for this purpose , we present a general recursive decomposition of classical k - local ising terms . unlike previous proposals for the realization of such many - body terms@xcite , in our work , the higher order terms are not the result of a perturbation theory , a time - dependent model or a gadget construction . rather , we focus on only reproducing the ground state which allows one to decompose the constraints to direct pair interactions .",
    "our construction consists of two steps : a recursive decomposition of k - local terms to 3-body terms and a decomposition of each 3-body term into two - body terms .",
    "based on this decomposition , we present a transmon implementation with a 2d setup where all pair interactions have the same sign , are next neighbor and do not cross each other . in the parity scheme , the @xmath7 interactions can be always - on which enables an implementation with coupled josephson ring modulators .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2.1 we briefly review the parity adiabatic quantum computing scheme . in section 2.2",
    "we present the general decomposition of ising - type constraints which we apply in section 2.3 to the 4-body terms of the paqc scheme .",
    "aqc maps the solution to a complicated optimisation problem into the groundstate of a specifically designed hamilton operator @xmath8 @xcite . rather than cooling into the groundstate of a system that is described by @xmath8 , which is two slow ,",
    "one prepares the system at a different point in parameter space described by @xmath9 in its groundstate . afterwards",
    "a adiabatic sweep in parameter - space prepares the system in the groundstate of the problem hamilton operator @xmath8 .",
    "this is only advantageous if there is a known efficient technique to prepare the system in the groundstate of @xmath9 and if the maximal sweep speed scales polynomial with the problem size .",
    "one can think of aqc as the slow deformation of a complex high dimensional energy landscape .",
    "the state of the system is prepared in a trivial valley of the energy landscape and the adiabatic sweep deforms the energy landscape while the system tries to stay in the instantaneous valley . to unlock the true potential of quantum mechanics we have to enable the system to tunnel through energy barriers to the deepest valley .",
    "this is accomplished by choosing initial and final hamilton operators that do not commute @xmath10\\neq 0 $ ]     and @xmath11 of the spin - glass annealing paradigm is encoded in the state of the spin @xmath12 .",

    "the initial point in parameter space could be the point of dominating on - site transverse fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 and the corresponding groundstate would be the fully separable state @xmath21 . the on - site fields and ising interaction strengths are slowly deformed to prepare the spin - glass in the groundstate of @xmath8 given in parameter space by , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath20 .",
    "the actual values of @xmath24 and @xmath17 encode the optimisation problem .",
    "the spin glass remains in its groundstate , if the sweep is slow enough , and a subsequent readout of all spin states provides the solution to the given optimisation problem .",
    "the main obstacle for the construction of a spin - glass annealer is the implementation of tunable all - to - all ising interactions .      in paqc ,",
    "a system with a larger number of spins but only local interactions is used to mimic the spin glass system with all - to - all ising interactions at the end of the adiabatic sweep .",
    "this is possible because there exists a unambiguous mapping of eigenstates of the spin - glass system to the lowest energy states of the paqc system which are separated by a energy gap from the remaining states of the enlarged hlibert space of the paqc system .",
    "the mapping between states of the spin - glass system with all - to - all connectivity to the states of the paqc system is accomplished as follows : the ising interaction @xmath25 has two twofold degenerate eigenvalues : @xmath26 and @xmath2 corresponding to parallel ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and antiparallel ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) alignment of the spins . in the paqc system the state of this ising interaction gets represented by a single spin , say state @xmath31 corresponds to a parallel configuration and @xmath32 to a antiparallel configuration of spins .",
    "this already provides us with an unambiguous mapping from states of the spin - glass with all - to - all connectivity with @xmath33 spins to the states of the paqc system with @xmath3 spins .",
    "however the larger hilbert space of the paqc system already prohibits an unambiguous mapping of all states to corresponding states of the spin - glass hamilton operator .",
    "the effective reduction of the hilbert space of the paqc system is accomplished with constraints .",
    "constraints are terms in the hamilton operator that afflict large energy penalties on configurations of the paqc systems that do not have a counterpart in the spin - glass system .",
    "the paqc system is a spatial arrangement of the spins which enables only local constraint , i.e. energy penalties involving only neighbouring spins ( c.f .",
    "b ) and @xcite ) .",
    "it consists of a cubic lattice of spins with overall pyramid geometry where the constraints act locally on every unit cell of the cubic lattice .",
    "the hamilton operator of paqc has the form @xmath34 here , @xmath35 are the pauli operators spins in the paqc system .",

    "@xmath38 is the schedule function of the constraint term .",
    "@xmath38 can be switched from @xmath40 to @xmath42 , with @xmath42 dominating every other energy scale in the system .",
    "however , paqc also opens the possibility to keep the constraints `` always - on '' .",
    "the constraints are implemented with 4-body ising interactions involving the north- @xmath43 , east- @xmath44 , south- @xmath45 and west- @xmath46 spins of every plaquette @xmath47 .",
    "they are constraints because at least at the end of the adiabatic sweep they are the dominating energy contribution and all dynamics is restricted to reside in their groundstate - manifold .    in this way the technological challenge of implementing tunable all - to - all ising interactions has been changed to implementing local 4-body ising constraints . in the following",
    "we show how to further decompose general many - body ising constraints to two - body ising interactions with the help of ancilla spins .",
    "the constraint decomposition follows a 2-step process : ( i ) we present a general recursive technique to decompose many - body ising constraints to 3-body ising constraints with ancilla spins and use this technique to decompose the 4-body ising constraint of paqc to two 3-body ising constraint , and ( ii ) we show a decomposition of a 3-body ising constraint with 2-body ising interactions with one ancilla spin .",
    "this constraint decomposition technique follows a similar logic to the embedding described above .",
    "however instead of embedding the whole eigensystem of an operator in another , we only need to embed the groundstate - manifold of the constraint and make sure that the groundstate - manifold of the embedding constraint is still separated by a sufficient gap from the rest of the states .",

    "depending on the sign of the constraint strength @xmath50 either the states with even or parity are the groundstate - manifold , i.e. are `` allowed '' under the constraint .",
    "given a set of qubits in eigenstates of their respective @xmath6 operators we could detect the parity of the state by either detecting the parity of the whole set or subdividing the set into two subsets , @xmath51 ( spins @xmath49 through to @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 ( spins @xmath54 through to n ) , and detecting the parity of the two subsets . if the two subsets have the same parity , the parity of the set is even and vice versa .",
    "we can translate this principle into the domain of ising interactions with the help of an ancilla spin @xmath55 , @xmath56 the equivalence `` @xmath57 '' is here defined as the existence of a one - to - one mapping between the groundstate - manifolds in the sense that the states are identical for the non - ancilla spins .",
    "additionally all remaining states of the embedding constraint have to be separated by a gap from the groundstate - manifold .",
    "the overall sign of the embedding constraint above is actually arbitrary which is due to the fact that any gauge transformation that interchanges the meaning of `` up '' and `` down '' states of the ancilla spin leaves the physics invariant however changes the overall sign of the embedding constraint .",
    "the constraint decomposition technique is valid for odd @xmath58 and even @xmath59 parity constraints .",
    "the 4-body ising constraint of paqc is a even party constraint which is why we have chosen to further illustrate even parity decomposition .",
    "the reasoning for odd parity constraints parallels the reasoning given in the following .",
    "the groundstate manifold of the embedding constraint for an even parity constraint @xmath59 is characterised by a odd parity for the subset a including the ancilla spin @xmath55 and the subset b including the same ancilla spin @xmath55 . if the ancilla spin @xmath55 is in the spin up state , then both of the subsets a and b have to have odd parity in order for the state to be in the groundstate - manifold . if the ancilla spin @xmath55 is in the spin down state both subsets have to have even parity .",
    "the ancilla spin @xmath55 therefore `` communicates '' the parity information between subsets .",
    "therefore the set of spins not including the ancilla spin behaves as if the full many - body ising constraint were implemented without the need for any perturbative elimination of the ancilla spin .",
    "the gap of the embedding constraint above , c.f .",
