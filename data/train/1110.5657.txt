    "the gist of our results is that covering information about @xmath3 _",
    "i.e. _ the ability to plot @xmath3 on a computer screen with arbitrarily good resolution ) is not sufficient for the computation of such an arc @xmath6 , but that covering information combined with local connectivity information is .",
    "such an arc @xmath6 is called an _ accessing arc_. more generally , when @xmath4 and @xmath2 are points in the plane , and when @xmath7 is a subset of the plane , we say that an arc @xmath3 from @xmath4 to @xmath2 _",

    "in addition to these connections , the problem of computing accessing arcs seems to be an intrinsically interesting problem that admits many intriguing variations such as higher - dimensional versions , computable metric spaces , and rectifiable or computably rectifiable accessing arcs .",
    "our investigations first lead us to consider the situation in figure [ fig : situation ] in which we have an open disk @xmath10 , an arc @xmath3 , a point @xmath2 in @xmath11 , and a point @xmath4 in @xmath12 . from our computability questions",

    "moreover , the bound in this theorem can be computed from sufficient information about @xmath10 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
