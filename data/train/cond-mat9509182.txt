    "the interest in the distribution of spectral weight in the optical conductivity of correlated electron systems has been revived by the improvement of the quality of the experimental data in various systems @xcite .",
    "the traditional methods used in the strong correlation problem , exact diagonalization of small clusters @xcite , slave boson approaches@xcite , and perturbative calculations , have not been very successful in describing the interesting transfer of optical weight which takes place as a function of temperature in the strong correlation regime .",
    "recently , much progress has been achieved by mapping lattice models into impurity models embedded in an effective medium .",
    "this technique , the local impurity selfconsistent approximation ( lisa ) @xcite , is a dynamical mean field theory that becomes exact in the limit of large number of spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "for instance , the hubbard and the anderson lattice model can be mapped onto the anderson impurity model subject to different selfconsistency conditions for the conduction electron bath @xcite .",
    "these resulting selfconsistent impurity problems can be analyzed by a variety of numerical techniques @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply this approach to the study of the optical conductivity in regard of the recent experiments in @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we take the view that the low energy optical properties of @xmath0 can be modeled by a one band hubbard model , while @xmath2 and @xmath3 are described by a periodic anderson model @xcite .",
    "the modeling of the experimental systems requires a large value of the coulomb repulsion @xmath4 .",
    "our main goal in this work is to demonstrate that simplified models of strongly interacting systems treated with the lisa , can account for the main qualitative features that are observed experimentally in strongly correlated electron compounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ met ] we summarize the mean field equations for the model hamiltonians and the expressions for the calculation of the optical conductivity and the optical sum rule . in section [ phys ]",
    "we present and intuitive pedagogical discussion the physical content of the solution of the model hamiltonians in the large dimensional limit .",
    "section [ res ] is dedicated to a thorough discussion of the optical conductivity results .",
    "we discuss the effects of magnetic frustration on the spectral functions of the hubbard model . and the effects of temperature and disorder on the optical spectra of the anderson lattice .",
    "the theoretical calculations are carried out using exact diagonalization ( ed ) and iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) techniques , and compared with texperimental results on various systems .",
    "we stress that the use of ipt allow us to access physically interesting regimes which are outside the scope of the quantum monte carlo method , and that the exact diagonalization technique is used to confirm that the results presented are genuine features of the hubbard model in infinite dimensions and not artifacts of the ipt .",
    "the conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "our ed approach to the solution of correlated models in large dimensions is based on the use continuous fractions .",

    "when dealing with strongly correlated electron systems , in a frequency range where few of the bands are believed to be important , it is customary to work with an effective model with one or two bands , such as the hubbard or the periodic anderson model .",
    "the current operator is thus projected onto the low energy sector and is expressed in terms of creation and destruction operators of the relevant bands ( i.e. , @xmath56 for the hubbard and anderson model ) .",

    "@xmath59 depends on the temperature and strength of interactions , therefore , for these few bands models , the optical weight sum rule will depend on them as well . if the projection onto a few band model is valid , this result also implicitly indicates that a portion of the optical spectral weight ( the weight not exhausted by @xmath59 ) is transferred to much higher energies , that is , to the bands that were excluded by the projection to low energies .",
    "in this paper we do not address the question of the validity of the low energy projection onto a few band model .",
    "instead we focus on the consequences of this assumption on the redistribution of the optical weight within a mean field theory that is exact in the limit of large dimensions .",
    "our main conclusion is that there is a considerable temperature dependence of the integrated spectral weight appearing in the sum rule .    in infinite dimensions",
    ", @xmath42 can be expressed in terms of the one particle spectrum of the current carrying electrons @xcite : @xmath60 with @xmath61 $ ] being the spectral representation of the green function of the lattice conduction electrons , @xmath62 the lattice constant , and @xmath63 the volume of the unit cell .",
    "as we anticipated , the kinetic energy is related to the conductivity by the sum rule @xmath64    an important result , which will be demonstrated later on , is the notable dependence of the plasma frequency @xmath65 with temperature .",
    "this feature will be seen to emerge as consequence that correlation effects generate small energy scales ( e.g. the `` kondo temperature '' of the associated impurity ) .",
    "it is the competition between the small scales and the temperature that gives rise to an unusual temperature dependence to the integrated optical spectral weight .    at @xmath66 ,",
    "the optical conductivity of a metallic correlated electron system can be parametrized by @xcite @xmath67 where the coefficient in front of the @xmath68-function is the drude weight and @xmath69 is the renormalized plasma frequency . in the presence of disorder @xmath70",
    "is replaced by a lorentzian of width @xmath71 .",
    "evaluating equation ( [ sigma ] ) at @xmath66 one finds in mean field theory that , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the quasiparticle weight . for the hubbard model in infinite dimensions the expression above further simplifies , and it only depends on the density of states @xmath74",
    "the solution of the mean field equations shows that at low temperatures the model has a metal insulator transition ( mott - hubbard transition ) at an intermediate value of the interaction @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the metallic side is characterized by a density of states with a three peak structure : a central feature at the fermi energy that narrows as one moves towards @xmath76 from below , and two broader incoherent features that develop at @xmath77 , namely , the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "they have a width @xmath78 and their spectral weight increases as the transition is approached .",
    "the insulator side , for @xmath79 , presents only these last two high frequency features , which are separated by an excitation gap of size @xmath80 .",
    "the different structures of the dos ( fig.[fig1 ] ) give rise to very different optical responses .",
    "= 2.9truein    lets first consider the insulator , which is simpler . in this case ,",
    "optical transitions are possible from the lower to the upper hubbard band .",
    "we therefore expect the optical spectrum that results from the convolution ( [ sigma ] ) to display a single broad feature that extends approximately from @xmath81 to @xmath82 ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "a negligible temperature dependence of the spectra is expected , as long as @xmath83 . on the other hand , in the metallic case",
    ", the low temperature optical spectrum displays various contributions : _",
    "i ) _ a narrow low frequency peak that is due to transitions within the quasiparticle resonance , in the @xmath66 limit this peaks becomes a @xmath84function and is the drude part of the optical response . _",
    "ii ) _ at frequencies of order @xmath85 an incoherent feature of width @xmath86 emerges due to transitions between the hubbard bands and the central resonance . _",
    "iii ) _ a last contribution at frequency @xmath87 appears due to transitions between the hubbard bands .",
    "this is a broad feature of width @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we expect an optical spectrum which is schematically drawn in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is important to realize that , unlike the insulator , a notable temperature dependence of the spectra is to be expected .",
    "there is a low energy scale @xmath89 that corresponds to the temperature below which coherent quasiparticle excitations are sustained .",
    "it roughly corresponds to the the width of the resonance at the fermi energy @xmath90 . as @xmath91",
    "is then increased and becomes comparable to @xmath89 , the quasiparticles are destroyed , and in consequence , the contributions to the optical spectra associated with them , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , rapidly decrease .    it should be clear that in our previous discussion we have assumed that the system does not order magnetically , as paramagnetic solutions were considered .",
    "this situation can in fact be realized by introduction of disorder ( e.g. a random distribution of @xmath8 ) or next nearest neighbor hopping , and avoids the artificial nesting property of the bipartite lattice @xcite .",
    "we now present a schematic discussion of the periodic anderson model solution . in this case",
    "there are two different types of electrons , the @xmath14-electrons which form a band and the @xmath11-electrons with localized orbitals . in the non - interacting particle - hole",
    "symmetric case , the hybridization amplitude @xmath13 opens a gap in the @xmath94electron density of states @xmath95 . on the other hand ,",
    "the original @xmath84function peak of the localized @xmath15electrons broadens by hybridizing with the conduction electrons and also opens a gap @xmath96 .",
    "when the effect of the interaction term is considered , as the local repulsive @xmath4 is increased , one finds that for low frequencies the non - interacting picture which was just described still holds , however , with the bare hybridization @xmath13 being renormalized to a smaller value @xmath97 .",
    "thus , we say we have a hybridization band insulator with the hybridization amplitude renormalized by interactions .",
    "this can also be interpreted by considering that the interacting @xmath15electrons form a band of `` kondo - like '' quasiparticles , that allows to define a coherence temperature @xmath98 similar to the @xmath89 introduced before .",
    "this coherent band further opens a gap due to the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "this is the well known scenario that is born out from slave boson mean field theory and variational calculations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the present dynamical mean field theory also captures the high energy part of the @xmath15electron density of states that develops incoherent satellite peaks at frequencies @xmath77 with spectral weight that is transferred from low frequencies .",
    "consequently , the @xmath94electron density of states is mainly made of a central broad band of half - width @xmath34 and a gap at the center that gets narrower as @xmath99 . also , it develops some small high frequency structures , that result from the hybridization with the d - electrons . in fig.[fig2 ] we schematically present the density of states for the @xmath14 and @xmath15electrons . as in the hubbard model",
    ", we assume the absence of magnetic long range order ( mlro ) . for a study of the magnetic phase of the anderson model see ref ..    = 2.9truein    since the @xmath15sites are localized orbitals , only the @xmath94electrons contribute to the optical response of this system . at @xmath66 ,",
    "following the previous interpretation in terms of a renormalized non - interacting hybridization band insulator and equation ( [ sigma ] ) , we expect to find an optical conductivity spectra with a gap @xmath100 , which decreases as the interaction is increased .",
    "we also expect that @xmath101 , as the first corresponds to the _ indirect _ gap from the density of states @xmath102 , while the second is the _ direct _ gap @xmath103 that is defined as the minimum energy for interband transitions at a given @xmath104 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "we do not expect any other important contributions to the optical response since , as we argued before , the incoherent high frequency structures of the @xmath94electron density of states do not carry much spectral weight . in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "we schematically present the optical response at @xmath66 .    as the temperature",
    "is increased the gap in the optical conductivity becomes gradually filled . at high temperatures a simple picture of electrons scattering off local moments emerge .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes , would naively occur at a temperature of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we note that in the hubbard model and in the periodic anderson model the destruction of a coherent quasiparticle state that sets the low energy scale of the system has rather opposite effects in the optical response . in the first case ,",
    "the correlated metallic state is destroyed as @xmath91 becomes of the order of the renormalized fermi energy , and the drude part of the optical response is transferred to higher energies as the insulating state sets in . in the second case , however , the destruction of the coherent excitations is accompanied by the thermal closing of the gap in the density of states that turns the system metallic . as a consequence , the gap of the optical response is filled with spectral weight from higher energies to become a broad drude - like feature .",
    "we will discuss the results for the model in regard of different experimental data on the @xmath0 system .",
    "vanadium oxide has three @xmath105 orbitals per @xmath13 atom which are filled with two electrons .",
    "two electrons ( one per @xmath13 ) are engaged in a strong cation - cation bond , leaving the remaining two in a twofold degenerate @xmath106 band @xcite .",
    "lda calculations give a bandwidth of @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model ignores the degeneracy of the band which is crucial in understanding the magnetic structure @xcite , but captures the interplay of the electron - electron interactions and the kinetic energy .",
    "this delicate interplay of itinerancy and localization is responsible for many of the anomalous properties of this compound , and it is correctly predicted by this simplified model .",
    "experimentally one can vary the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath108 , by introducing @xmath109 and @xmath13 vacancies or by applying presure or chemical substitution of the cation .",
    "we can use experimental data to extract approximate parameters to be used as input to our model .",
    "in particular , from the experimental optical conductivity data in the insulating phase , a rather accurate determination can be made because , as it is apparent from the spectra , the low frequency contribution is mainly due to a single peak @xcite . in regard of our schematic discussion of the previous section",
    ", the position of the maximum should approximately correspond to the parameter @xmath4 that corresponds to transitions from the lower to the upper hubbard band .",
    "also , according to the picture of the previous section , the total width of the peak should be @xmath88 which is twice the width of the hubbard bands .",
    "therefore , we can approximately estimate the parameter @xmath108 as the distance from position of the peak maximum to the frequency where the feature decreased to half its height ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "= 2.9truein    the parameters from the metallic optical conductivity spectra are not so easily extracted .",
    "however , we can still obtain a rather precise determination by considering the _ difference spectra _ between the data at @xmath110 and at @xmath111 ( see inset of fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "= 2.9truein    as we shall later discuss in detail , it turns out that the feature that appears in the difference spectra at a frequency @xmath112 can be associated with the parameter @xmath113 .",
    "this is also intuitively suggested by the schematic discussion of the previous section , as this feature corresponds to the enhancement of transitions from the lower hubbard band to the central resonance at the fermi level and from the resonance to the upper hubbard band which are at a distance @xmath114 .",
    "the value for the parameter @xmath115 in the metallic phase was determined by noting that : i ) _ a priori _ there is no reason to expect that it should be much different than in the insulating phase ( unlike the parameter @xmath4 which could be modified by screening ) ; ii ) it is consistent with the recent lda calculation that gives a half - width of @xmath116 for the narrow bands at the fermi level @xcite ; iii ) despite the lack of very good experimental resolution the value is consistent with both the optical data that we reproduce in fig.[fig4 ] and photoemission experiments @xcite ; iv ) as will be shown later in the paper , this estimated value will allow to gather in a single semi - quantitative consistent picture the optical conductivity results with the @xmath0 phase diagram and experimental results for the slope of the specific heat .",
    "the extracted parameters along with the values for the size of the optical gap ( in the insulators ) and the total optical spectral weight are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".experimental parameters for the model . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig.[fig5 ] we display the phase diagram of the model in large dimensions generalized to include @xmath117 hopping @xmath118 and @xmath119 hopping @xmath120 .",
    "the condition @xmath121 keeps the bare density of states @xmath122 invariant .",

    "the extra hopping provides a magnetically frustrating interaction @xcite .",
    "this phase diagram obtained for @xmath125 has the same topology as the experimental one @xcite .",
    "frustration lowers the @xmath126 well below the second order @xmath127 point @xcite . using the parameters of table [ table1 ] , @xmath128 , which is only within less than a factor of 2 from the experimental result .",
    "the dotted line indicates a crossover separating a good metal at low @xmath91 and a semiconductor at higher @xmath91 . between these states",
    "@xmath129 has an anomalous rapid increase , as is shown in the results of fig.[fig5a ] .",
    "the reason for this feature can be traced to the thermal destruction of the coherent central quasiparticle peak in the @xmath130 .",
    "we find the behavior of @xmath129 to be in good agreement with the experimental results of mc whan _ et al .",
    "another crossover is indicated by a shaded area , it separates a semiconducting region with a gap @xmath131 comparable with @xmath91 from a good insulator where @xmath83 , consequently the crossover temperature increases linearly with @xmath4 and the horizontal width of the crossover region becomes broader with increasing @xmath91 .",
    "this crossover is characterized by a sudden increase in @xmath132 as function of @xmath4 at a fix @xmath91 ( inset fig.[fig5 ] ) .",

    "= 2.9truein    = 2.9truein      in infinite dimensions the optical conductivity is a weighted convolution of two one particle spectral functions .",
    "the one particle spectral function is , therefore , the basic building block which gives rise to the various features of the optical conductivity . in this subsection",
    "we consider the nature of the spectral functions with magnetic long range order ( mlro ) .",
    "the understanding of the qualitative differences and similarities between solutions with and without mlro is relevant in regard of systems , like @xmath0 , that present both antiferromagnetic ( afi ) and paramagnetic ( pi ) insulating phases .",
    "results for the corresponding optical spectra will follow in the next section .    in figs",
    "[ fig5b ] and [ fig5c ] we respectively show the single particle spectra of the pi and afi insulating solutions for different values of the interaction @xmath4 .",

    "it is interesting to realize from these results , which correspond to rather large values of the interaction @xmath4 , that the spectra in both cases are roughly similar .",
    "they both present a lower and upper hubbard bands at energies @xmath135 with a bandwidth @xmath78 and a corresponding gap @xmath80 .    in particular , the pi solution , merely presents a rigid shift of the incoherent hubbard bands as the interaction @xmath4 is varied , which is reminiscent of hubbard s solution to the model @xcite . on the other hand , in the afi case , the shape of the density of states follows from the fact that the sublattice magnetization is basically saturated at these large values of the interaction .    at @xmath136 , the largest value of the interactions considered , we observe that the shape of the spectra of @xmath137 becomes very similar to the corresponding one in the disordered case .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the magnetic exchange scale @xmath138 vanishes as @xmath4 becomes large .",
    "as one decreases the strength of the interaction , we observe that the afi spectra become increasingly different from the pi ones . in the former",
    "there is a transfer of spectral weight that occurs within the bands , from the higher to the lower frequencies .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that , as the scale @xmath139 becomes increasingly relevant , the spectra acquire a more coherent character .",
    "the `` piling up '' that occurs with the transfer of spectral weight as @xmath4 is reduced , is the precursor of the weak coupling inverse square root singularity in the low frequency part of the density of states .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent photoemission experiments in @xmath0 report the presence of a small anomalous enhancement in the lower frequency edge of the spectrum in the afi phase .",
    "this feature may be interpreted from the previous results as evidence of the transfer of weight within the hubbard bands .    a complementary perspective on the results that we just discussed is obtained by looking at the @xmath104-resolved spectra given by the imaginary part of the green function @xmath140 which reads , @xmath141 in the large @xmath11 limit the green functions are labeled by the energy @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one can still think of this quantity as the analogous of the @xmath1resolved spectra if one notes that the @xmath142 goes from @xmath143 to @xmath108 as it traverses the band ( the dispersion is linear in the non interacting case ) .",
    "thus , we can associate the `` zone center vector '' @xmath144 with the @xmath71 point of the bz , and the `` nesting vectors '' @xmath145 with the commensurate @xmath146 point . in figs.[fig5d ] and [ fig5e ] we show the @xmath142-resolved spectra for the different values of the interaction considered before . from the inspection of the spectra we observe that in the low @xmath139 case for @xmath136 the single particle spectra remain basically unmodified as we scan the @xmath142 `` wave vectors '' , which indicates the very incoherent character of the single particle excitations .",
    "on the other hand , as we lower @xmath4 and the scale @xmath139 becomes larger , we note the emergence of a peak in the @xmath147 case for small values of @xmath142 .",
    "notice , also , the more dispersive character of the excitations .",
    "= 2.9truein    = 2.9truein    an important parameter of the theory is the degree of magnetic frustration .",
    "frustration is necessary not only to obtain the observed phase diagram of @xmath148 @xcite but to account for the general shape of its angular integrated photoemission spectra @xcite .",
    "we can summarize the results of this section by saying that the ed solutions indicate that as the degree of frustration is reduced and as @xmath149 is reduced , the spectral function develops more dispersion , and the excitations at low energy are more coherent ( i.e. the imaginary part of the self energy is smaller ) .",
    "many experiments place @xmath148 in the regime of strong frustration , while the observation of dispersive features in the insulating phase of @xmath150 @xcite may be explained by a lower degree of magnetic frustration in this compound .",
    "we shall now briefly consider the antiferromagnetic metallic state ( afm ) that occurs upon the introduction of next nearest neighbor hopping in the nested lattice ( i.e. partial frustration ) at small ( but finite ) values of @xmath4 ( see phase diagram in fig.[fig5 ] ) .",

    "it is very interesting to note that the peak structure of the density of states seems to be divided into low frequency features near @xmath154 , and higher frequency structures at energies of the order of the band - width ( which is also comparable to @xmath4 for the chosen parameters ) .",
    "this is even more clear in the antiferromagnetic metallic state with partial frustration .",
    "= 2.9truein    we note that our results are qualitatively similar to the recent exact diagonalization results for the @xmath155 model and also to quantum monte carlo results for the hubbard model on 2-dimensional finite size lattices with a choice of parameters comparable to the one used here @xcite .",
    "furthemore , the similarity to the physics found in finite dimensional finite size lattices becomes more striking by comparing the @xmath142-resolved spectra of fig.[fig6a ] with the ones obtained by preuss _",

    "<S> we study the transfer of spectral weight in the photoemission and optical spectra of strongly correlated electron systems . within the lisa , that becomes exact in the limit of large lattice coordination , we consider and compare two models of correlated electrons , the hubbard model and the periodic anderson model . </S>",
    "<S> the results are discussed in regard of recent experiments . in the hubbard model , we predict an anomalous enhancement optical spectral weight as a function of temperature in the correlated metallic state which is in qualitative agreement with optical measurements in @xmath0 . we argue that anomalies observed in the spectroscopy of the metal are connected to the proximity to a crossover region in the phase diagram of the model . in the insulating phase , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an excellent agreement with the experimental data and present a detailed discussion on the role of magnetic frustration by studying the @xmath1resolved single particle spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the periodic anderson model are discussed in connection to recent experimental data of the kondo insulators @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the model can successfully explain the different energy scales that are associated to the thermal filling of the optical gap , which we also relate to corresponding changes in the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the optical sum rule is obtained and its relevance for the interpretation of the experimental data discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we argue that the large scattering rate measured in kondo insulators can not be described by the periodic anderson model . </S>"
