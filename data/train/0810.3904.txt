    "<S> by using canonical monte carlo simulation , the liquid - vapor phase diagram , surface tension , interface width , and pressure for the mie(n , m ) model fluids are calculated for six pairs of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that after certain re - scaling of fluid density the corresponding states rule can be applied for the calculations of the thermodynamic properties of the mie model fluids , and for some real substances .    among the intermolecular effective interaction potentials , the lennard - jones one is by </S>",
    "<S> far the most widely used for approximating the physics of simple nonpolar molecules in all phases of matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the attractiveness of the lj model is mainly due to its more convenient mathematical form than to its accuracy in representing the properties of real fluids . </S>",
    "<S> some modifications of the lj potential , like exp-6 @xcite or the family of mie(n , </S>",
    "<S> m ) potentials @xcite , have shown to be useful for the description of thermodynamic and dynamic properties of some real substances . </S>",
    "<S> the mie(n , m ) pair potential , which is just a general form of the lj model , is defined as ,    @xmath2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the interparticle distance reduced by the particle diameter , which is chosen to be the unit length , @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the well depth . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the system is defined as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> + recently , both theory and molecular simulations have been used to compute the properties of the mie(n , m ) model fluids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mie fluid potential is often said to be short - ranged , however , for any finite system size , the potential is not rigorously zero at a distance of the half box length where the potential is typically truncated . </S>",
    "<S> some approaches were proposed for dealing with the long - range tail of the potential @xcite . perhaps , due to the commonly used procedure of potential cut - off during molecular simulations , there are lot of contradictions in the literature . as an example , the recent results of okumura and yonezawa @xcite have indicated that the coexistence curve for the mie ( n,6 ) models scaled by the critical temperature and density practically coincides with each other , when @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> dunikov and co - workers @xcite have also demonstrated that the coexistence and interfacial properties of the lj fluid approximately follows the corresponding state ( cs ) principle , if calculated with different cut - off s of the interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , galliro and co - workers @xcite , by studying modified forms of the mie(n , m ) potential , found that no cs approach is possible between potentials having different repulsive exponents as well as different functional forms .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well accepted that cs rule permits the prediction of unknown properties of many fluids from the known properties of a few @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its application to the model potential fluids allows to avoid the usually timeconsuming molecular simulations , and also makes possible the utilization of some important developments in statistical mechanics which would otherwise be prohibited by computational difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> firstly the cs rule was derived by van der waals based on his well - known equation of state ,    @xmath8    where the variables were reduced by their critical values , @xmath9 ( reduced number density or inverse molar volume ) , @xmath10 ( reduced temperature ) , and @xmath11 ( reduced pressure ) . </S>",
    "<S> later , the cs principle was extended by introducing additional parameters to the study of various types of molecular fluids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in general , macroscopic cs law states that all substances obey the same equation of state in terms of the reduced variables , or , in other words , the state of a system may be described by any two of the three variables : pressure , density , and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> + very recently @xcite , we have studied the application of the cs principle for the hard sphere attractive yukawa ( hay ) fluid . </S>",
    "<S> this model fluid is far from being conformal @xcite , neither its reduced second virial coefficient @xmath12 evaluated at the critical temperature for various @xmath13 ( range of attractive tail ) is constant . however , we have shown , that for different values of @xmath13 , hay fluid obeys the cs law for various thermodynamic properties . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the studies of refs.@xcite where the approximation of the constant value of @xmath12 was used , we have proposed a new rescaling of fluid density , that allowed us to obtain a relation like eq.([csl ] ) for the hay fluid . in ref.@xcite we have suggested that the same kind of rescaling may be universal for different pair potentials , what afterwards has been partially confirmed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present investigation is to show , by applying canonical monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , that different thermodynamic properties of the mie fluid obey the principle of the corresponding states . unlike the previous studies @xcite , here we present the simulation data not only for the vapor - liquid coexistence densities , but also results of the surface tension , interfacial width , and supercritical pressure calculations .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we study the systems with two particular cases of the potential ( [ mie ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the one - parameter mie(2m , m ) model , in which increasing @xmath0 leads to a shorter ranged potential . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are focused on three values of @xmath0 : @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> another potential studied here is mie(n,6 ) . in this case , like in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , only the repulsive part is manipulated ; three potentials with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are considered . </S>",
    "<S> + the applied simulation method is the same that was used in our previous works@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , the simulations of the vapor - liquid interfaces were performed in a parallelepiped cell with sides @xmath18 , and @xmath19 was chosen to be , at least , three times longer than @xmath20 ; the number of particles inside the box was @xmath21 , depending on the thermodynamic conditions considered . </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three directions . the pressure of the supercritical mie(n , m ) fluid was calculated in a cubic simulation cell with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we used @xmath23 for mie(12,6 ) and @xmath24 for other systems . </S>",
    "<S> as we verified , these values of @xmath25 are sufficiently long to omit the influence of the potential truncation on the averaged results presented below . </S>",
    "<S> + coexistence vapor @xmath26 and liquid @xmath27 densities , and the interfacial width , @xmath28 , were obtained at the end of each simulation run by fitting the density profiles , @xmath29 , to the following hyperbolic tangent function    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the position of the gibbs dividing surface . </S>",
    "<S> the critical density and temperature for these model fluids were calculated by using the rectilinear diameters law@xcite with the universal value of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical pressures were estimated on the base of the clausius - clapeyron equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> critical parameters are given in table i. + fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . depicts the reduced density , @xmath33 , as a function of the reduced temperature , @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that the coexistence curves of mie(2m , m ) fluid with @xmath35 and @xmath15 , and mie(n,6 ) fluid with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 map onto a single master curve . as was mentioned above , the similar behavior for mie(n,6 ) and lj fluids has been reported in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm that the vapor - liquid phase diagrams of any mie(n , m ) potential obey the cs law , at least in the range of considered parameters . + as usual @xcite , the interfacial tension is calculated by    @xmath36\\bigg\\},\\ ] ]    where , @xmath37 are the components of the pressure tensor .    our results of the surface tension are presented in its reduced form @xcite ,    @xmath38    the values of @xmath39 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath34 are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the six sets of the surface tension data form a single master curve , which means that the surface tension of mie fluid also obeys the cs theorem . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , application of the corresponding state rule may avoid the time consuming calculations of the surface tension for other pairs of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 if the critical parameters are known . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the master curve in fig.2 is slightly different from its hay fluid counterpart reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and is represented by the following empirical equation , + @xmath40    which resembles the expression proposed by guggenheim to correlate the experimental data @xcite .    in many engineering problems ( for example , for dispersant applications in petroleum and pharmaceutical industries ) it is of high importance to predict the vapor - liquid interfacial width as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> since such calculations are not trivial due to the spacial fluctuations of the interfaces , application of the cs principle might be of high utility . </S>",
    "<S> since the value of surface tension is inversely proportional to the interface width @xcite , it is natural to expect that the rescaling of @xmath28 must be like eq.([gamma ] ) ,    @xmath41    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 the reduced widths of the vapor - liquid interface , @xmath42 , as a function of @xmath34 are shown . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the interface width curves of the mie fluids are almost overlapped with each other , taking into account the error bars . </S>",
    "<S> it confirms that calculation of interfacial width can also be simplified by application of the cs principle with rescaling ( [ delta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our preliminary calculations of @xmath42 for some parameters of hay fluids indicate that it is practically the same as the one presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> + finally , we analyze the reduced pressure @xmath43 as a function of reduced density @xmath44 , defined as    @xmath45    such rescaling of fluid density has been proposed and tentatively justified in our previous work @xcite , where the extended corresponding states law has been applied for the description of the @xmath46 properties the hay fluid . </S>",
    "<S> + the values of @xmath43 for three reduced temperatures are presented in fig.4 ; as seen , the reduced pressure data for all mie fluid potentials in question match on the same master curves at each value of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the results of @xmath43 for the mie(n , m ) family fluids and the hay fluid @xcite practically coincide . </S>",
    "<S> the best agreement is reached at the lowest temperature and densities ; only slight discrepancy , almost within the error bars , is observed at high fluid pressures , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy is expected to be more pronounced at higher reduced pressures . by using the critical parameters presented in table ii , we also show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 the reduced pressure for the three real fluids , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . as expected @xcite , the pressure of argon </S>",
    "<S> is predicted quite well by the mie potential model , while some deviation of @xmath50 and @xmath49 pressures from the simulation data may be attributed to the slight non sphericity of these gas molecules .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the vapor - liquid equilibrium and interfacial properties of mie(n , m ) fluids using canonical monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the coexistence densities and the surface tension , as well as the width of the vapor - liquid interface obey the corresponding states principle . on the base of new accurate critical parameters ( evaluated from our mc simulations ) , </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the critical compressibility factor is around @xmath51 , which agrees well with experimental data for some real substances@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the new density rescaling , @xmath52 , is universal for the calculation of the reduced pressure of mie(n , m ) , hay @xcite , and sutherland fluids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the proposed new criteria could be of relevant help for testing new theoretical approaches for the investigation of the model , as well as real fluid systems @xcite . </S>"
