    "the pioneering history of radio telescopes is in some ways the history of the quest for higher angular resolution .",
    "the angular resolution of a radio interferometer is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is baseline length or antenna spacing .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath1 was usually much less than 1,000 km for connected interferometers . in order to push this limit ,",
    "vlbi ( very - long - baseline interferometry ) was invented .",
    "vlbi is made by connecting existing radio telescopes with magnetic tapes instead of cables",
    ". then vlbi observes radio sources with relatively high brightness temperature like agn and astronomical masers .",
    "superluminal motion of agn jet was shown only by very high angular resolution of vlbi . however",
    ", ground - based vlbi has an upper limit of angular resolution because @xmath1 must not be larger than the diameter of the earth , 13,000 km . in order to push this limit ,",
    "space vlbi was formulated .",
    "space vlbi is an interferometer connecting radio telescopes in orbit and ground - base ones .",
    "since the baseline length of space vlbi can extend beyond the diameter of the earth , angular resolution of space vlbi is free from this limit .",
    "however , it is very difficult to set a radio telescope in orbit .",
    "space vlbi was realized in 1997 as the first space vlbi project , vsop1 ( vlbi space observatory program)[1,2 ] , after some preceding experiments and vast amounts of effort .",
    "the spacecraft for vsop1 is known as the first dedicated space vlbi satellite , _",
    "this was launched by a m - v rocket of institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) from unchinoura space center ( usc ) .",
    "the angular resolution of vsop1 is 3 times better than that of ground - based vlbi at 1.6 and 5 ghz ( vsop1 also had 22-ghz band system , which unfortunately suffered a serious loss of sensitivity at the launch ) .",
    "seven hundred observations of agn jets were made in the mission lifetime of 7 years .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic display of the comparison between space vlbi and ground - based vlbi . the second vlbi space observatory program ( vsop2 ) is a successor of vsop1 [ 3 ] .",
    "_ astro - g _ is the satellite for vsop2 , which will be launched by isas / jaxa in fiscal year 2012 .",
    "the construction project of _ astro - g _ has been started since july 2007 .",
    "this project is a joint - project between isas , naoj ( national astronomical observatory , japan ) and the universities .",
    "now , basic design of the satellite and developments of several components for _ astro - g _ are ongoing .",
    "a review of a basic design of the satellite ( pdr : preliminary design review ) is scheduled at march of 2009 .",
    "after decision of the design ( cdr : critical design review ) in 2009 , we will start the production of the flight model of _ astro - g_. this satellite will be launched with an h - iia rocket from tanegashima space center ( tnsc ) of jaxa .",
    "vsop2 has 10 times higher angular resolution , 10 times higher frequency , and 10 times higher sensitivity compared to vsop1 .",
    "vsop2 will be an astronomical tool with unprecedented angular resolution in all wavelength to explore innermost regions of agn and astronomical masers .",
    "the vsop2 programme foresees a powerful astronomical instrument involving _ astro - g _ , ground radio telescopes , tracking stations , and correlators . for this reason , isas alone",
    "can not all different aspects of this complex project , which will be made in collaboration with international space and ground - base partners",

    "artist s impression of the _ astro - g _ satellite around perigee . ]",
    "here we describe the expected imaging capability of vsop2 . figure 2 shows an artist s impression of the _ astro - g _ satellite around perigee .",
    "the total size of the _ astro - g _ satellite is as large as a tennis coat .",
    "the observing frequency bands of the _ astro - g _ satellite are 8 , 22 , and 43 ghz .",
    "there are many large radio telescopes at 8 ghz in the world , being this frequency band used for down - link satellite communication .",
    "the participation of many telescopes in vsop2 increases its imaging capability .",
    "the 22 and 43 ghz bands involve h@xmath2o ( @xmath3 ghz ) and sio ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ghz ) masers , respectively .",
    "these frequency bands are summarized in table 1 .",
    "._astro - g _ parameters [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we can observe simultaneously dual polarizations at each frequency . however , we can not observe two frequencies at once because different frequency bands use the different feed horns . we can switch two frequencies at least within one minute .",
    "the bandwidth and the bit levels of the analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) of _",
    "astro - g _ are 128 mhz and 2 bit , or 256 mhz and 1 bit .",
    "ground - based vlbi radio telescopes record the signal to recording media , tape , disk , etc .",
    "in contrast , _ astro - g _ satellite has no recording media .",
    "it sends directly the vlbi - formatted data to the tracking stations .",
    "the data are sent through a broadband down link of @xmath6 mhz at 37.5 ghz with a bit rate of 1 gbps quadrature phase shift keying ( qpsk ) .",
    "simultaneously , the phase transfer carrier signal to the local oscillator system of the _ astro - g _ is sent through the up - link at 40 ghz .",
    "the ultra - wide band down - link may be also a technical challenge .",
    "figure 9 shows a block diagram of the observation and data link systems of the _ astro - g _ satellite .",
    "we plan at least 3 tracking stations in the world for obtaining sufficient observation time .",
    "however , isas has only one dedicated vlbi tracking station at usuda , japan .",
    "international collaboration is essential for the success of vsop2 .",
    "additionally , a tracking station in southern hemisphere is important for keeping a high observation efficiency of vsop2 .",
    "block diagram of observation and data link systems of _ astro - g _ satellite ]      _ astro - g _ needs a very high accuracy orbit determination for astrometry .",
    "we use both satellite laser ranging ( slr ) and gps systems for a high accuracy orbit determination .",
    "the accuracy of the orbit determination is required to be at least 10 cm to get any advantage against ground - base vlbi .",
    "the very high accuracy determination using gps may be also technical challenge .",
    "the altitude of _ astro - g _ around the apogee is much higher than that of a gps constellation . since the antenna of gps satellites",
    "is usually pointed to earth , _ astro - g _ around the apogee only receives the signal from the gps satellites located on the far side of earth .",
    "it is difficult to receive the signals from over four satellites , which are required to determine the orbit of _ astro - g _ directly .",
    "_ astro - g _ also has a corner cube reflector for satellite laser ranging at the earth - pointing system of ka - band link antenna .",
    "as mentioned previously , we need a world - wide collaboration for vsop2 both in space and ground telescopes to make resultant maps with sufficient quality and to give a sufficient quantity of observation time for international astronomical community . however , any international collaboration is a complicated issue .",
    "vsop1 formed the vsop international science council ( visc1 ) as an international body to provide guidance on scientific aspects related of the mission .",
    "we are acknowledging that visc1 functioned successfully in maximizing scientific result with vsop1 . in a similar fashion for vsop2",
    ", we formed visc2 .",
    "the primary function of visc2 will be to form an international consensus about issues relevant to science operation of the vsop2 mission .",
    "visc2 expects to have face - to - face meeting approximately twice per year and more frequently teleconferences .",
    "this work is based on cooperative activity of the _ astro - g _ project team ."
