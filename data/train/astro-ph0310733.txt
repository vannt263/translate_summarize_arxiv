    "since its launch in 1999 , the chandra x - ray observatory has been used to detect a large number of x - ray jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , where prominent radio jets were previously known to exist ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * and associated website ) .",
    "the recent report @xcite of an extended x - ray jet originating from the z=4.3 quasar gb  1508 + 5714 , where previous observations showed no obvious sign of extended radio emission , presents an interesting case .",
    "the x - ray feature is strong  well over 100 counts were detected from it in the @xmath090 ksec chandra exposure .",
    "an archival hst image helps rule out the possibility that it is due to a foreground galaxy or a gravitationally lensed image of the quasar @xcite . based on deep x - ray source counts",
    ", it has a low probability of being a random unassociated x - ray field source .",
    "as discussed by the previous authors , such detections of x - ray jets at large redshifts are actually to be expected as a natural consequence of the inverse compton ( ic ) off the cmb model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because the ( 1+z)@xmath1 dependence of the cmb energy density compensates for cosmological dimming of radiation , so that ic / cmb x - ray jets should remain detectable out to large cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the model has been successfully applied to account for x - ray jets in many other powerful quasars at more modest redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requiring that the jets are still highly relativistic on kilo - parsec scales , in order that the electrons in the jet frame see an adequately boosted photon source .",
    "however , the lack of a detection of the gb  1508 + 5714 jet at lower frequencies , along with only a rough constraint on the x - ray spectrum , could not rule out a synchrotron origin for the x - rays @xcite .",
    "a previous search in the radio for a proposed x - ray jet in another high redshift ( z=5.99 ) quasar , sdss  1306 + 0356 @xcite , yielded only an upper limit of @xmath20.1 mjy at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "distinguishing between the two possible emission processes is important , as they probe different energetic phenomena . in the case of synchrotron x - ray emission , the x - rays mark sites of particle acceleration with electrons accelerated up to @xmath3 with very short lifetimes ( e.g. m87 ; * ? ? ?",
    "when considered together with minimum energy / equipartition conditions , the ic / cmb model offers important constraints on the beaming , magnetic field , and jet power @xcite .",
    "both the ic and synchrotron interpretations of x - ray jet emission usually require a population of relativistic electrons emitting synchrotron radiation at lower ( radio ) frequencies .",
    "based on the x - ray flux and spectrum , the two models give different predictions of the radio component flux and spectrum . here , we report the detection of such a radio component coincident with the x - ray feature extending from gb  1508 + 5714 from an analysis of archival vla data .",
    "this supports its interpretation as an x - ray jet and we discuss the x - ray emission in the context of the new 1.4 ghz detection , along with the previously set optical , and a new 8.4 ghz limit . following @xcite and @xcite , h@xmath4 km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite are assumed throughout , so 1  = 6.871 kpc .",
    "two datasets which utilized the vla in its highest resolution a - configuration were obtained from the nrao archive .",
    "the data were calibrated in the nrao aips package @xcite and brought into difmap @xcite for editing , self - calibration , and imaging .",
    "the flux density scale was set on the vla 1999.2 scale using scans of 3c  286 as outlined in the vla calibrator manual @xcite .",
    "the 1.4 ghz dataset  a single five minute snapshot observation  yielded a 10@xmath8 detection of a 1.2 mjy feature extended from the quasar ( figure  [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "this feature is only about @xmath9 of the core flux ( @xmath10 mjy ) , so it is no surprise that the original investigators @xcite simply concluded that the quasar was an unresolved point source from these data .",
    "the measured off - source rms of @xmath110.12 mjy in the image is within 50@xmath12 of the thermal noise limit expected from the integration time .",
    "the resultant image has a dynamic range of almost 2,000:1 .",
    "the jet knot was modeled with an elliptical gaussian profile in both the ( u , v ) plane with difmap s ` modelfit ` utility , and in the map plane with the jmfit task in aips .",
    "the fits gave consistent measures of the deconvolved size : @xmath13 , elongated along the jet direction .",
    "we note that this is comparable to the beamsize for this observation so the source is consistent with being unresolved , and the size should be considered an upper limit .",
    "the separation from the core is 2.5  at a position angle of @xmath14 , and is comparable to that measured from the x - ray data .",
    "interestingly however , the peak in the x - ray jet appears somewhat closer to the nucleus than the radio centroid in the image overlay ( figure  [ fig-2 ] ) , by about one chandra acis pixel ( 0.492  per pixel ) , or equivalently @xmath03 kpc projected distance .",
    "the images were aligned by the cores to better than half of a pixel .",
    "@xcite found the peak in the x - ray jet to be @xmath02  away ( see also their subpixel re - binned radial profile published in their figure  2 ) , consistent with our qualitative assessment .",
    "@xcite stated the same peak to be @xmath03  distant from the nucleus , although we measured a smaller value off their figure  1 . much more apparent x - ray /",
    "radio offsets are seen in other powerful quasars ( e.g. up to @xmath02  in pks  1127145 ; * ? ? ?",
    "most , if not all of the x - ray counts from the gb  1508 + 5714 jet lie within the outermost radio contour in the vla image ( figure  [ fig-2 ] ) .    a 10-minute 8.4 ghz observation obtained on nov 3 , 1996 ( program ad388 ) yielded no detection of the radio jet .",
    "the measured off - source rms in the naturally weighted image ( @xmath00.35  beam ) is at about the expected thermal noise limit of 0.045 mjy . in order to judge",
    "if the non - detection was a result of the greater resolution in this image compared to the 1.4 ghz map , the 8.4 ghz dataset were tapered by different amounts .",
    "no outstanding feature appeared above the residual artifacts from the dirty beam .",
    "the measured rms at the expected position of the jet in a tapered image restored with a 0.75  beam is 0.3 mjy ( 3@xmath8 ) .",
    "this , along with the 1.4 ghz detection , is consistent with an @xmath150.8 radio spectrum ( @xmath16 ) , which agrees with the measured x - ray spectral index : 0.9@xmath170.36 @xcite and 0.92@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the jet knot in gb  1508 + 5714 is shown in figure  [ fig-3 ] .",
    "if the x - ray and radio emission are drawn from the same population of relativistic electrons emitting synchrotron radiation , the spectral index will be about what is measured between the 1.4 ghz and x - ray ( using 1.68@xmath1910@xmath20 ph/@xmath21/s / kev at 1 kev , reported by @xcite ) detections : @xmath22 = 0.73 .",
    "this is a typical value for the spectrum seen in radio jets @xcite , and is consistent with the measured x - ray spectrum of @xmath23 @xcite , and our constraint on the radio spectrum of @xmath240.8 ( the modest 8.4 ghz dataset does not preclude that the higher frequency radio emission , @xmath2540 ghz in the source frame , was actually resolved out ) . the optical hst limit ( 3@xmath8 ) from @xcite",
    "is not useful in this case , as it hovers over the radio - to - x - ray spectrum , and only weaker constraints are available at other optical bands @xcite .",
    "we can estimate an equipartition magnetic field of @xmath26  g , by adopting the observed @xmath22 value as the optically thin spectral index , and that the particles and field fill a fraction @xmath27 of a 2.9@xmath1910@xmath28 @xmath29 sphere , corresponding to the size upper limit derived from the radio detection .",
    "the factor @xmath30 is the ratio of magnetic field and electron energy densities , and @xmath31 is the lower energy cutoff of a power law distribution of relativistic particles .",
    "if we further assume @xmath30=1 , @xmath27=1 , and @xmath31=10 , then @xmath32 g , where @xmath33 is the unknown jet doppler beaming factor . in this field , electrons emitting the highest energy x - rays detected ( @xmath05 kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will have @xmath34 and short lifetimes ( @xmath050 years )  this would require continuous in - situ reacceleration of high energy particles in order that the x - ray jet not be a transient feature . at this high redshift , the energy density of the cmb already exceeds that of the equipartition field , even without bulk motion ( see below ) , so inverse compton losses will already be dominant .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath34 electrons calculated above is then a strict upper limit . taking this evidence together ,",
    "it is unlikely that the jet x - ray emission is dominated by synchrotron losses .",
    "an ic / cmb origin for this high redshift x - ray jet is preferred @xcite , and give us an additional constraint on the allowed range of magnetic field and jet doppler factor to the equipartition condition .",
    "the following expression is taken from @xcite :      where , @xmath36 is a dimensionless function of @xmath37 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath38 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath39 ergs @xmath40 for the cmb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose spectrum is peaked near @xmath41 ( 1+z ) hz @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath42 , the observed ratio of the compton ( x - ray ) and synchrotron ( radio ) fluxes ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 , observed at @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ) , allow us to estimate @xmath47 g. the corresponding equipartition calculation gives @xmath48 g , making the assumptions as above about @xmath30 , @xmath27 , and @xmath31 .",
    "both estimates of @xmath49-field are reasonably insensitive to the assumed spectral index : up to @xmath025@xmath12 smaller for @xmath50 , the measured x - ray spectral index . in order to reconcile the differences between the two equations ( opposite dependencies of @xmath49 on @xmath33 ) , a doppler factor greater than one",
    "is required .",
    "these two constraints bracket a plausible range of solutions around a 30@xmath51 g field and @xmath524 .",
    "@xcite arrived at similar conditions using slightly different assumptions .",
    "the unresolved nucleus is a variable x - ray and ( flat spectrum ) radio source with a very high x - ray to optical luminosity ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these observations have been taken as evidence of beaming on smaller scales , in the nucleus .",
    "the ratio of the monochromatic x - ray to radio luminosities ( i.e. , in @xmath53f@xmath54 ) of the gb  1508 + 5714 jet is 158 .",
    "this is one of the highest amongst the known x - ray jets which can be attributed to ic / cmb emission so far . in figure",
    "[ fig-4 ] , this ratio is plotted vs. redshift along with ic / cmb x - ray jets taken from the literature . the values seem to vary widely over 4 orders of magnitude , but predominantly show x - ray to radio ratios greater than 1 .",
    "the jet in gb  1508 + 5714 sees 12 orders of magnitude times greater energy density from the cmb than other jets at lower redshift , so it is tempting to speculate that its extreme redshift may account , to first order , for its large x - ray to radio luminosity ratio .",
    "this could similarly , account for the large x - ray to radio ratio limit obtained for the proposed x - ray jet in the z=5.99 quasar sdss  1306 + 0356 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig-4 ] ) .",
    "the observed monochromatic x - ray to radio luminosity ratios can be compared to what is expected in the ic / cmb model .",
    "we can obtain an expression for the expected ratio by rearranging equation  [ eqn-1 ] ( and setting @xmath42 ) :      the flux ratio is simply proportional to the ratio of the energy densities in the cmb and magnetic field , with a doppler factor term .",
    "this expression is plotted in figure  [ fig-4 ] for several different combinations of @xmath49 and @xmath33 , one of which , best suits the observations of gb  1508 + 5714 .",
    "it appears that varying @xmath49 and @xmath33 can account for the large spread of observed x - ray to radio luminosity ratios within a given redshift range .",
    "larger @xmath49-field , or more likely , smaller @xmath33 may account for the low values observed in q0957 + 561 ( z=1.41 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and 3c  9 ( z=2.012 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as they are known to have low radio core dominance , and weak vlbi structures @xcite compared to the other sources studied here . in all but 3c  179 ( z=0.846 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where multiple knot regions along the jet can be distinguished , the x - ray to radio flux ratio decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus , and can similarly be accounted for by varying @xmath56 . as discussed specifically in the case of 3c  273 ( z=0.158 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the variations along the jet may indicate deceleration , or increasing @xmath49 along the jet , possibly by compression in strong shocks .",
    "future detections in the redshift range @xmath024 or higher with large x - ray / radio flux ratios can lend further support to the currently preferred ic / cmb model used to explain the x - ray emission in quasar jets .",
    "an anonymous referee is thanked for making the point that compton losses are already dominant in the synchrotron x - ray case , and several other useful comments .",
    "the author is grateful to john wardle for his advice and encouragement throughout the course of this work , and to dan harris , aneta siemiginowska , dave roberts , and fabrizio tavecchio for useful discussions .",
