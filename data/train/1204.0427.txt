    "the radiation emitted by extragalactic radio sources ( ers ) at high radio frequencies , mainly synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in their jets and lobes , can be highly polarized , with an intrinsic degree of linear polarization as high as @xmath5 in homogeneous sources with an unidirectional magnetic field ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for comprehensive discussions on the subject ) .",
    "these have to be considered as maximum values , which could be detected only in the case of very homogeneous sources with highly aligned magnetic field lines , which are unlikely to be observed among ers .",
    "actually , a much lower degree of total linear polarization , @xmath6 , is commonly observed in ers at cm or mm wavelengths ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , with only very few ers showing a total fractional polarization , @xmath7 , as high as @xmath810% of the total flux density , @xmath9 .    nevertheless , this low fractional polarization observed in ers may constitute a problem for the detection of primordial polarization in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , since ers are the dominant polarized foreground at small angular scales and the cmb polarized signal is only a few percent of cmb temperature anisotropy .",
    "therefore , cmb polarization studies need a careful determination of the polarized emission from foreground sources in general and of ers in particular .",
    "cmb polarized anisotropies can be decomposed into modes of even - parity ( e - mode ) and odd - parity ( b - mode ) . as for the e - modes , generated by scalar perturbations in the primordial universe ,",
    "they were first detected by @xcite and all the following observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) have confirmed measurements of cmb e - modes compatible with the concordance @xmath10cdm model .",
    "the more elusive b - modes are generated by tensor metric perturbations , i.e. `` primordial '' gravitational waves generated during inflation , and , according to predictions of inflationary models , with an amplitude directly proportional to the energy scale at which the inflation occurred @xcite .",
    "a detection of these `` primordial '' b - modes would provide the first real measure of the energy scale of inflation : thus , it would produce a real breakthrough in modern cosmology .",
    "but the detection of the b - modes cmb polarization",
    " parameterized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath11  is still a great challenge .",
    "in fact , the _ planck _",
    "mission @xcite would be marginally able to detect tensor metric perturbations by the direct detection of the primordial cmb b - mode , but only in the case of very high values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio of primordial perturbations , @xmath12 @xcite . otherwise , we will have to rely on proposed future space experiments , like @xmath13 @xcite , specifically designed to detect cmb polarization by virtue of a much higher sensitivity than current ones .",
    "the above discussion clearly illustrates the importance of giving the best up - to - date estimate of the average / median fractional polarization as well as of the distributions of fractional polarization @xcite , @xmath14 , at least for each one of the different ers populations ( @xcite ) which are providing relevant contributions to temperature anisotropies of the cmb .",
    "statistical studies of polarized emission from ers have shown that at @xmath81.4 - 5 ghz , the fractional polarization , @xmath15 , increases with decreasing flux density @xcite .",
    "different explanations have been proposed of this result : e.g. , a population change at fainter flux density @xcite or a changing fraction of radio - quiet agn @xcite .",
    "however , the cause of this increase in @xmath15 is still unknown . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that this increase of the degree of polarization with decreasing flux density is only observed , at cm wavelengths , for steep  spectrum ers , i.e sources with @xmath16 if @xmath17 , and not for flat ",
    "spectrum ers ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "other very recent studies of the polarized emission in ers have tried to analyze the dependence of the fractional polarization with luminosity , redshift and the source environment .",
    "the current , still preliminary , results show no correlation between the fractional polarization and redshift , whereas a weak correlation is found between decreasing luminosity and increasing degree of polarization @xcite .",
    "according to the analysis of highly polarized elliptical galaxies @xcite no differences have been found in the source environments between low polarization and ultrahigh polarization sources .",
    "this result should indicate that a high polarization must be a result of intrinsic properties of ers .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sect.[s2 ] we briefly summarize the main processes giving rise to linear and circular polarization in ers ; in sect.[s3 ] we present current published data on the polarized emission from ers ; sect.[s4 ] is dedicated to discuss our current results on statistical properties of the polarized emission in ers ; in sect.[s6 ] we give a short review on the most recent cosmological evolution model for ers ; sect.[s7 ] presents our predictions on the contributions of ers polarized radiation , given by unresolved sources , to the e and b modes ; finally , in sect.[s8 ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "observations as well as statistical studies of the fractional polarization of ers are very interesting on their own , and not only because ers constitute a major contaminant of the cmb polarized signal .",
    "in fact , they are an important tool in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) research , as they give valuable information on the physical quantities which determine the characteristics of the synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons accelerated by homogeneous and/or random magnetic fields in agn @xcite",
    ".    on the one hand , precise measurements of the total synchrotron radiation emitted by a radio source give an estimate - under some assumption , i.e. equipartition between the field and particle energy - of the total magnetic field strength . on the other hand ,",
    "the degree of polarization of the radio wave provides information on the direction of the main magnetic field in the source environment and also on its degree of ordering .",
    "the magnetic field structure can , in turn , provide information on the relationship between the environments of the ers and their properties .",
    "as already noted , compact ers typically show a degree of total linear polarization of a few percent of their radio total intensity .",
    "therefore , magnetic fields in radio sources are believed to be highly inhomogeneous , or almost without ordering , although the observed non - vanishing linear polarization gives an indication of a certain degree of ordering of the field @xcite .",
    "the precise orientation of magnetic fields lines inside jets and lobes is still unknown , but theoretical arguments as well as observational evidence show that magnetic fields are indeed partially ordered . as for observations ,",
    "these conclusions are based on measurements of the orientations of the linear polarization , revealing coherent structures across the images . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", an ordered magnetic field is expected when shocks compress an initially random field ( with the field @xmath19 perpendicular to the jet axis ) or when such initial fields are sheared to lie in a plane , with @xmath20 parallel to the jet axis @xcite .",
    "circular polarization ( cp ) , which is a common feature of quasars and bllac objects ( or simply bllacs ) , commonly known as blazars , is preferentially generated near synchrotron self - absorbed jet cores and is detected in about 30%50% of these sources @xcite . in these inhomogeneous ,",
    "optically thick , synchrotron sources , the emission of the electron population at lower energies is hidden by self - absorption . these invisible electrons produce _ faraday rotation _ and conversion , which is the most likely mechanism capable of creating the observed cp in blazar sources @xcite . in any case , the measured degrees of cp are generally well below the levels of linear polarization @xcite , and thus negligible , at least at ghz frequencies .    the change in the position angle of the linearly polarized radiation which passes through a magneto - ionic medium , i.e. the _ faraday rotation _ , can be expressed by the rotation angle @xmath21[rad]=@xmath22[rad / m@xmath23@xmath24[m@xmath23 @xcite experienced by the polarization vector , where @xmath22 indicates the _ rotation measure_. the rotation measure , @xmath22 , is the line - of - sight integral @xmath22[rad / m@xmath23@xmath25[@xmath26@xmath27[@xmath28g]@xmath29[pc ] , @xmath30 being the electron density and @xmath27 the component of the magnetic field along the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "if the rotation depth is the same for all the emission volumes of the radio source , the net result is a rotation equal to @xmath31 of the direction of polarization , without any effect on the degree of polarization . to change the degree of polarization",
    "there must be a variation in depth , either along or transverse to the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "faraday rotation is commonly observed towards extragalactic radio sources .",
    "it was first observed by @xcite , who found an rm of @xmath32 rad / m@xmath33 towards the center of centaurus a. more recently , observations of the rest - frame rm in agn cores and jets reported values from a few hundreds to several thousands rad / m@xmath33 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "ers dominated by emission from radio lobes show lower values of rms , i.e .. from a few tens to hundreds of rad / m@xmath33 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a large  scale polarization catalogue of radio sources is provided by the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) at 1.4ghz @xcite .",
    "this survey covers @xmath34sr of the sky with @xmath35 .",
    "the catalogue contains the flux density @xmath9 and the stokes parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 of almost @xmath38 discrete sources with @xmath39mjy .",
    "extensive analyses of these data were carried out by @xcite and @xcite . by correlating nvss sources with sources from the green bank 4.85ghz ( gb6 ) catalogue @xcite , statistical polarization properties",
    "have been derived for a sub  sample of @xmath40 ers with @xmath41mjy , divided into steep and flat  spectrum sources .",
    "spectrum sources are found to increase the degree of polarization ( @xmath15 ) with decreasing flux density : in fact , the median ( mean ) @xmath15 value increases from @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for @xmath44mjy up to @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) for the faintest ers of the sample , at @xmath47mjy . on the other hand ,",
    "flat  spectrum sources show a lower fractional polarization ( median @xmath48 and mean @xmath43 ) with no significant trend with flux density @xcite .    two recent sub ",
    "mjy surveys at 1.4ghz with polarization measurements , i.e. the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) _ planck _ deep fields project @xcite and the australia telescope low  brightness survey ( atlbs ) @xcite , seem to confirm the above result of a higher level of fractional polarization in steep  spectrum sources with fainter flux densities .",
    "however , there is not a clear explanation for the origin of the anticorrelation between @xmath15 and flux density in this source population .    in fig.[f1 ]",
    "we plot differential number counts at 1.4ghz for the polarized intensity , computed from the surveys presented above .",
    "the continuous curve represents a fit to total number counts of agns from @xcite , whereas the dotted curve is obtained from the previous fit by assuming a constant fractional polarization of @xmath49% for _ all _ ers .",
    "this value is chosen in order to fit nvss data ; the fit is extremely good down to polarized intensities of @xmath50mjy . at fainter @xmath6 fluxes",
    "the predicted curve bends down whereas observational data keep a flatter shape , in agreement with a higher fractional polarization for ers at fainter flux density levels .",
    "polarization measurements of sources in the b3vla survey @xcite were carried out by @xcite at 10.5 , 4.85 and 2.7ghz using the effelsberg 100m telescope .",
    "taking into account only sources with @xmath51mjy , a sample of 106 objects ( out of 208 ) were defined with detected polarization .",
    "they found that flat ",
    "spectrum sources are significantly less polarized than steep",
    " spectrum ones at 10.5ghz .",
    "the latter ers population shows a median fractional polarization that strongly depends on the frequency , from @xmath52 at 1.4ghz to @xmath53 at 10.5ghz , indicating a high faraday depolarization at lower frequencies .",
    "moreover , they notice that compact steep ",
    "spectrum sources exhibit much stronger depolarization than non  compact ones , and that sources showing larger linear size are more polarized . on the other hand , flat",
    " spectrum sources are characterized by almost constant and low degrees of polarization ( @xmath54 ) over the whole wavelength range considered .",
    "the at20 g survey is a blind survey of the whole southern sky at 20ghz with follow  up observations at 4.8 and 8.6ghz carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) @xcite .",
    "the full source catalogue includes 5890 sources detected above a flux  density limit of 40mjy .",
    "the at20 g catalogue is found to be 91% complete above 100mjy and 79% above 50mjy in regions south of declination @xmath55 .",
    "polarization was detected at 20ghz for 768 sources , 467 of which also have simultaneous polarization detections at 5 and/or 8ghz ( upper limits on the polarized flux density are provided for non  detections , as described in @xcite ) . taking into account upper limits , a median ( mean ) fractional polarization of 2.6% ( 2.7% ) at 20ghz",
    "is found for sources with @xmath56mjy , whereas an average 17% depolarization is observed at 5ghz with respect to 20ghz @xcite .",
    "compact sources with detected polarization are separated into flat and steep  spectrum sources : the mean values of @xmath15 are 2.9% and 3.8% respectively , thus confirming the higher fractional polarization in steep  spectrum sources .      using the vla ,",
    "@xcite carried out polarization measurements at 8.4 , 22 and 43ghz of a complete sample of ers brighter than 1jy in the 5year wmap catalogue and with declinations north of @xmath57 .",
    "the sample consists of 203 objects : polarized emission was detected for 123 , 169 and 167 sources at 8.4 , 22 and 43ghz respectively ( at 8.4ghz only a subset of 134 were observed ) and 105 were detected at all the 3 frequencies .",
    "an accurate analysis of the statistical properties of the polarized intensity of the sample is done by @xcite , including an analysis of the correlations between the fractional polarization and the spectral indices .",
    "here below , we summarize the main results obtained by them :    * the distribution of the fractional polarization varies slightly as a function of the frequency . including sources undetected in polarization , the mean fractional polarization is @xmath58 3.0 and 3.5 percent at 8.4 , 22 and 43ghz .",
    "* no correlation is found between the fractional polarization at 22ghz and the intensity spectral indices , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( we remind readers that the sample , selected at 22ghz , is dominated by flat ",
    "spectrum sources ) .",
    "* there is a significant change in the polarization angle between 8.4 and 22ghz . for 45 sources ,",
    "the position angle satisfies the @xmath61 dependence , and intrinsic rotation measures in excess of 1000radm@xmath62 were observed for a large number of them .",
    "* polarization of 71 sources were also measured at 86ghz by @xcite .",
    "the fractional polarization is typically higher at 86ghz than at 43ghz .      in @xcite ,",
    "vla observations in total intensity and polarization at 4.86 , 8.46 , 22.46 and 43.34ghz are presented .",
    "the sample is selected from the at20 g survey and consists of 159 ers , out of the almost 200 sources with flux density @xmath63mjy in a field of the atacama comsmology telescope ( act ) survey .",
    "polarized emission for about 60 sources was detected at all 4 frequencies , whereas the detections are 141 , 146 , 89 and 59 from low to high frequencies .",
    "fractional polarization distributions are very similar at 5 and 8.5ghz , whereas a trend of increasing polarization with increasing frequency is indicated at 22 and 43ghz .",
    "in particular , a tail of strongly polarized ( @xmath64 ) sources is observed at 43ghz .",
    "data at 22 and 43ghz suggest also that the polarization fraction in steep ",
    "spectrum sources is significant higher than in flat  spectrum sources .",
    "* @xcite presented polarization observations of 250 ( out of 258 ) southern sources in the complete 5ghz 1jy sample of @xcite by using the atca facilities at 18.5ghz .",
    "polarized flux densities were measured for 170 sources ( 114 flat  spectrum and 56 steep  spectrum ) , upper limits were set for an additional subset of 27 sources ( 12 flat  spectrum and 15 steep  spectrum ) , and 53 sources were rejected ( probably extended objects ) . the final flat  spectrum sample is almost complete ( 80% ) , while only 49% of steep  spectrum sources have reliable detections . in the flat  spectrum sample",
    "the median fractional polarization is @xmath46 and the mean @xmath65 , and no sources have @xmath66 . the median fractional polarization for the flat ",
    "spectrum sources included in the nvss catalogue is about a factor 2 lower than that at 18.5ghz . however , a relevant increase in the polarization fraction at 18.5ghz is noticed only for sources with @xmath67 at 1.4ghz .",
    "* @xcite presented a 3.5 mm polarimetric survey of ers using the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "their sample consists of 145 flat ",
    "spectrum sources with @xmath68 and flux density @xmath69jy at 86ghz .",
    "linear polarization is detected for 76% of the sample ( 110 objects ) .",
    "they found that bllacs ( @xmath70 ) are more strongly polarized than quasars ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "this result seems to be in contradiction with the idea that quasars should be more polarized at high frequencies than bllacs because in the latter sources the synchrotron self  absorbed spectrum is mantained up to higher frequencies .",
    "a possible explaination provided by the authors comes from the recent evidence that the view angle of jets in quasars is smaller than that in bllacs @xcite .",
    "so , if the magnetic field is not homogeneous along the jet , a lower fractional polarization level is expected from sources better oriented to the line of sight ( i.e. , quasars ) .",
    "+ moreover , for those sources with detected polarization at 15ghz , they found that @xmath72 is larger than @xmath73 by a median factor @xmath74 , and about 20% of sources have the @xmath75 ratio larger than 4 .",
    "@xcite suggest that this increase may be explained by a combination of two phenomena : the 86ghz emission comes from a region with greater degree of order in the magnetic field ; or / and , at 15ghz , emission is still affected by faraday depolarization .",
    "* @xcite looked for polarized sources in the _ wmap _ five  year data , using a new technique named _ filtered fusion_. they detected polarization in 13 ers at a confindence level @xmath76 and polarized flux density higher than 300mjy .",
    "in order to provide reliable estimates of ers contamination to cmb anisotropy polarization measurements , we need to address the following main questions about polarization properties of ers : 1 ) how the fractional polarization , @xmath15 , varies from cm to mm wavelengths ; 2 ) _ if _ the fractional polarization depends on the flux density ; 3 ) how polarization properties change among the different populations of ers . in this section",
    "we address these questions on the basis of the observational data presented and discussed in the previous section .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t1 ]    we investigate more deeply the polarization of ers observed in the at20 g survey .",
    "we consider the almost  complete sample at @xmath77 and , when available , we use 5 and 8ghz measurements to separate ers into steep and flat  spectrum sources . in table[t1 ]",
    "we report statistical properties of the fractional polarization ( i.e. , the mean @xmath78 , the median @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) for flat  spectrum sources as a function of the flux density range and the frequency .",
    "they are computed using the survival analysis techniques and the kaplan ",
    "meyer estimator as implemented in the asurv code @xcite , which takes into account upper limits on the fractional polarization for estimating the above quoted quantities .",
    "in fact , when polarization is not detected , an upper limit is provided .",
    "about 10% of sources in the at20 g sample we use here have measurements only at 20ghz ( see table[t1 ] ) . although most of them should be flat  spectrum sources , for a more consistent comparison with results at 5 and 8ghz we prefer to exclude them from the analysis .    at 20ghz the median and the mean fractional polarization do not present any significant variation between the subsamples defined by @xmath81jy and @xmath82jy . at the lower frequencies , @xmath78 and @xmath79 show a moderate decrease at fainter flux densities .",
    "in particular , two  sample tests implemented in the asurv code ( e.g. , the gehan s generalized wilcoxon test and the peto&prentice generalized wilcoxon test ) yield a probability of @xmath83 and @xmath84 that the distributions of the fractional polarization for @xmath81jy and @xmath82jy at 5 and 8ghz respectively are drawn from the same parent distribution ( compared to a probability of 30% at 20ghz ) . at flux densities lower than 500mjy , the high number of upper limits ( @xmath85% ) makes our estimates unreliable .    on the other hand ,",
    "a larger fractional polarization is observed as the frequency increases , with , on average , @xmath8618% of depolarization at 5ghz with respect to 20ghz , in agreement with results from @xcite .",
    "the asurv two  sample tests yield only a 10% probability to have the same parent distribution for @xmath15 at 5 and 20ghz . for a better comparison ,",
    "we show in fig.[f2a ] the distributions of the fractional polarization discussed above as obtained by using the kaplan  meyer estimator .",
    "these distributions are well fitted by a log  normal distribution with @xmath79 and @xmath87 values taken from table[t1 ] ( see , e.g. , the case at 20ghz in fig.[f2a ] ) .",
    "clearly shows that the log - normal distribution , when averaged in each @xmath15 bin , is giving predictions always compatible with the observed @xmath15 values well inside the 1@xmath88 level , except for very few bins at high @xmath15 levels where the statistics is very poor .",
    "we have also verified that adopting other distribution functions , e.g. a truncated gaussian , we are not able to reproduce equally well the observed distributions of @xmath15 . ]    in fig.[f2 ] we also study the correlation of @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 : no clear correlation is found between the fractional polarization and the flux density at 20ghz ( the generalized kendall s tau test yields a probability @xmath92 of no correlation ) . on the other hand , as expected , we see a strong correlation between the fractional polarization at 20 and 4.8ghz ( with a @xmath93 of no correlation ) . using the schmitt s method from the asurv code , we find a linear regression @xmath94 .",
    "this result seems to indicate that only sources with very low fractional polarization at 5ghz ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) have a significant increase of @xmath15 at 20ghz ( see also fig.[f2 ] ) . the large offset term in the linear regression we find , however , could be also partially due to eddington bias in the at20 g catalogue and to the large number of sources with upper limits in fractional polarization at @xmath96% .             in fig.[f4 ]",
    "we plot the mean and median values of the fractional polarization as obtained from the surveys presented in the previous section .",
    "these data allow us to cover frequencies from 1.4 to 86ghz .",
    "although there is large scatter in the data , we see a general increasing trend for the median fractional polarization : @xmath79 is @xmath97 at 1.4ghz , around 22.5% in the range 510ghz , and finally 2@xmath98 at @xmath99 .",
    "the mean fractional polarization has a more linear increase with the frequency in all the samples , with @xmath78 varying from 22.5% at 1.4ghz to 3@xmath100 at @xmath101ghz .",
    "most of the data presented in fig.[f4 ] are coming from samples of bright sources , typically with @xmath102jy .",
    "samples with fainter sources are the b3vla ( @xmath103mjy ) and the sample discussed in @xcite .",
    "the latter one provides polarization for sources with @xmath104mjy .",
    "however , since at the frequencies 20 and 43ghz the number of polarized ers detected in the sample is less than 50percent , we have decided to consider only flat  spectrum sources with @xmath105mjy .",
    "spectral indices are estimated using flux densities at 4.86 and 8.46ghz .",
    "table[t2 ] reports the number of detections and the corresponding values of the mean , median and @xmath80 of the fractional polarization .",
    "for the two highest frequencies of the sample we estimate the median in two ways : firstly , we use the asurv code , by taking into account the upper limits ; secondly , we assume a fractional polarization @xmath106% for those sources without measured polarization ( values indicated in brackets in table[t2 ] ) .",
    "the large spread between the two values at 43ghz is an indication that the sample , also including upper limits , could provide biased values of statistical properties of @xmath15 at these frequencies .",
    "if we compare results from the previous two samples ( i.e. , b3vla and @xcite ) with surveys of bright sources , we can not find any clear evidence of higher fractional polarization in faint sources .",
    "however , larger and deeper samples of data are clearly required to settle the question .    in fig.[f4 ]",

    "nevertheless , from fig.[f3 ] we can see a general increase of the fractional polarization between 4.8 and 20ghz : the ratio of @xmath15 at 20 and 4.8ghz is typically close to one ( @xmath116 ) for sources with @xmath117 , but become higher for sources weakly polarized at 4.8ghz .",

    "this steepening has been already observed in blazars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and has also been statistically suggested by recent analyses of different ers samples at @xmath145ghz @xcite .",
    "a first attempt of taking such steepening in blazar spectra into account has been done by @xcite . in this work the spectral behaviour of blazars at mm wavelengths",

    "recent high frequency data @xcite , and in particular the first 1.6 _ planck _ survey @xcite have provided new important results on number counts and related statistics of ers , and they can be used to constrain the different possible cases / models featuring a spectral break in the emission of agn jets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the most successful one ( indicated in @xcite as c2ex , i.e. the relevant emission is emitted from a more `` extended '' region in the inner jet of fsrqs ) assumes different distributions of the break frequency for bllacs and fsrqs . according to this model",
    ", most of the fsrqs should show a bend in their otherwise flat spectra between 10 and 100ghz , whereas in bllac spectral breaks should be typically observed at @xmath147ghz ( implying that the observed synchrotron radiation comes from more compact emitting regions ) .",
    "this dichotomy has been indeed found in the _ planck _ ercsc @xcite : almost all radio sources show very flat spectral indices at lfi frequencies , @xmath148 ; at hfi frequencies bllacs keep flat spectra ( @xmath149 ) while most of fsrqs show steeper spectra , i.e. @xmath150 .",

    "this question involves the determination of source counts in polarization .",
    "this estimate is quite difficult to perform directly , by the statistical analysis of observational data , since the polarized signal is weak and many samples are usually defined by their completeness in terms only of total intensity . however",
    ", this problem can be overcome by using the source number counts in total intensity complemented by information on the statistical properties of the fractional polarization @xmath15 , expressed in term of some probability function @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "let us discuss this point in more detail .",
    "polarization number counts @xmath120 can be written as : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the total number of sources with @xmath156 in the sample , @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the probability functions of observing in a source of flux density @xmath9 a polarized intensity @xmath6 and a fractional polarization @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "a critical point for our estimates is the variation with frequency of the fractional polarization observed in ers .",
    "the data on ers polarization discussed in this paper clearly show an higher fractional polarization at 1020ghz than at few ghz in both flat and , more prominently , in steep  spectrum sources . at higher frequencies ,",
    "data become scarce , but there are still indication of a possible further increase of the polarization fraction from 1020ghz to 4090ghz @xcite . for flat ",
    "spectrum sources , this increase could be due to the combination of two different effects : 1 ) the polarization degree actually increases with the frequency ; and 2 ) bllacs , which are observed to be more polarized than quasars @xcite , become more relevant in number at higher frequencies .    in the following predictions",
    "we take into account both effects .",
    "we consider two possible values for the median and the dispersion @xmath164 of the log  normal distribution in order to provide a range of estimates for number counts and power spectra that could take into account uncertainties in observational data at @xmath165ghz .",
    "table[t4 ] reports our estimates for a more `` optimistic '' ( lower ) and a more `` conservative '' ( upper ) case . the frequency dependence of the fractional polarization in ers is simply modeled by means of two different sets of median and r.m.s .",
    "values at frequencies below and above about 40ghz .",
    "although somewhat arbitrary , this choice is motivated by the fact that this is the highest frequency at which multi - frequency polarization samples of ers are available .",
    "* at @xmath166ghz we choose a lower and higher median and r.m.s .",
    "values of the fractional polarization based on the results displayed in fig.[f4 ] .",
    "moreover , we require that number counts computed using values in table[t4 ] be ( at least partially ) compatible with at20g / wmap counts in polarization . as shown in fig.[f5 ] , the more `` optimistic '' case fits quite well observational counts , especially at @xmath167mjy . on the other hand , the more `` conservative '' case tends to overestimate number counts at lower polarized fluxes , whereas it fits particularly well current data at high @xmath6 fluxes .",
    "this is not unexpected because , in this latter case , we take as median and dispersion of the fractional polarization for blazars the values provided by @xcite at 90ghz .",
    "* at @xmath168ghz , we make the assumption of an increase of the median fractional polarization of about 20% with respect to the corresponding cases at @xmath16940ghz .",
    "this choice is not firmly constrained by current data sets ; however , we have been guided by the fractional polarization levels of ers observed by @xcite at 86 ghz which fall in the middle between our present lower and upper cases .",

    "in this contribution we have reviewed recently available polarimetric surveys of extragalactic radio sources at frequencies @xmath0ghz .",
    "these data point out that the typical intrinsic fractional polarization of ers is around 25% of the total flux density , @xmath9 , of the source even at frequencies as high as 20ghz , and that in very few objects the fractional polarization is @xmath202",
    ". this may be due to the low degree of uniformity of magnetic fields in the internal part of agn jets and in lobes .",
    "faraday depolarization is probably the cause of the large number of sources with a very low level of polarization , i.e. @xmath67 , at ghz frequencies , which also explains the strong increase of the fractional polarization observed at @xmath203ghz in those objects .",
    "this conclusion is supported by high or extreme values of rotation measure rm@xmath204radm@xmath62 observed in some blazars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "however , because of incompleteness of the samples and of the small number of steep  spectrum sources in surveys at @xmath205ghz , current observations could be biased by high  polarized objects .    in general",

    "density ranges covered by available surveys , flat  spectrum sources are dominated by quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "these objects are typically less polarized than bllacs @xcite , which become increasingly relevant at fainter flux densities and become the dominant population at @xmath206mjy @xcite .",
    "we also discuss a formalism to estimate ers number counts in polarization and to predict the contribution of unresolved ers to angular power spectra at cmb frequencies . as a first application , we attempt to predict how many polarized ers the _ planck _ satellite will be able to detect in the different channels sensible to polarization measurements",

    "lfi , and a few tens at the hfi frequencies .",
    "although the number of _ planck _ detected sources is low , these data will allow us to study the frequency dependence of the fractional polarization in a wide range of frequencies , from 30 to 353ghz , thus providing original and valuable information on polarization properties of ers in the innermost regions of agn jets .    finally",
    ", our results on polarization power spectra demonstrate that ers should not be a strong contaminant to the cmb e  mode polarization when observing at frequencies @xmath3ghz .",
    "moreover , it seems unlikely that ers will have a significant impact on our ability to detect the b  mode polarization from primordial graviational waves if @xmath207 . on the contrary , if the cosmological b  mode signal is fainter , some strategy will be required to subtract the confusion noise produced by radio sources with flux ",
