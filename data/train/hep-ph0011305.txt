    "the tauola package @xcite for the simulation of @xmath0 lepton decays and photos @xcite for the simulation of radiative corrections in decay , are computing projects with a rather long history . written and maintained by well defined authors , they nonetheless migrated into a wide range of applications where they became ingredients of complicated simulation chains . as a consequence , a large number of different versions are presently in use . from the algorithmic point of view",
    ", they often differ only in a few small details , but incorporate a substantial amount of specific results from the distinct @xmath0-lepton measurements .",
    "such versions were mainly maintained ( and will remain so maintained ) by the experiments taking precision data on @xmath0 leptons . on the other hand , many new applications were developed recently , often requiring program versions which differ because of interfaces to other packages ( eg . the format of the event record had to be adjusted , the organization of the input parameters changed , etc . ) .    in the last two years , substantial progress for the simulation of @xmath0-pair production was achieved .",
    "control of the systematic errors , for the theoretical predictions , at the few permille level was achieved ( or , for some centre - fo - mass system energies , is relatively easy to achieve in the near future ) for the centre of mass energy from the @xmath0-pair production threshold up to the energies of the future linear colliders .",
    "in ref . @xcite the setup for constructing specific versions of tauola and photos from the single set of files was prepared and documented .",
    "the system was prepared for the software librarians and advanced users interested in updating the packages for the multipurpose environment .",
    "the idea was to create a repository which allows one to keep all main options of tauola developed for different purposes in a relatively compact form , without duplications of semi - identical parts .",
    "the repository was set to produce the standard fortran files which can be later handled , exactly the same way , as the published versions of the packages .",
    "3 mm * motivations for versioning * :    1 .   photos : versions of the fortran code are necessary because of the different versions of the hepevt common block being in use in the hep libraries ( single / double precision , dimensionality of storage matrices ) .",
    "tauola : versions of the fortran code are motivated by : ( a ) different versions of initialization of physics parameters ; ( b ) interfaces to different monte carlo generators for production of @xmath0-lepton(s ) ; and ( c ) different versions of the hepevt common block : * \\(a ) different physics initializations : + ( 1 ) as published in @xcite ; + ( 2 ) as initialized by the aleph collaboration @xcite ( it is suggested to use this version only with the help of the collaboration s advice ) ; + ( 3 ) as initialized by the cleo collaboration @xcite ( see the printout of this version for details ) ; + ( 4 ) further coding of some individual decay modes . *",
    "\\(b ) different interfaces with mc generators : + ( 1 ) old demo program as in the published version @xcite ; + ( 2 ) interface to kkmc @xcite ; + ( 3 ) new universal interface using hepevt common block . *",
    "\\(c ) different versions of the hepevt common block .",
    "tauola and photos : different versions of random number generators .",
    "tauola and photos : makefiles with different compiler flags .",
    "standard tools are used in the discussed setup : cpp the c - language pre - compiler : its if , elif and include commands , as well as unix logical links and cat command .",
    "the aim is to provide full backward compatibility at the level of the fortran source with the published versions , or other versions being in use at present .",
    "it is expected that one will use the setup to create her / his version of the tauola and photos libraries and interfaces ( subdirectories tauola/ and photos/ ) consisting of the plain fortran code .",
    "the original subdirectories of the setup can then be erased or stored for future use .",
    "* the following directories are created *    * once the actions of the setup are completed : *    1 .   photos/ : standard directory with the fortran code of the photos library and its demo .",
    "tauola/ : standard directory with the fortran code of the tauola library , its demos and example outputs . 1 .",
    "tauola / demo - standalone : demo program for tauola executed in a standalone mode .",
    "tauola / demo - jetset : demo program for tauola executed with universal interface to physics event generators based on the hepevt common block . in this demo hepevt",
    "is filled from the jetset74 @xcite monte carlo generator .",
    "tauola / demo - kk - face : interface to the kk monte carlo @xcite .",
    "the different options of photos which can be created correspond solely to the different versions of the hepevt common block .",
    "the possible options are :    1 .",
    "kk - all  for kk monte carlo 2 .",
    "2kd - all  dimension 2000 double precision 3 .",
    "4kd - all  dimension 4000 double precision 4 .   2kr - all  dimension 2000 single precision 5 .",
    "10kd - all  dimension 10000 double precision      basic options for the physics initializations , activated with the single command make , are : cpc ; cleo ; aleph .",
    "the three possible versions of the created tauola directory correspond to form - factors and branching ratios defined respectively as in : ( cpc ) the published version of tauola ; ( aleph ) the conventions as adopted by the aleph collaboration , ( cleo ) the conventions as adopted by the cleo collaboration .",
    "@xmath2 additional parametrizations for form - factors , which can be useful in some applications , are placed in the separate directory . at present , the code used in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite is stored there .",
    "@xmath2 it is often necessary to change some of the tauola input parameters like branching ratios , the mass of the @xmath0-lepton , etc .",
    "it is convenient to have it done once for all applications i.e. demo - kk - face , demo - jetset and demo - standalone .",
    "the special arrangements to do it , in a consistent way , are provided . for details of the initialization routines , which are semi - identical in the three cases ,",
    "@xcite . note that special care from the physics point of view is needed .",
    "often , input parameters are inter - related with the actual choice of form factors .",
    "the changes should be thus performed simultaneously .",
    "the universal interface of tauola for `` any '' @xmath0 production generator is provided .",
    "it uses as an input , the hepevt common block and operates on its content only . as a demonstration example",
    "the interface is combined with the jetset generator , however it should work in the same manner with the pythia , herwig or isajet generators as well .",
    "the interface work in the following way :    * the @xmath0-lepton should be forced to be stable in the @xmath0 production generator . * the content of the hepevt common block is searched for all @xmath0 leptons and neutrinos first . *",
    "it is checked if there are @xmath0-flavour pairs ( two @xmath0-leptons or @xmath0-lepton and @xmath0-neutrino ) originating from the same mother . *",
    "the decays of the @xmath0-flavour pairs are performed with tauola .",
    "longitudinal spin effects are generated in the case of the @xmath0 produced from decay of : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the neutral higgs boson @xmath5 , and the charged higgs boson @xmath6 .",
    "parallel or anti - parallel spin configurations are generated , before calling on the @xmath0 decay , and then the decays of 100 % polarized @xmath0 s are executed . * in the case of the higgs boson ( for the spin correlations to be generated ) the identifier of the @xmath0 mother must be that of the higgs . * in case of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 it is not necessary .",
    "if from the same mother as that of the @xmath0 there is produced also a @xmath9 , the @xmath7 is reconstructed by the interface as the sum of the two .",
    "simmilarily , @xmath8 is reconstructed if from the same mother another @xmath0 is produced . *",
    "let us note that the calculation of the @xmath0 polarization created from the @xmath10 and/or virtual @xmath11 ( as function of the direction ) represents a rather non - trivial extension .",
    "dedicated study of the production matrix elements of the host generator is necessary .",
    "a separate paper @xcite is devoted to this point ; let us show however some preliminary results in the next section .",
    "at this moment the distribution version of the package , available from the www - page , does not include this possibility .",
    "the updated version can be obtained from the authors upon individual requests only .",
    "* photon radiation in decay is performed with photos .",
    "the best way of calculating spin state of any final state is with the help of the matrix element and the rigorous density matrix treatment .",
    "this is however not always possible or necessary .",
    "often , like in the case of the production and decay of particles in the ultra - relativistic limit a simplified approach can be sufficient .",
    "such an approach was developed for koralz monte carlo program @xcite and its limitations were studied with the help of matrix element calculations of order @xmath12 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we study the question of whether a similar approach can not be generalized , and the approximate spin correlation calculated from the information stored in the hepevt common block by the typical @xmath0 production program :    the approximation consists of calculating / approximating variables and later using the spin correlation of the elementary @xmath13 body process @xmath14 , buried inside multi - body production process .",
    "let us stress that such a procedure can never be fully controlled as its uncertainties and even functioning depends on the way the particular production program fills the hepevt common block .",
    "it will be always responsibility of the user to check if in the particular case the approximation can be useful .",
    "nonetheless our aim is _ not _ to replace the matrix element calculations , but rather to provide a method of calculating / estimating spin effects in cases when otherwise spin effects would not be taken care of , at all .",
    "needless to say such an approach is limited for the spin treatment to the approximation not better than the leading - log .",
    "the principle of calculating kinematical variables is simple .",
    "the 4-momenta of the @xmath13 body process have to be found .",
    "the 4-momenta of the outcoming @xmath0 s are used directly .",
    "initial state momenta are constructed from the incoming and outcoming momenta of the particles ( or fields ) accompanying production of the @xmath8 state state does not need to be explicitly coded in the hepevt common block .",
    "note that if available , information from the history part of the event , where the 4-momenta of gluons quarks etc .",
    "are stored , will be used . ] .",
    "we group them accordingly to fermion number flow , and ambiguous additional particles are grouped ( summed ) into effective quarks to minimize their virtualities .",
    "such an approach is consistent in the case of emission of photons or gluons with the leading log approximation .    in the following ,",
    "let us give a few examples of tests we have performed so far on the elements of the calculation , see ref @xcite for more details . in fig .",
    "1 we plot the @xmath0 polarization in @xmath13 body scattering as a function of the scattering angle respectively for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 initial states . in fig .",
    "2 we use the most spin sensitive decay mode @xmath18 and we show the @xmath19 energy spectrum ( in the @xmath10 rest - frame ) , and energy - energy correlations between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( also in the @xmath10 rest - frame ) . due to the @xmath10 interaction the @xmath0 leptons",
    "are polarized ; there is thus a shift toward lower energies in the @xmath19 energy spectrum . from the second part of the plot",
    ", we see that the configurations where both @xmath20 and @xmath21 have energies bigger or smaller than average are more populous than the mixed configurations , exhibiting the vector nature of the @xmath22 vertex . on the contrary , in the case of the production from the higgs meson ,",
    "the opposite would be true , and the mixed fast - slow ( slow - fast ) configurations would be more common , the energy spectrum of the @xmath19 would be flat .",

    "until 1999 the two widely used programs for the @xmath0-pair production in @xmath1 collisions were koralb @xcite and koralz @xcite .",
    "the first of the two programs was used mainly at lower energies where its full treatment of spin and @xmath0-mass effects was more important than its limited , first - order only , treatment of radiative corrections .",
    "koralz was more appropriate for the higher energy zone , especially on the peak of the @xmath10 resonance , where the ultra - relativistic approximation of the spin effects was sufficient , effects of the higher order qed corrections were important , and , thanks to the @xmath10 life - time , the interference of initial and final state bremsstrahlung was strongly suppressed .",
    "this second assumption turned out not to withstand the numerical requirements of the lep2 physics see eg . @xcite .",
    "also , it is not enough for requirements of the future high energy linear colliders requirements such as tesla @xcite .    in the recent years , a new monte carlo program , based on exponentiation performed at the spin amplitude level , was developed @xcite .",
    "thanks to the applied technique , it can provide predictions at the precision level of a few permille , for centre - of - mass energies from @xmath0 production threshold up to the energies of the linear collider range .",
    "so far , precision tests were performed for the centre - of - mass energies corresponding to lep2 . for other energies , points such as matching virtual pair corrections with simulations of 4-fermion final states @xcite , photonic vacuum polarization effects at low energies , coulomb interactions , mass terms in some virtual corrections , etc .",

    "the status of the programs for the production of @xmath0 leptons was reviewed .",
    "the high precision monte carlo program kkmc for @xmath0-pair production in @xmath1 collisions was presented .",
    "the general purpose interface , with the partial treatment of spin effects , of tauola to any production program was also reviewed . at present , in its full content , it is available from the authors upon individual request only .",
    "distinct versions of the tauola library for @xmath0 lepton decay , and of photos for radiative corrections in decays , are now in use . the versions differ either due to physics initialization or requirements of the interfaces . we have presented the system for creating the required version of the photos and tauola packages from the single master copies .",
    "the master copies are kept in relatively compact and clear form , without code duplications and with the help of the cpp pre - compiler .",
    "we expect that this organization , on top of the practical goals of the every day applications , may serve also as a step to develop the packages ( without loss of their physics content ) into new internal architectures .",
    "some additional experience was collected in @xcite in context of oo c++ .",
    "we have found that the language translation for the given program version is relatively easy . on the contrary",
    ", the question of project continuity into further upgrades motivated by the physics needs to be thought over carefully .",
    "matching the programming styles , e.g. of the oo c++ experts , with the strategies of testing the numerical correctness of consecutive versions is a rather crucial issue which has to be addressed .",
    "tools and methods embodied in fortran survive such translations with difficulty .",
    "the successful strategy will probably require simultaneous fluency , at a certain step of the project development , in fortran , oo languages _ and _ the physics content of the project , by all involved persons .",
    "platform independent tools for mixing code in fortran and oo languages will be of great help .",
