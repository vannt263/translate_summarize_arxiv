    "ratchets , brownian motors or rectifiers are nonequilibrium systems that rectify fluctuations in the medium to achieve directed motion  @xcite . the main criteria for these systems are spatially extended periodic structures and unbiased external fluctuations that drive the system out of equilibrium .",

    "only when the system is driven out of equilibrium , this principle no longer holds and the brownian particles can achieve directed motion by rectification of thermal fluctuations .",
    "these _ ratchet models _ are found to have wide ranging applications in physical and biological systems  @xcite .",
    "considerable amount of work has been devoted to understand the nature of currents and their reversals in different classes of ratchet models ( namely flashing ratchets  @xcite , rocking ratchets  @xcite , frictional ratchets  @xcite , etc ) .",
    "moreover , these ratchets or motors are engines at the molecular scale converting input energy from a nonequilibrium environment into useful work .",

    ", another important property of these systems is being explored , namely the reliability or coherence of transport .",
    "the unidirectional current of brownian particles in stochastic ratchets , however , is always accompanied by a diffusive spread ( dispersion ) . this spread is intimately related to the question of reliability or quality of transport to the extent that it may completely overshadow the ratcheting effect in a system with finite spatial extensions . for example , if a particle on an average moves a distance @xmath0 due to it s finite average velocity , @xmath1 , there will always be an accompanying diffusive spread .",
    "if this spread is much smaller than the distance traveled , then the motion of the particle is considered as coherent or reliable .",
    "this , in turn , can be quantified in terms of a dimensionless number called the pclet number(@xmath2 ) , which is the ratio of the average velocity , @xmath1 , to the diffusion constant , @xmath3 .",
    "more specifically @xmath4 . in our studies , we take @xmath0 to be the length of the period of the relevant spatially periodic potential .",
    "quantitatively , if @xmath5 , the transport is said to be coherent , otherwise it is incoherent or unreliable .",
    "there exist very few studies , which address the question of reliability of transport .",
    "@xmath2 for some models of flashing and rocking ratchets were found to be @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively  @xcite , implying a less reliable transport .",
    "a study on symmetric periodic potentials along with a spatially modulated white noise showed a coherent transport with @xmath2 less than @xmath8 . in the same study a special kind of strongly asymmetric potential",
    "was found to increase @xmath2 to @xmath9 in some range of physical parameters  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies in biological motors show them to exhibit highly efficient and reliable transport with @xmath2 ranging from 2 to 6  @xcite . in a very recent work ,",
    "the collective effects of coupled brownian motors were found to show high transport coherence  @xcite .",
    "reliability of transport has also been studied in frictional ratchets and coherent transport is observed in a part of the parameter space  @xcite .    in the present work , we study the transport coherence in two different classes of rocking ratchets . in the first case ( hereafter referred to as _ case 1 _ ) ,",

    "our work on transport coherence is relevant to the aforementioned experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "one can readily perform measurements of transport coherence in experimental set - ups akin to ref .",
    "we show throughout this work that that these ratchets exhibit a _ generic effect _ in the deterministic limit(absence of noise or temperature ) : if the ratchet exhibits a finite current , one observes giant coherence at low temperatures while if the current vanishes , the associated transport coherence is very low .",
    "moreover , this enhanced coherence is maintained as long as currents in the backward direction are suppressed .",
    "the suppression of backward currents also leads to an enhanced thermodynamic efficiency of energy transduction  @xcite in absence of which the thermodynamic efficiency in ratchet systems is very low  @xcite .",

    "the coherence in transport reduces as a function of temperature and is a non - monotonic function of the amplitude of driving .",
    "in general , the ratchet systems which favour currents in the forward direction and suppresses currents in the backward direction are expected to show enhanced coherence , other examples being flashing ratchets where two periodic states are displaced with respect to each other  @xcite .",
    "the ratchet systems at finite driving frequencies studied in this work exhibit several complex features in the nature of current and diffusion coefficient in the deterministic limit .",
    "current exhibits quantisation ( plateaus ) associated with phase or frequency locking behaviour as a function of the amplitude of the driving force and other parameters  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , diffusion exhibits giant peaks and crests in presence of small noise .",
    "these curves develop oscillatory features ( namely resonances and antiresonances ) in the presence of small noise ( multiple peaks in diffusion and currents can be observed ) .",
    "these intriguing features can be attributed to the complex dynamics of the particle which arises due to the combined effects between non - linearity , frequency of driving and noise  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these complex features are not robust in the presence of finite noise , the subject matter of which is under study vis - a - vis the coherence in transport . + * acknowledgement * + one of the authors(amj ) thanks m.c .",
