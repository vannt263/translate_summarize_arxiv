    "in this section we summarize the experimental results from the heavy flavour working group @xcite .",
    "the presentations covered a wide range of topics , from charm , beauty and charmonium production in @xmath8 and @xmath9 collisions , heavy ion results on charm suppression , spectroscopy and rare decays , over oscillations in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems to the outlook for heavy flavour physics at future experiments at the lhc and the ilc .",
    "charm production in @xmath8 collisions has been studied extensively over the last years at hera , and a wealth of data exist in photoproduction ( where the exchanged photon is quasi - real , with a virtuality @xmath10 ) and deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "the hera collider experiments , h1 and zeus , have presented new preliminary results on charm production from the hera - ii running period @xcite .",
    "the zeus collaboration reported on two charm measurements in dis with hera - ii data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zeus - f2c ] ) : one analysis @xcite uses @xmath11 mesons to identify charm production , and utilizes @xmath12 of new data to achieve improved statistical accuracy compared to previous analyses .",
    "the second analysis @xcite uses @xmath13 mesons instead and is one of the first measurements to utilize the new silicon strip micro vertex detector ( mvd ) of zeus .",
    "based on @xmath14 , this analysis achieves similar accuracies as previous zeus measurements of the inclusive charm cross section in dis .",
    "the zeus collaboration has recently also finalized two analyses of charm production from older hera - i data @xcite .",
    "one analysis @xcite covers the region of very low momentum transfer ( @xmath15 ) at the transition between photoproduction and dis .",
    "the data provide a good test of perturbative qcd calculations , which are available in nlo , and are well described by massive calculations in the fixed flavour number scheme , as implemented in the hvqdis program @xcite . in the second analysis @xcite , the pseudoscalar states",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are reconstructed , rather than the vector state @xmath19 , which allows a measurement of the fragmentation fractions , which turn out to be compatible with those measured in @xmath20 annihilation and in photoproduction @xcite . the inclusive charm cross section derived from this measurement is consistent with previous results . also a new",
    ", preliminary measurement of charm fragmentation was presented by the zeus collaboration @xcite , which shows broad agreement with other measurements from h1 @xcite , and also with measurements from @xmath20 experiments .",
    "measurements from zeus . ]    another new measurement of @xmath11 production in dis , based on @xmath21 of hera - ii data , was presented by the h1 collaboration @xcite . here ,",
    "differential and double differential visible cross sections for @xmath11 production were measured and compared to the qcd calculations .",
    "overall , these quantities are well described by the nlo predictions of hvqdis ; in fact , the data uncertainties are in many cases smaller than the theory uncertainties from the variation of the charm mass and the variation of the renormalization and factorization scales . however , in some quantities , most notably the @xmath22 distribution , even in spite of the relatively large theory uncertainties the nlo predictions deviate significantly from the trend observed in data .",
    "this confirms , with higher statistics , the observation made in a recently published analysis from the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , that analysis goes one step further and investigates @xmath11 production in dis in conjunction with jets . as heavy flavour production is dominated by boson gluon fusion , a two - jet structure is expected for most of the events . in the dis analysis , one jet in addition to the @xmath11 meson is required .",
    "again , hvqdis describes the data satisfactorily , with the notable exception of the azimuthal angle difference @xmath23 between the @xmath11 and the jet , a quantity which would be almost exactly equal to @xmath24 in leading order , where the two charm jets must be back - to - back ; hard gluon emission , which enters only in nlo , leads to an enhancement at lower values of @xmath23 , which is underestimated by hvqdis , whereas monte carlo models such as cascade @xcite , which include parton showers as approximation for higher - order gluon radiation , work significantly better . in another recent publication @xcite",
    ", the h1 collaboration has investigated charm photoproduction with two jets , with very similar findings .",
    "the results show that charm measurements have now reached a level of accuracy where more precise qcd predictions would be desirable . on one hand a full nlo monte carlo with matched parton showers",
    "is needed , as opposed to hvqdis , which produces only parton four - vectors and has been augmented with relatively simple independent fragmentation routines to make the extraction of visible cross sections possible .",
    "a second way to reduce theory uncertainties would be to reduce the variation of input parameters such as the charm mass or fragmentation parameters by detailed comparisons between mc predictions and data of ( double ) differential visible cross sections in terms of relevant quantities such as @xmath25 and @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , nnlo calculations would provide the most reliable way to reduce theory uncertainties , in particular for inclusive quantities such as @xmath26 .",
    "beauty production at hera and the tevatron has generated a lot of interest in recent years , not least because at both colliders inclusive cross sections for beauty production were observed that are considerably higher than the expectation from perturbative qcd calculations in next - to - leading order .",
    "achim geiser gave an overview over the existing experimental results from hera , with additional glimpses at tevatron and ua1 data @xcite .",
    "he discussed in detail the issue of scale dependence of qcd calculations , where he presented a survey of qcd calculations in different orders of @xmath27 for a number of processes and argued that a good choice for the factorisation and renormalisation scales @xmath28 would be a scale at which higher order calculations give a result that coincides with the calculations at lower order .",
    "he observed that this is achieved in most of the cases at a scale between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the `` natural '' choice of scale such as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "based on this observation he argued that the factorisation and renormalisation scales should be varied in the range @xmath35 , with a choice of @xmath36 for the central value , rather than using a variation of @xmath37 , as is customary in most hera publications .",
    "he also pointed out that this prescription has already been adopted silently by the tevatron experiments in recent preliminary results .",
    "this proposal was received well by the audience , as the discussion after the presentation showed .",
    "new , preliminary results on beauty production were presented by the d0 and cdf collaborations @xcite .",
    "d0 has performed a new measurement of muon tagged jet cross sections based on @xmath38 of data that extends up to @xmath39 .",
    "again , the data lie above the theory prediction . in a new measurement of inclusive b cross sections , the cdf collaboration utilizes the decays @xmath40 in addition to the previously used channel and @xmath41 , with consistent results .",
    "these measurements are also consistent with a fixed order calculation at next to leading log .",
    "the first , preliminary hera - ii result on beauty production , based on @xmath42 of data , was presented by the zeus collaboration @xcite .",
    "the results are somewhat higher , but still consistent with previous measurements from h1 @xcite .",
    "the inclusive production of charmonium and bottomium states in @xmath8 and @xmath43 collisions remains an intersting testing ground for perturbative qcd , as was shown in a review by katja krger @xcite .",
    "the working horse for these investigations are @xmath44 mesons , where the largest data sets are available .",
    "while leading order calculations in the colour singlet model @xcite fail to describe the production rates of @xmath44 mesons at the tevatron @xcite , nrqcd models @xcite models have been successfully applied there . in these models the production of @xmath45 states with different colour and spin / parity configuration is calculated perturbatively , and the transition to bound states is described by non - perturbative long distance matrix elements ( ldme ) , which have to be determined from data .",
    "this allows the production of @xmath44 mesons by gluon splitting into a @xmath45 pair , followed by a transition to a @xmath44 meson , which is predicted to be transversely polarized .",
    "the observation of such a polarization is therefore considered the `` smoking gun '' for ( large ) colour octet ( co ) contributions .",
    "however , new data from cdf that were presented at this conference @xcite show a clear evidence for longitudinal @xmath44 polarization , which is in contrast to nrqcd expectations .",
    "new data on @xmath46 polarisation are still not precise enough for firm conclusions .",
    "a second test of nrqcd predictions is the measurement of the production rates of @xmath47 versus @xmath48 states , which in nrqcd models is expected to follow the spin counting prediction of @xmath49 .",
    "new measurements from cdf @xcite give a significantly smaller result for the ratio of prompt @xmath50 production : @xmath51    after the initial success of the nrqcd model indications for the necessity of large co contributions where also searched for in inelastic @xmath44 production at hera .",
    "the h1 collaboration has presented new , preliminary data from hera - ii on inelastic @xmath44 production in deep inelastic @xmath8 scattering @xcite .",
    "production rates were measured double differentially in the transverse momentum @xmath52 and the momentum fraction @xmath53 of the @xmath44 meson , and compared to monte carlo predictions by programs which implement the colour singlet model in leading order .",
    "these models describe the shape of the measurements quite well , whereas the co contributions in nrqcd models tend to have different @xmath52 and @xmath53 shapes than the cs contributions .",
    "therefore , the new h1 data do not show any clear need for large co contributions to inelastic @xmath44 production . in the discussion of the results",
    "the need was stressed for nlo calculations of this process , in the cs as well as in nrqcd models .",
    "nlo calculations are currently only available in the cs model for photoproduction of @xmath44 mesons @xcite , where they describe the data from hera @xcite quite well .",
    "a different issue in charmonium production is adressed by the new data from hera - b @xcite : hera - b has collected large samples of @xmath44 and @xmath46 mesons decaying to @xmath54 and @xmath20 pairs , which made it possible to investigate the dependence of charmonium production on the atomic weight @xmath55 in a new range of feynman-@xmath56 , extending the range covered by the experiments down to @xmath57 , which is a region where theoretical models make widely different predictions .      the new results from heavy ion experiments at rhic have been reviewed in this conference by william zajc @xcite .",
    "therefore we only briefly highlight some of the new results presented in the heavy flavour session .",
    "new results on heavy quark production in au@xmath58au collisions were presented by the phenix @xcite and the star @xcite collaborations . due to their larger mass and the dead cone effect , charm quarks",
    "are expected to lose energy at a smaller rate than light quarks .",
    "the observation of supression of electrons from charm decays in central au@xmath58au collisions @xcite therefore comes as a surprise .",
    "it appears that charm quarks participate in the flow of the opaque hadronic medium just as much as light quarks , which means that they thermalize more quickly than expected in many theoretical models .",
    "the phenix collaboration has also presented new measurements of @xmath44 suppression in au@xmath58au collisions @xcite .",
    "these measurements , which are performed in two rapidity ranges @xmath59 and @xmath60 , show a significant suppression of @xmath44 production in au@xmath58au collisions , which is stronger at large rapidities than at central rapidity values .",
    "the explanation of this rapidity dependence is a real challenge to theoretical models .      the large data sets from the b factory experiments babar and belle , from cleo - c and from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0 have lead to a renewed interest in the spectroscopy of charm and bottom hadrons with beautyful results , and have opened the possibility to identify extremely rare decays .",
    "in the charmonium system , finally all expected charmonium states below the d - meson threshold have now been firmly identified .",
    "one of last two missing states , the @xmath61 , has now seen by babar , cleo - c , and belle @xcite , at an average mass of @xmath62 .",
    "this allows a comparison of the hyper fine splitting of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 states in the charmonium system , which are @xmath65 and @xmath66 ; the large difference of these values poses a challenge to theory @xcite .",
    "the long elusive @xmath67 state has observed by cleo - c @xcite in the decay chain @xmath68 , @xmath69 , with a mass of @xmath70 , which corresponds to a hyper fine splitting between the @xmath67 and the center of gravity of the @xmath71 states of @xmath72 , consistent with the expected value of zero .",
    "meanwhile , cleo - c has increased its @xmath73 sample eightfold , which yield the promise of further , improved results .",
    "in addition to these expected charmonium states , recent years have seen the discovery of several unexpected charmonium - like resonances :    new results were obtained on the @xmath74 , which is already considered firmly established by the pdg @xcite , and on the @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "results were also presented on two additional states , the @xmath77 and the @xmath78 .    for the @xmath74 ,",
    "one explanation that has been put forward is the interpretation as a @xmath79 molecule .",
    "cleo has performed a new measurement of the @xmath16 mass @xcite : @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the total uncertainty of this measurement of @xmath81 is a factor of 2.2 better than the uncertainty of @xmath82 of the 2006 world average @xcite .",
    "combinig this result with the pdg06 value of the @xmath74 mass of @xmath83 results in a very small binding energy of @xmath84 for a @xmath79 molecule @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , belle and babar have also found indications for the @xmath74 in the decays @xmath85 ( belle ) and @xmath86 ( babar ) @xcite . in these channels ,",
    "the observed mass values for the @xmath74 of @xmath87 ( belle ) @xcite and @xmath88 ( babar ) are @xmath89 higher than the current world average .",
    "belle also concludes that the quantum numbers @xmath90 are favoured if the observed enhancement is indeed the @xmath74 .",
    "all in all , the interpretation of this state remains unclear .",
    "new data were also presented on the @xmath76 @xcite , which was first observed in initial state radiation events at babar .",
    "babar sets a limit @xcite of @xmath91 , which is a further indication that the @xmath76 is not a conventional charmonium state .",
    "cleo has also confirmed the @xmath76 @xcite , and finds @xcite its mass to be @xmath92 , in poor agreement with the original babar measurement @xcite of @xmath93 .",
    "the latest belle @xcite result @xmath94 is consistent with the cleo measurement .",
    "the discovery of new , unexpected charmonium - like states has also triggered new investigations of @xmath95 at belle and cleo @xcite .",
    "these scans show a marked dip around the @xmath76 .",
    "belle , babar and cleo have also looked @xcite into the more exclusive channels @xmath96 .",
    "a weak signal for the @xmath76 is seen in the @xmath97 channel , no signal in the @xmath98 channel , and a dip , similar to the one observed in the inclusive @xmath99 measurement , is observed in the @xmath100 channel around the @xmath76 resonance",
    ".    meanwhile , babar observes yet another state @xcite in initial state production of @xmath101 at a mass of @xmath102 and a width of @xmath103 , which is incompatible with the @xmath76 or other known states such as the @xmath104 .",
    "three more states observed by belle @xcite , termed @xmath77 , @xmath75 , and @xmath78 , may have an interpretation as conventional charmonium states , namely the @xmath105 $ ] , the @xmath106 $ ] and the @xmath107 $ ] .      in the sector of charmed , strange mesons new measurements were presented by babar and belle @xcite . in addition to new measurements of the properties of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 , another new state , termed @xmath110 , has been identified by babar @xcite with a mass @xmath111 and a spin parity assignment @xmath112 .",
    "in addition , a hint for another state with @xmath113 has also been observed .",
    "furthermore , belle , in a dalitz analysis of the decay @xmath114 , sees indications for a state @xmath115 with @xmath116 , with quantum numbers @xmath117 favoured .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of these states is not yet clear .",
    "while the @xmath108 and @xmath109 states can be explained as @xmath118 and @xmath119 p - wave @xmath120 states , their masses are substantially lower than expected from potential models .",
    "the interpretation of the other states is still less clear .",
    "coming to charmed baryons , babar and belle have reported discoveries of several new states @xcite .",
    "both observe the new state @xmath121 in the channels @xmath122 ( babar ) and @xmath123 ( belle ) @xcite .",
    "the belle discovery of the new charmed , strange baryons @xmath124 and @xmath125 has been confirmed by babar @xcite , and belle sees also some evidence for the isospin partners @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "babar has also reported the first observation of the @xmath128 , an excited @xmath129 state @xcite .      in the b meson sector",
    ", the progress comes from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath130 has already been observed by both experiments , now cdf reports the first direct observation of the @xmath130 in the exclusive decay channel @xmath131 , which allows a very precise mass measurement with the preliminary result of @xmath132 , while the uncertainty on the old world average was @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath134 is last spin singlet ground state in the bottomium sector that has not been unambiguously discovered yet .",
    "cdf has performed a new search for the decay @xmath135 , without indications for a signal .",
    "both , d0 and cdf , report first direct observations on orbitally excited b mesons with @xmath136 by looking for decays @xmath137 .",
    "both see clear evidence for @xmath138 and @xmath139 states . with a similar analysis of the channels",
    "@xmath140 both experiments observe also the @xmath141 state , in addition cdf reports evidence for the @xmath142 state .      in the bottom baryon sector ,",
    "where up to now the @xmath143 is the only well established particle , cdf performed a blind analysis of the decay channel @xmath144 ; after unblinding , four resonances were found with significances greater than @xmath145 , which constitute the first direct observation of @xmath146 baryons .",
    "the resonances are identified as the @xmath147 and the @xmath148 .      in the field of rare decays ,",
    "the large data sets of altogether more than 1 billion @xmath149 events obtained at the b factory experiments allow more and more precise measurements of @xmath150 decay modes @xcite , which are interesting because in the standard model they are forbidden at tree level and proceed through loop diagrams . in extensions of the standard model , additional particles contribute to the loops , which may lead to observable deviations of the transition rates from the expected sm values .",
    "while the @xmath151 decay channels are investigated with higher and higher precision , the large statistics now allows even the measurement of @xmath152 transitions , which were first observed by belle in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the latest compilation from the heavy flavour averaging group @xcite contains 20 measured @xmath153 decay channels , with branching fractions as small as @xmath154 for @xmath155 and precisions down to @xmath156 for @xmath157 .",
    "the 2006 average for @xmath151 decays @xcite is now @xmath158 , which is on the high side of recent nnlo predictions @xcite .",
    "the latest measurements from babar and belle of @xmath159 @xcite are particularly impressive , measuring branching fractions around @xmath160 , in some cases with more than @xmath145 significance . from a combination of the @xmath161 measurements from belle and babar ,",
    "a constraint of @xmath162 has been derived .",
    "a very difficult , but interesting decay channel is @xmath163 @xcite , which has been observed by belle at @xmath164 significance with a branching ratio of @xmath165 , while babar measures @xmath166 , or , translated into a @xmath167  cl limit , @xmath168 .",
    "the combination of both results yields @xmath169 , corresponding to a @xmath89 evidence .",
    "this result can be used to derive limits on the @xmath170 mass in susy models .",
    "after the observation of @xmath171 oscillations , the search for the decays @xmath172 might be considered the next race in b physics .",
    "the standard model expectations for these decays are extremely small , and probably out of reach for current experiments : @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "again , these decays can only proceed through loop diagrams in the sm , and contributions from new particles may increase the rate by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "both tevatron experiments have searched for the @xmath175 decay and have reported new , preliminary results based on new run - ii data .",
    "the limits are @xmath176 from cdf ( d0 ) ; these limits correspond to branching ratios that are 29 ( 27 ) times larger than the sm expectation .",
    "cdf has also reported a preliminary limit for @xmath177 decays : @xmath178 , which is 230 times greater than the sm expectation .",
    "while oscillations have long been established and thoroughly investigated in the @xmath179 and @xmath180 systems , until recently the frequency of the @xmath2 oscillations had not been measured , and no firm signal for mixing in the @xmath3 system had been observed . during the last year , both these gaps in our knowledge of neutral meson mixing have been filled .",
    "the @xmath171 oscillation frequency has now been measured by the tevatron experiments @xcite .",
    "after the first report on a double sided limit for the @xmath171 oscillation frequency of @xmath181 at @xmath167  cl from the d0 collaboration @xcite , cdf has for the first time observed a nonzero oscillation amplitude with more than @xmath182 significance @xcite , at a frequency @xmath183 , consistent with the d0 result .",
    "meanwhile , the d0 collaboration has gone several steps further .",
    "based on a sample of @xmath184 of decays @xmath185 , d0 has made a new measurement @xcite of the difference between the lifetimes of the long and short lived @xmath171 eigenstates .",
    "both states can decay to the @xmath186 final state , and by fitting the decay angle distributions their respective contributions to the sample at different eigentimes can be determined , with the result @xmath187 . for the first time , the d0 collaboration has used this data also to extract the cp violating phase @xmath188 , which is the relative phase of the off - diagonal elements of the mass and decay matrices in the @xmath189 basis , from this data : @xmath190 .",
    "the sm prediction for @xmath188 is very small , namely @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "d0 has also reported on a new measurement @xcite of the branching ratio @xmath192 , which is lower than the only pre - existing measurement from aleph .",
    "this branching ratio is linked theoretically to the width difference     ( wrong - sign ws ) decays from babar ]    @xmath193 between the cp - even and odd @xmath171 eigenstates .",
    "the resulting constraint is @xmath194 .",
    "while the difficulty in @xmath195 mixing lies in the fact that the mixing is almost perfect because the oscillations occur much faster than the decay , the situation is reversed in the @xmath196 system . here ,",
    "the standard model prediction for the mixing parameters @xmath197 and @xmath198 are very small @xcite , of the order @xmath199 , which means that the @xmath16 decays much faster than one oscillation period lasts .",
    "again , additional particles in the loop may increase the mixing , which could indicate new physics .",
    "in particular , new physics processes such as flavour - changing neutral currents , susy particles etc",
    ". would increase @xmath200 ( i.e. , the oscillation frequency ) , but not @xmath201 ( the lifetime difference ) .    until march of this year",
    ", the no - mixing case had been disfavoured with a significance of @xmath202 by belle ( babar ) analyses @xcite .",
    "then both collaborations published two papers titled `` evidence for @xmath3 mixing '' side by side in physics review letters @xcite , both reporting more than @xmath182 evidence for @xmath3 oscillations .",
    "the belle analysis is based on @xmath203 of data and measures the difference in apparent lifetime for the cp even decays @xmath204 to the lifetime of the decay @xmath205 .",

    ", the belle collaboration has performed a dalitz analysis of the decay @xmath207 , which provides the most sensitive result on @xmath200 to date : @xmath208 and disfavours the no - mixing solution with @xmath209 significance @xcite .",
    "the babar analysis uses @xmath210 of data and analyses the decays @xmath211 .",
    "the dominant decay mode is the right - sign ( rs ) decay mode to @xmath212 , while the wrong - sign ( ws ) decay mode to @xmath213 may occur as doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) decay or through mixing .",

    "heavy flavour physics will be of interest at the experiments atlas , cms @xcite and lhcb @xcite .    in atlas and cms ,",
    "the expected rates for beauty production are high : at a luminosity of @xmath215 , around @xmath216 @xmath217 pairs will be produced per second , which should allow high precision measurements despite the difficult environment .",
    "the big challenge here is to set up a reasonably efficient trigger , because bottom quarks are predominantly produced at relatively low transverse momenta , while the detectors are optimized for high-@xmath218 discovery physics .    in the initial , `` low '' luminosity phase with expected luminosities around @xmath215 ,",
    "the atlas experiment envisages to use single particle triggers at level 1 , which will be refined by searches for more complex signatures in the high level trigger ( hlt ) @xcite .",
    "channels that have been studied include e.g. @xmath219 with subsequent decays @xmath220 , states involving a electromagnetic signature such as @xmath221 , and final states with two muons . in the high luminosity mode at @xmath222 ,",
    "level 1 will predominantly use the dimuon channel to identify @xmath44 or @xmath223 decays to @xmath224 .",
    "cms will also use muon triggers at level 1 , and plans to identify decay vertices from heavy flavour decays in the high level trigger .",
    "a number of topics have been studied by both collaborations , such as the measurement of inclusive beauty cross sections ( cms ) , the measurement of @xmath225 in the golden mode @xmath226 ( atlas ) , analysis of @xmath185 decays ( atlas and cms ) , and searches for rare decays such as @xmath227 , @xmath228 or @xmath229 ( atlas ) .",

    "recall that currently cdf and d0 have reported upper limits of @xmath249 for the branching ratio @xcite based on samples of @xmath240 ( d0 ) and @xmath250 ( cdf ) ; these limits lie about 30 times above the sm expectation of @xmath251 .",
    "a recent atlas study concludes that with an integrated luminosity of @xmath252 , corresponding to about three year s running in the low luminosity mode , an upper limit of @xmath253 at @xmath167 cl is achieveable , which is about a factor of two above the sm expectation .",
    "cms concludes that it could provide a limit of @xmath254 ( four times the sm expectation ) with @xmath231 , i.e. one year s worth of data .",
    "lhcb on the other hand , which will operate at lower luminosities , claims a sensitivity that would allow a @xmath182 observation of the decay @xmath255 at the standard model branching ratio of @xmath251 with @xmath240 , corresponding to one year s worth of data @xcite at nominal luminosity .    looking even farther into the future ,",
    "tim greenshaw reported on the applications of heavy flavour at the planned innternational linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite , an @xmath20 collider with a centre - of - mass energy between @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "the detector designs for this machine forsee a very good flavour separation power , which calls for vertex detectors with spectacular performance .",
    "several groups are currently investigating various technologies that could fulfill the requirements for the inner pixel detector of an ilc detector .",
    "one important application of the heavy flavour identification capabilities of such a detector would be the measurement of the various branching fractions of a higgs boson . even if only one neutral higgs boson were found at the lhc , this would allow to check wether these fractions are consistent with the predictions from the standard model , where only one higgs doublet is assumed and therefore all branching fractions depend only on the mass of the single physical higgs boson , or whether for instance up- and down - type fermions have different couplings to the higgs , as expected for instance in supersymmetric models , which have at least two higgs doublets .",
    "heavy flavour production at hera and tevatron remains an interesting field of research , both from the experimental and the theory side .",
    "the experimental results become more and more precise , which makes it interesting to include them in the determination of parton densities , provided that the theoretical obstacles can be overcome and uncertainties arising from charm mass and fragmentation functions are treated consistently between experiment and theory .",
    "the beauty production data have taught us that the calculation of production cross sections do not always become more accurate for heavier quarks if there is sufficient phase space for qcd dynamics , which is something to keep in mind for lhc , where also the top will fall into this category .    during the last years we have seen a veritable renaissance of hadron spectroscopy . as the particle data book fills up ,",
    "we see more and more results that indicate how incomplete our understanding of hadron structure still is , as illustrated by unexpected differences in hyperfine splittings in the charmonium sector @xcite , by unexpected states and masses in the @xmath258 system @xcite , and by the appearance of charmonium - like resonances for which we have no ready explanation @xcite .",
    "while resonances that do not fit into the conventional @xmath259 picture have been known for a long time in the light meson sector , we now learn that also in the heavy quark sector there is more than is written in our philosophy . on the other hand ,",
    "the investigation of rare decays such as @xmath260 or @xmath261 and other rare processes such as @xmath3 mixing , where we wait for results that would point to physics beyond the standard model , has once again failed to turn up anything unexpected .",
    "in this section , we summarize the six theory contributions to the heavy - flavor working group , emphasizing computations that have been performed during the years 2006 and 2007 and have therefore not yet been presented at previous dis workshops @xcite .",
    "we start with new perturbative results for inclusive final states , i.e.  heavy - quark structure functions and their relation to parton densities , and then move on to less inclusive final states , in particular quarkonium production and decay and heavy - quark spectroscopy . for the latter",
    "we emphasize new results from lattice qcd and qcd sum rules .",
    "note that a series of new calculations on open heavy - quark production at various colliders in the general - mass variable - flavor number scheme ( gm - vfns ) has been presented at this workshop in an introductory plenary talk by g.  kramer @xcite .",
    "the heavy - quark coefficient functions for deep - inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ( dis ) in the kinematic regime @xmath262 have been calculated more than ten years ago in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of qcd by m.  buza et al . , using operator product expansion techniques @xcite . here",
    "@xmath263 and @xmath264 stand for the masses squared of the virtual photon and heavy quark respectively .",
    "the analytical results had been expressed in terms of 48 independent functions and had been used to check earlier , general calculations , which were , however , only accessible via large computer programs .",
    "j.  blmlein has now presented a re - calculation of the @xmath265 massive operator matrix elements for the twist-2 operators , which contribute to the heavy flavor wilson coefficients in unpolarized dis in the region @xmath266 , using light - cone expansion techniques and confirming the above - cited calculation @xcite .",
    "the application of the integration - by - parts method and harmonic sums in mellin space allowed for a significant compactification of the results , which can now be expressed in terms of the basis @xmath267 and @xmath268 , i.e.of only two independent functions .",
    "while the proton is just a simple @xmath269 fock state in the quark model , the possibility of an intrinsic - charm , i.e.  a @xmath270 , component has repeatedly been put forward in the context of light - cone @xcite or meson - cloud models @xcite .",
    "tung et al .",
    "have performed global fits of parton density functions ( pdfs ) , assuming that the charm - density is not only generated radiatively at @xmath271 and then evolved to @xmath272 , but allowing for the possibility of light - cone , meson - cloud , or sea - quark like intrinsic charm density @xcite .",
    "the quality of each fit is measured by a global @xmath273 , shown in fig .",
    "[ hfl:1 ] as a function of the momentum fraction @xmath274 carried by the charm quark at the starting scale @xmath275 gev . for @xmath276 ,",
    "the quality of the fit varies very little , i.e.  the global analysis of hard - scattering data     gev for the light - cone ( solid curve ) , meson - cloud ( dashed curve ) , and sea - like model ( dotted curve ) . ]",
    "provides no evidence either for or against intrinsic charm . above this point ,",
    "all three curves in fig.[hfl:1 ] rise steeply with @xmath277 , so that global fits do place useful upper bounds on intrinsic charm .",
    "there is no data set that is particularly sensitive to intrinsic charm , but the global qcd analysis rules out the possibility of an intrinsic charm component much larger than @xmath242 in momentum fraction .",
    "a variation of the charm quark mass @xmath278 shows that the data prefer lower masses around 1.3 gev with respect to higher masses of 1.5 gev .",
    "the difference in @xmath273 is in this case almost entirely due to the charm contribution to the proton structure function @xmath279 , which has been precisely measured at hera .    turning to less inclusive quantities , the production and decay of heavy quark - antiquark bound states ( quarkonia @xmath280 ) is still far from understood .",
    "while the effective field theory of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) has long been believed to be phenomenologically successful and is still believed to be theoretically more consistent than the color - singlet model ( csm ) , recent tevatron run ii data on the polarization of large-@xmath281 @xmath282- and @xmath283-mesons do not support the idea that their production is dominated by color - octet fragmentation processes as predicted in nrqcd . since higher - order qcd corrections are largely unknown ( except for color - singlet photoproduction @xcite , color - singlet and color - octet production in photon - photon collisions @xcite and a very recent calculation for direct color - singlet hadroproduction @xcite ) , other theoretical frameworks continue to be investigated .",
    "one example is the @xmath284-factorization formalism , where the production cross section @xmath285 is computed by a double convolution of unintegrated parton densities @xmath286 and partonic cross section @xmath287 over longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath288 and intrinsic transverse momenta @xmath289 of the reggeized partons @xmath99 in the ( anti-)proton @xmath290 ( @xmath291 ) .",
    "this method has been applied by kniehl et al .  to charmonium production at different colliders @xcite and now , as v.a .",
    "saleev reported , also to bottomonium hadroproduction at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the long - distance operator matrix elements ( omes ) of nrqcd have been refitted to the @xmath281-spectra of prompt @xmath283 mesons at the tevatron .",
    "since the intrinsic @xmath284 leads to a harder @xmath281-spectrum already for the color - singlet contributions , the color - octet omes turn out to be considerably smaller and in many cases even consistent with zero , as their values are not sufficiently constrained by the data .",
    "in addition , the results depend strongly on the assumed unintegrated parton densities , which are poorly known and only constrained to agree with the integrated ones , @xmath292 as can be seen from tab .",
    "[ hfl:2 ] , the quality of the fit , measured    .[hfl:2]omes of the @xmath293 and @xmath294 mesons from fits to cdf data from runs i and ii in the regge - kinematics approach using unintegrated gluon distributions by j.  blmlein ( jb ) , jung and salam ( js ) , and kimber , martin and ryskin ( kmr ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     theoretical uncertainties with the chosen masses and scales and with respect to possible color - octet contributions has not been performed .",
    "the calculated @xmath44-decay branching ratios to the @xmath295-wave mesons @xmath296 and @xmath297 fit the data well , while that of @xmath298 ( if treated as an @xmath299 meson ) is predicted to be @xmath300 , which implies that @xmath301 can not be the @xmath299 or @xmath302 meson .",
    "decays of @xmath295-wave charmonia @xmath303 ( @xmath304 ) have also been studied .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath305 is predicted to be @xmath306 , which may be tested by cleo - c and besiii with future experiments .",
    "a similar calculation has been performed for the radiative decays of bottomonia into charmonia and light mesons , taking into account in addition the sometimes significant qed contributions @xcite . while the results for radiative decays into truly non - relativistic charmonia are likely to be more reliable than those for radiative decays into ( in reality relativistic ) light mesons , these decays remain to be observed .",
    "on the other hand , the calculated branching ratios for @xmath307 ( @xmath308 ) and @xmath309 ( @xmath310 ) are only barely consistent with recent cleo data [ @xmath311 and @xmath312 , suggesting that the theoretical approach may still need improvement .    finally , j.m .",
    "richard reviewed the current status of light and heavy multiquark spectroscopy @xcite . while experimental evidence for the @xmath313 pentaquark @xmath314 seems to vanish , a single - charm baryon with a mass of 2940 mev and a width of approximately 17 mev",
    "has recently been confirmed by babar , and a double - charm baryon with a mass of 3520 mev may have been observed by the selex collaboration .",
    "potential models have since long predicted the existence of baryons with at least one heavy quark , assuming them to be diquark - quark systems that can be described with hyperspherical coordinates . in the meson sector , the state @xmath77 may be a @xmath315 candidate for a @xmath316 hybrid state , to be described in the born - oppenheimer approximation with classical constituent gluons .",
    "a second recently confirmed state is the @xmath74 , which qcd sum rules predict to be a @xmath317 @xmath318 bound state , even if the theoretical mass found is slightly larger ( @xmath319 mev ) @xcite .",

    "<S> during the last year many important results have been achieved in heavy flavour physics : new measurements of charm and beauty production have been performed at hera and the tevatron . a wealth of new spectroscopy data with several new , unexpected states in the charmonium and the @xmath0 systems has been collected and @xmath1 transitions have been established . the oscillation frequency in the @xmath2 is now measured , and mixing in the @xmath3 system has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical progress in the areas of open heavy flavour production , quarkonium production and decays , and multiquark spectroscopy has been presented at this workshop .    </S>",
