    "the technologically important lead zirconate titanate alloy ( i.e. , pbzr@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 usually denoted as pzt ) has an interesting phase diagram @xcite . increasing the ti @xmath6 composition yields progressively the following _ ground state _ phases : an antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase for @xmath6 @xmath7 0.1 , a ferroelectric rhombohedral fe@xmath8 phase for 0.1 @xmath7 @xmath6 @xmath7 0.4 , another ferroelectric rhombohedral fe@xmath9 phase for 0.4 @xmath7 @xmath6 @xmath7 0.5 , and finally a tetragonal ferroelectric phase for @xmath6 larger than 50% .",
    "the high - temperature phase of this alloy at all compositions is the cubic perovskite structure .",
    "previous theoretical studies @xcite focused on the long - range b - site ordering effects in pzt for a ti composition equal to 0.5 , i.e. , close to the morphotropic phase boundary between rhombohedral and tetragonal ferroelectric phases .",
    "the subject of the present theoretical study is rather different : we will investigate alloying and ferroelectric effects on structural , chemical and dielectric properties in the tetragonal phase of the pzt alloy .",
    "in other words , we would like to know what are the effects of alloying and ferroelectricity on bond lengths , chemical bonding and born effective charges in pzt with high ti content .",
    "1.48truein    we focus on the ordered structure shown in fig .  1 and exhibiting a ti composition equal to 2/3 . the b - site ordering of this supercell consists of one zr plane alternating with two ti planes along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "we perform local - density approximation ( lda ) calculations on this supercell using the vanderbilt ultrasoft - pseudopotential scheme @xcite , and including the semicore shells for _ all _ the metals considered . specifically , the pb @xmath10 , @xmath2 and @xmath11 , the zr @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the ti @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath0 and @xmath12 , and the o @xmath18 and @xmath1 electrons are treated as valence electrons .",
    "we choose the plane - wave cutoff to be 25 ry and use the ceperley - alder exchange and correlation @xcite as parameterized by perdew and zunger @xcite .",
    "the first - principles calculations throughout this work are performed using a ( 6,6,2 ) monkhorst - pack mesh @xcite .",
    "further technical details of the procedure used in the present study can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact , we perform two different calculations corresponding to two different symmetries of the structure shown in fig .  1 : ( 1 ) using a centrosymmetric cell ( i.e. , exhibiting an inversion symmetry about the central pb atom ) ; and ( 2 ) using a ferroelectric cell ( i.e. , relaxing the inversion symmetry constraint ) .",
    "results of calculation ( 1 ) identify the alloying effects on various physical properties , while comparison of ( 1 ) with ( 2 ) allows us to isolate the ferroelectric effects on those properties .",
    "the lattice parameter , the axial ratio c / a and the atomic positions along the [ 001 ] ( compositional ) direction are optimized in calculation ( 1 ) by minimizing the total energy and the hellmann - feynman forces , the latter being converged to within 0.02 ev /  .    the ferroelectric experimental ground state of pb(zr@xmath19ti@xmath20)o@xmath5 has the tetragonal p4 mm point group and does not present any evidence of ( long - range ) b - site ordering . the material is thus composed of a succession of equivalent planes of composition zr@xmath19ti@xmath20 stacked along the tetragonal direction . to mimic this situation ,",
    "we have chosen the ferroelectric direction in the supercell of fig .  1 to lie along the [ 100 ] direction , rather than along the compositionally - modulated [ 001 ] direction . in our ferroelectric supercell , two axial ratios thus exist .",
    "these are the `` ferroelectric - related '' @xmath21 and the `` ordered - related '' @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the lengths of the supercell lattice vectors along the [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] , and [ 001 ] directions , respectively .",
    "we are thus dealing with a p2 mm orthorhombic ferroelectric supercell rather than with a p4 mm tetragonal ferroelectric supercell .",
    "however , in order to be as close as possible to the experimental situation , we will keep the @xmath22 ratio as equal to the ideal value of 3 . in this case",
    ", we shall refer to our ferroelectric cell as `` quasi - tetragonal '' along [ 100 ] ( i.e. , tetragonal as regards the axial ratios , although true tetragonal symmetry is broken down to orthorhombic by the b - plane ordering in the [ 001 ] direction ) .",
    "the lattice parameter @xmath24 , the axial ratio @xmath21 , and the atomic positions along the [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] directions are then optimized in calculation ( 2 ) by minimizing the total energy and the hellmann - feynman forces ( again to within a tolerance of 0.02 ev /   for the forces ) .",
    "the determination of the electronic ground state in calculations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is used to investigate the ferroelectric effects on the bond length distribution and on the chemical bonding in pzt with high ti content .",
    "the effective charges in each case ( i.e. , in both non - centrosymmetric and centrosymmetric cells ) will then be calculated from the polarization differences between the ground state and slightly distorted structures , following the procedure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and intensively used in ref .",
    "optimizing each degree of freedom in the centrosymmetric supercell leads to the lattice vectors @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 $ ] , and @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29=7.498 a.u .",
    "is the lattice parameter .",
    "the renormalized @xmath22 ratio defined as the actual ratio ( i.e. , 2.99 ) divided by the ideal one ( i.e. , 3.00 ) is equal to 0.997 and is thus very close to unity . for this reason , our centrosymmetric supercell can be referred as `` quasi - cubic '' , which is consistent with the fact that the experimental paraelectric phase of pzt is cubic .",

    "these atomic motions lead to shortened ti  o bonds and lengthened zr  o bonds .",
    "for example , the ti1o1 bond length shrinks to 1.89  , while zr1o7 enlarges to 2.11  , to be compared with the unrelaxed b  o bond length of 1.98   in the ideal structure . as a matter of fact , the appearance of several different bond lengths associated with the mixed sublattice seems to be a general feature of alloying , and has also been observed and predicted in zinc - blende , wurtzite and rocksalt alloys @xcite .",
    "alloying effects in the present ordered [ 001 ] structure also lead to a change in the lengths of the pb ",
    "for example , the pb3o bonds can be decomposed into three different groups : shorter pb3o bonds ( e.g. , pb3o5 equal to 2.73  ) , roughly unrelaxed pb3o bonds ( e.g. , pb3o7 equal to 2.80  ) , and long pb3o bonds ( e.g. , pb3-o8 equal to 2.91  ) .",
    "the three groups are populated in the ratio 4:4:4 .",
    "thus , alloying has some significant effects on the b  o bonds ( @xmath354.5% change in bond lengths ) , and to a smaller extent , on the pb",

    "i. they exhibit the same trends as in cubic bulk pbtio@xmath5 and pbzro@xmath5 compounds @xcite : large values of about + 4.0 for pb atoms ; large values around + 6.5 for the b atoms ; and two sets of values for the oxygen atoms , either close to -5.5 for oxygen atoms moving parallel to the b  o  b chain , or close to -2.5 for oxygen atoms moving perpendicular to these chains .",
    "the large values of the effective charges for b and o atoms are due to a ( weak ) hybridization between the b @xmath38 and o @xmath1 orbitals @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that along the [ 001 ] axis , the effective charge of ti is very similar to that of zr , while the difference between these two effective charges in the bulk parent compounds is larger than 1.0 ( i.e. , 7.06 _ vs. _ 5.85 for ti and zr respectively , according to ref .",
    "one can also point out that the effective charge along [ 001 ] for atom o7 sitting between the ti and zr atoms is -5.39 , i.e. , very close to the average value -5.32 of the corresponding oxygen effective charges in the bulk parents ( -5.83 and -4.81 for pbtio@xmath39 and pbzro@xmath39 respectively , according to ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we now turn to a consideration of the _ ferroelectric _ effects on bond - length distributions and effective charges .",
    "optimizing each degree of freedom in the non - centrosymmetric cell previously described yields the following lattice vectors in atomic units : @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] , and @xmath42 $ ] , where the lattice parameter is @xmath43=7.461 a.u .",
    ", i.e. , 0.5% smaller than for the centrosymmetric cell .",
    "a similar decrease of the lattice constant of around 0.7% has also been theoretically predicted when going from the paraelectric cubic phase to the tetragonal ferroelectric phase of the bulk pbtio@xmath5 compound @xcite . by looking at @xmath44",
    ", we also notice that our calculation predicts a `` ferroelectric - related '' axial ratio @xmath21 of 1.040",
    ". this prediction must be very close to the true value in pb(zr@xmath19ti@xmath20 ) , since recent measurements performed on pb(zr@xmath3ti@xmath4 ) films @xcite for @xmath6=0.6 found a value of 1.035 for this ratio , to be compared with values of 1.064 and 1.02 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively @xcite .",
    "the optimized non - centrosymmetric cell has an energy that is 0.15 ev/5-atom - cell lower than that of the optimized centrosymmetric cell .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the experimental ground state of pb(zr@xmath19ti@xmath20 ) is ferroelectric and tetragonal rather than paraelectric and cubic .",
    "the relaxed atomic positions and the effective charges in the non - centrosymmetric structure are shown in table ii .",
    "the quantities @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath32 are the [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] atomic displacements of the ferroelectric structure with respect to the ideal ordered structure associated with @xmath44 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are the effective charges along the [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] directions , respectively .",
    "a comparison of tables i and ii leads to the following observations .",
    "( i ) the atomic displacements along the [ 001 ] direction are quite comparable between the centrosymmetric and the non - centrosymmetric phases .",
    "( ii ) the ferroelectricity in tetragonal pzt is mainly characterized by the very large displacement of oxygen atoms along the tetragonal [ 100 ] direction ( as in tetragonal pbtio@xmath5 bulk ) , the large displacement of pb atoms along the [ @xmath4900 ] direction , and by the slight displacement of zr atoms along the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "this ferroelectric atomic relaxation yields two different ti  o bond lengths along the [ 100 ] direction : a very long bond of length 2.33  , which is even longer than the longest zr  o bond ( 2.16  ) ; and a very short bond of length 1.55  .",
    "this very short ti ",
    "o bond is much shorter than the shortest zr  o bond of 1.95  , and is even much shorter than the shortest ti  o bond of 1.78   occurring in tetragonal ferroelectric pbtio@xmath5 .",
    "ferroelectricity also leads to a drastic change in the pb",
    " o bonds .",
    "there are now some very short pb ",
    "o bonds with an average length of 2.51  , `` normal '' pb ",
    "o bonds with an average length of 2.84  , and very long pb ",
    "o bonds with an average length of 3.26  . as in the centrosymmetric cell ,",
    "the population ratio between these three groups is again 4:4:4 .",
    "however , the oxygens exhibiting the shortest pb ",
    "o bonds now share a common ( 100 ) plane , while they share a common ( 001 ) plane in the non - polar structure .",
    "pair - distribution function analysis of recent pulsed neutron powder diffraction measurements on ferroelectric pzt alloys clearly confirms the existence of these three different groups @xcite .",
    "the experimental average value of the three different pb ",
    "o bond lengths is @xmath352.5  , @xmath352.9  , and @xmath353.4  , i.e. , in excellent agreement with our predictions .",
    "comparing table i and table ii also indicates that ferroelectricity leads to a striking decrease of the born effective charges .",
    "the most spectacular decrease occurs for the atoms exhibiting a large change in their bond lengths . as a matter of fact , the effective charges along the [ 100 ] direction for atoms ti1",
    ", pb3 and o6 all decrease by @xmath3520% with respect to the centrosymmetric case . in consequence , the effective charges of the ti atoms and pb atoms are reduced by 1.4 and 0.7 , respectively , relative to their non - polar values .",
    "previous theory has shown that a change of the effective charge by more than one unit of ` e ' is indeed not unusual in going from the cubic to tetragonal ferroelectric phase in perovskite compounds @xcite .",
    "the most extreme example appears to be for nb in knbo@xmath39 , where the effective charges change from 9.67 to 7.05 in the direction parallel to the tetragonal axis .    to further understand the ferroelectric effects in pzt , fig .  2",
    "compares the electronic charge density in the ( b , o ) planes for the    [ t ! ]    3.6truein    centrosymmetric and non - centrosymmetric cases .",
    "figure 3 shows a similar comparison but in the ( pb , o ) planes . figure 2 indicates that ferroelectricity in pzt leads ( i ) to a chemical breaking of some ti  o bonds which generates the long ti  o bonds of 2.33  , and ( ii ) to the formation of strong covalency between ti and o , which is the cause of the very short ti  o bonds of 1.55  .",
    "in fact , we also found similar behavior for the electronic charge density in the ( ti , o ) plane for cubic and tetragonal lead titanate ( pt ) .",
    "thus , as in bulk pt @xcite , the formation of ferroelectricity in tetragonal pzt leads to an enhancement of hybridization between ti @xmath0 and o @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "interestingly , we do nt observe in fig .  2 any breaking of zr ",
    "o bonds nor the formation of strong covalent zr  o bonds .",
    "the different chemical behavior between zr and ti may perhaps be the cause of the difference in ground states exhibited by the corresponding bulk parents ( antiferroelectric and orthorhombic for pbzro@xmath5 _ vs. _ ferroelectric and tetragonal for pbtio@xmath5 ) .",
    "the striking feature of fig .",
    "3 is the formation of covalent chains between pb and o atoms , which is the cause of the very short pb - o bonds of 2.5  .",
    "we also found similar trends in the ( pb , o ) planes of paraelectric and ferroelectric pt .",
    "thus , as in bulk pt @xcite , the hybridization between pb @xmath2 and o @xmath1 orbitals plays an important role in the ferroelectric behavior of tetragonal pzt .    [ !",
    "using 15-atom supercells and vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials within the local - density approximation , we investigated alloying and ferroelectric effects on the bond lengths , chemical bonding and effective charges in lead zirconate titanate alloys ( pzt ) .",
    "our principal findings are as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the centrosymmetric pzt alloy is mainly characterized by two sets of b  o bonds ( shorter ti ",
    "o bonds _ vs. _  longer zr  o bonds ) , while the pb  o bonds differ only slightly ( by @xmath352.5% ) from the ideal structure .",
    "\\(ii ) allowing ferroelectricity in pzt alloys has two striking chemical effects : enhancement of hybridization between ti @xmath0 and o @xmath1 orbitals , and hybridization between pb @xmath2 and o @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "\\(iii ) these chemical and ferroelectric effects lead to the formation of very short covalent ti  o bonds while breaking other ti  o bonds , and give rise to the formation of covalent chains of very short pb  o bonds .",
