    "the study of many - body systems typically starts from describing their interactions in terms of the sum of pair potentials .",
    "often it is advantageous and transparent to analyze such systems via effective interactions which emerge via integrating out certain degrees of freedom .",
    "this procedure , however , often generates many - body forces , beyond the linear superposition of basic pairwise forces .",
    "this kind of nonadditivity is present in various systems such as colloidal suspensions  @xcite , systems governed by quantum - electrodynamic casimir forces  @xcite , polymers  @xcite , granular systems  @xcite , nematic colloids  @xcite , and noble gases or nanoparticles with van der waals forces acting among them  @xcite .",
    "here we study quantitatively the importance of such many - body effects for critical casimir forces ( ccfs )  @xcite .",
    "these long - ranged effective forces arise upon approaching the critical point of the solvent due to the confinement of corresponding order parameter fluctuations  @xcite and have been analyzed by studying both theoretically and experimentally , the effective interaction between a single spherical colloid and a planar wall  @xcite , between two isolated spherical colloids  @xcite , as well as between two spherical colloids facing a homogeneous planar wall  @xcite .    recently dang and co - authors  @xcite have used effective pair potentials between colloids , as inferred from experiments , in order to perform monte carlo simulations of the phase behavior of colloidal suspensions with near - critical solvents .",
    "they have observed that many - body effects become rather significant as the solvent is brought thermodynamically close to a critical point .",
    "they have also found that many - body effects tend to decrease the net attraction between colloids , which contrasts with previous results from mean - field calculations for a system of two spherical colloids facing a planar homogeneous substrate  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "it was shown that many - body effects due to the presence of a substrate do not exhibit a uniform trend but can either increase or decrease the net attraction between colloids . in order to deepen the understanding of many - body effects concerning critical casimir interactions we consider a system of three colloidal particles under the influence of ccfs .",
    "these forces are characterized by universal scaling functions , which depend on the geometry of the configuration , the thermodynamic state of the system , and the boundary condition for the order parameter at the surface of the colloids . in order to determine such universal scaling functions and in face of the complexity of the geometry we resort to mean - field theory ( mft ) , which captures these functions as the leading contribution to their systematic expansion in terms of @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the spatial dimension . to that end",
    "we consider the standard landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian for critical phenomena , which is given by    @xmath2 = \\int_v{\\rm d}^d\\mathbf{r } \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\nabla\\phi \\right)^2 + \\frac{\\tau}{2}\\phi^2 + \\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4 \\right\\ } ~,\\ ] ]    with appropriate boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "for the particular case of a binary liquid mixture near its demixing point , the order parameter @xmath3 is proportional to the difference between the local concentration of one of the two components and its critical value .",
    "@xmath4 is the volume completely filled by the fluid , @xmath5 is proportional to the reduced temperature @xmath6 , and the coupling constant @xmath7 stabilizes @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "the bulk correlation length diverges upon approaching the bulk critical point as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 in @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath14 , i.e. , within mft  @xcite .",
    "the two non - universal amplitudes @xmath15 are of molecular size and they form the universal ratio @xmath16 for @xmath12 and @xmath17 for @xmath14  @xcite . the bcs account for the adsorption preference of the confining surfaces ( in the present case , the surfaces of the three colloids ) for one of the two species of the mixture . from an experimental point of view",
    "it is difficult to quantify the strength of the adsorption preference .",
    "however , for the case of colloidal polystyrene particles immersed in binary liquid mixtures of water and lutidine there is a rather pronounced adsorption preference  @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider the critical adsorption fixed point  @xcite with the bc @xmath18 at a particle surface , which we refer to as @xmath19 .",
    "renormalization group theory tells that for @xmath20 the surface critical behavior of such systems is the one corresponding to this fixed point , irrespective of the actual strength of the adsorption preference for specific systems  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section_the_system ] we define the system and the scaling functions for the ccfs , as well as the normalization scheme . in sec .",
    "[ section_results ] we present the numerical results obtained for the universal scaling functions of the ccfs , from which we extract and analyze the three - body effects . in sec .",
    "[ section_conclusion ] we summarize our results and draw some conclusions .",
    "we study the ccfs acting on three colloidal particles immersed in a near - critical binary liquid mixture , which is at the critical concentration .",
    "the surfaces of the colloids are considered to have a strong adsorption preference for one of the two components of the mixture corresponding to @xmath21 or @xmath22 bcs , respectively .",
    "we calculate the forces numerically within the aforementioned mft [ see eq .  ] .",
    "in particular , we consider three three - dimensional , parallely aligned cylinders of radii @xmath23 with bcs @xmath24 at surface - to - surface distances @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see fig .  [ system_sketch ] ) . in the context of ccfs such elongated particles",
    "have so far been investigated only in three theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "the bcs of the whole system are represented by the set @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 can be either @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "it is important to mention that we discuss colloidal particles with the shape of hypercylinders in @xmath14 which are taken to be parallel along the @xmath34-direction as well as the fourth dimension with macroscopically long hyperaxes in these two directions .",
    "considering such hypercylinders allows us to minimize @xmath35 $ ] numerically using a finite element method  @xcite in order to obtain the spatially inhomogeneous order parameter profile @xmath36 for the geometries under consideration .",
    "as compared with the case of spherical colloids , the analysis for cylindrical colloids is technically simpler because the system as a whole is translationally invariant along all directions but two , i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( see fig .  [ system_sketch ] ) .",
    "this reduction in the number of relevant dimensions allows us to perform numerical calculations with adequate precision for a range of various model parameters which is wider than in the case of spherical colloids .",
    "it has advantageously turned out that qualitative and quantitative features of suitably normalized scaling functions of the ccf acting on a cylindrical colloid facing a homogeneous or inhomogeneous substrate are similar to the ones for a spherical colloid  @xcite .",
    "for example the scaling functions for ( + + ) bcs at the colloids and the substrate exhibit minima at @xmath39 which are , however , located closer to @xmath40 by a factor of 1.2 for spherical colloids as compared to cylindrical colloids of same radius .",
    "this quantitative difference is related to the fact that the decay rate of the scaling function of the order parameter profile for critical adsorption at colloids increases upon increasing the local curvature of the colloids  @xcite .",
    "accordingly we anticipate that our present results also capture the corresponding trends for three spherical colloids .",
    "( @xmath41 ) with their axes parallel to the @xmath34-axis , immersed in a near - critical binary liquid mixture ( not shown ) .",

    "for this situation , @xmath43 corresponds to the mixed , disordered phase of the fluid , while @xmath44 corresponds to the demixed , ordered phase .",
    "the meaning of the sign has to be reversed if one considers a lower critical point .",
    "we are interested in the ccf @xmath45 acting on colloid ( 1 ) in the presence of the colloids ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) along the @xmath37-direction .",
    "it takes the scaling form    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
