    "stochastic processes with an absorbing state arise frequently in statistical physics @xcite . in systems with spatial structure , phase transitions to an absorbing state , as exemplified by the contact process @xcite , are widely studied in connection with self - organized criticality @xcite , the transition to turbulence @xcite , and issues of universality in nonequilibrium critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "interest in such transitions should continue to grow in the wake of experimental confirmation in a liquid crystal system @xcite .",
    "this letter presents a new theoretical approach to absorbing - state phase transitions via analysis of exact ( numerical ) quasistationary ( qs ) probability distributions .",
    "the quasistationary probability distribution ( qsd ) provides a wealth of information about systems exhibiting an absorbing - state phase transition @xcite .",
    "( since the only true stationary state for a finite system is the absorbing one ,  stationary - state \" simulations in fact probe qs properties , that is , conditioned on survival . ) in particular , the order parameter and its moments , static correlation functions , and the qs lifetime are all accessible from the qsd . until now , qs properties of systems with spatial structure have been determined only via simulation @xcite ; here i develop an effective scheme for determining the qsd on rings of @xmath3 sites .",
    "the qsd is defined as follows .",
    "consider a continuous - time markov process @xmath4 with state @xmath5 absorbing : if @xmath6 , then @xmath7 at all subsequent times .",
    "the transition rates @xmath8 ( from state @xmath9 to state @xmath10 ) are such that @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "( some processes have several absorbing states , @xmath13 . )",
    "let @xmath14 denote the probability of state @xmath9 at time @xmath15 , given some initial state @xmath16 .",
    "the _ survival probability _ @xmath17 is the probability that the process has not visited the absorbing state up to time @xmath15 . we suppose that as @xmath18 the @xmath19 , normalized by the survival probability , attain a time - independent form , allowing us to define the qsd :        in principle , one could integrate the master equation numerically and extract the qsd in the long - time limit .",
    "such an approach is very time - consuming , and essentially useless for processes with a large state space .",
    "i use instead the iterative scheme demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "given some initial guess for the distribution @xmath23 , the following relation is iterated until convergence is achieved :      here @xmath25 is the probability flux ( in the master equation ) into state @xmath9 ( @xmath26 is the flux to the absorbing state , so that @xmath27 gives the lifetime of the qs state ) , and @xmath28 is the total rate of transitions out of state @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 can take any value between 0 and 1 ; in practice rapid convergence is obtained with @xmath30 .",
    "the iterative scheme is used to determine the qsd of the _ contact process _ ( cp ) on rings of @xmath3 sites . in the cp @xcite , each site @xmath31 of a lattice",
    "is either occupied ( @xmath32 ) , or vacant ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "transitions from @xmath34 to @xmath35 occur at a rate of unity , independent of the neighboring sites .",
    "the reverse transition is only possible if at least one neighbor is occupied : the transition from @xmath35 to @xmath34 occurs at rate @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the fraction of nearest neighbors of site @xmath31 that are occupied ; thus the state @xmath35 for all @xmath31 is absorbing .",
    "( @xmath38 is a control parameter governing the rate of spread of activity . )",
    "although no exact results are available , the cp has been studied intensively via series expansion and monte carlo simulation . since",
    "its scaling properties have been discussed extensively @xcite we review them only briefly here .",
    "the best estimate for the critical point in one dimension is @xmath39 , as determined via series analysis @xcite . approaching the critical point ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath40 and lifetime @xmath41 diverge , following @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the relative distance from the critical point .",
    "the order parameter ( the fraction of active sites ) , scales as @xmath44 for @xmath45 . near the critical point , finite - size scaling ( fss ) @xcite , implies that average properties such as @xmath46 depend on @xmath3 through the scaling variable @xmath47 , leading , at the critical point , to @xmath48 , with dynamic exponent @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the computational algorithm for determining the qsd consists of three components .",
    "the first ( applicable to any model having two states per site ) enumerates all configurations on a ring of @xmath3 sites .",
    "configurations differing only by a lattice translation are treated as equivalent . in subsequent stages",
    "only one representative of each equivalence class is used , yielding a considerable speedup and reduction in memory requirements .",
    "( the multiplicity , or number of configurations associated with each equivalence class , is needed for calculating observables . )",
    "the second component runs through the list of configurations , enumerating all possible transitions .",
    "here proper care must be taken to determine the weight of each transition , due to the varying multiplicity of initial and final configurations .",
    "the exit rate for each configuration @xmath9 is simply : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of occupied sites and @xmath53 the number of occupied - vacant nearest - neighbor pairs . to determine @xmath54 one enumerates , for each configuration , all transitions from some other state @xmath10 to @xmath9 .",
    "( each vacant site @xmath31 in @xmath9 implies a transition from a configuration @xmath10 , differing from @xmath9 only in that site @xmath31 is occupied ; each nearest - neighbor pair of occupied sites @xmath55 in @xmath9 implies transitions from a @xmath10 in which either @xmath31 or @xmath56 is vacant .",
    "transitions between the same pair of configurations @xmath10 and @xmath9 are grouped together , with the proper multiplicity stored in the associated weight . )",
    "the final part of the algorithm determines the qsd via the iterative procedure described above .",
    "the specific rules of the model enter only in the second stage ; extension to other models is straightforward .",
    "i determined the qsd for the contact process on rings of up to 23 sites .",
    "the number of configurations scales as @xmath57 ( for @xmath3 prime this formula is exact ) .",
    "the number of annihilation transitions is @xmath58 ( on average half the sites are occupied ) and that of creation transitions is @xmath59 .",
    "( for @xmath60 , there are 364@xmath61723 configurations , and @xmath62 transitions ; the calculation takes about 16 hours on a 3 ghz processor . )",
    "the qs order parameter @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ qsex1 ] ) , follows the anticipated trend ( i.e. , @xmath63 is a sigmoidal function ) , but does not show any clear sign of the critical point ; indeed , no such sign is expected for the small systems considered here . a precise estimate of the critical value @xmath64 can nevertheless be obtained through analysis of the moment ratios .",
    "let @xmath65 denote the @xmath66-th moment of the occupied site density , and @xmath67 .",
    "the values @xmath68 , marking the crossing of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , approach the critical value systematically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cplms ] .",
    "( @xmath68 is plotted , for convenience , versus @xmath71 as this leads to an approximately linear plot . )",
    "once preliminary estimates of @xmath68 ( with uncertainty @xmath72 ) have been obtained , i perform high - resolution studies , with @xmath73 , in the vicinity of each crossing ; precise estimates of the crossing values ( uncertainty @xmath74 ) are then obtained applying neville s algorithm @xcite to the data for @xmath75 . using the bulirsch - stoer ( bst ) extrapolation technique @xcite , the data for sizes 8 to 23 furnish @xmath76 and the critical moment ratio @xmath77 .",
    "these values compare well with the best available estimates of @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite ; the associated errors are @xmath80 0.05% , remarkably small , in light of the system sizes used .",
    "the moment ratios @xmath81 also exhibit crossings that converge to @xmath64 .",
    "more surprisingly , the product @xmath82 exhibits crossings and appears to approach a well defined limit , 1.366(1 ) , as @xmath83 at the critical point ; simulations ( @xmath84 and 2000 ) , yield 1.374(2 ) for this quantity .",
    "the reduced fourth cumulant , or kurtosis , given by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 ( the variance of the order parameter ) and @xmath87 , does not exhibit crossings but instead takes a pronounced minimum at a value @xmath88 that converges to the critical value as @xmath89 .",
    "( this property has been verified in simulations using @xmath84 , and 2000 ; departures from the minimum value are evident for @xmath90 @xcite . ) the sharpness of the minimum , as gauged by @xmath91 , appears to increase rapidly with size : @xmath92 .",
    "( this is consistent with @xmath93 , as expected from fss . ) since a negative kurtosis reflects a probability distribution that is broader at the maximum , and with shorter tails ( compared to a gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance ) , it is natural that @xmath94 should be minimum at the critical point , where fluctuations are dominant .",
    "the statistical entropy per site , @xmath95 , is plotted in fig .",
    "1 . in the large-@xmath3 limit",
    ", @xmath96 should be zero for @xmath97 , since the qsd is concentrated on a set of configurations with vanishing density .",
    "as @xmath83 , one expects @xmath98 to diverge ( as is the case for @xmath99 ) , and to attain a maximum at some @xmath100 , approaching zero as @xmath101",
    ". the numerical data are consistent with these trends .    encouraged by the good results of the moment - ratio analysis , i examine three quantities expected , on the basis of fss , to exhibit scaling at the critical point : the qs lifetime @xmath41 , the order parameter , and the derivative @xmath102 .",
    "( the latter should diverge @xmath103 . ) despite the small system sizes , these quantities indeed appear to follow power laws ( see fig . [ rhl ] ) . to obtain precise estimates of the associated exponents ,",
    "i calculate the finite difference ratios @xmath104/[\\ln l - \\ln ( l-1)]$ ] , ( and similarly for @xmath41 and @xmath105 ) .",
    "linear regression of these ratios versus @xmath106 , using the seven largest sizes , yields @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "these estimates differ by 0.06% , 0.01% , and 0.5% , respectively , from the literature values of 0.25208 , 1.5807 , and 1.0968 @xcite .",
    "thus data on qs properties of systems with 23 sites or fewer yield estimates of critical exponents to within half a percent or better !",
    "precise estimates are also found for @xmath110 and @xmath94 at the critical point : using bst extrapolation i find values of 1.5306(5 ) and -0.5015(5 ) , compared with the simulation values of 1.526(3 ) and -0.505(3 ) , respectively @xcite .    to test the robustness of this approach ,",
    "i apply it to the _ pair contact process _ ( pcp ) . in the pcp @xcite",
    ", each site is again either occupied or vacant , but all transitions involve a pair of particles occupying nearest - neighbor sites , called a _",
    "pair _ in what follows .",
    "a pair annihilates itself at rate @xmath111 , and with rate @xmath112 creates a new particle at a randomly chosen site neighboring the pair , if this site is vacant .",
    "any configuration lacking a pair of nearest - neighbor occupied sites is absorbing .",
    "simulation results @xcite place the pcp in the same universality class as the cp ( namely , that of directed percolation ) .",
    "unlike the cp , for which quite precise results have been derived via series expansions , there are no reliable predictions from series or other analytic methods .    using , as before , the parameter values associated with crossings of the moment ratio @xmath113 , i obtain ( for system sizes @xmath114 to 23 ) , the estimate @xmath115 , about 0.3% above the best available estimate of 0.077092(1 ) @xcite .",
    "the estimates @xmath116 and @xmath117 , obtained via the same procedure as used for the cp , are also in good agreement with the accepted values .",
    "analysis of the qs lifetime however , yields the unexpectedly large value @xmath118 . in fact , the finite - difference ratios @xmath119 vary erratically with @xmath3 , indicating that the result for @xmath0 is unreliable .",
    "this may be associated with the large number of absorbing configurations in the pcp ( growing exponentially with @xmath3 ) , so that the extinction rate has not reached its asymptotic limiting behavior at the system sizes considered here .",
    "extrapolation of the moment ratio at @xmath120 yields @xmath121 , and reduced fourth cumulant @xmath122 , again in good accord with the expected values .",
    "( as in the case of the cp , the value of @xmath123 at which @xmath94 takes its minimum approaches @xmath64 with increasing system size . )",
    "thus the qs properties of the pcp ( for @xmath124 ) permit one to assign the model to the directed percolation class , despite the lack of a clear result for the dynamic exponent @xmath0 .",
    "it is natural to inquire whether the qs probability distribution exhibits any simplifying features . in an equilibrium lattice gas with interactions that do not extend beyond nearest neighbors , for example",
    ", the probability of a configuration depends only on the number of particles @xmath125 and nearest - neighbor pairs @xmath126 .",
    "the the cp , by contrast , i find that the qs probability of each configuration in a given @xmath127 class is distinct ( the probabilities typically vary over an order of magnitude or more , even far from the critical point ) . in a broad sense , this is because , unlike in equilibrium , not all annihilation events possess a complementary creation event . for similar reasons , it does not appear likely that the qsd could be obtained via the maximization of the statistical entropy , subject to some simple set of constraints .    in summary ,",
    "i show that analysis of exact ( numerical ) quasistationary properties on relatively small rings yields remarkably precise results for critical properties at an absorbing - state phase transition . deriving",
    "the qs distribution involves rather modest programming and computational effort : the results reported here can be obtained in a few days on a fast microcomputer .",
    "applied to the contact process , the analysis yields most critical properties with an error well below 0.1% . for the more complicated pcp ,",
    "errors are generally @xmath128 1% .",
    "application to other absorbing - state phase transitions , including some belonging to other universality classes , is in progress",
    ". the method may also be useful in the study of metastable states , provides a valuable check on simulations , and may serve as the basis for phenomenological renormalization group approaches ."
