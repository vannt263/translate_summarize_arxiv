    "the emc effect @xcite is probably one of the topics in the interplay of nuclear and particle physics which has attracted more attention . pioneering work on fermi motion and pionic effects @xcite",
    "was followed by many different ideas like binding of the nucleons in the nucleus , multiquark cluster effects or @xmath4 rescaling ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews on the topic ) . here",
    "we shall pay attention only to conventional nuclear degrees of freedom , mesons ( @xmath5 and @xmath0 ) and nucleons .",
    "one of the interesting ideas along these lines was the effect of the nuclear binding @xcite , which , with ups and downs , has come to be accepted as , largely or at least partly , responsible for the depletion of @xmath6 in the region of the minimum .",
    "criticism on this latter works was raised in @xcite , where it was shown that the introduction of relativistic corrections in the usual nuclear nonrelativistic treatment of the binding effects resulted in a flux factor which reduced the conventional binding effects @xcite .",
    "this flux factor led to a different normalization of the spectral function which preserved the baryonic number calculated relativistically @xcite .",
    "the argument of the normalization of the baryonic number is an important one and the idea has met with followers @xcite .",
    "however , it is a prescription on how to convert the nonrelativistic nuclear wave function into a relativistic spectral function @xcite and the prescription is not shared by others @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these are not the only relativistic corrections as shown in @xcite .",
    "this issue justifies a work like the present one , where we construct from the beginning a relativistic nucleon spectral function and define everything within a field theoretical formalism which uses the nucleon propagators written in terms of this spectral function .",
    "the relativistic formalism is taken from the beginning and the baryonic number is naturally well normalized .",
    "since all the nuclear information needed is contained in the nucleon spectral function , one does not need to use ordinary nuclear wave functions , which are anyway static ( no spreading in the energy distribution , which is just concentrated in the single particle energies of the shell model ) and hence one does not need any step to introduce relativistic effects into the nonrelativistic wave functions , as done in @xcite . furthermore , the use of non static spectral functions is important .",
    "this was already seen in refs .",
    "@xcite which showed that the use of more realistic spectral functions accounting for nuclear correlations resulted in an enhancement of the binding effects .",
    "the reason is that , for a given average binding energy , the approach with a realistic spectral function leads to a larger kinetic and potential energy in absolute value than the shell model approach .",
    "the other issue that we have revisited here is the pionic contribution .",
    "large effects from the pionic cloud associated with the pion excess number in the nucleus were found in @xcite .",
    "we have taken up the idea and recalculated these effects within the many body field theoretical approach using input which has been checked in a variety of nuclear reactions testing real and virtual pions : pionic reactions @xcite , muon capture @xcite , inclusive neutrino scattering @xcite and photonuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "in addition we have also included corrections from the modification of @xmath0-meson cloud in the nucleus , in complete analogy with the pionic contribution .",
    "altogether we find that the use of the spectral function for the nucleons together with the mesonic effects can approximately account for the measured emc effect .",
    "the calculations are done using the spectral function for nucleons in nuclear matter , followed by the local density approximation .",
    "this was shown to be an excellent tool to deal with photonuclear reactions in the absence of shadowing effects @xcite .",
    "hence , a natural limit of our results is the region of shadowing , @xmath7 , where indeed there are discrepancies with the data , and other ingredients should be considered that we do not want to tackle @xcite .",
    "let us recall first the nonrelativistic nucleon propagator for a noninteracting fermi sea , which is given in momentum space by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the fermi occupation number @xmath10 for @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the nonrelativistic nucleon energy . eq .",

    "failure to realize that , and the naive substitution of @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) by @xmath23 of eq . ( 6 ) , as sometimes done , leads to erroneous results which can be off by three orders of magnitude in some cases @xcite .",
    "this gives us a warning that we should express all our magnitudes in terms of the spectral functions , not the momentum distributions .",
    "the free relativistic nucleon propagator is given by    @xmath26    where we have separated in the second member the contribution from positive and negative energy states @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 in eq .",
    "( 8) are the nucleon mass and the relativistic nucleon energy @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the ordinary spinors which we take normalized as @xmath30 .",
    "we recall that @xmath31 are functions of three momentum and they will be the only spinors which will appear in our framework .    the relativistic nucleon propagator for a noninterating fermi sea is easily derived and , by analogy to eq .",

    "( 10 ) and the nonrelativistic propagator of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is the presence of the factor @xmath35 and the projector over the space of positive energies @xmath36 , which are both unity in the nonrelativistic approximation .",
    "now we proceed to construct the relativistic propagator in the interacting fermi sea .",
    "we wish to sum the dyson series for the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 , where although not shown , one would also have other sources of nucleon selfenergies .",
    "we will write them in terms of the operator @xmath15 .",
    "it will become clear later on that we only need the imaginary part of the nucleon propagator for the positive energy states , in which case we neglect from the beginning the negative energy states ( their weight becomes negligible compared to the singular part of the positive energy propagator ) .",
    "hence , for the purpose of the present problem , the nucleon propagator needed will be    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    where we have used the fact that @xmath40 should be diagonal in spin for spin saturated matter which we only consider .    comparison of eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 3 ) shows again the differences between the relativistic and nonrelativistic propagators .",

    "( 21 ) is fulfilled at the level of 2 - 3 @xmath79 in our case , in spite of the non trivial structure of the spectral function and the integrals involved . the small numerical deviation from the right normalization",
    "is taken care by dividing by the integral of eq .",
    "( 21 ) instead of by @xmath78 in the evaluation of @xmath80 , since a similar integration weighed by the structure functions appears in the numerator , as we shall see .",
    "although one could separate the contribution of protons and neutrons in the calculation , we have only applied the results to nuclei with @xmath81 , or very close , like @xmath82 and hence , we work with the symmetric nuclear matter version .",

    "( 33 ) , which we extracted from the relativistic propagator of eq . (",

    "4 . we can save all the steps given before simply by noting the differences in the two cases :    \\i ) the bound nucleon propagator is substituted by a pion propagator . from the use of cutkosky rules we must change    @xmath164    by    @xmath165    with @xmath166 the pion propagator ( in the medium ) .",

    "37 ) does not appear now for the case of the pion .",
    "\\iv ) there are three charged states of pions .    with only these four rules we can already write    @xmath167    now there are two obvious subtractions to eq .",
    "first one should subtract the contribution from a free pion , which has nothing to do with medium effects .",
    "however , this is zero because one electron can not decay into another electron , one pion and x. then assuming the pion is dressed in the medium by exciting @xmath168 and @xmath169 as we shall do , one is left with the contributions shown in fig .",
    "now there is no problem to get a contribution since @xmath170 gets strength from @xmath171 excitation .",
    "the physical channel would correspond to @xmath172 , or equivalently @xmath173 , which is now allowed .",
    "the physical channels are easily visualized by cutting the intermediate states in the diagramas with a horizontal line and placing on shell the particles cut by the line .",
    "this is actually the essence of cutkosky rules to obtain the imaginary part of the selfenergy of a diagram .",
    "the former discussion also tells us that part of what we are calculating is already contained in the nucleon structure function . this is because we are also calculating the contribution from the pions contained in a free nucleon",
    "this has to be subtracted .",
    "this is easily done by substituting in eq .",
    "( 46 )    @xmath174    since we substract @xmath78 times the contribution from the pion cloud to the structure function of the free nucleon .",
    "in technical words , we can say that we are only considering terms with at least two @xmath171 or @xmath175 ( the most important terms ) etc . in fig . 5 ( up to pauli blocking corrections in the @xmath171 lindhard function , which are automatically included by the procedure of eq .",
    "( 47 ) ) .",
    "hence the genuine pionic contribution is given by    @xmath176    eqn .",

    "however , the strong dependence of @xmath184 on @xmath183 ( imposed by energy and momentum conservation ) does not allow that factorization , and hence a relationship of the pion excess number with the pionic contribution to the structure function can not be established .",
    "the apparent extra factor 2 which we obtain in this counting ( apart from the lorentz contraction factor , @xmath185 is obtained because one is automatically accounting for the imaginary part of the compton @xmath186 amplitude which is crossing symmetric and contains the two diagrams of fig .",

    "@xcite the absolute contribution of the pion cloud is obtained by subtracting the `` free '' parts contained in the response function of a free nucleon , as done here .",

    "for instance the @xmath169 contribution is again taken real and other approximations are done to relate some magnitudes to the pion excess number ( recall our warnings about this ) .",
    "the input which we have used for the meson nucleus interaction , @xmath363 , etc , is the one of section 6 .",
    "it has the virtue of having been tested in a large variety of reactions and we have not changed it here .",
    "this gives us much confidence about the strength of the mesonic contribution obtained here .",
    "the fact that it fills up the part of @xmath80 missed by the nucleonic contribution is certainly a welcome feature which reinforces our confidence on this mesonic model .",
    "the agreement of the results that we obtain with the experimental data can be considered rather good by comparison with results obtained with other theoretical approaches .",
    "the trend of the data is well reproduced and the remaining discrepancies are not incompatible with the intrinsic theoretical uncertainties of our model , particularly of the mesonic contribution and more specially of the @xmath0-meson cloud which is somewhat tied to the form factors and the nuclear correlation function , the fact that we divide by @xmath364 instead of @xmath365 , etc .    our results for @xmath355 in @xmath350 and @xmath351 look already very similar and",
    "we have checked that @xmath355 does not change much for heavier nuclei .",
    "obviously one should take into account that for heavier nuclei @xmath326 and our approach with symmetric nuclear matter should be less accurate .",
    "actual calculations keeping different neutron and proton densities lead to a slight decrease of the minimum of @xmath355 as @xmath366 increases @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the nucleonic and mesonic contributions to the ratio @xmath80 of the @xmath296 effect , with particular emphasis on an accurate treatment of effects shown in the past to be relevant , like binding effects , fermi motion and a dynamical ( non static ) treatment of the nucleons and the mesons in the medium .    in order to avoid having to take some prescription on how to include relativistic effects in the approach , which has led to many discussions in the past ,",
    "we started with a relativistic approach from the beginning and have made a covariant treatment which allows us to write all magnitudes in terms of nucleon and meson propagators in the medium .",
    "the approach was made practical by evaluating the relevant magnitudes in an infinite medium and calculating the structure functions in finite nuclei by means of the local density approximation .",
    "this procedure is fine for @xmath367 but certainly breaks down for @xmath368 where there is nuclear shadowing .",
    "we could see that the use of the spectral functions to construct the nucleon selfenergy was relevant in reducing somewhat the ratio @xmath80 with respect to a static picture of the nucleus , like a shell model , or in our case an uncorrelated fermi sea .",
    "this reconfirmed qualitatively earlier findings in the same direction .",
    "although our results for the nucleonic contribution differ somewhat from other results in the literature , we share their conclusions that the nucleonic contribution alone does not explain the data , particularly the slope from @xmath238 to @xmath327 .    on the other hand , we evaluated the contribution from the pion and @xmath0-meson clouds rather accurately .",
    "recent work done before on the contribution of the pion cloud to the @xmath369 nucleus selfenergy had taught us some important lessons , particularly the importance of using an input which satisfies a sum rule , not trivial to satisfy unless the analytical properties of the pion selfenergy are strictly fulfilled , and the need to avoid any relationship to the `` pion excess number '' . in addition , experience gained in dealing with reactions which involve real and virtual pions allowed us to use information on the pion nucleus selfenergy which is realistic enough and has been tested in many such reactions .",
    "hence , we consider the present calculation of the pionic effects as an improvement over work done in the past and we think these results are rather reliable . however , there are still small uncertainties in the pionic contribution stemming from different results for the pion structure function obtained in different analyses of the drell - yan process .",
    "the strength of the pionic effects is moderate .",
    "so is the one from the @xmath0-meson cloud , but , when they are added to the nucleonic contribution one obtains a good description of the data in the region of @xmath370 .    in summary",
    "we could conclude that the main features of the @xmath296 effect can be described in terms of conventional degrees of freedom , nucleons and mesons .",
    "it does not exclude explanations in terms of more elementary degrees of freedom like quarks and gluons .",
    "it is simply a question of which degrees of freedom are more economical and transparent , as stressed by jaffe in ref .",
    "the fact that we could deal with these degrees of freedom with a certain accuracy , and establish the relationship of the effects found to familiar concepts in conventional nuclear physics , makes these degrees of freedom rather appropriate to look at the @xmath296 and related effects",
