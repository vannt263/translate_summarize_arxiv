    "it is the probability of correctly distinguishing between two pure states @xmath123 by the optimal strategy @xcite .",
    "we now obtain a lower bound on the relative error of cloning of the set @xmath48 . as before ,",
    "the prior probabilities are arbitrary and constrained only by the normalization condition .",
    "like ( [ alpdel ] ) , we have the acceptable range @xmath124 according to theorem 2 , each term of sum in the right - hand side of ( [ bd7 ] ) obeys @xmath125 hence the desired bound is established as follows .",

    "if two probabilities , say , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are variable and the rest of parameters is fixed , then the bound ( [ theor4 ] ) decreases as these probabilities differ .",

    "indeed , the parameter @xmath130 characterizes an amount of prior information . if the upper limit of eq . ( [ alpdel2 ] ) is saturated for some pair @xmath57 then corresponding summands in the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ theor4 ] ) and ( [ prieq ] ) vanish .",
    "this is the case of potentially perfect cloning . on the whole ,",
    "these conclusions on a role of _ a priori _ information in the ancilla add to the stronger no - cloning theorem .",
    "a question is , whether the lower bounds ( [ theor3 ] ) and ( [ theor4 ] ) can be reached ? in general , it is not the case , though the bound by theorem 3 is least for two pure states .",
    "the quantum circuit for optimal cloning will be built in the next section .",
    "the subject matter changes for @xmath49 . from the viewpoint of minimization",
    "the bound of theorem 3 is approximate . as reasons of appendix",
    "a show , saturating the inequality ( [ rjk1 ] ) holds if and only if @xmath131 , @xmath132 for @xmath133 ( for @xmath134 the angles @xmath135 and @xmath136 should be swapped in the two equalities ) .",

    "thus , the presented limit is somewhat rough .    more rigorous way may be as follows .",
    "similar to ( [ star1 ] ) , we have arrived at the @xmath50 inequalities of a kind @xmath138 .",

    "can be rewritten in the form @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "the task is to minimize the function ( [ bdel7 ] ) in the above simplex .",
    "so we come across a difficult problem of nonlinear programming ( the simple case @xmath142 of this problem is considered in appendix a ) . for @xmath139 ,",
    "the minimized function is concave .",
    "so the problem of minimization is reduced to finding extremal points of the simplex .",
    "if the values of parameters are prescribed , the wanted minimum can be found numerically . at the same time , it is complicated to obtain an explicit formula for general case .",
    "but even if we should find it , we still would not have a complete solution to the problem of mixed - state cloning .",
    "indeed , it is not necessary that bound given by such a formula be least .",
    "so we have restricted our consideration to obtaining of the bound by theorem 3 .",
    "rough though this bound is , it has straightforward form and allows to estimate how a merit of state - dependent cloning is limited .",
    "we shall now expose the relative error in comparison with other optimality criteria . for the sake of simplicity",

    "@xcite , the maximum of the global fidelity is equal to @xmath148 according to ( [ theor33 ] ) , the minimum of the relative error is reduced to @xmath149 for @xmath112 and @xmath42 . for the absolute error",

    "but the probability is close to zero and the relative error is close to one when the number @xmath15 of actual clone is large .",

    "in contrast with the global fidelity and the absolute error , for the case ( ii ) a behaviour of relative error is crucially dependent on numbers @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "similar to the optimal probability of success , the criterion of relative error emphasizes that any cloning is not isolated stage in quantum information processing . as a rule ,",
    "the outputs of cloning machine are subjects of further operations , say , a discrimination .",
    "for example , in the cryptographic b92 scheme alice encodes the bits into two non - orthogonal pure states @xcite .",
    "so bob can apply the unambiguous discrimination @xcite .",
    "but the closer used states are to each other the larger number of discarded bits is in the total sequence . on the other hand , a sufficiently great closeness of the used states will prevent the eavesdropping . unlike both the global fidelity and absolute error ,",
    "the notion of relative error allows to take such aspects into account .",
    "we shall now build quantum circuits for the optimal relative - error cloning of two pure states @xmath143 with arbitrary prior probabilities @xmath163 ( @xmath86 ) . _ a priori _ information about actually input state is contained in the state of ancilla which is either @xmath164 or @xmath165 . without loss of generality ,",
