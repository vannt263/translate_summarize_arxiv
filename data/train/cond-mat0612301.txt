    "the study of critical phenomena and phase transitions is a major and long standing topic in statistical physics .",
    "@xcite particularly , the two - dimensional lattice - gas model  @xcite with repulsive interactions between the adparticles has received considerable theoretical and experimental interest because it provides the theoretical framework to study structural order - disorder transitions occurring in many adsorbed monolayer films .",
    "@xcite most studies have been devoted to adsorption of particles with single occupancy .",
    "the problem becomes considerably difficult when particles occupy two adjacent lattice sites ( dimers ) .",
    "consequently , there have been a few studies devoted to order - disorder transitions associated to dimer adsorption with repulsive lateral interactions . among them , the structural ordering of interacting dimers has been analyzed by a. j. phares et al .",
    "@xcite the authors calculated the entropy of dimer on semi - infinite @xmath2 square lattice ( @xmath3 ) by means of transfer matrix techniques .",
    "they concluded that there are a finite number of ordered structures . as it arose from simulation analysis ,  @xcite only two of the predicted structures survive at thermodynamic limit .",
    "in fact , in ref .  , the analysis of the phase diagram for repulsive nearest - neighbor interactions on a square lattice confirmed the presence of two well - defined structures : a @xmath4 ordered phase at @xmath5 and a  zig - zag \" ( zz ) order at @xmath6 , being @xmath7 the surface coverage .",
    "the thermodynamic implication of such a structural ordering was demonstrated through the analysis of adsorption isotherms ,  @xcite the collective diffusion coefficient  @xcite and the configurational entropy  @xcite of dimers with nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "later , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and finite - size scaling ( fss ) techniques have been used to study the critical behavior of repulsive linear @xmath8-mers in the low - coverage ordered structure ( at @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite a ( @xmath9 ) ordered phase , characterized by alternating lines , each one being a sequence of adsorbed @xmath8-mers separated by @xmath8 adjacent empty sites , was found .",
    "the critical temperature and critical exponents were calculated .",
    "the results revealed that the system does not belong to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the study was extended to triangular lattices .",
    "@xcite in this case , the exponents obtained for @xmath10 and @xmath11 are very close to those characterizing the critical behavior of @xmath8-mers ( @xmath10 ) on square lattices at @xmath5 .",
    "recently , by using mc simulations and finite - scaling techniques , rysko and borwko have studied a wide variety of systems in presence of multisite - occupancy .",
    "@xcite among them , attracting dimers in the presence of energetic heterogeneity ;  @xcite heteronuclear dimers consisting of different segments a and b adsorbed on square lattices ;  @xcite and trimers with different structures adsorbed on square lattices .",
    "@xcite in these leading papers , a rich variety of phase transitions was reported along with a detailed discussion about critical exponents and universality class .    summarizing , although there have been various studies for monolayers at half coverage , to the author s knowledge , there are no conclusive studies on the characteristics of the transition phase of repulsive dimers on a square lattice at @xmath0 coverage . in the present contribution",
    "we attempt to remedy this situation . for this purpose ,",
    "extensive mc simulations in the canonical ensemble complemented by analysis using fss techniques have been applied .",
    "the fss study has been divided in two parts .",
    "namely , @xmath12 a conventional fss in terms of the normalized scaling variable @xmath13 ,  @xcite where @xmath14 is the critical temperature ; and @xmath15 an extended fss ,  @xcite where @xmath16 , instead of @xmath17 , is used .",
    "our results led the determination of the critical temperature separating the transition between a disordered state and the zz ordered phase occurring at @xmath0 coverage and the critical exponents characterizing the phase transition .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the dimer lattice - gas model . the order parameter and the simulation scheme",
    "are introduced in secs .",
    "iii and iv , respectively .",
    "finally , the results and general conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "in this section , the lattice - gas model for dimer adsorption is described .",
    "the surface is represented as a simple square lattice in two - dimensions consisting of @xmath18 adsorptive sites , where @xmath19 is the size of the system along each axis .",
    "the homonuclear dimer is modelled as @xmath20 monomers at a fixed separation , which equals the lattice constant @xmath21 . in the adsorption process , it is assumed that each monomer occupies a single adsorption site and the admolecules adsorb or desorb as one unit , neglecting any possible dissociation .",
    "the high - frequency stretching motion along the molecular bond has not been considered here .",
    ".,width=151 ]    in order to describe the system of @xmath22 dimers adsorbed on @xmath23 sites at a given temperature @xmath24 , let us introduce the occupation variable @xmath25 which can take the following values : @xmath26 if the corresponding site is empty and @xmath27 if the site is occupied . under this consideration ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction constant which is assumed to be repulsive ( positive),@xmath30 represents pairs of nn sites and @xmath31 is the energy of adsorption of one given surface site . the term @xmath32 is subtracted in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) since the summation over all the pairs of nn sites overestimates the total energy by including @xmath22 bonds belonging to the @xmath22 adsorbed dimers .",
    "given the inherent anisotropy of the adparticles , it is convenient to define a related order parameter . in this section , we will briefly refer to a recently reported order parameter @xmath33 ,  @xcite which measures the orientation of the admolecules in the ordered structure .",
    "[ figure1 ] shows one of the possible configurations of the ordered zz structure appearing for dimers at @xmath0 monolayer .",
    "though the degeneracy of this phase is high , the entropy per lattice site tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "the figure suggests a simple way to build an order parameter .",
    "in fact , any realization of the zz structure implies the orientation of the particles along one of the lattice axis .",
    "@xcite then , all the available configurations can be grouped in two sets , according to this orientation . taking advantage of this property",
    ", we define the order parameter as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) represents the number of dimers aligned along the vertical ( horizontal ) axis and @xmath37 .",
    "when the system is disordered @xmath38 , the two orientations ( vertical or horizontal ) are equivalent and @xmath33 is zero .",
    "as the temperature is decreased below @xmath14 , the dimers align along one direction and @xmath33 is different from zero .",
    "thus , @xmath33 appears as a proper order parameter to elucidate the phase transition .",
    "the lattices were generated fulfilling the following conditions :    * the sites were arranged in a square lattice of side @xmath19 ( @xmath39 ) , with conventional periodic boundary conditions .",
    "* because the surface was assumed to be homogeneous , the interaction energy between the adsorbed dimer and the atoms of the substrate @xmath31 was neglected for sake of simplicity . * in order to maintain the lattice at @xmath0 coverage , @xmath40 , the number of dimers on the lattice was fixed as @xmath41 .",
    "* appropriate values of @xmath19 ( @xmath42 ) were used in such a way that the zz adlayer structure is not altered by boundary conditions .    in order to study the critical behavior of the system ,",
    "we have used an exchange mc method .",
    "@xcite as in ref .",
    ", we build a compound system that consists of @xmath43 noninteracting replicas of the system concerned .",
    "the @xmath44-th replica is associated with a heat bath at temperature @xmath45 [ or @xmath46 , @xmath47 being the boltzmann constant ] . to determine the set of temperatures , @xmath48 , we set the highest temperature , @xmath49 , in the high - temperature phase where relaxation ( correlation ) time is expected to be very short and there exists only one minimum in the free energy space . on the other hand , the lowest temperature , @xmath50 ,",
    "is set in the low - temperature phase whose properties we are interested in .",
    "finally , the difference between two consecutive temperatures , @xmath45 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 , is set as @xmath53 ( equally spaced temperatures ) .",
    "_ replica - update _ : interchange vacancy - particle and diffusional relaxation .",
    "the procedure is as follows : ( a ) one out of the @xmath43 replicas is randomly selected ( for example the @xmath44-th replica ) .",
    "( b ) a dimer and a pair of nearest - neighbor empty sites , both belonging to the replica chosen in ( a ) , are randomly selected and their coordinates are established .",
    "then , an attempt is made to interchange its occupancy state with probability given by the metropolis rule ,  @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the difference between the hamiltonians of the final and initial states .",
    "( c ) a dimer is randomly selected .",
    "then , a displacement is attempted ( following the metropolis scheme ) , by either jumps along the dimer axis or reptation through a @xmath56 rotation of the dimer axis , where one of the dimer centers remains in its position ( interested readers are referred to fig .   1 in ref .   for a more complete description of the reptation mechanism ) . this procedure ( diffusional relaxation )",
    "must be allowed in order to reach equilibrium in a reasonable time .",
    "_ exchange _ : exchange of two configurations @xmath57 and @xmath58 , corresponding to the @xmath44-th and @xmath59-th replicas , respectively , is tried and accepted with probability @xmath60 . in general , the probability of exchanging configurations of the @xmath44-th and @xmath59-th replicas is given by ,  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "as in ref .",
    ", we restrict the replica - exchange to the case @xmath63 .",
    "the initialization of the compound system of @xmath43 replicas , step 1 ) , is as follows . by starting with a random initial condition",
    ", the configuration of the replica @xmath65 is obtained after @xmath66 mcs@xmath67 at @xmath49 ( mcs@xmath67 consists of @xmath23 realizations of the replica - update subroutine ) .",
    "second , for @xmath68 , the configuration of the @xmath44-th replica is obtained after @xmath66 mcs@xmath67 at @xmath45 , taking as initial condition the configuration of the replica to @xmath69 .",
    "this method results more efficient than a random initialization of each replica .    the procedure 1)-4 )",
    "is repeated for all lattice sizes . for each lattice",
    ", the equilibrium state can be well reproduced after discarding the first @xmath70 mcs .",
    "then , averages are taken over @xmath71 successive mcs . as it was mentioned above , a set of equally spaced temperatures",
    "is chosen in order to accurately calculate the physical observables in the close vicinity of @xmath14 .",
    "the thermal average @xmath72 of a physical quantity @xmath73 is obtained through simple averages : @xmath74.\\ ] ] in the last equation , @xmath57 stands for the state of the @xmath44-th replica ( at temperature @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , the specific heat @xmath75 ( in @xmath47 units ) is sampled from energy fluctuations : @xmath76.\\ ] ] the quantities related with the order parameter , such as the susceptibility @xmath77 , and the reduced fourth - order cumulant @xmath78 introduced by binder ,  @xcite are calculated as : @xmath79\\ ] ] and @xmath80         finally , we will briefly refer to the specific heat exponent @xmath86 .",
    "the  roughness \" of the curves of @xmath75 prevents a direct determination of @xmath86 .",
    "however , the usual hyperscaling relations inequalities of rushbrooke , @xmath87 , and josephson , @xmath88 ( being @xmath89 the dimension of the space ) , predict a negative specific heat exponent @xmath90 .",
    "this finding is consistent with the preliminary results obtained in the present study .",
    "namely , even though the fluctuations in the energy are of the order of the statistical errors in the simulation results ( reason for which the data are not shown here ) , it is possible to observe that the maxima of the curves of the specific heat remain practically constant as @xmath19 is increased . in other words , the specific heat seems not to diverge on approaching the transition . however , the present data do not allow us to be conclusive on this point and more work is needed to clearly elucidate the specific heats behavior of the model .    in summary",
    ", we have addressed the critical properties of repulsive dimers on two - dimensional square lattices at @xmath0 coverage .",
    "the results were obtained by using exchange mc simulations and fss theory .",
    "the choice of an adequate order parameter [ as defined in eq .",

    "though it is not possible to exclude the existence of a more complex critical behavior , the results suggest that the phase transition belongs to a new universality class .                                                                                      as in the case of the @xmath92",

    "mc simulations of @xmath8-mers at equilibrium are very time consuming .",
    "consequently , the finite - size scaling study was carried out for lattice sizes up to @xmath94 , with an effort reaching almost the limits of our computational capabilities .              in this paper ,",
    "the temperature derivatives were taken by averaging the slopes of two adjacent data points as follows : @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "error bars were estimated by propagation of errors from the last equation .",
    "on the other hand , the coordinates of each maximum were calculated by fittting a three - order polynomial to a set of between 15 and 20 data points around this critical value .",
