    "given a dynamical polynomial system described by a discrete - time ( difference ) equation , the ( forward ) reachable set ( rs ) is the set of all states that can be reached from a set of initial conditions under general state constraints .",
    "this set appears in different fields such as optimal control , hybrid systems or program analysis . in general ,",
    "computing or even approximating the rs is a challenge .",
    "note that the rs is typically non - convex and non - connected , even in the case when the set of initial conditions is convex and the dynamics are linear . in this paper",
    ", we propose a characterization of the rs as the solution of an infinite - dimensional linear programming ( lp ) problem .",
    "this characterization is done by considering a hierarchy of converging convex programs through moment relaxations of the lp .",
    "doing so , one can compute tight outer approximations of the rs .",
    "such outer approximations yield invariants for the discrete - time system , which are sets where systems trajectories are confined .",
    "this general methodology is deeply inspired from previous research efforts .",
    "the idea of formulation relying on lp optimization over probability measures appears in  @xcite , with a hierarchy of semidefinite programs ( sdp ) also called moment - sum - of - squares or sometimes lasserre hierarchy , whose optimal values converge from below to the infimum of a multivariate polynomial .",
    "one can see outer approximations of sets as the analogue of lower approximations of real - valued functions . in  @xcite , the authors leverage on these techniques to address the problem of computing outer approximations by single polynomial super level sets of basic compact semialgebraic sets described by the intersection of a finite number of given polynomial super level sets .",
    "further work focused on approximating semialgebraic sets for which such a description is not explicitly known or difficult to compute : in  @xcite , the author derives converging outer approximations of sets defined with existential quantifiers ; in  @xcite , the authors approximate the image of a compact semialgebraic set under a polynomial map .",
    "the current study can be seen as an extension of  @xcite where instead of considering only one iteration of the map , we consider infinitely many iterations starting from a set of initial conditions .    this methodology has also been successfully applied for several problems arising in the context of polynomial systems control .",
    "similar convergent hierarchies appear in  @xcite , where the authors approximate the region of attraction ( roa ) of a controlled polynomial system subject to compact semialgebraic constraints in continuous time .",
    "note that the roa is not a semialgebraic set in general .",
    "the authors of  @xcite build upon the infinite - dimensional lp formulation of the roa problem while providing a similar framework to characterize the maximum controlled invariant ( mci ) for discrete and continuous time polynomial dynamical systems . the framework used for roa and mci computation",
    "both rely on occupation measures .",
    "these allow to measure the time spent by solutions of differential or difference equations . as solutions of a linear transport equation called the liouville equation",
    ", occupation measures also capture the evolution of the semialgebraic set describing the initial conditions .",
    "as mentioned in  @xcite , the problem of characterizing the ( forward ) rs in a continuous setting and finite horizon could be done as roa computation by using a time - reversal argument . in the present study",
    ", we handle the problem in a discrete setting and infinite horizon .",
    "our contribution follows a similar approach but requires to describe the solution set of another liouville equation .",
    "computing or approximating rs has been a topic of intensive research in the last four decades . when the dynamics of the discrete - time system is linear",
    ", one can rely on contractive algorithms based on finite lp relaxations combined with polyhedral projections  @xcite . for more details and historical surveys , we refer the interested reader to  @xcite .",
    "a recent approach  @xcite has extended the scope of problems for which one can construct polyhedral bounds on the reachable set .",
    "again , the method relies on ( parametric ) lp and numerical integration procedures .",
    "the works  @xcite compares approaches combining lp relaxations with bernstein decompositions or krivine / handelman representations of nonnegative polynomials ( also based on sums of squares certificates ) . see also  @xcite using template polyhedra and bernstein form of polynomials .",
    "however , all these methods based on linear relaxations often fail to construct tight bounds since they build convex over approximations of possibly nonconvex sets .",
    "furthermore , they usually do not provide convergence guarantees .",
    "in contrast with previous work , our contributions are the following :    * we rely on a infinite - dimensional lp formulation to handle the general discrete - time rs problem under semialgebraic state and initial conditions ; * we build a hierarchy of finite - dimensional sdp relaxations for this infinite - dimensional lp problem . under additional assumptions , the optimal value of this lp is the volume of the rs , whose optimum is the restriction of the lebesgue measure on the rs ; * we use the solutions of these sdp relaxations to approximate the rs as closely as desired , with a sequence of certified outer approximations defined as ( possibly nonconvex ) polynomial super level sets , which is less restrictive than linear or convex approximations used in the literature ( such as polyhedra or ellipsoids ) .    in the sequel",
    ", we focus on computation of semidefinite approximations of the forward rs for discrete - time polynomial systems .",
    "the problem statement is formalized in section  [ sec : pb ] and reformulated in section  [ sec : inflp ] into a primal optimization problem over probability measures satisfying liouville s equation .",
    "we explain how to obtain the dual problem in section  [ sec : duallp ] .",
    "then , we show in section  [ sec : sdp ] how to solve in practice the primal problem with moment relaxations , as well as the dual with sums of squares strenghtenings . in both cases , this boils down to solving a hierarchy of finite - dimensional sdp problems .",
    "we illustrate the method with several numerical experiments in section  [ sec : bench ] .",
