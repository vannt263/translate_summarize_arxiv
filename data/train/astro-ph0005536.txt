    "clusters of galaxies are the largest virialized structures observed in the universe . since they arise from exceptionally high peaks of the primordial fluctuation density field , their properties are highly sensitive to the nature of such cosmic fluctuations .",

    "@xcite ; borgani et al .",
    "@xcite ) is a powerful tool to constrain cosmological models for the formation and evolution of cosmic structures .",
    "moreover , clusters are useful laboratories for testing models of galaxy evolution .",
    "while early - type galaxies only show evidence for passive evolution ( e.g. stanford et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the fraction of blue galaxies increases significantly with redshift ( butcher & oemler @xcite ) , at least up to @xmath3 , and the fraction of s0 s decreases ( dressler et al .",
    "@xcite ) . it is therefore essential to have reliable cluster catalogues over the largest possible redshift range .",
    "most distant clusters , at @xmath4 , have so far been identified through optical follow - ups of x - ray selected clusters ( see , e.g. gioia et al . @xcite and rosati et al .",

    "@xcite ) . in the 90 s",
    "a large catalogue of objectively selected distant clusters , identified in the optical , became available ( postman et al .",
    "these last clusters are identified using a matched - filter algorithm using both positional and photometric data . in brief , this algorithm filters a galaxy catalogue to remove fluctuations in the projected distribution of galaxies that are not likely to be galaxy clusters . for this purpose , the filter is built around parametrizations of the spatial distribution and luminosity function of cluster galaxies .",
    "this algorithm also provides an estimate of the redshift for each candidate cluster ( hereafter we refer to the matched - filter estimated redshift as @xmath6 ) .",
    "currently , @xmath7 pdcs clusters have been confirmed spectroscopically , most of them at @xmath8 ( holden et al .",

    "the estimated redshifts for eis clusters span the range @xmath10 , with a median redshift @xmath11 .",
    "several eis cluster candidates have been confirmed so far , most at @xmath8 , either from the existence of the red sequence of cluster ellipticals / s0 s in colour - magnitude diagrams ( olsen et al .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the eis cluster catalogue is the largest optically selected cluster sample currently available in the southern hemisphere to this depth .",
    "this catalogue constitutes an obvious reference for follow - up observations at the eso vlt aimed at determining the structure and dynamics of distant clusters , as well as the spectroscopic properties of their member galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , little is currently known on the performance of the matched filter algorithm in detecting real clusters at @xmath4 . as we already pointed out ,",
    "most confirmed pdcs and eis clusters have redshifts @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , to point blindly at eis cluster candidates would make for an inefficient use of vlt time , because we expect several of these candidate clusters not to be real , in particular at @xmath12 .",
    "the aim of our investigation is twofold : we want to confirm as many eis clusters as possible , in order to build a reliable sample of distant clusters with well determined redshift , and , at the same time , evaluate the performance of the matched filter algorithm in the detection of high - redshift clusters . in order to achieve this purpose ,",
    "we use two independent methods : ( 1 ) multi - object spectroscopic observations of eis cluster candidates in the redshift range @xmath13 , and ( 2 ) the detection of the colour - magnitude sequences traced by early - type galaxies through multi - colour optical and near - ir photometry of the most distant eis cluster candidates ( scodeggio et al .",

    "the detection of galaxy concentrations close to the estimated redshifts of three eis clusters supports the reliability of the matched - filter redshift estimates .",

    ", we note that the low-@xmath28 set of galaxies , 3a , detected in the field of eis0950 - 2154 is somewhat off - centered with respect to the nominal eis cluster center ( see fig .  [ f - m3 ] ) .",
    "the same is not true for the sets with @xmath29 in the fields of eis0540 - 2418 , eis0955 - 2113 , and eis0956 - 2009 .",
    "this fact suggests that the set 3a does not correspond to the eis cluster , but is a foreground group .",

    "in this sect . we assign likelihoods to the 19 sets of galaxies which have been identified in the previous sect . if @xmath31 is the incompleteness of our redshift sample in the magnitude interval @xmath32 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ f - sf ] ) , then the redshift distribution reads @xmath33 \\ ; s(m ) \\ ; dm,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the volume element at the redshift @xmath28 and @xmath35 $ ] is the luminosity function ( lf hereafter ) .",
    "we take the lf in the @xmath36 band given by postman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and convert it to our @xmath37 band , using the postman et al .",
    "transformation procedure .",
    "our reference lf has therefore a schechter ( @xcite ) form with parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 . we also assume negligible evolution of the lf out to @xmath40 ( see lilly et al . @xcite and lin et al .",
    "our lf then depends on @xmath28 only through the evolution of the stellar populations and the k - correction , that we take from poggianti ( @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ f - nz ] , we plot @xmath41 , computed according to eq .  1 ,",
    "along with the observed @xmath28-distribution . based on the estimated @xmath41",
    ", we find that 16 out of 19 sets correspond to significant overdensities in redshift space , with a probability @xmath42  % .",
    ".  1 provides @xmath41 for a uniform galaxy distribution , these probabilities do not include the effect of large scale clustering ( see , e.g. , zaritsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to account for the large scale clustering , and following the approach by holden et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we modulate @xmath41 with the redshift distribution derived from the cfrs assuming our selection function , @xmath31 .",
    "we first convert the cfrs @xmath43 magnitudes to the @xmath37 system ( see lilly et al .",
    "we then extract 50000 galaxies from the cfrs , with a bootstrap sampling , adopting the magnitude distribution of our sample ( see fig .",
    "[ f - md ] ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the bootstrapped cfrs and our data - set have similar redshift distributions .",
    "this is expected since magnitude selection is the main process leading to the inclusion of galaxies in the sample .",
    "we extract random subsamples of 11 galaxies from the bootstrapped cfrs reference sample ( 11 is the mean number of galaxies with redshift in our eis cluster fields ) . using the same procedure described in sect .",
    "[ s - zsys ] , we identify sets of galaxies within these subsamples , and compute their probabilities relative to the uniform redshift distribution @xmath41 given by eq .  1 . in this way",
    "we construct a distribution of probabilities to detect a real system within a galaxy sample which includes large - scale clustering , but not galaxy clusters .",
    "we finally obtain the likelihoods of the 19 observed sets , by comparing their original @xmath41-based probabilities to the distribution of probabilities for the random sets .",
    "these 19 likelihoods are listed in table  [ t - cs ] .",
    "we find that four of our 19 sets have a likelihood @xmath1  % ; all of them have at least three galaxy members .",
    "the four sets are flagged in the last column of table  [ t - cs ] .",
    "we refer to these four sets as the real systems hereafter .",
    "as expected , many of the sets with a significant overdensity with respect to the uniform redshift distribution are no longer significant when compared to a redshift distribution which includes the large scale clustering .",
    "our results are robust against modifications of the adopted lf ( we change @xmath44 by @xmath45 , and @xmath46 by @xmath47 mag ) , and of the galaxy - type for which the evolutionary- and k - corrections are computed . furthermore , we verify that varying cosmological parameters ( h@xmath17 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) within conservative ranges , only induces marginal changes in the system likelihoods .",
    "finally , we also checked that narrowing the @xmath50 range used to define the redshift - sets , from 0.015 to 0.010 , hardly modifies the membership and likelihoods of the sets .",
    "we obtain 67 new redshifts for galaxies in six eis candidate cluster fields . based on these data ,",
    "we establish the existence of real systems in redshift space in the direction of four of these candidate clusters .",
    "the reality of the systems is established at @xmath15  % confidence level , and in two cases , at @xmath51  % .",
    "the redshift overdensities , coupled with the 2-d overdensities detected by the use of the matched - filter algorithm , strongly supports the reality of four of the six examined eis clusters .",
    "these 4 clusters add to the other two spectroscopically confirmed eis clusters ( da  costa et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "two of the four @xmath28-systems have a median redshift in good agreement with the matched - filter estimate for the eis cluster redshift ( @xmath52 median@xmath53 ) .",
    "the other two have significantly lower redshifts ( median@xmath54 , 0.236 vs. @xmath11 ) .    taken at face value , these results suggest that , in several cases , the matched - filter algorithm over - estimates the mean cluster redshift by a large amount .",
    "however , it is quite possible that in some cases we have not detected the eis cluster , but a foreground galaxy system projected along the same line - of - sight of the cluster .",
    "similarly , it is difficult to conclude about the reality of the eis clusters where we do not detect any real redshift system .    in particular",
    ", we note that in the field of eis0540 - 2418 we have a marginal detection ( 92  % probability ) of the galaxy set 2d at median@xmath55 ( see table  [ t - cs ] ) , in fair agreement with the matched - filter estimate of the cluster redshift , @xmath25 .",
    "we also note that the cluster eis0533 - 2353 has @xmath56 , larger than any of our galaxy sets .",
    "this suggests that it could have escaped detection because our observations were not deep enough .",
    "in fact , da  costa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that all our six eis cluster candidates could be real , based on the analysis of the colour - magnitude diagrams for galaxies in the cluster fields .",
    "we conclude that our spectroscopic confirmation rate must be considered as a lower limit .",
    "if at least one third of the eis clusters in the redshift range sampled by our observations are real , there are more than 25 eis clusters with @xmath6 in the range 0.50.7 .",
    "this sample is large enough for the derivation of the properties of clusters at intermediate to high redshifts .",
    "optical selection of clusters of galaxies at high redshifts is a necessary complementary approach to x - ray selection .",
    "while x - ray selection tends to detect only rich abell - like clusters , optically selected cluster samples contain a large number of poor clusters .",
    "in fact , the space density of pdcs clusters is five times higher than that of rich abell clusters ( holden et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and very few pdcs clusters are x - ray bright ( holden et al .",
    "@xcite ) . consistently ,",
    "the velocity dispersions of our two systems with @xmath57 galaxy redshifts ( system 4c , at @xmath58 and system 6c , at @xmath26 , see table  [ t - cs ] ) are @xmath59  km  s@xmath18 , typical of low - richness clusters ( @xmath60 , see girardi et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    with the current and near - future ground - based facilities for wide - field optical and near - infrared imaging",
    ", we can expect a rapid increase in the samples of optically selected clusters .",
    "currently , our spectroscopic sample only comprises @xmath61  % of all the clusters in the two patches c and d , and in the ( estimated ) redshift range 0.50.7 .",
    "we plan to extend our sample in forthcoming observing runs . confirmed eis clusters at high redshift will be the natural targets of vlt observations aimed at determining their dynamical properties ."
