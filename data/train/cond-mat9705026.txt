    "the quantum - monte - carlo - algorithms ( qmc ) are a well established tool in theoretical many particle physics @xcite @xcite .",
    "they have been successfully used to investigate the spin and charge degrees of freedom for the attractive and repulsive hubbard model @xcite .",
    "there are several kinds of qmc algorithms .",
    "we focus here on the projector quantum - monte - carlo - algorithm ( pqmc ) @xcite . in the case of the repulsive hubbard model ( rhm )",
    "the sign problem severely restricts the parameter space one can calculate .",
    "one goal of this paper is to show , what parameters of the rhm can be calculated using state of the art qmc - methods and which of the observables still give meaningful results when a sign problem occurs .",
    "concerning the minus sign free attractive hubbard model ( ahm ) we also want to distinguish numerical instabilities and convergence problems from well-``behaved '' runs .    inspired by results of de raedt et al .",
    "@xcite for the heisenberg model we additionally investigate whether the choice of the elementary move in the monte - carlo procedure will have influence on the results .",
    "we show that exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite , the stochastic diagonalization(sd )  @xcite and pqmc  @xcite give consistent results for a broad range of the simulated parameters .",
    "in our paper we investigated a modified version of the hubbard model the @xmath0-@xmath1-hubbard model that is defined on a square lattice by the hamiltonian : @xmath2 the number operator @xmath3 and the fermion creation operator @xmath4 are defined as the ones with spin @xmath5 at site @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath5 is the summation of spin up and spin down particles .",
    "the summation with respect to @xmath7 is over the nearest neighbor pairs , whereas the summation with respect to @xmath8 is over the next nearest neighboring pairs .",
    "taking @xmath9 reproduces the usual single band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath10 is taken as the energy unit throughout this paper .",
    "a basic technique to determine the ground state properties is the exact diagonalization .",
    "here one writes the quantum problem as a eigenproblem @xmath11 and searches for the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector ( eigenstate ) of the hamilton - operator @xmath12 .",
    "we use for this paper the well known lanczos - method @xcite .    as basis states for the matrix - formalism of the hamiltonian we use plane waves , i.e.  we take basis - states @xmath13 of the form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the vacuum state . to reduce the amount of the basis states we apply the translation symmetry , and restrict the calculation to the subspace where the total momentum @xmath16 . as initial - vector for the lanczos - procedure",
    "we use a random vector with the norm 1 .    as lanczos iteration",
    "we use @xcite : @xmath17    with @xmath18 being the lanczos - vector in the @xmath19-th iteration .",
    "the limitation of the exact diagonalization is the amount of memory that is dramatically increasing with increasing system - size . for a lattice with @xmath20 points and @xmath21 particles with spin up and @xmath22 particles with spin down the hilbert - space has the dimension @xmath23 : @xmath24 this means , that a system with @xmath25 lattice - points and @xmath26 electrons per spin has the dimension @xmath27 and can be solved with the lanczos - method on state of the art computers .",
    "but a system with @xmath28 and @xmath29 electrons per spin direction has @xmath30 and can not be solved by exact diagonalization with computer systems avaible today .",
    "one method that circumvents some of these limitations is the stochastic diagonalization method .      for",
    "the stochastic diagonalization one also writes the physical quantum problem as an eigenproblem to extract the ground state properties .",
    "but one does not use all basis - states@xcite . from the view of memory consumption it would be possible to handle all system - sizes with this technique . but due to a dramatic growth of the cpu - consumption with system - size it is so far only possible to determine the hubbard - model for systems up to @xmath31 sites for small and intermediate interactions .    sketching the basic ideas of the algorithm we consider @xmath32 basis - states , which are orthonormal .",
    "the matrix ( hamiltonian ) for these @xmath32 basis - states is then denoted as @xmath33 .",
    "the problem is to find the eigenvalues @xmath34 .",
    "it is assumed , that they are ordered : @xmath35 .",
    "they can be obtained from @xmath33 with an unitary transformation @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues @xmath39 .",
    "there are several standard algorithms for obtaining this unitary transformation . in the classical jacobi algorithm @xcite for example",
    "the transformation @xmath36 is a product of plane rotations @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 each plane rotation annihilates two off - diagonal elements @xmath42 and @xmath43 , but also zeros in the off - diagonal elements can become nonzero after a rotation .",
    "only the sum over all off - diagonal elements converges to zero .",
    "this means that , it is very important for the convergence , in which order the rotations are performed .",
    "usually one always annihilates the largest off - diagonal element in the following step .",
    "it is impossible to perform the infinite number of plane rotations in equation [ equni ] with a computer , which is necessary for the exact diagonalization of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore one only performs so many plane rotations , until the absolute value of the largest off - diagonal matrix elements is smaller than a threshold @xmath44 .    in the modified jacobi scheme @xcite one only computes the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath33 i.e.  one keeps @xmath45 to be @xmath46 .",
    "this has the advantage , that it is not necessary to store the whole matrix and to make less rotations .",
    "one can prove @xcite that the diagonal - element @xmath47 is the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath33 , if the rotations are performed as described in @xcite .    a short description of the algorithm is given by :    1 .",
    "choose one basis state as an initialization .",
    "2 .   generate a set of new trial - states .",
    "search the best trial - state for expanding the ( @xmath48)-matrix to an @xmath49-matrix .",
    "the best trial - state , is the state , for which the energy reduction @xmath50 with the unitary transformation @xmath51 is the largest .",
    "if the reduction @xmath50 of the best state is bigger than a threshold @xmath52 , than this best state is added to the matrix and we apply plane rotations @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) to the matrix @xmath55 until the size of all off - diagonal elements @xmath56 with @xmath57 is smaller than a given threshold @xmath44 .",
    "5 .   if the reduction @xmath50 of the best trial - state is smaller than the threshold @xmath52 reduce the threshold @xmath52 .",
    "6 .   if the convergence criteria are satisfied stop the iterations",
    "goto step 2 .",
    "one problem of the algorithm is : what are good convergence criteria ?",
    "one is the convergence of the ground state energy @xmath58 ( the smallest eigenvalue of the matrices @xmath33 ) with increasing number of states @xmath32 .",
    "others are the convergence of the physical properties one is interested in , like correlation - functions .",
    "an additional good criterion for the convergence of the algorithm is the norm @xmath59 of the first column of the matrix @xmath60 : @xmath61      the qmc - algorithm used in this paper to investigate the ground state properties of the hubbard model is the projector - quantum - monte - carlo ( pqmc ) algorithm .",
    "the basic idea of this algorithm is to use a projection operator @xmath62 to extract the ground state @xmath63 of the hamiltonian @xmath12 from the trial wave function @xmath64 @xcite : @xmath65 the trial wave function @xmath64 is chosen to be a slater determinant .",
    "sorella et al .",
    "@xcite have developed a stable algorithm for this purpose .",
    "we give a short description to introduce the notation .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ glei1 ] ) then reads as : @xmath66    using the trotter - suzuki formula @xcite the exponential of the hubbard hamiltonian is rewritten as : @xmath67    for the interaction term @xmath68 we introduce the discrete hubbard stratonovich transformation @xcite to eliminate the quartic term as :    @xmath69    where the following definitions have been used : @xmath70 and @xmath71    the elements of the discrete hubbard stratonovich field @xmath5 can only take the values @xmath72 .",
    "the hubbard stratonovich field is often referred to as ising - spins or @xmath5-spins .",
    "the projection of the ground state then reads as :    @xmath73    the expectation value of an observable @xmath74 in the ground state is now given by :    @xmath75    normalizing the expectation value @xmath76 with @xmath77 and using the following definitions @xmath78 the expectation value reads as : @xmath79    the sum over @xmath80 is now calculated by an importance sampling monte - carlo procedure .",
    "the algorithm can be sketched in the following way :    1 .",
    "create a new configuration @xmath81 from the old configuration @xmath82 by an elementary move .",
    "2 .   calculate the transition probability @xmath83 3 .",
    "calculate a random number @xmath84 between 0 and 1 4 .",
    "if @xmath85 accept the new configuration @xmath81 else keep the old configuration @xmath86 5 .   with this procedure one",
    "generates the monte carlo configurations with the probability @xmath87 . the expectation value of an observable @xmath74 is then given by : @xmath88 with the average sign @xmath89 : @xmath90    in order to use the determinant @xmath77 as a probability one has to take the absolute value .",
    "the sign of this determinant then becomes part of the expectation value which causes the so called minus - sign problem .",
    "we implemented three different kinds of elementary moves , acting on the @xmath91 array of the @xmath5-configurations ( @xmath5-spins ) , where @xmath92 is the system - size and @xmath93 the number of trotter slices .",
    "we are motivated by results obtained for qmc - simulations of the spin @xmath94 heisenberg model where evidence was presented that the elementary move influences the convergence of the algorithms and can even lead to wrong results @xcite .    1 .",
    "the cluster move flips a certain number @xmath95 of randomly chosen @xmath5-spins .",
    "the criteria for the choice of the number @xmath95 was , that the acceptance rate of these moves was at least 40% .",
    "the slice move flips a certain number @xmath95 of randomly chosen @xmath5-spins only on a single trotter slice . by visiting the slices in consecutive order and storing intermediate results of the calculation",
    "the amount of computations can be reduced significantly .",
    "details of the implementation will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the single spin elementary move only flips one randomly chosen single @xmath5-spin .",
    "this allows a significant simplification of the algorithm @xcite .    for the efficient implementation of the algorithm",
    "the elementary move is more than a minor detail and the execution time depends significantly on the choice of the elementary move  @xcite .",
    "qmc simulations of the hubbard model are in general very time consuming .",
    "the calculations were carried out on a parallel computer .",
    "details of the parallelized algorithm have already been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally we define two important quantities , the monte - carlo steps and the error bars in the qmc algorithm .",
    "one monte carlo step ( mcs ) is completed when the program has tried to flip all @xmath96 @xmath5-spins ( @xmath92 is the size of the lattice and @xmath93 is the number of trotterslices ) .    if after one run through the lattice the acceptance rate is too low , additional runs are performed until the acceptance rate is reached .",
    "second the error bars are taken over bins , i.e. typically 50 measurements are sampled in one average @xmath97 .",
    "the error bar is now calculated as the fluctuations of these averages @xmath97 .",
    "as a check whether the different programs are correct we compare different observables .",
    "the definitions of these observables will be presented in this section .",
    "the observable commonly used for the check of a correct ground state determined with a method is the ground state energy per lattice site @xmath98 .    a common way to study superconductivity in the hubbard model is to examine the two particle correlation functions for the occurrence of off diagonal long range order ( odlro ) in the model @xcite . in order to do this",
    "we calculate the full correlation function with d@xmath99 symmetry @xcite @xmath100 that measures superconducting correlations as a function of lattice vector @xmath101 .",
    "the phase factors @xmath102 are @xmath46 in @xmath103-direction and @xmath104 in @xmath105-direction .",
    "the sum over @xmath6 goes over the whole lattice .",
    "the sums with respect to @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the independent sums over the nearest neighbors of @xmath6 .    when studying the superconducting properties of small hubbard - clusters the full correlation function is not a very appropriate measure as this expectation value also contains contributions from the one - particle greens functions @xmath108 . in principle",
    "these one particle contributions can be neglected as they decrease to zero with increasing distance @xmath109 .",
    "but when studying small clusters their influence on the results has to be taken into account  @xcite",
    ". therefore we study the vertex correlation function @xmath110",
    "in this section we compare the results obtained with ed , sd and pqmc . we restrict ourselves to the case of the @xmath111 system .",
    "this is the largest square lattice that can be solved with the exact diagonalization .",
    "the goal is to check the correct convergence of the qmc - algorithms . by this we mean for the pqmc , that we check , whether the monte carlo procedure converges correctly and whether the projection parameter @xmath112 and the trotter decomposition @xmath93 are chosen sufficiently large to obtain the true ground state .",
    "special emphasis lies on various technical problems that come with the application of the qmc method as there are the minus sign problem , numerical instabilities and statistical fluctuations . in the case of the sd we investigate whether the number of basis states accumulated is sufficient to be a good approximation of the `` true '' ground state .    inspired by the results for the rhm @xcite for larger lattice sizes",
    "we first turn our attention to the rhm .",
    "the most common indicator for reaching the ground state is the ground state energy per lattice site @xmath98 . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] we present a comparison of the ground state energies of the ed , sd and the three different implementations of the pqmc - algorithm ( section ii.c ) .",
    "the error bars on the qmc results can be estimated to be @xmath113% .",
    "the result of ed , sd and qmc are the same within these error bounds .",
    "we find excellent agreement between these different methods for the ground state energy even when a minus sign problem is present in the calculations .",
    "this can be seen from table  [ tab3 ] where we list the average sign ( @xmath89 , eq .",
    "[ eqsign ] ) for the simulations presented in table  [ tab1 ] and  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the @xmath89 has the same value in all three pqmc - algorithms we used .",
    "the sd method gives in contrast to the pqmc algorithm an upper bound for the exact ground state energy @xmath114 .",
    "therefore comparing two energies obtained with sd it is clear , that the lower energy is closer to the exact energy . for the pqmc",
    "the error bar gives a bound for the ground state energy , but it is not possible to deduce from the pqmc value whether the energy is above or below the exact energy .    it has turned out that comparing ground state energies is not a very sensitive indicator whether the pqmc has reached the true ground state  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "our interest lies on the expectation values of the superconducting correlation function for the rhm in the @xmath115-channel .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we present the comparison of @xmath116 ( eq .  [ eqfull ] ) for five different methods namely the ed , sd , single - pqmc , slice - pqmc and cluster - pqmc . for a @xmath111 hubbard system with @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    "respectively we observe perfect agreement of all five programs .",
    "the points for all five methods fall on identical positions and can not be distinguished .    as we outlined in the previous section",
    "the more appropriate indicator for the existence of odlro in small clusters is the vertex correlation function @xmath123 ( eq .  [ eqvertex ] ) .",
    "the absolute values of this vertex correlation function compared to the full correlation function turned out to be very small for the rhm  @xcite giving rise to the question whether these small results might be artifacts of the various problems that come with the application of the qmc - method .    in figure  [ fig2 ] a - d",
    "we present a systematic investigation of the @xmath111-system with @xmath124 electrons for various values of @xmath125 .",
    "in contrast to the case of the full correlation function @xmath116 we observe that in the case of the vertex correlation function @xmath126 ( eq .  [ eqvertex ] ) only simulations with @xmath119 and @xmath127 show again a perfect agreement . for larger interactions @xmath128 and @xmath129 we find strong fluctuations of the different pqmc methods coinciding with the occurrence of a minus sign problem in the simulations ( table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "thus we have shown that whereas the ground state energy and the full correlation function seem perfectly converged this is no proof that the vertex correlation function is converged in these runs .",
    "the fluctuations in the correlation functions have increased dramatically with interaction @xmath125 despite the significant higher number of mcs , as shown in table [ tabmcspos ] .",
    "we now turn our attention to the ahm .",
    "here we consider both the cluster and the single spin dynamics in the pqmc algorithm .",
    "the ahm shows superconductivity in the on - site s - wave channel . in this case",
    "there is no summation over the nearest neighbors , i.e.  no sum with respect to @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the eq .",
    "[ eqfull ] and [ eqvertex ] .",
    "of course the phasefactors @xmath130 are equal 1 .",
    "first we compare the ground state energy for pqmc with ed and sd ( table [ tab5 ] ) .",
    "note that for the sd deviations from the ed values develop with increasing interaction strength @xmath131 . for interactions @xmath132 and @xmath133 the sd algorithm has convergence problems .",
    "for these high values of @xmath131 the k - space representation of the basis states is no longer appropriate .",
    "this can be seen from figure [ figweights ] .",
    "the sd algorithm is able to find almost every important state ( i.e.  all states with a large weight ) for the interaction @xmath134 . in the interval @xmath135 to @xmath136 there are @xmath137 states in the ground state of the exact diagonalization .",
    "@xmath138 states are in the same interval in the basis of important states of the sd . for @xmath134 the sd",
    "has collected almost every state with a weight larger than @xmath139 .    the number of states with a relatively large weight increases for stronger interactions @xmath131 . in the interval @xmath140 to @xmath141 the number of states in the ground state of the exact diagonalization goes from @xmath142 ( @xmath134 ) to @xmath143 ( @xmath133 ) ( fig . [ figweights ] )",
    ". therefore more states are necessary as a good approximation of the ground state in the sd .",
    "these convergence problems can be demonstrated even clearer in table [ tabstates ] .",
    "this table shows additionally to the number of states @xmath144 in the basis of the sd ( plotted in fig .  [ figweights ] ) the norm @xmath145 of the first column ( eq .",
    "[ eqnorm ] ) and the threshold @xmath52 for the acceptance of new states . because the cpu - time is limited @xcite , @xcite in practice the number of states @xmath144 can not exceed to some hundred thousand . from table",
    "[ tabstates ] one can see , that @xmath144 and @xmath145 as well as @xmath52 are increasing with @xmath131 . for practical purposes",
    "the sd is not able to find a good approximation of the exact ground state beyond a certain interaction .",
    "we were not able to resolve these problems by the use of a real space representation of the basis states @xcite .    as a second step",
    "we compare the superconducting correlation function with on - site s - wave symmetry for the ahm .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows @xmath146 and [ fig4 ] shows @xmath147 for @xmath134 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 for a @xmath151 system with @xmath152 .",
    "the comparison of the vertex correlation function with the lanczos method clearly indicates that for @xmath132 and especially for @xmath133 the cluster program shows deviations from the ed values .",
    "these deviations are comparable to the case of the rhm , where we also observe convergence problems for increasing interaction @xmath125 .",
    "we tried to find out where these convergence problems might come from . on the one hand we investigated the dependence on the projection paramter @xmath112 . in figure [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ]",
    "we show the dependence of the cumulated plateau of the vertex correlation function @xmath147 and of the ground state energy per site @xmath98 of the projection parameter @xmath112 .",
    "it clearly indicates that a projection parameter of @xmath153 as it was used throughout the rest of the paper is sufficient to reach the ground state .",
    "note that especially the ground state energy does not depend very strongly on the projection parameter .",
    "furthermore we investigated whether numerical instabilities might cause the convergence problems . in table",
    "[ tab10 ] we compare the ground state energy for different numbers of stabilizations @xmath154 .",
    "to reduce numerical instabilities the product of @xmath93 imaginary time slices is being stabilized by a modified gram - schmidt orthogonalization @xcite .",
    "a stabilization is performed every @xmath154 slices of the trotter decomposition .",
    "the results agree perfectly so we conclude that the simulations were numerically stable .",
    "finally we checked whether the mc process depends on the starting seed of the random number generator .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the ground state energy for different seeds . here",
    "we also can not discover any unusual behaviour .    thus even in the absence of a minus sign problem for the ahm the pqmc algorithms have convergence problems .",
    "an even more striking result is seen comparing table [ tabmcspos ] and [ tabmcs ] .",
    "the number of mcs needed for convergence both in the rhm as well as in the ahm increase with interaction strength @xmath131 for both the single and the cluster algorithm in the same manner . as a comparison",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the results for unconverged runs .",
    "the corresponding number of mcs ( pqmc ) and number of basis state ( sd ) are listed in table [ tabmcsunconverg ] .",
    "given only limited cpu power , we come to the result , that even when there is no minus sign problem as for the example in the case of the pqmc algorithm for the attractive hubbard model or of the sd the presented numerical algorithms can not handle values of @xmath125 beyond a critical interaction , because of convergence problems .",
    "we presented a detailed comparison of the results of exact diagonalization , stochastic diagonalization and the pqmc .",
    "for the pqmc we implemented three different elementary moves , namely the single spin flip move , the slice move and the cluster move .",
    "we showed that there is perfect agreement between all five methods for the ground state energies and the full correlation function for the rhm and the ahm .",
    "also for the vertex correlation functions , that are very small in magnitude in the repulsive case , the exact diagonalization results can be confirmed by pqmc and stochastic diagonalization .",
    "but for large interactions it is necessary to perform dramatically more mcs in the pqmc respectively to collect much more states in the sd .",
    "the observation that with an increase of @xmath131 the amount of cpu - time is enhanced dramatically leads to the problem that these calculations can not be performed with state of the art computers for large interaction strengths @xmath131 .",
    "this increase in cpu - time was found both , in the rhm where it was expected due to the occurrence of the well - known minus sign problem and in the ahm that is minus sign free .",
