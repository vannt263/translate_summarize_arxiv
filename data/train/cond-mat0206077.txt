    "the interaction between the _ elements _ of social , technological , biological , chemical and physical systems usually defines complex networks .",
    "the study of topological properties in such networks has recently generated a lot of interest among the scientific community @xcite .",
    "part of this interest comes from the attempt to understand the behavior of technology based communication networks such as the internet @xcite , the world wide web @xcite , e - mail networks @xcite or phone call networks @xcite .",
    "the study of communication processes is also of interest in other fields , notably in the design of organizations @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that more than one - half of the u.s .",
    "work force is dedicated to information processing , rather than to make or sell things in the narrow sense @xcite .",
    "tools taken from statistical mechanics are used to understand not only the topological properties of these communication networks , but also their dynamical properties .",
    "particularly interesting is the phenomenon of congestion . in has been observed , both in real networks @xcite and in model communication networks , @xcite that the system only behaves efficiently when the amount of information handled is small enough .",
    "the network collapses above a certain threshold and some information is accumulated and remains undelivered over large time periods  or it is simply lost .",
    "this transition from a _ free _ to a _ congested _ regime is indeed a phase transition and could be related to the appearance of the @xmath4 noise observed in internet flow data @xcite .",
    "understanding congestion is also important from an engineering point of view .",
    "for instance , in october of 1986 , during the first internet collapse reported in the literature , the speed of the connection between the lawrence berkeley laboratory and the uc at berkeley  separated by 200 meters dropped by a factor of 100 @xcite . although the problem of congestion , and in particular its prevention and control @xcite , has been studied because of its implications in digital communications , a deep understanding of the physics of congestion for general communication processes and beyond particular protocols is still lacking .",
    "a general collection of models that captures the essential features of communication processes has been recently proposed @xcite . in these models ,",
    "agents  nodes  are organized in a hierarchical network  a cayley tree and interchange information _",
    "packets_. each agent has a certain capability that decreases as the number of packets to deliver increases .",
    "when the capability is inversely proportional to the number of accumulated packets , a continuous phase transition was found between the free and the congested phases .",
    "this transition was characterized by means of an order parameter .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the collection of models mentioned above , since only hierarchical lattices and a very particular congestion behavior ",
    "capability inversely proportional to the number of accumulated packets  were considered .",
    "an extension to consider the existence of cost to maintain communication channels has already been done @xcite .",
    "first , the network model is extended beyond purely hierarchical cayley trees .",
    "in particular , 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional lattices are considered .",
    "it should be noted that simple models such as cayley trees and regular lattices can capture the main characteristics of the dynamics of information flow in complex networks .",
    "hierarchical trees have been considered to model the tcp / ip protocol in the internet @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , computer based communication networks have been described by placing routers and servers in square lattices @xcite .",
    "moreover it is shown that , independently of the topology , the collection of models can be split into three groups according to how the network collapses . in the first group , agents deliver more packets as they are more congested  although their capability , as defined in @xcite , decreases , and the network never collapses . in the second group ,",
    "agents deliver always the same number of packets independently of their load  number of packets to deliver ; this behavior leads to a continuous phase transition as reported for hierarchical lattices in @xcite .",
    "finally , when agents deliver fewer packets as their loads increase , the transition to the congested phase is discontinuous and the network collapses in an inhomogeneous way giving rise to congestion nuclei . to characterize these behaviors , the order parameter defined in @xcite",
    "is used , but also the power spectrum of the fluctuations and a susceptibility - like function .",
    "most of the current effort is focused on the quantitative study of the continuous transition and the critical behavior associated to such a transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the collection of models and describes some details concerning the extension beyond hierarchical lattices , including 1d and 2d lattices . in section 3 , these models are studied numerically and analytically .",
    "the scaling of the critical point with the size of the system , the behavior of the order parameter , and the divergence of the characteristic time at the critical point are studied in detail .",
    "finally , section 4 includes the discussion of the results and the conclusions .",
    "the model considers three basic components : ( i ) the physical support for the communication process  agents and communication channels , ( ii ) the discrete information packets that are interchanged , and ( iii ) the limited capability of the agents to handle such packets .",
    "the communication network is mapped onto a graph where nodes mimic the communicating agents ( for instance , employees in a company , routers and servers in a computer network , etc . ) and the links between them represent communication lines . in particular , the three different topologies depicted in fig .  [ nets ] are considered : 1d lattices of length @xmath5 , 2d square lattices of side length @xmath5 and size @xmath6 , and hierarchical cayley trees with branching @xmath7 and a number of generations or levels @xmath8 , hereafter denoted @xmath9 .    ;",
    "( b ) 2d lattice with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; and ( c ) @xmath12 cayley tree with branching @xmath13 and @xmath14 levels or generations . ]",
    "the dynamics of the model is as follows . at each time step @xmath15",
    ", an information packet is created at every node with probability @xmath16 .",
    "therefore @xmath16 is the control parameter : small values of @xmath16 correspond to low density of packets and high values of @xmath16 correspond to high density of packets .",
    "when a new packet is created , a destination node , different from the origin node , is chosen randomly in the network .",
    "thus , during the following time steps @xmath17 , the packet travels toward its destination . once the packet reaches the destination node , it is delivered and disappears from the network .",
    "the time that a packet remains in the network is related not only to the distance between the source and the target nodes , but also to the amount of packets in its path .",
    "in particular , at each time step , all the packets move from their current position , @xmath18 , to the next node in their path , @xmath19 , with a probability @xmath20 .",
    "this probability @xmath20 is called the _ quality of the channel _ between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and was defined in @xcite as @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the _ capability _ of agent @xmath18 at each time step .",
    "the quality of a channel is , thus , the geometric average of the capabilities of the two nodes involved , so that when one of the agents has capability 0 , the channel is disabled .",
    "high qualities ( @xmath23 ) imply that packets move easily while low qualities ( @xmath24 ) imply that it takes a long time for a packet to jump from one node to the next .",
    "the general equation proposed for @xmath22 is : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of packets currently at node @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath27 determines how the capability evolves when the number of packets at a given node changes , @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "equation ( [ f_1 ] ) defines a complete collection of models with agents that behave differently depending on the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the average number of packets delivered during one time step by a node @xmath18 to another node @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath30 . assuming that @xmath31 the former expression reads @xmath32 .",
    "the proportionality is exact both in the hierarchical lattice and in large enough 1d and 2d lattices , where adjacent nodes are statistically equivalent .",
    "therefore , for @xmath2 the number of delivered packets increases with the number of accumulated packets . for @xmath3",
    "the number of delivered packets decreases as the number of accumulated packets increases .",
    "finally , for the particular case @xmath1 , the number of delivered packets is independent of the number of accumulated packets .",
    "note that this particular case is consistent with simple models of queues @xcite .",
    "the last point that needs to be explained to completely define the current model is the routing algorithm or , in other words , the set of rules that the nodes follow to select where to send a certain packet . in all the topologies considered ( 1d , 2d and cayley ) the packets follow paths of minimum length from their origin to their destination  open boundary conditions are set in both 1d and 2d networks . in 1d lattices and cayley trees",
    "it is trivial to follow a minimum path because there is only one minimum path between two arbitrary nodes . in 2d lattices , however , there are many minimum paths .",
    "if a node can choose between two neighbors when sending a given packet , and both neighbors belong to a minimum path between the origin and the destination of the packet , one of them is chosen randomly with equal probability .",
    "this algorithm is indeed the simplest one and the interpretation of the results is clearer than for more complex routing algorithms .",
    "however , congested nodes will still have lower probability of receiving packets because of the definition of the quality of a channel .",
    "therefore packets will avoid those nodes to some extent , as would happen in more sophisticated routing algorithms .",
    "for certain parameters of the model ( in particular @xmath1 @xcite ) and for similar models of traffic @xcite , a transition from a _ free _ regime , where all the packets reach their destination , to a _ congested _ , regime where some packets are accumulated in the network , has been found .",
    "this transition is properly described by means of the following order parameter @xmath33 introduced previously @xcite : @xmath34 in this equation @xmath35 and @xmath36 indicates average over time windows of width @xmath37 .",
    "these averages can be over one or many realizations , yielding the same result .",
    "essentially , the order parameter represents the ratio between undelivered and generated packets calculated at long enough times such that @xmath38 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 is only a function of the probability of packet generation per node and time step , @xmath16 .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath40 of the total number of packets in the network @xmath41 is also used here to further understand the phase transition . by means of the power spectrum the behavior of the time correlations of the system can be studied .",
    "let us study separately the critical case @xmath1 and the non critical cases @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a continuous transition between the free regime and the congested regime occurs in hierarchical networks for @xmath1 , as reported in @xcite . for small values of @xmath16 ,",
    "all the packets reach their destination and the total number of packets @xmath42 fluctuates around a finite value . in this case",
    "the order parameter is @xmath43 .",
    "however , as @xmath16 increases , a critical point @xmath44 is reached , where the fluctuations in @xmath42 become very large and the characteristic time of the system diverges ( critical slowing down ) . beyond this point ,",
    "some packets remain undelivered and @xmath45 grows linearly with @xmath15 .",
    "the same qualitative behavior is observed here for 1d and 2d lattices , although there are quantitative differences .    from an engineering point of view",
    "it is interesting to study first the behavior of @xmath44 as the number of nodes in the network @xmath46 changes , because it will provide valuable information about the scalability of the network .",
    "note that @xmath47 is the maximum number of packets that the network can handle per time step and , thus , it is a measure of the capacity of the network .    for the hierarchical cayley tree , a mean field calculation of @xmath44 was obtained in @xcite : @xmath48 where the approximation holds for @xmath49 .",
    "it is also possible to derive a mean field expression of @xmath44 for the 1d lattice .",
    "since the most congested node is , from symmetry arguments , the central one  the node at @xmath50 , the network will collapse when the amount of packets received by this central node is higher than the maximum number of packets that it is able to deliver .",
    "since in a large enough network it is safe to assume that the central node will be congested similarly to its neighbors , @xmath51 , the maximum number of delivered packets should be 1 .",
    "on the other hand , the number of packets arriving to the central node at each time step is the number of packets that are generated at each time step at the left half of the network and have their destination at the right half and conversely , this is @xmath52 .",
    "then the critical condition is given by @xmath53    these mean field expressions ( [ pcb ] ) and ( [ pc1 ] ) can be compared with simulations .",
    "nevertheless , the fluctuations of @xmath42 become very large near @xmath44 and it is difficult to calculate the value of the order parameter . instead",
    ", a susceptibility - like function @xmath54 can be defined by analogy with equilibrium thermal critical phenomena , and used to estimate more accurately the value of the critical probability of packet generation , @xmath44 .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath55 is related to the fluctuations of the order parameter by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the width of a time window , and @xmath58 is the standard deviation of the order parameter estimated from the analysis of many different time windows of width @xmath57 .",
    "thus a calculation implies a long realization of @xmath42 , its division into windows of width @xmath57 , calculation of the average value of the order parameter in each window and finally the determination of the standard deviation of these values .",
    "the susceptibility shows ( fig .",
    "[ suscep ] ) a singularity at @xmath44 as @xmath57 grows , as expected .     and ( b ) a ( 5,4 ) cayley tree , for different time windows @xmath57 .",
    "the vertical dotted line corresponds to the mean field calculation of the critical point ( equations ( [ pc1 ] ) and ( [ pcb ] ) respectively.),title=\"fig : \" ] +    and ( b ) a ( 5,4 ) cayley tree , for different time windows @xmath57 .",

    "the error bars of the numerical points are smaller than the size of the symbols.,title=\"fig:\",height=182 ] +    for the 2d lattice it is more difficult to obtain even a mean field expression for @xmath44 .",
    "however , since for 1d lattices and cayley trees the scaling relation @xmath59 holds  where @xmath46 is the size of the network , one may expect the same behavior for the 2d lattice . using the susceptibility to numerically determine @xmath44 from simulations ,",
    "one finds that this turns out to be incorrect .",
    "although it is difficult to obtain a precise value of the exponent , fig  [ 2d ] shows that it is close to 0.6 instead of 1.0 : @xmath60     lattice .",

    "( b ) scaling of the critical probability of packet generation as a function of the size of the system for 2d square lattices.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    this result suggests that the existence of multiple paths to get from the origin to the destination has important consequences , not only in shifting the value of @xmath44 , but actually changing its critical scaling behavior .",
    "the behavior of the order parameter is studied next .",
    "it is possible to derive an analytical expression for the simplest 1d case where there are only two nodes that exchange packets . since from symmetry considerations @xmath61 , the average number of packets eliminated in one time step is @xmath62 , while the number of generated packets is @xmath63 .",
    "thus @xmath64 and with the present formulation of the model it is not possible to reach the super - critical congested regime .",
    "however , @xmath16 can be extended to be the average number of generated packets per node at each step ( instead of a probability ) and in this case it can actually be as large as needed . as a result , the order parameter for the super - critical phase is @xmath65 . as observed in fig .",
    "[ par_ordre ] , the general form @xmath66 fits very accurately the behavior of the order parameter not only for this simple 1d lattice with @xmath67 or the cayley tree @xcite , but also for any 1d lattice .",

    "the analysis of the power spectrum shows that in the sub - critical regime , i.e. in the free phase , the spectrum is well fitted by a lorentzian characterized by a frequency , @xmath69 , corresponding to exponentially decaying correlations with a characteristic time @xmath70 , as depicted in fig .",

    "the determination of @xmath81 is interesting not only from an academic point of view , but also from an engineering perspective .",
    "indeed , this exponent is related to divergences of other relevant quantities near the critical point . any characteristic time @xmath70the average time to deliver a packet , for instance",
    " will diverge as @xmath87 and similarly the total number of packets @xmath88 since @xmath89 from little s law @xcite .",
    "this law states that , in steady state , the number of delivered packets and the number of generated packets are equal .",
    "the estimation of @xmath81 is particularly interesting in electronic communication protocols . indeed , eq .",
    "( [ fort ] ) is used to determine the waiting time before a packet is considered lost in the network and therefore sent again @xcite . in practice , the exponent @xmath90 predicted by classical queue theory @xcite is assumed , while our current results suggest that more complex settings can lead to exponents even larger than 2 .",
    "we have shown that the number of packets delivered by node @xmath18 is @xmath32 and thus , when @xmath2 , it increases with the number of packets that this node accumulates .",
    "it is difficult to imagine a real scenario with this characteristic .",
    "however , this case has been included to understand the critical behavior when @xmath91 , i.e. , to show the relationship between criticality and the amount of packets that can be delivered when load increases . as a consequence of the increase of the deliver capability with the load ,",
    "the transition to collapse will never occur because , at some point in time , the number of accumulated packets will be large enough and the number of delivered and created packets will balance each other .",
    "thus , the order parameter will be zero for any value of the control parameter @xmath16 , and the correlations will decay exponentially . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fc_alt1 ] , the characteristic frequency tends asymptotically to @xmath92 as @xmath16 increases .",
    "this asymptotic value depends on the size of the system .    for a 1d lattice with a high density of packets ( @xmath93 ) , the number of packets that are delivered by a node is @xmath32 while the number of packets that are being delivered to this node is proportional to @xmath5 ( for instance , for the central node",
    ", this number is simply @xmath52 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 .",
    "the total number of packets is @xmath95 and according to little s law @xmath96    on the other hand , for @xmath97 the scaling of the characteristic frequency is given by @xmath98 since the packets success to jump from one node to the next at each time step , and therefore the characteristic time is directly the average path length between nodes .",
    "therefore , although there is no phase transition in this case @xmath2 , there is a cross - over from a low density behavior to a high density behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fc_alt1 ] . this crossover",
    "is also observed in 2d lattices and cayley trees .     as a function of the probability of packet generation @xmath16 , for @xmath99 and different sizes of a 1d lattice . as observed , @xmath69 never becomes 0 as happens in the critical @xmath1 case .",

    "the lines represent the fittings provided by equation ( [ fc01d ] ) @xmath102 , and equation ( [ fc*1d ] ) @xmath103 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the phase transition observed for @xmath1 is recovered when @xmath3 . above a certain threshold ,",
    "some packets are accumulated in the network and the order parameter differs from 0 .",
    "however , the number of packets delivered by a node @xmath18 in this case @xmath3 decreases with the number of packets accumulated at that node .",
    "therefore , when some packets are accumulated , @xmath26 grows and finally no packets are delivered at all .",
    "thus suddenly above the transition , which is discontinuous , the order parameter becomes 1 .",
    "the change in the order of the phase transition affects the spreading of the collapse over the network . in the critical case @xmath1",

    "a collection of models recently proposed for hierarchical networks @xcite has been examined in detail for several network topologies including 1d and 2d lattices , to characterize the phase transition to collapse .",
    "new congestion scenarios have been analyzed .",
    "first , it has been shown that the congestion behavior is governed by the ability of agents to deliver information packets when their load increases .",
    "when agents deliver packets at a constant ratio independently of their load  number of packets to deliver , a continuous transition as the one reported in @xcite for cayley trees is also observed for 1d and 2d lattices , the order parameter being the fraction of accumulated packets .",
    "when the number of delivered packets increases with the load , no phase transition is observed .",
    "conversely , when the number of delivered packets decreases with the load , the order parameter jumps from zero to one and the transition becomes discontinuous .",
    "these different behaviors are tuned by a single parameter @xmath0 , which is the exponent that determines how the capability of nodes evolves with the number of accumulated packets .",
    "when @xmath2 there is no transition to the congested regime , for @xmath1 the transition is continuous and for @xmath3 the transition is discontinuous .",
    "note that the continuous transition ( reported in @xcite and in some models of queues @xcite ) is only a particular case between a no - congestion behavior and a discontinuous transition behavior .",
    "thus , the critical behavior is intimately related to the independence between load and deliver capability of nodes .",
    "these different behaviors have been analyzed separately .",
    "the critical case @xmath1 presents the most interesting behavior . to properly understand the physics of the collapse process",
    "it is necessary to know how the system approaches the critical point .",
    "the order parameter becomes useless in this region due to the emergence of large fluctuations , and then we have defined a susceptibility - like function that is related , by analogy to equilibrium critical phenomena , to fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "this quantity shows a peak at the critical point and allows to study the dependence on the size and topology of the system . for 1d lattices and cayley trees ,",
    "it has been shown ( by means of simulation and also with mean field calculations ) that @xmath44 scales as the inverse of the size of the system , @xmath59 . however , for 2d lattices a different scaling @xmath108 is obtained .",
    "it is suggested that the existence of multiple paths from the origin to the destination of the packets is the responsible for this change in the scaling behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of the power spectrum of the number of the packets in the network as a function of time has provided valuable information about the variation of temporal correlations in the system . in particular , below @xmath44 correlations decay exponentially , with a characteristic time @xmath70 that diverges at @xmath44 .",
    "the exponent of this divergence is significantly larger than what is expected from queue theory .",
    "this can be relevant to accurately forecast the temporal behavior in complex communication settings .    for @xmath2 , no phase transition is observed .",
    "instead , a cross - over from a low - density to a high - density regime occurs . in the low density regime , the characteristic frequency",
    "is determined by the average distance between nodes , while in the high density regime the characteristic frequency is determined by the capability of agents to deliver information packets . in 1d lattices ,",
    "the cross - over changes the scaling from @xmath109 at low densities to @xmath110 at high densities .    finally ,",
    "when @xmath3 the transition to the congested regime is discontinuous , since the number of delivered packets decreases with the load and for long times no packets are delivered at all .",
    "thus the order parameter jumps from 0 to 1 .",
