    "quantum random walks as introduced by aharonov , davidovich and zagury @xcite in 1993 have gained considerable attention over the last decade or so . it could be demonstrated that a quantum version of a classical random walk has transport properties which exhibit polynomial or even exponential speed - up compared to a classical random walk , see @xcite for overviews .",
    "this has recently lead to increased efforts for implementing quantum random walks experimentally .",
    "in particular , one dimensional quantum walks have been realised using neutral atoms in optical lattices @xcite , with trapped ions @xcite , using coupled optical wave guides @xcite and single photons @xcite .",
    "one of the most fascinating applications based on quantum random walk concepts are spatial quantum search algorithms . like grover s search algorithm @xcite for searching an unstructured data base ,",
    "quantum walk search algorithms can ( usually ) achieve a quadratic speed up compared to the corresponding classical search .",
    "the most prominent algorithms are the search on a hypercube introduced by shenvi , kempe and whaley @xcite and the search on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice presented by childs and goldstone @xcite in a continuous time version and by ambainis , kempe and rivosh ( akr ) @xcite as a discrete time algorithm .",
    "in particular , it has been pointed out that the search in a two - dimensional lattice is critical with the number of search steps scaling like @xmath3 whereas quantum search algorithms on the hypercube as well as for lattices of dimension @xmath4 scale like @xmath5 ; here , @xmath6 is the number of vertices .",
    "expressions for the leading order coefficients for the search time in the hypercube have been given in @xcite , proposals for improving the efficiency of the hypercube search can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the number of steps for solving the search problem on a two - dimensional lattice can be decreased to @xmath7 by modifying the quantum walk search algorithm , thus coming closer to the theoretical lower bound @xmath8 indicates that there exist two positive constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 , such that for all @xmath11 the inequality @xmath12 is true .",
    "similarly @xmath13 will be written if @xmath14 for all @xmath11 for some constants @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 denotes that @xmath17 as well as @xmath18 . ] @xcite . by changing the starting state ,",
    "it has been demonstrated in @xcite that quantum search algorithms on lattices can also be used in a sender - receiver configuration .",
    "remarkably , this makes it possible to communicate across the lattice by sending information exclusively between two ( or more ) marked vertices where neither the sender nor the receivers need to know each others position .",
    "we will in the following focus on the akr search algorithm on @xmath0-dimensional lattices . extending the ideas and techniques from @xcite",
    ", we will give improved estimates for the approximate eigenstate of the walk localised on the target vertex .",
    "this makes it possible to give closed form expressions for the leading order coefficients both for the search time and the search efficiency , that is , the overlap of the localised state with the target vertex .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the search algorithm on the lattice and the basic vectors spanning the search space in the full hilbert space are introduced in section [ chap : grid ] ; this is followed by a detailed calculation of the normalisation constant for the approximate eigenvector localised on the target vertex in section [ grid : calculation b ] . in section [ sec : avoidedcrossings ] , we analyse the spectral gap at the avoided crossing in an ( approximately ) invariant two - dimensional subspace . the results for leading order contributions to the localisation time and the amplitude at the target vertex are given in section [ grid : results ] .",
    "quantum search algorithms - like grover s search - are usually described in terms of a two unitary matrices : a quantum or wave propagator acting uniformly on the search space and a `` marker '' ( or oracle ) matrix which deviates from the identity only locally near the marked item .",
    "we will discuss here a lattice search algorithm of this type which was first introduce in @xcite .",
    "we will limit the discussion to the search of one target vertex only .",
    "a generalisation to more than one marked item is straightforward and is discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will first introduce the propagator without a marked vertex leading to a quantum random walk on the lattice . the full quantum search algorithm and an analysis of the search mechanism",

    "+      we consider a @xmath0-dimensional regular lattice with @xmath19 vertices along each dimension , that is , @xmath20 vertices overall .",
    "the positions of the vertices in the lattice are defined by the set of vectors @xmath21 with integer coordinates @xmath22 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions will be assumed throughout .    following the spirit of quantum graph theory",
    ", we consider quantum waves propagating freely along 1-dimensional bonds connecting adjacent vertices @xcite .",
    "waves undergo scattering at the vertices described by a @xmath23 scattering matrix @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number of bonds connected at each vertex .",
    "the scattering mechanism is the same at all vertices and the quantum dynamics on the lattice is in fact equivalent to a quantum random walk , see @xcite .",
    "( the unitary scattering matrix @xmath24 can then also be interpreted as a coin flip matrix acting on an internal ( spin- ) degree of freedom of a quantum walker ) .",
    "the total hilbert space @xmath26 of the problem is described as the tensor product of a vertex or position space @xmath27 and a direction or coin space @xmath28 representing waves travelling in the negative / positive direction along the @xmath29th axis , @xmath30 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath26 is thus @xmath31 .",
    "we chose a scattering matrix @xmath24 which is unbiased with respect to the outgoing directions ( except possibly for back - scattering ) .",
    "a natural choice is grover s matrix @xcite ( which incidentally also features prominently in a quantum graph approach using kirchhoff boundary conditions on the vertices , see @xcite ) .",
    "that is , we define @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the uniform distribution in coin space , that is , @xmath34 we have identical scattering processes at all vertices and we thus define a global coin flip matrix    @xmath35    the wave propagation on the lattice is now given by a `` shift '' matrix @xmath36 .",
    "waves emanating from vertex @xmath27 in the @xmath37th direction will reach vertex @xmath38 with @xmath39 , the unit vector in the @xmath40th direction .",

    "the vector in position space can be factorised in the form @xmath56 , where the @xmath57 are obtained from the canonical basis vectors of position space using a fourier transformation , that is , @xmath58 the thus obtained basis provides a convenient way to denote the eigenvectors in position space .    for the quantum search ,",
    "only @xmath59 of the @xmath60 eigenvectors of @xmath49 are important , namely those having a coin space component not orthogonal to @xmath61 .",
    "these vectors are the @xmath62-eigenvector @xmath63 , which is the uniform distribution , and two eigenvectors @xcite @xmath64 for each @xmath65 with complex conjugated eigenvalues @xmath66 and @xmath67    the expressions for the vector @xmath68 in coin space become more and more cumbersome with increasing @xmath0 and we will not attempt to give closed form expressions here .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath69 which is all we need in what follows .",
    "in addition , one has @xmath70 eigenvectors with eigenvalue @xmath62 and @xmath71 eigenvectors with eigenvalue @xmath72 all with coin components perpendicular to @xmath33 .",
    "note that the high degeneracies in the @xmath73 eigenspaces are due to the special choice of the coin flip matrices @xmath24 and thus @xmath74 .",
    "we now assume that the lattice contains one marked vertex at ( a yet unknown ) position @xmath75 ; here , the marking is done by applying a different coin flip or scattering matrix @xmath76 at this target vertex @xmath77 .",
    "the search algorithm is then defined as @xmath78 @xmath79 note that , since @xmath80 is a projection on the target vertex , the additional term changes at most @xmath81 matrix elements in @xmath49 .",
    "as @xmath49 is a @xmath82-matrix , @xmath83 is identical to @xmath49 up to a local perturbation and the quantum search algorithm can be regarded as a locally perturbed quantum random walk .",

    "we note that eigenvectors of @xmath49 with eigenvalues @xmath73 ( except the important vector @xmath86 ) are orthogonal to @xmath96 and thus remain eigenvectors of @xmath95 independent of the value of @xmath97 ; this part of @xmath26 is thus irrelevant for the localisation effect .",

    "our approach is based on the work in @xcite and makes it possible to go beyond the results found in @xcite by giving explicit leading order coefficients for the search time .",
    "the overall strategy is best explained by considering briefly the spectrum of eigenphases @xmath106 of @xmath91 ; in fig .",
    "[ figgrid : eigenphases ] , the eigenphases are shown for an @xmath107 lattice in the reduced space @xmath98 .",

    "it will be argued that @xmath109 is localised in the vicinity of the target vertex and that the subspace @xmath110 is an approximate basis for the two - dimensional eigenspace spanned by the exact eigenstates at the crossing .",
    "the quantum search amounts then to a rotation in this two - dimensional subspace of @xmath111 similar to the mechanism found in grover s original search .",
    "it is important to note that unlike for grover s algorithm , for the lattice search only approximate expressions for the state @xmath112 are known which will be given below ; furthermore , the starting state @xmath86 has a small overlap with the rest of the spectrum at @xmath94 leading to losses .",

    "note , however , that the state @xmath268 is still localised on the marked vertex for @xmath1 since the average amplitude of an eigenstate of the random walk @xmath47 on an arbitrary vertex decreases like @xmath269 .",

    "we presented a detailed analysis of the lattice search and show in particular that the search mechanism is based on a rotation from a uniformly extended state to a localised state coupled at an avoided crossing point in the spectrum of the operator @xmath91 .",
    "the search time and localisation strength can be obtained from an effectively two - dimensional model similar to the analysis in @xcite .",
    "we have thus independently verified the scaling behaviour of the search time and localisation probability as stated in @xcite and can now also give explicit expressions for the leading order coefficients ; the results have been verified by numerical simulations .    a generalisation to a search with more than one marked item is straightforward and leads to reduced models as presented in @xcite .",
    "we also give a detailed derivation of how to obtain the localised state @xmath273 asymptotically .",
    "this is important for the wave communication protocols proposed in @xcite ; here , the search algorithm is used to search for more than one marked vertex , to send signals through the lattice from a sender to one or more receiver points and to construct new search algorithms that do not rely on knowing the number of target vertices .",
