    "the problem of determining a realistic interaction among hyperons and nucleons capable of reconciling the terrestrial measurements on hypernuclei and the recent observations of very massive neutron stars is still by and large unsolved .",
    "the amount of data available for nucleon - nucleon scattering  @xcite is enough to build satisfactory models of nuclear forces , either purely phenomenological or built on the basis of an effective field theory @xcite . in the hyperon - nucleon sector , much less data are available  @xcite , and almost nothing is known about the hyperon - hyperon interaction .",
    "the main reasons of this lack of information are the instability of hyperons in the vacuum and the impossibility of collecting hyperon - neutron and hyperon - hyperon scattering data .",
    "this implies that interaction models must be fitted mostly to binding energies ( and possibly excitations ) of hypernuclei .    besides the very old emulsion data  @xcite ,",
    "several measurements of hypernuclear energies have become available in the last few years  @xcite , both for single and double @xmath0  hypernuclei .",
    "these can be used to validate or to constrain the hyperon - nucleon interactions within the framework of many - body systems .",
    "the ultimate goal is then to constrain these forces by reproducing the experimental energies of hypernuclei from light systems made of few particles up to heavier systems .    in previous work",
    "it was shown that the inclusion of a @xmath3 interaction gives a very important repulsive contribution towards a realistic description of the saturation property of the @xmath0  separation energy in medium - heavy hypernuclei  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on single and double @xmath0  hypernuclei to study more in detail the role of @xmath4 and @xmath3 interactions .",
    "ground state properties of hypernuclei are here computed by means of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods , and in particular by the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) algorithm .",
    "these methods have been shown to be very accurate in solving the many - body problem fully non - perturbatively even when the system is dominated by very strong correlations that can not be neglected  @xcite .",
    "this is the case for nuclear systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamiltonians ] , we introduce the hamiltonians involved in the description of single and double @xmath0  hypernuclei .",

    "the interaction between nucleons is described via the argonne v4 and v6 two body - potentials  @xcite , that are simplified versions of the more sophisticated argonne v18 potential  @xcite obtained with a re - projection of the interaction to preserve the phase shifts of lower partial waves .",
    "the argonne potential between two nucleons @xmath10 and @xmath11 is written in coordinate space as a sum of operators @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of operators , which depends on the potential , @xmath14 are radial functions , and @xmath15 is the interparticle distance .",
    "the six operators included in the argonne v6 potential mainly come from the one - pion exchange ( ope ) between nucleons and they read @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the usual tensor operator @xmath18 the av4 force does not include the tensor terms @xmath19 .",
    "it is important to note that the above nuclear potentials do not provide the same accuracy as av18 in fitting @xmath20 scattering data in all partial waves . in addition , three - body @xmath21 forces are purposely disregarded for technical reasons related to the afdmc algorithm used . as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , these restrictions on the nuclear potentials do not affect the main result of this work , namely the calculation of the @xmath0  separation energy ( the difference between the binding energy of a nucleus and the corresponding @xmath0  hypernucleus ) , which is not significantly dependent on the specific choice of the nucleon hamiltonian .      to describe the interaction between the @xmath0  particle and the nucleons",
    ", we adopt a class of argonne - like interactions that have been developed starting from the 1980 s by bodmer , usmani , and carlson on the grounds of quantum monte carlo methods and have been mostly used in variational monte carlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the interaction is written in coordinate space and it includes two- and three - body hyperon - nucleon components with a hard - core repulsion between baryons and a charge symmetry breaking term .    _",
    "@xmath4 charge symmetric potential._[subsubsec : ln ] since the @xmath0  particle has isospin @xmath22 , there is no ope term , the strong @xmath23 vertex being forbidden due to isospin conservation .",
    "the @xmath0 hyperon can exchange a pion only via a @xmath24 vertex .",
    "the lowest - order @xmath4 coupling must therefore involve the exchange of two pions , with the formation of a virtual @xmath25 hyperon , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the spin - average and spin - dependent strengths , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote singlet- and triplet - state strengths , respectively .",

    "@xmath46 being negative , the @xmath31 channel becomes attractive while the @xmath43 channel is repulsive .",

    "@xmath3 potential._[subsubsec : lnn ] in contrast to the nucleon - nucleon force , the lowest order @xmath0-nucleon interaction involves the exchange of two pions . at the same 2@xmath26-exchange order , there are diagrams involving two nucleons and one hyperon , as shown in figs .",
