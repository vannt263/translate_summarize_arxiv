    "the duluth systems in senseval-2 take a supervised learning approach to the spanish and english lexical sample tasks .",
    "they learn decision trees and naive bayesian classifiers from sense - tagged training examples where the context in which an ambiguous word occurs is represented by lexical features . these include unigrams and bigrams that occur anywhere in the context , and co - occurrences within just a few words of the target word .",
    "these are the only types of features used .",
    "there are no syntactic features , nor is the structure or content of wordnet employed . as a result",
    "these systems are highly portable , and can serve as a foundation for systems that are tailored to particular languages and sense inventories .",
    "the word sense disambiguation literature provides ample evidence that many different kinds of features contribute to the resolution of word meaning .",
    "these include part  of  speech , morphology , verb  object relationships , selectional restrictions , lexical features , etc .",
    "when used in combination it is often unclear to what degree each type of feature contributes to overall performance .",
    "it is also unclear to what extent adding new features allows for the disambiguation of previously unresolvable test instances .",
    "one of the long term objectives of our research is to determine which types of features are complementary and cover increasing numbers of test instances as they are added to a representation of context .",
    "the training and test data for the english and spanish lexical sample tasks is split into separate training and test files per word .",
    "a supervised learning algorithm induces a classifier from the training examples for a word , which is then used to assign sense tags to the test instances for that word .",
    "the context in which an ambiguous word occurs is represented by lexical features that are identified using the bigram statistics package ( bsp ) version 0.4 . this is free software that extracts unigrams and bigrams from text using a variety of statistical methods .",
    "each unigram or bigram that is identified in the training data is treated as a binary feature that indicates whether or not it occurs in the context of the word being disambiguated .",
    "the free software package sensetools ( version 0.1 ) converts training and test data into a feature vector representation , based on the output from bsp .",
    "this becomes the input to the weka suite of supervised learning algorithms .",
    "weka induces classifiers from the training examples and applies the sense tags to the test instances .",
    "the same software is used for the english and spanish text .",
    "bsp and sensetools are written in perl and are freely available from www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/code.html .",
    "weka is written in java and is freely available from www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml .",
    "there were eight pairs of duluth systems in the english and spanish lexical sample tasks .",
    "the only language dependent components are the tokenizers and stop  lists . for both english and spanish a stop  list",
    "is made up of all words that occur ten or more times in five randomly selected word training files of comparable size .",
    "all duluth systems exclude the words in the stop ",
    "list from being features .",
    "each pair of systems is summarized below .",
    "all performance results are based on accuracy ( correct / total ) using fine - grained scoring .",
    "the name of the english system appears first , followed by the spanish system .",
    "* duluth1/duluth6 * create an ensemble of three naive bayesian classifiers , where each is based on a different set of features .",
    "the hope is that these different views of the training examples will result in classifiers that make complementary errors , and that their combined performance will be better than any of the individual classifiers .",
    "separate naive bayesian classifiers are learned from each representation of the training examples .",
    "each classifier assigns probabilities to each of the possible senses of a test instance .",
    "these are summed and the sense with the largest value is used .",
    "this technique is used in many of our ensembles and will be referred to as a weighted vote .",
    "the first feature set is made up of bigrams , i.e. , consecutive two word sequences , that can occur anywhere in the context with the ambiguous word . to be selected as a feature ,",
    "a bigram must occur two or more times in the training examples and have a log - likelihood ratio ( @xmath0 ) value @xmath1 6.635 , which is associated with a p - value of .01 .",
    "the second feature set is based on unigrams , i.e. , one word sequences , that occur five or more times in the training data .",
    "the third feature set is made up of co - occurrence features that represent words that occur on the immediate left or right of the target word . in effect , these are bigrams that include the target word .",
    "they must also occur two or more times and have a log - likelihood ratio @xmath1 2.706 , which is associated with a p - value of .10 .",
    "these systems are inspired by @xcite , which presents an ensemble of eighty - one naive bayesian classifiers based on varying sized windows of context to the left and right of the target word that define co - occurrence features .",
    "however , the current systems only use a three member ensemble to capture the spirit of simplicity and portability that underlies the duluth approach to senseval-2 .",
    "english accuracy was 53% , spanish was 58% .",
    "* learn an ensemble of decision trees via bagging .",
    "ten samples are drawn , with replacement , from the training examples for a word .",
    "a decision tree is learned from each of these permutations of the training examples , and each of these trees becomes a member of the ensemble . a test instance is assigned a sense based on a weighted vote among the members of the ensemble . in general decision tree learning",
    "can be overly influenced by a small percentage of the training examples , so the goal of bagging is to smooth out this instability .",
    "there is only one kind of feature used in these systems , bigrams that occur two or more times and have a log - likelihood ratio @xmath1 6.635 .",
    "this is one of the three feature sets used in the duluth1/duluth6 systems .",
    "the set of bigrams that meet these criteria become candidate features for the j48 decision tree learning algorithm , which is the weka implementation of the c4.5 algorithm .",
    "the decision tree learner first constructs a tree of features that characterizes the training data exactly , and then prunes features away to avoid over  fitting and allow it to generalize to the previously unseen test instances .",
    "thus , a decision tree learner performs a second cycle of feature selection and is not likely to use all of the features that we identify prior to learning with bsp .",
    "the default c4.5 parameter settings are used for pruning .",
    "these systems are an extension of @xcite , which learns a single decision tree where the representation of context is based on bigrams .",
    "this earlier work does not use bagging , and the top 100 bigrams according to the log - likelihood ratio are the candidate features .",
    "english accuracy was 54% , spanish was 60% .",
    "* duluth3/duluth8 * rely on the same features as duluth1/duluth6 , but learn an ensemble of three bagged decision trees instead of an ensemble of naive bayesian classifiers .",
    "there is a strong contrast between these techniques , since decision tree learners attempt to characterize the training examples and find relationships among the features , while a naive bayesian classifier is based on an assumption of conditional independence among the features .",
    "the feature set used in these systems is from duluth1/duluth6 and consists of bigrams , unigrams and co - occurrences .",
    "a bagged decision tree is learned for each of the three kinds of features .",
    "the test instances are classified by each of the bagged decision trees , and a majority vote is taken among the members to assign senses to the test instances .",
    "these are the most accurate of the duluth systems for both english ( 57% ) and spanish ( 61% ) .",
    "these are within 7% of the most accurate overall approaches for english ( 64% ) and spanish ( 68% ) .",
    "* duluth4/duluth9 * uses a naive bayesian classifier based on a bag of words representation of context , where each unigram that occurs in the training data is taken as a feature .",
    "this is a common benchmark in word sense disambiguation studies and text classification problems .    in the english training examples",
    "any word that occurs five or more times is used as a feature , and in the spanish data any word that occurs two or more times is used .",
    "these features are used to estimate the parameters of a naive bayesian classifier .",
    "this will assign the most probable sense to a test instance , given the surrounding context .",
    "accuracy for english was 54% , and for spanish 56% .",
    "this naive bayesian classifier was one of the three member classifiers in the ensemble approach of duluth1/duluth7 , which was 1% less accurate for english and and 2% more accurate for spanish .",
    "* duluth5/duluth10 * add a co  occurrence feature to the duluth2/duluth7 systems . in every other respect",
    "they are identical .",
    "the co - occurrence feature was also used in duluth1/duluth6 , and is essentially a bigram where one of the words is the ambiguous word .",
    "these must occur two or more times in the training examples and have a log - likelihood ratio @xmath1 2.706 to be included as a feature .",
    "in addition to the co - occurrence feature the bigram feature from duluth2/duluth7 is used , where a bigram must occur two or more times and have a log - likelihood ratio @xmath1 6.635 .",
    "accuracy for english was 55% , and for spanish 61% .",
    "this was a slight improvement over duluth2 ( 54% ) and duluth7 ( 60% ) .    * dulutha / duluthx * build an ensemble of three different classifiers that are induced from the same representation of the training examples . a weighted vote is taken to assign senses to test instances .",
    "the three classifiers are a bagged j48 decision tree , a naive bayesian classifier , and the nearest neighbor classifier ib@xmath2 , where the number of neighbors parameter @xmath2 is set to 1 .",
    "the context in which the ambiguous word occurs is represented by bigrams that may include zero , one , or two intervening words that are ignored . to be considered as features these bigrams must occur two or more times and have a log - likelihood ratio @xmath1 10.827 , i.e. , a p - value of .001 .",
    "the log - likelihood ratio threshold is set to 0 for the spanish data due to the smaller volume of data .",
    "english accuracy was 52% , spanish was 58% .    * duluthb / duluthy * are identical to duluth5/duluth10 , except that rather than learning an entire decision tree they stop the learning process once the root of the decision tree is selected .",
    "the resulting one node decision tree is called a decision stump . at worst",
    "a decision stump will reproduce the most common sense baseline , and may do better if the selected feature is particularly informative . in previous work we have observed that decision stumps can serve as a very aggressive lower bound on performance @xcite .",
    "decision stumps are the least accurate method for both english ( duluthb , 51% ) and spanish ( duluthy , 52% ) , but are more accurate than the most common sense baseline for english ( 48% ) and spanish ( 47% ) .    * duluthc / duluthz * take a kitchen sink approach to ensemble creation , and combine the seven systems for english and spanish into ensembles that assign senses to test instances by taking a weighted vote among the members .",
    "accuracy for english was 55% , and for spanish 59% .",
    "this is less than the accuracy of some of the members systems , suggesting that the members of the ensemble are making redundant errors .",
    "there are several hypotheses that underly and motivate these systems .",
    "this hypothesis is at the core of much of our recent work .",
    "it holds that variations in learning algorithms matter far less to disambiguation performance than do variations in the features used to represent the context in which an ambiguous word occurs . in other words",
    ", an informative feature set will result in accurate disambiguation when used with a wide range of learning algorithms , but there is no learning algorithm that can overcome the limitations of an uninformative or misleading set of features .",
    "there are a number of demonstrations that can be made from the duluth systems in support of this hypothesis , but perhaps the clearest is found in comparing the systems duluth1/duluth6 and duluth3/duluth8 .",
    "the first pair learns three naive bayesian classifiers and the second learns three bagged decision trees .",
    "both use the same feature set to represent the context in which ambiguous words occur .",
    "there is a 3% improvement in accuracy when using the decision trees .",
    "we believe this modest improvement when moving from a simple learning algorithm to a more complex one supports the hypothesis that the true dividends are to be found in improving the feature set .",
    "we hypothesize a 50/25/25 rule for supervised approaches to word sense disambiguation .",
    "this loosely holds that given a classifier learned from a sample of sense  tagged training examples , about half of the test instances are easily disambiguated , a quarter are harder but still possible , and the remaining quarter are extremely difficult .",
    "this is a minor variant of the 80/20 rule of time management , which holds that 20% of effort accounts for 80% of results .    when the two highest ranking systems in the official english lexical sample results are compared there are 2180 test instances ( 50% ) that both disambiguate correctly using fine - grained scoring",
    "there are an additional 1183 instances ( 28% ) where one of the two systems are correct , and 965 instances ( 22% ) that neither system can resolve .",
    "if these two systems were optimally combined , their accuracy would be 78% .",
    "if the third - place system is also considered , there are 1939 instances ( 44.8% ) that all three systems can disambiguate , and 816 ( 19% ) that none could resolve .    for all the duluth systems for english , there are 1705 instances ( 39% ) that all eight systems got correct .",
    "there are 1299 instances ( 30% ) that none can resolve",
    ". the accuracy of an optimally combined system would be 70% .",
    "the most accurate individual system is duluth3 with 57% accuracy .    for the spanish duluth systems",
    ", there are 856 instances ( 38% ) that all eight systems got correct",
    ". there are 478 instances ( 21% ) that none of the systems got correct .",
    "this results in an optimally combined result of 79% .",
    "the most accurate duluth system was duluth8 , with 1369 correct instances ( 62% ) .",
    "if the top ranked spanish system ( 68% ) and duluth8 are compared , there are 1086 instances ( 49% ) where both are correct , 737 instances ( 33% ) where one or the other is correct , and 402 instances ( 18% ) where neither system is correct .",
    "this is intended as a rule of thumb , and suggests that a fairly substantial percentage of test instances can be resolved by almost any means , and that a hard core of test instances will be very difficult for any method to resolve .",
