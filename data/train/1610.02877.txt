    "we consider an investment model in continuous time where the decision maker has the option to invest in a given project yielding uncertain returns @xmath0 .",
    "the investors objective is to choose the entry time such that a particular objective functional ( often of either discounted or ergodic type ) is maximised . at the time of the entry , a known fixed lump sum @xmath1 of entry costs must be paid .",
    "once the entry is made , the investment incurs a known constant instantaneous running cost @xmath2 . in the classical perpetual version of this problem , see , e.g. , @xcite , it is assumed that once the entry is made , the return from the investment will accrue from the investment date to infinity .",
    "a variant of this problem includes the possibility of voluntary exits , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes then of sequential nature , where a sequence of entry and exit times is determined such that the objective functional is maximised .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study a class of multiple entry problems where the exits are not voluntary but forced .",
    "this type of problem was first studied in @xcite and can be informally described as follows .",
    "subject to return uncertainty modelled by a time homogeneous diffusion process @xmath0 , and known entry and running costs @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the investor chooses the time of entry . however , the investment is subject to exogenous interventions , which will terminate the flow of returns .",
    "these interventions occur uniformly over time and are modelled by the jumps of a poisson process @xmath3 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "once the investment is terminated , the decision maker can make a new entry .",
    "the objective is then to maximise the expected present value of the total revenue from the investment .",
    "as was discussed already in @xcite , this setting lends itself to a possible application to a so - called liquidation risk @xcite . consider the case where the investor is funding the investment with borrowed money . to increase liquidity on the lenders side , it is possible that the lender is given ( or requires ) the right to seize the asset and put it to alternative use , that is , liquidate .",
    "thus the intervention would be forced liquidation from the lenders side .",
    "after a forced liquidation , the investor can find a new lender to make a new entry .",
    "this paper makes two contributions .",
    "first , we allow the underlying stochastic process @xmath0 to follow a general one - dimensional diffusion process with natural boundaries . in comparison to @xcite , where the case of geometric brownian motion is considered ,",
    "this is a substantial generalisation which has not , to our best knowledge , been studied earlier in the literature .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a so - called catastrophe risk in the model as follows : we attach iid bernoulli trials to the jump times of @xmath3 and if the trial fails , no further re - entries are allowed . in the liquidation risk application described above , the catastrophe event describes a fundamental change in the economical environment of the investment opportunity such that all lenders lose interest in financing a new entry .",
    "such a change could be , for instance , due to the emergence of a new technology .",
    "this is again a substantial generalisation and it effectively means that the number of forced exits up to the catastrophe is geometrically distributed . somewhat remarkably we find that the optimal investment threshold is independent of the success probability of the bernoulli trials .    the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in section 2 we set up the probabilistic framework . in section 3",
    "the entry problem is introduced .",
    "the solution is derived in section 4 .",
    "the paper is concluded in section 5 with illustrative examples .",
    "we set up the probabilistic framework for the entry problem , for details , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , be a complete filtered probability space satisfying the usual conditions .",
    "assume that the filtration is rich enough to carry the underlying state process @xmath6 and a poisson process @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the process @xmath3 has jump intensity @xmath8 and that it is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the process @xmath0 is a linear diffusion evolving on @xmath9 with the infinitesimal generator @xmath10 and initial state @xmath11 . in what follows , we assume that the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are continuous and that the process does not die inside the state space .",

    "we denote as , respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the increasing and decreasing solution of the ode @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , defined on the domain of the characteristic operator of @xmath0 . by posing appropriate boundary conditions depending on the boundary classification of @xmath0 , the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined uniquely up to a multiplicative constant and can be identified as the minimal @xmath26-excessive functions . to impose the boundary conditions , we assume , using the terminology of @xcite , that the boundaries @xmath27 and @xmath28 are natural .",
