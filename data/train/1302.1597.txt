    "<S> a more detailed inspection of the precipitate structure at 200k ( see movies and snapshots in supplementary material ) shows that precipitates below the transition point ( 2,700 atoms ) have completely adopted a bcc lattice structure while precipitates containing more than 3,000 atoms exhibit multiply - twinned 9r structures as described above . in the intermediate size range [ region a in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    an important signature of first - order transitions is the release of latent heat , which is absent in continuous transitions . to conclusively resolve the character of the observed transitions we have extracted the internal energy density of the cu atoms in the precipitates as a function of precipitate size at various temperatures as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : epot_trans](a ) . at high temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the data exhibit pronounced discontinuities when the higher - energy bcc phase transforms to the more stable 9r phase . as the temperature is lowered the discontinuity in the potential energy </S>",
    "<S> is reduced until it apparently vanishes between 200 and 300k , see fig .  [ fig : epot_trans](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> if true , this implies that a critical point exists in this temperature range , below which the bcc9r transition occurs continuously . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observation of a continuous transition contradicts bulk thermodynamics , according to which the distinct lattice symmetries require the bcc9r transformation to be first order . </S>",
    "<S> can this rule be violated for precipitate sizes as astoundingly large as 2,500 to 3,000 atoms ?         </S>",
    "<S> the key to answering this question lies in the heterogeneous distribution of energy and entropy inside cu precipitates . </S>",
    "<S> for the purpose of this discussion we estimate entropy by employing the debye model for the vibrational spectrum , which provides a simple relation between entropy and mean square displacement ( msd ) . , where @xmath10 is the msd of phase @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> ] figure  [ fig : profiles](a , b ) shows the average atomic potential energies ( pe ) , and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profiles](c , d ) depicts the msd as a function of distance to the centers of precipitates at 700k for several bcc and 9r precipitates . </S>",
    "<S> the pe and msd profiles of the bcc precipitates have similar shapes with a constant region in the core that remains unchanged as the precipitates grow . </S>",
    "<S> the wetting layer is identified as the region outside the core where both the pe and the msd of the cu atoms drop steeply . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the vibrational entropy of the core region of bcc precipitates is much larger than the wetting layer entropy . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to the stabilization of bcc precipitates at elevated temperatures and derives from the vibrational modes of bulk bcc - cu with imaginary frequencies that are stabilized through confinement by the fe matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the pe and msd profiles of the 9r precipitates in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profiles](b , d ) reveals a more complex behavior than in the case of the bcc precipitates . </S>",
    "<S> while the wetting layer seems to be quite similar in size , energy and entropy to the bcc precipitates , the core now consists of two regions : ( _ i _ ) the inner core with uniform energy and entropy , and ( _ ii _ ) the outer core , which constitutes the interface region between the twinned 9r inner core and the wetting layer . </S>",
    "<S> it is strained to accommodate the misorientation between the inner - core 9r lattice and the bcc - fe matrix . in this region , </S>",
    "<S> both energy and msd increase but never exceed the values of the core of the bcc precipitates . </S>",
    "<S> hence the 9r core always contributes positively to the latent heat . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total latent heat @xmath12 generated by the structural transformation is always smaller than the core contribution since the wetting layer energy is always slightly lower in bcc than in 9r precipitates . the total latent heat and its associated entropy @xmath13 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : epot_trans](b ) . both decrease dramatically upon cooling mainly because at lower temperatures transitions involve much fewer atoms as they occur at much smaller cluster sizes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore at lower temperatures the latent heat per atom drops significantly [ see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : profiles](e ) ] due to the fact that in smaller precipitates the core region , which provides the positive contribution to the latent heat , shrinks while the compensating wetting layer thickens . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the number of atoms in the core and the wetting layer regions at the transition as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : epot_trans](b ) .    nevertheless based on the reported temperature dependence of the entropy of transformation in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : epot_trans](b ) , one expects the bcc9r transformation to involve a diminishing but finite latent heat at temperatures clearly below the critical temperature ( @xmath14 ) at which the hysteresis vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> note that at this temperature , as many as 500 cu atoms form the core of the 9r precipitate and thus directly participate in the transformation , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : epot_trans](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations thus support the existence of a dynamic critical point in the bcc9r transition of cu nanoprecipitates . at this temperature , the nucleation barrier between the two phases disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic origin of this behavior lies in the mechanical instability of bulk bcc - cu on the one hand and the stabilization of a bcc wetting layer with stiff phonon modes at the interface with the bcc - fe host lattice on the other .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that while our observations can not prove the existence of a thermodynamic critical point ( tcp ) in the bcc9r transition of cu nanoprecipitates , they suggest that the phase diagrams of nanoprecipitates may contain tcps that have no counterpart in the corresponding bulk thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is of course well - known that the phase diagrams of nanoparticular systems deviate from the bulk due to confinement . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the loci of phase boundaries become size dependent and thus phase transition temperatures and pressures are modified for liquid - gas @xcite , liquid  </S>",
    "<S> solid @xcite as well as solid  solid transformations @xcite . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , dynamic critical points leading to vanishing hysteresis have been observed to precede the tcp in liquid - gas transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , one might expect the first - order character of transitions between phases with distinct symmetries to be conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a tcp in bcc9r transformations of cu nanoprecipitates violates this expectation . </S>",
    "<S> it is caused by the heterogeneous nature of nanoprecipitates , where the total latent heat can vanish with the core and wetting layer regions exhibiting compensating discontinuities . </S>",
    "<S> this heterogeneity is best illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profiles](e ) , which shows the total latent heat per atom , as well as the inner core and wetting layer energy differences between bcc and 9r precipitates . for temperatures above 500k , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution to the latent heat from the inner core region reaches its asymptotic limit . </S>",
    "<S> below this temperature , this contribution is slowly reduced as the inner core region is gradually shrinking and becoming strained . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : profiles](e ) demonstrates that the latent heat per atom can nearly vanish while significant differences in the energetics of bcc and 9r precipitates remain . </S>",
    "<S> this points to the fact that the balance between wetting layer and core energies is fundamental to the low - temperature criticality in this system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if a tcp existed , higher order derivatives of the free energy would become discontinuous rather than diverge .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology described in this work not only has direct consequences for our understanding of the fe  cu system but transpires to many more materials . </S>",
    "<S> based on the analysis presented here one can anticipate the occurrence of similar effects in other immiscible systems , whenever the minority phase is unstable in the lattice structure of the host . </S>"
