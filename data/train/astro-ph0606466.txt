    "soft x - ray emission has been detected from at least 20 comets since 1996 .",
    "after the consideration and rejection of several possible emission mechanisms , a consensus has been reached that the primary mechanism is charge exchange collisions between highly charged solar wind minor ions and neutral atoms and molecules of the cometary atmospheres , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the observations have been reviewed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) process also occurs in the heliosphere where it contributes to the soft x - ray background @xcite and may be responsible for some fraction of the short and long term enhancements seen at 250 ev @xcite .",
    "these recent , interesting observations indicate it is important to understand both the microphysics of the charge - exchange process and the phenomenology of where , when and how this process occurs within the solar system .",
    "theoretical models of the x - ray and euv emission lines produced in comets by charge exchange with the solar wind ions have been constructed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "observations of diffuse swcx emission other than from comets have been carried out using @xmath0 @xcite and xmm - newton @xcite . @xcite",
    "observe the optically dark side of the moon and attribute the x - rays they detect to charge exchange collisions between solar wind ions and neutral hydrogen in the earth s geocorona .",
    "@xcite ascribe the emission they see as coming from the earth s exosphere or the heliosphere . in both cases ,",
    "the emission is characterized by strong variability and correlation with the solar wind particle flux .",
    "x - rays generated by swcx have been detected from the atmospheres of mars and venus @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the highly - ionized , heavy ions that stream out in the solar wind are a potential source of soft x - ray and euv emission from within the solar system .",
    "charge exchange emission may occur involving neutral atoms and molecules from comets entering the inner solar system , planetary exospheres , and neutral atoms in the inter - planetary medium",
    ". a highly - ionized solar wind ion may give rise to several photons as the ion captures electrons sequentially in its flight from the sun .",
    "a detailed ionization and density map of the heavy solar wind ions as a function of time and position is required for a complete description of the x - ray and euv emissions in the solar system .",
    "measurements of swcx emission from comets ( and other measurements ) can provide a useful probe of the density and ion composition of the solar wind .",
    "many swcx lines are predicted to appear at euv energies below the low - energy limit of @xmath0 and xmm - newton ( kharchenko & dalgarno 2000 , 2001 , kharchenko et al .",
    "some of these euv lines arise from ions not conclusively identified from emission at higher energies .",
    "these lines may be detected with chips , a spectrometer sensitive in the euv with resolution of several hundred .",
    "the lines appear to be present in the rosat pspc spectrum of c/1990 k1 ( levy ) ( @xcite ) which rises steeply at energies below 200 ev .",
    "@xcite observed comet c/1996 b2 ( hyakutake ) at low resolution at euv wavelengths and claimed detection of lines from o , c , he and ne . at lower energies , @xcite predict that emission lines from the doublet at 1032 and 1038 a should be the brightest fuv lines swcx lines . a sensitive search for euv and fuv emission lines cometary swcx was conducted with the far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) observatory @xcite .",
    "@xcite report a a tentative detection of 1032  emission line from comet c/2000 wm1 ( linear ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation of this feature has been suggested by @xcite from in fuse observations of the brighter comet c/2001 q4 ( neat ) ; they attribute this feature to h@xmath4 fluorescent emission line pumped by radiation from and ions in the solar corona .",
    "the non - detection of the brightest fuv lines from swcx may be because the relatively small field of view of fuse allowed observation of only about 6000 - 7000 km around the cometary nucleus . for the q4 fuse observations ,",
    "the peak brightness of the charge - exchange euv and x - ray emissions was shifted by more than this amount from the comet center , hence the fuse aperture may have missed it @xcite .",
    "the favorable perigee passages of the bright comets c/2001 q4 neat and c/2002 t7 linear in may 2004 and machholz in january 2005 provided an excellent opportunity to use the unique low energy spectroscopic capabilities of chips to study swcx in comets at euv wavelengths . due to a combination of high solar activity and their close approaches , comets c/2001 q4 neat and c/2002 t7 linear are the brightest x - ray targets available since comet c / hyakutake in 1996 and comet 153p/2002 c1 ( ikeya - zhang ) in 2002 . in this paper , we discuss the observational data from chips and @xmath0 , describe the procedures by which we measure the line strengths and discuss the implications for the cometary charge exchange process .",
    "the chips orbit is approximately circular at 600 km and an inclination of 94 degrees , determined by the primary payload ( icesat ) of the rocket that launched the instrument .",
    "chips is sensitive to the euv band of 90 - 260  , or 47 - 138 ev . with all six slits open ,",
    "the spectrograph field of view is roughly rectangular at 5 by 25 degrees .",
    "any object smaller than a few degrees presents a `` point source '' to chips , and will be visible only through two of the slits at a time .",
    "the observations presented here were collected in wide - slit mode , with a peak resolution for diffuse light of about 3.4  fwhm , reaching about 4  at the edges of the bandpass .",
    "light from the comet enters the chips spectrograph through two slits , each 1 mm by 7 cm .",
    "the light diverges onto an 8 cm @xmath5 6 cm grazing incidence cylindrical diffraction grating with central groove density of 1800 lines mm@xmath3 .",
    "the groove density is varied across the grating surface to provide nearly stigmatic focusing in the dispersion direction near the center of the spectral band .",
    "thus , the spectral resolution near the center of the band is limited by the slit width . at the ends of the band ,",
    "the combined effects of optical aberration and defocusing contribute to the net spectral line width . for sources that are significantly smaller than the field - of - view of a slit ,",
    "the resolution is independent of the angular size of the comet .",
    "the grating rulings and baffling reject most non - euv light and thin - film filters placed close to the detector also attenuate out - of - band and scattered light .",
    "a diffuse emission line spans the full available detector height , typically passing through two different filter materials : aluminum , zirconium , or polyimide / boron .",
    "measurements of an emission line that has the appropriate ratio of line flux from the two different filters spanned by the line encourages the belief that an actual spectral line has been detected and not some detector artifact .    the chips in - orbit calibration is discussed in more detail in @xcite and additional details of the science instrument and the chipsat satellite are presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a summary of the chips observations of all three comets is presented in table 1 .",
    "we coadd individual comet observations in different subsets as described below .",
    "individual pointings are of @xmath620 minute duration and owing to the orbital geometry , nearly all observations took place while the satellite was on the day side of earth .",
    "the chips mission has a nominal constraint of 72 degrees for the minimum boresight - to - sun angle permitted during observations , both for spacecraft health reasons and to minimize the amount of scattered solar radiation entering the spectrometer .",
    "however , observing neat q4 and linear t7 near their time of maximum optical brightness required observations that violated this sun - angle constraint and required the development and use of a new observing mode to accommodate the smaller solar angles as well as observe a target moving in the sky .",
    "the two most important differences for this mode are a slightly reduced pointing accuracy and stability since the main sun sensor did not have the sun in the field of view and a possible increase in the amount of scattered solar euv radiation present in the comet spectra .",
    "initial data reduction was carried out using the pipeline that is described in @xcite .",
    "we apply several filters to the raw data in producing the reduced spectra .",
    "data are excluded when the overall detector count - rate exceeds 80 events / sec , indicative of high charged - particle backgrounds .",
    "data are also excluded when the detector high voltage is reduced ( a normal , temporary response to transient high - background periods ) .",
    "a broad pulse - height filter is applied by the flight software .",
    "approximately 40% of the telemetered events are then excluded by a low - pass pulse - height threshold in ground software , selectively reducing background because the low amplitude events are overwhelmingly triggered by charged particles rather than by photons .",
    "periodically pulsed `` stimulation pins '' outside the active field of view are used to register the event x , y coordinates to a common frame , thereby correcting for thermal drifts in the plate scale or axis zero - points , and to determine the effective observing time of the observation .",
    "distortion is corrected using a preflight pinhole grid map .",
    "small regions of known detector `` hot spots '' are excluded , the event coordinates are rotated so that the new x axis closely corresponds to the spectral dispersion direction , and the spectra in each filter - half are summed over the active detector height .",
    "once the final spectra ( one each from the upper and lower detector halves ) have been summed , these will typically contain counts from several background sources in addition to any signal from a comet .",
    "the primary backgrounds include particle events that are generally uniform across the detector , geocoronal he i 584  photons that are scattered by the gratings and penetrate the al filters , and for these comet observations , some euv photons from the sun that are multiply - scattered from some structure on the satellite into the spectrometer .",
    "these backgrounds must be properly accounted for or subtracted before we can assess the amount of radiation from the comets that may be present .",
    "we show in fig .  [ q4summed ] the summed spectra from all the individual neat q4 observations , totaling 329495 s of useful data .",
    "the upper curve is the polyboron / al side of the detector , while the lower trace is the zr / al side of the detector , lowered by 200 counts .",
    "the wavelength ranges of the various filters are indicated , as are the positions of the filter - supporting bars for each half .",
    "the continuum seen in the poly / b and zr filters is primarily from particle events , while the al filters show a significant additional smooth background from scattered geocoronal he i 584  photons .",
    "the effective area of the spectrometer as a function of wavelength is shown in @xcite .",
    "we add together signal from one or both halves of the detector at a particular wavelength based on the filter transmission curves to maximize signal - to - noise at that wavelength or to exclude artifacts .",
    "the ranges included from each filter / half are indicated in fig .",
    "[ q4summed ] .",
    "to determine the continuum against which to search for emission lines , we use a very deep flight charged - particle spectrum , scaled to match the local counts in the spectrum under analysis .",
    "the deep charged - particle spectrum generally contains many more events per wavelength interval than does the spectrum under analysis , and thus contributes relatively little to the shot noise in the line flux .",
    "differences in the technique by which the scale factor is determined  for example , heavy smoothing versus fitting low - order polynomials  result in changes of @xmath610% to the line flux results .",
    "to determine the absolute `` flatness '' of the detector response , we analyzed a pre - flight photon flat field that was histogrammed like the flight spectra .",
    "compared to a smooth polynomial , the flat field spectrum showed a pixel - to - pixel variance only slightly greater than expected for shot noise , where `` pixel '' refers to the width of the narrowest spectral features .",
    "the excess one - sigma variance above shot noise was about 0.3% of the total signal .",
    "this factor is negligible in all the limits reported here , where shot - noise from charged particles detected is the dominant uncertainty .",
    "we measure the line flux of an individual line by adding all the counts that occur within one spectral resolution element of the line rest wavelength , and subtracting the counts summed from the scaled background spectrum over the same limits .",
    "the wavelength scale is based on preflight measurements , offset by a ( constant ) @xmath61  determined from the bright geocoronal 256.3  feature , which is present in essentially all the observations .",
    "temporal variations in the measured centroid of the feature show a dispersion of about 0.2  .",
    "periodic observations of the moon , which provide a weakly reflected solar spectrum that includes lines of fe ix through xii , confirm that the adopted wavelength scale provides a good fit near the center of the spectral band , and support the view that the relative throughput of the filter panels is as measured pre - flight .",
    "the measured fluxes of both the feature and the lunar spectrum are in good agreement with pre - flight expectations , suggesting that the instrument throughput has not declined since laboratory calibration .",
    "the pre - flight laboratory throughput calibration , tied to an nist - calibrated diode , both at a component level and an end - to - end manner ( which agree to within @xmath610% ) provide the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the chipsat attitude control system ( acs ) is described in @xcite .",
    "the acs uses inputs from several sensors , include coarse and medium sun sensors , magnetic sensors , a lunar sensor , and reaction wheel rotation sensors to calculate the spacecraft attitude . during most of the observations",
    "reported here , chips was unable to use its most accurate source of attitude information , the spacecraft s medium sun sensor .",
    "instead , the adopted observing procedure was to orient the spacecraft such that the sun was in the sun sensor for the fraction of each orbit when a comet was not being observed , then slew to the comet during the period the comet was visible .",
    "when the sun sensor is used , the typical pointing accuracy of the spacecraft is within @xmath60.5 degrees of the requested target @xcite , and centered to within 1/10th of the spectrometer field - of - view .",
    "for relatively short periods even with slews , such as the length of a typical 25 minute comet observation , the spacecraft reaction wheels provide pointing orientation and knowledge with negligible degradation .",
    "this is confirmed by the very small attitude corrections that followed reaquisition of the sun by the medium sun sensor .    in the chips observations of the comets ,",
    "we conclude that essentially all of the euv - emitting region of the comet is contained within the chips entrance apertures during the observations .",
    "the field of view of the two central slits of chips is approximately five degrees square .",
    "comet positions were generated every 10 minutes during the period they were observed by chips using the minor plant and comet ephemeris service , where the requested pointing corresponded to the mid - point in time of each observation .",
    "parallax and the motion of the comet during an orbit s pointing are negligible compared with the chips field of view .",
    "our re - mapped image of q4 on the @xmath0 acis - s detector shows the x - ray emitting region to be no larger than 10 @xmath7 10 arcmin .",
    "given the attitude information and the size of the x - ray emitting region , we believe that the comets were positioned in the slit entrance aperture when the spacecraft reported it was pointed at the requested comet position and that the emitting region was fully contained within the chips field of view .",
    "hence , for the observations reported here , we assume no dilution factor for comet euv emission .",
    "the roll angle for observations was chosen such that the chips entrance slits were perpendicular to the great circle that contained both the comet and the sun .",
    "the majority of counts registered in the chips detectors are from charged particles entering the instrument .",
    "although some discrimination against particle events based on pulse height takes place as described above , the time - varying nature of this background makes it difficult to determine the presence of any continuum emission arising from photons .",
    "the net effect of the backgrounds and data reduction techniques is that chips is primarily sensitive to spectral lines , with a limiting sensitivity of a few line units or lu [ photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 ] for the observations described here .",
    "chips consistently detects at high significance he ii emission arising in the earth s geocorona at 256.3  and to a lesser degree at 243.0  .",
    "in addition , we observe radiation that appears to originate in the solar corona and is multiply scattered from surfaces on the spacecraft into the instrument .",
    "although this background is very faint compared with the interstellar medium emission lines from fe ix - xii that chips was designed to observe , we have studied it in depth because it is a signficant background to these measurements .",
    "the euv line emission from the interstellar medium reported by @xcite based on one year of chips observations are very faint and do not pose a significant background for the comet observations .",
    "a detailed study of the instrument - scattered background shows that the lines are never seen in co - added nighttime - only observations ; the spectrum appears very similar to the full moon spectrum ; the strength of the lines does not correlate with zenith angle ; the lines show no ram - angle dependence ; the lines appear reproducibly in only a relatively small number of spacecraft orientations relative to the sun ; the lines appear more often , but not always , when chips points closer to the sun than during normal observations , but there is not a significant anti - correlation with solar - target angle ; the line strengths show no correlation with the ultra low energy isotope spectrometer ( uleis ) @xcite measurements of fe ix , x and xi in the solar wind during the time of the comet observations ; and the line strengths during comet observations do not correlate with measurements of solar disk irradiance in the 170 - 230  by the solar euv experiment on timed ( see ) @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the source of these background lines is faintly - scattered radiation from the solar corona . owing to its appearance preferentially at smaller solar angles ,",
    "this background is therefore of more importance for the chips comet observations than during normal sky survey observations , which are made at larger solar angles .",
    "[ moonspec ] shows the co - added lunar spectrum observed by chips in narrow slit mode from several months in 2003 , and the co - added spectrum from a number of observations when the background lines were strongest .",
    "the similarity of the spectra is evident , although we would not expect identical spectra because the solar spectrum itself varies and the scattered spectrum was taken in wide - slit mode , which is more sensitive to the scattered radiation and has lower spectral resolution .",
    "we can nonetheless use either the moon spectrum or the co - added bright background times as a template to indicate the possible presence of solar - scattered lines in the following way .",
    "we developed this indicator by first subtracting the continuum level from the scattered light spectrum after fitting it with a polynomial .",
    "we then similarly fit and subtract the continuum from another chips observation .",
    "when the two continuum - subtracted spectra are multiplied together in the region of the lines , the template acts as a matched filter sensitive to the solar lines .",
    "we call the exposure time - normalized product of the two spectra integrated over the spectral region 170 - 230  the `` line flux indicator , '' or lfi .",
    "we find lfi to be a sensitive indicator of the presence of scattered solar light in co - added observations and can use it to reject data that contains this background where required .",
    "the third trace in fig .",
    "[ moonspec ] is co - added daytime data selected for low lfi and shows essentially no solar contamination .",
    "however , in most cases we measure only upper limits to the spectral lines expected from charge exchange reactions , so that the presence of a possible solar background is of less concern than it would be were cx lines detected .",
    "additionally , the cx lines we are trying to detect form an only partially overlapping set with the lines emerging from the solar corona .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ lfi ] the relative lfi value for each day of the q4 and t7 chips observations .",
    "we also show the scaled magnitude of the solar 170 - 230  flux of the sun as measured by see , which does not correlate with the lfi values .",
    "finally , we also show a model visual brightness of the two comets , where the variation is based only on the inverse - squared distances from the earth to the comet and the comet to the sun .",
    "the latter curves indicate that we observed q4 through its peak brightness , while the t7 observations were only possible as the brightness declined , since the comet was too close to the sun in the sky to observe prior to that time . owing to the sensitivity level of the chips data , it is not useful to subdivide the data into different time slices to investigate possible time variation of the emission .",
    "c/2001 q4 ( neat ) was observed by @xmath0 may 12 , 2004 using director s discretionary time .",
    "the total approved observation of 10 ks was divided into 3 pointings of approximately equal length . during each observation",
    "the telescope was held fixed and the comet allowed to drift through the field of view .",
    "the comet was centered on the s3 chip which has the best low energy response .",
    "the three resultant standard level 2 event lists were simultaneously concatenated and reprojected into a fixed `` comet - centered '' frame of reference using the ciao tool `` sso_freeze '' .",
    "the final reconstructed image provides good spatial ( @xmath60.5\" / pixel ) and spectral information ( @xmath950 ev ) .",
    "a source spectrum was extracted from a circular aperture with radius of 700 pixels ( 5.8@xmath10 ) centered on the peak of the comet emission and the background spectra was extracted from the area outside the source aperture .",
    "we examined how varying the aperture radius changed the comet and background spectrum .",
    "the aperture radius we chose included essentially all of the emission from the comet ; outside of this radius we expect that heliospheric swcx will be a uniform background on this scale .",
    "the background spectrum normalized by area was subtracted from the in - aperture spectrum to produce the q4 comet spectrum .",
    "work by @xcite and @xcite shows the cx x - ray emission from a comet as active as q4 may be offset from the nucleus by 30,000 - 40,000 km . at the distance of 0.6 au where q4 was observed with @xmath0 , this separation translates to an angle of @xmath61 arcminute .",
    "owing to the diffuse nature of the emission and the positional uncertainty induced by the photon remapping it is not clear whether we can discern a potential offset of this magnitude from the center of the nucleus , but we have verified that the spectrum resulting from our chosen aperture radius is insensitive to a potential offset of this size . a detailed discussion of the q4 x - ray emission morphology will be covered in @xcite .",
    "acis response matrices to model the instrument effective area and energy dependent sensitivity were created with the standard ciao tools and the resulting spectra were fit using xspec .",
    "fig .  [ q4summed ] shows the comet c/2001 q4 ( neat ) spectrum from 50 - 270  measured with chips . for each potentially strong charge exchange spectral line indicated in the figure",
    ", we measure the brightness using the spectra from one or both halves of the chips detector .",
    "we have run our line flux measuring algorithm for each comet and the results of these measurements are shown in table 2 .",
    "we include two measurements using q4 data : the `` no lfi '' set refers to the period may 9 - 19 , 2004 corresponding to a time when the lfi measurement indicates minimal contamination from scattered solar euv radiation .",
    "we also present the limits from a spectrum consisting of the co - added spectra from all three comets , which contains the lowest relative shot noise background .",
    "we measure positive flux at the wavelengths of a number of potential charge exchange lines , albeit at low significance .",
    "fe lines at wavelengths 170 - 220  are detected in several of the spectra at significances ranging to 5 @xmath11 . since it is likely that much or all of this emission is solar rather than cometary , we restrict our consideration to possible charge exchange lines shortward of 170  , although line measurements that may have a solar component provide upper limits to the cometary emissions .",
    "we estimate that the lines for which we report limits in the table contribute about 90% of the flux from charge exchange if we ignore the iron lines .",
    "the least contaminated spectrum is that obtained from the neat q4 data selected for low lfi and the most significant line is the line at 129.91  , at almost 2@xmath11 , arising from the 1s4d @xmath12d - 1s2p @xmath12p transition .    in fig .",

    "the line profiles were taken to be gaussian with widths equal to the wavelength - dependent resolution of chips .",
    "the free parameters in the fit were a quintic polynomial to find the background level and an overall amplitude for the lines , with the individual line ratios fixed .",
    "the results when this technique was applied to the neat q4 `` no lfi '' spectrum are that the line amplitudes are consistent with zero .",

    "the most interesting chips measurement of the swcx lines is the 2 sigma detection in the neat q4 `` no - lfi '' spectrum of the line of ovi at 95.5 ev or 130 a. discrepancies at lower energies are affected by scattered radiation from the sun .",
    "we conclude that the swcx model euv predictions are consistent with the chips data , but the instrument lacks the sensitivity needed to systematically test the theoretical predictions .",
    "in that chips was not designed for measurements of comets , or point sources , the limited agreement supports the swcx model and points out some additional utility of the chips measurements .",
    "the model also predicts that the 10 brightest euv lines in the chips band contribute 65% of all the euv photons , and 88% of the euv photon flux is contained in the brightest 26 lines .",
    "the accumulated yield is useful in providing an estimate of the photon energy distribution from comets .",
    "it is defined as the total number of photons produced by charge exchange in collisions of the solar wind with comets with energies lying between a minimum energy , equal to 47 ev for chips , and a maximum energy e. the accumulated yield is dimensionless .",
    "multiplied by the product of the solar wind flux and ion density it yields the volume emissivity .",
    "7 shows the calculated accumulated yield for comet neat q4 as a function of photon energy e for a minimum energy of 47 ev .",
    "multiplying it by a factor of 26 yields the accumulated photon flux in units of @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "the small values reflect the low fractional abundances of the heavy solar wind ions .",
    "we have measured euv emission from three comets and provided the first - ever simultaneous euv and x - ray measurement and modeling of cometary swcx emission .",
    "the x - ray data for comet q4 show clear emission lines that are satisfactorily interpreted as solar wind charge exchange lines from ions expected in the solar wind .",
    "we have used the same model to identify and predict the strengths of euv lines .",
    "the measured euv line strengths are consistent with the theoretical model that reproduces the x - ray line intensities .",
    "the chips data and model results show that the euv lines from all three comets are quite faint .",
    "nonetheless , the high spectral resolution measurements of the euv lines have now set useful limits on many emission lines in this band that may serve as a guide for future euv observations of comets .",
