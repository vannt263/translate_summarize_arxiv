    "recent advances in experimental techniques have resulted in rapidly growing attention to the dynamics of particular nonstationary states , wave packets . with tunable , short and intensive laser pulses",
    "a creation and analysis of such states in atomic and molecular systems became available .",
    "an extensive research by means of both theoretical and experimental methods has brought an understanding of the intriguing phenomena of a hierarchy of collapses and revivals for particularly prepared wave packets in rydberg atoms @xmath01 - 7@xmath1 $ ] and in jaynes ",
    "cummings model ( jcm ) of quantum optics @xmath08 - 12@xmath1 $ ] . in hydrogen and hydrogenoid atoms electrons",
    "can be excited to a coherent mixture of many rydberg states that move almost classically for many kepler periods @xmath01 - 5,7@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "however due to a nonequidistant spectrum of energy levels wave packets undergo a sequence of spreadings , collapses and revivals during long term evolution .",
    "there exist several time scales for the revivals ( reccurences ) .",
    "the shortest one is associated with the period of a classical motion , i.e. kepler period , the other ones called @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( revival and superrevival times respectively ) arise from subtle quantum interference effects .",
    "the examples of such effects are described in more detail in section 2 .    in atomic systems",
    "the appropriate wave packet can be excited by a suitably chosen laser pulse @xmath02,6@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "the time evolution can be then probed by the following pulse after precisely measured time delay .",
    "using additionally a circularily polarized electric field allows for a creation of electronics wave packets which are stationary @xmath013,14@xmath1 $ ] . in this case the wave packet motion is stabilized by a nonlinear coupling in the analogous way as orbits of trojan asteroids are stabilized in the celestial mechanics @xmath015@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "another interesting phenomenon already observed in quantum optics is an atomic analogue to a double  slit experiment @xmath016@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "again in hydrogen or hydrogenoid atoms one can excite , by a pair of laser pulses with an appropriate time delay , two wave packets localized on the opposite sides of the orbit . such a state is often called a schrdinger cat state as it is a mesoscopic size realization of the famous schrdinger cat problem @xmath017@xmath1 $ ] . in the following sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss the new dynamical structures in wave packet motion .",
    "these new effects arise when the strong enough spin ",
    "orbit interaction is present in a physical system . in order to exhibit these effects in the most transparent way we have chosen the simple central potential in spherical harmonic oscillator form .",
    "this choice allows for the factorization of the evolution operator into two parts and for considering the orbital motion and spin  orbit motion separately , as well as for finding analytical solutions for both motions . in section 3",
    "we present the spin ",
    "orbit pendulum effect @xmath018 - 20@xmath1 $ ] which is most pronounced for circular orbits .",
    "section 4 contains the discussion of linear trajectories for which spin  orbit interaction spreads ( periodically ) the initially spherical , well localized wave packet into a toroidal object , with a classical trajectory being the symmetry axis of the torus .",
    "such behaviour of the wave packet has been presented here for the first time .",
    "all these experimental and theoretical achievements enrich our understanding of the basic features of quantum mechanics .",
    "the discussion presented in this section is in line of that of @xmath03,5,7,22@xmath1 $ ] . consider a hydrogen atom prepared in such a way that the wave function is a superposition of bound - state eigenfunctions @xmath4 where coefficients @xmath5 are not negligible only for rather narrow range of @xmath6 around the mean value @xmath7 .",
    "obviously @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this sum converges , therefore a finite number of @xmath5 makes it arbitrarily close to 1 and is sufficient to represent @xmath10 with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "then any @xmath10 is arbitrarily close to a periodic function of time @xmath023@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath11 be the common multiple of all @xmath6 for which @xmath5 are not neglected .",
    "then @xmath10 has a period @xmath12 .",
    "the recurrence with this period is exact , but if many levels contribute to the sum ( 1 ) the required time is enormously long .",
    "however , nearly exact recurrences occur considerably earlier .",
    "the assumption that weights @xmath5 are strongly centered around a mean value @xmath7 permits an expansion of the energy in a taylor series @xmath13 where each prime on @xmath14 denotes a derivative .",
    "the derivative terms in ( 2 ) define distinct time scales that depend on @xmath15 : @xmath16 , called classical period , revival time and superrevival time , respectively . keeping terms through third order and disregarding an overall time ",
    "dependent phase , one can rewrite ( 1 ) as @xmath17}\\;.\\ ] ]    the convenient measure of the degree of recurrences is the recurrence probability ( also referred to as autocorrelation function ) , where @xmath18 and time units are atomic units , @xmath19 in order to exhibit some properties of short term and long term evolution let us construct in a standard way the so  called circular wave packet @xmath01 - 4@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "then we can choose @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 ( aligned standard hydrogenic eigenfunction with @xmath22 ) .",
    "the features of the evolution of such a circular wave packet are illustrated below with some numerical examples .",
    "we show the results obtained for the wave packet with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the summation over @xmath6 taken from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . for this case @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the mean",
    "principal quantum number @xmath7 is large enough for the fractional revivals to appear .",
    "the short term evolution ( time range 050@xmath29 ) is displayed in fig .  1 , where the recurrence probability ( 4 ) is plotted as function of time .",
    "initial peak intensity decreases very fast , and it is seen that after 4 revolutions wave packet is well spread over the whole orbit . around @xmath30 ( 1/4 of @xmath2 )",
    "peaks appear 4 times more frequently indicating formation of a fractional revival of 1/4 order ( see also fig .",
    "3b ) . around @xmath31 ( 1/3 of @xmath2 ) and @xmath32 ( 1/2 of @xmath2 ) the frequency of peaks of the autocorrelation function",
    "indicate formations of the fractional revivals of orders 1/3 and 1/2 , respectively ( shapes of the wave packets are shown in fig .",
    "3c and 3d ) . the",
    "so  called full revivals are built at times close to @xmath33 and @xmath34 and a corresponding shape of the wave packet is exhibited in fig .",
    "2 displays the same autocorrelation function ( 4 ) but in a much longer scale . the formation of recurrences corresponding to @xmath3 at @xmath35 i.e. @xmath36 and to some extent to @xmath37 i.e. @xmath38 respectively is clearly seen .",
    "the corresponding shape of the wave packet at first superrevival occurence is present in fig .",
    "in this section we discuss the properties of the time evolution of wave packets representing a fermion moving in a spherical harmonic oscillator potential with a strong spin  orbit coupling .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is then a simplified form of the single ",

    "@xmath018 - 21@xmath1 $ ] , here we review briefly the main results . in order to make the discussion simpler let us first focus attention on a particular case of circular orbits .",
    "explicitly , we choose ( without any loss of generality ) the @xmath40 plane as the orbit plane and @xmath41 as the initial spin direction ( initial spin in orbit s plane ) . then the initial states take the following explicit form @xmath42 where the eigenstate of @xmath43 is expressed explicitly by the eigenstates of @xmath44 operator ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 is the coherent state of spherical harmonic oscillator corresponding to a circular orbit . in configuration space",
    "it has the form @xmath48}\\ , \\text{e}^{\\text{i}x_0y}\\;. { \\rm{e}}^{-\\frac{1}{2}[(x - x_0)^2+y^2+z^2]}\\ , { \\rm{e}}^{{\\rm{i}}p_0y}\\;.\\ ] ] this packet has its maximum at ( @xmath49,0,0 ) and moves along the circular orbit if @xmath50=@xmath49=@xmath51 , @xmath7  the average value of @xmath6 quantum number ( in this case average values of @xmath52 are @xmath53=@xmath7 , respectively ) .",
    "note that the length of the angular momentum is also @xmath7 in these units .",
    "the state @xmath47 can be decomposed in the ho basis as @xmath54 i.e.  it is a linear combination of states with @xmath55=@xmath56 and @xmath6=@xmath56 .",
    "this particular state which combines all the partial waves and consequently evolves during the time evolution with the spin ",
    "orbit coupling by using all the frequencies of the spin  orbit partners , can be taken as ` pseudo ' one - dimensional harmonic oscillator coherent state if one defines the weights @xmath57 in terms of @xmath56 and a ( continuous ) real variable @xmath7 as a poisson distribution @xmath58 and @xmath59 commute , the evolution operator connected with the hamiltonian ( 5 ) can be factorized as @xmath60 where the appropriate time units are chosen to absorb @xmath61 and @xmath62 . using the equality @xmath63 in the expansion of @xmath64",
    "one can rearrange it as @xmath65 where , with the initial condition @xmath66 , @xmath67 \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath68 \\;.\\ ] ] in the last equations @xmath69=@xmath70 and states @xmath71 are its eigenstates with the eigenvalues @xmath72 .",
    "the formulae ( 1013 ) applied to ( 6 ) give the analytical form of the wave packet as a function of time . in the limit of high @xmath7 ( which in practice is achieved already for @xmath73 )",
    "we can provide a simple explanation of the dynamics . in this limit",
    "we obtain @xmath74 where the components of the spinor are given as @xmath75 and @xmath76 each component is again a coherent state that moves on a circular orbit of radius @xmath49 , with angular velocities @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "there is in @xmath79 an overall phase @xmath80 which produces at time @xmath81 the simple result @xmath82 , which means that a pure state with spin along @xmath83 is then observed .    these features are shown in details in fig .  4 where the spatial motion of the wave packet ( 6 - 8 ) is plotted ( more precisely only evolution under @xmath84 operator ( 11 ) ) .",
    "the figure displays the total probability density @xmath85 for the case @xmath86 at times @xmath87 , @xmath88 . as motion",
    "is periodic the motion in the second half of the @xmath89 period is symmetric to that of the first half .",
    "5 illustrates the motion in the spin subspace .",
    "it displays time dependence of the @xmath90 and tr@xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the density matrix reduced to the spin subspace .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath93 are accompanied by the corresponding oscillations of @xmath94 as the total angular momentum is conserved in the system .",
    "this effect of a periodic exchange of the portion of angular momentum between the spin and the ordinary subspaces has been called _ spin  orbit pendulum _ @xmath018,19@xmath1 $ ] . for analytical formulas and",
    "an extensive discussion see @xmath018,19@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "in this section we want to discuss the same physical system with the hamiltonian ( 5 ) but quite different initial conditions corresponding to linear classical motion .",
    "more precisely we consider initial states in the form ( 6 ) but with the shape in configuration space at time @xmath95 given by @xmath96}\\ , \\text{e}^{\\text{i}x_0y}\\;. { \\rm{e}}^{-\\frac{1}{2}[(x - x_0)^2+y^2+z^2 ] } \\;.\\ ] ] this is the gaussian wave packet at rest centered at ( @xmath49,0,0 ) , @xmath97 , which in ho potential moves along @xmath41 axis with average value of the angular momentum equal zero ( note that according to ( 6 ) spin direction is the same ) .",
    "the decomposition into the ho basis is more general @xmath98 are known analytically for arbitrary initial conditions ( for details see eq .",
    "( 55 ) of ref .",
    "$ ] and related discussion ) . again with ( 10 - 13 ) and ( 17 )",
    "one can derive the analytical formulas for the time evolution .",
    "the details of this analytical formulation in terms of time dependent partial waves will be published elsewhere @xmath025@xmath1 $ ] .",
    "the examples of the motion of the wave packet with the lowest value of anglar momentum ( @xmath99 ) are shown in figs . 6 and 7 . such a wave packet in absence of the spin ",
    "orbit coupling ( @xmath100 ) moves along the piece of the straight line on @xmath101 axis .",
    "both figures display only this part of the evolution which is governed by the @xmath84 operator , i.e. the harmonic oscillator motion is frozen .",
    "both figures clearly show that the wave packet , initially well localized spreads into a torus ( more precisely into two tori , the second with much lower density ) with the classical trajectory being the symmetry axis .",
    "this spreading is reversible in our system due to its integrability and periodicity .",
    "such vortex rings topology of wave packets is presented here for the first time .",
    "the full motion is a superposition of spin  orbit motion and harmonic oscillator motion ( 10 ) .",
    "we have shown here that the presence of a spin - orbit interaction in a single  particle hamiltonian generates a new mechanism of collapses and revivals in wave packet dynamics . assuming that initial state of a fermion is prepared in a form of a gaussian wave packet ( a coherent state of harmonic oscillator ) with well determined spin projection we are able to calculate its evolution in analytical terms . there",
    "exist some initial conditions for which formulas become compact and transparent , and can serve as a guidance for the most general cases .",
    "there are two extremes : the case @xmath102 which corresponds to a circular classical orbit and the case @xmath99 corresponding to a linear orbit . in our simple model the constant form factor for spin  orbit coupling allows for a factorization of the evolution operator into two commuting parts .",
    "this fact makes possible considering both parts of the full motion separately and understand it better . the evolution operator @xmath84 , connected with the spin  orbit interaction results in splitting a wave packet into up and down components that evolve in a different manner .",
    "the so  called wave packet collapse reflects the vanishing overlap between subpackets . at @xmath103 the subpackets overlap again ( exactly in the limit of high @xmath7 ) , with the opposite phases and the wave packet revives with spin reversed . at times",
    "@xmath104 the subpackets overlap exactly with the same phases and the initial state is exactly rebuilt .",
    "the sequence of collapses and revivals is accompanied by oscillations of average values of spin and orbital angular momentum , the so  called _ spin  orbit pendulum _ effect .",
    "this behaviour is common for any initial condition providing that spin is initially in orbit s plane .    in the hydrogenoid atoms it is necessary to combine the properties of rydberg wave packets described in section 2 with the spin - orbit evolution that we have derived . in this way",
    "we obtain a complicated interference patern in which the time scale due to the spin - orbit interaction must be included .",
    "no simple description has emerged yet .",
