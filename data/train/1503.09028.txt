    "the straight blue line represents the theoretical result for the ctrw .",
    "[ biaspic ] ]    for an explanation of the long time behaviour of the fptd in a quenched energy landscape we use a result from the theory of brownian random walks , according to which the number of jumps @xmath132 is proportional to the time @xmath11 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the brownian survival probability in the semi - infinite domain is @xmath206 , and thus we obtain @xmath207 using equation ( [ weaksubbreak ] ) , we expect for the quenched energy landscape that @xmath208 one can clearly see the predicted power law in our simulations in figure [ agevsnoage ] ( right ) .",
    "interestingly , the unbiased random walk in a quenched energy landscape exhibits no detectable ageing , unlike the random walk in a completely random energy landscape ( figure [ agevsnoage ] , graph on the left ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quenched energy landscape features only a comparatively small sample of random variables relative to the annealed landscape or a continuous time random walk drawn from the power law waiting time distribution ( [ pwrlw ] ) .",
    "ageing enters the system because of immobilisation of the walker for extremely long waiting times .",
    "such extreme events are found in the large sample of random waiting times in a ctrw or in an annealed random landscape , but much fewer realisations occur in the finite qel .",
    "these ageing qel trajectories are statistically negligible , as reflected in the fptd observed here .    , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , and averaging is taken over @xmath214 runs .",
    "the straight lines are the theoretical results ( [ fptsemi ] ) , the short black lines indicate the respective power laws ( [ 3scale ] ) and ( [ qpwrlw ] ) .",
    "the intermediate regime in the annealed landscape is too small to see the corresponding power law .",
    "[ agevsnoage ] ]",
    "we studied the first passage time distribution of an ageing ctrw in three important scenarios , namely the semi - infinite case with and without external bias , and the confined case .",
    "we presented the relevant details of the derivation of the exact form of the first passage time densities and extended our long time approximations from ref .",
    "@xcite to the asymmetric confined case and to the range @xmath3 of the waiting time scaling exponent . in the second part of the paper",
    "we show that a different scaling regime appears in a quenched energy landscape , which converges to the ctrw regime with an increasing bias towards the absorbing boundary .",
    "the efficiency of the first passage is generally reduced by ageing .",
    "this effect is not only found in subdiffusive processes but is shown to exist even for waiting times of the form ( [ pwrlw ] ) with @xmath90 .",
    "even though the corresponding ctrw shows normal behaviour , we can find an aged scaling regime in the strongly aged fptd , which persists for many decades .",
    "for @xmath215 , we find no ageing in the unbiased semi - infinite domain , but ageing exists in the bounded domain as well as for biased diffusion .",
    "the ageing effects are so strong , that even a short ageing time is enough to overcome the effects of asymmetry in a confined domain .",
    "the starting position of a particle in a box becomes ( almost ) irrelevant in the observable regimes .",
    "we find , that the process is accelerated in a quenched energy landscape , which counters the slowing down of ageing .",
    "in fact , ageing can not be observed in a quenched energy landscapes without bias due to the finite sample of energy wells .",
    "the slope in the long time limit changes to @xmath216 , but if a bias is introduced , the correlations are overcome and the ctrw regime is recovered excellently .",
    "first passage times are an important quantity for the evaluation of experiments and simulations , as they can be easily obtained and can also be used as diagnostic tools of stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "ageing is especially important in biophysics , condensed matter physics and geophysics exhibiting ctrw behaviour , where it corresponds to an immobilisation of particles in crowded cells , changing characteristics of electrical currents in amorphous semiconductors or decreased chemical release rates in groundwater aquifers .",
    "we extended the existing results on ageing fptds and examined the behaviour in quenched energy landscapes , which are a realistic model for many 1d problems .",
    "future work could deal with the problem of first passage in higher dimensions ( crossing a plane or barrier ) . also , it would be interesting to investigate the transition from biased non - ageing quenched energy landscapes to ageing ctrw motion with increasing bias .",
    "another interesting related topic , the ageing scher - montroll transport , is and was examined theoretically @xcite and also in time - of - flight experiments @xcite .",
    "the experiments in amorphous semiconductors promise excellent testing conditions for the ctrw model for charge carrier transport , as the age of the material can be reliably controlled . in groundwater systems",
    "@xcite the first passage times can be tracked over several decades , so that crossovers between different scaling regimes could be resolved with good resolution . in different systems ,",
    "our results for the crossover times and scaling laws of different power law regimes could be used to determine the age @xmath2 or the stochastic nature of the underlying process .",
