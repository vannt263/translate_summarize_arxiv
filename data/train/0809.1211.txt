    "coherent laser fields can be used to manipulate atomic and molecular quantum states in order to create coherent superpositions of quantum states , which are of interest in many important fields of research including laser cooling @xcite , ultra cold matter @xcite , dark states @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , and laser driven states @xcite .",
    "these techniques have many important applications at the forefront of technology and industry , including in such areas as lithography @xcite , quantum information @xcite , quantum chemistry sha03 , and others .",
    "typically , control of quantum states is implemented within @xmath0-type and @xmath1-type systems driven by two ( or more ) laser fields . in the case of @xmath0-type excitation ,",
    "dark ( or population trapping ) states ( @xmath2-states ) can be formed , which become transparent for photons and thus cease interacting with light @xcite . in contrast , another type of superposition of coherent states , bright states ( @xmath3-states ) , becomes more absorbing under the laser light action @xcite .",
    "the dark states are useful in laser cooling processes @xcite , optical pumping @xcite , lasing without inversion  @xcite , and others .",
    "one particular application of dark states is in the method of stimulated adiabatic raman passage ( stirap ) , which can be used to couple an initial and final state to a common intermediate state and transfer atomic populations between initial and final state without loss @xcite .",
    "this method has traditionally required highly stabilized laser fields that are strongly phase correlated . but are these requirements really so strict as traditionally thought ? in this article",
    "we discuss a scheme which allows one to achieve high degree of control of quantum states by means of broad - band ( i.e. , basically white ) light from a single light source .",
    "the basic equation that describes coherent processes in light ",
    "atom interaction under the density matrix formalism is the liouville equation , which in atomic physics often is referred to by the term optical bloch equations .",
    "when these equations describe a system illuminated by spectrally broad light , they formally allow a steady - state solution that has the structure of a pure quantum state similar to the solution for dark states in monochromatic laser fields .",
    "it turns out that spectrally broad light can form dark states thanks to a beneficial cancellation of photons of different frequencies .",
    "this result evidently opens new possibilities for controlling atomic states with incoherent light sources . as a specific case",
    ", we will discuss in detail the problem of transferring a population of atoms with spectrally broad light from an initial , stable discrete state to a desired target state , without loss of population .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ problem ]",
    "we shall review the most optimal scenario for population transfer ; we discuss the nature of coherent dark states under monochromatic excitation and outline the main factors of the atom  coherent light interaction that can destroy the @xmath2-states by mixing them with bright states . in section [ phase ]",
    "we shall consider cases that limit the control over coherence , such as two lasers that are only partially coherent .",
    "we will then be in a position to formulate the arguments for and against the possibility of using spectrally broad light to manipulate quantum states .",
    "the answer will be obtained in section [ dark ] . in section [ equation ]",
    "we shall analyze the master equation for the density matrix that describes the dynamics of the atom  spectrally broad light interaction @xcite . in section [ states ]",
    "we shall demonstrate the existence of @xmath2-states under spectrally broad light excitation and coherent processes with broad band excitation .",
    "then , in section [ whitestirap ] we shall present the results of numerical simulations that demonstrate that population transfer by spectrally broad light can achieve an efficiency of 100 @xmath4 .",
    "the effects of detuning from the two - photon resonance will be analyzed in section [ zeeman ] , and numerical simulations of the corresponding two photon line shapes will be presented . in section [ concl ]",
    "we will summarize the results and discuss the possibilities of coherent processes in atoms in the case of spectrally broad light excitation . finally , in order to justify some statements related to @xmath2-states and stirap in the case of spectrally broad light sources , an analogy between coherent and incoherent process for quantum state control is established in the appendix .",
    "[ fig1 ]     we shall concentrate ourselves on the problem of how to transfer populations of atoms from an initial level @xmath5 to some target level @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) without loss of population . we first briefly recall the case of two coherent , _ monochromatic _ pulsed lasers , a pump laser and a stokes laser , with fixed frequencies @xmath7 , @xmath8 and corresponding rabi frequencies @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that , in any atom manipulation scheme , one should avoid involving the unstable upper - lying state @xmath11 , because from this state population could flow into other unwanted states , which are schematically depicted in figure  1 as a single level @xmath12 .",
    "our first task is to find how to create a wave functions @xmath13 as a linear combination of the two low - lying states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which is not coupled to the excited state @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "if the hamiltonian is @xmath14 , where @xmath1 describes the coupling of the system levels with light , we require that the matrix element @xmath15 is zero .      in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , the total hamiltonian @xmath16 of the system depicted in fig .  1 has the well known form @xcite :    @xmath17\\ ] ]    in the basis of the bare states @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath20 corresponds to a free atom and determines the bare state energies @xmath21 .",
    "we choose as the zero level of energy the value @xmath22 for the excited state @xmath11 .",
    "the quantities @xmath23 in the diagonal elements give the laser detunings ( @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ) from the bohr frequencies @xmath26 , @xmath27 of the corresponding optical transitions ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the rabi frequencies @xmath9 , @xmath28 are determined from the coupling term @xmath1 of the hamiltonian .",
    "we neglect to mention here any relaxation terms and leave their proper discussion to sec.[dark ] .",
    "the required solution @xmath29 of the equation @xmath30 reads @xcite :    @xmath31    and is known as a dark state . since @xmath29 does not share the population with the excited state , it does not radiate directly itself .",
    "note that the mixing angle @xmath32 gives a convenient measure of population sharing between stable states : the value @xmath33 corresponds to a population that resides entirely in state @xmath5 , while @xmath34 describes a population that has been transferred entirely to the target state @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig2 ]     since controlling the population means controlling the mixing angle , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , an efficient transfer of population can be achieved by organizing a sequence of dark states with the mixing angle varying from @xmath35 ( the initial state @xmath5 populated ) to @xmath36 ( the target state @xmath6 populated ) . in this sequence of states",
    ", the state vector @xmath37 should be maintained as the current dark states @xmath38 all the time .",
    "an experimental implementation of such a scenario is depicted in fig .  2 . the pulse sequence that provides the desired rotation of the mixing angle seems counter - intuitive @xcite : the pump laser pulse arrives after the stokes laser pulse !",
    "what happens is that the stokes laser prepares ( dresses ) the transition @xmath39 for accepting the population , which is delivered by the pump laser @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the states @xmath40 share the population equally at the moment when both lasers rabi frequencies are equal .",
    "we now examine different unwanted factors that can restrict the efficiency of the desired population transfer . for this purpose",
    ", we consider another convenient concept , the so called bright state ( @xmath3-state ) @xmath41 klaas :    @xmath42    which is orthogonal to the dark state @xmath43 .",
    "although the @xmath3-state also does not contain the excited state @xmath11 , it is always mixed with the excited state by the light fields , as can seen from the corresponding matrix element presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "having been coupled to the excited state , the @xmath3-state thus is power broadened , and this coupling leads to radiation from state @xmath11 , which results in unwanted population losses to the marginal levels @xmath12 due to spontaneous transitions ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "as was mentioned above , although the @xmath2-state is not coupled to state @xmath11 and does not lead to radiation from that state , nevertheless it may be coupled with the bright state .",
    "the mixing frequency between the bright and dark states during the system s temporal evolution reads @xcite :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , and the temporal derivative corresponds to non - adiabatic linkage between states .",
    "two important requirements follow from relation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "first , to preserve the dark state , changes of the mixing angle ( see eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ) should be slow enough , or adiabatically organized .",
    "the corresponding criterion is given via the inequality @xmath46 , which yields , after integration over @xmath47 klaas :    @xmath48    it is seen that the applied laser pulses should be stronger than the @xmath49-pulses . the second important requirement concerning the mixing of @xmath50- and @xmath2-states is that the difference @xmath51 between laser detunings should be small . this difference @xmath52 ( see fig .  1 ) is often called the double - photon detuning , and it opens a pathway for unwanted population flow , which may dramatically destroy the @xmath2-state .",
    "a detailed study of the efficiency of stirap - like processes as a function of @xmath52 ( the so called two - photon line shape ) may be found in romanenko .",
    "note that the one photon detuning @xmath53 , determined as @xmath54 ( see fig .  1 ) , does not enter itself into the mixing matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , which explains the weak influence of @xmath53 on the population transfer @xcite .      up to now we dealt with coherent radiation . however , in the real world , lasers typically are subject to vibrations and other environmental influences that cause phase diffusion and result in only partial coherence of the laser fields .",
    "phase diffusion effects were studied in detail by leonid using the phase diffusion model , according to which the random walk of laser frequencies varies chaotically both the double - photon detuning @xmath55 and the single - photon detuning @xmath53 .",
    "drift of the one photon detuning is not detrimental to stirap , but strong @xmath52-chaotic jumps dramatically decrease the stirap efficiency .",
    "however , the authors of paper knight pointed out an important exception : if the radiation in both laser fields has the same source , a beneficial cancelation of the phase fluctuations may occur .",
    "since laser phases are varying equally , the value of @xmath52 remains equal to zero .",
    "with the above preliminaries , we are now ready to determine if quantum states can be controlled by means of spectrally broad light instead of coherent lasers . from section [ phase ]",
    "it is clear that in case of spectrally broad light one has to use a single light source .",
    "otherwise , if two distinct uncorrelated sources of broad - band light were to be used , every dark state would be depopulated by mutual , multiple incoherences among the sources . in our analysis",
    "we deal with a fluctuating electric field @xmath56 that has a well defined elliptical polarization :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the carrier frequency of the light .",
    "we assume that the fluctuating part @xmath59 of the light is a scalar , dimensionless , random , complex function of unit modulus @xmath60 with the broadband correlation function @xmath61 . as a result ,",
    "the spectral distribution @xmath62 of the light @xcite",
    "@xmath63    is a smoothly varying function within the spectral interval @xmath64 of interest .",
    "the application of adiabatic elimination procedure implies the following requirement @xmath65 for the characteristic duration @xmath66 of the matter / light interaction , which is directly related to the time of switching on and switching off the light beam @xcite .",
    "when the interaction takes place during a very short time interval , i.e. , when @xmath67 becomes very small , the correlation function @xmath68 should correspond to spectrally broad light ( here @xmath69 is dirac delta - function ) . in the case of slow processes ,",
    "i.e. , in the case of adiabatic control of quantum states , the spectral interval @xmath64 may be of finite size .",
    "it is important to note that the frequency @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) denotes a measure of the frequency shift from the center @xmath71 of the light spectra .",
    "[ fig3 ]     in contrast , the envelope vector function @xmath72 has regular behavior and determines the light polarization . if one chooses the direction of light propagation as the @xmath73-axis ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the polarization ellipse lies in the @xmath74-plane .",
    "it is convenient to work with the polarization elements @xmath75 represented by spherical components @xmath76 @xcite of vector @xmath77 :    @xmath78    when @xmath75 are real , the polarization of light is such that the main semi - axes of the ellipse are oriented along the @xmath79 and @xmath80 axes .",
    "if @xmath75 are complex numbers , the difference between their phases determines the double rotation angle of the ellipse in the @xmath81-plane .",
    "the quantum states may be controlled through an appropriately chosen , time - dependent variation of the light polarization . as an example we consider the simple interaction scheme presented in fig .  4 : a single broad - band light beam excites a two - level system .",
    "the excited state ( @xmath82-state ) has the angular momentum @xmath83 and consists of one zeeman component @xmath84 .",
    "the ground state ( @xmath85-state ) posses angular momentum @xmath86 and therefore has three components , one of which @xmath87 is not involved in the interaction because of the chosen light polarization plane .",
    "the light s central frequency @xmath71 is assumed to be in resonance with the @xmath88 transition .",
    "the quantization axis is oriented along the _ z_-direction . as is apparent , the spherical component of light ( eq8 ) couples independently the transitions @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , the magnetic sublevels involved in this interaction effectively form a three - state @xmath0-scheme .    in our model",
    ", we assume that at @xmath90 only the @xmath91 component is populated .",
    "our aim is to analyze the efficiency of the stirap - like process that could transfer the population from @xmath91 to @xmath92",
    ". this population transfer can be accomplished by applying a sequence of light pulses with rabi frequencies @xmath93 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) by varying ( by changing light polarization ) the relative strength of the polarization components @xmath94 :    @xmath95    here @xmath96 denotes the atomic dipole moment . the rabi frequencies @xmath97 correspond to the strengths of the coupling interaction between the levels @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which is induced by the light s",
    "spherical components @xmath100 ( see fig .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 in the arguments of the exponential factors determines the interaction time , while the parameters @xmath101 give the temporal shifts of the applied impulses .",
    "it is worth emphasizing an important feature of the scheme presented here .",
    "clearly , each frequency @xmath70 of the light beam stimulates both transitions @xmath102 with effective partial rabi frequencies @xmath103 and results in the appearance of dark states ( eq2 ) . because the corresponding mixing angle @xmath104 turns out to be independent of @xmath70 , the photons prepare a unique dark state , which therefore is not coupled to the upper excited state @xmath99 .    here",
    ", however , new additional unwanted factors in the formation of the dark state arise .",
    "indeed , spectrally broad light actually consists of many uncorrelated photons with different frequencies @xmath105 . a photon with the fixed frequency @xmath105 that excites the transition @xmath106 ( the rabi frequency @xmath107 ) combines with a variety of photons of frequencies @xmath108 that excite the transition @xmath109 ( the rabi frequency @xmath110 ) .",
    "we could expect the presence of many nonzero two - photon resonance detunings @xmath111 to lead to strong mixing between the dark and bright states ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) ) , i.e. to a fast destruction of the dark state .",
    "however , there is one favorable circumstance : it is possible to distribute @xmath112-frequencies into pairs @xmath113 with opposite two - photon detuning values @xmath114 , so that the average value @xmath115 over the pair becomes zero . as a result",
    ", it may be possible to compensate the pair contribution in the mixing between dark and bright states .",
    "the total rate of unwanted population loss due to coupling to the @xmath3-state could be still reduced to zero despite the presence of many light frequencies . to verify this hypothesis",
    ", we need a robust treatment of the dynamics of the system .",
    "[ fig4 ]       the evolution of the system should be studied within the framework of the density matrix @xmath116 formalism . at first glance",
    ", the problem seems to be intractably complicated because of the presence of multi - chromatic light .",
    "fortunately , the broad spectrum of applied spectrally broad light results in an adiabatic elimination of the optical coherences @xcite in the optical bloch equations , i.e. , @xmath117 in our case . briefly , under the action of spectrally broad light , the effective lifetime @xmath118 of induced optical dipoles described by @xmath117 appears to be very short in comparison with the interaction time @xmath66 .",
    "the optical dipoles adiabatically follow only the @xmath119 , @xmath120 elements ( zeeman coherences ) . the diagram techniques for solving the evolution of the density matrix developed by konstantinov and perel @xcite and later by keldish @xcite justify the results that were first empirically obtained by claude cohen - tannoudji @xcite in the form of rate equations for the zeeman coherences @xmath121 under the broad - line approximation .",
    "a detailed study of various problems under broad - line approximation may be found in @xcite . in particular , the equations presented in @xcite and adopted for our system ( fig .",

    "the data exhibited in fig .  5 illustrate as well criterion ( [ eq19 ] ) of transfer adiabaticity : if we set a criterion for a successful population transfer at the level of @xmath195 equal to @xmath196 , the saturation starts in the region @xmath197 . if one wants to increase efficiency of population transfer ( increase value of @xmath193 ) further , one needs to increase @xmath198 .",
    "note that the simulation shows that a variation of the decay constant @xmath199 by up to an order of magnitude does not influence significantly the efficiency as a function of the pulse area @xmath198 and the delay @xmath200 between the pulses .",
    "it is of particular interest for practical applications to examine what happens when a weak magnetic field is present .",
    "the presence of zeeman splitting @xmath201 in system ( [ 10a])-([10d ] ) formally corresponds to two - photon detuning with value @xmath202 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the @xmath172-state ( [ eq14 ] ) fails to be a stationary solution of system ( [ 10a])-([10d ] ) , as the terms corresponding to @xmath201 mix the dark state with bright state , and some fraction of the @xmath2-state population flows to unwanted states : @xmath85-state @xmath203 and the initial state @xmath204 .",

    "6,7 the somewhat curious behavior of @xmath195 as a function of the light intensity in the region of large two - photon detuning values .",
    "initially when effective rabi frequencies @xmath208 or @xmath207 are small , the curves @xmath209 rise linearly with increasing @xmath150 in the sequence of simple observation : the population transfer occurs because the levels couple to the light , where larger @xmath150 corresponds to stronger coupling and , consequently , to larger transfer efficiency .",
    "this observation is true as long as the interaction of an atom with photons is linear , i.e. , light is unable to modify the bare states .",
    "when the light intensity starts to exceed the saturation value , the bare states are transformed into dressed states , each of which shares the population with the excited state ( if @xmath210 ) that clearly stimulates the unwanted population flow .",
    "moreover , the transformations are accomplished by energy shifts of the dressed states that lead to some effects with similarities to laser induced transparency . in the particular case of monochromatic stirap , because of the ac stark shift of the transition @xmath211 , the initial impulse @xmath212 ( see in appendix eq .",
    "( [ a7 ] ) ) results in increasing detunings from the transition @xmath106",
    ". both aforementioned factors dramatically decrease @xmath193 in the region @xmath213 as follows from figs  6,7 .",
    "the case of large @xmath150 values allows one to consider the problem under a perturbation approach in which the parameter @xmath214 becomes small .",
    "one of the dressed states has a structure close to that of a dark state ( see eq .",

    "in this paper we have demonstrated that if the states between which we carry out population adiabatic transfer ( stirap ) are degenerate , this process can be implemented with broad - band nonmonochromatic ( white ) light .",
    "the efficiency of the population transfer with broad - band radiation is similar to the efficiency of the stirap process that can be achieved in the traditional way with monochromatic radiation and , in the case of sufficiently slow , adiabatic manipulation of the states , can approach 100% .",
    "the existence of dark states in the manifold of magnetic sublevels of an atomic state created by the non - monocromatic radiation was noticed earlier ( see , for example , @xcite ) and was related to the well known phenomenon of optical pumping of atoms in the manifold of magnetic sublevels @xcite . in @xmath222s , a long time before the invention of lasers , the phenomenon of optical pumping was observed with a conventional spectrally broad light source by brossel , kastler , and winter @xcite and by hawkins and dicke haw53 . with this in mind",
    ", it should be easy to understand the conclusions of this paper , that with broad - band radiation it is possible not only to create a dark state in the manifold of magnetic sublevels , but it is possible also to manipulate this state .",
    "the demand that the states involved in the spectrally broad light stirap process are degenerate is essential .",
    "it ensures that the phase fluctuations of the radiation source are synchronous for the pump as well as the stokes field and cancels in the atom  light interaction process .",
    "even a weak magnetic field that splits magnetic sublevels on the order of the ground level - width destroys the dark state created by the broad - band radiation .",
    "it is obvious that the manipulation of coherent states created in the manifold of the magnetic sublevels by the broad - band radiation is not limited to the stirap process only , but can be extended to other coherent processes , such as coherent control of atomic states with three light fields in a tripod configuration @xcite or manipulation of many degenerate quantum states simultaneously @xcite .",
    "if one uses a broad - band radiation source with sufficient spectral density , population transfer through the continuum @xcite can be foreseen as well .",
    "the advantage of white light in is that it does not significantly perturb the continuum in contrast to the monochromatic lasers .",
    "the latter strongly modify continuum states and result in sharp fano profiles of dipole matrix elements @xcite that block the existence of stable dark states .",

    "b. shore and professor l. p. yatsenko for the useful discussions .",
    "it is of interest to analyze the population transfer scheme presented in fig .  4 for the case of two coherent lasers .",
    "we assume a large enough one - photon detuning value to ensure that the procedure of adiabatic elimination ( ae ) of the optical coherence elements @xcite will be valid .",
    "the same procedure is the main approach used in the broad - line approximation to obtain system ( [ 10a])-([10d ] ) for the dynamics of the density matrix driven with spectrally broad light .",
    "it is natural to expect some similarity between the coherent and incoherent cases and to take advantage of the well studied coherent case to predict important properties of the manipulation of states with broad - band radiation .",
    "we consider a three - level system , as depicted in fig .  4 , which is being excited by two independent coherent laser fields with rabi frequencies @xmath137 .",
    "in an experiment it would mean that one applies lasers with @xmath223 circular polarization to a two - level atom with angular momentum @xmath224 for the upper and lower energy states , respectively .",
    "the ground state zeeman sublevel @xmath203 is not involved in the interaction with the light .",
    "it collects the spontaneous population flow from the excited sublevel @xmath84 at the decay rate @xmath225 .",
    "the lasers have identical frequencies @xmath70 , i.e. , they are detuned from the @xmath226 bohr transition frequency @xmath227 at the same one - photon detuning @xmath228 .",
    "because of the possible presence of an external magnetic field , the zeeman sublevels @xmath98 may have zeeman energy shifts with value @xmath229 . clearly , the two - photon detuning @xmath189 is then equal to the corresponding zeeman splitting @xmath230 .",
    "if @xmath190 happens to be relatively large , for instance , if it effectively exceeds the inverse duration @xmath231 of the laser pulses ( we assume them to have gaussian shapes ( [ eq9 ] ) ) , the adiabatic approximation becomes valid for the density matrix elements @xmath232 ( the indices @xmath98 and @xmath99 belong to the ground and the excited states , respectively ) that make it possible to eliminate adiabatically @xmath233 @xcite .",
    "in addition , a large spontaneous decay rate @xmath234 ensures that adiabatic elimination is realized as well . under the rotating - wave approximation",
    "@xcite adiabatic elimination allows us to set @xmath235 and , thus , to reduce @xmath232 to the form stenholm , blushs , shore        the coherent matrix elements @xmath238 describe optical oscillators in an atom with decay constant @xmath239 .",
    "the oscillators are excited by the lasers radiation field , which have detunings @xmath240 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the excitation time @xmath241 is determined by the relation @xmath242 .",
    "if @xmath241 is substantially smaller than the characteristic duration @xmath66 of the laser pulses , i.e.      then the evolution of the amplitude @xmath232 follows the excitation adiabatically , and eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) comes to be valid .",

    "two new effective `` frequencies '' @xmath246 are introduced @xmath247which have dimension [ s@xmath248 and gaussian pulse shapes of the type ( 11b ) , which have arrived , as before , in an appropriate sequence .",
    "systems ( [ a10a])([a10d ] ) and ( [ 10a])([10d ] ) provide useful insight into how to apply knowledge of state control with two coherent fields to the case of state control with spectrally broad radiation . for instance , the reason for the existence of dark sates ( eq14 ) becomes clear , namely , when zeeman splitting is absent ( i.e. @xmath249 ) , systems ( [ a10a])([a10d ] ) and ( [ 10a])(10d ) become identical ( provided we identify the effective rabi frequencies @xmath136 and @xmath246 ) and the coherent dark state ( [ eq2 ] ) generates a spectrally broad light dark state in the form of ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "note that this situation corresponds to two - photon resonance when @xmath250 .",
    "it is clear as well that criterion ( [ eq5 ] ) for stirap adiabaticity is reduced to the requirement @xmath251 for the pulses @xmath252 ( [ a7 ] ) .",
