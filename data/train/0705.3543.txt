    "vesicles , which are closed membranes separating two regions filled up by generally different fluids , have very much in common with biological cells and have a number of applications in pharmaceutics .",
    "the truly non - equilibrium problem of describing the vesicle dynamics in external flows attracted lots of attention both from experimentalists @xcite and theoreticians @xcite . in experiments",
    "different regimes of vesicle dynamics were observed , usually in share flows . in the tank - treading regime",
    "a vesicle shape is stationary . in the tumbling regime",
    "a vesicle experiences periodic flipping in the shear plane .",
    "trembling , experimentally discovered in the work @xcite , is an intermediate regime between tank - treading and tumbling , in the regime a vesicle trembles around the flow direction .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite and @xcite have predicted similar vesicle behavior and called it vacillating - breathing and swinging respectively .",
    "the different types of the motion are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence ] .        in this paper",
    "we focus on constructing the phase diagram , which would predict what kind of regime corresponds to a given set of external parameters , such as vesicle non - sphericity , viscosity contrast , strength of external flow .",
    "although this problem was addressed previously by different authors , it is still far from being closed .",
    "as long as no analytic solution of this problem exists , theoretical studies were based either on numerical simulations or on some approximations allowing analytical treatment .",
    "numerical investigations of this problem involved several different computational schemes , including boundary element method @xcite , mesoscopic particle - based approximation @xcite , and an advected field approach @xcite .",
    "these approaches have shown qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "however , they did not solve the problem of constructing the vesicle phase diagram completely .",
    "analytical studies of the problem can be divided in two major classes . in the first one ,",
    "@xcite , phenomenological models of vesicle dynamics based on the classical work of keller and skallak @xcite were proposed and proved themselves to be rather efficient in explaining particular experiments .",
    "however , they can not cover wide range of parameters and can not , consequently , be used for constructing a phase diagram for the vesicle dynamics . in the second series of works , refs .",
    "@xcite , the studies are focused on nearly spherical ( quasi - spherical ) vesicles whose shape is close to spherical one and can be parameterized by an expansion over spherical harmonics .",
    "we propose a natural extension of the theory developed for quasi - spherical vesicles by accounting higher - order expansion terms .",
    "a perturbation scheme around the lamb solution for spherical body in an external flow @xcite allows one to derive the dynamic equations for the shape and the orientation of a vesicle and to investigate them analytically .",
    "we show that the high - order in the vesicle distortion terms produce a qualitative change in the phase diagram and make it significantly more complicated .",
    "the resulting diagram contains all three types of vesicle behavior which were observed experimentally . in our work , we analyze how the vesicle dynamics depends on different control parameters , such as viscosity contrast , vesicle excess area , internal membrane viscosity , strength of the flow , and ratio of the elongational and rotational components of the flow .",
    "we analyze also the vesicle orientation in the tank - treading regime .",
    "some of the results , derived in this paper were already reported in @xcite . here",
    "we present significantly more detailed derivations and analyze several aspects of the problem which were not discussed in @xcite .",
    "speaking about membranes we have in mind lipid bilayers , the simplest type of the biological membranes .",
    "physical properties of such objects have been extensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically ( see e.g. the books @xcite and the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "there are several features of the membranes which are important for our analysis .",
    "first , we assume that the membrane is in a fluid ( isotropic ) state ( is a @xmath0 liquid ) , which is typical of lipid bilayers under normal conditions .",
    "second , we assume that the vesicle has an excess area , that enables one to treat the membrane as incompressible .",
    "third , we assume that the membrane is impermeable to the surrounding fluids , the condition is usually well satisfied in experiment . finally ,",
    "we take into account the membrane internal viscosity , which can play an essential role , say , in the vicinity of the lipid - bilayer melting point @xcite .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : basic ]",
    "we expose basic theoretical facts concerning physics of membranes .",
    "a special attention is paid to dynamic properties of the membranes which can be treated as moving interfaces immersed in a @xmath1 fluid . in section [ sec : nearly ] we formulate peculiarities of nearly spherical vesicles , analyze their equilibrium properties , and derive phenomenological equation which describe their dynamics in weak external flows . in section [ sec : perturb ] we establish a dynamic equation for the vesicle evolution obtained in the framework of expansion over deviations from the ideal spherical shape .",
    "we introduce dimensionless parameters controlling the vesicle behavior . in section [ sec : planar ] we consider the case of planar external velocity field . in this case",
    "the dynamic equations can be essentially simplified enabling one to establish the phase diagram of the system containing domains corresponding to tank - treading , trembling and tumbling . in section [ sec : limit ] we analyze limit cases of weak and strong external flows where it is possible to study the vesicle behavior in details . in conclusion",
    "we discuss some outcomes of our work and its possible extensions .",
    "some technical details of the perturbation expansion are presented in appendix .",
    "we are interested in processes which take place at scales of the order of the vesicle size which are assumed to be much larger than the membrane thickness .",
    "this assumption is well justified for giant vesicles , usually examined in experiment . in the main approximation ,",
    "the membrane can be treated as infinitesimally thin , that is as a @xmath0 object ( film ) immersed into a @xmath1 fluid . in this case",
    "the vesicle is characterized by its geometrical shape . in other words , in this limit the vesicles can be considered as active interfaces separating different pieces of the fluid .    the two membrane properties , its incompressibility and impermeability , imply that both the vesicle volume @xmath2 and its surface area @xmath3 are conserved , provided the vesicle has an excess area .",
    "the latter can be characterized by a dimensionless factor @xmath4 , which is traditionally introduced as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a vesicle `` radius '' determined by its volume .",
    "the excess area factor is non - negative , @xmath7 , and the minimal value @xmath8 corresponds to the ideal spherical geometry .",
    "the nearly spherical ( quasi - spherical ) vesicles are characterized by the condition @xmath9 .",
    "the energy of the membrane is determined by its bending distortions and can be written as the following surface integral @xcite @xmath10 over the membrane position .",
    "here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are bending modules , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the mean and gaussian curvatures , respectively .",
    "they are related to the local curvature radii of the membrane @xmath15 and @xmath16 as @xmath17 in accordance with the gauss - bonnet theorem , the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ helfrich ] ) ( with the factor @xmath12 ) is invariant under smooth deformations of the membrane shape .",
    "therefore the term is irrelevant provided the vesicle topology is fixed .    besides the bending energy ( [ helfrich ] )",
    "the membrane is characterized by its surface tension @xmath18 .",
    "one should stress that for vesicles with excess area the surface tension is an auxiliary variable adjusting to other quantities characterizing the membrane and the surrounding flow to ensure the membrane incompressibility .",
    "in this paper we consider the situation where both fluids , outside and inside the vesicle , are newtonian .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the reynolds number associated with the vesicle dynamics is vanishingly small , which is the case in real experiments @xcite . under these assumptions",
    "the fluids can be described by the stokes equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is pressure , @xmath21 is the fluid velocity , @xmath22 is its mass density , and @xmath23 is its dynamic viscosity .",
    "the equation ( [ stokes ] ) has to be supplemented by the incompressibility condition @xmath24 , which leads to the laplace equation @xmath25 for the pressure .",
    "we divide the flow near the vesicle into two parts : an external flow , which would be observed in the fluid in the absence of the vesicle , and an induced flow , which is excited as a result of the vesicle reaction to the external flow .",
    "the external flow is assumed to be stationary , its velocity is designated as @xmath26 .",
    "one should remember that the vesicle is advected by the flow , and therefore the above assumption should be valid in the lagrangian reference frame attached to the vesicle .",
    "below , we neglect the term with the time derivative in eq .",
    "( [ stokes ] ) since the characteristic time scale associated with the vesicle dynamics is assumed to be large compared to the viscous relaxation time @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the characteristic spatial scale of the external flow is much larger than the vesicle size . in this case",
    "the external velocity @xmath26 near the vesicle can be approximated by a linear profile , determined by a derivative matrix @xmath28 .",
    "the incompressibility condition implies that the matrix @xmath28 is traceless .",
    "generally , the external flow has two contributions , elongational and rotational : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the strain matrix ( symmetric part of the matrix @xmath28 ) and @xmath31 is the angular velocity vector .",
    "the strain can be characterized by its strength @xmath32 , defined as @xmath33 .",
    "note that for a shear flow @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the shear rate .",
    "the fluids inside and outside the vesicle are assumed to be different .",
    "we use the designations @xmath23 for the external fluid viscosity , the viscosity of the internal fluid is designated as @xmath36 .",
    "an important parameter which controls the tank - treading to tumbling transition is the viscosity contrast @xmath37 .",
    "the limit where the viscosity contrast tends to infinity corresponds to a solid body behavior of the vesicle , that was concerned by jeffery @xcite .",
    "the membrane moves together with the fluid that is the velocity field @xmath21 is continuous on the membrane and the field @xmath21 determines the membrane velocity as well as the fluid velocity . for relatively slow processes , we are investigating , the membrane can be treated as locally incompressible , that leads to the condition @xmath38 to be satisfied on the membrane . here",
    "@xmath39 is the projector to the membrane , it can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unit vector normal to the membrane .",
    "the @xmath1 incompressibility condition @xmath42 together with eq .",
    "( [ sincomp ] ) leads to the relation @xmath43 , to be satisfied at both sides of the membrane .",
    "the membrane reaction is characterized by its surface stress tensor @xmath44 .",
    "there are three contributions to the tensor related to the bending energy ( [ helfrich ] ) , to the surface tension of the membrane , and to the internal membrane viscosity : @xmath45 where @xmath18 is the surface tension coefficient and @xmath46 is the membrane ( @xmath0 ) dynamic viscosity .",
    "note that the surface tension @xmath18 plays an auxiliary role being adjusted to other stresses to ensure the local membrane incompressibility .",
    "an expression for the bending contribution to the surface stress tensor was found in the work @xcite ( see also the book @xcite ) .",
    "it can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the membrane mean curvature and @xmath49 is defined by eq . ( [ sincomp ] ) .",
    "the surface force @xmath50 ( force per unit area ) associated with the membrane stress tensor @xmath51 can be calculated as @xmath52 .",
    "then one obtains from the expressions ( [ me4],[kap ] ) three contributions to the surface force @xmath53 where @xmath54 l_i \\ , ,   \\label{hforce } \\\\",

    "second , one should use the kinematic relation ( [ kinema ] ) .",
    "this procedure results in a closed non - linear equation for @xmath70 .",
    "note that due to the property ( [ decompos ] ) the expression is a sum of two terms , which are proportional to the external flow gradient ( [ graddec ] ) and to the bending modulus @xmath11 .",
    "of course , both terms are non - linear in @xmath70 .",

    "the dimensionless displacement @xmath70 is small and it is possible to develop an expansion over @xmath70 .",
    "this perturbation series is a basis for subsequent consideration .",
    "it is natural to represent the function @xmath71 as a sum over spherical harmonics : @xmath76 the homogeneous contribution to @xmath70 ( its zero angular harmonic @xmath77 ) can be expressed via the inhomogeneous one ( non - zero harmonics ) from the relation ( [ constraint ] ) which reflects the volume conservation . substituting the obtained expression for the zero angular harmonic into eq .",
    "( [ constrainta ] ) we obtain an expression for @xmath4 whose expansion over @xmath70 starts from the second order term .",
    "therefore the displacement @xmath70 can be estimated as @xmath78 .",
    "that justifies the expansion over @xmath70 .",
    "different angular harmonics in @xmath70 play different roles .",
    "the zero harmonic @xmath77 can be excluded from the beginning , as we explained .",
    "first order harmonics @xmath79 , describe a shift of the vesicle without changing its shape , and therefore do not play any important role in the vesicle dynamics . the most essential role is played by the second angular harmonic which determines mainly the vesicle shape ( at small @xmath4 ) . as to higher harmonics , they relax fast in comparison with the relatively slow dynamics of the second harmonic . therefore , the higher harmonics also do not play an essential role in the vesicle dynamics . to avoid a misunderstanding ,",
    "let us stress that the last assertion is valid for stationary external flows . as it was discovered experimentally @xcite and",
    "explained theoretically @xcite , at some conditions ( abrupt inversion of the external purely elongational flow ) high angular harmonics are generated , the phenomenon is called wrinkling .",
    "the vesicle shape depends on the strength of the external flow . in weak",
    "flows it is close to an equilibrium one whereas in strong flows it is determined by the velocity gradient matrix ( [ graddec ] ) . in this section",
    "we consider the first case .",
    "we discuss the equilibrium vesicle shape and then develop phenomenology for the vesicle dynamics in weak flows .      in the absence of the external flow ,",
    "an equilibrium shape of the vesicle can be found by minimization of an effective free energy @xmath80 where the first term is determined by the expression ( [ helfrich ] ) and @xmath81 is the membrane excess area expressed in terms of the displacement @xmath70 .",
    "the lagrange multiplier @xmath82 , related to a fixed value of the membrane area , coincides with the equilibrium value of the surface tension .",
    "the second lagrange multiplier ( related to the volume @xmath2 ) is absent in eq .",
    "( [ free_energy ] ) since we imply that the zero angular harmonic in an expansion of the displacement @xmath70 is expressed via other ones from the relation ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "therefore , the volume conservation is automatically satisfied in our scheme .    if @xmath4 is small , the principal contributions to the energy ( [ helfrich ] ) as well as to the excess area are of the second order in @xmath70 .",
    "it is convenient to write the contributions in terms of the coefficients @xmath83 of the expansion ( [ harmonics ] ) of @xmath71 over the angular harmonics : @xmath84 note , that the first angular harmonic ( with @xmath85 ) is absent in the expansions .",
    "the reason is that it corresponds to a vesicle shift as a whole , which does not change the energy and the area of the vesicle . as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ secondf ] ) , the free energy is minimal if only the second angular harmonic is excited . in this case",
    "@xmath86 , which is an equilibrium value of the surface tension .",
    "note that the second order term ( [ secondf ] ) is degenerate in @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the vesicle equilibrium shape , one should take into account terms of higher order in the expansion of the effective free energy ( [ free_energy ] ) , which violate the degeneracy . in the main approximation , it is possible to keep third order in @xmath70 terms , and a contribution to @xmath70 related to the second angular harmonics .",
    "for a subsequent analysis , it is convenient for us to use the following real basis @xmath88 instead of the traditional angular functions @xmath89 .",
    "the functions @xmath90 are normalized as @xmath91 in terms of the functions ( [ basispsi ] ) , the contribution to @xmath70 related to the second angular harmonic , can be rewritten as follows @xmath92 where @xmath93 are some real coefficients .",
    "expanding the bending energy ( [ helfrich ] ) and the excess area @xmath4 upto the third order in @xmath70 and substituting there the expansion ( [ psiexp ] ) one obtains @xmath94 where summation over repeated indices is implied and we designated @xmath95 components of the object @xmath96 are of order unity , they can be found from the definition ( [ xi ] ) after substituting the expressions ( [ basispsi ] ) .    minimizing the free energy ( [ third ] ) over @xmath97 and determining the lagrangian multiplier @xmath82 from the condition @xmath98 , one obtains @xmath99 this is the correction related to the third order term in the expansion of the free energy .",
    "the minimum of the energy corresponds to a prolate uniaxial ellipsoid .",
    "if the principal axis of the ellipsoid is directed along the @xmath100-axis its shape is determined by the expression @xmath101 , that is @xmath102    substituting the expression ( [ exactst ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ third ] ) we find that the coefficient before @xmath103 term in the effective free energy is estimated as @xmath104 .",
    "it contains an extra small factor @xmath78 in comparison with the natural estimation @xmath11 .",
    "thus , both , second order and third order , terms in the free energy ( [ third ] ) are of the same order .",
    "that gives a formal justification of taking the third order term into account despite the smallness of @xmath70 .",
    "here , we analyze the case of weak external flows that can not significantly distort the vesicle equilibrium shape .",
    "as we established in the preceding subsection , the equilibrium shape of a nearly spherical vesicle is the prolate ellipsoid possessing the uniaxial symmetry .",
    "an orientation of such ellipsoid in space can be characterized by a unit vector @xmath105 directed along the principal axis of the ellipsoid .",

    "it is convenient to utilize the following parametrization of the unit vector @xmath105 @xmath118 the components here are written in the cartesian reference frame attached to the flow : the @xmath119-axis is directed along the velocity and the @xmath100-axis is directed opposite to the angular velocity vector @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : shear_flow ] for clarification ) . substituting the expression ( [ director ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dot_n ] ) and taking into account that the shear velocity gradient matrix has the only non - zero component @xmath120 one obtains @xmath121 note that the dynamics of the angle @xmath122 is separated .",
    "the equations ( [ t - tt],[eqvarth ] ) resemble equations for a single polymer dynamics examined in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the equations ( [ t - tt],[eqvarth ] ) lead to either tank - treading or tumbling regimes of vesicle motion .",
    "for @xmath123 the tank - treading regime is realized , with a steady tilt angle ( between the vector @xmath105 and the velocity direction ) @xmath124 otherwise , for @xmath125 , the tumbling regime takes place : the vector @xmath105 experiences a time - periodic motion with an average rotation in the shear plane .",
    "thus , @xmath126 corresponds to the tank - treading to tumbling transition . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ t - tt ] ) , the transition is realized via the saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "here , we start to carry out the program ( formulated in subsection [ subsec : parametr ] ) leading to a dynamic equation for the dimensionless displacement @xmath70 .",
    "the program can be realized for nearly spherical vesicles by using a generalization of the lamb scheme . in accordance with lamb @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a solution of the stationary stokes equation can be explicitly expressed via the velocity field taken at a sphere both for the internal and external problems .",
    "the lamb scheme can be directly applied to a spherical solid body immersed into a fluid or to a spherical cavity filled up by a fluid . then the velocity field is expressed in terms of its surface value .",
    "for a nearly spherical vesicle the scheme has to be slightly modified .",
    "namely , one should express the velocity field via its value on the sphere of the radius @xmath6 .",
    "the values can be obtained by an analytical continuation of the internal and of the external velocity fields and are slightly different for the internal and for the external problems .",

    ", one can ascribe the membrane velocity directly to the sphere @xmath127 ignoring deviations of the vesicle shape from the sphere . keeping then the lowest in @xmath70 terms in all expressions one passes to an equation for the displacement @xmath70 equivalent to the one discussed in refs .",

    "if small in @xmath70 corrections to the truncated equation ( [ truncated ] ) will be taken into account then the system of limit cycles , characteristic of this equation at @xmath336 , will survive with small perturbations .",
    "next , if the term @xmath66 in the expression ( [ decompos ] ) is neglected all the limit cycles will be neutral ( they are no stable , no unstable ) .",
    "indeed , the cycle passing through a point @xmath367 can not be stable , since then due to the symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) it should remain stable after the time inversion .",
    "thus , the corrections to the truncated equation ( [ truncated ] ) keep its main property which is an existence of an additional integral of motion ( leading to the neutrality of the limit cycles ) .",
    "thus only the term @xmath66 proportional to @xmath11 can destroy the integrability corresponding to the neutral limit cycles .",
    "it produces a selection leading to stable limit cycles or to stable stationary points .",
    "since the selection is produced among limit cycles slightly disturbed in comparison with the ones corresponding to the truncated equation ( [ truncated ] ) , the results will be the same in the main approximation in @xmath4 .",
    "thus the above results obtained for strong flows can be immediately extended to the extremely strong flows , where @xmath368 .",
    "we have investigated dynamics of nearly spherical vesicles in an external stationary flow , being mainly focused on the shear flow . the general calculational scheme developed for nearly spherical vesicles enabled us to analyze the dynamics in detail .",
    "the scheme is based on solving the @xmath1 hydrodynamic ( stokes ) equations with boundary conditions posed on the membrane .",
    "besides the membrane bending elasticity we have taken into account the internal membrane viscosity , leading to an additional dissipation mechanism .",
    "there are essentially different regimes of the vesicle dynamics dependent on a relation between the strain of the external flow and the vesicle relaxation rate . in the weak",
    "flows the vesicle shape is close to an equilibrium one which is a prolate ellipsoid .",
    "then a role of the external flow is reduced mainly to an orientation of the ellipsoid . in the strong",
    "flows the vesicle shape and orientation are determined by the flow .",
    "we established the vesicle behavior for different strengthes of the external flow including its orientation relative to the external velocity .",
    "the most interesting phenomenon in the vesicle dynamics is transition to tumbling regime which occurs at increasing the generalized viscous contrast ( [ defa ] ) or at increasing the rotational component of the external flow .",
    "we demonstrated that in weak flows a direct transition from tank - treading to tumbling occurs whereas in strong flows an intermediate regime , trembling , is realized .",

    "the situation can not be improved by introducing higher order terms related to the external flow . and only after introducing higher order terms related to the membrane bending elasticity into the equation it enables one to find , say , boundaries of the region where the trembling regime is realized .    the transitions tank - treading to tumbling and tank - treading to trembling have essentially different scenarios .",
    "the first transition is described as a saddle - node bifurcation whereas the second one is described as a hopf bifurcation .",
    "our theory predicts existence of a special point on the diagram where the two above transition lines merge .",
    "one expects an essential `` critical '' slowness of the vesicle dynamics near the point .",
