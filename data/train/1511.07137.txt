    "ammonium azide ( aa ) has been attracting considerable interest as a precursor for synthesis of polymeric nitrogen due to its high nitrogen content of 93.3@xmath8 by weight and also the fact that it gives out environment friendly decomposition products.@xcite it also exhibits extensive hydrogen bonding between ammonium cation and terminal nitrogen atoms of azide anions.@xcite unlike the alkali , alkaline - earth and transition metal azides which are either ionic or covalent,@xcite aa is found to have mixed bonding with unique properties .",
    "it has got much attention recently as a gas generator due to its weak explosive characteristics.@xcite using kamlet - jacobs equations , the calculated detonation properties , namely , detonation velocity and pressure are found be 6.45 km / s and 15.16 gpa , respectively.@xcite aa is used to inflate safety cushions in auto - mobiles with a suitable oxidizer and also used as a solid rocket propellant in photochemical micro - rockets for altitude control.@xcite in order to address its potential applications , one has to understand the crystal structure and physical properties at the microscopic level .",
    "several experimental studies have been reported in the literature exploring fundamental properties at ambient conditions .",
    "frevel@xcite first reported the crystal structure of aa which was re - determined later using single crystal@xcite and powder@xcite x - ray diffraction .",
    "the infra - red ( ir ) vibrational spectra were reported@xcite , which was followed by a combined ir and raman study.@xcite it was further refined and extended by iqbal et al@xcite who analyzed the vibrational modes of azide ion and the low frequency lattice modes using far - ir and raman spectroscopic techniques at ambient pressure and low temperatures .",
    "from theoretical perspective , the structural , mechanical , electronic and optical properties of aa were reported at ambient pressure from first principles calculations at 0 k.@xcite    since inorganic azides undergo a series of phase transitions involving lattice distortions coupled with changes in the orientation of the linear azide anions thereby forming polymeric nitrogen networks under pressure , high pressure study of these materials has become an active field of research during the last decade.@xcite synthesis of polymeric nitrogen from molecular nitrogen ( n@xmath9n is the strongest bond , 954 kj / mol ) has been achieved@xcite and it consists of individual nitrogen atoms connected by single bonded ( n - n ) networks .",
    "it is the best green high energetic density material ( hedm ) known till date.@xcite the azides consist of linear - rod - shaped n@xmath10 ions with quasi double bonds ( n = n bond is weaker than n@xmath9n , 418 kj / mol ) .",
    "hence , it can be expected that the ( n = n = n)@xmath11 ions of metal azides may form polymeric nitrogen networks more readily than molecular nitrogen ( n@xmath9n).@xcite among the inorganic azides , aa is quite interesting due to modification in the strength of hydrogen bonding under compression .",

    "they proposed a new tetragonal phase ( hns-2 ) with crystal symmetry @xmath13 .",
    "the order of stability of the four phases at ambient pressure is as follows : aa @xmath14 ttz @xmath14 hns-2 @xmath14 hns-1 and they also encounter a series of phase transitions from aa @xmath15 hns-2 at 5.6 gpa , hns-2 @xmath15 aa at 15 gpa , aa @xmath15 ttz at 30 gpa and ttz @xmath15 hns-1 at 69.2 gpa .",
    "recently these transitions are revisited for aa , ttz , hns-1 phases and reported@xcite that the transitions found to occur between aa @xmath15 ttz at 41.4 gpa and ttz @xmath15 hns-1 at 89.4 gpa , respectively using dft - d2 method .",
    "there is an inconsistency between theoretical calculations in predicting the phase transition pressures using various dispersion corrected approaches and also dependence of temperature on phase stability of n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds is unknown . with this motivation ,",
    "we have investigated relative phase stability of n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds , structure and lattice dynamics of aa at ambient as well as at high pressure using dispersion corrected density functional calculations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly describe the methodology of computation .",
    "results and discussion concerning phase stability of hydro - nitrogen solids as well as structural and lattice dynamics of aa under high pressure are presented in section iii .",
    "finally section iv summarizes the conclusions of the paper .",
    "thermodynamic stability was investigated by comparing free energy of the investigated hydro - nitrogen solids . in order to predict the thermodynamic ground state of n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds , we have calculated gibbs free energy of the four investigated compounds .",

    "the free - atom reference values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are taken from the self - interaction corrected time dependent(td)-dft calculations of chu and dalgarno.@xcite they take advantage of the relationship between the effective volume and polarizability to calculate dispersion coefficients that depend on the chemical environment of the atom .",

    "is compared to the density of the free - reference atom to obtain a scaling factor which is used to define the response of the dispersion coefficients to chemical environment .",
    "however , the vdw - ts scheme does not include long range electrostatic screening beyond the range of the exponentially decaying atomic densities.@xcite recently tkatchenko et al@xcite proposed a computationally efficient method ( ts - scs ) extension to the vdw - ts method , in which they considered electrodynamic response effects , in particular , the interactions of the atoms with the dynamic electric field due to the surrounding polarizable atoms and also account for many - body effects based on the coupled fluctuating dipole model . in this method ,",

    "at ambient conditions , aa crystallizes in the orthorhombic structure with space group @xmath47.@xcite it possesses distorted cscl - type structure because of strong hydrogen bonding between nh@xmath48 and n@xmath10 ions and the arrangement of azide ion is similar to that in the ambient structures of heavy metal ( ag , tl ) azides . due to presence of the hydrogen bonding",
    "one half of the azide anions lie parallel to a - axis ( type - i ) and the other half lie perpendicular to a - axis ( type - ii ) as depicted in figure [ fig : aa ] by allowing a tetrahedral arrangement around a single ammonium cation.@xcite ttz is a molecular crystal , which consists of non - linear arrangement of four n - atoms in a chain with two hydrogen atoms each attached to both ends of the n@xmath0 molecule and four such molecules are arranged with @xmath49 symmetry in the unit cell.@xcite hns-1 contains similar molecular structure as ttz with a hydrogen atom attached to each nitrogen atom in each ( nh)@xmath50 unit and the two units are separated by a distance within the unit cell of @xmath12 symmetry.@xcite recently a new tetragonal phase has been predicted with @xmath13 symmetry,@xcite where two ( nh)@xmath0 units form a distorted cyclic octagon within the unit cell , in which each nitrogen atom is attached to one hydrogen atom .",
    "the crystal structures of the four n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds are shown in figure [ fig : nh ] and all these phases are molecular crystalline solids .",

    "the non - covalent weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding and dispersive interactions play a significant role in determining the stability of these molecular solids .",
    "it is well known that the standard dft functionals are inadequate to predict the long range interactions in molecular crystalline solids .",
    "consequently , semi - empirical dispersion correction methods have been developed and implemented through the standard dft functionals to provide an accurate description of long range weak interactions . in our previous study@xcite , we have investigated the structural and elastic properties of aa at ambient pressure using the dispersion corrected dft - d2 and vdw - ts methods along with standard dft functionals . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", we also show that the vdw - ts method is successful in predicting the ground state properties of aa over dft - d2 method.@xcite hence we have used the dispersion corrected vdw - ts and ts - scs methods for all the calculations in the present study . as a first step , we have performed full structural optimization including lattice geometry and fractional coordinates of the four n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds .",
    "the calculated unit cell parameters for these compounds are consistent with the available experimental data@xcite and other theoretical calculations@xcite which are presented in table [ tab : lp ] .    from our first principles calculations",
    ", we found that total energies of the n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds increase in the following order ; e@xmath51 @xmath52 e@xmath53 @xmath52 e@xmath54 @xmath52 e@xmath55 at ambient pressure .",
    "the total energy of the aa is lowered by 0.15 , 0.36 , 0.38 ev / atom when compared to ttz , hns-2 , and hns-1 , respectively and the order of stability is consistent with the previous calculations.@xcite this clearly shows that aa is the relatively stable phase among the studied n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds at ambient pressure .",
    "what happens to the order of stability at higher pressures for these four phases@xmath56 we made an attempt to investigate the phase transitions and the possibility for the formation of hydro - nitro solid under high pressure .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : pt_p ] , we predict a series of phase transitions aa @xmath15 ttz at 39.3 gpa , ttz @xmath15 hns-1 at 79.8 gpa using ncpp approach , which are in good agreement with recent theoretical calculations@xcite using dispersion corrected dft - d2 method . also the transition pressures obtained using ultra - soft pseudo - potential ( uspp ) approach are found to be aa @xmath15 ttz at 27.5 gpa , ttz @xmath15 hns-1 at 74.2 gpa ( see figure 1 of the supplementary material ) and are comparable with the ones obtained in the study by liu et al.@xcite the inconsistency between transition pressures of the examined compounds are due to difference in the pseudo - potentials used in the calculations .",
    "recent raman spectroscopic measurements reveal that the hns-1 will be formed at even much higher pressures ( @xmath14 71 gpa ) and hence the transition pressures obtained using ncpp including dispersive interactions are in good agreement with the experimental observations.@xcite medvedev et al@xcite determined the pressure at which polymorphic structural phase transition from phase i to ii occurs at around 3 gpa and phase ii consists of nh@xmath0 and n@xmath5 ions similar to phase i with a difference that both of the azide groups must occupy equivalent crystallographic positions to be consistent with observations from raman spectroscopy .",
    "this is further confirmed by the single crystal x - ray diffraction study and the phase ii is temporarily assigned as tetragonal phase.@xcite recently liu et al@xcite predicted the crystal structure of the tetragonal phase with @xmath13 symmetry and it possesses a distorted cyclic structure which is in contrast to the structure proposed by the raman spectroscopic measurements.@xcite in addition , they also find structural transitions from aa @xmath15 hns-2 at 5.6 gpa and hns-2 @xmath15 aa at 15 gpa . in order to resolve the above issues we systematically investigated the high pressure behavior of aa and hns-2 phases and we found that aa does not undergo a transition to hns-2 phase below 20 gpa ( see figure 2 of the supplementary material ) .",
    "therefore the prediction / determination of crystal structure of phase ii is still an open challenge for both theoreticians and experimentalists .",
    "in addition , we also considered the contribution of lattice vibration at elevated pressure and temperatures .",
    "since aa decomposes at 673 k ( 400 @xmath57c)@xcite , we have plotted gibbs free energy as a function of pressure ( 0 - 100 gpa ) and temperature ( 0 - 650 k ) within vdw - ts method . as illustrated in figure [ fig : pt_pt ] ,",
    "aa undergoes a structural transition to ttz around 39.3 gpa at 0 k ( see figure [ fig : pt_p ] ) and the transition pressure increases to 42.6 gpa with increasing temperature up to 650 k. further , ttz transforms to hns-1 around 79.8 gpa at 0 k ( see figure [ fig : pt_p ] ) and the transition pressure increases from 79.8 to 89.7 gpa when the temperature raises from 0 to 650 k. overall , we observe that aa is the thermodynamic ground state of n@xmath0h@xmath0 * compounds * which is consistent with the previous theoretical calculations@xcite and also aa transforms to ttz around @xmath1 39 - 43 gpa followed by transformation of ttz to hns-1 around @xmath1 80 - 90 gpa under the studied temperature range 0 - 650 k.      we have also studied the structural properties of the thermodynamic ground state ( aa ) of n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds under pressure up to 0 - 2.5 gpa , 0 - 20 gpa and 20 - 50 gpa in steps of 0.25 , 2 and 5 gpa , respectively .",
    "the pressure dependent unit cell parameters obtained using vdw - ts method are in good accordance with the experimental data@xcite within 0 - 2.5 gpa with an exception for lattice parameter c , which shows a larger contraction due to over binding within the studied pressure range ( see figure [ fig : lattice]a ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : lattice]b , we observe that there is a strong anisotropy between the lattice constants @xmath2 , @xmath58 and @xmath3 in the low pressure region ( 0 - 3 gpa ) . the lattice constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 approach towards each other because of accelerated and decelerated compression of @xmath2 and @xmath3 lattice constants respectively and they merge between 18 - 22 gpa .",
    "this is due to rotation of type - ii azide ions and reduction in the hydrogen bond energy,@xcite consequently the anisotropic phase i undergoes transition to phase ii under compression .",
    "this will be further confirmed by lattice dynamical calculations under pressure in the up coming section .",
    "raman spectroscopic studies suggest that phase ii is stable up to 55 gpa@xcite .",
    "however , based on our present calculations we predict that phase ii further transforms to a less anisotropic low symmetry structure around 22 gpa .",
    "in addition , we have also compared the calculated normalized lattice parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath58 , @xmath3 , and @xmath59 ) at ambient pressure ( 0 gpa ) with the experimental data ( 0.07 gpa is experimental ambient pressure).@xcite the calculated relative compressibilities of unit cell axes are presented in figure [ fig : lattice]c along with the experimental results.@xcite the reduction of @xmath58 lattice parameter is larger under compression which is clearly seen from the study of the first order pressure coefficients @xmath60x@xmath61 = @xmath62 ( @xmath63 = @xmath2 , @xmath58 , @xmath3 ) . the calculated first order pressure coefficients ( in gpa@xmath64 ) using vdw - ts scheme are found to be 8.9 @xmath42 10@xmath65 , 20.4 @xmath42 10@xmath65 , and 6.6 @xmath42 10@xmath65 for lattice parameters @xmath2 , @xmath58 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this clearly shows that @xmath58-axis is the most compressible due to flattening of the wave - like planes of n@xmath10 anions under compression which further reveals that aa is sensitive to impact along the @xmath58-axis .",
    "crystallographic @xmath3-axis is the least compressible because of type - ii azide anions align parallel to @xmath3-axis with increasing pressure as shown in figure [ fig : lattice]c , resulting in an excellent agreement with the experimental observation@xcite as well as with our recent theoretical prediction from the longitudinal elastic constants.@xcite the calculated ordering of the elastic constants ( c@xmath66 @xmath67 c@xmath68 @xmath67 c@xmath69 ) further confirm that @xmath58-axis is the most and @xmath3-axis is the least compressible axes for aa.@xcite as illustrated in figure [ fig : lattice]d , the calculated pressure - volume ( p - v ) data is consistent with the experiments@xcite especially in the low pressure region .",
    "this might be due to fact that the dispersion coefficients c@xmath31 used for the chemical species n and h are kept constant over the studied pressure range .",
    "overall , the experimental trends are well reproduced by the vdw - ts method up to 2.5 gpa .",
    "we also calculated equilibrium bulk modulus ( @xmath70 ) and it is found to be 27.6 gpa by fitting pressure - volume data to 2@xmath71 order birch - murnaghan equation of state.@xcite the obtained @xmath70 value of 27.6 gpa is slightly higher when compared to the experimental values of 24.5@xcite , 20.2@xcite , and 19.8@xcite gpa and it is consistent with our previously calculated value of 26.34 gpa using uspp.@xcite the @xmath70 of aa lies between the @xmath70 values of alkali metal azides ( ama ) and heavy metal azides ( hma ) indicating that aa is relatively harder than ama and softer than hma .    the elastic behavior of a crystalline solid is described by its matrix of second - order elastic constants , which is given in the voight notation by the expression @xmath72 where v is the equilibrium volume , @xmath73 denotes the strain and e is total energy of the crystal which is given by @xmath74 where e@xmath24 is the energy of the unstrained perfect crystal . the elastic constants matrix is a real symmetric matrix of size 6@xmath426,@xcite and hence it can have at most 21 independent matrix elements .",
    "these 21 matrix elements are indeed independent of each other in a crystal with least symmetry .",
    "thus there are 21 independent elastic constants for crystals with triclinic bravais lattice .",
    "the number of independent elastic constants become smaller as the symmetry of the crystal increases .",
    "there are only three independent elastic constants for crystals with cubic symmetry .",
    "it turns out that there are 9 independent elastic constants for crystals with orthorhombic structure , which are c@xmath68 , c@xmath69 , c@xmath66 , c@xmath75 , c@xmath76 , c@xmath77 , c@xmath78 , c@xmath79 , and c@xmath80 .",
    "further , the nine elastic constants are classified into three categories such as ( i ) longitudinal ( c@xmath68 , c@xmath69 , c@xmath66 ) , ( ii ) shear ( c@xmath75 , c@xmath76 , c@xmath77 ) and ( iii ) transverse coupling ( c@xmath78 , c@xmath79 , c@xmath80 ) elastic constants .",

    "insight on structural phase transition in aa , we have also calculated the elastic constants at ambient as well as at high pressure up to 20 gpa .",
    "the calculated elastic constants at ambient pressure are consistent with our previous@xcite and other@xcite theoretical calculations .",
    "a crystalline lattice is mechanically stable at zero pressure only if the born stability criteria@xcite are fulfilled . in case of orthorhombic systems",
    "the stability criteria are@xcite @xmath84 the obtained elastic constants satisfy the born stability criteria indicating that aa is mechanically stable at ambient pressure .",
    "when a non - zero uniform stress is applied to the crystal , the above criteria to describe the stability limits of the crystal at finite strain are not adequate and the born stability criteria must be modified.@xcite sinko and smirnov reported the theoretical conditions of elasticity under pressure@xcite and the modified elastic constants for a orthorhombic crystal under pressure are c@xmath85 = c@xmath85-p , ( for @xmath86 = 1 - 6 ) , c@xmath78 = c@xmath78+p , c@xmath79 = c@xmath79+p and c@xmath80 = c@xmath80+p .",
    "hence new stability criteria are obtained by replacing the elastic constants in eqn ( 8) by the modified elastic constants .",
    "therefore , aa is mechanically stable under hydrostatic pressure when the generalized born stability criteria are : @xmath87 are simultaneously satisfied . as depicted in figure [ fig : elastic]a , the calculated elastic constants show a non - monotonic variation with pressure .",
    "the pressure dependent elastic constants obey the generalized born stability criteria as given in eqn ( 9 ) except m5 and it is plotted as a function of pressure along with m6 .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : elastic]b , m6 decreases up to 5 gpa and later it increases up to 16 gpa and then starts decreasing with pressure , which indicates that the applied pressure drives shear instability in the system up to 5 gpa and then stabilizing above 5 gpa .",
    "also m5 violates the stability criteria between 18 - 20 gpa , which clearly indicates the mechanical instability of aa under high pressure .",
    "softening of the shear elastic moduli m5 and m6 suggests a shear instability of aa under pressure .",
    "karki et al@xcite reported that elastic instability bounds the transition pressure and determines the transition pressure precisely for first and second order phase transitions , respectively .",
    "mechanical stability criteria , m6 and m5 bounds the transition pressure for aa and hence one can expect that the phase transition in aa is of first order type .      as discussed in section i , raman spectroscopic measurements on aa@xcite revealed that it undergoes a polymorphic structural phase transition about 3.0 gpa due to weakening of the hydrogen bonding under pressure .",
    "they also proposed two possible reasons for weakening of hydrogen bonding@xcite which are 1 ) elongation of",
    "n ... n distance due to the rotation of azide ( n@xmath10 ) ion , which leads to increment of the n - h bond length .",
    "2 ) reorientation of nh@xmath48 ions leading to bending of n - h ...",
    "n bond.@xcite a recent experimental study @xcite on aa shows that n - h ... n bond decreases with pressure and the weakening of hydrogen bonding is only because of the bending of n - h ... n bond , which is possibly due to movement of ammonia cation and rotation of azide ( type - ii ) ions . in order to confirm this , we made an attempt to investigate the high pressure behavior of intermolecular hydrogen bonds .",
    "the angle made by type - ii azides with c - axis ( see figure [ fig : aa ] ) , @xmath88 angle @xmath89 , is plotted in the pressure range 0 - 2.5 gpa .",
    "as seen from figure [ fig : beta]a , the angle @xmath89 decreases with pressure , which is consistent with the experimental data@xcite whereas the neutron powder diffraction data shows a much rapid decrease of the angle in the pressure range of 0 - 2.5 gpa.@xcite further we investigated the angle @xmath89 beyond 2.5 gpa and observe a rapid decrease below 12 gpa , it reaches a minimum value at 12 gpa and then it starts increasing with pressure up to 50 gpa as shown in figure [ fig : beta]b which is due to re - orientation of type - ii azide ions with respect to c - axis under compression . the calculated hydrogen bond lengths ( n(5) ... n(2 ) and n(5) ... n(4 ) ) and the corresponding bond angles ( n(5)-h(1) ... n(2 ) and n(5)-h(2) ... n(4 ) ) under pressure are shown in figure 4 of the supplementary material .",
    "the calculated n(5) ... n(2 ) and n(5) ...",
    "n(4 ) bond lengths decrease with pressure and are in good agreement with the experimental data up to 2.5 gpa.@xcite the reorientation of nh@xmath48 ions leads to bending of n - h ... n hydrogen bond and this can be analyzed by calculating the intermolecular hydrogen bond angles of n - h ... n bonds under compression .",
    "the calculated hydrogen bond angles show a significant variation ( @xmath1176 - 178 ) between 4 - 10 gpa and the n(5)-h(2) ...",
    "n(4 ) reaches a maximum value at 10 gpa due to orientation of type - ii azide ions as shown in figure [ fig : ba_h ] .",
    "ir and raman spectroscopic techniques have been used for the identification and characterization of energetic materials.@xcite the vibrational properties of a molecular solid provide information about the intra- and inter - molecular bonding .",

    "the mode m32 is purely from the rotation of both nh@xmath48 and n@xmath10 ions , whereas m31 and m30 arise from translation motion of nh@xmath48 ion , which agrees well with the observed@xcite raman mode value of 240 cm@xmath64 .",

    "joseph et al@xcite made an unified explanation for strengthening of hydrogen bonding ( x - h ...",
    "y ) based on red / blue shift of ir frequency and its corresponding intensity .",
    "the contraction of hydrogen donor bond ( x - h ) due to electron affinity of x atom and the associated blue shift and decrease of intensity in ir spectrum or elongation of hydrogen donor bond ( x - h ) due to attraction between the positive h and electron rich y atom . as shown in figures [ fig : ir]d @xmath100 f , the n - h scissoring , rocking and stretching mode frequencies show a red shift and an increase in the intensity of the corresponding vibrational modes up to 4 gpa , which clearly indicates strengthening of the hydrogen bonding under compression below 4.0 gpa . also the n - h stretching frequencies show a blue - shift between 5 - 12 gpa which shows weakening of the hydrogen bonding as shown in figure [ fig : ir]g . as displayed in figure [ fig : ir]f @xmath100 g , two n - h asymmetric stretching b@xmath4 ( 2988.6 cm@xmath64 ) and b@xmath7 ( 2989.2 cm@xmath64 ) degenerate modes lift the degeneracy whereas the b@xmath6 ( 3012.4 cm@xmath64 ) and b@xmath7 ( 3015.1 cm@xmath64 ) non - degenerate modes become degenerate under pressure .",
    "this is due to strong and weak coupling between n - h band of nh@xmath0 and terminal nitrogens of type - i and ii azide ions which strengthens and weakens the hydrogen bonding , respectively in the pressure range 0 - 4 gpa .",
    "in addition , we also observe the intensity of asymmetric n - h stretching mode b@xmath4 ( 3001.2 cm@xmath64 ) decreases with pressure and it diminishes between 3 - 4 gpa .",
    "weakening of hydrogen bonding and disappearance of b@xmath4 mode might be the driving force for the structural transition from phase i @xmath15 ii as seen in the experiments.@xcite      in order to get more insight on the dynamical stability of crystalline aa under high pressure , the phonon dispersion curves are calculated at 0 and 6 gpa with 1 @xmath42 2 @xmath42 1 super cell ( 64 atoms ) .",
    "the computed phonon dispersion curves are plotted along z - t - y - s - x and u - r high symmetry directions of the brillouin zone .",
    "as depicted in figure [ fig : disp_1 ] , all the lattice modes ( @xmath52 700 cm @xmath64 ) shift towards high frequency region except a phonon branch that shows softening ( from 38.8 to 35.5 cm@xmath64 ) along the high symmetry s - x - direction when compared at 0 and 6 gpa pressures ( see figures [ fig : disp_1]a @xmath100 b ) .",
    "it is also found that the lattice phonon branches become dispersive at 6 gpa .",
    "however , the phonon frequencies are still real along x - direction at 6 gpa which shows the dynamical stability of aa at this pressure . the degenerate n@xmath5 bands around @xmath1 620 cm@xmath64 at 0 gpa become non - degenerate modes at 6 gpa ( see figures [ fig : disp_1 ] c @xmath100 d ) .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : disp_2]a , the lowest lying raman bands correspond to symmetric stretching of type - i @xmath100 ii azide ions at 0 gpa which persist even at high pressure 6 gpa , but the raman measurements@xcite have only one stretching band in this region above 3 gpa which is due to the fact that the two azides occupy equivalent wyckoff positions in the high pressure phase ( see [ fig : disp_2]a @xmath100 b ) .",
    "the present and recent theoretical calculations@xcite are unsuccessful in reproducing the raman spectral evolution under high pressure as observed in the experiments.@xcite the middle and top phonon bands correspond to n - h bending modes which show a red shift when compared at 0 and 6 gpa pressures as displayed in figures [ fig : disp_2]a @xmath100 b. the n = n = n asymmetric phonon bands show a blue - shift with pressure as depicted in figures [ fig : disp_2]c @xmath100 d. the high frequency n - h symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands show a red shift as presented in figures [ fig : disp_2]e @xmath100 f. however , the high frequency modes show a red shift up to 4 gpa and later on they exhibit blue - shift as shown in figure [ fig : ir]g .",
    "we also observe that there is a deviation in the calculated phonon frequencies using nc ( see figures [ fig : raman ] and [ fig : ir ] ) and paw ( see figures [ fig : disp_1 ] and [ fig : disp_2 ] ) pseudo potentials , especially for n = n = n symmetric and asymmetric stretching phonon modes .",
    "overall , we observe that all the vibrational modes are real for the ambient phase ( i ) of aa at 0 and 6 gpa .",
    "this implies that aa is found to be dynamically stable at ambient as well as at high pressure ( 6 gpa ) as depicted in figures [ fig : disp_1 ] and [ fig : disp_2 ] and also suggest that the structural transition might be due to the weakening of the hydrogen bonding under high pressure .",
    "in summary , we made a detailed study of phase stability , structural and vibrational properties of aa under hydrostatic compression up to 50 gpa with dispersion correction methods .",
    "the calculated ground state parameters at ambient as well as at high pressure using vdw - ts and ts - scs methods are in good agreement with experimental data and this study shows the importance of semi - empirical dispersion correction methods to capture dispersive interactions in molecular solids .",
    "the calculated compression curves are consistent with the trend followed by the elastic constants as well as with high pressure experimental data .",
    "softening of the shear elastic moduli is suggestive of mechanical instability of aa under high pressure .",
    "aa is found to be the thermodynamic ground state of n@xmath0h@xmath0 compounds and it undergoes a series of phase transitions from aa @xmath15 ttz at around @xmath1 39 - 43 gpa and ttz @xmath15 hns-1 at 80 - 90 gpa under the studied temperature range of 0 - 650 k which are consistent with the recent theoretical calculations .",
    "the anisotropic compressibility of a and c lattice constants suggests that the ambient phase of aa undergoes a transition to tetragonal phase , and then to a less anisotropic low symmetry crystalline phase above 22 gpa .",
    "we predict a rapid decrease in the angle that type - ii azides make with c - axis ( @xmath89 ) till 12 gpa and then an increase up on further compression .",
    "in addition to that we have also calculated the zone centre phonon frequencies , ir spectra using dfpt at ambient and under high pressure .",
    "the calculated vibrational frequencies at ambient pressure and their complete vibrational assignment are consistent with experimental observations .",
    "aa is found to be dynamically stable at ambient pressure and no soft phonon mode is observed beyond the experimental transition pressure from phonon dispersion curves . also the calculated ir spectra show that the n - h stretching frequencies get a red and blue - shift below and above 4 gpa , respectively .",
    "the intensity of the b@xmath4 mode is found to diminish gradually and the weak coupling between nh@xmath0 and n@xmath5 ions makes b@xmath6 and b@xmath7 modes to be degenerate with progression of pressure up to 4 gpa which causes weakening of hydrogen bonding and these effects lead to a structural phase transition in aa around 4 gpa and this is in good agreement with the experimental observations .",
