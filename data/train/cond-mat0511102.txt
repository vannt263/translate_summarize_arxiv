    "these comparisons were restricted to the glass order parameters , the nonergodicity parameters .",
    "going beyond that , even time dependent quantities , like the intermediate scattering function , have been compared with each other for the binary lennard - jones liquid @xcite , binary mixtures of hard spheres @xcite and the polydisperse quasi - hard - sphere system @xcite , again demonstrating consistency with mct .",
    "glassy dynamics of systems with self - generated disorder is not restricted to liquids .",
    "molecular crystals in their plastic phase exhibit glassy behavior as well . this has been found experimentally three decades ago @xcite .",
    "recently two of the present authors have extended mct to molecular crystals @xcite . using the static structure factors from percus - yevick theory @xcite the orientational glass transition of uniaxial hard ellipsoids on a simple cubic lattice",
    "has been investigated @xcite .",
    "there it has been found that this transition is not driven by an orientational cage effect , analogous to supercooled liquids , but by the growth of orientational order .",
    "this growth manifests itself in an increase of the _ static _ orientational correlators at the brillouin center or edge , which in turn leads to an increase of the memory kernel .",
    "however , before the corresponding orientational correlation length diverges at the corresponding equilibrium phase transition line , the nonlinear feedback mechanism of mct results in an orientational glass transition .",
    "the same mechanism has been identified for a liquid of uniaxial hard ellipsoids @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the mct glass transition line is located within the orientationally disordered ergodic phase @xcite and not in the supercooled regime .",
    "one may ask whether there also exists a cage - effect - driven glass transition for molecular crystals .",
    "good candidates are plastic crystals which undergo a first order equilibrium phase transition to an orientationally ordered phase .",
    "several such systems exist such as cyanoadamantane , ethanol , cyclooctanol , difluorotetrachloroethane or @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "another one is chloroadamantane , which exhibits an equilibrium phase transition at @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "have demonstrated consistency with mct predictions @xcite .",
    "these predictions can really be extended from liquids to plastic crystals because the mct equations for the latter have the same mathematical structure than for multi - component simple liquids @xcite .",
    "it is the main goal of the present paper to perform a first principle comparison between the results for chloroadamantane from a md - simulation and mct .",
    "the outline of our contribution is as follows . in the second section",
    "we will describe the model , introduce the orientational correlation functions , give some details of the simulational procedure and shortly describe the relevant mct equations .",
    "results are presented and discussed in the third section and the final section contains a summary and some conclusions .",
    "chloroadamantane @xmath19 is a rather huge molecule which belongs to the substituted adamantane family .",
    "it shows a plastic phase structure isomorphous to cyanoadamantane , but the chloroadamantane molecule possesses a smaller substitute and a faster dynamics well adapted for md simulation investigations .",
    "chloroadamantane undergoes at @xmath20 a first order transition from an ordered monoclinic structure to a rotator phase with face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) symmetry @xcite .",

    ".parameters for the two - site chloroadamantane model . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the simulated system is composed of rigid linear molecules with two sites : one chlorine atom ( noted cl ) and one super atom ( noted adm ) that models the adamantane part @xmath22 .",
    "the moment of inertia is 302.733 @xmath23 .",
    "molecular dynamics calculations were performed on a system of @xmath24 molecules ( @xmath25 fcc crystalline cells ) interacting through a lennard - jones short range site - site potential of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance between two different sites .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are specified in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the chloroadamantane molecule possesses a relatively large dipolar moment @xmath32 ( 2.39 debyes ) which is parallel to the molecular axis .",
    "the electrostatic interactions were handled by the ewald method with two partial charges ( @xmath33 ) localized on both sites .",
    "newton s equations of motion were solved with a time step of @xmath34 fs .",
    "we worked in the npt ( constant number of molecules , temperature and pressure ) and nvt ( constant number of molecules , temperature and volume ) statistical ensembles with periodic boundaries conditions .",
    "the sample was first equilibrated in the npt ensemble",
    ". then , md runs at constant volume using the average volume determined from the npt simulations were performed .    since our molecule - model has one rotational symmetry axis we can use the angles @xmath35 to characterize the orientation of the n - th molecule at site @xmath36 and time @xmath37 .",

    "it is represented in figure  [ fig1 ] , which also contains the experimental result @xcite .",
    "it is the shrinking of the lattice constant ( cf .",

    "on the other hand , mct provides an equation of motion for @xmath0 which requires the static correlators @xmath54 as an input .",
    "because of the crystal s anisotropy , these correlators also depend on the direction of @xmath44 . therefore the numerical solution of the t - dependent mct equations",

    "first , we have fitted the md - results by the von schweidler law in order to determine the critical nonergodicity parameters @xmath134 from the correlators at the lowest simulated temperature @xmath135 , which is close to @xmath136 . on the other hand",

    "however , @xmath144 from mct is _ not _ close to one and deviates from the md - result by about @xmath16 per cent .",

    "similar conclusions can be drawn for @xmath146 ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) and @xmath147 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "there are two features which are reproduced by mct . _",
    "first _ , we observe that the mct - result for @xmath148 ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) and @xmath149 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) is practically zero , in semi - quantitative agreement with the corresponding md - result .",
    "this is even true for all @xmath44 . _",
    "second _ , the hierarchy @xmath150 and @xmath151 is valid for both mct and md .",
    "the main motivation of the present paper has been the test of the validity of the mct predictions for the glassy behavior of molecular crystals .",
    "mct has been recently extended from liquids to molecular crystals @xcite .",
    "since the corresponding equations of motion have the same structure as for multicomponent simple liquids , the mct predictions for the liquid systems also hold for molecular crystals .    in order to check the validity of these predictions we have performed a md simulation for a simple model of chloroadamantane . in contrast to earlier simulations @xcite",
    ", we have used a _",
    "rigid _ fcc - lattice , however , with an appropriately chosen temperature - dependent lattice constant @xmath53 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath53 with decreasing temperature enhances the steric hindrance , which is responsible for the glassy dynamics .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] clearly demonstrates the validity of this physical picture .",
    "there are two kinds of tests . on",
    "the one hand one can check the validity of the two scaling laws predicted by mct @xcite . without attempting to calculate the corresponding exponents from first principles this represents an important qualitative test . on the other hand",
    "a first principle comparison can be made between the md- and mct - results , as has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite . concerning the test of the scaling laws we have restricted ourselves to the second scaling law which holds for the @xmath12-relaxation regime . in this regime ,",
    "mct for liquids and molecular crystals predicts the @xmath95 superposition principle which implies a data - collapse under rescaling time by the @xmath12-relaxation time @xmath85 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] clearly demonstrates the validity of the second scaling law over a large temperature range for e.g.  the collective and `` self '' correlators with @xmath152 .",
    "increasing @xmath153 and @xmath154 leads to a shrinking of that temperature range and also of the interval of validity for @xmath84 ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the t - dependence of @xmath85 is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] . as predicted by mct a power law dependence",
    "is found with a glass transition temperature @xmath155 .",
    "close to @xmath136 deviations from the power law exist , due to ergodicity restoring processes .",
    "the value @xmath136 is about @xmath156 per cent below @xmath137 , consistent with what has been found for liquids @xcite .",
    "the md - results have shown a very high sensitivity of the relaxational behavior on @xmath117 .",
    "for instance the collective correlators for @xmath146 and @xmath157 exhibit a two - step relaxation process with a plateau very close to one , but a very peculiar behavior for @xmath158 ( see fig.[fig7]a ) .",
    "for the latter there is practically no plateau .",
    "the same holds for @xmath147 and @xmath159 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig7]b ) . a first principle comparison between the md- and mct - results ( see figs .",
    "[ fig8]-[fig10 ] ) reproduces this unusual m - dependence .",
    "we stress that this unusually low plateau value is _ not _ related to a small corresponding static correlator .",
    "however , the critical nonergodicity parameters for @xmath160 , @xmath161 and for @xmath147 , @xmath162 from mct deviate by about @xmath16 per cent from the numerical ones .",
    "this strong discrepancy can have several reasons .",
    "first , the truncation at @xmath163 may lead to a significant underestimation of the critical nonergodicity parameters .",
    "second , there may be quite a different reason we want to explain now .",
    "the potential energy of the rigid molecular crystal can be written as follows : @xmath164 in case of two - body interactions .",
    "the isotropic part @xmath165 is not essential . besides the pair interactions given by @xmath166",
    "there is a one - particle term @xmath167 , which is a kind of crystal field , due to the crystal s anisotropy .",
    "@xmath168 will have a finite number of local minima .",
    "if the pair interaction @xmath166 would be zero , the molecules at finite temperatures would perform thermally activated jumps between these local minima , as can be really seen in figure 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite . starting in one of the local minima it is obvious that the long time limit of , e.g. the `` self '' correlators , will be positive .",
    "this happens for all initial conditions with energy below the corresponding energy barrier , and has already been investigated for a @xmath169-model @xcite .",
    "this type of cage effect generated by an anisotropic one - particle potential is _ not _ accounted for by mct which describes a two- , three- , etc .",
    "particle - cage - effect in a self consistent way .",
    "we believe that the large numerical values for the critical nonergodicity parameters are mainly due to such a one - particle - cage - effect .",
    "let us finally comment on the role of phonons , which are absent in the present md - simulation , and also in mct for molecular crystals @xcite .",
    "a comparison of , e.g. @xmath136 and @xmath170 from the present simulation with earlier ones for the same model for chloroadamantane but on a non - rigid lattice shows that phonons do not have a noticeable influence on these quantities and on the long time dynamics .",
    "two of the authors ( f. a. and m. d. ) wish to acknowledge the use of the facilities of the idris ( orsay , france ) and the cri ( villeneuve dascq , france ) where calculations were carried out .",
