    "a key aim in spintronics is the realization of spin - based quantum information devices , where coherent electron spin manipulation is a fundamental issue.@xcite in semiconductor quantum dots , coherent electron spin manipulation can be realized by electron spin resonance ( esr ) , where an oscillating magnetic field is applied to the sample in order to rotate the electron spin.@xcite together with esr , electron dipole spin resonance techniques  which combine ac electric fields with spin - orbit interaction@xcite or with a dc magnetic field gradient@xcite  have been implemented in order to measure coherent rotations of one single electron spin@xcite in double quantum dots ( dqds ) .",
    "coherent spin rotations of one single spin have also been proposed theoretically in triple quantum dots ( tqds)@xcite under crossed ac and dc magnetic fields .    in esr experiments in quantum dot arrays ,",
    "an important issue is to individually address the electron spin in each quantum dot . to this end",
    ", it has been proposed to tune the zeeman splitting , in order to manipulate the electron spin independently in each dot.@xcite the zeeman splitting in a quantum dot is determined by the intensity of the applied dc magnetic field and the electron g factor , @xmath0 .",
    "hence different zeeman splittings can occur in quantum dot arrays where the dots have different g factors , or as well by applying different magnetic fields to each quantum dot .",
    "both alternatives have been realized experimentally very recently : vertical dqds made out of different materials  e.g. gaas and ingaas  show different g factors@xcite and on the other hand , in a sample with a spatially homogeneous g factor , an additional micro - ferromagnet placed nearby creates a different external magnetic field @xmath1 in each dot.@xcite    the next logic step from dqds to networks of quantum dots is a tqd , in linear or triangular arrangement .",
    "both versions have been realized experimentally in the last few years,@xcite where tunneling spectroscopy and stability diagram measurements have been performed in order to gain a deeper insight into the electronic configurations in tqds , which is necessary for potential three - spin qubit applications . on the theoretical side , next to fundamental studies of their eigenenergy spectrum,@xcite tqds",
    "have attracted interest mostly in a triangular arrangement , where the system symmetry gives rise to fundamental coherence phenomena . in this context , so - called `` dark states''@xcite and aharonov - bohm oscillations@xcite have been studied .",

    "we calculate the current and current spin polarization through a dqd and a linear tqd array exposed to crossed dc and ac magnetic fields .",
    "we consider an inhomogeneous dc magnetic field that produces different zeeman splittings in the dots , while the g factor is the same in both dots .",

    ", interdot tunneling is governed by definite spin selection rules , i.e. tunneling from one dot to the other is only possible when two equal spin levels are aligned . however ,",
    "when an ac magnetic field is applied , it rotates the spin and allows for spin - flip processes along the tunneling that can lead to new features in the current .",
    "this effect of an ac magnetic field has been explored previously in a dqd,@xcite where the authors report single electron spin rotations by a combination of an ac magnetic field and sharp electric pulses .    in our work , as will be discussed in more detail below , we will focus our attention on the polarizing effect of an ac field , i.e. we will show that the combination of inhomogeneous dc and ac magnetic fields in dqds and tqds allows for the creation of spin - polarized currents and thus for the design of spin - filters and spin - inverters .",

    "we restrict the discussion for simplicity to the case where the zeeman splittings are @xmath152 , although this condition is not necessary , as long as @xmath161 .    from the previous sections we already know that depending on the detuning , the dot connected to the drain can act as @xmath63- or @xmath64-filter . in a tqd ,",
    "there is one more degree of freedom compared to the dqd regarding the `` detuning '' between the dot levels . without loss of generality",
    ", we can fix the energy level of dot 1 , and move the energy levels of dot 2 and 3 ( which is experimentally realized by applying gate voltages to the corresponding dots ) . under these conditions , there are then four relevant energy level configurations , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ tqdinverter ] , lower panel . in two of the configurations ( i and ii )",
    ", the tqd acts as a _ spin - polarizer _ , and in the other two ( iii and iv ) the electron spin is _",
    "inverted_. we hereby arrive at another important result of our work : a tqd can be tuned as both spin - polarizer and spin - inverter , by confining one electron in the left dot and adjusting the gate voltages at two of the three dots .",
    "then electrons coming from the left lead can only enter with a distinct spin - polarization , which depends on the level position of the central dot .",
    "as the magnetic field @xmath162 is turned on with frequency @xmath125 , the electron spin coming from dot 1 is rotated in dot 2 , whereas dot 1 and dot 3 due to their different zeeman splittings are far off resonance from the ac field .",
    "dot 3 then acts as spin - filter and , depending on the relative position of its energy levels with respect to dot 2 , a @xmath66- or @xmath67-polarized current is produced , similar as in the dqd described in the previous sections .",
    "we plot the total @xmath163 and spin - resolved currents @xmath97 and @xmath98 versus the two gate voltages applied to dot 2 and dot 3 in fig .",
    "[ tqdinverter ] , together with sketches of the corresponding energy level distribution . in situations",
    "i and iv , dot 2 is energetically in resonance with the @xmath63-level in dot 1 .",
    "therefore , only @xmath63-electrons coming from the left lead will be able to tunnel to dot 2 . here",
    "they are inverted due to @xmath125 , where the renormalized energy levels have been depicted schematically as we did for the dqd .",
    "it depends then on the level position of dot 3 , if the outgoing current is spin - up ( case i ) or spin - down ( case iv ) polarized .",
    "an analogue situation occurs for cases ii and iii : the energy level of dot 2 is such that only @xmath64-electrons can tunnel from dot 1 to dot 2 .",
    "again , after rotation due to the ac field in dot 2 , in dot 3 the spin is filtered without inversion ( case ii ) or inverted ( case iii ) .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed spin current polarization in the transport through a dqd with one extra electron , and through a tqd with two extra electrons in the system .",
    "the quantum dot arrays are subjected to two different external magnetic fields : an inhomogeneous dc field , which produces different zeeman splittings in the dot , and a time dependent ac field , that rotates the electron spin in one dot , when the resonance condition @xmath164 is fulfilled . for the dqd",
    ", we have analyzed both off - resonance and resonance conditions of the ac field with either one of the zeeman splittings .",
    "our results show that ac magnetic fields produce strongly spin - polarized current through a dqd depending on the detuning of the energy levels in the dots and on the resonance conditions .",
    "finally , we have proposed a tqd in series as both @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "as in a dqd , in a tqd different zeeman splittings in the sample combined with a resonant ac frequency give way to spin - polarized currents .",
    "in addition , spin - polarized incoming current can be achieved , and thus the spin - polarizing mechanism can be extended to a spin - inversion mechanism .",
    "our results show that dc and ac magnetic fields combined with gate voltages allow one to manipulate the current spin - polarization through dqds and tqds which are then able to work as a spin - filter and spin - inverter .",
    "in spintronic devices at the nanometer scale an environment of nuclei introduces additional spin - flip processes that can lower the efficiency of the desired mechanism . in our set - up",
    ", we do not expect spin - flip processes due to hyperfine interaction to influence drastically on the results , because hyperfine spin - flip times are usually much longer than typical tunneling times in quantum dot arrays , especially in finite magnetic fields , where the hyperfine interaction is an inelastic process .    therefore , the systems presented in this work are promising candidates for spintronic devices .",
