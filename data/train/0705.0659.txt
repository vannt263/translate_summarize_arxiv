    "this dimension depends of course on the degree and multiplicities of the general divisor of @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we show that in fact this number is completely determined by the values of the intersections @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where the @xmath10 s are the strict transforms of lines through pair of the @xmath1 points and @xmath11 is the strict transform of @xmath5 .",
    "this work is an attempt to generalize the results of  @xcite to the three dimensional case by extending the techniques used in  @xcite .",
    "recently , in  @xcite and  @xcite , an higher dimensional analog of the same problem is studied under the more restrictive hypothesis that all the points lie on a rational normal curve of @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that this assumption implies the finite generation of the cox ring of the blow - up variety , while in the case analyzed by the present paper this statement is false .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ notation ] we fix the necessary notation while section  [ prel ] focuses on preliminary results regarding the intersection theory of the varieties which are needed throughout the paper .",
    "the main algorithm is explained in section  [ algorithm ] , here we show how starting from the linear system @xmath13 , associated to @xmath3 , one can find a fixed - component free linear system @xmath14 of the same dimension of @xmath13 . then we proceed to define three different types of systems , listed in conclusion  [ concl 3 types ] , which cover the range of all the possibilities .",

    "if @xmath350 , then we can consider an exact sequence like before ( using @xmath351 in stead of @xmath352 if @xmath337 ) , and , using arguments as before , we can reduce to proving the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups of @xmath353 ( or @xmath354 if @xmath355 ) . obviously ,",
    "this procedure can be repeated untill we are reduced to proving the vanishing of the higher cohomology groups for a class @xmath356 satisfying conditions ( 1)-(4 ) , and with either @xmath357 or @xmath358 and @xmath338 .",
    "note that @xmath359 and @xmath304 occurring in @xmath320 are in fact the same as the original ones .",
    "we thus end the proof with the following :    [ d = m1 ] assume that @xmath360 satisfies conditions ( 1)-(4 ) with @xmath361 , then @xmath362 for all @xmath363 .",
    "this can be regarded as the `` toric case '' by putting the three points @xmath364 in @xmath365 and observing that @xmath0 and @xmath48 are toric varieties .",
    "the evaluation of the dimension of @xmath208 can be worked out by counting the monomials with multiplicities @xmath21 at these points . in the same way the cohomology groups of @xmath208 and @xmath320 can be found by purely combinatorial methods and in particular we have that @xmath334 for all @xmath325 .    by hypothesis",
    "we have that @xmath366 for @xmath367 .",
    "now let @xmath368 for @xmath369 so that @xmath370 with @xmath371 and denote this class by @xmath372 .",
    "we will now prove by induction on @xmath222 that for any @xmath363 @xmath373 for all @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "an easy calculation , using lemma s  [ c1,c2 ] and [ int y_i ] , shows that @xmath376 .",
    "moreover , @xmath377 because the degree @xmath378 is less than the biggest multiplicity @xmath379 . in this way",
    "it is enough to prove the vanishing of the first and second cohomology group .    if @xmath380 , then @xmath381 is the system @xmath382 so that @xmath383 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? *",
    "iii , theorem 5.1 ( b ) , p. 225 ) ) .",
    "now assume @xmath384 and @xmath385 , so that @xmath386 . note that , because @xmath384 , we do not blow up lines , so we work on @xmath387 .",

    "consider the exact sequence @xmath329 & { { \\mathcal a}}_{b-1 } - f_b \\ar[r ] & { { \\mathcal a}}_{b-1 } \\ar[r ] & { { \\mathcal a}}_{b-1 } \\otimes { { \\mathcal o}}_{f_b } \\ar[r ] & 0 . } \\ ] ] recall that , since @xmath398 , the restriction of @xmath399 to @xmath400 is given by : @xmath401 a standard argument shows that @xmath402 for all @xmath363 and this , together with the vanishing of @xmath403 ( by induction ) implies that @xmath404 for @xmath363 .",
    "but @xmath405    again we will use induction , now on @xmath406 , so we assume that the statement is true for all @xmath407 .",
    "let @xmath408 and consider the exact sequences @xmath329 & { { \\mathcal a}}'_{b } - e_b \\ar[r ] & { { \\mathcal a}}'_{b } \\ar[r ] & { { \\mathcal a}}'_{b } \\otimes { { \\mathcal o}}_{e_b } \\ar[r ] & 0 } \\ ] ] and @xmath409 & { { \\mathcal a}}'_{b } - e_b - f_b \\ar[r ] & { { \\mathcal a}}'_{b } - e_b \\ar[r ] &           ( { { \\mathcal a}}'_{b } - e_b ) \\otimes { { \\mathcal o}}_{f_b } \\ar[r ] & 0 . } \\ ] ] since @xmath410 , we have that @xmath411 for @xmath363 .",
    "so , because of our induction hypothesis , the cohomology of the first exact sequence implies @xmath412 for @xmath413 . on the other hand @xmath414 , and one",
    "easily checks that @xmath415 for @xmath363 .",
    "so , from the cohomology of the second exact sequence and the fact that @xmath416 we conclude that @xmath417 for @xmath363 .",
    "as seen before , the dimension of @xmath418 is equal to the dimension of @xmath419 and this number is evaluated in the following .",
    "[ 2m , m^r ] let @xmath300 then @xmath420 .",
    "the virtual dimension of the system @xmath421 is equal to @xmath422 only if @xmath423 .",
    "this means that for bigger values of @xmath1 the system is special .",
    "the statement is trivial for @xmath424 , so assume @xmath422 to be positive .",
    "because of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.2 ( 2 ) ) , we know that the base locus of the linear system @xmath421 on @xmath425 , is @xmath426 .",
    "this implies that @xmath427 for all @xmath300 ( because all the @xmath31 s lie on @xmath11 ) . and according to ( * ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) , we then obtain the statement .",
    "let us just note that the techniques used throughout this paper can yield an alternative prove of theorem  [ 2m , m^r ] .",
    "more precisely , we can consider the blowing up @xmath428 of @xmath0 along @xmath11 , and the linear system @xmath429 on @xmath428 . using induction on @xmath422 and cohomology of the exact sequence @xmath329 & \\tilde{{{\\mathcal l}}}_y - { { \\mathcal s}}_r \\ar[r ] &   \\tilde{{{\\mathcal l}}}_y \\ar[r ] &           \\tilde{{{\\mathcal l}}}_y \\otimes { { \\mathcal o}}_{\\tilde{q } } \\ar[r ] & 0 , } \\ ] ] with @xmath430 , one can obtain that @xmath431 . and ,",
    "since obviously @xmath432 , this proves the theorem .",
    "we recall that @xmath315 , for @xmath433 is equal to the opposite of the intersection of the strict transform of @xmath10 with @xmath208 ( if this intersection is negative ) .",
    "the same is true for @xmath314 , where the line is @xmath50 through @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "finally , the number @xmath434 can be described as @xmath435        note that , since @xmath208 is standard and @xmath215 we have that @xmath1 is at least @xmath442 . from the assumptions , it follows that @xmath443 .",
    "define @xmath304 to be the set of @xmath174 such that @xmath359 is positive and consider the system @xmath444 defined on @xmath62 of the form : @xmath445 since @xmath446 belongs to the base locus of @xmath208 , we have that @xmath447 .",
    "the linear system @xmath444 thus satisfies the following conditions      on the other hand , using lemma s  [ c1,c2 ] and [ int y_i ] , an easy but tedious calculation shows that @xmath449 so , in order to prove theorem  [ t>0,a ] , it is sufficient to show that for any @xmath325 @xmath450    denote by @xmath451 and consider a general element @xmath328 from which we have the exact sequence @xmath329 & \\tilde{{{\\mathcal l}}}_y - { { \\mathcal s}}_r \\ar[r ] & \\tilde{{{\\mathcal l}}}_y \\ar[r ]       & \\tilde{{{\\mathcal l}}}_y \\otimes { { \\mathcal o}}_{\\tilde{q } } \\ar[r ] & 0 . } \\ ] ]    by abuse of notation , let @xmath11 also denote the anticanonical curve on @xmath452 , then @xmath453 .",
    "so , since @xmath59 and @xmath56 are disjoint , we have that the restriction of @xmath444 to @xmath59 is : @xmath454 observe that this system is standard because @xmath455 and @xmath456 . on the other hand",
    ", condition  ( 4 ) implies that @xmath457 .",
    "so it follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) that @xmath458 for any @xmath325 .    in order to obtain",
