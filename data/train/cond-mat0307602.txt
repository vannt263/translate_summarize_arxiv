    "the experimental data in these figures were taken with he i radiation ( 21.2 ev ) at a sample temperature of 60 k on a clean surface obtained by _ in situ _ cleavage of a single crystal .",
    "instrumental energy and momentum resolution amounted to 70 mev and 0.07 @xmath367 , respectively .",
    "we note that the low - energy spectral properties of ttf - tcnq involve inter - chain hopping and electron - phonon interactions .",
    "thus , the 1d hubbard model pdt results are to be applied above the energies of these processes .",
    "the singular branch lines studied in sec .",
    "iii correspond to the @xmath0-plane region which contains all one - electron removal spectral - weight singular features . in spite of the recent improvements in the resolution of photoemission experiments @xcite , it is difficult to measure the exponents and the finest details of the electronic structure experimentally , in part due to the extrinsic losses that occur on very anisotropic conducting solids @xcite .",
    "thus , a crucial test for the suitability of the model ( [ h ] ) to describe real quasi-1d materials is whether the arpes peak dispersions correspond to the singular branch lines and other divergent spectral features predicted by the pdt of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the electronic density of tcnq is @xmath368 . for densities in the domain @xmath45 and one - electron removal , the main singular spectral features predicted by the general pdt are of branch line type .",
    "thus , for tcnq the main divergent spectral features correspond to the singular branch lines studied in sec .",
    "the only other singular feature is quite weak and corresponds to the lowest line of fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the vicinity of such border line",
    "the spectral - weight distribution corresponds to the power - law dependence ( [ b - border ] ) , which is controlled by a @xmath181 independent exponent . due to its weakness",
    "such a border line does not lead to any preeminent tcnq spectral feature .    while the theoretical weight - distribution branch - line expressions provided in sec .",
    "iii refer to all values of @xmath181 and @xmath263 , a detailed study of the spectral - function @xmath34 , @xmath179 , and @xmath181 dependence in the vicinity of the branch lines obtained in this paper confirms the validity of the preliminary predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite : the electron removal spectra calculated for @xmath369 ev , @xmath370 ev ( @xmath371 ) , and @xmath266 yields an almost perfect agreement with the three tcnq experimental dispersions .",
    "the exception is the low - energy behavior , as a result of the inter - chain hopping and electron - phonon interactions , as mentioned above .",
    "if accounted for a renormalization of the transfer integral due to a possible surface relaxation @xcite , these values are in good agreement with estimates from other experiments @xcite .    the experimental tcnq finite - energy peak dispersions of fig .",
    "@xcite correspond to the spin @xmath229 branch line ( [ sline ] ) and charge @xmath372 and @xmath373 branch lines ( [ ciline ] ) of fig . 1 of that reference . those are the main finite - weight singular branch lines in the one - electron removal spectral function for @xmath371 and @xmath266 .",
    "importantly , only these main singular features , whose line shape is controlled by negative exponents , lead to tcnq peak dispersions in the real experiment .",
    "the exponent ( [ zetas ] ) corresponds to the spin @xmath229 branch line and is plotted in fig . 1 for @xmath268 .",
    "the exponents ( [ zetaci ] ) that correspond to the charge @xmath374 branch line and charge @xmath373 branch line are plotted in figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "as reported in sec .",
    "iii , for finite values of @xmath181 the value of the constant @xmath375 of the spectral - function expression ( [ bci ] ) strongly decreases for momentum values such that @xmath331 .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of tcnq experimental spectral features for momentum values @xmath376 @xmath367 in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , along the corresponding @xmath373 branch line of fig . 1 of that reference .",
    "thus , our detailed branch - line pdt analysis fully agrees with the preliminary theoretical results of refs . @xcite for the tcnq problem . on the other hand , the theoretical predictions for the ttf dispersions presented in ref",
    "@xcite are very preliminary . for the electronic density value corresponding to the tcnq",
    "stacks the main singular spectral features are of branch - line type and the only existing border line is quite weak .",
    "in contrast , a careful analysis of the problem by means of the general pdt reveals that for the electronic density suitable to the ttf stacks the main singular features are both of branch - line and border - line type . once the preliminary studies of ttf presented in ref . @xcite",
    "involve the singular branch line features only , a very small value of @xmath181 is predicted .",
    "however , if instead one takes into account all singular features provided by the pdt , the best quantitative agreement with the ttf experimental dispersions is reached for larger values of @xmath181 , as confirmed elsewhere .    in this paper",
    "we have used the exact pdt of ref .",
    "@xcite to study the energy and momentum dependence of the one - electron removal spectral weight distribution in the vicinity of the singular and edge branch lines of the 1d hubbard model",
    ". a careful and detailed analysis of the spectral function expressions in the proximity of the charge and spin branch lines obtained here confirms the validity of the preliminary theoretical predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite , in what the description of the band tcnq dispersions observed by arpes in the quasi-1d organic compound ttf - tcnq is concerned .",
    "the tcnq conduction band displays spectroscopic signatures of spin - charge separation on an energy scale of the band width .",
    "this seems to indicate that the dominant non - perturbative many - electron microscopic processes studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of the pdt and the associated scattering mechanisms investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite control the unusual finite - energy spectral properties of ttf - tcnq .",
    "the quantitative agreement for the whole finite - energy band width between the 1d hubbard model pdt theoretically predicted spectral features and the tcnq photoemission dispersions of ttf - tcnq reveals that for finite - energy the local effects of the coulomb electronic correlations fully control the spectral properties of that material .",
    "thus , we expect that the long - range coulomb interactions , disorder , and impurity effects play very little role in the finite - energy and/or finite - temperature properties of ttf - tcnq .",
    "that disorder and impurities do not play a major role is confirmed by the occurrence of spin - charge separation for the whole energy band width .",
    "indeed , the presence of disorder and impurities would prevent the separation of the one - electron spectral - weight distribution in terms of spin and charge singular spectral features .",
    "our present finite - energy description goes beyond the usual tll low - energy investigations by means of bosonization @xcite and conformal - field theory @xcite . for low energy",
    "the present quantum problem is a tll .",
    "this concept only applies to the parts of the one - electron spectrum of fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite where the spectral dispersions can be linearized . from analysis of the figure branch lines",
    "one finds that such a regimen corresponds to low energies .",
    "however , our results refer to all values of the group velocities associated with the branch lines plotted in that figure .",
    "thus , the spin - charge separation found here corresponds to the whole finite - energy band width .",
    "only our finite - energy theoretical spectral features describe the experimental photoemission tcnq dispersions of ttf - tcnq , once the low - energy phase of ttf - tcnq is not metallic and corresponds instead to a broken - symmetry state @xcite .",
    "it follows that for the present tcnq photoemission problem , the 1d physics described by the 1d hubbard model only becomes experimentally relevant for finite energy , where the low - energy tll description does not apply .",
    "a detailed theoretical study of the the ttf experimental dispersions by means of the pdt , including consideration of both singular branch lines studied here and singular border lines is in progress and will be presented elsewhere . moreover ,",
    "the calculation of the one - electron spectral - function of the 1d hubbard model for all values of @xmath34 and @xmath179 by use of the general pdt , which consider all contributing processes , is also in progress .",
