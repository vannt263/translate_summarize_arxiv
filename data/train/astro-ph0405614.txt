    "in recent years the study of stellar ejecta released during final evolutionary stages has provided many new insights into stellar evolution .",
    "one reason for these major leaps forward have come from the advancement of near - ir imaging and spectroscopy , as well as space - based platforms ( hst , iso ) providing new views of the stellar death process .",
    "mass lost from stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) is observable as extended envelopes around planetary nebulae ( pn ) .",
    "a significant amount of material released to the ism by pn and supernovae is in the form of silicate and carbonaceous dust .",
    "tiny carbon grains , or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , have strong emission features throughout much of the near- and mid - ir spectral regions  in addition to numerous atomic and molecular features from ionized and shock heated gas .",
    "several of the brightest pn have been imaged in the mid - ir and near - ir at high spatial resolution from the ground @xcite , but the sensitivity of the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the other instruments on the spitzer space telescope @xcite will allow us to expand our knowledge beyond what was possible on the ground or previous space missions .",
    "iso provided an initial high - sensitivity look at the characteristics of pn in the mid- and far - ir @xcite .",
    "one large nearby pn that was observed by cox et al . was ngc 7293 ( the helix ) .",
    "the mid - ir emission is dominated by emission from molecular hydrogen in the ground rotational state .",
    "the brightest line , the @xmath200 @xmath3 at 6.91 @xmath0 m and the @xmath4 line at 8.02 @xmath0 m fall within the irac 8.0 @xmath0 m band , so that band is a good tracer of the h@xmath1 in pn .",
    "there will also be h@xmath1 emission in the other irac bands , e.g. the @xmath200 @xmath5 line at 5.51 @xmath0 m in the 5.8 @xmath0 m band , and the @xmath6 line at 4.69 @xmath0 m in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band , and a large number of transitions in the 3.6 @xmath0 m band @xcite .",
    "irac also will detect emission from atomic lines present in the bands , e.g. the br@xmath7 h line at 4.05 @xmath0 m in the 4.5 @xmath0 m band , and the 6.98 @xmath0 m [ ] and 8.99 @xmath0 m [ ] line in the irac 8.0 @xmath0 m band .",
    "if emission from pahs at 3.3 , 6.2 , and 7.7 @xmath0 m are present , they will contribute to the emission measured in the 3.6 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m irac bands .",
    "with irac , we are conducting a program to observe 35 pn ( program i d 68 ) .",
    "a related project with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) and infrared spectrograph ( irs ) instruments led by latter ( program i d 77 ) will obtain 24 - 160 @xmath0 m images and 5  40 @xmath0 m spectra of pn . in this paper",
    "we present images of six of the pne in the irac program , which were the first six objects observed since launch .",
    "the pn are hubble 12 ( hb 12 ) , ngc 246 , ngc 650 , ngc 2440 , ngc 3132 , and ngc 6543 .",
    "the irac observations were obtained using the 30-sec `` high dynamic range '' ( hdr ) mode .",
    "this mode takes pairs of images with 1.2 and 30 sec frame times at each position in all four channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m ; see ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for definitions of the bands ) . between 5 and 18",
    "dither positions were obtained on each source . for objects that did not approach saturation ,",
    "the 30 sec frame time data were used . for the objects that were close to or above saturation in 30 sec",
    ", the 1.2 sec frames were mosaiced and used to fill in the brightest regions of the images .    the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) products from the spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline were used to construct the mosaic images for all objects .",
    "the bcd products have the instrumental signatures removed from the data and are calibrated in units of mjy / sr , based on the calibration derived during the first few months of the mission from measurements of standard stars @xcite .",
    "two further reduction steps were performed on the bcd - first , a sky background frame was constructed from the median of the off - source images , and subtracted from the bcd frames .",
    "also , some artifacts in the pipeline images caused by bright stars were removed by forcing the column or row median in regions with no sources to be equal to that of adjacent columns or rows .",
    "the individual bcd images were combined into a single image for each channel and frame time using the ssc mosaicer .",
    "the final images have a linear pixel size 1/4 that of the input pixels ( 1/16 of the area ) . for flux calibration ,",
    "the zero magnitude fluxes in the irac bands were taken to be 277.5 .",
    "179.5 , 116.6 , and 63.1 jy for channels 1 - 4 , respectively .",
    "a correction for the extended emission was applied to the fluxes as described in the spitzer observer s manual .",

    "the magnitudes for the nebula were estimated by summing all of the detectable emission from the nebula or the particular component , and subtracting the emission from the field stars in that part of the image .",
    "column 2 indicates the size and shape of the area summed , centered on the central star of the pn . in general",
    "the total field star flux was small compared to the nebular flux , ranging from @xmath915% in the 3.6 @xmath0 m band for a couple of the pn to less than 3% in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band . where it was possible to extract the central star separately from the pn , those magnitudes and colors are also presented , as well as the nebula without the central star . since the nebulae dominate the flux from the object , the nebula - alone colors are almost the same as the total object colors .",
    "the irac color data are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color is in the @xmath90.6  1.2 range for the sample , and the [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] color is in the @xmath91.4  2.5 range .",
    "a typical error bar for the nebula is shown for one of the points ; calibration uncertainties at this time early in the mission are thought to be 0.1 mag or less in all channels",
    ". some of the [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] colors are redder than expected , e.g. , @xcite predicted [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] pn colors of less than 2 .",
    "the red [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] color is possibly due to several factors , including continuum emission from warm dust ( e.g. , hb 12 ) , or line emission from forbidden atomic lines or h@xmath1 lines in the broad 8 @xmath0 m band ( e.g. , ngc 6543 ; see discussion below ) .",
    "the iso - sws @xcite spectra of three of the pn are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the full spectrum of ngc 2440 was presented by @xcite .",
    "we show these spectra to illustrate representative spectra from some of the pn in the mid - ir .",
    "several atomic and h@xmath1 line positions are shown , not necessarily identifying them in the spectrum , but to indicate their position relative to the irac bands .",
    "no pah emission is seen in the pn spectra shown in figure 4 . also , the colors of the pn presented here are much redder than expected if the emission was caused by only pah lines @xcite .",
    "hb 12 is a young bipolar pn with a complex inner structure inside the bipolar lobes , all of which is seen in fluorescently - excited h@xmath1 emission in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "the irac image shows very little extended emission near the core , so the images are not presented here .",
    "the iso spectrum in figure 4 shows a rising continuum towards longer wavelengths , which is consistent with the observed irac colors .",
    "lines of h@xmath1 are also present , e.g. the 0  0 @xmath3 line at 6.91 @xmath0 m , and forbidden lines such as [ ] at 8.99 @xmath0 m .",
    "ngc 246 is an oval - shaped , high - excitation pn approximately 4.5 arcmin in diameter .",
    "recently , @xcite imaged ngc 246 in several near - uv lines and detected structure in the inner parts of the nebula",
    ". in particular , the image in the [ ] line at 342.9 nm shows bright arcs near the central star in an `` hourglass '' or bipolar structure near , but not centered on , the central star .",
    "the remarkable feature in the irac images is the oval structure that appears brightest in the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "this is possibly an inclined ring , and is not centered on the central star or the outer shell of the nebula .",
    "the brightest part of the pn is the c - shaped feature to the se of the central star , which is also brightest in the [ ] image .",
    "the cavity that forms the northern part of the hourglass is evident in the irac images , particularly the 4.5 @xmath0 m band , but is not as distinct as in the uv image .",
    "ngc 650 is a large , high - excitation pn with bipolar structure .",
    "the kinematic study of @xcite showed that there are several components including a central ring with two attached inner lobes , and outer lobes with much lower expansion velocities , and a higher velocity polar cap on the se side . in the near - ir ,",
    "the emission is dominated by h@xmath1 that is brightest in the central 2 arcmin region @xcite .",
    "all of the major components are seen in at least one of the irac bands .",
    "the irac bands likely contain emission from h@xmath1 as well as atomic lines .",
    "the emission seen in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band is more extended in the central ring and the lobes than the shorter bands , as evidenced by the reddish color on the outer edges seen in figure 1 .",
    "the 8.0 @xmath0 m emission in the sw extends towards the wall of one of the lobes , giving it the appearance of a red arrow pointing to the sw .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission in other pn , e.g. m 2 - 9 @xcite , or ngc 7027 @xcite , is predominantly on the outer edges of the nebula , delineating the ionization front .",
    "@xcite detected a polar cap in the se part of the nebula with a higher velocity than the surrounding shell .",
    "the cap is faintly visible in the irac bands , clearest in the 8.0 @xmath0 m image .",
    "we see a faint extended structure on the nw side that could be the opposing cap . also , @xmath950   to the se of the central star there are three small emission features about 5   long , oriented radially from the central star . they are bluer than the other features , and could be material ejected along the poles of the pn .",
    "the pn ngc 2440 is a high - excitation , point - symmetric nebula with at least three sets of opposing knots of emission . around the inner parts of the nebula",
    "is a circular shell of emission , not centered on the symmetric inner structure .",
    "there are radial `` spokes '' of emission extending from the central knots to the outer circular ring at several locations .",
    "these structures are all seen in h@xmath1 emission in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "the appearance in the irac bands is similar , with all the major features apparent .",
    "the relative brightness of the features varies in the bands , with the outer shell much fainter at the longer wavelengths .",
    "the iso spectrum does nt show any bright emission lines , except possibly the 7.64 @xmath0 m line of which would be detected in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band .",
    "ngc 3132 appears ellipsoidal in low resolution images , however a simple shell model does not explain all of the observed characteristics . @xcite",
    "propose a model in which the nebula has an hourglass structure that is being viewed at 40  relative to the light of sight .",
    "this structure explains the details of the morphology and the low central density observed in the optical images .",
    "the irac images are similar to the optical and near - ir in the central regions , with the 8.0 @xmath0 m emission relatively brighter in the outer regions .",
    "one interesting feature in the irac images is the faint extended emission approximately n - s along the major axis of the bright shell .",
    "there are what appears to be partial rings , and filaments connecting the rings radially with respect to the central star , and many knots and loops of emission that extend up to approximately three times the size of the bright optical nebula .",
    "it is surprising given the proposed model that this extended emission would appear along this axis , rather that the perpendicular axis where the major axis of the lobes are proposed to exist .",
    "in fact , the nebula does not appear to extend very much at all in the e - w direction beyond the bright optical nebula .",
    "ngc 6543 ( the `` cat s eye '' ) is another point - symmetric nebula with a complex set of bubbles , rings , shock fronts , jets , and fast , low - ionization emission - line regions ( fliers ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these are most clearly visible in the hst images of this pn , e.g. , in lines of [ ] and [ ] @xcite .",
    "the near - ir appearance is similar to the optical @xcite , with the prominent features being the oval - shaped rings at right angles to each other .",
    "the irac images are similar to the near - ir and optical broad - band images , also showing the oval rings as the main features .",
    "the fliers are more prominent at these wavelengths , especially in the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands .",
    "the iso spectrum of ngc 6543 shows bright lines of h ( br@xmath7 at 4.05 @xmath0 m ) and [ ] at 8.99 @xmath0 m which might affect the flux in the 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands , but otherwise the emission is not detected in the 3  10 @xmath0 m range of the iso spectrum in figure 4 .",
    "in addition to the bright inner region , there is a faint roughly circular halo extending to a radius of approximately 170   @xcite .",
    "the halo has a faint smooth component , but near the nebula exhibits concentric rings in [ ] , and the outer rim is dominated by cometary - shaped `` flocculi '' , the brightest being directly west of center .",
    "the appearance of the core and outer halo is similar in the irac bands ( the concentric rings are not observable at irac s angular resolution ) .",
    "there are some differences between the optical and irac images in the structure of the largest knot .",
    "the knot is relatively brighter at longer wavelengths , and the peak moves farther away from the center as one moves longer in wavelength . in the 8.0 @xmath0 m image",
    ", the brightest spot appears behind the front of the cometary front , and there is much more structure s of the knot .",
    "recent ground - based images @xcite show that the knot has significant h@xmath1 emission at 2.12 @xmath0 m , so there is likely some emission from the 0  0 @xmath5 line in the 5.8 @xmath0 m band and the @xmath4 and @xmath3 lines in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band .",
    "the irac colors of pn are red , especially when considering the 8.0 @xmath0 m band which is likely due to contributions from two strong h@xmath1 lines and a [ ] line in that bandpass , in addition to thermal continuum emission from dust .",
    "pah emission is not detected in the objects presented here , but is expected to be present in other pn . in ngc 246 , we have observed an unexpected ring of emission in the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath0 m irac bands not seen previously at other wavelengths . in ngc 650 and",
    "ngc 3132 , the 8.0 @xmath0 m emission is at larger distances from the central star compared to the optical and other irac bands , possibly related to the h@xmath1 emission in that band and the tendency for the molecular material to exist outside of the ionized zones . in the flocculi of the outer halo of ngc 6543 , however , the 8.0",
    "@xmath0 m emission is brightest on the inner edges of the structures .",
    "this may be related to the emission mechanism , where the h@xmath1 is possibly excited in shocks in the ngc 6543 halo , whereas the emission is likely fluorescently excited in the uv fields near the central star .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by jpl , caltech , under nasa contract 1407 .",
