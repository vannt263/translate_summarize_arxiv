    "the tachocline is a thin layer ( of radial extent @xmath0  mm ) located at the base of the solar convection zone where the rotation changes from differential to the rigid rotation ( e.g. , charbonneau _ et al .",
    "this layer is important in dynamo models for the generation and the storage of the toroidal fields .",
    "however the thinness of this layer made the confinement of the tachocline an intriguing problem .",
    "spiegel & zahn ( 1992 ) invoked strong anisotropic turbulent viscosity in the horizontal direction for the confinement of the tachocline .",
    "however several authors ( e.g. , rudiger & kitchatinov , 1997 ; gough & mcintyre 1998 ) realized this purely hydrodynamical model to be inappropriate and proposed an alternative mechanism for the angular momentum transport .",
    "they have shown that a strongly anisotropic angular momentum transport is possible by invoking a weak fossil magnetic field in the radiative zone .",
    "this so - called _ slow tachocline _",
    "model was later found to be questionable ( e.g. , brun & zahn , 2006 ; strugarek , brun & zahn 2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "another plausible explanation for the confinement of the tachocline was that the maxwell stress of the dynamo generated fields can provide a strong anisotropic angular momentum transport in the horizontal direction . for this mechanism to work",
    ", the dynamo - generated oscillatory magnetic field must penetrate the tachocline , which requires the value of the turbulent diffusivity to be @xmath1  @xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "this is known as the _ fast tachocline _ mechanism ( forgacs - dajka & petrovay 2001 , 2002 ; forgacs - dajka 2003 ) .    in the fast tachocline scenario ,",
    "the thickness of the tachocline depends on the magnetic field in a nonlinear way . on the other hand",
    ", the thickness of the tachocline is an important input parameter of flux transport dynamo models .",
    "therefore it is expected to affect the dynamo solution in an unexpected way .",
    "it is not even a priori clear whether the fast tachocline scenario and the  are compatible at all .",
    "the objective of the present work is to couple the simple feedback formula capturing the essential physics of the  in a  and to see its response .",
    "details can be found in karak & petrovay ( 2013 ) .",
    "following forgcs - dajka & petrovay ( 2001 ) the approximate relation between the mean ( cycle averaged ) tachocline thickness and maxwell stress can be written as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the mean diffusivity in the tachocline , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are the means value of the toroidal and the poloidal field in the tachocline defined in the following way .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 + while @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the local radially averaged values of the toroidal and the poloidal field calculated as    @xmath13 with @xmath14 , and    @xmath15 with @xmath16 + note that the above relation ( [ eq : fits2new ] ) is strictly valid for the average ( temporal and the latitudinal ) values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , not for the actual values at a given point in space and time .",
    "however it is worthwhile to use the above simple physically motivated relation to explore its effect in the dynamo model .",
    "we use above relation for the tachocline thickness in a flux transport dynamo model ( see choudhuri 2011 for recent review ) . for the dynamo calculations we use the _ surya _ code ( chatterjee , nandy & choudhuri 2004 ) with modified parameters presented in karak & petrovay ( 2013 ) .",
    "usually the  uses fixed value of the  thickness . here",
    ", however , we consider a variable tachocline thickness based on eq .",
    "[ eq : fits2new ] . the result for this calculation",
    "is shown in figure [ maxt ] .",
    "it is interesting to note is that this produces a stable solar - like dynamo solution .",
    "in addition , it produces a variable tachocline ; the cyclic variation of thickness is somewhat larger ( up to @xmath19 ) than the observational limit ( e.g. , antia & basu 2011 ) .     as given by eq .",
