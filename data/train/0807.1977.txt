    "exclusive @xmath0 electroproduction from nucleons and nuclei allows one to extract the chiral odd generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , the tensor charge , and other quantities related to transversity , from experimental data @xcite . in this reaction",
    "only the c - parity odd combinations quantum numbers of the t - channel exchanges are , in fact , selected . in a description in terms of partonic degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _ based on the handbag diagram at leading order , the helicity structure for this c - odd process relates to the quark helicity flip , or chiral odd generalized parton distributions whose integrals were shown to be related to the tensor charge @xmath2 , and to the transverse anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath3 .",
    "this differs markedly from deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , and from both vector meson and charged @xmath4 electroproduction , where the axial charge can enter the amplitudes .",
    "in this talk , we start from writing the cross section and spin asymmetries for @xmath5 using the helicity amplitudes formalism .",
    "we then study the sensitivity of the various compoments of the cross section , and of the target transverse asymmetry , @xmath6 , to both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in kinematical ranges where experimental data are currently being analysed .",
    "the compton form factor , @xmath7 , containing the chiral even gpd , @xmath8 was already extracted with high accuracy from the data , using cross section and bean spin asymmetries measurements . within our suggested scenario ,",
    "the presently analysed @xmath0 electroproduction data , as well as future measurements , will allow one to obtain information on @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , containing the chiral - odd gpds , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we subsequently discuss the structure of our gpds parametrization in relation with the constraints obtained from the data .",
    "the differential cross section for pion electroproduction off an unpolarized target is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon polarization parameter , and for longitudinal polarization alone , @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is a kinematical factor including the mott cross section , @xmath17 . the different contributions in eq.([unp - xs ] ) are written in terms of helicity amplitudes , for instance ( we use the notation : @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 with @xmath20^{-1 } \\ ,",
    "g$ ] , where we used the hand convention , multiplied by a geometrical factor @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to the unpolarized observables listed above , a number of observables directly connected to transversity can be written ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . here we show the transversely polarized target asymmetry , @xmath22    it is important to realize that the relations between observables and helicity amplitudes is general , independent of any particular model . in @xcite",
    "we , in fact , used the formalism above in both a regge model , as well as using gpds .",
    "the connection with the parton model and the transversity distribution is uncovered through the gpd decomposition of the helicity amplitudes . in the factorization scenario",
    "the amplitudes for exclusive @xmath23 electroproduction , @xmath24 can be decomposed into a `` hard part '' , @xmath25 and a `` soft part '' , @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 are the initial ( final ) proton helicities , and @xmath28 are the initial ( final ) quark helicities ) through the products of @xmath29 amplitudes , @xmath25 , with the matching quark - hadron helicity structures that , in turn , contain the gpds , in the form    @xmath30    the @xmath26 structures are functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; they are analogous to the compton form factors in dvcs .",
    "they implicitly contain an integration over unobserved quark momenta . because only one of the @xmath33 transverse photon functions is non - zero @xcite , the relation to the quark - hadron amplitudes is quite simple _ note that",
    "because of the pion chirality , 0@xmath34 , the quark must flip helicity at the pion vertex _ ,    @xmath35    where we wrote explicitly the @xmath32-dependence of the @xmath33 functions from the pion vertex , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , for each amplitude .",
    "these depend on whether the @xmath0 is produced within an interaction with a vector or an axial vector meson ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "similar expressions containing bilinear products of the imaginary and real parts of the quark - hadron amplitudes , @xmath38 , can be written for the other contributions .",
    "a formal proof of factorization was given only in the case of longitudinally polarized virtual photons producing longitudinally polarized vector mesons @xcite .",
    "endpoint contributions are surmised to be larger in electroproduction of transversely polarized vector mesons , and to therefore prevent factorization .",
    "notwithstanding current theoretical approaches , many measurements conducted through the years , display larger transverse contributions than expected @xcite . in this paper",
    "we suggest as an alternative avenue a qcd based model , that predicts different @xmath32 behaviors for meson production via natural and unnatural parity exchanges .    at leading order , using the notations of ref.@xcite ,",
    "one can write the helicity amplitudes in terms of linear combinations of meson production form factors ( mpffs ) .",
    "the mpffs defining @xmath0 production are @xmath39\\ ] ] with @xmath40 , and the corresponding @xmath41 defined in terms of the chiral odd - gpds , @xmath42 as : @xmath43 + \\mathcal{p } \\int\\limits_{-1+\\zeta}^1 dx \\left(\\frac{1}{x-\\zeta } + \\frac{1}{x } \\right ) f^q(x,\\zeta , t ) .",
    "\\label{cal_f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we performed calculations using a phenomenologically constrained model from the parametrization of refs.@xcite .",
    "we summarize the ahlt model for the unpolarized gpd .",
    "the parameterization s form is :    @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a regge motivated term that describes the low @xmath46 and @xmath47 behaviors , while the contribution of @xmath48 , obtained using a spectator model , is centered at intermediate / large values of @xmath46 : @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the initial and final quark momenta respectively ; explicit expressions are given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath52 behavior is constrained by enforcing both the forward limit : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the valence quarks distribution , and the following relations :        which define the connection with the quark s contribution to the nucleon form factors .",
    "notice the ahlt parametrization does not make use of a `` profile function '' for the parton distributions , but the forward limit , @xmath56 , is enforced non trivially .",
    "this affords us the flexibility that is necessary to model the behavior at @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58-dependent constraints are given by the higher moments of gpds .",
    "the @xmath59 moments of the ns combinations : @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are available from lattice qcd @xcite , @xmath62 corresponding to the nucleon form factors . in a recent analysis",
    "a parametrization was devised that takes into account all of the above constraints .",
    "the parametrization gives an excellent description of recent jefferson lab data in the valence region .",
    "the connection to the transversity gpds is carried out similarly to refs.@xcite for the forward case by setting : @xmath63 where @xmath2 is the tensor charge , and @xmath64 is the tensor anomalous moment introduced , and connected to the transverse component of the total angular momentum in @xcite .",
    "notice that our unpolarized gpd model can be adequately extended to describe @xmath11 since it was developed in the valence region , and transversity involves valence quarks only .    in fig.[fig1",
    "] we show the sensitivity of @xmath6 to to the values of the u - quark and d - quark tensor charges .",
    "the values in the figure were taken by varying up to @xmath65 the values of the tensor charge extracted from the global analysis of ref.@xcite , _ i.e. _ @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and fixing the transverse anomalous magnetic moment values to @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this is the main result of this contribution : it summarizes our proposed method for a practical extraction of the tensor charge from @xmath0 electroproduction experiments . therefore our model can be used to constrain the range of values allowed by the data .",
