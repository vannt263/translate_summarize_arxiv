    "the title of this paper is not only provocative but also ambiguous .",
    "there are two ways to understand the expression `` mathematical semantics '' , which reflect two different facets of the present work .      in the first reading , ``",
    "semantics '' is understood informally , as a conceptual explanation ; and `` mathematics '' is understood on a par with other fields of study .",
    "traditional ways to understand intuitionistic logic ( semantically ) have been rooted either in philosophy  with emphasis on the development of knowledge ( brouwer , heyting , kripke ) or in computer science  with emphasis on effective operations ( kleene , markov , curry ",
    "we develop kolmogorov s approach @xcite , which emphasizes the right order of quantifiers , and is rooted in the mathematical tradition , dating back to the antiquity , of _ solving of problems _",
    "( such as geometric construction problems ) and in the mathematical ideas of _ method _ ( of solution or proof ) and _ canonicity _ ( of a mathematical object ) .",
    "the approach of kolmogorov has enjoyed some limited appreciation in europe in the 1930s , and had a deeper and more lasting impact on the moscow school of logic  but nowadays is widely seen as a mere historical curiosity .",
    "one important reason for that could have been the lack of a sufficiently clear formulation and of any comprehensive exposition of intuitionistic logic based on this idea .",
    "the present paper attempts to remedy this defect .",
    "thus we introduce ( i ) a tiny revision of kolmogorov s interpretation of intuitionistic logic (  [ clarified ] ) , which attempts to clarify matters from the viewpoint of traditional mathematical intuitions , and to achieve the independence from `` any special , e.g.   intuitionistic , epistemological presuppositions '' that kolmogorov has announced , but arguably not quite achieved in his own paper ; ( ii ) more substantially , an extension and a modification of the clarified kolmogorov interpretation (  [ extended ] and  [ modified ] ) , which additionally include an interpretation of the syntactic consequence relation , and are compatible with several classes of models of intuitionistic logic .      in the second reading of the title ,",
    "`` semantics '' is understood formally , in the sense of ( mathematical ) models ; and `` mathematics '' is understood in the sense of the outlook of the so - called `` working mathematician '' , who professes ignorance in the foundations and has little interest in notions motivated by the foundations ( such as heyting algebras or kripke frames ) . in this view , `` real mathematics '' is mostly concerned with notions that have a `` universal '' significance , as judged by their appeal to general mathematical audiences and their presence in several branches of mathematics , and somewhat disdains more peripheral activities . even if this standpoint involves too much arrogance and too little concern for diversity ,",
    "one can not simply ignore it ; if intuitionistic logic has seen much more applications and enthusiasm in computer science and in philosophical logic than in non - foundational mathematics , it could be attributed in part to the scarcity of logicians interest in `` real mathematical '' models of intuitionistic logic .    our introduction to some basic themes of intuitionistic logic (  [ topology ] ) is in the language of its usual topological models , in which parameterless formulas are interpreted by open subsets of a topological space .",
    "these were discovered independently by stone , tang and tarski in the 1930s but largely went out of fashion since the 60s .",
    "( however , in the propositional case these models include  by considering finite topological spaces and other alexandroff spaces  all kripke models , which have had far better luck with fashion . )",
    "a methodological novelty is a motivation of these topological models through a model in `` euler diagrams '' of a classical first - order theory extracted from the clauses of kolmogorov s interpretation (  [ weak bhk ] ) .",
    "we then introduce `` proof - relevant '' topological models (  [ sheaves ] ) of intuitionistic logic , in which parameterless formulas are interpreted by sheaves of sets over a space @xmath0 ; these should not be confused with the usual `` sheaf models '' ( see @xcite and references there ) , in which parameterless formulas are interpreted by open subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "quite expectedly , our models turned out to be a special case of something well - known : the _ categorical semantics _",
    "@xcite ) , and more specifically palmgren s models of intuitionistic logic in _ locally cartesian closed categories with finite sums _ @xcite . quite unexpectedly , this very simple and natural special case with obvious relevance for the informal semantics of intuitionistic logic does not seem to have been considered per se ( apart from what amounts to the @xmath1 fragment @xcite ) . we prove completeness of intuitionistic logic with respect to our sheaf - valued models by showing that in a certain rather special case ( sheaves over zero - dimensional separable metrizable spaces ) they interpret the usual topological models over the same space . normally ( e.g.  for sheaves over euclidean spaces or alexandroff spaces ) this is far from being so .",
    "on the other hand , our sheaf - valued models also interpret medvedev  skvortsov models (  [ medvedev - skvortsov ] ) .",
    "this unconventional introduction to intuitionistic logic should suffice for the purposes of the author s papers @xcite , @xcite , but as such it does not pretend to be complete or even finished .",
    "it is hoped that a future version will cover certain additional topics and will be accompanied by an unconventional introduction to homotopy type theory .",
    "i am indebted to a. bauer , l. beklemishev , m. bezem , k. doen , n. polyakov for useful feedback and improving my knowledge of some basic things .",
    "i m also grateful to t. coquand , d. grayson , h. gylterud , s. kuznetsov , k. mineshima , d. saveliev , g. schlaepfer , o. k. sheinman and g. tolokonnikov for stimulating discussions . a part of this work was carried out while enjoying the hospitality and stimulating atmosphere of the institute for advanced study and its univalent foundations program in spring 2013 .",
    "there i gradually realized that in order to achieve my goals related to univalent foundations i first need a better understanding of intuitionistic logic ; and o. viro further convinced me that in order to truly understand the latter , i have no choice but to recreate it in a way more compatible with the mentality of a `` working mathematician '' .",
    "i m also grateful d. botin and d. cenzer , who taught me some bits of logic many years ago .",
    "in 1900 , hilbert published ( and partly presented in his lecture at the international congress of mathematicians in paris ) a list of 23 open problems in mathematics @xcite .",
    "shortly before the 100th anniversary of the list , the historian rdiger thiele discovered a would - be 24th problem in hilbert s notebooks @xcite ( for a photocopy see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we do nt know why hilbert refrained from publicizing it , but one obvious possibility is that he simply did not see how to state it precisely enough .    a rather narrow understanding of the problem , as merely asking for `` a criterion of simplicity in mathematical proofs and the development of a proof theory with the power to prove that a given proof is the simplest possible '' has became widespread in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite*p .  38 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , hilbert s original text above is unambiguously posing a totally different problem as well ( in the two sentences starting with `` quite generally '' ) : to develop a proof theory that can tell whether two given proofs of a theorem are `` essentially same '' , or _ homotopic _",
    ", in the sense that one can _ derive each from the other _ ( whatever that means ) .",
    "it is this aspect of the 24th problem that we shall be concerned with .",
    "moreover , hilbert s reference to syzygies between syzygies is obviously of abelian groups : @xmath2 .",
    "write @xmath3 to mean @xmath4 , and @xmath5 to mean that @xmath3 and @xmath6 are homologous relative to @xmath7 , that is , @xmath8",
    ". then the identity type @xmath9 will be the following pointed chain complex : @xmath10 .",
    "] provoking one to think of a hypothetical space of proofs of a given theorem and of whether it should be acyclic or contractible ( so that proofs can be simplified in a canonical way ) under a given set of conditions .    certainly , hilbert was not alone in being concerned with ( informal ) questions of this kind . for instance , a sample of attempts by mathematicians other than proof theorists at judging `` essential sameness '' of certain proofs ( of the irrationality of @xmath11 and of gauss quadratic reciprocity law ) can be found in t. gowers blog @xcite .",
    "a more systematic study of the question of identity of proofs has taken place in intuitionistic proof theory , starting in the 70s ( prawitz @xcite , kreisel @xcite , martin - lf @xcite ; see a brief survey in @xcite*2 ) and continued in the context of higher categories and higher @xmath12-calculus @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the more recent approach of homotopy type theory @xcite is to a large extent a development of this proof - theoretic tradition .",
    "we should also point out some very different approaches to somewhat similar questions , which can not be discussed here in detail : @xcite ( and references there ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite*8.2 , @xcite .",
    "so how to judge if two proofs of a theorem are `` essentially same '' ?",
    "hilbert s idea that there might be the _",
    "simplest _ proof of a theorem @xmath13 and his mention of the _ use _ of variant conditions ( and aids ) in proving @xmath13 establish a context where it seems natural to identify a proof @xmath14 of @xmath13 with every its _ simplification _ , that is , a proof of @xmath13 obtained from @xmath14 by crossing out some redundant steps .",
    "of course , the notion of a `` redundant step '' ( or a step that is not `` essentially used '' in the proof ) needs an accurate definition ; we will return to this issue later .    on the other hand , hilbert s words",
    "( `` keep _ going _ until you have _ derived _ each from the other '' ) may seem to hint at a formal theory of proofs containing a number of specified elementary transformations between proofs of the same assertion . in this case",
    "the relation of _ homotopy _ between proofs of the same assertion can be defined as the equivalence relation generated by elementary transformations .",
    "such formal theories endowed with elementary transformations between proofs are best known in the case of constructive proofs ( in particular , the natural deduction system of gentzen  prawitz and the corresponding @xmath12-calculus , see @xcite ) . before turning to constructive proofs , let us review the situation with usual , non - constructive ones .",
    "a standard theory of derivations based on classical logic is gentzen s sequent calculus @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the elementary inferences    ( @xmath15 ) from @xmath16 and @xmath17 infer @xmath18 ;    ( @xmath19 ) from @xmath20 infer @xmath21 ;    ( @xmath22 ) from @xmath21 infer @xmath18 ;    ( @xmath23 ) from @xmath21 infer @xmath24 ;    ( @xmath25 ) from @xmath0 infer @xmath17    can be interpreted as instances of the inference rules of sequent calculus . ) can be interpreted as an instance of the cut rule , ( @xmath19 ) as an instance of the right contraction rule , ( @xmath22 ) and ( @xmath25 ) as instances of the right and left weakening rules , and ( @xmath23 ) as ( @xmath22 ) followed by an instance of the exchange rule . ]",
    "a number of elementary transformations between derivations of the same proposition in sequent calculus can be found in the proof of gentzen s hauptsatz on cut elimination ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath26-transformations _ include , in particular , the following ( @xmath27 ) and ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "( @xmath27 ) suppose that @xmath29 is a proof of @xmath17 .",

    "we note that ( @xmath27 ) can be seen as a simplifying transformation : it eliminates the proof @xmath29 of the redundant lemma @xmath17 at the cost of replacing one weakening ( @xmath21 implies @xmath16 ) by another ( @xmath21 implies @xmath18 ) .",
    "( @xmath28 ) suppose that @xmath14 is a proof of @xmath16 .",

    "we can see it explicitly by rewriting @xmath17 and @xmath16 respectively as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , using tautologies of classical logic .",
    "let us also consider two additional _ @xmath32-transformations _ :    ( @xmath33 ) , ( @xmath34 ) : the following fragment of a proof can be eliminated :    * @xmath21 implies @xmath20 by ( @xmath22 ) or by ( @xmath23 ) ; * @xmath20 implies @xmath21 by ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "all proofs of any given theorem are equivalent modulo @xmath26- and @xmath32-transformations .",
    "lafont s own summary of his result is that `` classical logic is inconsistent , not from the logical viewpoint ( [ falsity ] is not provable ) but from an algorithmic one . ''",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath29 be proofs of a theorem @xmath13 .",
    "they can be augmented to yield a proof @xmath35 of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is some fixed assertion , and a proof @xmath38 of the implication @xmath39 .",
    "combining the latter two proofs , we obtain a proof @xmath40 of the assertion @xmath41 .",
    "hence we get a third proof , @xmath42 , of @xmath13 , which we will denote @xmath43 for brevity .",
    "is also found in artemov s system lp ( logic of proofs ) @xcite . ]",
    "it remains to show that @xmath43 can be reduced to @xmath14 , as well as to @xmath29 by @xmath26- and @xmath32-transformations .",
    "indeed , @xmath27 reduces @xmath43 to the proof @xmath44 of @xmath13 ( which augments @xmath14 by saying that @xmath13 implies @xmath45 , which in turn implies @xmath13 ) .",
    "the latter proof is reduced to @xmath14 by @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , @xmath28 reduces @xmath43 to the proof @xmath46 of @xmath13 , which in turn is reduced to @xmath29 by @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that , despite lafont s theorem , some authors , including doen @xcite ( see details in @xcite ; see also @xcite and references there ) and guglielmi @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite and references there ) have been able to find inequivalent proofs in the framework of classical logic .",
    "one issue with @xmath26-transformations is that ( @xmath27 ) does not merely eliminate @xmath29 , but only does so at the expense of changing a weakening .",
    "so it is not immediately clear that the lemma @xmath17 is redundant in the initial proof of ( @xmath27 ) , in the strict sense of not being used at all in that proof .    to address this concern ,",
    "let us revisit lafont s construction . recall that we were free to choose any assertion as @xmath37 .",
    "we can set @xmath37 , for instance , to be the negation @xmath47 ( any weaker assertion , such as @xmath48 , would also do ) .",
    "then @xmath36 holds in classical logic regardless of validity of @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the step @xmath22 of the proof @xmath43 replaces the proved theorem @xmath13 with the tautology @xmath36 .",
    "the effect of this step is that we forget all that we have learned from the proof @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath43 does not essentially use @xmath14 , so @xmath14 must be redundant even in the stricter sense .    on the other hand , we could take @xmath37 to be @xmath13 itself ( any stronger assertion , for instance @xmath49 , would also do ) . then the step @xmath25 replaces the proved theorem @xmath13 by the tautology @xmath39 .",
    "the effect of this step is that we forget all that we have learned from @xmath29 , and we similarly conclude that @xmath29 must be redundant .",
    "however , it appears that the meaning of the proof @xmath43 should not vary depending on the strength of @xmath37 , since for the purposes of this proof we did not need to know anything at all about @xmath37 .",
    "our conclusion , that neither @xmath14 nor @xmath29 is `` essentially used '' in @xmath43 , shows that the notion of a proof `` essentially using '' its part can not be sensibly formalized in the framework of classical logic .",
    "it turns out , however , that this notion can be consistently defined once we abandon classical logic in favor of intuitionistic .",
    "in contrast to classical logic , where one can sometimes prove that a certain object exists without giving its explicit construction , proofs in intuitionistic logic can be interpreted , at least roughly , as algorithms ( the curry  howard correspondence , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath50 is a set , an intuitionistic proof of the assertion `` @xmath50 is nonempty '' can be roughly thought of as a program ( executed on a turing machine , say ) that returns a specific element of @xmath50 .",
    "( these issues will be discussed more accurately in ",
    "[ bhk2 ] . )    in writing a computer program , it is not enough to know that some subsidiary computation is possible in principle ; for the program to run , every step must be actually implemented .",
    "in fact , the value of every particular variable can be chased through all dependent subroutines using a debugger .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with classical mathematics , where the particular way that a lemma is proved has absolutely no effect on the proof of the theorem modulo that lemma . in intuitionistic logic",
    ", there can be no dependence between statements other than a dependence between their specific proofs .",
    "in fact , one can think of a proposition in intuitionistic logic as being identified with the set of its proofs .",
    "( we will also return to this issue in ",
    "[ bhk2 ] . )    with the above in mind , although @xmath36 is intuitionistically a tautology as long @xmath37 is ( for instance , @xmath37 can be taken to be @xmath51 ) , the intuitionistic step @xmath22 , replacing the proved theorem @xmath13 with the tautology @xmath36 does not have the effect of forgetting how @xmath13 was proved . on the contrary",
    ", it has the effect of specifying that @xmath36 is to be proved `` via @xmath13 '' and not `` via @xmath37 '' , and extending a given proof of @xmath13 to a specific proof of @xmath36 . since the latter proof does not depend on any proof of @xmath37 , the intuitionistic step @xmath15 promotes it to a proof of @xmath41 that does not depend on any proof assuming @xmath37 as a premise .",
    "it follows that if @xmath14 and @xmath29 are constructive , then @xmath43 , understood constructively , essentially uses @xmath14 and does not essentially use @xmath29 . in agreement with this ,",
    "the intuitionistic version of the sequent calculus ( see @xcite ) admits only asymmetric interpretations of @xmath43 , which can be reduced by the intuitionistic analogues of @xmath26- and @xmath32-transformations to @xmath14 , but not to @xmath29 .",
    "in classical logic , the meaning of propositions is determined by answering the question : _ when is a given proposition true ? _ a standard answer to this question is given by tarski s definition of truth .",
    "the definition is by induction on the number of logical connectives :    * which primitive propositions are true is assumed to be known from context .    for instance , in the context of arithmetic ,",
    "a proposition of the form @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being arithmetical expressions ) is true whenever @xmath53 and @xmath54 rewrite to the same numeral .",
    "* @xmath55 is true if @xmath56 is true or @xmath57 is true ; * @xmath58 is true if @xmath56 is not true ; * @xmath59 is true if @xmath60 is true for some @xmath61",
    ".    here @xmath56 , @xmath57 are propositions , possibly with parameters , and @xmath62 is a proposition with parameter @xmath63 and possibly other parameters . in first - order logic ,",
    "all parameters are understood to run over a fixed set @xmath64 , which is called the _ domain of discourse_.    the other classical connectives @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath66 , @xmath67 do not need to be mentioned since they are expressible in terms of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "for the record , we get for them , as a consequence of the above :    * @xmath71 is true if @xmath56 is true and @xmath57 is true ; * @xmath72 is true if @xmath57 is true or @xmath56 is not true ; * @xmath73 is true if @xmath60 is true for all @xmath61",
    ".    we can also understand the latter six clauses the other way round , as an `` explanation '' of classical connectives in terms of truth of propositions .    in this paper",
    "we always assume our meta - logic to be classical ; that is , when discussing intuitionistic and other non - classical logics , we always mean _ this discussion _ to take place in classical logic .",
    "intuitionistic logic can be approached in two ways .",
    "the tradition initiated by brouwer in 1907 and continued by his school in amsterdam ( heyting , troelstra , et al . ) and elsewhere till the present day  perhaps more successfully in computer science than in mathematics  presupposes a deep rethink of the conventional understanding of what mathematics is and what it is not . in the words of troelstra and van dalen @xcite*p .  4 :    thus , in the tradition of brouwer and heyting ,",
    "propositions are considered to have a different  intuitionistic  meaning , which is determined by answering the question : _ when do we know a constructive proof of a given proposition ? _ we will return to this question in  [ bhk ] , once it will have been restated in ",
    "[ kolmogorov ] so as to avoid the terminological clash with the classical meaning of propositions .",
    "whether the classical meaning of propositions `` makes sense '' or not is a philosophical question which we will try to avoid  so as to focus on answering mathematical questions .",
    "but at the very least , the author is determined to keep good relations with the 99% of mathematicians who are convinced that the classical meaning of propositions does make sense ; and so considers the _ terminology _ of brouwer and heyting , which is in direct conflict with the convictions of the 99% of mathematicians , to be unfortunate .",
    "indeed , a useful terminology would provoke mathematical , and not philosophical questions .",
    "the depth of the rethink of mathematics promoted by the battlefield terminology of brouwer and heyting should not be underestimated . in the above quote",
    ", we are asked to abstain not only from using the principle of excluded middle ( in the form asserting that every statement is either true or false ) , but also from understanding mathematical objects with the customary mental aid of platonism ( i.e.  plato s vision of mathematical objects as ideal entities existing independently of our knowledge about them ) . to be sure ,",
    "heyting has stated it boldly enough @xcite :    the present author is no proponent of platonism , but , on the contrary , feels that properly understood mathematics should not depend on any particular philosophy ( for reasons related to occam s razor ) .",
    "heyting certainly has a point in that when we mathematicians speak of `` existence '' of mathematical objects , it is not at all clear what we mean by this ; the implicit hypothesis that this talk `` makes sense '' at all can certainly be considered as a religious dogma .",
    "however , from the viewpoint of intuitionism , it is trivial to _ understand _ classical mathematics : one just needs to explicitly mention the principle of excluded middle in the hypothesis of every classical theorem , thus transforming it into a conditional assertion .",
    "moreover , as shown and emphasized by kolmogorov @xcite , the use of this principle alone can not be the source of a contradiction ( see  [ negneg ] ) ; nor it can lead to a contradiction when combined with the axioms of first - order arithmetic ( gdel  gentzen , cf .",
    "the same is true of the second - order arithmetic ( kreisel , cf .",
    "@xcite ) and , with some additional effort , also of the set theory zf ( without the axiom of choice ) @xcite , @xcite  albeit this requires impredicative intuitionism , which is something that not all constructivists accept @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , in presence of the countable axiom of choice ( which suffices for classical analysis ) in its standard form , interpreted intuitionistically according to kolmogorov , the addition of the principle of excluded middle generally increases consistency strength even with respect to impredicative intuitionism @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the issue of precise formulation of the axiom of choice is important here ; see @xcite*2.2.4 and @xcite .",
    "this is entirely parallel to the situation within classical mathematics .",
    "some principles of classical set theory , including the continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice , are internally provable to be consistent with zf ; in particular , their addition to zf does not increase its consistency strength  or in other words , their use alone can not be the source of a contradiction . other principles , like large cardinal axioms or the axiom of determinacy are known or conjectured to increase consistency strength when added to zf ; yet there are various good reasons to believe that resulting systems are still consistent , perhaps not significantly different from the reasons for one s belief in the consistency of zf . thus classical mathematics with or without the axiom of choice should be , from the viewpoint of an intuitionist , on a par with areas of classical mathematics that depend on the said principles as seen by a classical mathematician who does not find these principles to be intuitively justified .",
    "conversely , it would be beneficial to _ understand _ intuitionistic logic and its relations with classical logic in a way that is compatible with the plain platonic intuition arguably shared by most `` working mathematicians '' .",
    "first attempts at meaning explanations of intuitionistic logic in terms of ordinary practices of classical mathematics can be found in a 1928 paper by orlov @xcite*6,7 ( see also @xcite ) and in the 1930 and 1931 papers by heyting @xcite , @xcite .",
    "both orlov and heyting gave explanations ( see @xcite*[g1:letters1 ] for a detailed review )  in terms of provability of propositions ( `` propositions '' and `` provability '' being understood in a sense compatible with classical logic ) which directly anticipate gdel s 1933 provability translation  to be reviewed in ",
    "[ provability ] .",
    "gdel s translation certainly yields an accurate explanation in classical terms of the form of intuitionistic logic , as captured by heyting s axioms and inference rules .",
    "but it misses the spirit of intuitionistic logic ( as understood in the present paper ) , in that it does not explain how one proposition can have essentially different proofs .      the second approach to intuitionistic logic , initiated by kolmogorov and continued to some extent by his school in moscow aimed at being less demanding of one s philosophical preferences .",
    "in the words of kolmogorov @xcite :    in this paper , we use the word _ problem _ solely in the sense of a request ( or desire ) to find a construction meeting specified criteria on output and permitted means ( as in `` chess problem '' , `` geometric construction problem '' , `` initial value problem '' ) . with _",
    "problem _ understood in this sense , kolmogorov s interpretation is , in the words of martin - lf @xcite*p .  6 ,    as a matter of convention",
    ", we will always understand a _",
    "solution _ of a problem positively , in that a proof that a problem @xmath74 has no solutions is not considered to be a solution of @xmath74 .",
    "instead , we consider it to be a solution of a different problem , denoted @xmath75 ; and the problem of either finding a solution of @xmath74 or proving that one does not exist is denoted @xmath76 .",
    "we say that @xmath74 is _ solvable _ if @xmath74 has a solution , and _ decidable _ if @xmath76 has a solution .",
    "a problem of the form @xmath76 may in general be very hard .",
    "there is nothing surprising here , of course , since the law of excluded middle applies to propositions , whereas @xmath74 is a problem .",
    "nevertheless , the principle of decidability of every mathematical problem has been stressed forcefully by hilbert in the preface to his famous list of problems @xcite :    a counterexample to hilbert s ascription of his conviction to all mathematicians was soon provided by brouwer , who himself fiercely opposed it @xcite*statement xxi , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "yet one can hardly deny that the task of _ settlement _ , in the sense of hilbert , of mathematical problems ( including , indeed , those in hilbert s list ) , i.e. , the task of solving problems of the form @xmath76 , is something that we mathematicians all constantly undertake , with great efforts  including those 99% of us who consider the law of excluded middle to be a triviality , which can be used freely whenever the need arises .",
    "we thus come to distinguish the _ law of excluded middle _ ( for propositions ) and the _ principle of decidability _",
    "( for problems ) . yet the two have been systematically conflated by heyting ( see @xcite and @xcite*p .",
    "235 ) and especially by brouwer ; in fact , their conflation was at the very source of brouwer s opposition to the law of excluded middle , whose first published record @xcite reads :    this all is remarkably similar to what one could say about the _ problem _ of `` embedding of one system in another '' ( whatever that means ) , except for the alleged connection with the law of excluded middle .",
    "twenty years later , brouwer has even complained that after his repeated declarations that the law of excluded middle is the same as the principle of decidability , hilbert still fails to recognize their alleged identity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , neither this complaint nor the repeated declarations cited in it seem to bring in any arguments as to why the two principles should be equated ( apart from the insistence that they obviously should ) .",
    "in fact , in the opinion of kolmogorov @xcite ,      obviously , brouwer committed what most mathematicians still do today : he conflated a problem ( understood as a request for finding , for instance , a proof of a certain assertion , according to a certain specification of what counts as a proof ) with a conjecture ( understood as a judgement that a certain assertion is true ) .",
    "indeed , most of hilbert s problems consist in proving a conjecture .",
    "let us take , for instance , his first problem , which asks to prove the continuum hypothesis ( @xmath77 ) : _ every infinite subset of @xmath78 is of the same cardinality as @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "_    is it the case that @xmath77 is either true or false ? yes : this is a theorem of zfc  a direct consequence of the law of excluded middle .",

    "so , is @xmath77 false ? not really",
    ": @xmath77 can not be disproved in zfc , as shown by gdel .",
    "this is why in modern classical logic , _ truth _ is considered to be a semantic notion , depending on the choice of a two - valued model of the theory ( cf .  ",

    "indeed , @xmath80 is decidable ( by cohen ) , @xmath81 is decidable ( by gdel ) , and even @xmath82 is decidable ( by gdel & cohen ) .",

    "in particular , the introduction into intuitionistic logic found in his 1934 book @xcite is based on kolmogorov s understanding of the connectives ( apart from @xmath85 , which heyting interpreted differently ) . more influential , however , was his later return to the ideologically loaded language of brouwer , most notably in his 1956 book @xcite .",

    "this does not pretend to be a fully unambiguous definition , but `` hopefully can not lead to confusion in specific areas of mathematics '' .",
    "the seemingly innocuous interpretations of @xmath68 and @xmath70 are already in sharp contrast with classical logic .",

    "an important clarification to the bhk interpretation , emphasized by kreisel ( with a focus on the @xmath66 and @xmath67 clauses ; see details and further discussion in @xcite and @xcite*5.1 ) , is that a solution of a problem must not only consist of a construction ( such as a general method ) of a prescribed type , but also include a proof that the proposed construction does solve the problem .",
    "in fact , this point is found already in proclus ancient commentary on euclid s elements ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the significance of this provision is illustrated by the following _ schwichtenberg s paradox_. let us consider the problem @xmath115 of proving the following proposition @xmath116 : @xmath117 of course , it is trivial to devise a general method @xmath118 that will verify the inequality @xmath119 and thus solve @xmath115 for every particular choice of positive integers @xmath120 and @xmath121 for which it can be solved .",
    "what is hard is to prove that @xmath118 actually succeeds on all inputs .",
    "thus it is only due to kreisel s clarification that the problem @xmath122 ( with @xmath123 ranging over all positive integers ) is nontrivial .",
    "in fact , due to the existence of @xmath118 , the latter problem is equivalent to the problem @xmath124 of proving fermat s last theorem . ) , which indicates that he did implicitly assume general methods to include verification of their own correctness and seems to have been aware of the significance of this provision . in his paper @xcite",
    ", he also emphasized universal acceptability of the validity of solutions as an inherent property of logical and mathematical problems . ]",
    "let us now discuss the meaning of the negation , @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath125 denote the proposition : _ there exists a solution of @xmath74_. using @xmath126 as before , and writing @xmath69 also for the classical negation of propositions , we get the problem @xmath127 , which reads : _ prove that @xmath74 has no solutions_.

    "we will now argue that this problem is equivalent to @xmath75 on the bhk interpretation ( with our classical meta - logic ) , by describing solutions of the problems @xmath128 and @xmath129 .    indeed , suppose that we have a solution of @xmath75 , that is , a general method @xmath118 of obtaining a solution of @xmath90 based on any given solution of @xmath74 , including a proof that this method works .",
    "but since @xmath90 has no solutions , we get the following proof @xmath130 that @xmath74 has no solutions : `` if @xmath54 is a solution of @xmath74 , then @xmath118 applied to @xmath54 yields a non - existent object , which is a contradiction ; thus @xmath74 has no solutions . ''",
    "moreover , it is clear that the procedure associating @xmath130 to @xmath118 is a general method , which works regardless of the nature of @xmath118 .",

    "thus , given a @xmath14 , we get a general method @xmath131 of obtaining a solution of @xmath90 on the basis of any given solution @xmath54 of @xmath74 ; namely , @xmath131 returns @xmath54 itself and includes a verification that @xmath54 is a solution of @xmath90 ( which is given by @xmath14 ) .",
    "thus @xmath131 is a solution of @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the procedure associating @xmath131 to @xmath14 is a general method , which works regardless of the nature of @xmath14 .",
    "curiously , this analysis is at odds with kolmogorov s remark @xcite :    could one make any sense out of the last sentence , mathematically ? it could be referring , for instance , to the fact that the existence of a well - ordering of the continuum might be ( i ) not provable in some formal theory @xmath132 ( such as zf ) , yet ( ii ) consistent with @xmath132 .",
    "( for example , this is how kolmogorov s words are interpreted by coquand @xcite . )",
    "if ( i ) is to be interpreted as unsolvability of some problem @xmath74 , then @xmath74 would have to be the problem of deriving the existence of the well - ordering of the continuum from the axioms of @xmath132 ; a solution of @xmath74 would be such a derivation , and the proof of the unsolvability of @xmath74 would be , naturally , in the meta - theory of @xmath132 .",
    "but then @xmath75 was solved by cohen , too : assuming such a derivation , he did get a contradiction ( by a method whose correctness is verified , naturally , in the meta - theory of @xmath132 ) .",
    "of course , in view of ( ii ) , we would not get a contradiction merely from constructing ( using tools exceeding those available in @xmath132 ) a model of @xmath132 and a well - ordering of the continuum in this model .",
    "but this means only that @xmath133 has no solution , where @xmath87 is an entirely different problem , which was solved by gdel : construct a well - ordering of the continuum in some model of @xmath132 .",
    "thus it is possible that kolmogorov might have simply conflated @xmath74 and @xmath87 , thinking of a single informal problem , `` find a well - ordering of the continuum '' .    on the other hand , kolmogorov s wording ( `` @xmath75 implies the _ unsolvability _ of @xmath74 '' ; `` the _ existence _ of such a well - ordering leads to a contradiction '' ) certainly conflates implications between problems with implications between propositions ; this makes us suspect that in writing of what must have been the former , he might have actually been thinking of the latter ( in this particular remark about the well - ordering of the continuum ) . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath134 is the proposition _ the continuum is well - orderable _",
    ", then the _ unsolvability _ of the problem of proving it , or @xmath135 in the above notation , certainly does not imply @xmath136 , the proposition that the _ existence _ of a well - ordering of the continuum leads to a contradiction . in this connection ,",
    "let us also not forget kolmogorov s initial rejection of the explosion principle @xmath137 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that heyting , while using kolmogorov s terminology ( and being informed of kolmogorov s remark quoted above ) has explicitly identified @xmath75 with @xmath127 , in his comment on the axiom scheme @xmath138 @xcite :    two more precautions on interpreting the bhk interpretation :    * the domain @xmath64 must be a `` simple domain '' such as the set @xmath79 of natural numbers ; a subset of @xmath79 defined with aid of quantifiers would require a more elaborate version of the bhk interpretation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , martin - lf s type theory @xcite is based on extending the bhk interpretation to more general domains . *",
    "the status of all primitive problems ( i.e.  if they are considered to have a solution ) is supposed to be fixed before the logical connectives can be explained , and can not be updated as we learn the meaning of the connectives ( prawitz ; see @xcite ) .",

    "3233 and @xcite ) , let @xmath139 denote the set of solutions of the problem @xmath74 .",
    "then the bhk interpretation guarantees that :    * @xmath140 is the product @xmath141 ; * @xmath142 is the disjoint union @xmath143 ; * there is a map @xmath144 into the set of all maps ; * @xmath145 ; * @xmath146 is the disjoint union @xmath147 ; * there is a map @xmath148 into the product .",
    "if we force @xmath149 to be the identity map , we obtain what might be called the `` classical bhk '' .",

    "note that we get the same result as long as @xmath149 is surjective .",
    "thus the bhk interpretation alone fails to capture the essence of intuitionistic logic .",
    "the way to deal with this issue in the intuitionistic tradition has been , unfortunately , just to sweep it under the carpet .",
    "thus , elsewhere in the same book by troelstra and van dalen @xcite , we find an analysis of `` the principle of excluded middle '' ( or rather , in our terminology , of the principle of decidability ) essentially repeating heyting s one ( in @xcite ) , including a characteristic puzzling appeal to the empirical fact that we do nt yet know whether there are infinitely many twin primes , with a striking conclusion : `` thus we can not accept [ the principle of excluded middle ] as a universally valid principle on the bhk - interpretation .

    "( other intuitionistic literature known to the present author does not seem to be more helpful on this issue , as it traditionally tends to back the apparently mathematical point by apparently philosophical considerations . )",
    "if we return for the moment to classical logic , the law of excluded middle is perhaps most clearly expressed as @xmath151 if we want to emphasize it _ as a universally valid principle_. here the quantification is over all propositions @xmath56 , such as `` @xmath152 '' , `` the sum of the angles of every triangle is @xmath153 '' , and perhaps even `` all ravens are black '' ; and the meaning of the expression @xmath154 is , in accordance with tarski s semantics for @xmath67 , that @xmath155 is true for all propositions @xmath56 . of course , there is no hope of making this quantification formal ; so some literature , including @xcite , just ignores it , whereas other literature , including @xcite , has this written instead : @xmath156 the modern reading of the latter expression is that it represents the _ judgement _ that the schema @xmath157 is derivable from the axiom schemata of classical logic ( in fact , it is often taken as one of the axiom schemata ) .",
    "here @xmath14 denotes an arbitrary formula in the language of , say , first - order logic , so @xmath157 is strictly speaking not a single formula but an infinite scheme of formulas ; and classical logic is implicit in the sign @xmath85 , whose more detailed version would be @xmath158 .",
    "if we now fix a model @xmath159 of classical logic  for instance , consisting of all propositions about natural numbers ( such as @xmath160 and @xmath152 )  then the law of excluded middle should hold in @xmath159 , in particular . in symbols , @xmath161 the meaning of this expression ( where @xmath159 is implicit in the sign @xmath162 , whose more detailed version would be @xmath163 ) is that it represents the judgement that for every proposition @xmath56 about natural numbers , @xmath155 holds .",

    "on the other hand , classical logic is complete with respect to some euler model with countable domain @xcite*viii.3.3 but of course not with respect to any two - valued model  not even in the propositional case .",
    "also , a formula @xmath510 is _ satisfiable _ in a two - valued model @xmath159 ( that is , becomes valid in @xmath159 under some assignment of variables ) if and only if @xmath511 is satisfiable in @xmath159 ; of course , this strange property does not hold in euler models .",
    "nevertheless , euler models such that @xmath528 for some @xmath529 can be derived from two - valued models , by introducing @xmath529 implicit parameters .",
    "thus we fix a domain @xmath64 , and to interpret an @xmath195-ary predicate variable @xmath458 in an euler model @xmath520 with @xmath528 we look at the interpretation of the @xmath530-ary predicate variable @xmath531 in a two - valued model @xmath159 with the same domain @xmath64 , and set @xmath532    by the deduction theorem , either in classical or intuitionistic logic , @xmath533 is equivalent to @xmath534 as long as @xmath251 has no parameters .",
    "however , already in an euler model @xmath520 of classical logic , @xmath535 need not be equivalent to @xmath536 where @xmath537 , and @xmath538 has no parameters .",

    "the clarified bhk interpretation as presented in  [ clarified ] is an informal interpretation of only the `` formulaic '' aspect of intuitionistic logic . in particular",
    ", it gives an interpretation of @xmath557 and of admissible rules , `` @xmath558 imply @xmath559 '' .",
    "in fact , it is the latter that kolmogorov presents as his interpretation of a version of heyting s inference rules ( except that he treats them as problems and not judgements ) @xcite .    to extend this interpretation to the `` inferential '' conception of intuitionistic logic",
    ", we also need an interpretation of syntactic consequence , @xmath560 .    as a preliminary step ,",
    "let us first reformulate the clarified bhk interpretation so that when instantiating the metavariables @xmath175 of the given schema @xmath176 by particular problems @xmath561 , we allow the @xmath561 to depend on additional parameters ( apart from those specified explicitly in the schema ) , provided that the resulting problem @xmath177 retains each occurrence of each additional parameter as a parameter ( i.e.  it is not bound by any quantifier ) .",
    "such an instantiation is similar to the instantiation in the sense of  [ instances ] ; to distinguish it from direct instantiation as used in  [ clarified ] , we will call it _ instantiation with anonymous parameters _ ( the parameters being `` anonymous '' in the sense of kleene @xcite*34 ) . as discussed in  [ clarified ] , to interpret the resulting problem @xmath177 according to the bhk clauses , we first replace it by its parameterless universally quantified closure ( now quantified over both explicit and anonymous parameters ) , which we will now denote @xmath562 $ ] .",
    "for example , the schema @xmath167 can now be instantiated not only by parameterless problems of the form @xmath76 , but also by the parametric problem @xmath563 , say , where @xmath564 asks to trisect any _ given _",
    "angle @xmath53 , rather than some particular fixed angle . as already observed in  [ pem ] , this comes at no loss of generality ; for if we have a general method of solving all problems of the form @xmath76 , then it applies , in particular , to all our instantiated problems @xmath565 , and thus constitutes a general method of solving the latter for each @xmath566  that is , a solution of @xmath567 $ ] .",
    "we are now ready to present what we call the _ extended bhk interpretation _ of intuitionistic logic ( in the inferential conception ) .",

    "what it means to be a solution of the resulting problem @xmath572\\to uc[\\dots]$ ] is , of course , determined by the usual bhk interpretation ( see  [ bhk ] ) .",

    "what it means for the resulting proposition @xmath572\\to uc[\\dots]$ ] to be true is , of course , determined by the usual truth tables ( see  [ tarski truth ] ) . to fix a name , we will call this simply the _ extended interpretation _ of classical logic ( in the inferential conception ) .",
    "let us note that this informal interpretation of the classical syntactic consequence relation is , in fact , closely related to its formal interpretation by the semantic consequence relation in euler models .",
    "indeed , as discussed in  [ euler ] , the anonymous parameters amount essentially to the ground set of an euler model .",
    "let us also note that there is a straightforward generalization of the extended interpretation of classical logic to the modal logic qs4 ( see  [ s4 ] ) , which is similarly compatible with topological models of qs4 .",
    "thus it can be said that the extended interpretation provides a satisfactory `` explanation '' not only of the generalization rule of classical logic , but also of the necessitation rule of qs4 .      the informal judgement _ for every particular proposition @xmath56",
    ", the proposition @xmath155 is true _ contains quantification over _ all _ propositions , which might sound weird ; however , it essentially amounts to a double quantification in more familiar terms : first over all models of classical logic , and then over all propositions within a model .",
    "in contrast , _ there exists a general method of solving the problem @xmath76 for every particular problem @xmath74 _ contains _ constructive _ quantification over all problems , which does not seem to be compatible with usual model theory .",
    "( presumably , this is one reason for the difficulties with explaining @xmath85 in the literature that deals with the bhk interpretation . )",
    "the `` modified bhk interpretation '' overcomes this difficulty by replacing this unbounded constructive quantification with a usual unbounded quantification plus a bounded constructive quantification .",
    "related ideas are also found in @xcite*definition 4.2 ( see also @xcite*ch .  7 ) .",
    "given schemata @xmath568 , @xmath569 , in the metavariables @xmath175 , the _ modified bhk interpretation _",

    "( strictly speaking , we should have allowed multi - parameter problems @xmath581 , but since we put no restrictions on the ranges of the parameters , the tuple of parameters boils down to a single vector parameter @xmath582 . ) let us note that the arguments of  [ pem ] and  [ medvedev - skvortsov ] still work to show that @xmath583 under this modified bhk interpretation .    it should be noted that unless we are content with a computational interpretation of general methods as algorithms ( as in  [ pem ] ) , the anonymous parameters would typically range over uncountable domains ( as in  [ medvedev - skvortsov ] ) , which may well be thought of as topological spaces ( compare  [ topology ] and  [ sheaves ] ) .",
    "of course , problems with continuous parameters abound in mathematical practice : for instance , to find a root of a parametric algebraic equation ( see example [ equations ] ) , or to find a solution of an initial value problem ( where either the initial value or some coefficient of the equation is treated as a parameter ) . on the other hand , the explicit parameters of the schemata @xmath568 are normally understood in first - order logic to range over the domain of discourse , which is traditionally thought of as countable ( and `` discrete '' ) .",
    "while this issue is entirely informal , it deserves to be taken into account when dealing with the ( anyway informal ) modified bhk interpretation .",
    "an advantage of the modified bhk interpretation is its still better compatibility with the spirit of classical mathematics ; a disadvantage is its notable divergence from kolmogorov s conception of intuitionistic logic as _ the logic of problem solving schemes _ , which is certainly better captured by the clarified / extended bhk interpretation .",
    "our next goal is to naturally arrive at tarski s topological models of intuitionistic logic by means of a symbolic analysis of the bhk interpretation .      given a problem @xmath74 , let @xmath125 denote , as in  [ about - bhk ] , the proposition _ a solution of @xmath74 exists_. in the notation of  [ confusion ] , @xmath125 can be also expressed as @xmath584 , where @xmath139 denotes the set of solutions of @xmath74 .",
    "validity of propositions of the form @xmath125 is understood to be determined , at least to some extent , by the bhk interpretation ( in particular , it should be known from context for primitive @xmath74 )",
    ". then the bhk entails , in particular , the following judgements , which involve both intuitionistic and classical connectives :    1 .",
    "@xmath585 if and only if @xmath586 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath587 if and only if @xmath588 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath589 implies @xmath590 ; 4 .",
    "@xmath591 ; 5 .",
    "@xmath592 if and only if @xmath593 ; 6 .",
    "@xmath594 implies @xmath595 .",
    "7 .   @xmath596 .",
    "judgements ( 1)(6 ) are perhaps best understood as immediate consequences of the six assertions in  [ confusion ] , which were in turn obtained directly from the bhk interpretation .",
    "for instance , from @xmath597 we immediately obtain ( 2 ) , since @xmath598 if and only if @xmath599 . on the other hand , since @xmath600 by definition , judgement ( 7 ) can be considered as a special case of either @xmath601 or @xmath602 .",
    "both are clearly true on the bhk interpretation : ( i ) given a solution of @xmath74 , by doing nothing to it we get a solution of @xmath74 , which is a general method  hence a solution of @xmath603 ; ( ii ) @xmath604 was already discussed in ",
    "[ tautologies ] , ( [ explosion0 ] ) .    given a formula @xmath251 with @xmath195 parameters , which is understood to belong to intuitionistic logic and thus to denote a problem of the form @xmath605",
    ", we may introduce an @xmath195-ary predicate variable @xmath606 , to be treated as an object of classical logic , which is understood to denote propositions of the form @xmath607 .",
    "then the assertions in the above list can be seen , just like in  [ clarified ] , as informal interpretations of the following judgements about schemata :    1 .",

    "@xmath614 .",
    "the schemata to the right of the @xmath85 symbols can be understood as axiom schemes of a first - order theory @xmath615 based on classical logic .",

    "let us then see if we can get something interesting under somewhat stronger hypotheses  not entirely covered by the bhk interpretation .",

    "finally , if we understand the open set @xmath616 as an interpretation of the `` problem '' @xmath251 ( and not just of the `` proposition '' @xmath606 ) , we will get a model of intuitionistic logic .",

    "let @xmath1290 .",
    "then @xmath1291 , so @xmath1292 , which has no global sections . on the other hand",
    ", each @xmath1293 has a global section , hence so does their product .",
    "thus there exist no sheaf morphisms @xmath1294 .",
    "we need to construct a morphism of presheaves @xmath1295 , where @xmath132 is of the form @xmath1296 . given an open set @xmath636 and a collection @xmath1297 of sections @xmath1298 , we consider two cases .",
    "if none of the @xmath1015 actually belongs to @xmath871 , then we send @xmath54 via the inclusion @xmath1299 .",
    "if some @xmath1015 belongs to @xmath871 , we send @xmath54 to the image of this @xmath1015 under the inclusion @xmath1300 .",
    "since @xmath1301 is the characteristic presheaf of some open set ( in fact , a regular one ) , @xmath871 contains at most one element , so the choice of @xmath294 is irrelevant .",
    "this construction is clearly natural in @xmath636 .      in sheaf - valued models ,",
    "every formula interpreted by the characteristic sheaf of a clopen set is decidable .",
    "hence the disjunction property fails if @xmath0 is disconnected ; and the rule of omniscience can be refuted similarly to  [ markov ] .    to prove that the disjunction property holds in presheaf - valued models it suffices to note that @xmath1302 has a global section if and only if one of the presheaves @xmath132 , @xmath83 has a global section .",
    "in particular , if @xmath170 is a formula that is decidable in the model , then either @xmath629 has a global section or @xmath1296 has a global section ; the latter amounts to saying that @xmath1303",

    "thus @xmath1308 is decidable in the model as long as each @xmath1309 is .",
    "it is clear from the proofs of [ global2 ] and [ global3 ] that when the space @xmath0 is connected , sheaf - valued models also satisfy the negative constant domain principle and the disjunction property  in contrast to tarski models .    as a cheap trick to construct sheaf - type models that do not satisfy the disjunction property over a connected space @xmath0",

    "however , this fails to yield a model of intuitionistic logic , since by proposition [ tarski forall fails ] , @xmath1311 will not be equivalent to @xmath1312 .",

    "uniform sheaf structure _ , we repeat the definition of a sheaf - valued structure with just two amendments ( see @xcite or @xcite concerning uniform spaces ) :    * @xmath0 is not just a topological space but a uniform space ; * @xmath630 means that there exists a uniform cover @xmath1316 of @xmath0 such that @xmath1313 has a section over each @xmath1317 for each valuation @xmath464 .    [ uniformity ] for example , let us consider the usual uniformity on @xmath1318 , induced by the euclidean metric on @xmath78 , and the sheaf @xmath1319 .",
    "its support is the entire @xmath1320 , but since @xmath1321 as @xmath1322 , there exists no uniform cover @xmath899 such that @xmath831 has a section over each @xmath1040 .",
    "part ( a ) can be proved similarly to ( b ) , and in fact follows from ( b ) when @xmath0 is a metrizable space , since in this case uniform ( pre)sheaf models include local ( pre)sheaf models by considering the fine uniformity , that is , the finest uniform structure that induces the given topology . for metrizable spaces ,",
    "the uniform covers of the fine uniformity are precisely those covers that can be refined by open covers .",
    "if @xmath37 is an primary law of intuitionistic logic , by theorem [ global1 ] @xmath37 is satisfied in sheaf - valued structures .",
    "then a fortiori @xmath37 is satisfied in uniform structures .",
    "so it suffices to check the satisfaction of the inference rules .    for the modus ponens rule ,",
