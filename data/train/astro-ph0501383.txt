    "the central region of the galaxy is our closest opportunity to quantify the structure and formation of a dense and massive complex stellar - dynamical system .",
    "a detailed star - by - star analysis is possible in the milky way bulge , in contrast to distant galaxies where only the integrated light is observed .",
    "but our point of view from within the galactic disc has its drawbacks .",
    "the high interstellar extinction , the crowding and the confusion between foreground disc stars and bulge sources , make studies of the inner galactic regions difficult .    there is substantial evidence for the presence of a triaxial structure in the inner galaxy .",
    "the presence of a bar was first suggested from the observations of non - circular motions in the gas kinematics by @xcite .",
    "the first direct evidence came from detection of an asymmetry in the infrared luminosity distribution ( @xcite ) , confirmed by the cobe map ( @xcite ) .",
    "star counts confirmed the presence of an asymmetry in their luminosity distribution , from iras sources ( @xcite , @xcite ) , near - infrared star surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and optical ( ogle ) surveys of red clump stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new near - infrared surveys denis and 2mass , with arcsecond spatial resolution and sufficient sensitivity to detect typical red giant bulge sources , complemented by the mid - infrared iso survey isogal , are beginning to provide new constraints ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the high optical depth measured by the microlensing surveys also points towards a non - axisymmetric model , but the exact constraints remain controversial ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "only a few dynamical constraints are available so far , essentially from stellar kinematics from sio masers ( @xcite ) , oh / ir stars ( @xcite ) , and from observations through a few low - extinction windows ( @xcite ) . early dynamical models of gas hi , co and cs emissions ( @xcite ) and infrared luminosity distribution models ( @xcite , @xcite ) were derived independently , while more recently new models are being developed to incorporate both gas and luminosity constraints , using in particular n - body simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "all those studies agree that the inner galaxy at low latitudes is asymmetric , with the bulge / bar major axis at positive galactic longitudes .",
    "the exact orientation , length and axis ratio of the inner asymmetric structure are still poorly constrained ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relative importances of the bulge and the inner disk in the central regions , the stellar population content , and the formation and evolutionary history remain unknown ( @xcite ) .",
    "discussion continues on the need for a distinction between a central bulge and a long thin bar ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , along the line of sight towards the central regions of the galaxy one crosses the galactic disc , spiral arms , the molecular ring , the bar and/or bulge , and maybe other complex structures such as a hole in the disc distribution , or a possible stellar ring or double bar , as observed in external galaxies . to improve our understanding of this crucial region new high sensitivity and high spatial resolution multi - wavelength studies",
    "are needed .",
    "in this paper we present new deep near - infrared photometry of the inner galaxy close to the galactic plane , taken with the cambridge infrared survey instrument ( cirsi ) . those observations provide large samples of bulge / bar red clump stars , allowing extinction mapping and reliable 3-d spatial analyses in fields at both positive and negative galactic longitudes in the galactic plane .",
    "the requirements for an observational study of inner galactic structure are well - established , following earlier studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . near infrared observations",
    "are optimal , to identify the dominant intrinsically - bright red giant stellar population , while minimising the effects of interstellar extinction ( longer wavelength mid - infrared studies , such as those for isogal , are optimised for study of the latest m giants ) .",
    "observations of the inner galaxy preferably in the galactic plane , and certainly at low galactic latitudes , are desirable to minimise model - dependent corrections for the as - yet poorly known scale heights of the inner - galactic stellar populations . to study the expected asymmetry caused by the galactic bar , observations at both positive and negative longitudes are essential , with , in so far as is possible given the extinction distribution , symmetric longitude fields preferred .",
    "@xcite have shown that structural studies at absolute galactic longitudes greater than 4 degrees are needed to constrain bar models to a useful extent .",
    "given these requirements , we selected for further detailed study fields observed by denis and isogal at galactic latitudes @xmath3 and galactic longitudes @xmath4 , where the effect of any bar - like feature should be strong , and at @xmath1=@xmath5 where the bar may or may not be present . the field c32 ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) , which was used as an isogal calibration field because of its low and uniform extinction ( @xcite ) , was also selected for calibration purposes here , and in addition to provide the minor - axis reference to set the zero - point of the expected asymmetry .    near - infrared observations in the j(1.25@xmath8 m ) , h(1.65@xmath8 m ) and k@xmath9(2.15@xmath8 m )",

    "the pixel scale is 0.2 arcsec pixel@xmath10 .",
    "the gaps between the detectors being comparable to the detector size , four dither sets are used to create a fully - observed mosaic image , leading to a basic field of view of about 13 x 13 arcmin@xmath11 .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     we studied the robustness of our results against different choices of isochrones . a different age changes the absolute magnitude of the red clump but not its colour ,",
    "so as we fix @xmath12 from our data the choice of age does not affect our results .",
    "however metallicity and enrichment in @xmath13-elements does affect the colours . a change in [ fe / h ] of 0.4 dex changes @xmath14 by about 0.08 mag , the higher the metallicity the redder the colour .",
    "isochrones for @xmath13-enhanced stars lead to @xmath14 bluer by about 0.1 mag .",
    "however as all is calibrated on field c32 , the resulting distance estimates do not change by more than 0.3 kpc . however we note that the three different distance modulus estimates for field c32 ( bottom of figure [ histomod ] ) agree much better with @xmath13-enhanced isochrones ( within 0.01 mag ) than with the basic set ( where the dispersion is 0.1 mag ) . on the other hand , for all the other fields the @xmath13-enhanced isochrones lead to a larger dispersion .",
    "if we assume that we are not probing one but two different stellar populations , which would correspond to the bulge for field c32 and to a distinct galactic bar for the other fields , such a difference would be expected . chosing the @xmath13-enhanced colors for the bulge field ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the basic set for all the others would lead to an increase in distance modulus in all the ` bar ' fields of about 0.1 mag .",
    "if we also consider an age difference , using an age of 6 gyr ( @xcite ) for the bar fields would also add about 0.1 mag to the distance modulus .",
    "figure [ popsdiff ] illustrates the effect of systematics in the assumed stellar populations : if we assume that the inner bulge is formed of an old population with enhanced @xmath13 abundances , while the bar is formed of a younger population with solar abundances , the deduced distances show a much smaller dispersion from a galactic bar simple linear regression model . if confirmed by spectral observations , this implies a bar population which is formed from the inner disc , and not from the old bulge .",

    "the mean distances down each line of sight , the range of distances corresponding to the deconvolved one-@xmath19 dispersion in distance modulus is also illustrated . in spite of this representation ,",
    "we emphasise that the true distribution in distance has no reason to be gaussian , as it is linked to the geometry of the bar / bulge and to our viewing angle .",
    "our observation angle biases both our distance and dispersion estimates , because of the larger volume , and hence probable larger number of stars present in the far side of our observation cone than in the near side .",
    "one should then keep in mind that our distance estimates will be slightly biased towards larger distances , especially for structures with a large true dispersion in distances , and as close to us as is observed at @xmath1=+9 .",
    "our mean red clump distances measured at @xmath20 and @xmath21 are consistent with the more recent bar models , particularly those derived considering both gas dynamics and available surface brightness luminosity distributions .",
    "those models deduce a bar orientation with respect to the sun -galactic centre direction of 15@xmath22 35(e.g .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the model of @xcite ( their figure 11 ) is overlaid on figure [ barmod ] .",
    "this model assumes a bar with an angle @xmath23 , a length of 3.5  kpc and an axis ratio 10:3 - 4 .",
    "the overall agreement with our direct distance determinations is rather good .",
    "our mean red clump distance derived at @xmath24 is however not simply consistent with the bar model described above .",
    "a single linear fit to all the four mean distances measured at @xmath25 has all four points more than 3@xmath19 from the ` best fit ' .",
    "however the feature observed at @xmath24 does seem real : inspection of figure [ mkjk ] shows a clear overdensity of the whole red giant branch at the same distance as the mean clump distance , determined to be @xmath26 9  kpc , in this field .",
    "moreover , in this line of sight , the most likely source of distance bias , the presence of disc red clump stars , would bias the distance estimate towards larger distances , not shorter .",
    "the red clump distance estimate at @xmath24 is consistent with that at @xmath21 .",
    "a possible physical interpretation is that we have detected the signature of the end of the bar .",
    "star count peaks have also been detected in this region in studies of old oh / ir stars by @xcite and in the denis star counts by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that this local density maximum may be related to the red clump overdensity detected by @xcite at @xmath27 .",
    "the @xcite density maximum is indicated in figure [ barmod ] by a square .",
    "the presence of these two local features at @xmath27 and @xmath24 and their mean red clump distance estimates could imply the presence of a double triaxiality in the inner galaxy , a double bar , or a triaxial bulge oriented at @xmath28 with a longer , thiner bar oriented at @xmath29 . however ,",
    "if such a second structure did exist , we should have detected its signature in our other survey fields .",
    "no such complex signature is evident ( cf . figure [ mkjk ] ) .",
    "if two complex spatial distributions were projected down our lines of sight without being resolved , this would imply that our distance determinations are biased so that the angle of the first structure is in fact smaller than the 22  we measured , and that the spread of the red clump distances observed down each line of sight would encompass both structures .",
    "the latter does not seem to correspond to the rather small distance dispersions we derived , which are summarised in table [ distances ] .",
    "furthermore , @xcite do not detect a density excess at l=+21 , confirming that the structure seen at l=+27@xmath30 is probably local , and unrelated to the larger bulge or bar .",
    "an alternative , and perhaps more consistent , interpretation of the @xmath24 structure we observe is the presence of a stellar ring or pseudo - ring at the end of the galactic bar .",
    "if so , the bar and the stellar ring would have a radius of 2.3@xmath00.25  kpc .",
    "our observations at @xmath20 indicate that the radius of the bar is at least 2.7@xmath00.2  kpc long .",
    "those two determinations are consistent within one@xmath16 .",
    "we note that assuming the bulge / bar stellar population differences used for figure [ popsdiff ] leads to a larger bar radius of about 3 kpc .",
    "a bar radius of about 2.5  kpc would agree with the model of @xcite and @xcite , but is smaller than the value indicated by @xcite in his review .",
    "the presence of a ring has been suspected by several authors . a molecular ring at about 4 - 5  kpc is a well known feature deduced from co maps . our detection of a step increase in the extinction distribution in field 9p ( indicated by a cross in figure [ barmod ] )",
    "could be associated with this molecular ring .",
    "@xcite link their derived distribution of ultracompact hii regions to the molecular ring , but also detect a star forming ring at about 2  kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "a stellar ring was suspected to lie at 3.5  kpc from the galactic centre by @xcite . from an oh / ir star study",
    "@xcite suggests that an inner ring lies between between 2.2 and 3.5  kpc . from star counts in the denis survey",
    "@xcite also argue for the presence of a stellar ring , mainly from the detection of a density peak at @xmath31 that , following @xcite , they associate with the tangential point to the 3-kpc arm , which is likely to be a ( pseudo-)ring . the presence of a galactic ring would also help to reproduce the observed microlensing optical depth ( @xcite ) .",
    "inner ring structures are indeed frequently observed in barred spirals .",
    "most inner rings are in fact pseudo - rings , formed from the complex merging of inner bars and spiral structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a pseudo - ring structure is consistent with all the various detections of sub - structures between 2 and 4  kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "@xcite detect an asymmetry in the galactic plane extinction distribution , with more extinction at negative than at positive longitudes .",
    "we do not confirm this result .",
    "the fact that we do not find any asymmetry in red clump giant extinction between positive and negative longitudes ( figure [ mkjk ] ) , while there is an asymmetry in distance , is certainly consistent with a minimum in the dust distribution in this region .",
    "interior of the bar outer radius a lower global density of stars and gas is often seen in observations of other galaxies .",
    "several authors have suggested that such a stellar density decrease may be present in the galactic disc ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our observations are consistent with such a decrease in the dust distribution of the inner disc .",
    "another interesting feature often observed in barred galaxies is the presence of dust lanes associated with the bar . from dirbe surface brightness maps",
    ", @xcite suggested the presence of such a dust lane , preceding the galactic bar .",
    "they estimate the extra absorption present at negative longitudes to be between 1 and 2.6 mag in k. the presence of such a feature is clearly ruled out by our observations .      ) .",
    "this figure is derived from h&k@xmath9 photometry , which have the faintest completeness limits for this field.,width=317 ]    the reddening - independent colour - magnitude diagram for the lines of sight towards @xmath32 ( figure [ kehk ] ) differ significantly from those in other directions , in that the red clump stars indicate a very considerable range of distances , with no clear local maximum density .",
    "this is also very apparent in the relevant panels of figure [ histomod ] , which show the corresponding distribution in distance modulus .",
    "the broad apparent distance distribution observed for the red clump stars at @xmath32 could be explained by the presence of two features , one at @xmath26 6  kpc and a second at @xmath26 11  kpc .",
    "indeed , careful inspection of figure [ kehk ] suggests that the clump at @xmath33 does not extend redder than h - k@xmath9@xmath341.2 , while the fainter part , corresponding to distances greater than @xmath35kpc , extends beyond the photometric completeness limit .",
    "the first distance range is consistent with the bar structure confirmed above .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that the ogle data of @xcite , observed at a lower latitude of b=@xmath36 , show similar photometric behaviour at @xmath32 compared to @xmath21 , except for the expected shift in distance modulus .    the fainter feature in our low - latitude data could then be due to another structure , further away .",
    "this feature could be due to disc red clump stars . indeed with increasing distance",
    "both the volume observed and the extinction increase , and considering the logarithmic relation between distance and magnitude , any distant red clump stars visible would concentrate in the high - extinction high distance - modulus bottom - right part of the cmd .",
    "deeper data than we have available are then needed to determine if we are indeed seeing the distant disk beyond the bulge or a local structure which could be associated with the ring .",
    "this region is also interesting for further study as a broad velocity - width molecular clump has been detected at @xmath37 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which may be a manifestation of gas shocks ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an estimate of the distance of those two structures , if the fainter one is real and indeed a local maximum , is presented in figure [ barmod ] as the open circles .",
    "we have obtained , reduced and analysed deep wide - field near - infrared photometry of five lines of sight towards the galactic bulge within 0.25  of the galactic plane , using the cirsi camera .",
    "this has provided a substantial improvement in our quantitative knowledge of inner galactic structure , and in particular of the structure of the galactic bar .",
    "our use of near - infrared data allows us to determine reddening - independent magnitudes and to observe bulge red clump stars within the galactic plane , where the extinction is too high for optical studies .",
    "this allows the detection of tracer stellar populations independently of their scale height .",
    "colour - reddening - independent magnitude diagrams have been shown to disentangle the effects of distance and extinction , allowing a direct conversion of red - clump star photometry ( @xmath38,@xmath39 ) into an ( @xmath40,distance ) estimate .",
    "those determinations have led to the following main results :    1 .",
    "the presence of a triaxial structure at the centre of our galaxy is confirmed .",
    "its angle relative to the sun - galactic centre line is @xmath41 .",
    "it extends to at least 2.5  kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "a large axis ratio is excluded , but our data are consistent with a 10:3 - 4 ratio . in particular the distance dispersion of the bulge along the ( @xmath420,b=1 ) line of sight is less than 1  kpc .",
    "a structure present at @xmath43 is not aligned with this triaxiality .",
    "we suggest that the structure present at @xmath43 is likely to be the signature of the end of the galactic bar , which is therefore circumscribed by an inner pseudo - ring .",
    "a decrease in the dust distribution inside the bar radius is inferred from the extinction distribution in our fields .",
    "4 .   our observations are not consistent with the existence of the dust lane preceding the galactic bar at negative longitudes suggested by @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to jacco van loon and robert sharp for their participation in the cirsi observations , and to the cirsi team for building the camera .",
    "the development and construction of cirsi was made possible by a generous grant from the raymond and beverly sackler foundation .",
