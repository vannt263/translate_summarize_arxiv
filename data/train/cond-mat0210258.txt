    "experimental realization of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in trapped alkali atoms triggered feverish activity in cold atom physics @xcite .",
    "recent development of experimental techniques in trapping and cooling of dilute atomic gases allows for preparation , manipulation and control of a condensate in various states and various trapping potentials .",
    "for instance , excitation of a condensate to vortex and solitonic states became possible @xcite .",
    "cold atoms are also becoming a convenient toy system to study solid state physics .",
    "for example , cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice potential undergo quantum phase transition to mott insulator phase when the barrier between minima of the lattice potential is increased @xcite .    theoretical description of a many body system is a challenge to physicists . at low temperature our understanding of bec",
    "is usually based on a mean field approximation within the gross - pitaievskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "gpe provides satisfactory experimental predictions when depletion of a condensate , induced by interactions between atoms , is negligible . in order to describe these quantum fluctuations around the condensate in a systematic way one can use the bogoliubov theory of bec .",
    "the key idea of the original bogoliubov theory @xcite is the @xmath0 symmetry breaking approach where the atomic field operator is assumed to have a nonzero expectation value . this _ coherent _ state necessarily involves superposition of states with different numbers of atoms , an assumption very far from experimental reality .",
    "a number - conserving bogoliubov theory has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "while taking into account a finite number of atoms in a condensate , this theory represents eigenstates of the bogoliubov hamiltonian as fock states with well defined numbers of bogoliubov quasiparticles in all bogoliubov modes . in this",
    "_ quasiparticle _ representation it is possible , and even pleasant , to calculate a single particle density matrix .",
    "however , higher order correlators are increasingly more painfull to get . for all practical purposes in the quasiparticle representation",
    "the multiparticle correlations remain hidden .",
    "the single particle density function carries very limited information about a many - body system , as is best illustrated by an example considered by javanainen and yoo @xcite .",
    "they simulated a measurement of atom density distribution in an atomic fock state @xmath1 ( it is a model counterpart of an experiment with interference of two separate becs @xcite ) . with two counter - propagating plane waves as the two modes in the fock state the single particle density function gives uniform density distribution .",
    "however , sampling of the many - body probability density shows that each realization of the experiment reveals an interference pattern . only after averaging over many realizations",
    "one gets the uniform density distribution predicted from the single particle density function .",
    "it seems thus crucial to understand the structure of a condensate multiparticle wavefunction especially when the number of non - condensed atoms becomes considerable and may play a significant role in an outcome of a measurement . in this paper",
    "we derive an expression for bogoliubov eigenstates in _ particle _ representation i.e. as superpositions over fock states with well defined numbers of _ particles _ ( atoms ) in a condensate and non - condensate single particle states .",
    "for example , the state without any quasiparticles ( bogoliubov vacuum ) has a pair - correlated form @xmath2 where the index @xmath3 runs over a basis of modes @xmath4 orthogonal to the condensate wavefunction @xmath5 .",
    "this pair - correlated ansatz has been proposed in a review by leggett @xcite , but ( except for a homogeneous condensate @xcite ) the eigenvalues @xmath6 and the eigenmodes @xmath7 remain unknown . in this paper",
    "we construct a simple relationship between these eigenmodes / eigenvalues and the elementary bogoliubov excitations of the system for a general inhomogeneous condensate which is of current experimental interest .",
    "the pair correlated vacuum state is a foundation on which one can build the theory of bec entirely in terms of @xmath8-particle wavefunctions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ bogcast ]",
    "we briefly summarize the number - conserving bogoliubov theory introduced by castin and dum @xcite for a system with a finite number of particles . in section  [ stanz ]",
    "we derive the particle representation of the bogoliubov eigenstates . in sections  [ 2w],[3w],[becharm ]",
    "we illustrate the particle representation with a series of examples : a double well , a triple well , and a condensate in a harmonic potential . we conclude in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the original bogoliubov theory ( bt ) @xcite was build around the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking : the field annihilation operator @xmath9 acquires a large nonzero expectation value , @xmath10 .",
    "this nonzero mean is sometimes regarded as a symptom of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the original bt is build by expansion in small quantum fluctuations around this large mean , @xmath11 .",
    "this method has to be used with a lot of care .",
    "for example , careful application of the bt leads to the divergence of the quantum fluctuations that is interpreted as a quantum phase spreading of the condensate @xcite . in the original spontaneous symmetry breaking approach",
    "the condensate state is not a stationary state because for @xmath12 the number of particles is not well defined and states with different numbers of atoms have different energies .",
    "a self - consistent version of the bogoliubov theory , which explicitly takes into account that there is a well defined number of atoms in a trap , was put forward in ref .",
