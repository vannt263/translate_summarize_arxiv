    "the study of molecular gas in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) can provide a window on the processes that fuel , and sometimes hide , the central engine , and can potentially aid in understanding how large scale processes such as galaxy interactions and mergers trigger nuclear activity .",
    "the general picture of agn activation that has emerged over the past decade or so involves the following events : a merger induces a concentration of mass in the galactic nucleus , in the form of dusty molecular gas ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "some fraction of this molecular material is driven down to very small scales , where it provides the fuel for the central black hole .",
    "initially , the newly energized agn is hidden by the dusty gas , but it eventually emerges ( at least along some lines of sight ) as the gas is consumed , ejected , or flattened into a disk - like configuration .",
    "along the way , a nuclear starburst may occur .",
    "absorption and re - emission of the nuclear and stellar energy sources by dust can result , at least in the early phases , in a very luminous infrared source .",
    "this sort of scenario provides a natural evolutionary link between luminous infrared galaxies and mature agns ( sanders et al 1988 ) .",
    "carbon monoxide and a limited suite of other molecules have been detected , and in few cases mapped , in a number of agns . at low redshifts",
    "these include seyfert galaxies ( sanders et al 1987 , 1989 ; heckman et al 1989 ; miexner et al 1990 ; sternberg , genzel & tacconi 1994 ; helfer & blitz 1995 ) , radio galaxies ( mirabel , sanders , & kazs 1989 ) , and low- to moderate - luminosity quasars ( sanders , scoville , & soifer 1988 ; barvainis , alloin , & antonucci 1989 ; alloin et al 1992 ; scoville et al 1993 ) . at high redshifts ( @xmath3 )",
    "there have been only three confirmed co detections , amidst a number of ( as yet ) unconfirmed reports .",
    "the confirmed high-@xmath4 co sources are the infrared galaxy / hidden quasar iras f10214 + 4724 at @xmath5 ( brown & vanden bout 1992 ; solomon et al 1992 ) , the cloverleaf quasar ( h1413 + 117 ) at @xmath6 ( barvainis et al 1994 ; wilner , zhao , & ho 1995 ) , and the quasar br1202@xmath70725 at @xmath8 ( omont et al 1996a ; ohta et al 1996 ) .",
    "it appears from these high - redshift objects , and also from molecular studies at lower redshifts , that a necessary but not sufficient condition for co detection is the presense of a strong far - infrared or millimeter / submillimeter continuum , i.e. one that is detectable either in the iras database at 60  or 100 , or by ground - based telescopes at @xmath9 mm .",
    "of these three confirmed high-@xmath4 co sources , the cloverleaf ( 4 images ; magain et al 1988 ) and iras f10214 + 4724 ( gravitational arc system ; e.g.  broadhurst & lehar 1996 ; eisenhardt et al 1996 ) are definitely gravitationally lensed , and both have iras and 1 mm continuum detections ( barvainis et al 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "br1202@xmath70725 may also be lensed , but this is uncertain at this time .",
    "the optical emission shows a single source ( a classical broad - line quasar ) , but in the 1 mm continuum and in co(@xmath10 ) line emission the source is a double with a separation of @xmath11 .",
    "the southeast mm / co source is coincident with the optical quasar , while the location of the northwest component shows no counterpart in deep optical exposures ( hu , mcmahon , & egami 1996 ) . the co spectra of the two components are rather noisy , but reveal no significant differences in line shape or velocity centroid . no direct evidence has yet been found for a lensing galaxy or cluster toward br1202@xmath70725 , but evidence of gravitational shear in the field has been reported ( see omont et al 1996a ) . either the system is lensed , with the optical part of the northwest image extincted by dust in the lensing galaxy , or else it consists of a luminous quasar with extremely luminous submillimeter and co emission and an optically weak or absorbed ( but equally mm / co strong ) companion .",
    "it would be very useful to know to what extent gravitational lensing amplification is in fact necessary for the detection and study of co and other molecules at high redshift , given current instrumental limitations .",
    "recent work suggests that lensing , while always helpful , may not be required in all cases . in the apparently unlensed radio galaxy 53w002 ( @xmath12 ) , a weak co(32 ) line has recently been reported by scoville et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "this object has not been detected as yet in the far - infrared / submillimeter continuum .",
    "guilloteau et al ( 1997 ) report a highly significant co(54 ) line at @xmath13 from the radio quiet quasar bri 1335 - 0415 , which has a 1.3 mm continuum detection ( omont et al 1996b ) but like 53w002 shows no evidence for lensing . in this letter",
    "we report a sensitive search for co emission from two high redshift systems , both of which are far - infrared / submillimeter continuum sources , but only one of which is gravitationally lensed .",
    "the observed sources are pg 1634 + 706 , a luminous radio - quiet quasar at @xmath14 , and mg 0414 + 0534 (= 4c+05.19 ) , a gravitationally lensed quasar at @xmath15 .",
    "the observations were carried out in the @xmath163 mm band using the plateau de bure interferometer of the institut de radio astronomie millimetrique over a number of sessions during 1996 and 1997 .",
    "the array consisted of 4 or @xmath17 m antennas in various configurations covering baselines from 32400 m. total observing times were 10 hours for pg 1634 + 706 and 30 hours for mg 0414 + 0534 .",
    "the total frequency bandwidth was 500 mhz , and system temperatures were typically 130 k. for mg 0414 + 0534 , which has 40 mjy of continuum flux , bandpass correction was applied using 3c454.3 , 0415 + 379 , and 0420 - 014 as the bandpass calibrators .",
    "we estimate that the bandpass correction is accurate to better than a few percent , or @xmath18 mjy , across the observed band .",
    "significant co emission was detected only in mg 0414 + 0534 .",
    "line parameters for mg 0414 + 0534 , and upper limits for pg 1634 + 706 , are summarized in table 1 .",
    "pg 1634 + 706 was detected in all four iras bands ( 12 , 25 , 60 , & 100 ) in pointed observations ( neugebauer et al 1986 ) . given its radio quiet nature ,",
    "the mid- to far - infrared continuum is very likely emission from dust ( see , e.g. , barvainis 1992 ) .",
    "the iras fluxes are similar to those of the cloverleaf at 60 and 100 , so pg 1634 + 706 seemed like an excellent candidate for study in molecular line emission . because of the narrow bandwidths available in millimeter - wavelength spectrometers , it is important to use the best possible estimate of the systemic redshift of the target .",
    "the standard catalog redshift of pg 1634 + 706 is 1.334 , based on the high - ionization broad emission lines .",
    "however , these lines can be blue - shifted relative to systemic by over 1000 in some quasars .",
    "we used instead the ( adjusted ) systemic redshift estimate given by tytler and fan ( 1992 ) of @xmath19 , to obtain an observing frequency of 98.647 ghz for the co(@xmath20 ) line ( rest frequency 230.538 ghz ) .",
    "no significant line emission was detected toward pg 1634 + 706 .",
    "it is very unlikely that the source was resolved out , since the synthesized beam was @xmath21 ( pa @xmath22 ) , or @xmath23 kpc in diameter at the source ( where @xmath24 is the hubble constant in units of 70 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 , and we have taken @xmath26 ) .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure 1 , smoothed to a velocity resolution of 152 .",
    "the rms noise per channel at this resolution is 1.3 mjy / beam ; using this we derive a @xmath27 upper limit to the line peak of 2.9 mjy and to the velocity - integrated line flux of 0.86 jy km s@xmath25 , assuming a gaussian line of full width half maximum 300 .",
    "there is a weak continuum source , with flux density @xmath28 mjy , at the position of the quasar .",
    "this is comparable to the @xmath29 mjy flat spectrum centimeter wavelength source ( antonucci & barvainis 1988 ) , showing that this component remains flat out to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "mg 0414 + 0534 resolves into four components with maximum separation @xmath30 in high resolution radio images ( a1 , a2 , b , and c ; hewitt et al 1992 ) .",
    "the combined optical spectrum between 6000  and 9400  is extremely red , with @xmath31 ( hewitt et al 1992 ) .",
    "the lensed nature of this system was confirmed by optical spectra comparing components a1+a2 and b ( angonin - willaime et al 1994 ) .",
    "lawrence et al ( 1995 , herafter lejt ) identified a strong broad h@xmath32 line from near - infrared spectroscopy and determined a redshift of @xmath33 for the lensed object ; broad h@xmath32 is known to be a good indicator of the true systemic redshift .",
    "the redshift of the lensing galaxy remains unknown .",
    "lejt argue that mg 0414 + 0534 is a typical high - redshift quasar heavily reddened by dust in the lens .",
    "they argue further that the iras detections at 25  ( @xmath34 mjy ) and 60(@xmath35 mjy ) originate in the quasar itself , rather than in the lens , for the following reasons .",
    "first , the overall dereddened sed , including the iras points , is typical of a low - redshift iras quasar .",
    "second , if the lens is a normal galaxy at an intermediate redshift ( 0.51.5 ) , it would have to have an unprecedented infrared luminosity to be detected by iras .",
    "mg 0414 + 0534 is thus very similar to the cloverleaf : a distant , lensed quasar with strong infrared emission .",
    "we searched for co(@xmath0 ) emission at a frequency of 95.025 ghz , based on the h@xmath32 redshift of lejt .",
    "mg 0414 + 0534 showed evidence for co emission after the first 8 hours of observation .",
    "the line was confirmed in 22 hours of follow - up , resulting in a secure detection of co(@xmath0 ) emission centered within 100  of the h@xmath32 redshift . the final spectrum , spatially integrated over the four centimeter - wavelength continuum components , is shown in figure 2 ( top panel ) .",
    "the lensed configuration of the centimeter radio continuum components is as follows : relative to component a1 in the 5 ghz map of hewitt et al ( 1992 ) , a2 lies at [ ra , dec ] = [ @xmath36 , b lies at [ @xmath37 , and c lies at [ @xmath38 .",
    "the relative strengths , combining a1+a2 into one component designated a , are approximately 14:3:1 for a : b : c . with a synthesized beam of @xmath39 ( pa @xmath40 ) , it is difficult to separate the components in the co(@xmath0 ) velocity - integrated map plane . however , by fitting the uv data directly we were able to resolve the combined a components from component b and obtain separate co(@xmath0 ) spectra .",
    "these are shown in figure 2 ( two lower panels ) .",
    "the line from b is weak , and looks somewhat different from the a line .",
    "the relative strength a : b in the continuum at 5 ghz is 5:1 . in our millimeter wavelength data",
    "the continuum ratio is more like 7:1 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "given the noise on the spectra , and assuming that the 7:1 ratio holds for co , the b line - shape is only marginally consistent with that of a. the only channel in the b spectrum that is very significantly different from the prediction based on a/7 is the one centered at + 63 , which is @xmath41 too high .",
    "but the channels centered at + 221  and @xmath42  are also too high , by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "to explain a difference between the a and b spectra , it is quite possible that due to proximity to a caustic the b and a images sample a different region in an extended co source , resulting in a different line shape .",
    "further progress on this point will have to await data of higher resolution and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "there is some evidence that the co source may in fact be slightly extended and displaced about @xmath45 west of the continuum source , but the size measurement is complicated by the relatively strong ( 40 mjy ) continuum source underlying the co line emission . until more sensitive observations are performed ,",
    "we quote a limit on the co source size of @xmath46 .",
    "the detection of co in mg 0414 + 0534 adds to the similarities between it and both iras f10214 + 4724 and the cloverleaf  all have weak iras detections , are gravitationally lensed , lie at redshifts near 2.5 , and have abundant molecular gas .",
    "given that detectable mid- to far - infrared flux appears to be a good ( but not infallible ) selection criterion for molecular gas , it is useful to look at the co - to - ir luminosity ratio .",
    "we define the frequency - integrated co(@xmath0 ) luminosity relative to the @xmath47 luminosity at 30  ( rest frame , or @xmath48observed frame for @xmath49 ) to be @xmath50/\\nu_e l_{\\nu_e}[30~\\mu{\\rm m}]$ ] . for mg 0414 + 0534 ,",
    "@xmath51 , which is equal to the value found for f10214 + 4724 and 2.4 times lower than that of the cloverleaf .    for a sample of seven nearby quasars and luminous seyfert 1 galaxies detected in co(@xmath52 )",
    ", this ratio spans the range @xmath53 .",
    "here we have included a factor for the line brightness temperature ratio between co(32 ) and co(10 ) .",
    "this ratio may be @xmath540.8 due to subthermal excitation or other effects , as observed in luminous infrared galaxies at low redshift ( radford , solomon , & downes 1991 ) . for the detected high redshift quasars @xmath55 , a factor of five below the local objects if the co(@xmath0 ) and co(@xmath52 ) brightness temperatures are equal .",
    "it is likely however that @xmath56 , as noted , bringing the co - to - ir ratios closer .",
    "also , the nearby sample only includes co - detected objects , which would tend to have a higher ratio than average ( to our knowledge no complete co survey of nearby iras - detected objects has been done ) .",
    "parenthetically , the co - to - ir ratio could be affected by lensing : if the co and infrared sources are not the same size , they might be magnified by different factors .    because of its iras detections , pg 1634 + 706 seemed like a good candidate for co emission . for this quasar @xmath57 , which is below the lowest values for the detected objects noted above . since pg 1634 + 706",
    "is the only unlensed radio quiet quasar detected by iras at high redshift , it is anomalously infrared - luminous , and this may be related to the low co - to - ir ratio .",
    "sanders , scoville , & soifer ( 1991 ) note that among nearby luminous iras galaxies , the highest luminosity galaxies have the lowest co - to - ir ratios ( or , in their formulation , the highest @xmath58 ratios ) .",
    "this could be a result of the extra energy input from an active galactic nucleus heating the circumnuclear dust .",
    "pg 1634 + 706 is a very powerful quasar whose uv emission may drive up dust temperatures over a very large volume .    using the co size upper limit of @xmath59 ,",
    "the upper limit on the dynamical mass in mg 0414 + 0523 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ( unknown ) lensing magnification factor , and the inclination angle @xmath62 has been taken to be @xmath63 .",
    "a very conservative upper limit to the molecular hydrogen mass is @xmath64 ( this would correspond to galactic molecular clouds , whereas in infrared galaxies and quasars it is thought that the h@xmath65 mass to co luminosity ratio is much lower  see barvainis et al 1997 ; shier , rieke , & reike 1994 ) .",
    "so the molecular hydrogen mass is well below the current limit on the dynamical mass . a value or a better limit will follow with high resolution measurements of co(@xmath66 ) at 1 mm wavelength .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that co fluxes are not subject to microlensing , reddening , or intrinsic variability like the optical fluxes are .",
    "when sensitive , high resolution ( @xmath67 ) co observations become available they can be used as an accurate data set for helping constrain the macrolensing parameters of the gravitational lens system toward mg 0414 + 0534 , as has recently been done for the cloverleaf quasar ( kneib et al 1997 ) .",
