    "turbulence spans a wide range of scales , from small scales in the dissipation and inertial subranges to large scales in the energy - containing subrange .",
    "while the small scales have been studied in detail,@xcite the large scales have not thus far .",
    "there should remain unknown features that are crucial to understand the basic physics of turbulence . here , we reveal that the rate of energy dissipation , the energy at each scale , and the total energy fluctuate significantly over large scales in lognormal distributions . this lognormality is expected to be universal because it is observed regardless of the reynolds number and the configuration for turbulence production .",
    "landau@xcite was the first to discuss such a large - scale fluctuation .",
    "the discussion was that the local rate of energy dissipation @xmath0 should fluctuate significantly in space over large scales .",
    "obukhov@xcite also discussed the large - scale @xmath0 fluctuation .",
    "the @xmath0 fluctuation was assumed to be lognormal .",
    "this is because the fluctuation of any positive quantity could be approximated by a lognormal distribution with appropriate values for the average and standard deviation .",
    "the large - scale fluctuations are known to exist on some level,@xcite but their details are not known .",
    "experimentally or numerically , any detailed study requires long data that are composed of numerous ensembles .",
    "each ensemble is required to cover smallest to largest scales of turbulence .",
    "such long data have not been available .",
    "the situation is nevertheless improving for laboratory experiments , owing to improvements of the measurement technologies .",
    "we have accordingly undertaken experimental studies of large - scale fluctuations.@xcite by using long velocity data obtained in a wind tunnel , we have shown that the large - scale fluctuations are always significant.@xcite their standard deviations are comparable to the averages . also for a case of grid turbulence , we have shown that the large - scale fluctuations of the energy dissipation rate , the energy at each scale , and the total energy are lognormal.@xcite    the next problem is whether the large - scale lognormal fluctuations exist in other turbulent flows . for grid turbulence , boundary layers , and jets at different reynolds numbers ,",
    "we show that the lognormal fluctuations do exist .",
    "the standard deviations are almost the same among the flows .",
    "it is thereby implied that the lognormality is not a mere approximation@xcite but is due to some common process .",

    "there exist various forms of sufficient but not necessary conditions.@xcite the essence is that the stochastic variables are all alike and no few of them dominate the others .",
    "it is also required that , among the variables , correlations are absent exactly or at least practically .",
    "these requirements have to be satisfied by the interactions among scales that are to reproduce the observed lognormality .",
    "the interactions are also required to involve a wide range of scales because the lognormal fluctuations are observed up to large @xmath150 and down to small @xmath162 .",
    "large scales are especially important as implied by the observed features of the standard deviations and correlations ( secs .",
    "[ s3a ] and [ s3c ] ) .",
    "the central limit theorem does not determine the distribution at its tail , which might deviate from the lognormal distribution and even might depend on the reynolds number or the flow configuration .",
    "whether such a tail is prominent depends on the case .",
    "an extreme case could be the observed deviation from the lognormality of @xmath187 in some datasets ( sec .",
    "[ s3b ] ) . nevertheless , the lognormality is important at least as an idealized model because it exists only if the logarithm is subject to the central limit theorem .",
    "the lognormality also accounts for most of the distributions in the observed range ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ) . to observe the distributions over the wider range , much longer data are necessary .",
    "the lognormal fluctuations exist at @xmath184@xmath185 , where the correlations @xmath159 and @xmath160 are weak but not yet absent [ figs .",
    "[ f1](a ) , [ f2](a ) , and [ f3](a ) ] .",
    "although the correlations there exhibit different profiles among the flow configurations , this difference is not relevant to the existence of the lognormality . outside the @xmath150 range ,",
    "the correlations are either too strong or absent .",
    "the lognormal fluctuations do not exist .    at @xmath232 ,",
    "the skewness and flatness factors of @xmath171 and @xmath81 deviate from the gaussian values [ figs .",
    "[ f1](c ) , [ f2](c ) , and [ f3](c ) ]",
    ". the fluctuations are not lognormal and no longer explained by a multiple of independent processes .",
    "this is because the correlations @xmath159 and @xmath160 are too strong .",
    "the observed deviation from the lognormality is different among the dataset .",
    "note that , among the figures , different are the ordinates for the skewness and flatness factors .",
    "since this @xmath150 range for small scales has been studied in detail,@xcite we do not study it any more .    at @xmath233 , the correlations @xmath159 and @xmath160 are absent .",
    "then , any segment with length @xmath150 is divisible into many subsegments that are independent of one another .",
    "the length @xmath234 of these subsegments is such that @xmath235 . by using a sum over the subsegments ,",
    "we write @xmath227 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath187 , and @xmath229 as , e.g. , @xmath236 here @xmath237 is the center of the @xmath238-th subsegment .",
    "the sum is subject to the central limit theorem and thereby fluctuates in a gaussian distribution.@xcite figures [ f1](d ) , [ f2](d ) , and [ f3](d ) show the skewness and flatness factors of @xmath229 , which in fact approach to the gaussian values with an increase of @xmath173.@xcite in other words , when @xmath173 is large enough , quantities such as @xmath239 are additive.@xcite the value of an additive quantity for a region is the sum of its values for the subregions that are independent of one another.@xcite such additive quantities are well known in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , for which correlations are absent over scales of interest .",
    "for several flows of laboratory turbulence , we obtained long records of velocity data .",
    "these records were divided into numerous segments with length @xmath150 . in each segment , we calculated the mean rate of energy dissipation @xmath227 , the mean energies @xmath167 and @xmath168 at scale @xmath162 , and the mean total energies @xmath187 and @xmath229 . their values fluctuate significantly and synchronously .",
    "the fluctuations are lognormal .",
    "since the lognormality is observed regardless of the reynolds number and the configuration for turbulence production , it is expected to be universal .",
    "the lognormal fluctuations are of large scales , @xmath184@xmath185 , where the correlations @xmath159 and @xmath160 are weak but not yet absent .",
    "this @xmath150 range had not been studied , although it lies in between the ranges that had been studied in detail .",
    "we explained the lognormal fluctuations by applying the central limit theorem to the logarithm of a multiplicative stochastic process , which was related to interactions among many scales through the energy transfer .",
    "to apply the central limit theorem , it is required that the interactions are all alike and do not have mutual correlations .",
    "in addition , features of the observed fluctuations require that the interactions involve a wide range of scales .",
    "large scales are especially important .",
    "the first discussion on large - scale fluctuations was by landau,@xcite who argued against the universality of small - scale statistics discussed by kolmogorov.@xcite kolmogorov discussed that small - scale statistics depend on @xmath18 and @xmath57 alone and are thus universal .",
    "landau discussed that small - scale statistics are not universal because the large - scale @xmath0 fluctuation is significant and is not universal . in practice ,",
    "large - scale fluctuations are universally lognormal .",
    "their standard deviations are also almost universal .",
    "even if large scales affect small scales through the @xmath0 fluctuation,@xcite it does not necessarily violate the universality of small - scale statistics . however , past experiments suggested that some small - scale statistics are not universal and depend on the large - scale flow.@xcite since the reynolds numbers of these studies might not have been high enough to distinguish between small and large scales,@xcite it is desirable to study the effect of large scales on small scales at the higher reynolds numbers .    finally , we note that the large - scale lognormal fluctuations are not restricted to those of turbulence",
    ". they should also exist in other nonlinear systems that have many degrees of freedom .",
    "this is because , regardless of the process details , lognormality exists only if the logarithm is subject to the central limit theorem .",
    "however , so far as we could see , no example is known .",
    "it is desirable to explore the lognormal fluctuations in various systems , promisingly over length scales or timescales where correlations are weak but not yet absent .",
    "we expect that the large - scale lognormal fluctuations turn out to be ubiquitous , far beyond those of turbulence observed here .",

    "this fact is nevertheless not serious to our study , for which it is sufficient to prepare a variety of turbulent flows .",
    "the alternative interpretation is that such fluctuations correspond to spatial fluctuations of some virtual turbulence .",
    "local values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent local regions of actual turbulence and are continuously connected up to largest scales ( see also appendix of ref . ) .",
    "the two wires individually respond to all the @xmath9 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 components .",
