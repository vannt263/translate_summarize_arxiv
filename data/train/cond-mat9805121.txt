    "the electrical transport in two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrays of small josephson tunnel junctions can be described either in terms of charges or in terms of vortices @xcite .",
    "transport of charge generates a current which acts as a driving force for the vortices .",
    "the charge transport may be obstructed by a large charging energy , @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the capacitance of the individual junction . on the other hand , transport of vortices",
    "generates a voltage which acts as a driving force for the charges .",
    "the vortex transport may be hindered if the josephson coupling energy is large .",
    "at low temperature the josephson coupling energy is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the normal state resistance of the individual junctions , @xmath5k@xmath6 is the quantum resistance , and @xmath7 is the superconducting energy gap of the electrodes .    adding a single charge to an electrode in the array gives rise to an electrostatic potential distribution which is sometimes referred to as a charge soliton@xcite . a missing charge gives rise to the counterpart , an anti - soliton .",
    "the charge solitons can move in the array by single - charge tunnel events .",
    "when the electrodes are superconducting , both single electron solitons ( ses ) and cooper pair solitons ( cps ) can exist .",
    "an exact calculation of the potential distribution in a @xmath8 junction array assuming only nearest neighbor coupling , is shown in fig.[soliton ] , for two different cases : a single electron in the center of the array , giving rise to a ses , and the fundamental excitation , a soliton / anti - soliton pair at adjacent electrodes .",
    "the size of the soliton is given by @xmath9 as long as @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the capacitance between an electrode in the array and infinity .",
    "however if @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath11 the nearest neighbor approach is not a good approximation @xcite .    on the other hand , due to the existence of a macroscopic phase of the superconductor , a vortex , _",
    "i.e. _ a phase winding of 2@xmath12 , with an associated magnetic flux quantum @xmath13 , can exist in a loop of the array . in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of small josephson tunnel junctions",
    "the duality between charges and vortices is especially pronounced .",
    "therefore it is a very suitable object to study the dynamics of both charges and vortices .",
    "the arrays which have high junction resistance , @xmath14 and large charging energy , @xmath15 , become insulating at low temperature due to the coulomb blockade@xcite , regardless of whether the electrodes are superconducting or normal .    in the opposite limit , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , superconductivity prevails and the resistance goes to zero at low temperature . in this limit where the josephson energy dominates ,",
    "vortices act as classical or quasi - classical particles and there is a large number of papers describing such systems theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite with normal electrodes and @xmath14 the array goes insulating at low temperature while in the opposite limit @xmath16 , the array stays resistive even down to very low temperature .    in this paper we will concentrate on the arrays where the charging energy is comparable to or larger than the josephson coupling energy , and where the junction resistance is of the order of or larger than @xmath18 . throughout this paper",
    ", we will refer to an array with normal electrodes as being in the n - state , and to an array with superconducting electrodes as being in the s - state .",
    "if the interaction between the charges ( or vortices ) is logarithmic , the transition to the insulating ( superconducting ) state would be of the kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii ( ktb ) type@xcite . as the temperature is increased , an insulating 2d array can undergo a charge unbinding transition@xcite at some transition temperature , which results in a conductive state .",
    "likewise , a superconducting array can undergo a vortex unbinding transition to a resistive state .",
    "it has been shown that the superconducting transition can be described as a vortex unbinding , ktb transition@xcite .",
    "in more recent years there has also been a lot of interest in arrays where the dynamics is best described in terms of charges @xcite . in several papers",
    "there has been a discussion whether the observed transition to the insulating state can be described as a ktb transition as well@xcite . in a paper by tighe",
    "et al.@xcite it was pointed out that the transition could be well described by thermal activation of charge solitons . comparing results of three different groups@xcite",
    ", they found an activation energy @xmath19 in the n - state , a value which can be theoretically justified .",
    "they also suggested that in the s - state at @xmath20 , @xmath21 should be @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the superconducting energy gap at @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "an interesting new result is that of kanda and kobayashi @xcite where they find a thermal activation behavior at higher temperatures but a stronger dependence at lower temperature in the n - state . an interesting theoretical development in this field is a recent paper by feigelman et al.@xcite , where they treat the posibility of parity effects 2d arrays . in section [ insulating ]",
    "we will describe measurements where we have investigated the transition to the insulating state extensively .    for",
    "arrays in the intermediate regime ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) which just barely go superconducting , a small magnetic field can drastically change the low bias resistance and in fact drive the array into the insulating state @xcite . in a theoretical description of this effect @xcite ,",
    "the field induced excess vortices drive the system from a vortex glass superconducting phase into a bose - condensed insulating phase .",
    "the zero - magnetic - field ktb vortex - unbinding transition is replaced by a field - tuned vortex - delocalization transition .",
    "a superconductor - insulator(si ) transition can also be driven by other external variables such as electric field @xcite or dissipation @xcite . in section [ sit ]",
    "we show experiments on the magnetic - field - tuned superconductor - insulator transition . the zero bias resistance , @xmath27 was measured as a function of temperature and frustration . the frustration , @xmath28 is defined as the magnetic field normalized to @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the field corresponding to one flux quantum per unit cell in the array .",
    "the scaling curves demonstrate how @xmath27 , plotted as a particular function of @xmath30 and @xmath28 , display a transition from insulator to superconductor .",
    "according to theory the resistance at the critical frustration @xmath31 should be universal and equal to @xmath18 . from the data of four different arrays we find a value which is of the order of @xmath18 but sample dependent .",
    "we can also deduce a dynamic exponent close to unity , which is in agreement with the theory @xcite .",
    "right at the critical frustration , the hall resistance is very small compared with the longitudinal resistance , indicating a small hall effect at the si transition .",
    "however for frustration values larger than the critical frustration the hall resistance can be relatively large .",
    "hall measurements in both conventional superconductors @xcite and high-@xmath32 superconductors @xcite have shown a sign reversal of the hall resistivity in the vicinity of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath32 , where the samples are in a mixed state .",
    "hall measurements have also been performed on disordered superconductors near the superconductor - to - insulator transition @xcite . in section [ hall ]",
    "we present the frustration dependence of the longitudinal resistance @xmath33 and the hall resistance @xmath34 .",
    "both the longitudinal and hall resistance are periodic functions of the magnetic filed , and the hall resistance changes sign at several magnetic fields within one period .",
    "we also describe the dc measurements of longitudinal voltage @xmath35 and the hall voltage @xmath36 as a function of bias current @xmath37 .",
    "the arrays are fabricated on unoxidized silicon substrates , using a combination of photo- and electron - beam - lithography and an angle evaporation technique .",
    "aluminum is used for both top and bottom electrodes .",
    "the number of junctions in each row , n , is the same as the number of junctions in each column , with n ranging between 10 and 168 .",
    "therefore , the array resistance equals the individual junction resistance , assuming a homogeneous array .",
    "the samples are made in two steps .",
    "first a gold contact pattern is made with conventional photo lithography , and then the actual array is made with electron - beam lithography the contact pattern contains a large number of 7x7mm@xmath38 chips distributed over a 2 inch wafer area , each with 16 contact pads leading to a central area of 160x160@xmath39m@xmath38 . a double metal layer of 20 nm chromium - nickel and 80 nm gold is evaporated and the redundant metal is lifted off in acetone . the chromium - nickel film makes the gold stick better to the surface .",
    "a double layer e - beam resist consisting of a @xmath40210 nm thick bottom layer of p(mma / maa ) copolymer is spun onto the wafer and a @xmath4060 nm thick top layer of pmma(950k ) is used .",
    "the chip is mounted in an e - beam lithography instrument and the central area of each chip is exposed using the array pattern .",
    "a current of 20 - 30pa corresponding to a beam size of about 10 nm is used .",
    "the beam voltage is 50kv and the area dose is 160 - 200@xmath39c / cm@xmath38 .",
    "each chip is then developed in two different developers : first for @xmath4010 - 20s in the pmma developer which consists of a 1:3 mixture of toluene and isopropanol , then for 20 - 40s in the copolymer developer which consists of a 1:5 mixture of ethyl - cellosolve - acetate ( eca ) and ethanol . as an alternative",
    "the nontoxic mixture of 5 - 10 % water in isopropanol can be used to develop both layers in one step , with a development time of 1 - 2 minutes .",
    "after development , the resist mask contains an undercut pattern with suspended bridges@xcite which will be used to form the junctions . by depositing bottom and top electrodes from different angles",
    "the overlap can be controlled .",
    "the base and top electrodes are evaporated from tungsten boats , while the substrate holder is tilted at two different angles ( @xmath42 ) to give the desired overlap . before the top electrode is deposited , a tunnel barrier is formed by introducing 0.01 - 0.1 mbar of oxygen to the chamber for 3 - 10 minutes , by adjusting the oxidation parameters we get the desired junction resistance .",
    "a drawback with the angle evaporation technique is that a relatively large junction is formed in series with the small tunnel junction , see fig.[layout ] .",
    "the effect of this larger junction can in most cases be neglected , if its area is much larger than the area of the smaller junction .",
    "this is easy to make , but this requirement limits the minimum unit cell size of the array , which in turn decreases the soliton size .    the fabrication procedure results in junctions with normal state resistances in the range 4 to 150k@xmath6 , capacitances of the order of 1ff , and @xmath43@xmath39v per junction .",
    "the typical unit cell size is of the order of @xmath44m@xmath38 these values are deduced from the @xmath45-characteristics , assuming an offset voltage of @xmath46 ( for a discussion of the offset value see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the josephson coupling energies of the individual junctions are determined@xcite from @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath49 for the aluminum is in the range of 1.35 to 1.60k .",
    "the self capacitance of each electrode @xmath50 depends on the size of the electrode and the size of the array , and can be estimated to be of the order 10 - 20af for the smaller arrays ( # 2 and # 3 ) and about 2af for the other arrays .",
    "this results in a soliton size in the range of 11 to 35 , measured in units of the lattice spacing .",
    "the most important parameters of the 2d arrays described in this paper are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the arrays are divided into 3 groups .",
    "arrays # 1 - 3 show a decreasing resistance for decreasing temperature , and are referred to as the `` superconducting '' arrays .",
    "they have a low resistance , @xmath51 and a relatively large josephson coupling energy , @xmath52 .",
    "arrays # 4 - 8 show also go superconducting at low temperature , but they display the magnetic field tuned si transition , and are referred to as the `` intermediate '' arrays .",
    "they have @xmath25 and @xmath53 .",

    "shows hysteresis @xcite .",
    "our classification of the `` insulating '' arrays roughly agrees with the classification suggested by fazio and schn@xcite shown as a dashed line in fig.[schmid ] .",
    "however , a few of the arrays ( # 9 - 11 ) which show `` insulating '' behavior fall slightly outside the insulating area predicted by fazio and schn .    in section [ insulating ] , we will concentrate on the `` insulating '' arrays , but we will also present the n - state properties of the `` superconducting '' arrays . the n - state may be thought of as lying on the x - axis of the diagram in fig.[schmid ] .",
    "sections [ sit ] and [ hall ] will discuss the `` intermediate '' arrays .",
    "fig.[layout ] shows a typical sample , and the inset shows the probe layout for the hall measurements .",
    "there are four hall probe pairs situated at 1/6 , 1/3 , 1/2 and 5/6 the distance between the ends of the array .",
    "each hall probe is actually an array of @xmath69 junctions , with the outer side shorted by a strip from which the hall voltage is taken . in this way we can reduce the influence on the sample behavior arising from the presence of the voltage probes , and we are less sensitive to local defects possibly occurring in the probe .",
    "the resistance of the probe arrays is presumably similar to that of the array itself .",
    "this resistance is much smaller than the input impedance of our voltage amplifiers .",
    "the measurements are performed in a dilution refrigerator which is situated in an electrically shielded room .",
    "a magnetic field up to about 1400 g is applied perpendicular to the substrate . the magnetic field needed to produce one magnetic flux quantum per unit cell , @xmath56 , varied between 10.4 g and 43.1 g for the different arrays .",
    "this is much less than the critical magnetic field , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 g ) , which was needed to bring the aluminum electrodes into the n - state .",
    "all measurements are made with the biasing and the measurement circuitry symmetric with respect to ground .",
    "the current - voltage(@xmath45)-characteristics of the arrays are recorded at temperatures down to about 25mk .",
    "the threshold voltages are deduced from the ivc measured as the voltage at which the current has dropped to two times the noise level ( going from large bias ) .",
    "the rms current - noise determined at low voltage is typically of the order of 0.1pa or less .    for the insulating arrays we deduce the zero bias resistance @xmath72 from the @xmath45-characteristics . for the `` superconducting '' and `` intermediate arrays '' ,",
    "@xmath72 can also be measured with an ac - technique using lock - in amplifiers , with excitation currents in the range 0.01 - 3 na , and frequencies of the order of 10hz .    the longitudinal voltage @xmath35 is measured at the superconducting strips at the ends of the array , and the hall voltage @xmath36 is measured on the probes located on opposite sites of the array .",
    "the hall data presented here were measured from the probes located in the center of the array , see the inset of fig.[layout ]",
    "the large scale @xmath45-characteristics of the arrays are very similar for the 11 arrays and they resemble the @xmath45-characteristics of a single high resistance josephson junction . in the s - state there is a sharp rise in the conductance at a voltage @xmath73 . at high voltages the @xmath45-characteristics are linear and",
    "there is the usual offset voltage which is due to the coulomb blockade @xcite . in the n - state",
    "the gap feature disappears but the offset voltage remains .    for low bias in the s - state ,",
    "the @xmath45-characteristics differ drastically for the different arrays .",
    "qualitative similarities can be found between these @xmath45-curves and those of single junctions biased through high impedance resistors @xcite .",
    "arrays # 1 - 8 show a supercurrent - like feature at low bias , and @xmath72 decreases for decreasing temperature .",
    "arrays # 9 - 15 show a coulomb blockade feature at low bias , and @xmath72 increases for decreasing temperature .",
    "the threshold voltage @xmath74 is the voltage at which solitons can be injected into the array . according to theory",
    "@xcite , the threshold voltage for injection of sess in the n - state should be    @xmath75    for a symmetrically biased array with @xmath76 .",
    "it is important to make the distinction between symmetric and asymmetric ( one side grounded ) bias of the array , since the latter gives a factor of two lower threshold voltage .",
    "however , it has been show by middelton and wingreen @xcite that the background charges modifies the picture and that the threshold voltage actually scales with the length of the array if the effect of random background charges is taken into account .    in the n - state ,",
    "all arrays show coulomb blockade feature at low temperature and low bias , but the threshold is smeared .",
    "however there is no sharp threshold voltage in the n - state for most of the arrays . only for array # 15 , which has the largest @xmath47 , we can deduce a threshold voltage of about 0.25mv(see fig.[vt ] ) .",
    "note that the onset of current occurs at a substantially higher voltage for intermediate magnetic fields .",
    "for those fields however the onset was more gradual .",
    "a similar behavior was observed in all of the `` insulating '' arrays .",
    "all of our arrays were symmetrically biased and for array # 15 we get a theoretical value of @xmath77mv , according to eq.[vteq ] .",
    "the fact that the measured value is substantially lower than the theoretically predicted one , is consistent with the picture that quantum fluctuations effectively lower the energy barrier for injection of charge @xcite .    in the s - state",
    "there was a sharp threshold for all the `` insulating '' arrays , except for arrays # 10 and # 11 .",
    "@xmath74 is shown as a function of @xmath78 for four of the arrays in fig.[vt(b ) ] . for several of the arrays",
    "@xmath74 oscillates with @xmath78 , demonstrating that cooper pair solitons are injected at low magnetic fields .",
    "the period of oscillation corresponds to one flux quantum per unit cell and agrees well with the @xmath56 values of the different arrays .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath74 correspond to the oscillations in activation energy , described in section [ insulating ] , and the oscillation peaks in @xmath74 and @xmath21 occur at the same @xmath78 values ( compare figs.[ea(b ) ] and [ vt(b ) ] ) . for increasing magnetic field the threshold voltage increases and peaks at a field in the range of 250 to 450 g , which is well below the critical field @xmath70 for the electrodes .",
    "@xmath74 then decreases rapidly at larger @xmath78 .",
    "the threshold voltage in the s - state has , to our knowledge , not been described theoretically in the literature . however , following the arguments in ref.@xcite , and neglecting the josephson coupling energy , we can estimate @xmath74 for two different situations . for direct injection of cooper pair solitons",
    ", we get a threshold voltage which is two times higher than the value for single electron solitons , @xmath79 .",
    "the other possibility is that a cooper - pair is broken up and then a single electron is injected .",
    "then the threshold would be @xmath80 for the case of symmetric bias . for all our arrays @xmath81 at @xmath20 , and therefore we would expect injection of cooper pairs to be responsible for the threshold .",
    "this agrees well with our observation of the oscillating @xmath74 at low magnetic field .",
    "the increase of @xmath74 with increasing magnetic field can be understood in the following way .",
    "since @xmath82 , and thereby @xmath83 , decreases with increasing magnetic field it becomes harder to inject cooper - pairs , and therefore @xmath74 increases . at some magnetic field",
    "the threshold for single electrons will become equal to that for cooper - pairs ( @xmath84 ) and we would expect a crossover from cooper - pair injection to single electron injection .",
    "this is observed in all the samples as a peak in @xmath74 at magnetic fields in the range 250 to 450 g . beyond this",
    "crossover @xmath85 decreases as a function of increasing @xmath78 , due to the decreasing @xmath82 .    to get a more quantitative description , other effects depending on the array size and the background charge , as well as co - tunneling and the josephson coupling , would have to be included .",
    "the fact that the observed values at @xmath20 are generally lower than the `` theoretical '' value @xmath86 , can possibly be explained if the josephson coupling energy is taken into account .",
    "a step in this direction is a recent paper on 1d - arrays where the threshold dependence on @xmath87 is discussed @xcite .",
    "the current above the threshold has been analyzed using scaling theory by rimberg et al .",
    "@xcite .      in an array which is strongly superconducting",
    "there is no hall voltage since the hall probes would be shorted . in an array with a strong coulomb blockade",
    "the whole array is insulating and therefore the hall probes are effectively disconnected , and no hall voltage can be measured .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that it is only the `` intermediate '' arrays which show some hall voltage . in fig.[iv]a",
    "we see the @xmath88 characteristics for sample # 5 which shows a sharp dip in the current before entering the flux - flow regime , characterized by @xmath89 being proportional to @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath91 curve , shown in fig.[iv]b , displays a very similar feature , but the hall voltage is about two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "as the current is reversed , the hall voltage changes sign as expected .    in the flux - flow regime",
    ", both @xmath35 and @xmath36 increases linearly with applied current until the longitudinal voltage reaches the sum gap voltage of the entire array ( @xmath92mv ) . at this point",
    ", the hall voltage reaches a maximum of about 0.2mv and then starts to fluctuate , gradually decreasing almost to zero . at still higher currents , the hall voltage displays rich structure , which can also be seen in the derivative of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath37 .    at very high currents , when @xmath35 is on the normal resistance branch of the @xmath93 curve , the hall voltage @xmath36 also increases linearly with the applied current , with slope @xmath94 . because this slope is a small fraction of @xmath47 ( 0.02% for array # 5 and 0.1% for array # 7 )",
    "we conclude that small non - uniformities exist in the array . for array # 7 , the hall voltage as a function of bias current shows very similar behavior to that of array # 5 .",
    "the zero bias resistance was measured as a function of both temperature and magnetic field .",
    "all arrays showed an `` insulating '' behavior in the n - state , meaning that @xmath72 increased as a function of decreasing temperature . over a fairly wide range of temperature",
    "the @xmath95 dependence was exponential as can be seen in fig.[thermalactivation ] , indicating thermal activation of charge solitons .",
    "however , @xmath72 saturates and is no longer temperature dependent at the lowest temperatures , ( beyond the range displayed in fig.[thermalactivation ] ) .",
    "this saturation has been discussed in ref.@xcite and here we will concentrate on the thermal activation .    in the s - state , @xmath72 increased even more rapidly as a function of decreasing temperature for the `` insulating '' arrays . the @xmath72 versus",
    "@xmath30 curves can be divided into three temperature regions ( see fig.[thermalactivation ] ) .",
    "i ) in a temperature range below 500mk , @xmath72 increases exponentially with decreasing temperature , and an activation energy can be defined .",
    "ii ) at higher temperatures the dependence was not purely exponential due to the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap .",
    "iii ) for the lowest temperatures @xmath72 became larger than 1g@xmath6 ( not shown in the figure ) , and could not be measured accurately with our experimental setup .    in a temperature interval roughly between 200mk and 500mk , @xmath72 for the `` insulating '' arrays",
    "could be fitted by a thermal activation dependence over the whole magnetic field range , such that    @xmath96    where @xmath21 is the activation energy and @xmath97 is a constant .",
    "it should be noted that there is a region of magnetic field slightly below @xmath70 where the superconducting gap goes to zero in the temperature interval where the fit is made to determine @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath98 vs. @xmath99 plots are not perfectly linear at those magnetic fields .",
    "however the arrhenius law ( [ arrhenius ] ) is still a fair approximation .",
    "the fact that we do not observe a ktb charge unbinding transition in these arrays is not altogether surprising .",
    "it was shown by zaikin and panyukov @xcite , that the effect of offset charges will effectively cut of the logarithmic interaction between the charges .",
    "also , the finite size of our samples is probably a limiting factor .    in the n - state",
    ", @xmath21 was found to be close to @xmath100 ( see table [ table1 ] ) , and b was very close to @xmath47 , for all the `` insulating '' arrays .",
