    "the device can be biased such that it oscillates on two modes simultaneously with the same average power level . unlike the case of polarization modes in vcsels , the mode spacing is in the highly non - degenerate regime , allowing us to develop studies of the multimode nonlinear dynamics in the minimal possible two mode system .",

    "rate equation approaches have proven very successful in the case of modeling the dynamical response of single mode semiconductor lasers . in the case of multimode dynamics , however , a number of different models have been developed that differ in how the dynamics of the carrier density are described @xcite .",
    "here we provide an experimental and theoretical study of antiphase dynamics when one of the two primary modes of the device is optically injected . among the rich variety of multimode dynamical phenomena we have found limit - cycle , quasiperiodic and chaotic antiphase dynamics as well as regions where the optical power is largely switched to the _ uninjected _ mode .",
    "as we will show , all of these dynamics , as well as the familiar injection locking on a single mode , can be found by performing a sweep over a large detuning range of the injected field for a certain fixed injected field intensity .",

    "we then demonstrate that a four dimensional rate equation model reproduces the overall experimental picture very well .",
    "in particular , we show how regions of quasiperiodic antiphase dynamics that we have observed experimentally are reproduced in numerical simulations and that new bifurcation structure , which is particular to the two mode system considered , governs the appearance of these dynamics .",

    "[ pra2 ] , we find that in the corresponding region only the detuning frequency is present .",
    "this is then a region of wave mixing or beating between the injected field and the long wavelength primary mode .    as the detuning is decreased , a period doubling bifurcation occurs and we enter a region where a new frequency equal to one - half of the detuning frequency is present in fig .",

    "these antiphase time traces have a distinctive sawtooth structure that results from the growing or decaying oscillations that form each pulse .",
    "they are remarkably similar to the so - called regular pulse packages that can be observed in semiconductor lasers with optical feedback in the short external cavity regime @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of optical injection , the fast time scale is determined by the relaxation oscillation and its harmonics , rather than the external cavity frequency .",

    "this low frequency component is responsible for the appearance of a cascade of frequencies that are centered at the relaxation oscillation peak and its harmonic .    as the detuning is decreased further , the frequency difference between the relaxation oscillation and the detuning approaches half of the relaxation oscillation frequency . in this region a weak period two region of the total intensity is found . for detunings less than approximately one - half the relaxation oscillation frequency",
    "we find coupled chaotic dynamics that are characterised by broad - band spectra .    for negative detunings ,",
    "the single mode locking region is found , which extends to a detuning of approximately -5 ghz . at the boundary of the stable locking region , inside of which",

    "we used the values @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ( twice threshold ) , and @xmath19 .",
    "then the value of the relaxation oscillation frequency is @xmath20 ghz , in agreement with experiment .",
    "the cross and self saturation are determined by @xmath21 and we use the values @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which is consistent with the stability of the two mode solution in the free running laser .    note that although we have provided a complex equation for the field @xmath7 , the phase of @xmath7 is in fact decoupled leading to a four - dimensional system of equations where only the intensity of the uninjected mode influences the dynamics .",
    "in addition , the single mode dynamics is contained within the invariant submanifold ( @xmath25 ) in these equations .",
    "our model equations are therefore a minimal extension of the ( three dimensional ) single mode case and follow from the fact that the primary mode spacing in the device considered is in the highly non - degenerate regime .",
    "this system only considers a single averaged carrier density and a general cross and self saturation of the gain .",
    "more complex models of the multiwavelength dynamics are available that are derived by considering additional fourier components of the carrier density .",
    "one example includes the effect of static spatial hole burning explicitly leading to a system with two carrier density equations , one defined for each field @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that these equations lead to some unphysical results in the injected system , such as a stable injection locked region where the uninjected mode is not suppressed .",
    "another modeling approach @xcite includes an asymmetric term that is associated with a dynamic grating formed in the carrier density profile .",
    "this term effectively represents the mutual injection or wave mixing interaction of the primary modes and has been shown to play a role in the _",

    ". this grating is also responsible for the formation of four - wave mixing sidebands in the free running two - mode laser considered here @xcite .",
    "however , we have found equivalent experimental results for injection at both the long and short wavelength primary modes , suggesting that this grating does not significantly affect the dynamics .",
    "we attribute this to the very large separation of the primary modes of the device ( 480 ghz ) , which means that the dynamic grating is weakly developed , with large sidebands observed because of enhancement by the fabry - prot cavity .    using the model equations",

    "we emphasize that this torus bifurcation is a feature the two mode system that is not present in the single mode case .",
    "due to this torus bifurcation an additional incommensurate low frequency of about @xmath36 appears as previously identified in the discussion of the characteristic sawtooth antiphase time traces of fig .",
    "note that outside of the boundary of the torus bifurcation , the two mode period doubled limit cycle is only weakly stable and noise will be able to excite low frequency antiphase dynamics .",
    "this explains the relatively broad region of antiphase dynamics observed experimentally in fig .",
    "[ pra2 ] . as we further lower the detuning frequency to @xmath37 , the two mode limit cycle exchanges stability with a single mode limit cycle in a transcritical bifurcation ( striped blue line in fig .  [ pra8 ] ) .",

    "this scenario is in agreement with experimental data of fig .",
    "[ pra2 ] , where we observe that the spectral density evolves continuously across the lower boundary of region ( i ) .",
    "as we decrease @xmath0 further , the single mode period doubled limit cycle undergoes an inverse period doubling bifurcation ( dashed magenta line in fig .  [ pra8 ] ) and a single period limit cycle is generated .",
    "this is experimentally verified by the disappearance of the frequency at @xmath38 , which happens below the lower boundary of region ( i ) , i.e. _ after _ we have switched to a single mode state .",
    "the generated single period limit cycle , which experimentally corresponds to the single mode wave mixing state , remains stable until we encounter a saddle node bifurcation of limit cycles ( orange line snl in fig .",
    "[ pra8 ] ) at @xmath39 . at this point",
    "the stable single mode limit cycle collides with an unstable one , and both limit cycles disappear @xcite .",
    "the dynamics are then blown out from the single mode manifold where the associated bursting dynamics explains the brief broadening which is observed in the experimental spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ pra2 ] ) and in the numerical spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ pra5a ] ) .",
    "close to the bifurcation point , the remainder of the stable limit cycle still forms a slow region on the single mode manifold , and thus the period of the resulting two mode orbit diverges close to the bifurcation point .",
    "away from the region of bursting dynamics this new incommensurate frequency results in a quasiperiodic orbit on a torus ( cf .",
    "fig [ pra7 ] ) .    moving away from the snl bifurcation point to lower @xmath0 , the frequency originating at zero increases linearly , and gives rise to satellite peaks around the second major frequency close to the relaxation oscillation frequency .",
    "this explains the striking star - like features in the experimental ( fig .",
    "[ pra2 ] ) and numerical ( fig .  [ pra5a ] ) spectra , which immediately follow the brief broadening discussed in the previous paragraph . just below the snl bifurcation , we are in a region with two incommensurate frequencies , which gives rise to quasiperiodic evolution on a stable torus manifold .",
    "the torus transforms into a limit cycle via an inverse torus bifurcation at @xmath40 ( red line in fig .",
    "[ pra8 ] ) , and in the power spectrum , the low frequency that was introduced by the snl bifurcation disappears again .",

    "[ pra8 ] ) , which disappears in a saddle node bifurcation ( dashed black line in fig .",
    "[ pra8 ] ) .",
    "then the remaining single mode limit cycle undergoes again a snl bifurcation followed by a torus bifurcation , as was discussed in the context of region ( ii ) .",
    "this defines the two mode region ( iv ) of fig .",
    "[ pra1 ] .    for even lower @xmath0",
    "we find a two mode equilibrium state ( tme ) , which is bounded by a hopf bifurcation .",
    "this region corresponds to the experimentally observed region below region ( iv ) in fig .",
    "[ pra1 ] , where the injected mode is suppressed .",
    "this suppression is a precursor to the appearance of a bistability between single - mode injection locking and a two mode equilibrium at larger negative detunings ( @xmath43 ghz ) and larger values of the injected field strength .",
    "we have recently demonstrated that this bistability can be the basis of an all - optical memory element based on switching of the uninjected mode @xcite .",

    ". this region will be the subject of more detailed study in future work .",
    "we have presented an experimental and theoretical study of antiphase dynamics in an optically injected two - mode laser diode .",
    "the device was a specially engineered fabry - perot laser designed to support two primary modes with a large ( thz ) frequency spacing . at a fixed injected field strength , injection in one of the primary modes of the device",

    "<S> a detailed experimental study of antiphase dynamics in a two - mode semiconductor laser with optical injection is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the device is a specially designed fabry - prot laser that supports two primary modes with a thz frequency spacing . </S>",
    "<S> injection in one of the primary modes of the device leads to a rich variety of single and two - mode dynamical scenarios , which are reproduced with remarkable accuracy by a four dimensional rate equation model . </S>",
    "<S> numerical bifurcation analysis reveals the importance of torus bifurcations in mediating transitions to antiphase dynamics and of saddle - node of limit cycle bifurcations in switching of the dynamics between single and two - mode regimes . </S>"
