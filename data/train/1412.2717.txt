    "a vector mode is defined here as a solution to the wave equation in free space whose electric field is given by the equation @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are cylindrical coordinates and @xmath7 is a solution to the radial part of the wave equation , e.g. , bessel - guassian @xcite , or laguerre - gaussian functions .",

    "the basis of vector modes comprises light s space and polarization degrees of freedom ; the number of mdm channels that can be used for mdm when using vector modes is the same as using , for example , oam modes together with polarization division multiplexing .",
    "to use vector modes for mdm , a mode ( de)multiplexer for vector modes is required . in general , a mode ( de)multiplexer ( separates ) combines @xmath16 spatial modes at the ( receiver ) transmitter of an optical communication system .",
    "for example , a mode ( de)multiplexer for oam modes that has been demonstrated is based on passive beam ( separation ) combining @xcite . in passive beam ( separation ) combining , data streams from @xmath16 single mode optical fibers ( smfs ) are transformed into @xmath16 oam modes , or vice vera , via matching their wavefronts with @xmath16 spatial light modulators ( slms ) .",
    "they are then ( separated ) combined via @xmath17 beam splitters .",
    "slms can also be used to generate vector modes @xcite .",
    "however , there are many methods to generate vector modes ; for example see @xcite . here",
    ", a liquid crystal technology referred to as a @xmath0-plate is used @xcite .",
    "analogous to how a slm matches an oam mode s wavefront , a @xmath0-plate matches a vector mode s spatially inhomogeneous state of polarization @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0-plate comprises a thin layer of pattern liquid crystal molecules in - between two thin glass plates .",

    "effectively , a @xmath0-plate is a half - wave plate with an azimuthally varying fast axis and can be mathematically represented by a jones matrix @xcite : @xmath22 it can be shown using jones calculus , upon propagation through a @xmath0-plate , the state of polarization of the fundamental mode of a smf , given by the jones vector @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , i.e. , a linear combination of horizontal and vertical polarization ) is transformed into a linear combination of vector modes , or vice versa , given by the equation : @xmath25",

    "the fabrication details can be found in @xcite . using the @xmath0-plates , a mode ( de)multiplexer for vector modes based on passive beam ( separation ) combining",
    "was constructed as shown in fig .",
    "as a mode multiplexer- the fundamental modes of two smfs at @xmath281550 nm were collimated to beam waists of @xmath23 mm using appropriate lenses ( l ) and then made to propagate through the @xmath0-plates .",
    "then , the light beams from each smf were aligned co - linearly via a non - polarizing beam splitter ( bs ) .",

    "1(b2 ) , respectively , along with their intensities as analyzed by a linear polarizer whose transmission axis is oriented at 0 , 45 , 90 , and 135 degrees with respect to the lab .",
    "using the mode ( de)multiplexer , four vector modes , each carrying a 20 gbit / s quadrature phase shift keyed ( qpsk ) signal on a single wavelength channel ( @xmath281550 nm ) , comprising an aggregate 80 gbit / s , were transmitted as one light beam @xmath21 m over the lab table .",
    "note , over this distance there is negligible atmospheric turbulence and beam divergence .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "the transmitter was as follows .",
    "first , the output of an external cavity laser ( ecl ) tuned to @xmath29 nm was modulated by an i - q modulator to generate a 20 gbit / s qpsk signal .",
    "the i - q modulator was driven by a two - channel pattern generator generating two 10 gbaud signals , being decorrelated pseudo - random - binary - bit - sequences of length @xmath30 , and comprising the in - phase ( i ) and quadrature ( q ) components of the qpsk signal .",
    "the signal was then amplified by a low - noise erbium doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) and polarization division multiplexed ( pdm ) by splitting and decorrelating it in two smfs , making the states of polarization in each smf mutually orthogonal , ( horizontal / vertical polarization ) , and then recombining them into one smf . finally , the resultant pdm - qpsk signal was mode multiplexed by again splitting and decorrelating it in two smfs which were then connected to the smfs of the mode ( de)multiplexer , resulting in four vector modes each carrying a 20 gbit / s qpsk signal .    at the mode ( de)multiplexer , due to twists and bends in the smfs , the channels of each pdm - qpsk signal are not necessarily horizontal and vertical polarization",
    "however they can be aligned using a polarization paddle controller ( pol - con ) .",
    "nonetheless , each channel is a linear combination of horizontal and vertical polarization as represented by two arbitrary antipodal points on the poincar sphere .",
    "therefore , as given by eq .",
    "5 , after propagation through a @xmath0-plate each channel of a pdm - qpsk signal is transformed into a linear combination of vector modes as represented by two arbitrary antipodal points on a higher - order poincar sphere @xcite .",
    "the channels originating from the @xmath20 and @xmath21 plates are labelled ch1/ch2 and ch3/ch4 as shown in fig .",
    "1(a4 ) and fig .",
    "1(b4 ) , respectively .",
    "the intensities of ch1/ch2 and ch3/ch4 , as recorded using the ingaas camera , are shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and fig .",
    "3(b ) , respectively .    after transmission over the lab table ,",
    "the receiver was as follows .",
    "first , the channels were mode demultiplexed into the two smfs of another mode ( de)multiplexer .",
    "note , ch1/ch2 and ch3/ch4 were received and discriminated via coupling to both smfs . in accordance with eq .",
    "3 , upon propagation through a @xmath20 plate , @xmath26 vector modes are transformed into horizontal / vertical polarization while @xmath27 vector modes are transformed into higher - order vector modes .",
    "the intensities of ch1/ch2 and ch3/ch4 at the smf corresponding to the @xmath20 @xmath0-plate , as recorded using an ingaas camera , are shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) and fig .",
    "3(d ) , respectively .",
    "as can be seen , ch1/ch2 were transformed back into the fundamental mode of a smf , i.e , a pdm - qpsk signal , and were coupled to the smf .",
    "however , ch3/ch4 were transformed into higher - order vector modes and were not coupled to the smf .",
    "the opposite is true for the @xmath21 @xmath0-plate .",
    "the intensities of ch1/ch2 and ch3/ch4 at the smf corresponding to the @xmath21 @xmath0-plate , as recorded using an ingaas camera , are shown in fig .",
    "3(e ) and fig .",
    "3(f ) , respectively . next",
    ", each resulting pdm - qpsk signal was amplified by an edfa and aligned via a pol - con to a polarization diversity coherent receiver where they were polarization demultiplexed and coherently detected .",
    "the polarization diversity coherent receiver comprised a polarizing splitter , followed by two optical hybrids , connected to another ecl ( `` local oscillator '' ) . via intradyne detection",
    ", the analog qpsk signals were converted to digital signals by four balanced detectors . using four digital oscilloscopes ,",
    "the resultant digital signals were captured at 40 gsample / s ( @xmath3120 ghz ) for offline digital signal processing ( dsp ) .",
    "the captured constellations of the qpsk signals for all channels are shown in fig 3(a ) .",
    "mode crosstalk ( mc ) is defined as the transfer of power ( signals ) between channels .",
    "mc for each channel was measured at the mode demultiplexer by transmitting one channel at a time and measuring the power received by each of all channels . a normalized mc  matrix \" , comprising the mc measurements , are shown in fig .",
    "there is @xmath3 - 16.7db ( @xmath32 ) mc for any channel . as can be seen , via the off - diagonal blocks , the greatest contribution to mc for any channel came from channels originating from different @xmath0-plates .",
    "as there is negligible atmospheric turbulence and beam divergence over the transmitted distance , this is attributed to mismatch of the numerical apertures and misalignment of the lenses with the smfs of the mode demultiplexer .",
    "mc may also originate from  mode impurity , \" i.e. , power is generated in vector modes other than those intended .",
    "a preliminary analysis indicates the vector modes as generated via the @xmath0-plates of the mode multiplexer have @xmath33db @xmath34 mode impurity .",
    "a detailed analysis of the measurement of mode impurity will be reported elsewhere .    for each channel and aback to back \" ( b2b ) channel , bit error rates ( ber )",
    "were measured as a function of optical signal to noise ratio ( osnr ) when all channels were simultaneously transmitted .",
    "ber vs. osnr curves are shown in fig .",
    "the b2b channel is the original qpsk signal , transmitted and received , when the @xmath0-plates are  turned off . \"",
    "the performance of each channel can be assessed via its power penalty ( pp ) , i.e. , the difference in osnr between each channel and the b2b channel at the forward error correction ( fec ) threshold ( ber = @xmath35 ) .",
    "the pps for all channels and their cumulative mcs are shown in table 1 .",
    "all channels reach a ber at the fec threshold with a pp @xmath3 3.41db .",
    "differences in pps are attributed to polarization dependent loss throughout the various smfs of the system and misalignment of the pol - cons .",
    "in conclusion , vector modes were used to increase the information capacity of fso via mdm . a mode ( de)multiplexer for vector modes based on a liquid crystal technology referred to as a @xmath0-plate was introduced . as a proof of principle , using the mode ( de)multiplexer four vector modes , each carrying a 20 gbit / s quadrature phase shift keying signal on a single wavelength channel ( @xmath11550 nm ) , comprising an aggregate 80 gbit / s , were transmitted @xmath21 m over the lab table , with @xmath3 - 16.4 db ( @xmath4 ) mode crosstalk .",
    "bers for all vector modes were measured at the forward error correction threshold with power penalties @xmath3 3.41db .",
    "it has been conjectured upon propagation through atmospheric turbulence a vector mode will experience less scintillation as compared to an oam mode @xcite .",
    "the propagation of vector modes through atmospheric turbulence is the subject of future work . when using oam modes for mdm , the deleterious effects of atmospheric turbulence can be compensated via wavefront measurements @xcite . when using vector modes for mdm , comparable compensation of atmospheric turbulence may be possible via the measurement of spatially inhomogeneous polarization @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , the transmission of an oam mode through scattering media depends on its polarization and oam @xcite . as vector modes are non - separable superpositions of circular polarized oam modes @xcite , a comparable study of vector modes may be of interest , especially with regard to atmospheric light scattering .",
    "vector modes are referred to as the  true modes \" of an optical fiber .",
    "use of the @xmath0-plate mode ( de)multiplexer for optical fiber communication , as well as its compatibility with wavelength division multiplexing , especially with regard to  ring core \" optical fibers , is the subject of current work @xcite .",
    "it is noted , there are other light beams that have spatially inhomogeneous states of polarization , such as , full poincare beams @xcite .",
    "however , as compared to vector modes , full poincare beams experience non - trivial dynamics upon propagation @xcite .",
