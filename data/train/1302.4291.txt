    "today , several decades after the pioneering work of lin & shu ( 1966 ) and the seminal papers by jog & solomon ( 1984a , b ) , it is widely accepted that stars and cold interstellar gas have an important interplay in the gravitational instability of galactic discs .",
    "the gravitational coupling between stars and gas does not alter the form of the local axisymmetric stability criterion , @xmath3 ( toomre 1964 ) , but makes the @xmath0 stability parameter dependent on the radial velocity dispersions and surface mass densities of the two components ( bertin & romeo 1988 ; elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; rafikov 2001 ; shen & lou 2003 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is also affected by other factors , such as the vertical structure of the disc ( shu 1968 ; romeo 1990 , 1992 , 1994 ; elmegreen 2011 ; romeo & wiegert 2011 ) , gas turbulence ( hoffmann & romeo 2012 ; shadmehri & khajenabi 2012 ) , and gas dissipation ( elmegreen 2011 ) .",
    "comprehensive analyses have shown that the two - component @xmath0 parameter has a large impact on the dynamics and evolution of spiral structure in galaxies ( see bertin & lin 1996 ) , and is also a useful diagnostic for exploring the link between disc instability and star formation ( leroy et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) introduced a simple and accurate approximation for the two - component @xmath0 parameter , which takes into account the stabilizing effect of disc thickness and predicts whether the local stability level is dominated by stars or gas .",
    "the romeo - wiegert approximation has been used for investigating the evolution of gravitationally unstable discs ( cacciato et al .",
    "2012 ; forbes et al .  2012 ) , the spiral structure of ngc 5247 ( khoperskov et al .",
    "2012 ) , the dynamical link between dark matter and hi in nearby galaxies ( meurer et al .",
    "2013 ) , as well as the link between disc stability and the relative distributions of stars , gas and star formation ( zheng et al .",
    "forbes et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concluded that the romeo - wiegert approximation is much faster to use than the @xmath0 stability parameter of rafikov ( 2001 ) : it speeds up their disc - evolution code by as much as one or two orders of magnitude !",
    "this is simply because such an approximation estimates @xmath0 analytically , without the need to minimize the dispersion relation over all wavenumbers , as is usually done .",
    "a fundamental problem that must be faced when analysing the stability of galactic discs is how to represent their complex structure using only two components .",
    "the results of such analyses are indeed very sensitive to the choice of the gaseous 1d velocity dispersion , @xmath4 : the colder the gas , the stronger its impact on the stability of the disc ( e.g. , jog & solomon 1984a ; bertin & romeo 1988 ) .",
    "choosing @xmath5 will represent molecular gas well ( wilson et al .",
    "2011 ) , but will overestimate the contribution of atomic gas and make the disc more unstable than it actually is .",
    "vice versa , choosing @xmath6 will represent hi well ( leroy et al .",
    "2008 ) , but will underestimate the contribution of @xmath2 and stabilize the disc artificially .",
    "intermediate values or more elaborate choices of @xmath4 will still not solve the problem .",
    "this motivates the use of a proper multi - component @xmath0 parameter .",
    "one of the first papers that discussed the gravitational instability of multi - component discs dates back to morozov ( 1981 ) .",
    "this author derived a dispersion relation that is valid for infinitesimally thin discs made of gas and @xmath7 stellar components .",
    "he also calculated the stability criterion for @xmath8 .",
    "rafikov ( 2001 ) derived a stability criterion that is valid for any @xmath7 and can easily be expressed in the usual form @xmath3.-component discs was made by romeo ( 1985 ) , pp .",
    "140145 and 215216 . ] in this paper , we introduce a new @xmath0 stability parameter , which has the same strong advantages as the romeo - wiegert approximation , and which is applicable to fully multi - component and realistically thick discs [ see eq .  ( 19 ) ] .",
    "we also show how to use our @xmath1 parameter for analysing the stability of galactic discs , and illustrate the strength of a multi - component analysis .",
    "we do so using a large sample of spirals from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) , and treating stars , hi and @xmath2 as three distinct components .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2",
    ", we review the basic case of two - component discs and further motivate the need for a multi - component analysis ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) , we present our @xmath1 parameter ( sects 2.22.4 ) , and we analyse the stability of things spirals ( sect .",
    "2.5 ) . in sect .  3",
    ", we discuss the weaknesses of @xmath1 , which are common to all @xmath0 parameters and stability criteria quoted here . in sect .  4 , we draw the conclusions .",
    "let us first discuss the case of two - component and infinitesimally thin discs , which is fundamental to a proper understanding of sects 2.22.5 .",
    "it is well known that the stability properties of such discs are determined by five basic quantities : the epicyclic frequency , @xmath9 , the stellar and gaseous surface densities , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the stellar radial velocity dispersion , @xmath12 , and the gaseous 1d velocity dispersion , @xmath13 ( e.g. , lin & shu 1966 ; rafikov 2001 ) .",
    "the last two quantities reflect an important dynamical difference between stars and cold interstellar gas .",
    "the stellar component is collisionless so its velocity dispersion is anisotropic , while gas is collisional and has an isotropic velocity dispersion ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "hereafter we will simplify the notation and denote the relevant velocity dispersions of the two components with @xmath14 and @xmath4 .",
    "lin & shu ( 1966 ) and rafikov ( 2001 ) took those facts into account by treating stars as a kinetic component and gas as a fluid ( see also shu 1968 ) .",
    "the resulting local axisymmetric stability criteria are equivalent because they are based on the same dispersion relation , @xmath15 , and because they are derived by imposing that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 . however , rafikov s stability criterion is simpler and more used ( e.g. , dalcanton et al .",
    "2004 ; li et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; kim & ostriker 2007 ; yang et al .",
    "2007 ; yim et al .",
    "such a criterion can be written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 @xmath20}{k}+ \\frac{1}{q_{\\mathrm{g}}}\\ , \\frac{2ks}{1+k^{2}s^{2}}\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 in these equations , @xmath24 is afikov s inetic - fluid @xmath0 parameter , @xmath25 is the related stability curve , @xmath26 is the radial wavenumber of the perturbation expressed in dimensionless form , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the stellar and gaseous toomre parameters , and @xmath29 denotes the modified bessel function of the first kind and order zero .    , where @xmath30 and @xmath24 are the fluid - fluid and kinetic - fluid @xmath0 parameters of rafikov ( 2001 ) . in addition ,",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the stellar and gaseous toomre parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath4 are the relevant velocity dispersions of the two components . ]",
    "bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) , elmegreen ( 1995 ) , jog ( 1996 ) , and again rafikov ( 2001 ) adopted a less rigorous , but more straightforward approach : they treated the stellar component as a fluid , with sound speed equal to @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting two - fluid stability criteria are equivalent , apart from the different parametrizations used , because they are based on the same dispersion relation ( jog & solomon 1984a ) .",
    "however , even in this case , rafikov s criterion is simpler and is becoming more and more widely used ( e.g. , leroy et al .",
    "2008 ; robertson & kravtsov 2008 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ; mastropietro et al .",
    "2009 ; ceverino et al .",
    "2010 ; westfall et al .",
    "2011 ; elson et al .  2012 ; watson et al .",
    "2012 ; williamson & thacker 2012 ) . such a criterion can be written as @xmath31 , where afikov s luid - fluid @xmath0 parameter can be computed by maximizing the related stability curve over all radial wavenumbers : @xmath32 @xmath33 what is the accuracy of the two - fluid stability criterion ?",
    "bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) compared the fluid - fluid and kinetic - fluid marginal stability curves in a representative set of cases , and showed that the differences are small ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "rafikov ( 2001 ) carried out a more detailed analysis and got similar results ( see his fig .",
    "however , he did not evaluate the relative error @xmath34 , which depends on @xmath35 and @xmath36 and which is a useful piece of information for assessing the accuracy of @xmath30 .",
    "we do this in fig .  1 .",
    "our contour map shows that such error is less than 7% and has a root - mean - square value of 4% .",
    "this means that @xmath30 and @xmath24 are practically equivalent , since the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath37 are themselves subject to observational uncertainties .    , where @xmath38 is the two - component @xmath0 parameter of romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) , and @xmath24 is the kinetic - fluid @xmath0 parameter of rafikov ( 2001 ) .",
    "the rest of the notation is the same as in fig .  1 .",
    "]    romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) showed that the two - fluid @xmath0 parameter can be accurately estimated without the usual maximization ( or minimization ) procedure : @xmath39 @xmath40 although very recent , such an approximation is already frequently used ( e.g. , cacciato et al .  2012 ; forbes et al .  2012 ; hoffmann & romeo 2012 ; khoperskov et al .",
    "2012 ; meurer et al .  2013 ; zheng et al .",
    "2 shows that @xmath38 is remarkably accurate even with respect to the kinetic - fluid @xmath0 parameter .",
    "in fact , the relative error @xmath41 is below 10% and has a root - mean - square value of 5% .",
    "thus @xmath38 is a faster and physically equivalent alternative to @xmath30 or @xmath24 .        to understand the weaknesses of a two - component analysis , let us see how spiral galaxies populate the parameter plane of star - gas instabilities .",
    "we use a sample of twelve nearby star - forming spirals from things , previously analysed by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) : ngc 628 , 2841 , 3184 , 3198 , 3351 , 3521 , 3627 , 4736 , 5055 , 5194 , 6946 and 7331 . for each galaxy of this sample",
    ", we compute the radial profiles @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and hence the track left by the galaxy in the @xmath44 plane . the result for the whole sample",
    "is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "note that 20% of the data fall within the shaded part of the @xmath44 plane , which represents the condition for star - gas decoupling . in this region , @xmath25 has two maxima : one at small @xmath26 , where the response of the stellar component peaks ; and the other at large @xmath26 , where gas dominates . in the ` stellar phase ' ,",
    "the maximum at small @xmath26 is higher than the other one , and therefore it controls the onset of disc instability .",
    "vice versa , in the ` gaseous phase ' , it is the maximum at large @xmath26 that determines @xmath24 .",
    "the two - fluid counterpart of this region ( thin dashed lines ) is also populated by 20% of the data ( romeo & wiegert 2011 ) . in the rest of the parameter plane ,",
    "the dynamical responses of the two components are strongly coupled and peak at a single wavelength .",
    "the analysis of things spirals carried out above treats the interstellar medium ( ism ) as a single component with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( leroy et al .",
    "what are the limitations of this approach ?",
    "how do hi and @xmath2 contribute to star - gas instabilities ? to answer these questions , we consider hi and @xmath2 separately , and choose observationally motivated values of the 1d velocity dispersion : @xmath47 ( leroy et al .",
    "2008 ) , and @xmath48 ( wilson et al .  2011 ) .",
    "we then compute the @xmath44 tracks for each case ( stars plus hi or @xmath2 ) , and show the results in the right panel of fig .",
    "note that hi and @xmath2 populate the parameter plane differently .",
    "in particular , none of the hi data falls within the two - phase region , while @xmath2 populates such a region in 60% of the cases .",
    "this means that hi and @xmath2 have distinct stability properties , and a fundamentally different dynamical coupling with stars . treating the ism as a single component underestimates the role that @xmath2 plays in star - gas instabilities , and overestimates the contribution of hi",
    "this is why a multi - component analysis is needed !",
    "the only multi - component stability diagnostics that have been available so far are the local axisymmetric stability criteria of morozov ( 1981 ) and rafikov ( 2001 ) , which are valid for infinitesimally thin discs made of gas and @xmath7 stellar components . for @xmath8 , the case considered by morozov ( 1981 ) , such criteria are equivalent because they are based on similar approximations .",
    "however , besides being more general , rafikov s criterion is simpler and can be written as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 @xmath51}{k_{i}}\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath52 @xmath53    let us illustrate how to find a simple , accurate , fast and more general @xmath0 diagnostic . in sect .",
    "2.1 , we have shown that stars can be accurately treated as a fluid when evaluating @xmath0 .",
    "so we can safely replace the kinetic terms in eq .",
    "( 12 ) with their fluid counterparts .",
    "we then face the heart of the problem : how to estimate the least stable wavenumber , @xmath54 , without the usual maximization procedure .",
    "consider the two - component case first , and compare the romeo - wiegert approximation [ eqs ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ] with the two - fluid stability parameter [ eqs ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ] .",
    "one can easily infer that @xmath55 fulfils the following conditions :      conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) have not been pointed out in previous analyses .",
    "they simply mean that @xmath67 is approximately the typical epicycle size of the less stable component .",
    "this approximation is not accurate when @xmath68 and @xmath69 , since for such values there is a transition between three stability regimes and @xmath55 has a jump across one of the interfaces ( see discussion of fig .",
    "note , however , that estimating @xmath55 as above produces a very accurate estimate of @xmath30 , namely the romeo - wiegert approximation .",
    "this is because @xmath30 is continuous across the @xmath70 line , and because the error that affects the estimate of @xmath30 is of second order with respect to that of @xmath55 : @xmath71 .",
    "the first - order term is obviously zero , since the first derivative of @xmath72 vanishes for @xmath73 .",
    "this flow of arguments suggests that we can estimate the @xmath74-component @xmath0 parameter as in the two - fluid case , i.e.  by approximating @xmath67 with the typical epicycle size of the least stable component ( @xmath75 ) : @xmath76 @xmath77 where the index @xmath78 denotes the component with smallest @xmath0 : @xmath79 .",
    "this is the component that dominates the local stability level ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "all other components have less weight ; the more @xmath81 differs from @xmath82 , the smaller the weight factor @xmath83 .    what is the accuracy of @xmath84 ? in appendix",
    "a , we show how estimation uncertainties propagate from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , and derive an upper bound for the resulting root - mean - square error : @xmath85 eq .",
    "( 17 ) tells us that the accuracy of our approximation deteriorates slowly as we consider more and more components . in the case of greatest interest , stars plus",
    "hi plus @xmath2 , the relative error is on average less than 6% , i.e.  almost as low as in the two - component case ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "* _ case 1 : _ rafikov s reference model of the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the epicyclic frequency is @xmath86 .",
    "the surface densities and velocity dispersions of the various components are listed in table b1 . * _ case 2 : _ same as case 1 , but with the velocity dispersion of white and brown dwarfs decreased from 32.5 to 20.0 kms@xmath87 . *",
