    "one of the most successful methods for describing strongly correlated electron systems is the dynamical mean - filed theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism appears to be particularly useful in studying the falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) @xcite , as it enables to get analytical , or high precision numerical results , which become exact in the limit of large dimensions .",
    "most of the findings have been obtained in the high - temperature homogeneous phase @xcite , but the ordered phase was also considered in a few papers @xcite .",
    "the results presented in these papers are remarkable , as they give a clear evidence that the static mean field theory is not an adequate tool for describing correlated electron systems .",
    "indeed , physical quantities obtained using the static and dynamic mean field approach are substantially different one from another .",
    "this discrepancy is particularly clearly demonstrated by hassan and krishnamurthy @xcite , and by matveev , shvaika and freericks @xcite .",
    "both teams analyzed the spinless fkm at half filling in the ordered charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phase having the form of checkerboard phase .",
    "hassan and krisnamurthy @xcite considered the square lattice and the bethe lattice in the limit of infinite dimension and focused mostly on spectral properties , whereas matveev , shvaika and freericks @xcite examined the hypercubic lattice in the limit of high dimensions and they focused mainly on transport properties .",
    "it is quite interesting that even though these studies were performed on different lattices , they lead to similar spectral properties of the model .",
    "namely , in all the cases the energy spectrum has a gap at the fermi level at @xmath1 and with an increase of @xmath5 two additional subbands develop inside the gap in such a way , that the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level becomes positive still in the ordered phase ( above a certain temperature @xmath9 ) , i.e. below the order - disorder transition temperature @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , the energy subbands developing inside the gap in the ordered checkerboard phase were already noticed by freericks and zlati @xcite .",
    "here it is worthy to note that the monte carlo calculations performed on the 2d systems also give results similar to those obtained within dmft @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the data based on the static mean field theory calculations show that the gap disappears only at @xmath11 @xcite . indeed , according to a conventional mean field theory this",
    "gap gradually diminishes with an increase of temperature , but still persists until the cdw phase exists , i.e. until the order - disorder ( o - do ) phase transition temperature @xmath11 is reached @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the same conclusion was also formulated by van dongen , who studied the fkm on the bethe lattice using a different variant of dmft @xcite .",
    "in fact , van dongen derived analytical formulas on the temperature green functions in the ordered phase , but he analyzed them only in the limiting cases of small and large coupling parameter @xmath4 . since in these two limits the gap is always present in the ordered phase , he concluded that it exists for any @xmath4 .",
    "however this is in contradiction to the results reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .    since the demonstration of the existence of the gapless ordered phase in refs .",
    "@xcite is quite surprising , but in the literature still practically unnoticed result , in this contribution we develop studies of the subject .",
    "our purpose is to perform a more detailed analysis of spectral properties of the system focusing mainly on intermediate values of the parameter @xmath4 . following the approach derived by van dongen @xcite we perform non - perturbative calculations that allows us to reconstruct in a simple way the data obtained by hassan and krisnamurthy @xcite and to get analytical expressions for some characteristics of the spectrum not reported before .",
    "in addition , we calculated the electronic part of the specific heat and found that it behaves monotically around the temperature @xmath9 of metal - insulator ( mi ) transformation . hence , we conclude that the transformation is not a phase transition in the usual sense .",
    "our analysis of the single electron energy spectrum of the spinless fkm is based on exact formulas for the temperature - dependent @xmath0 @xmath17 derived for the bethe lattice within a version of the dmft formalism derived by van dongen @xcite .",
    "there are two types of localized particles @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the system , whose densities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , are equal to each other and equal to @xmath22 , ( @xmath23 ) and spinless electrons .",
    "the localized particles may correspond , for example , to two different components of an alloy .",
    "we focus on the half - filling case , when the density of electrons @xmath24 .",
    "then the ground state has the checkerboard - type structure composed of two interpenetrating sublattices @xmath25 and @xmath26 , each of which is occupied only by one type of particle : the sublattice @xmath25 by @xmath18 particles and the sublattice @xmath26 by @xmath19 particles , respectively .",
    "consequently , the density @xmath27(@xmath28 ) of particles @xmath29 on the sublattice @xmath30 is equal to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , whereas the density @xmath33(@xmath34 ) of particles @xmath35 on the sublattice @xmath30 is equal to @xmath12 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "with an increase of temperature the densities @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath37 ) diminish below 1 , while @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( @xmath38 ) increase above 0 and in the disordered phase all these densities are equal to @xmath22 .",
    "then the quantity @xmath39 is equal to 1 at @xmath1 and equal to @xmath12 in the high - temperature , disordered phase , thus it is chosen to be the order parameter .",
    "it turns out that changes of @xmath15 cause significant changes in the @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , some energy states appear within the energy gap if @xmath40 .",
    "if it happens around the fermi level , it corresponds to the mi transformation .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 depends explicitly on the order parameter @xmath15 and its temperature dependence comes out entirely from the temperature dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , the order parameter @xmath41 and the @xmath0 @xmath42 are determined selfconsistently from the following procedure .",
    "first we determine the @xmath15-dependent @xmath0 @xmath43 and from that the free energy @xmath44 .",
    "next we find the temperature dependence of the order parameter @xmath41 from minimization of @xmath44 over @xmath15 .",
    "then , we find the temperature dependent @xmath0 @xmath42 by inserting @xmath41 into @xmath43 . and finally we calculate the internal energy @xmath45 , the energy gap @xmath46 and the value of @xmath0 at the fermi level @xmath47 .    the hamiltonian we use is ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 means the nearest neighbor lattice sites @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52(@xmath53 ) is an annihilation(creation ) operator of itinerant electrons , whereas @xmath54 is their particle number operator .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 is equal to 1/2(-1/2 ) for the lattice site occupied by the particle a(b ) , so the coulomb - type on - site interaction between itinerant electrons and the localized particles amounts @xmath56 .",
    "the hopping electron amplitude @xmath57 we henceforth set equal to one for our energy scale .    we suppose that our results should be relevant to various experimental systems that display charge density or magnetic order such as for example @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( see ref . @xcite and the citations given therein ) or perovskite compounds @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .    in the next section we provide a detailed analysis of the @xmath0 as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath4 and in the section iii",
    "we show the temperature dependence of the @xmath0 . in the section iii",
    "we also discuss the relationship between the o - do and mi transformations and present the phase diagram of the system .",
    "then the existence of a nonzero dos at a characteristic value of @xmath4 is derived within a low temperature expansion on a general bipartite lattice ( sect .",
    "finally , the last section contains some concluding remarks on our findings and a summary .",
    "all physical properties analyzed in this paper are derived from @xmath62 calculated from the laplace transformation of the retarded green function @xmath63 defined for complex @xmath64 with @xmath65 using the standard formula @xmath66 in the remainder of this paper we will sometimes use simplified notations @xmath67 or @xmath68 instead of @xmath69 and @xmath70 instead of @xmath71 , respectively .    for the two sublattice system one",

    "@xmath84    the equation ( [ eq7 ] ) has nontrivial analytic solutions that are significantly different for small and large @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath85 there is no gap in the electronic energy spectrum , whereas for @xmath86 there is the finite gap at the fermi level that increases with @xmath4 .",

    "indeed , according to this theory the process of closing the gap is due to gradual increase in the width of two dos subbands : one lying just below and the other just above the fermi level . as a result ,",

    "[ figure7 ] , is not an artifact of the dmft or the bethe lattice but a general feature of the fk model on any bipartite lattice .",

    "we demonstrate the effect of closing of the energy gap in the @xmath0 in the insulating phase ( for not too large @xmath4 ) and then of increasing of the @xmath0 value at the fermi level in the metallic phase with an increase of degree of disorder .",
    "our results confirm and extend the findings presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the most surprising conclusions drawn from these studies is that an increase of disorder may lead to a closure of the energy gap still before the system transforms into a completely disordered phase . in view of this result , we suggest a re - examination of those experiments , in which transition temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath9 are found to be the same @xcite .",
    "but one should keep in mind that the distinction between @xmath11 and @xmath9 can be difficult to detect in some systems , as a clear difference between these temperatures was found only in a relatively narrow range of values of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "an additional difficulty is that just above @xmath9 the @xmath0 at the fermi level is still small , as only above @xmath9 it begins to rise with temperature , starting from zero and reaching a maximum value at @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect , that one will be able to notice a difference between @xmath169 and @xmath170 only in precise enough experiments .    as we have demonstrated within a low temperature expansion , the results emerging from the dmft calculation on the bethe lattice might be quite general .",
    "the reason is , that the fk model , called by some authors the simplified hubbard model @xcite , contains basic ingredients that are present in many other models of correlated electron system . on the other hand ,",
    "properties of the @xmath0 relevant for these studies , such as existence of the gap in the homogeneous phase for sufficiently large @xmath4 and closing the gap with decreasing @xmath4 in the homogeneous phase but not in the ordered phase , are common for all examined lattices ( hypercubic 1d , 2d , 3d and the infinite d , as well as the bethe lattice in the infinite d limit ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , there are some similarities between our phase diagram displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] and the phase diagram found for the hubbard model with disorder @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can not directly compare our results with those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , as these latter were obtained not for the fk model but for the hubbard model , and only at zero temperature . however , in these two cases the same sort of phases appear on the phase diagram , only insulating phases survive for large @xmath4 and the ordered metallic phase occupies a relatively small region in the phase diagram .",
    "finally , let us hope that the existence of gapless checkerboard - type charge density wave phase found first for the fk model will be confirmed by studies for on the hubbard model and other models of strongly correlated electrons .",
