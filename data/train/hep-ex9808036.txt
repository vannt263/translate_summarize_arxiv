    "the opal detector provides hermetic coverage for electrons and photons for @xmath76  mrad . however , prior to the data collection at  it was possible for a muon in the angular range @xmath67 to escape detection .",

    "is measured to be @xmath77 by using   events in which a minimum ionizing track is observed in sw within the mip plug geometrical acceptance .",
