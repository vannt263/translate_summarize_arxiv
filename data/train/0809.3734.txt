    "here @xmath15 to @xmath16 and @xmath17 over the wmap frequencies , @xmath18 is the projected optical depth due to compton scattering , @xmath19 is the temperature of the intra - cluster gas , and @xmath20=511 kev .",
    "averaged over many isotropically distributed clusters moving at a significant bulk velocity with respect to the cmb , the dipole from the kinematic term will dominate , allowing a measurement of @xmath21 .",
    "thus ka - b suggested measuring the dipole component of @xmath22 .",
    "we use a normalized notation for the dipole power @xmath23 , such that a coherent motion at velocity @xmath21 leads to @xmath24 , where @xmath25k . for reference , @xmath26k . when computed from the total of @xmath27 positions ,",
    "the dipole will also have positive contributions from 1 ) instrument noise , 2 ) the thermal sz ( tsz ) component , 3 ) the cosmological cmb fluctuation component arising from the last - scattering surface , and 4 ) the various foreground components within the wmap frequency range .",
    "the last of these contributions can be significant at the lowest wmap frequencies ( channels k & ka ) and , hence , we restrict this analysis to the wmap channels q , v & w which have negligible foreground contributions . the contributions to the dipole from the above terms can be estimated as @xmath28 at the @xmath27 different cluster locations with polar angle @xmath29 . for @xmath30",
    "the dipole of @xmath31 becomes @xmath32 .",
    "here @xmath33 is the residual dipole produced at the cluster locations by the primordial cmb anisotropies .",
    "the dipole power is @xmath34 .",
    "the notation for @xmath35 is such that @xmath36=@xmath37 correspond to the @xmath38 components , with @xmath39 running perpendicular to the galactic plane towards the ngp , and @xmath40 being the galactic plane with the @xmath41-axis passing through the galactic center .",
    "this dipole signal should not be confused with the `` global cmb dipole '' that arises from our _ local _ motion relative to the cmb .",
    "the kinematic signal investigated here does not contribute significantly to the  global cmb dipole \" arising from only a small number of pixels .",
    "when the latter is subtracted from the original cmb maps , only a small fraction , @xmath42 , of the kinematic signal @xmath43 is removed .",
    "the tsz dipole for a random cluster distribution is @xmath44 decreasing with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "this decrease could be altered if clusters are not distributed randomly and there may be some cross - talk between the monopole and dipole terms especially for small / sparse samples @xcite , but the value of the tsz dipole will be estimated directly from the maps as discussed below and in greater detail in kashlinsky et al ( 2008 - ka - bke ) .",
    "the residual cmb dipole , @xmath45 , will exceed @xmath46 because the intrinsic cosmological cmb anisotropies are correlated . on the smallest angular scales in the wmap data @xmath47k , so these anisotropies could be seen as the largest dipole noise source .",
    "however , because the power spectrum of the underlying cmb anisotropies is accurately known , this component can be removed with a filter described next .    to remove the cosmological cmb anisotropies we filtered each channel maps separately with the wiener filter as follows . with the known power spectrum of the cosmological cmb fluctuations , @xmath48 , a filter @xmath49 in @xmath50-space which minimizes @xmath51 in the presence of instrument noise",
    "is given by @xmath52 , with @xmath53 being the measured power spectrum of each map .",
    "convolving the maps with @xmath49 minimizes the contribution of the cosmological cmb to the dipole .",
    "the maps for _ each _ of the eight wmap channels were thus processed as follows : 1 ) for @xmath54 we adopted the best - fit cosmological model for the wmap data @xcite available from http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov ; 2 ) each map was decomposed into multipoles , @xmath55 , using healpix @xcite ; 3 ) the power spectrum of each map , @xmath53 , was then computed and @xmath49 constructed ; 4 ) the @xmath55 maps were multiplied by @xmath49 and fourier - transformed back into the angular space @xmath56 .",
    "we then removed the intrinsic dipole , quadrupole and octupole .",
    "the filtering affects the effective value of @xmath18 for each cluster and we calculate this amount later .",
    "here we use an all - sky cluster sample created by combining the rosat - eso flux limited x - ray catalog ( reflex ) @xcite in the southern hemisphere , the extended brightest cluster sample ( ebcs ) @xcite in the north , and the clusters in the zone of avoidance ( ciza ) @xcite sample along the galactic plane .",
    "these are the most statistically complete x - ray selected cluster catalogs ever compiled in their respective regions of the sky .",
    "all three surveys are x - ray selected and x - ray flux limited using rass data . the creation of the combined all - sky catalogue of 782 clusters is described in detail by @xcite and ka - bke .",
    "we started with 3-year  foreground - cleaned \" wmap data ( http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov ) in each differencing assembly ( da ) of the q , v , and w bands .",
    "each da is analyzed separately giving us eight independent maps to process : q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 , w1 , ... , w4 .",
    "the cmb maps are pixelized with the healpix parameter @xmath57=512 corresponding to pixels @xmath58 on the side or pixel area @xmath59 sr . this resolution is much coarser than that of the x - ray data , which makes our analysis below insensitive to the specifics of the spatial distribution of the cluster gas , such as cooling flows , deviations from spherical symmetry , etc . in the filtered maps for each da we select all wmap pixels within the total area defined by the cluster x - ray emission , repeating this exercise for cluster subsamples populating cumulative redshift bins up to a fixed @xmath39 . in order to eliminate the influence of galactic emission and non - cmb radio sources ,",
    "the cmb maps are subjected to standard wmap masking .",
    "the results for the different masks are similar and agree well within their statistical uncertainties .",
    "the sz effect ( @xmath60 , the electron density ) has larger extent than probed by x - rays ( x - ray luminosity @xmath61 ) , which is confirmed by our tsz study using the same cluster catalogue ( akke ) . as shown in akke , ka - bke contributions to the tsz signal are detected out to @xmath62 .",
    "what is important in the present context , is that the x - ray emitting gas is distributed as expected from the @xmath1cdm profile @xcite scaling as @xmath63 in outer parts . in order to be in hydrostatic equilibrium",
    "such gas must have temperature decreasing with radius @xcite . indeed , the typical polytropic index for such gas would be @xmath641.2 , leading to the x - ray temperature decreasing as @xmath65 at outer radii .",
    "this @xmath19 decrease agrees with simulations of cluster formation within the @xmath1cdm model @xcite and with the available data on the x - ray temperature profile @xcite . for such gas ,",
    "the tsz monopole ( @xmath66 ) decreases faster than the ksz component ( @xmath67 ) when averaged over a progressively increasing cluster area . to account for this",
    ", we compute the dipole component of the final maps for a range of effective cluster sizes , namely @xmath68 \\theta_{\\rm x - ray}$ ] and then the maximal cluster extent is set at @xmath69 to avoid a few large clusters ( eg . coma )",
    "bias the dipole determination .",
    "we note that at the final extent our clusters effectively have the same angular radius of 0.5@xmath70 .",
    "our choice of the maximal extent is determined by the fact that the sz signal is detectable in our sample out to that scale ( akke ) , which is @xmath71(3 - 4)mpc at the mean redshift of the sample .",
    "increasing the cluster radius further to 1@xmath72 , causes the dipole to start decreasing with the increasing radius , as expected if the pixels outside the clusters are included diluting the ksz signal ( ka - bke ) .    to estimate uncertainties in the signal only from the clusters",
    ", we use the rest of the map for the distribution and variance of the noise in the measured signal .",
    "we use two methods to preserve the geometry defined by the mask and the cluster distribution : 1 ) @xmath27 central random pixels are selected outside the mask away from the cluster pixels adding pixels within each cluster s angular extent around these central random pixels , iteratively verifying that the selected areas do not fall within either the mask or any of the known clusters .",
    "2 ) we also use a slightly modified version of the above procedure in order to test the effects of the anisotropy of the cluster catalog . there",
    "the cluster catalog is rotated randomly , ensuring that the overall geometry of the cluster catalog is accurately preserved .",
    "both methods yield very similar uncertainties ; for brevity , we present results obtained with the first method .",
    "[ fig : c1 ] summarizes our results averaged over all eight da s .",
    "we find a statistically significant dipole component produced by the cluster pixels for the spheres and shells extending beyond @xmath73 .",
    "it persists _ as the monopole component vanishes _ and its statistical significance gets particularly high for the @xmath74-component .",
    "the signal appears only at the cluster positions and , hence , can not originate from instrument noise , the cmb or the remaining galactic foreground components , the contributions from which are given by the uncertainties evaluated from the rest of the cmb map pixels .",
    "the signal is restricted to the cluster pixels and thus must arise from the two components of the sz effect , thermal and/or kinematic .",
    "the tsz component , however , is given by the monopole term at the cluster positions and can not be responsible for the detected signal .",
    "for the largest apertures it vanishes within the small , compared to the measured dipole , statistical uncertainty , and yet the dipole term remains large and statistically significant .",
    "this is the opposite of what one should expect if the dipole is produced by the tsz component .",
    "any random distribution , such as tsz emissions , would generate dipole @xmath75 which can never exceed ( and must be much less than ) the monopole component of that distribution , @xmath76 . on the other hand , any coherent bulk flow would produce dipole @xmath77 , which is bounded from below by the amplitude of the motion . furthermore , we find significant dipole from ( at least ) @xmath78=0.035 ( 135 clusters ) all the way to @xmath78=0.11 ( 674 clusters ) ; its parameters do not depend on the numbers of clusters , pixels used etc .",
    "any dipole component arising from the tsz term would depend on these parameters as it reflects the ( random ) dipole of the cluster sample and should thus decrease as more clusters are added in spheres out to progressively larger @xmath39 . to verify this ,",
    "we compute the expected monopole and dipole terms produced by the tsz effect using the parameters of our cluster catalog as discussed in ka - bke and recover the monopole term fairly accurately when the @xmath79-profile assumption is reasonable .",
    "the tsz dipole component is then a small fraction of the monopole term .",
    "when normalized to the remaining monopole term in fig .",
    "[ fig : c1]a it is completely negligible compared to the measured dipole .",
    "further , the tsz dipole becomes progressively more negligible as more clusters are added in at higher @xmath39 , and its direction varies randomly reflecting the random nature of the intrinsic cluster sample dipole on these large scales .",
    "all this is contrary to what we measure .",
    "we thus conclude that the dipole originates from the ksz effect due to the bulk flow of the cluster sample .",
    "our results indicate a statistically significant bulk - flow component in the final filtered maps for cluster samples in the @xmath39-bins from @xmath800.05 to @xmath810.3 corresponding to median depth to @xmath820.1 , and it also persists when the dipole in shells is computed selecting only clusters at @xmath830.12 ( the median redshift for this sub - sample is @xmath50.18 ) .",
    "[ fig : c1]e shows that the bulk flow results in a cmb dipole with little variation - within the statistical uncertainties - between @xmath84 and @xmath40.12 .",
    "the monopole component reflects the residual tsz contribution which is very small for the maximal cluster aperture as fig .",
    "[ fig : c1]a shows .",
    "( at lower @xmath39 there may still be some residual tsz component , which would be consistent with the more nearby clusters having a larger _ angular _ sz extent than the more distant ones ) .    to translate the cmb dipole in @xmath6k into @xmath21 in km / sec",
    ", we generated cmb temperatures produced by the ksz effect for each cluster and estimate the dipole amplitude , @xmath85 , contributed by each 100 km / sec of bulk - flow ( ka - bke ) .",
    "the results are shown in the last column of table 1 of ka - bke for the central values of the direction of the measured flow ; within the uncertainties of @xmath86 they change by at most a few percent . a bulk flow of 100 km / sec leads to @xmath87k for unfiltered clusters assuming the @xmath79-model ; this corresponds to an average optical depth of our cluster sample of @xmath88 expected for a typical galaxy cluster . for nfw clusters",
    "the value of @xmath85 would be _ smaller_. filtering reduces the effective @xmath18 by a factor of @xmath89 .",
    "since a @xmath79-model provides a poor fit to the measured tsz component outside the estimated values of @xmath90 , we compute @xmath85 within that aperture where the central value of the bulk - flow dipole has approximately the same value as at the final apertures . due to the large size of our cluster sample ( @xmath91130 - 675 ) , the random uncertainties in the estimated values of @xmath85 should be small , but we can not exclude a systematic offset related to selection biases affecting our cluster catalog at high @xmath39 .",
    "such offset , if present , will become quantifiable with the next version of our x - ray cluster catalog ( in preparation ) using the empirically established sz profile rather than the current @xmath79-model to parameterize the cluster tsz .",
    "the good agreement between the various tsz - related quantities shown in ka - bke for @xmath92=@xmath90 and the observed values for both unfiltered and filtered maps suggests , however , that these systematic uncertainties are likely to be small .",
    "they only affect the accuracy of the determination of the amplitude of the bulk flow , but not its existence established by the cmb dipole at the cluster locations .",
    "since the filtering removes @xmath18 in the outskirts of clusters more effectively , a larger amount of power is removed in the @xmath79-model when the cluster sz extent is increased beyond @xmath90 , than in the steeper profile measured by akke .",
    "thus the effective @xmath18 is possibly underestimated by using a @xmath79-model , but it can not exceed ( and must be much less than ) the calibration obtained from the unfiltered @xmath79-model .",
    "conventionally , the entire peculiar velocity field is assumed to be driven by the peculiar gravitational potential . for a given cosmological model",
    ", the details of the velocity field also depend on the window function of the dataset . constructing the precise window function",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper , but the overall conclusions would be insensitive to its details because the amplitude and coherence length of the measured flows are quite unexpected within the concordance @xmath1cdm model .",
    "[ fig : c1]f shows the rms prediction , @xmath93 , of the concordance @xmath1cdm model .",
    "if produced by gravitational instability within the concordance @xmath1cdm model , the motion would require the local universe out to @xmath94mpc to be atypical at the level of many standard deviations of the model .",
    "indeed a value of @xmath95k is required to reach peculiar velocities of order 100 km / sec on the relevant scales .",
    "this is much greater than @xmath85 deduced from the _ unfiltered _ x - ray data and even then it would be difficult to explain the approximate constancy of the measured dipole with depth .",
    "cosmic variance does not change these conclusions significantly . for a gaussian density field",
    "the peculiar velocity distribution on linear scales is maxwellian , with the probability density of measuring a 1-d bulk velocity @xmath96 .",
    "the probability of finding a region with @xmath97 is then @xmath98=@xmath99 where @xmath100 is the incomplete gamma - function normalized to @xmath101=1 .",

    "km / sec at @xmath103mpc , so 95% of cosmic observers should measure bulk flow velocities less than ( 240,180 ) km / sec at these scales .",
    "to make these numbers consistent with our measurements - at these scales alone - would require @xmath104k .",
    "this is much higher than even the calibration values for unfiltered data ( computed for the @xmath79-model which leads to a _ larger _",
    "@xmath85 value than the nfw - profile clusters ) and can not be accounted for by any systematic uncertainties in our calibration procedure .",
    "indeed , the distribution of errors is approximately gaussian ( see fig . 5 of ka - bke ) , so the probability of measuring velocity @xmath105 at scale @xmath106 is @xmath107 dv$ ] ( e.g. gorski 1991 ) .",
    "the probability of several such independent measurements is the product of @xmath108 s ; for the numbers plotted in fig .",
    "1f this probability is completely negligible .",
    "( the measurements in fig .",
    "1f are not strictly independent since each subsequent @xmath39-bin also contains the clusters from the previous bin ; nevertheless each @xmath108 is so small that the overall probability is still negligible ) .",
    "the coherence length of the measured bulk flow shows no signs of convergence out to @xmath109mpc , and it is quite possible that it extends to much larger scales , possibly all the way across our horizon .",
    "an interesting , if exotic , explanation for such a  dark flow \" would come naturally within certain inflationary models . in general",
    ", within these models the observable universe represents part of a homogeneous inflated region embedded in an inhomogeneous space - time . on scales much larger than the hubble radius",
    ", pre - inflationary remnants can induce tilt including cmb anisotropies generated by the grischuk - zeldovich @xcite effect @xcite .",
    "these can arise from the parts of space - time that inflated at different times and rates and would manifest themselves mainly in the quadrupole component , @xmath110 : an inhomogeneity of amplitude @xmath111 at a distance @xmath112 generates a quadrupole @xmath113 .",
    "consistency with the observed low value of @xmath110 would require a sufficiently large number of the inflation s e - foldings , making the universe flat to within @xmath114 and causing the scale of inhomogeneity @xmath115 to become comparable to the curvature radius ( @xmath116 ) @xcite .",
    "such a tilted universe would lead to a uniform flow across the observed horizon due to the density gradient produced by this superhorizon mode .",
    "the bulk motion would have an amplitude of @xmath117 and would not generate a primordial dipole cmb component @xcite . since the quadrupole produced by such a pre - inflationary remnant is @xmath118 , it is possible for such inhomogeneities to generate the required motions and be consistent with the observed value of @xmath110 and flatness .",
    "although it would require accidental alignment , the contribution from such an inhomogeneity to cmb anisotropies via the gz effect might , interestingly , also explain the observed low value of the cmb quadrupole ( and possibly also octupole ) compared to the concordance @xmath1cdm model .",
    "this explanation for the measured bulk flow would , however , still require peculiar velocities generated by gravitational instability acting on the @xmath1cdm density field , which would provide a random component around the uniform bulk flow . on sufficiently large scales ,",
