    "quantum secret sharing ( qss ) has attracted a lot of attention recently as an important primitive for protecting quantum information .",
    "qss , originally proposed as a means to protect classical information using laws of quantum physics @xcite , has developed into a general theory describing a secure transmission of quantum information to a group of parties ( players ) , not all of whom can be trusted .",
    "the collaboration of the players is essential in order to recover the quantum information .",
    "this general approach to qss is the quantum analogue of classical secret sharing @xcite .",
    "a qss protocol involves a dealer who holds a secret state ( quantum information ) @xmath0 , encodes it into an entangled state @xmath1 over @xmath2 quantum sub - systems ( shares ) and distributes the shares to @xmath2 players .",
    "the encoding is done in such a way that only specified subsets of the players ( the access structure ) are able to extract the secret while all other subsets ( forming the adversary structure ) are unable to learn anything about it .",
    "the reconstruction of the secret by the collaborating players is then achieved by applying a suitable joint unitary operation on their shares , which disentangles one share from all the others and yields the secret state .    among qss protocols , there is an important class of so - called @xmath3 threshold schemes @xcite , in which the access structure consists of all groups of @xmath4 or more players while there are @xmath2 players in total .",
    "this makes the protocol `` fair '' in the sense that no player is favored among others .",
    "the simplest threshold scheme is the @xmath5 scheme where there are only two players and both have to collaborate to retrieve the secret .",
    "the implementation of this scheme is , in general , very simple .",
    "the dealer only needs to interfere the quantum secret on a beam splitter with a noisy beam , each player receiving one of the outputs .",
    "it is impossible to obtain any information about the secret state through operations on either share independently due to the contamination of the noisy beam .",
    "the secret can be perfectly reconstructed , however , if the players co - operate by interfering their shares on another 1:1 beam splitter .    a continuous variable ( 2,3 ) qss threshold schemes has been proposed by tyc and sanders @xcite .",
    "this scheme uses electromagnetic field modes , and employs interferometers for both the encoding and decoding of the secret . in this paper",
    ", we extend the original proposal by tyc and sanders and introduce another more practical scheme that utilizes an electro - optic feedforward technique .",
    "we consider the secret to be encoded on the sideband frequency quadrature amplitudes of a light beam .",
    "ideally the dealer would employ a perfectly entangled pair of beams .",
    "this is in practice impossible , however , improvement over classical schemes can still be achieved with finite amounts of entanglement .",
    "moreover we will show that the introduction of classical noise by the dealer can further improve the qss scheme .",
    "we compare and quantify the performances of both schemes in terms of available input entanglement using two measures .",
    "we use the fidelity between input and output states as a figure of merit .",
    "we also characterize qss in terms of the signal transfer coefficients and the conditional variances of both conjugate quadrature amplitudes of the secret .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in section",
    "[ sec : scheme ] we present the dealer protocol to generate three shares .",
    "we outline , in section  [ sec : comp ] , the central role of the optical parametric processes in the qss schemes .",
    "we then present the two secret sharing schemes in section  [ sec : expt ] and characterize these schemes in section  [ sec : char ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : production ] shows the dealer protocol of a ( 2,3 ) threshold qss scheme as proposed by tyc and sanders @xcite . the dealer employs a pair of entangled beams to encode the secret by interfering one of them with the secret state on a 1:1 beam splitter .",
    "we let @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the annihilation operators corresponding to the secret and the two entangled beams , respectively .",
    "the linearized expression for the annihilation operator is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the steady state component and zero mean value fluctuations of the annihilation operator , respectively .",
    "the amplitude and phase quadrature operators are denoted as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , whilst the variance of these operators is expressed in the frequency domain as @xmath14^{2}\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the annihilation operators corresponding to the three shares are then given by @xmath15 similar to the ( 2,2 ) secret sharing scheme discussed earlier , players 1 and 2 ( henceforth denoted by \\{1,2 } ) only need to complete a mach - zehnder interferometer with the use of a 1:1 beam splitter to retrieve the secret state .",
    "the output beams of the mach - zehnder are described by @xmath16 eq .",
    "( [ reconst12 ] ) clearly shows that the the secret is perfectly reconstructed .",
    "in contrast , secret reconstructions for \\{2,3 } or \\{1,3 } require more complex protocols .",
    "the paper now focuses on experimental alternatives for the implementation of this reconstruction process .",
    "one of the important element for qss is the optical parametric down conversion process . in this process",
    "a pump photon is converted into a pair of twin photons following the simple scheme : @xmath17 , where the signal and idler modes are denoted @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "this down conversion can be achieved in a bulk type ii second order non - linear crystal in a traveling wave configuration . by treating the pump as a classical beam",
    ", we find the input - output relations for the signal and idler annihilation operators to be @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the annihilation operators of the signal and the idler modes , respectively .",
    "the interaction parameter is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is proportional to the pump field amplitude and the second order susceptibility coefficient of the crystal . by choosing @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be the @xmath27 polarized modes defined by @xmath28 and assuming that all the power is carried by mode @xmath25 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : twopaasevol ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : twopaaievol ] ) give @xmath29 from which we can deduce the total number of photons at the output @xmath30 with gain @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the phase mismatch between the pump and the @xmath25 mode . the gain",
    "@xmath33 oscillates between the two values @xmath34 and @xmath35 , depending of the relative phase between the input and the pump beam .",
    "finally we note that the output quadrature amplitudes are given by @xmath36      another way of performing the optical parametric down conversion process is by using a type i crystal . optical parametric oscillators ( opo ) operating below threshold",
    "can exhibit phase sensitive amplification @xcite .",
    "we assume the opo is a simple fabry - perot cavity with a second order non - linear gain medium .",
    "the equations of motion for a general opo cavity are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the inputs into the front and back mirrors and @xmath40 is a vacuum fluctuation term due to loss in the cavity .",
    "@xmath41 is the total cavity damping rate , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the damping rates of the front and back mirrors and the loss in the cavity respectively .",
    "the output from the opa expressed in terms of an input @xmath38 can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : opa1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : opa2 ] ) . by setting @xmath45 and @xmath46 , so that no vacuum fluctuation couple into the cavity , the output field quadratures from the opa expressed in the frequency domain are @xmath47 where the general operator @xmath48 is the fourier transform of the time operator @xmath49 . by assuming",
    "the frequency is small such that @xmath50 , the output field quadratures can be expressed more succinctly as @xmath51 where the gain is defined as @xmath52 .",
    "the amount of gain is dependent on the pump power , and on the relative phase between the pump and input beams . in the amplification regime phase",
    "squeezed light is produced , whilst in the deamplification regime amplitude squeezed light is produced .      for type ii systems , the signal and idler output modes generated by a single psa , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twopaasevol ] ) and ( [ eq : twopaaievol ] ) , exhibit quadrature entanglement @xcite .",
    "since the two modes are orthogonally polarized , the entangled beams can be spatially separated using a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "whilst for type i systems , quadrature entangled beams can be produced by interfering a pair of squeezed beams produced by two opas on a 1:1 beam splitter @xcite .",
    "the output beams from the beam splitter also will exhibit quadrature entanglement .",
    "the entanglement between the @xmath53 and @xmath54 quadratures of the output modes in both systems can be characterized by using the inseparability criterion proposed by duan _",
    "_ @xcite . for symmetric inputs , duan s inseparability criterion",
    "is given by @xmath55 where subscripts @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the two entangled beams . since @xmath58 for both configurations ,",
    "the beams show quadrature entanglement when @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the squeezing parameter of the input beams for type i , or the interaction parameter for type ii ) .",
    "in this section , we analyze how \\{2,3 } can reconstruct the secret sent by the dealer . the method described here",
    "can also be applied unchanged to \\{1,3 } , and so we will not cite explicitly this case in the following paragraphs .    first , one can remark that by performing homodyne measurement on @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and then by combining their results with a well chosen gain , \\{2,3 } can get a measure of the amplitude or the phase of the secret , but they can not measure both at the same time . this scheme can be used for practical applications which require only classical information of a single quadrature to be transfered between the dealer and the players . since the secret is not reconstructed , nor quantum information of both quadratures transferred , this protocol does not qualify as qss .",
    "let us now concentrate on schemes which effectively reconstruct both the amplitude and phase of the secret at the same time .",
    "this scheme follows the original idea of tyc and sanders @xcite .",
    "to reconstruct the secret using two psas , \\{2,3 } first combine @xmath61 and @xmath62 on a 1:1 beam splitter , producing two beams @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2opa2 - 3 ] .",
    "they pass each of these beams though separate psas , denoted by @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "both the psas are adjusted so that the output of @xmath67 is amplified in the @xmath68 quadrature and deamplified in the @xmath69 quadrature whilst the @xmath66 output is deamplified in the @xmath68 quadrature and amplified in the @xmath69 quadrature .",
    "the gain of both psas is assumed to be equal .",
    "the final step required for reconstruction of the secret is to combine both psa outputs on another 1:1 beam splitter .",
    "we denote these outputs as @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the psas can be used in both configurations discussed in section  [ sec : comp ] .",
    "we find the output quadrature amplitudes for both configurations to be of the form@xmath72 it is obvious that if output 1 is used to construct the secret , then output 2 will in the limit of perfect qss contain no relevant information",
    ". we will therefore not analyse output 2 . for the type ii configuration ,",
    "the @xmath73 and @xmath74 parameters are dependent on the interaction parameters of the parametric process    @xmath75 { x}^{\\pm}_{s,\\rm in}\\\\ \\label{eq : twbeta } \\beta^\\pm & = & \\left [ \\sqrt{g}\\!\\left(\\!\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cosh r\\!-\\!\\frac{1}{2}\\sinh r\\!\\right)\\!-\\!\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{g}}\\!\\left(\\!\\frac{1}{2}\\sinh r\\!+\\!\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cosh r\\!\\right ) \\right ] { x}^{\\pm}_{i,\\rm in}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the type i configuration , they are dependent on the amount of squeezing of both squeezed state inputs .",
    "we therefore obtain@xmath76    in the case of perfect entanglement ( i.e. @xmath77 ) , setting the parametric gain to @xmath78 will completely eliminate the contribution of the input entanglement modes .",
    "we are therefore left with the original secret . with imperfect entanglement",
    ", we find for the type ii configuration @xmath79 similarly , the output quadrature amplitudes for the type i configuration are given by @xmath80 where it is assumed that @xmath81 are the squeezed quadratures .",
    "the results above demonstrate that with finite entanglement , \\{2,3 } are able to reconstruct the secret @xmath82 with added noise variance of @xmath83 .",
    "in addition to the parametric processes required for the generation of a pair of entangled beams , the qss scheme described above requires two additional psas .",
    "this is experimentally very challenging .",
    "since non - linear effects in optics are small , there have been methods used to increase optical intensities in experiments to enhance the parametric process .",
    "one such example is the utilization of high peak power pulsed light sources , either in q - switched or mode - locked setups , to single pass light beams through the non - linear mediums to achieve the required phase sensitive amplification .",
    "a common difficulty found in such systems is the distortion of optical wave fronts due to the non - linear medium .",
    "this would result in poor optical interference and losses .",
    "another method of increasing optical intensity in non - linear processes is the use of optical resonators . in this situation",
    ", the resonators also act as mode cleaners to the beams , thus ensuring better beam quality .",
    "however , impedance matching of the resonators , which is not required for single - pass phase sensitive amplification , is difficult to achieve .",
    "imperfect impedance matching again leads to losses .",
    "it is therefore interesting to find an alternative scheme which does not require additional parametric processes for the reconstruction of the secret . in the next section",
    ", we will present a qss scheme that requires only an electro - optic feedforward loop for \\{2,3 } in secret reconstruction .",
    "electro - optic feedforward loops have been widely used in many continuous variable experiments .",
    "the feedforward setup has been demonstrated to be useful in noiseless control of light beams @xcite and has recently been used in teleportation experiments @xcite . in our feedforward qss scheme , the dealer is required to add classical noise on the entangled beams .",
    "the purpose of adding classical noise will be discussed in the characterization section  [ sec : char ] .",
    "this can be achieved using a pair of phase modulators on the constituent amplitude squeezed beams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff2 - 3b ] .",
    "this results in the two entangled beams having anticorrelated classical noise in the amplitude quadratures and correlated classical noise in the phase quadratures . due to the 1:1 beam splitter ratio ,",
    "both beams have an equal amount of added noise .",
    "the shares can then be expressed as@xmath84 where @xmath85 are the additional classical noise introduced by the two phase modulators .",
    "the strength of these additional modulations is given by @xmath86 .",

    "we note that the @xmath88 reflective beam splitter ensures that the phase quadrature of the secret is already faithfully reconstructed in @xmath91 . by measuring the amplitude fluctuations @xmath92 and applying them to @xmath93 ,",
    "it is possible to eliminate the remaining anti - squeezed fluctuations , @xmath94 , and the classical amplitude noise @xmath95 on the same beam .",
    "this can be done simply by directly detecting beam @xmath96 and then electro - optically feeding the detected signal to the amplitude of beam @xmath64 with the right gain .",
    "due to optical losses , however , better efficiency can be achieved by divorcing the modulators from beam @xmath64 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff2 - 3b ] .",
    "instead the detected signal from beam @xmath96 is encoded off line on a strong local oscillator beam , @xmath97 .",
    "the signal on the local oscillator can then be mixed back onto beam @xmath64 using a highly reflective beam splitter as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff2 - 3b ] .",
    "the resulting output quadratures are given by @xmath98 .",
    "in the limit of high beam splitter reflectivity , @xmath99 , we obtain@xmath100 where @xmath101 is a gain transfer function which takes into account the response of the electro - optic feedforward circuit and the loss due to the hr beam splitter .",

    "the output quadrature fluctuations can be re - expressed as @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the total gain of the feedforward loop . by setting @xmath108 ,",
    "it is clear that the anti - squeezing and classical noise terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffxout2 ] ) are cancelled . in the limit of perfect detection efficiency and large squeezing ,",
    "we obtain @xmath109 hence \\{2,3 } can reproduce a symplectically transformed version of the secret , @xmath82 .",
    "we note that since symplectic transformations are local unitary operation , no quantum information contained in the secret state is lost .",
    "thus , the feedforward scheme works equally well when compared with the 2psa scheme in terms of quantum information transfer . in order to reconstruct the quantum state of the secret ,",
    "however , a single psa is required on the output beam .",
    "even so , the feedforward scheme is still technically less demanding than the 2psa scheme introduced in the earlier section . in the next section",
    ", we will introduce experimental measures to characterize both qss schemes .",
    "in teleportation experiments _ fidelity _ , @xmath110 , is conventionally used to quantify the efficacy of a teleporter @xcite .",
    "fidelity can also be adopted to characterize qss as it is a protocol that reconstructs input quantum states at a distance .",
    "if we assume that all input noise sources are gaussian and that the secret is a coherent state , the fidelity of a qss scheme is given by @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "assuming an ideal detector ( @xmath113 ) , we obtain from the analysis of section  [ sec : expt ] the theoretical limits of fidelity for the 2psa scheme as a function of squeezing @xmath114 where the subscripts @xmath57 and @xmath115 in @xmath116 denote the collaborating players .",
    "we note that @xmath117 is always unity since the reconstruction of secret only requires a simple mach - zehnder . in the limit of perfect entanglement , @xmath118 , the fidelity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelity2 ] ) also approaches unity . in the case of the feedforward qss scheme , however ,",

    "in fact , it quickly degrades to zero for finite squeezing and large secret sideband modulations .",
    "the reason for this is due to the symplectically transformed secret output state @xmath123 .",
    "we point out , however , that no information is lost . indeed",
    "\\{2,3 } can locally transform the output to get back the original secret state via a single parametric process . the fidelity given in eq .",

    "when the amount of input squeezing less than 42% , single players obtain more quantum information than the access structures using the feedforward protocol .",
    "in this situation , the collaborating players should directly measure their shares containing the secret . the classical limit obtained when",
