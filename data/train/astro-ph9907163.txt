    "this paper is the second in a series describing the observations of `` young massive star clusters '' ( ymcs ) in a number of nearby spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "a general outline of the project was given by larsen & richtler ( @xcite , paper1 ) , and some first results were presented there . in this paper",
    "the data reductions are discussed in more detail , with special emphasis on two software tools developed as part of the project , which may be of general use to the astronomical community .",
    "these tools are * mksynth * , a programme which generates synthetic images with realistic noise characteristics , and * ishape * which derives intrinsic shape parameters for compact objects in a digital image by convolving an analytic model profile with the psf and matching the result to the observed profile .    by ymcs we mean objects of the same type as e.g. the cluster ngc  1866 in the large magellanic cloud ( fischer et al .",
    "they are characterised by being similar ( with respect to mass and morphology ) to globular clusters seen in the milky way , but of much lower ages - in fact , the lower age limit of the clusters in our sample is set only by the fact that we avoid objects located within hii regions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the observations are described in sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , and sect .",
    "[ sec : red ] is a discussion of the basic data reduction procedure including the standard calibrations . in sect .",
    "[ sec : tools ] the tools * mksynth * and * ishape * are introduced , and sect .",
    "[ sec : compl ] gives a discussion of the completeness corrections used in paper1 .",
    "finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : resolv ] * ishape * is used to derive radii of the clusters , and some implications of the results are discussed .",
    "observations of 21 nearby galaxies , listed in table 1 of paper1 , were carried out with the danish 1.54 m. telescope and dfosc ( danish faint object spectrograph and camera ) at the european southern observatory ( eso ) at la silla , chile , and with the 2.56 m. nordic optical telescope and alfosc ( a dfosc twin instrument ) , situated at la palma , canary islands .",
    "the data consist of ccd images in the filters u , b , v , r , i and h@xmath0 . in the filters bvri and h@xmath0 we typically made 3 exposures per galaxy of 5 minutes each , and 3 exposures of 20 minutes each in the u band .",
    "v - band images of the galaxies are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : im1 ] and [ fig : im2 ] .",
    "both the alfosc and dfosc were equipped with thinned , backside - illuminated 2 k@xmath1 loral - lesser ccds .",
    "the pixel scale in the alfosc is 0.189/pixel and the scale in the dfosc is 0.40/pixel , giving field sizes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the seeing during the observations at la silla was typically around 1.5 arcseconds as measured on v - band frames .",
    "on the images taken with the not the seeing was usually about 0.8 arcseconds .",
    "all observations used in this paper were conducted under photometric conditions .    during each observing run , photometric",
    "standard stars in the landolt  ( @xcite ) fields were observed for calibration of the photometry .",
    "care was taken to include standard stars over as a wide a range in colours as possible , usually from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "some of the landolt fields were observed several times during the night at different airmass in order to measure the atmospheric extinction coefficients . for the flatfielding we used skyflats exposed to about half the dynamic range of the ccd , and in general each flatfield used in the reductions",
    "was constructed as an average of about 5 individual integrations , slightly offset with respect to each other in order to eliminate any stars .",
    "the initial reductions of all ccd images ( bias subtraction , flatfield correction , removal of bad columns ) were done using the standard tools in iraf .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes for the standard stars were obtained on the ccd images using the * phot * task in daophot ( stetson @xcite ) with an aperture radius of 20 pixels .",
    "the extinction correction was then applied directly to the raw instrumental magnitudes .",
    "the standard calibrations were carried out using the * photcal * package in iraf with the transformation equations assumed to be of the linear form        .",
    "the standard transformation coefficients for each of the four observing runs .",
    "@xmath7 is the total number of observations of individual stars used for the transformations .",
    "the number of stars @xmath8 actually involved is always smaller , some of the fields being observed several times .",
    "the rms values refer to the scatter around the standard transformations .",
