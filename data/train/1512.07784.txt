    "the created particles are responsible for reheating the universe at the end of this stage . because of the inflation stage brought temperature of the universe below for the requirement of thermo nuclear reactions , therefore the reheating stage was necessary for the nucleosynthesis process .",
    "the people have many studies about the reheating process but until now it is not well - known . in the literatures  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite the behaviour of the inflation and reheating stages",

    "the reheating temperature ( @xmath5 ) with general range @xmath16 mev@xmath17 gev  @xcite and @xmath6 are very important and give us valuable information about the reheating stage .",

    "note that , if we do not consider quantum normalization , the zero point energy must be removed or else the cosmological constant would be 120 orders of magnitude more than observed . therefore based on this point , we think that one can remove this discrepancy by determining of the appropriate parameter @xmath6 provided it dose not exceed the condition @xmath18 , and also the obtained spectral energy density is not more than level @xmath19 due to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "hence the obtained temperatures based on the calculated @xmath6 are in favour of both slow roll and initial condition of quantum normalization .",

    "the reheating temperature under slow - roll inflation and quantum normalization ( eqs.([uyuu ] , [ r ] ) ) is very sensitive to the @xmath6 .",
    "these conditions are very important for the early universe and we must pay attention to obtain the suitable @xmath6 under these conditions .",
    "otherwise there will be some problems such as discrepancy of @xmath5 as mentioned in @xcite due to some unsuitable @xmath6 like @xmath6=1 .",
    "therefore in case of the slow - roll inflation is correct condition , due to this discrepancy the author in  @xcite has believed that the quantum normalization in eq.([r ] ) may not be a good initial condition .",
