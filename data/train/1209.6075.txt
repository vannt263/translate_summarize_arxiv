    "the variation of nuclear ground - state shapes is governed by the modification of the shell - structure of single - nucleon orbitals . far from the valley of @xmath1-stability ,",
    "the energy spacings between single - nucleon levels change considerably with the number of neutrons and/or protons .",
    "the reduction of spherical shell closure is often associated with the occurrence of deformed ground states and , in many cases , with the phenomenon of coexistence of different shapes in a single nucleus .",
    "a quantitative description of the evolution of nuclear shapes , including regions of short - lived exotic nuclei that are becoming accessible in experiments at radioactive - beam facilities , necessitate accurate modeling of the underlying microscopic nucleonic dynamics .",
    "major advances in nuclear theory have recently been made in studies of complex shapes and the corresponding excitation spectra and electromagnetic decay patterns , especially in the framework of nuclear energy density functionals ( edfs )  @xcite .",
    "a microscopic , edf - based description of complex collective excitation spectra usually starts from a constrained hartree - fock plus bcs ( hfbcs ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculation of the binding energy surface with the mass multipole moments as constrained quantities .",
    "the static nuclear mean - field is characterized by symmetry breaking : translational , rotational and particle number . even though symmetry breaking incorporates important static correlations ( e.g. , deformations and pairing )",
    ", the static self - consistent solution can only provide an approximate description of bulk ground - state properties such as masses and radii .",
    "modeling excitation spectra and transition rates in the edf framework necessitates a systematic treatment of dynamical effects related to restoration of broken symmetries and fluctuations in collective coordinates .",
    "one possible approach to five - dimensional quadrupole dynamics that restores rotational symmetry and allows for fluctuations around triaxial mean - field minima is to formulate a collective hamiltonian , with deformation - dependent inertia parameters determined by microscopic self - consistent mean - field calculations .",
    "the dynamics of the collective bohr hamiltonian is governed by the vibrational inertial functions and the moments of inertia  @xcite . for these quantities either the gaussian overlap approximation of the generator coordinate method ( gcm - goa ) ( yoccoz masses  @xcite ) or the adiabatic time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( atdhfb ) expressions ( thouless - valatin masses  @xcite ) can be used .",
    "the thouless - valatin masses have the advantage that they also include the time - odd components of the self - consistent mean field and , in this sense , the full dynamics of a nuclear system .",
    "this can be seen most clearly in the case of translational motion , where the thouless - valatin mass corresponds to the exact mass @xmath2 of @xmath3 nucleons  @xcite , whereas the gcm method produces the exact value only when the center of the mass velocity is also included as the generator coordinate  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the thouless - valatin masses is often simplified by adopting the cranking formulas  @xcite that neglect the residual interaction . in that case",
    "the thouless - valatin corrections are usually taken into account by scaling the inertia parameters with an empirical factor ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .    in this work we present an efficient method to calculate the thouless - valatin moments of inertia for the nuclear system .",
    "the method is based on the rapid convergence of the expansion of the inertia matrix .",
    "the accuracy of the proposed method is verified in the rotational case by comparing the results with the exact thouless - valatin moments of inertia calculated using the self - consistent cranking model .",
    "the proposed method is computationally much more efficient than the full atdhf calculation , yet it retains a high accuracy of the order of @xmath0% .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the adiabatic time - dependent hartree - fock theory . a more detailed exposition of this formalism can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "the aim of the atdhf theory is to derive in a fully microscopic and consistent way a hamiltonian for the description of collective phenomena in which many nucleons act coherently .",
    "the theory is based on two approximations : i ) in the tdhf one assumes that the many - body time - dependent wave function of the system is a slater determinant at all times ; and ii ) in the adiabatic approximation the collective motion is slow compared to single - particle motion and , therefore , the collective kinetic energy is a quadratic function of the velocities .    to identify the components of the density matrix that correspond to the coordinates and momenta of the collective hamiltonian",

    "this basis depends on time because @xmath6 is a function of time .    in the adiabatic approximation",
    "it is assumed that the total density @xmath8 of the system is always close to the density @xmath6 , that is , the matrix @xmath14 that introduces the time - odd components remains small at all times .",

    "this means that we are able to generate a subset of time - even slater determinants , characterized by the parameters @xmath46 , with the following property : the solution of the atdhf problem will always remain within this subset of slater determinants . in other words , we have found a path @xmath47 $ ] from which we can calculate the velocity @xmath48 next we define the operator @xmath49 with the relation : @xmath50 \\ ; , \\ ] ] and obtain the following expression for the kinetic energy : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the real collective mass tensor @xmath53    to evaluate @xmath54 , we have to invert the matrix @xmath55 in eq .",

    "we decompose the matrix into a diagonal part containing the energies of particle and hole states @xmath56 and the residual interaction @xmath57 , and use the fact that the interaction matrix elements are in most cases much smaller than the @xmath18-energies .",
