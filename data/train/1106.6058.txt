    "the prisoner s dilemma is a paradigmatic model for interactions among agents where strategies leading to either individual gain ( defection ) or the common good ( cooperation ) are in competition . in politics , economics , and in finance",
    ", an individual s actions may be regarded as cooperation or defection .",
    "sometimes , the choice of a strategy ( whether to cooperate or defect ) is affected by direct reciprocity but other times , the choice of strategy is affected by the performance of players in the game .",
    "previous research has focused on how direct reciprocity in a repeated game ( i.e. , trust between connected individuals ) can affect the evolution of strategies @xcite . alternatively , players performance may affect their goals and future choice of strategies .",
    "for example , direct reciprocity can not capture altruistic or selfish behavior .",
    "therefore , a problem of interest is understanding , when the players are coupled in some complex way over a network , how their strategies evolve in time , based on their performance in the game .",
    "this is the subject of the current paper .",
    "evolutionary game theory studies how players strategies evolve when the game is iterated in time .",
    "here we consider that the agents are coupled over a complex network and that the game is played between each agent and his / her direct neighbors over the network .",
    "an important difference with previous literature is that our analysis is based neither on a population level analysis nor on a mean field approximation ; instead , we are interested in how a specific network structure affects the evolution of strategies , and in particular the fixed points of the dynamics and their stability . for a review on evolutionary games on networks , see @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", much research effort has been devoted to studying the structure and dynamics of complex networks ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a full understanding of how the specific network structure affects the evolution of strategies for models in evolutionary game theory is lacking . here",
    "we present a unified analytical treatment which holds for diverse networks including those with random , scale free , and degree - correlated topologies .    in the literature on game theory ,",
    "a distinction is commonly made between pure and mixed strategies . in the first case",
    ", players are allowed to choose from a finite set of alternatives ( e.g. , in the case of two strategies , either defection or cooperation ) . in the second case",
    ", each player is allowed to choose a strategy in a continuum range , e.g. , @xmath0 $ ] , with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) representing pure defection ( pure cooperation ) . in a probabilistic framework ,",
    "a mixed strategy equal to @xmath3 corresponds to cooperating @xmath4 of the time and defecting @xmath5 of the time . in many real social situations ,",
    "mixed strategies are common , as rarely an individual is observed to behave as a cooperator ( defector ) all of the time .",
    "it is also reasonable to expect that mixed strategies will sometimes be convenient , as they allow a player to hedge against the risk of choosing a pure strategy ( in the same way as diversifying a portfolio reduces the risk of an investment ) . in what follows",
    ", we will consider a network of coupled agents , each of which can choose a strategy in a continuum of values between pure defection and pure cooperation .",
    "agents are then able to update their individual strategy based on the interactions with the neighbors .",
    "pure strategies are eventually recovered as particular cases of mixed strategies ( i.e , @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) .",
    "hence , the pure strategies lie on the boundary of the mixed strategies . as a result of this",
    ", we will see that pure strategies play a particular role ( qualitatively different ) in the dynamics . in what follows ,",
    "we introduce a model for the evolution of strategies that we analyze .",
    "the main features of our model are the following : i ) it is payoff driven ; ii ) each agent has limited information on the other players strategies .",
    "below we describe points i ) and ii ) in more detail .",
    "\\i ) most of the ongoing research on evolutionary game theory focuses on situations where the agents are equal , i.e. , they respond in the same way when presented with the same stimulus .",
    "however , this assumption is unrealistic . in this paper",
    ", we model a situation where each node s choice of strategy depends on an internal parameter that may differ from node to node .",
    "we want this parameter to evolve with time based on the interactions with the other players .",
    "we consider that each individual s choice of strategy depends on his / her degree of success in playing the game ; specifically , we consider that the level of accumulated payoff at each node becomes a relevant parameter . as motivation , we note how , in social contexts , the behaviors of individuals are highly correlated with their social status ; also , in economics _ powerful agents / players _ are usually more competitive than weaker ones .",
    "maslow s theory of motivation @xcite ranks human needs in a hierarchy ( usually represented as a pyramid ) and argues that as each lower need is satisfied , the next higher level becomes more compelling , i.e. , there is a shift in the perception of the relevant needs at each level of the hierarchy . in what follows",
    ", we will incorporate this feature in our model of an iterated game , i.e. , once the accumulated payoff of player @xmath6 exceeds a threshold , this will have an effect on the choice of strategy of @xmath6 .",
    "\\ii ) most of the current research in evolutionary game theory considers that individuals choose their strategy based on knowledge of other players strategies .",
    "however , this assumption is unrealistic . in this paper",
    ", we consider a situation in which knowledge about other players strategies may be unavailable , while we assume that each player has knowledge of his / her neighbors payoffs .",
    "these assumptions apply to those situations in which the strategies that players adopt are hidden or undeclared . for example",
    ", we may expect that in certain situations a defector may be reluctant to openly declare his / her strategy .",
    "note that if information on the payoffs is available , this can provide indirect evidence of the strategies adopted by the players ; i.e. , for example , if a neighbor is driving a ferrari , this might indicate that he or she must be a strong cooperator or a strong defector ; but which one would be the right guess ? to conclude , our model presents both these characteristics : it is payoff - driven and it does not presume knowledge of the other players strategies .",
    "as such , it aims at encompassing certain sources of complexity that characterize real - world situations . given our model ,",
    "we are able to carry out a stability analysis that is highly dependent on the specific network structure and provides a unified framework to study the effects of different network features , such as random , scale free , and degree - correlated topologies .    in sec .",
    "ii we present our model for the evolution of strategies of coupled agents over a network . in sec .",
    "iii we classify the fixed points of the dynamics in fully mixed strategies and polarized strategies and we present a stability analysis that gives a simple condition on the eigenvalues of a relevant matrix .",
    "the role of the underlying network topology on stability is considered in sec .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we consider a network of coupled agents ( nodes ) playing the prisoner s dilemma game .",
    "each node @xmath7 is characterized by a strategy @xmath8 in the closed interval @xmath0 $ ] , where the strategy @xmath8 represents the probability that player @xmath6 behaves as a cooperator over a large number of interactions ( @xmath9 is the probability that player @xmath6 behaves as a defector ) .",
    "the case of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) corresponds to a _ pure strategy _ , in which player @xmath6 is always a defector ( respectively , a cooperator ) .",
    "we refer to all the remaining cases , i.e. , @xmath12 , as _ mixed strategies_. we assume that the game is played very frequently so that at our resolution we are unable to assess whether agent @xmath6 behaves as a cooperator or a defector at any given interaction , but only the average number of times that it acts as a cooperator , i.e. , the frequency @xmath8 , which we regard as the _ state _ of node @xmath6 .",
    "hence we assume to only have access to the probability @xmath8 ( while information about whether a node behaves as a cooperator or defector at any given interaction remains unavailable ) , and we regard @xmath8 as the _ state _ of node @xmath6 . over many interactions , individuals may occupy any position in the range of probabilistic defector / cooperator behavior when considering their record of behavior .",
    "we consider that the evolution of the strategies is governed by the nodes payoffs , where the payoff of node @xmath6 is determined by its strategy and those strategies of the nodes that are connected to it . in the prisoner s dilemma ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a cooperator incurs a cost @xmath13 for each connection that he or she has .",
    "if a cooperator is connected to another cooperator , the benefit of that connection is @xmath14 .",
    "so , if a cooperator is connected to @xmath15 individuals and @xmath16 of them are cooperators , the payoff for that cooperator is @xmath17 .",
    "typically , @xmath18 . for a defector , there is no cost associated with any connection , and if the defector is connected to @xmath19 cooperators , the defector s payoff is @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the network structure could be directed and weighted and is described by the adjacency matrix @xmath21 , where @xmath22 if @xmath23 is connected to @xmath6 , @xmath1 otherwise .",
    "this yields the following definition of the payoff for a player @xmath6 , @xmath24+(1-\\sigma_i)b \\sum_j a_{ij } \\sigma_j = b \\sum_j a_{ij}\\sigma_j - c   \\sum_j a_{ij } \\sigma_i=\\sum_j a_{ij } ( b \\sigma_j -c \\sigma_i ) , \\label{pay}\\ ] ] or in matrix notation , @xmath25 where @xmath26 $ ] is the vector of payoffs , @xmath27 $ ] is the vector of strategies , and @xmath28 is a diagonal matrix , such that @xmath29 .",
    "again , @xmath30 in ( [ pay ] ) is the average payoff of node @xmath6 over a large number of interactions with its neighbors , when its strategy and those of the neighbors are given by fixed @xmath31 s .",
    "we allow the strategies adopted by each node / player to evolve in time ; thus we write @xmath32 , where @xmath33 represents continuous time .",
    "our basic assumption is that each node updates its strategy based on its payoff and the payoffs of its neighbors ( note we do not make the assumption that nodes know the strategies of their neighbors .",
    "indeed , that knowledge could be unavailable ) . with this information ,",
    "player @xmath6 can compute the relative payoff , @xmath34 , \\label{u}\\ ] ] with a positive ( negative ) value of @xmath35 indicating that node @xmath6 is performing better ( poorly ) with respect to its neighbors .    from ( [ payvec],[u ] ) , we obtain , @xmath36 where @xmath37 $ ] , and the matrix @xmath38 is defined as , @xmath39    from ( [ central ] ) we now see that the relative payoff of node @xmath6 can be written as a linear combination of the strategies , i.e. , @xmath40 , @xmath7 .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath38 encodes information of both the network structure ( i.e. , the matrix @xmath41 ) and the choice of the parameters of the game ( i.e. , the two scalars @xmath14 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "we will show that the eigenvalues of this matrix control stability of a fixed set of strategies . we aim at formulating a simple , general model for the evolution of the strategies @xmath42 , evolving from @xmath43 , that fulfils the following requirements ,    \\(i ) the pure strategies @xmath44 are fixed points for the dynamics , as @xmath45 can not decrease below @xmath1 or exceed @xmath2 .",
    "\\(ii ) the dynamics admits other fixed points for values of @xmath46 , corresponding to mixed strategies in the spectrum of possibilities between complete cooperation and complete defection .",
    "\\(iii ) the stability of the fixed points [ ( i),(ii ) ] depends on an internal adaptive parameter at each node ( which we label @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) whose evolution is governed by the interactions with the neighboring nodes . under specific conditions , @xmath47 is a measure of the _ wealth _ of @xmath6 , i.e. , the accumulated _ payoff _ at node @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that when @xmath47 exceeds a threshold , this will affect the choice of strategy of @xmath6 .    with these conditions in mind ,",
    "we write the following set of differential equations ,    [ d ] @xmath49    @xmath7 . equation ( [ de ] ) determines the evolution of the strategies , where @xmath50 , @xmath47 is the adaptive parameter , whose evolution is specified by eq .",
    "( [ de2 ] ) .",
    "here , @xmath47 is the @xmath51 node s internal parameter that models the player s changing attitude toward his neighbors .",
    "the evolution of @xmath52 is forced by the input @xmath53 , through the coupling function @xmath54 that we require be continuous and strictly monotonically increasing / decreasing with @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , @xmath47 is simply the integral of @xmath57 , the relative payoff of node @xmath6 , over time , and as such it represents the _ relative wealth _ of node @xmath6 ( see ( iii ) above ) . here , again , the word _ relative _ , means with respect to node @xmath6 s neighbors .",
    "we wish to emphasize that from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , our model is payoff - driven ( it evolves based on a comparison of the payoff between node @xmath6 and its neighbors ) and does not presume knowledge at node @xmath6 of its neighbors strategies @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 determines the stability of the fixed points of eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) . the differential equation ( [ de ] )",
    "has three fixed points : @xmath60 .",
    "the form of ( [ de ] ) is such that for any initial condition @xmath43 , the trajectories are constrained to lie in the closed interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "we now evaluate stability of the fixed points of ( [ de ] ) , when the values of @xmath47 are fixed .",
    "this is summarized in fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath61 , the pure strategies @xmath44 are unstable , while the mixed strategy @xmath62 is stable . for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) ,",
    "the fixed point @xmath2 is stable and the fixed point @xmath1 is unstable ( the fixed point @xmath2 is unstable and the fixed point @xmath1 is stable ) .     for any occurrence of @xmath47 .",
    "note that the stability of the fixed points @xmath62 for @xmath65 and for @xmath66 is in brackets as these equilibria are never observed if @xmath43 . on the right",
    ", we have a graphical representation of the stability of the fixed points of eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) for different values of @xmath47 , where open circles represent unstable fixed points and filled circles represent stable ones . from top to bottom , we show the cases of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    when @xmath47 increases ( decreases ) above 1 ( below 0 ) , it affects the stability of the fixed points of eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "specifically , for @xmath56 , when @xmath47 exceeds ( goes below ) a threshold , this results in a qualitative change of the behavior of @xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to a transition from one level to another of the maslow s pyramid of needs , resulting in a change of the individual s attitude ( and , as a consequence , his / her strategy ) .    in our numerical simulations to follow , we choose the following form for the function @xmath54 , @xmath69 @xmath70 . with this choice",
    ", @xmath47 can still be seen as the wealth accumulated at node @xmath6 but with a saturation on the maximum increment or decrement that is allowed .",
    "there are many possible situations in which gains and losses are typically bounded . as an example , consider a taxation system that charges a tax on capital gains , while capital losses are tax - deductible .",
    "the form of the function @xmath54 in ( [ f ] ) is consistent with the observation that favorable ( unfavorable ) conditions often foster cooperative ( defective ) behavior @xcite ( e.g. , empirical studies have found a positive correlation between the level of cooperation and the payoff for players participating in a prisoner s dilemma experiment @xcite ) .",
    "however , we wish to emphasize that the results that we present in this paper ( and in the particular , the stability analysis of sec .",
    "iii ) are , to a great extent , independent of the specific choice of the function @xmath54 . on another note ,",
    "we observe that the function @xmath54 describes how the relative payoff influences the strategy adoption , hence it defines an _ imitation function _ as defined in ref .",
    "in this section we consider the stability of the fixed points of eqs .",
    "( [ d ] ) , when the parameters @xmath47 are not fixed ( i.e. , the individual systems @xmath7 are coupled ) .",
    "we first look for fixed points @xmath71 of the dynamics for eqs .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "a candidate fixed point @xmath72 may include both pure and mixed strategies for different nodes , i.e. , for some @xmath6 s @xmath73 , and for the remaining @xmath6 s , @xmath74 .",
    "we refer to a fixed point for which @xmath75 , for all @xmath7 as a _ fully mixed strategy _ , otherwise , we refer to it as a _",
    "polarized strategy_.    in what follows , without loss of generality , we assume that for any equilibrium point , the indices @xmath6 are labeled so that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , @xmath80 . with this relabeling",
    ", we note that the equations ( [ de ] ) , @xmath77 , are decoupled from the corresponding equations ( [ de2 ] ) , @xmath77 .",
    "it follows that the first @xmath81 equations ( [ d ] ) drive the last @xmath82 equations ( [ d ] ) .",
    "thus we define any set of strategies to be a fixed point @xmath71 if the following conditions are met : ( i ) eqs .",
    "( [ de ] ) are set to zero for @xmath77 and ( ii ) eqs .",
    "( [ de],[de2 ] ) are simultaneously set to zero for @xmath80 ( @xmath83 , @xmath80 ) .",
    "given a vector of strategies , @xmath84 , we would like to derive conditions on this vector that identify it as a fixed point . conditions ( i ) are always satisfied if @xmath85 for all @xmath77 . conditions",

    "otherwise , ( [ sis ] ) is an inhomogeneous system ( case ( b ) ) and it admits one and only one solution , provided that @xmath90 is invertible , i.e. , @xmath97 . fully mixed strategies ( for which @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) are included in case ( a ) has at least one zero eigenvalue .",
    "therefore there is at least one eigenvector in the null subspace of the matrix @xmath38 , other than the null vector @xmath100 . ] .",
    "we consider @xmath43 , which constrains @xmath45 to be in the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "a vector in @xmath96 does not necessarily have to represent a set of physical strategies .",
    "for example , for a given matrix @xmath90 , it is possible that there are vectors in @xmath96 that have both positive and negative entries . then , even with the multiplicative constant that we are allowed for eigenvectors , it might be impossible to rescale all entries of such vectors into the range @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "thus , in order for @xmath91 to be a physically meaningful equilibrium for the set of equations ( [ de ] ) , @xmath80 , it has to satisfy the additional requirement ( iii ) that : for case ( a ) , all the entries of @xmath91 have the same sign ( i.e. , they are all positive or all negative ) and , for case ( b ) , the entries of the vector @xmath101 are in the interval @xmath102 . for the remainder of the paper , we assume the dimension of @xmath96 to be @xmath2 ; in which case , the single zero eigenvector @xmath103 of @xmath90 is the basis for @xmath96 .",
    "then any vector @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a fixed point but not necessarily physical .",
    "we see that the system of equations ( [ d ] ) behaves as a multistable system for which the final attractor depends on the choice of the initial conditions . here",
    ", we include a stability analysis for the fixed points of ( [ d ] ) , i.e. , for points @xmath106 that satisfy the above conditions ( i),(ii ) , and ( iii ) .",
    "we already know that the first @xmath81 equations ( [ de ] ) are decoupled from the others and admit only one stable equilibrium ( if @xmath1 is stable , @xmath2 is unstable , and viceversa ) .",
    "therefore , in order to study stability of an equilibrium @xmath106 , we need to linearize eqs .",
    "( [ de2 ] ) , for @xmath80 , about @xmath106 ( with @xmath107 ) ,    [ delta ] @xmath108    @xmath80 , where , since @xmath109 , we have that @xmath110 .",

    "[ a1a ] ) and polarized strategies ( the fixed point observed in fig .",
    "[ a1b ] ) are substantially different .",
    "in particular , there are two main qualitative differences between the two ,    1 .",
    "fully mixed strategies are fixed points for which the payoffs are equal at all the network nodes , while polarized strategies are fixed points for which the payoffs are uneven .",
    "fully mixed strategies are sensitive to the form of the network and the parameters of the game .",
    "therefore it is possible to adjust / control a fully mixed strategy by changing the network connections and/or the parameters of the game .",
    "however , for polarized strategies , there are some players whose strategies can not be changed , and thus the full state can not be adjusted .",
    "fully mixed strategy represent a fair situation , in which all the nodes achieve equal payoffs , regardless of their location in the network . on the other hand ,",
    "polarized strategies represent an unfair situation , in which the nodes payoffs vary according to their respective locations in the network .",
    "therefore , it becomes important to understand how parameters of the game and variability of the networks yield stability of the fully mixed strategy .",
    "the effects of varying the parameter @xmath14 ( benefit of mutual cooperation ) on stability of the fully mixed strategy are reported in fig .",
    "4 . figure 4(a ) shows the result of evolving the network in fig .",

    "2 , 3 and 4 is that by increasing the benefit to cost ratio @xmath162 , the fully mixed state may be destabilized .",
    "for example , in fig .  3 ( @xmath134 larger than @xmath133 , shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , the fully mixed strategy is replaced by a stable polarized strategy , for which some of the nodes converge on the pure cooperator state and some on the pure defector state .",
    "our interpretation of this phenomenon is the following .",
    "fully mixed strategies are equilibria that arise in the presence of a balance between the benefit of being connected to a cooperator @xmath14 and the cost of cooperating @xmath13 .",
    "the benefit to cost ratio @xmath162 affects stability of these equilibria , i.e. , for a low ratio ( @xmath162 ) they are stable and for a large ratio , they are unstable .    .",

    "we analyze how the underlying network structure can affect stability of fully mixed strategies . in particular , we analyze how the range of stability @xmath161 , defined as the width of the @xmath14-range ( see fig .  4(a ) ) associated with stability of the fully mixed state , varies for different network topologies .",
    "we consider the case of symmetric network topologies , i.e. , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , for which the eigenvalues @xmath165 of the matrix @xmath38 are real ( see appendix b ) .",

    "the form of the degree distribution is an important property of the structure of a network .",
    "however , many other distinctive properties have been uncovered to characterize the structure of real networks in more detail , such as the formation of communities of strongly interconnected nodes , frequently detected in many real networks @xcite , or particular forms of correlation or mixing among the network vertices @xcite .",
    "one measure of mixing is the correlation among pairs of linked nodes according to some properties at the network nodes .",
    "a very simple case is degree correlation @xcite , in which vertices choose their neighbors according to their respective degrees .",
    "nontrivial forms of degree correlation have been experimentally detected in many real - world networks , with social networks being typically characterized by assortative mixing ( which is the case where vertices are more likely to connect to other vertices with approximately the same degree ) and technological and biological networks by disassortative mixing ( which takes place when connections are more frequent between vertices of different degrees ) . in ref .",

    "specifically , we show that disassortative networks ( i.e. , @xmath172 negative ) are characterized by a larger range of stability for the fully mixed strategy @xmath161 than their assortative counterparts .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a fully deterministic nonlinear model of an evolutionary game on a network , for which players are allowed to pick a strategy in the interval @xmath0 $ ] , with @xmath1 corresponding to defection , @xmath2 to cooperation , and intermediate values representing mixed strategies in which each player may act as a cooperator or a defector over a large number of interactions with a certain probability .",
    "our model is payoff - driven and it does not presume knowledge of the other players strategies . instead , we consider that strategies evolve based on a comparison of each player s payoff with those of his / her neighbors .",
    "we remove the unrealistic assumption that all the players are equal and assume that their choice of strategy depends on a parameter that takes into account the previous history of the game ( in terms of payoffs ) . under these assumptions",
    ", we find that fixed points of the dynamics may correspond to either one of two qualitatively different states : _ fully mixed strategies",
    "_ , i.e. , fixed points for which all the strategies are mixed and the payoffs are equal at different nodes , or _ polarized strategies _ , i.e. , fixed points for which at least one node is a full cooperator or defector and the payoffs are unequal at different nodes .",
    "we derive a simple condition that relates the network structure and the parameters of the game to stability of such fixed points , which provides a unified framework to study the effects of different network features , such as random , scale free , and degree - correlated topologies .",
    "this information can be used to predict which network / game combinations promote mixed versus polarized behavior .    in our simulations we choose a specific form for the function @xmath54 , which is consistent with the assumption that cooperative behavior arises when the accumulated payoff exceeds a given threshold .",
    "such a choice is supported e.g. , by empirical studies that have found a positive correlation between the level of cooperation and the payoff for players participating in a prisoner s dilemma experiment @xcite .",
    "also , a natural interpretation of our proposed update mechanism is provided by maslow s motivational theory @xcite that assumes that an individual s goals change according to whether certain basic needs are satisfied or not . in the language of game theory",
    "this corresponds to assuming that individuals start caring about the common good ( cooperation ) after they have consolidated their individual gain ( defection ) .",
    "however , our stability analysis is independent of the specific choice of the function @xmath54 and is valid over a broad range of possible functions @xmath54 .",
    "we present a stability analysis for fixed points of eqs .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "we reduce the high - dimensional stability problem ( [ delta ] ) in the low - dimensional form of eq .",
    "( [ systemi ] ) , which depends on the eigenvalues of a relevant matrix .",
    "these eigenvalues reflect the structure of the underlying network ( i.e. , the matrix @xmath41 ) and the choice of the parameters of the game ( i.e. , the two scalars @xmath14 , and @xmath13 ) .",
    "similar reductions in a low - dimensional form have been proposed to evaluate ( i ) the stability of the synchronous evolution for networks of coupled oscillators @xcite , ( ii ) the stability of the consensus state in networks of coupled integrators @xcite , ( iii ) the stability of discrete state models of genetic control @xcite , and ( iv ) the response of networks of coupled excitable systems to stochastic stimuli @xcite .",
    "our computations provide evidence of the fact that for networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution ( scale free ) or networks with low connectivity , most games played will support the emergence of polarized strategies",
    ". however , for networks with a homogeneous degree distribution or networks with high connectivity , it is more likely that strategies will be mixed .",
    "we have also considered the effects of the network degree correlation and found that disassortative networks are characterized by a larger range of stability @xmath161 than assortative networks .",
    "thus if we are given certain characteristics of a network ( e.g. , connectivity , the degree distribution , or the degree correlation ) , we may be able to determine whether polarized or mixed strategies will arise from the dynamics .",
    "alternatively , if we are given a game on a network , we may be able to modify the network to preferentially select polarized or mixed strategies depending on our application .",
    "one surprising observation is that making the benefit @xmath14 larger than the cost @xmath13 may destabilize the mixed strategy state , with some players converging on the pure cooperator and some on the pure defector state .",
    "this suggests that policies governing dynamics on a network should consider the implications of making the benefit of cooperation too high .",
