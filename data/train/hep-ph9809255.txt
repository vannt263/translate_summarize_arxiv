    "the quark model has enjoyed so much success as a qualitative guide to hadronic structure that the discovery that only about @xmath5 of the proton s spin could be attributed to quark spin came as a surprise . since the quark model remains unjustified within qcd , it is a misnomer to call this ",
    "proton spin surprise \" the  proton spin crisis \" .",
    "however , whatever we call it , this result has generated much very productive experimental and theoretical activity .    while in general the spin of the proton",
    "could reside on any mixture of its quark and gluon constituents or in their orbital angular momenta , a conservative interpretation @xcite of the current situation is that the valence quarks carry the spin expected by the quark model but that the low @xmath6 sea of @xmath7 pairs is negatively polarized . in this case",
    "@xmath8 ( defined to be twice the expectation value of the quark plus antiquark spin along the spin direction of a polarized proton , so that @xmath9 would saturate the proton spin ) , when decomposed into its valence and sea components , would be @xmath10 where @xmath11 is twice the spin on the valence quarks and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , twice the spin on the sea quarks and antiquarks of flavor @xmath14 .",
    "if the valence quarks were in nonrelativistic @xmath15-waves as in the naive quark model , then @xmath16 would be unity .",
    "however , as has been appreciated for nearly thirty years @xcite , in realistic valence quark models lower components of quarks spinors convert about @xmath17 of the quark spin into orbital angular momentum so that @xmath18 .",
    "if in addition each of the three light quark flavors carries @xmath19 , a very modest per flavor effect , @xmath20 would follow .",
    "sea quark polarizations of just this sign and magnitude have recently been obtained in a realistic model of @xmath7 pair creation @xcite .",
    "( in a more general context , such small @xmath21 values are perfectly consistent with a @xmath22 expansion of qcd ( where sea quarks appear at order @xmath22 _ via _ quark - antiquark loops ) .",
    "note that the condition @xmath23 , not how accurately @xmath16 approximates unity , determines the applicability of the @xmath24 expansion : any nonzero @xmath21 would lead to a  spin crisis \" as @xmath25 ( the number of light flavors ) tends to infinity . )    in the conservative scenario just described , both the @xmath26 relativistic quenching of spin from @xmath27 and the negative polarization of @xmath21 are compensated by orbital angular momentum .",
    "in general , however , we are only guaranteed that @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the quark and antiquark orbital angular momentum and @xmath30 is the total angular momentum residing in the gluonic fields ) , so major experimental efforts are planned to measure the component parts of eq .",
    "( 2 ) in an effort to disentangle the  spin crisis \" .",
    "these efforts begin with planned extensions of deep inelastic lepton scattering measurements of the proton and neutron spin structure functions down to very small @xmath6 to complete the integrals required to calculate @xmath8 , and studies of the @xmath31-dependence of spin structure functions to make inferences about @xmath32 , the gluon helicity contribution to @xmath33 .",
    "major efforts are also planned to directly measure @xmath32 based on helicity - dependent gluon - parton cross sections .",
    "in addition to these classical inclusive measurements , flavor - tagging semi - inclusive experiments are planned to measure separately @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and also the quark contributions @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "( note that it is not possible to experimentally separate the quark contributions @xmath40 and @xmath41 from @xmath42 and @xmath43 : this separation is conceptual only . )",
    "additional complementary information on the @xmath44 content of the proton is expected from planned measurements of the electric and magnetic form factors @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the @xmath47 current using parity - violating electron - nucleon elastic scattering .",
    "_ given the substantial effort being devoted to this problem , it is surprising that we still do not know whether our original simple picture of the spin structure of the valence quarks is right ! _ to some degree this is because this question is not well - defined : in contrast to other methods ( _ e.g. _ , qcd sum rules @xcite ) , the quark model is not normally embedded in a field - theoretic framework . as a result , there are many difficulties in making comparisons between the  predictions \" of the quark model and the precisely defined quantities measured in deep inelastic scattering . as two illustrations of such difficulties ,",
    "i note that : 1 ) the separation of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is @xmath31-dependent ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath48 might be small at low @xmath31 but very important at large @xmath31 ) and , as mentioned above , 2 ) the @xmath49 and @xmath50 contributions to @xmath51 and @xmath52 can not be disentangled from those to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "however , beyond @xmath55 , sea quarks and antiquarks are scarce and , since gluons are too , such intrinsically field - theoretic issues as the factorization scheme dependence of @xmath56 associated with the gluon anomaly @xcite may be neglected .",
    "thus while the integral values @xmath57 and @xmath58 can not be checked , those fractions of the distributions @xmath59 and @xmath60 extending beyond @xmath55 may be compared with valence quark model expectations with a residual ambiguity associated only with their @xmath31 evolution .",
    "although in what follows i will imagine distribution functions devolved to the  quark model scale \" @xmath61 gev@xmath62 , given this residual ambiguity i will avoid predictions of the @xmath6-dependence of distribution functions and focus instead on the polarization asymmetries @xmath63 and @xmath64 which depend only on ratios of distribution functions and which should therefore have minimal @xmath31-dependence .",
    "it is unfortunate that the current experimental situation for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 leaves much to be desired ( see figs .",
    "1 ) : it is even consistent with the naive @xmath66 predictions .",
    "what are the valence quark model predictions for the resulting polarization asymmetries @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the valence region ? ignoring @xmath67 evolution , they are @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the unpolarized valence distribution functions which integrate to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . from these formulas",
    "it is clear that the predictions depend on knowing the interplay between the valence quark spin and momentum wavefunctions so that there can be no unique prediction of the valence quark model for these asymmetries .",
    "however , i will argue here that its predictions are sufficiently well - determined that they can be used to answer the simple question of whether the valence spin structure is  normal \" or not .    aside from this observation , there is little in this paper that could not be extracted from earlier work on this subject to which i will refer below .",
    "however , the results of this earlier work vary widely since they are based on diverse methods of dealing with relativistic internal quark motion , various prescriptions for boosting to the infinite momentum frame , _ ad hoc _ versus dynamical origins for the assumed @xmath66-breaking , potential _ versus _ bag models , and choices of quark masses . here",
    "i will _ assume _ that the hyperfine interaction is responsible for the @xmath74 ratio as @xmath2 , and then normalize predictions for the valence quark spin distribution functions to the data on this ratio .",
    "in doing so , i will not only avoid much model dependence , but also most of the pitfalls discussed above associated with not knowing precisely how to embed the quark model in field theory .",

    "the body of this paper builds up to these predictions in steps . in the next section",
    "i will review the naive @xmath66 predictions and then modify them within the context of @xmath66 by allowing the quarks to have relativistic internal motions .",
    "i then describe the breaking of @xmath66-symmetric quark spin distributions in the hyperfine - perturbed quark model and close with a brief historical overview .",
    "i begin by recalling that in @xmath79 one may simply write @xmath80 @xmath81 where since @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the antisymmetric color and symmetric @xmath84 spatial wavefunctions , @xmath85 is the unique spin-@xmath86 wavefunction which is symmetric in the first two quarks as required by the pauli principle @xcite . in the nonrelativistic @xmath66 quark model one",
    "therefore expects @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the universal @xmath66 distribution function associated with @xmath92 .",
    "these distributions lead to the standard @xmath66 predictions @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "when the relativistic quenching mentioned above @xcite is turned on , it creates an @xmath6-dependent probability which we denote by @xmath97 for a spin up ( down ) quark to be flipped to down ( up ) .",
    "this reshuffling of probability leads to the ",
    "relativistic @xmath66 \" spin distributions @xmath98 v_{su ( 6 ) } ( x)\\ ] ] @xmath99 v_{su ( 6 ) } ( x)\\ ] ] @xmath100 v_{su ( 6 ) } ( x)\\ ] ] @xmath101 v_{su ( 6 ) } ( x)\\ ] ] where with the nucleon expectation value @xmath102 , the integrated valence spins become @xmath103 @xmath104 so that the  relativistic @xmath66 \" spin distributions satisfy the bjorken sum rule",
    ". however , among other problems , the ",
    "relativistic @xmath66 \" model still makes the incorrect prediction @xmath93 .",
    "note that the model also predicts that @xmath1055/9 $ ] and @xmath95 as @xmath2 , which , since @xmath106 as @xmath2 , is not obviously wrong ( see fig .",
    "since the zeroth - order nucleons are pure @xmath15-waves , in the hyperfine - perturbed quark model @xcite , only the fermi contact part of the hyperfine interaction ( the @xmath107 force responsible for the @xmath108 mass splitting ) is operative in perturbing the nucleon s energy in first order . what does this perturbation do ? in the nucleon rest frame , quark pairs with spin 1 have their energies raised ( as in the @xmath109 ) while pairs with spin zero have their energies lowered .",
    "since @xmath110 has the two @xmath49 quarks in a pure spin one state , while each @xmath111 pair is in a mixture of spin one and spin zero ( with spin zero dominant so that the net perturbation in a nucleon decreases its energy ) , up quarks acquire higher average energy than down quarks . this physics",
    "then immediately suggests that the neutron will have a negative charge radius and that @xmath74 will vanish as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "since the individual spin components of @xmath110 are _ not _ in an eigenstate of the hyperfine interaction , it is less obvious what the effects are on the spin - dependent distribution functions .",
    "these effects are encoded in the @xmath84 component of the hyperfine - perturbed wavefunction @xmath112\\ ] ] where @xmath113 are mixed symmetry wavefunctions of the permutation group @xmath114 which are antisymmetric ( @xmath115 ) and symmetric ( @xmath116 ) under @xmath117 interchange , where @xmath118 and where @xmath119 is a small mixing angle induced by @xmath79-breaking interactions @xcite .",
    "( since , as explained above , the @xmath120 ground state energies are perturbed in first order only by the @xmath121 interaction , one can ignore @xmath122 and totally antisymmetric @xmath84 admixtures . )",
    "it follows that the rest frame probabilities of spin up and spin down @xmath50 quarks are , to first order in @xmath119 , @xmath123 @xmath124 since the @xmath125 piece of the wavefunction does not interfere with the other terms in the probability distribution . in these formulas",
    "i have suppressed coordinate labels which indicate that the probability @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) is that for finding a spin up ( spin down ) @xmath50 quark at a point @xmath128 while the two up quarks are at positions @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "similarly one finds @xmath131 @xmath132 where now the wavefunction @xmath133 does play a role .",
    "i have now suppressed coordinate labels which indicate that the probability @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) is that for finding a spin up ( spin down ) @xmath49 quark at a point @xmath136 while the other up quark is at position @xmath137 and the @xmath50 quark is at position @xmath138 .",
    "note that , as advertized , the net leading - order effect of the @xmath66-breaking in the spin - averaged probabilities is to create distributions of mixed symmetry that allow the @xmath50 quark to have a different probability distribution from the two @xmath49 quarks . with the calculated quark model value @xcite @xmath139 ,",
    "the distortion of the @xmath66-symmetric probabilities is substantial .",
    "i now make the natural assumption that this distortion translates into the observation that @xmath1 as @xmath2 , and associate the measured @xmath140 and @xmath141 with functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 associated with the spin - averaged probability @xmath144 .",

    "( 20)-(23 ) for @xmath3 and @xmath4 may easily be deduced using the properties of the mixed symmetry pair of wavefunctions ( @xmath133 , @xmath146 ) under the permutation group @xmath147 .",
    "such an analysis reveals that the hyperfine interactions have distorted the distributions of @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 identically , and that the entire dominance of @xmath49 quarks as @xmath2 is due to @xmath151 .",
    "this means that @xmath152 u_v ( x ) -   { 1\\over 3}[1-c_a(x)]d_v ( x)\\ ] ] @xmath153d_v ( x)+ { 1\\over 2}c_a(x ) u_v ( x)\\ ] ] @xmath154 d_v ( x)\\ ] ] @xmath155 d_v ( x)\\ ] ] the resulting predictions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the valence region , shown in fig .",

    "the history of the prediction of the effects of @xmath66-breaking on the quark distribution functions in the valence region is somewhat convoluted .",
    "it perhaps begins with the parton model discussion by feynman @xcite who argues that as a @xmath49 or @xmath50 quark approaches @xmath162 , it must leave behind  wee \" partons with either @xmath163 or @xmath164 , and that these two configurations are unlikely to have the same @xmath6-dependence .",
    "he then notes that if the @xmath163 configuration dominates as @xmath2 , the observed ratio @xmath165 would follow .",
    "if we take the modern view that this high @xmath6 behaviour will be controlled by the valence quarks , and note the quark model correlation between isospin and spin in the valence quark sector , this argument would also naively lead to the conclusion that @xmath166 will dominate as @xmath2 . while correct , since feynman s argument relies on the  wee \" partons being uncorrelated with the leading quark , and so does not take into account the required antisymmetrization between the leading @xmath49 quark and the  wee \" @xmath49 quark , its predictions for the full valence region are unclear .    a more complete quark model argument",
    "is given in the papers of close @xcite and carlitz and kaur @xcite .",
    "they argued that @xmath66-breaking changes eq .",
    "( 5 ) into @xmath167\\ ] ] where @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 are the @xmath171 and two @xmath172 @xmath111 spin wavefunctions . for @xmath173 ,",
    "this wavefunction collapses to ( 5 ) . referring to hyperfine forces as driving the physics ( which is equivalent to feynman s assumption in this case ) ,",
    "these papers posit that @xmath66-breaking leads to @xmath174 , which would in turn lead to the relations @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 in terms of distribution functions @xmath179 and @xmath180 associated with @xmath181 and @xmath182 , respectively , with @xmath183 as @xmath2 .",
    "this model thus also leads to @xmath145 as @xmath2 and it predicts that both @xmath3 and @xmath184 as @xmath2 . while assuming @xmath174 is very natural , since these diquark spin states are eigenstates of the hyperfine interaction , this assumption is not consistent with the pauli principle unless @xmath185 and @xmath182 have very special properties under the permutation group @xmath147 or the wavefunction ( 28 ) is antisymmetrized .",
    "thus , as with feynman s argument , it is unclear what these models predict for the full valence region . the closely related model of close and thomas @xcite",
    "is based on examining the energy of the spectator diquark _",
    "after _ the deep inelastic scattering in a rest frame calculation of deep inelastic structure functions .",
    "although , as pointed out by the authors , their calculation suffers from the fact that the diquark is a colored object which can not have a well - defined energy , this calculation emphasizes the same physics and reaches the same conclusions as refs .",
    "given that the impact of the hyperfine interaction is implemented somewhat intuitively in this work , it is once again unclear whether the results presented are reliable for anything other than the @xmath2 behaviour .",
    "although they do not use the hyperfine - perturbed quark model , the formalism required to deal explicitly with the fully antisymmetrized nucleon wavefunction seems to have first been applied to the valence quark spin distribution functions by le yaouanc _ et al .",
    "they introduce an @xmath66 intraband mixing between the ground state @xmath186 $ ] and the mixed symmetry @xmath187 $ ] in an attempt to account for the observed behaviour @xmath145 as @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "this is precisely the kind of mixing introduced in ( 18 ) as required by color hyperfine interactions .",
    "( in fact , using this formalism makes calculations much simpler than in the @xmath188 basis , though perhaps less physically transparent . )",
    "they then make a prescription to boost this mixed wavefunction into the infinite momentum frame , fit the mixing angle to the data , and discuss the implications of such mixing to a wide range of phenomena .",
    "more recently , a number of authors @xcite have addressed the connection between the hyperfine - perturbed quark model ( either potential - based or bag - like ) and the quark distribution functions .",
    "most of these papers find the same two key effects i have emphasized here : axial current quenching by internal quark motion and u quark dominance as @xmath2 .    despite this extensive body of work @xcite",
    ", it does not seem to be widely appreciated that the hyperfine - perturbed valence quark model makes quite clear predictions for the asymmetries @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the valence region .",
    "i attribute this state of affairs to the fact that this work has been very ambitious : most authors have attempted  absolute \" calculations of structure functions . in doing",
    "so they encountered many obstacles , which forced them to a variety of assumptions , approximations , and  procedures \" .",
    "the result is a wide range of predictions for the structure functions with apparent agreement _ only _ on their qualitative features .",
    "in this paper i have shown that once it is assumed that the hyperfine perturbations of the quark model are responsible for the @xmath66-breaking observed in the structure functions , a very narrow band of predictions follows . in a broader context",
    ", i have argued that the extensive measurements and theoretical studies engendered by the  spin crisis \" should be anchored in knowledge of whether the valence quark spin distributions are in fact anomalous .",
    "thus whether the distributions described here prove to be correct when confronted with the data will be interesting , but not as important as the fact that such data will indicate whether the valence spin structure functions are in fact anomalous , and thus guide the search for where the resolution of the  spin crisis \" is to be found .",
    "i would like to thank frank close , claudio coriano , lionel gordon , gordon ramsey , and tony thomas for patiently discussing with me the theory behind an early incorrect draft of this paper , and gordon cates , bernard frois , krishna kumar , jim mccarthy , and paul souder for encouraging me to define the quark model predictions for the valence spin structure functions .",
    "i am particularly grateful to zein - eddine meziani who rekindled my interest in this problem by explaining to me that precision measurements of these structure functions are possible with cebaf at jefferson lab .",
