    "parallelotopes play an important role in such different fields of sciences as number theory , crystallography , stochastic geometry , theory of vector measures , etc .",

    "a simple example can be constructed as follows .",
    "consider an equilateral trapezium ( as a convex body in the plane ) such that the angle between the bigger base and each of the lateral sides equals @xmath179 , and the smaller base is 3 times shorter than the bigger base .",

    "the reader will have no difficulty in showing that the boundary of @xmath93 can be made a polyhedral herisson and parallel copies of the herisson can fill the space .",
    "* 6.3 . remarks . * to prove his famous uniqueness theorem ( see theorem 2.6 above ) , h.  minkowski developed a machinery based on an operation that is now known as the minkowski sum of convex bodies and made an enormous advance in the theory of isoperimetric inequality by proving , for example , the so - called minkowski inequality for mixed volumes ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath93 be convex polytopes and let @xmath181 be their minkowski sum .",
    "it is well known that @xmath181 is a convex polytope too . moreover , a face of @xmath181 with a prescribed outward normal vector @xmath11 can be obtained ( up to translation ) as the minkowski sum of the faces ( which may degenerate into edges or vertices ) of @xmath0 and @xmath93 with outward normal vector @xmath11 .",
    "this property leads naturally to a definition of the minkowski sum of nonconvex polyhedral herissons .",
    "actually , faces of polyhedral herissons are convex polygons and the minkowski sum is already defined for them .",
