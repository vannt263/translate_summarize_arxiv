    "it is a common knowledge that superconductors dissipate in the presence of the flux flow or , for large driving current densities , due to phase slips .",
    "it is also known that even a small ac current in zero applied field causes dissipation when none of the above sources of dissipation are present .",
    "e.g. , the resistive transition to the superconducting state recorded with small ac currents has always a finite width which for small enough currents and in zero field not always can be relegated to the flux flow , sample inhomogeneities , or thermal fluctuations . a qualitative explanation of this dissipation employs the two - fluid model with the normal and superfluid densities , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , constant in space and time.@xcite    ohmic losses in superconductors are absent for small dc currents .",
    "as was originally argued by landau for superfluids , the flow of quasiparticles is stopped by the lattice ( phonons ) or by impurities and does not contribute to the current , whereas the creation of new excitations is prohibited by the gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "the situation is different for ac currents . during the ac period @xmath6",
    ", the normal part of the fermi - liquid does not stop completely and , therefore , causes ohmic losses .",
    "when @xmath7 significantly exceeds the phase relaxation rate @xmath8 , but still is small relative to the normal carriers relaxation rate @xmath9 , the ohmic losses should approach their normal limit @xmath10 .",
    "these results were obtained within microscopic theory , see e.g. , ref .. in this article we show that for low frequencies the tdgl offers a general and simple method to approach the dissipation problem near the transition point without specific assumptions on the dissipation mechanism .",
    "we show that if superconducting wires ( channels ) are thin compared to the london depth @xmath11 and the ac current can be taken as uniform , the order parameter acquires a part oscillating in time with the frequency @xmath12 where @xmath0 is the current frequency .",
    "the order parameter modulus stays constant in space since no vortices or phase slips are assumed to exist in zero applied field and for sufficiently small currents .",
    "one can say that there is a periodic exchange between the superfluid condensate and the normal excitations , accompanied by an ac electric field @xmath13 . in general , the phase shift between the field and the current depends on relative values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the relaxation times for the order parameter and for the phase ( i.e. , for the current ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the dissipation depends on these parameters , too .    in anisotropic superconducting channels , the ac currents flowing in any but the principal crystal directions cause the electric field to have a component perpendicular to the current , i.e. , across the channel .",
    "this is due to the anisotropy of the superconductor in use and due to anisotropy of the normal conductivity .",
    "we show that for @xmath18 the transverse field is caused by the inherent for anisotropic superconductors transverse phase difference .",
    "this offers a relatively simple probe of existence of this phase difference which has been recently predicted.@xcite",
    "to set notations , we start with the first gl equation : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the coherence length , @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the vector potential and the flux quantum . for the order parameter written as @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 is proportional to the gauge invariant vector potential @xmath27    equation ( [ gl ] ) contains @xmath28 on both sides . after cancelling this factor and separating real and imaginary parts ,",
    "one obtains for the real part : @xmath29 the imaginary part coincides with div@xmath30 .",
    "the gauge invariant form of tdgl involves the scalar potential @xmath31:@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath16 is the order parameter relaxation time .",
    "separating real and imaginary parts we have : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "we are interested in coordinate independent solutions @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the system ( [ tdgl1]),([tdgl2 ] ) then takes the form : @xmath37 this should be complemented with equations for the current .",
    "a uniform current @xmath38 consists , in general , of normal and superconducting parts : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electric field directed along the channel and @xmath41 is the conductivity for the quasiparticles flow .",
    "we aim to describe the system response to ac currents ; then @xmath41 is in general @xmath0-dependent .",
    "if however the frequencies are bound by inequality @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the scattering time for the normal excitations , one can consider @xmath41 as a real @xmath0-independent quantity .",
    "the electric field is expressed in terms of gauge invariant potentials : @xmath44 so that the total current is @xmath45    at a given current , eqs.([u ] ) and ( [ jx ] ) form a complete system for two functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless vector potential @xmath48 and to measure the current density in units of the depairing value : @xcite @xmath49 with @xmath50 also , we use the so - called  current relaxation time \" @xmath51 in our view , a better term for this quantity is the  phase relaxation time \" which we use in what follows , but we keep the standard notation @xmath17 . when @xmath52 , @xmath53 and so does @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite    then , the system of equations to solve takes the form : @xmath54 where dots stand for @xmath55 .",
    "we are interested in calculating the system response to ac currents @xmath56 with amplitudes @xmath57 , i.e. , for @xmath58 .",
    "in this situation the order parameter @xmath59 is close to unity and @xmath60 .",
    "the system to solve can be simplified ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) : @xmath63 the second equation here is _ linear _ ; moreover , it is decoupled from the equation for @xmath64 and is easily solved .",
    "the solution consists of a transient part depending on initial conditions ( the general solution of the homogeneous equation ) and the long time asymptotics of our interest ( the particular solution of the full equation ) .",
    "the latter can be readily found by looking for @xmath65 of the form @xmath66 : @xmath67 this can also be written in a more familiar form : @xmath68 in the following we are interested only in the stationary long time asymptotics and omit the subscript @xmath69 . substituting the obtained @xmath65 in eq.([is1l ] ) we can find the long time asymptotics for @xmath64 . to this end , we look for @xmath70 and obtain : @xmath71 } { 2(1+\\omega^2\\tau_j^2)^2(1+\\omega^2\\tau_\\delta^2)}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this yields : @xmath72    thus , in the stationary state reached when @xmath73 , the order parameter has a part oscillating with frequency @xmath12 near the average value given in the first two terms of eq.([u_ass ] ) . clearly , the frequency doubling is due to the order parameter independence on the current direction .",
    "the zero frequency limit of eq.([u_ass ] ) coincides with the known gl result for the order parameter suppression by a dc current : @xmath74 .",
    "oscillations of the order parameter _",
    "per se _ are difficult to measure .",
    "this is not the case for the electric field @xmath13 and the dissipation density @xmath75 .",
    "the field @xmath13 of eq.([e ] ) in the stationary long time state is @xmath76 the dissipation averaged over the oscillations period follows : @xmath77 it is worth noting that for small currents both the electric field and dissipation are not affected by the order parameter relaxation time @xmath16 . for @xmath18 , the field @xmath78 and @xmath79 ; they are @xmath0-independent for @xmath80 .    since @xmath17 diverges when @xmath52 , we obtain in this limit the dissipation in the normal state @xmath81 , as expected .",
    "expanding @xmath82 of eq.([w ] ) in the small parameter @xmath83 and keeping the first correction we obtain @xmath84    while looking at the @xmath85-dependence of the dissipation near @xmath2 , it should be noted that the quasiparticle conductivity @xmath86 decreases linearly in @xmath87 due to a decrease of the normal density @xmath4 .",
    "this causes an initial increase of @xmath82 , which can be considered as manifestation of well - studied coherence effects in electromagnetic absorption .",
    "however , for frequencies of our interest @xmath42 , the  bump \" ( the maximum ) in the dissipation @xmath88 is situated at @xmath89 , i.e. , very close to @xmath2 . out of this narrow temperature domain the dissipation reduction on cooling through @xmath2 should behave as @xmath3 .",
    "in isotropic superconductors in the presence of persistent currents , the gauge invariant gradient @xmath90 is directed along the current . recently kogan and pokrovsky showed that in anisotropic superconductors the transverse phase difference may appear if the driving current does not point in any of the principal crystal directions.@xcite in particular , this situation is realized in current carrying channels cut out of anisotropic crystals with a long side in any but a principal direction and which are narrow on the scale @xmath11 .",
    "one of the possible ways to observe the transverse phase is to measure the voltage @xmath91 generated by time - dependent phase difference according to the josephson formula @xmath92 .",
    "this can be achieved by driving an ac current through the said channel , a simpler possibility to observe the transverse phase than that suggested in ref . .",
    "in the static case , the supercurrent density is given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the superconducting mass tensor ; the summation is implied over repeated indices . it is convenient to introduce the normalized inverse mass tensor @xmath95 with @xmath96 ; then the eigenvalues are related by @xmath97 . in the uniaxial case , @xmath98",
    ", the inverse masses can be expressed in terms of a single anisotropy parameter @xmath99 : @xmath100 .      , the direction of an ac current . the crystal axis @xmath105 is directed along @xmath106 .",
    "the other crystal axes are in the @xmath107 plane with a misalignment angle @xmath108 between @xmath109 and @xmath110 . ]    to describe @xmath1-dependent situations , we again employ the tdgl model , the generalization of which to the anisotropic situation is straightforward : one has to replace the operator @xmath111 in eq.([gl ] ) with @xmath112 ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "then , we employ the same procedure as in the isotropic case to make the model dimensionless .",
    "the scalar quantities @xmath20 and @xmath11 now have meaning of averages @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "the tensor @xmath116 is the normalized conductivity with @xmath117 . as with the mass tensor",
    ", we can introduce for the uniaxial case the conductivity anisotropy parameter @xmath118 so that @xmath119 and @xmath120 . with these definitions ,",
    "the components of @xmath121 are given by formulas ( [ eq2 ] ) in which @xmath122 is replaced with @xmath123 .",
    "for small currents , we have for @xmath124 : @xmath125 as in the isotropic case , the equation for @xmath126 is decoupled from that for @xmath64 .",
    "one can look for a particular solution of eq.([anis2l ] ) in the form @xmath127 to obtain a linear system of equations for @xmath128 .    perhaps , the easiest is to deal with eq.([anis2l ] ) in the crystal frame @xmath129 where all material tensors are diagonal . in this frame ,",
    "the equation to solve reads : @xmath130 the long time asymptotics is easily obtained : @xmath131 the electric field components in the channel frame @xmath132 and the dissipation read : @xmath133,\\nonumber\\\\ e_y&=&\\frac{\\phi_0j_0\\omega\\sin2\\theta}{4\\pi\\xi c}\\left[\\frac { \\cos(\\omega t+\\beta_c)}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2\\tau_j^2s_c^2+\\mu_c^2}}-\\frac { \\cos(\\omega t+\\beta_a)}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2\\tau_j^2s_a^2+\\mu_a^2 } } \\right],\\nonumber\\\\ \\overline{w}&= & \\frac{\\pi j_0 ^ 2 \\lambda^2\\omega^2\\tau_j } { c^2}\\left[\\frac{s_a\\sin^2\\theta}{\\omega^2\\tau_j^2s_a^2+\\mu_a^2}+ \\frac{s_c\\cos^2\\theta}{\\omega^2\\tau_j^2s_c^2+\\mu_c^2}\\right ] . \\label{general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , these expressions have the correct isotropic limit .",
    "it is instructive to consider a few limiting situations .    \\1 . for a dc current ( @xmath134 ) , eq.([anis1l ] )",
    "gives @xmath135 whereas eq.([anis2l ] ) yields @xmath136 .",
    "we then have @xmath137 so that the order parameter suppression by a dc current depends on the current direction .",
    "we will not write down a cumbersome expression for @xmath59 in the general case , but the physics here is the same as for the isotropic case : the order parameter has a small part oscillating with frequency @xmath12 .",
    "this situation corresponds to temperatures not too close to the critical temperature because @xmath139 when @xmath52 .",
    "we have : @xmath140    in the linear approximation in the small @xmath141 , the time averaged dissipation is absent ; the energy during each period is pumped from the condensate to the normal excitations and back in equal amounts .",
    "the electric fields are : @xmath142 the conductivity tensor @xmath121 does not enter these expressions .",
    "one may say that these electric fields are due to the @xmath1-dependence of the phase differences ( the josephson relation mentioned above ) . in particular , the very fact that the transverse field @xmath143 is a proof of existence of the transverse phase .",
    "hence , measuring the transverse and longitudinal voltages on a channel similar to the shown in fig.[fig1 ] , one can , in principle , verify eq.([eq39 ] ) and therefore observe the transverse phase difference .",
    "@xmath144 , the situation taking place in particular when @xmath145 .",
    "the dissipation of eq.([general ] ) reduces to the form similar to that of the isotropic case : @xmath146 with @xmath147 at @xmath2 , @xmath148 is the normal state dissipation .",
    "thus , on cooling through @xmath2 , the resistivity drop should behave as @xmath3 with an angular dependent coefficient .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath149 may exceed substantially the superconducting anisotropy @xmath122 causing a strong angular dependence of @xmath150 .",
    "we have also performed the linear stability analysis of our solutions of tdgl to show that the homogeneous solution is stable unless the current reaches the magnitude of the order of @xmath151 .",
    "one can argue that vortices might be generated near the boundaries at smaller currents thus destroying the uniform time - dependent states . without going to a detail discussion of this restriction",
