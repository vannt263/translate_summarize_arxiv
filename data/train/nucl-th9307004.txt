    "following the suggestion that the ( @xmath0,pn ) reaction might be a useful tool for the exploration of short - range correlations ( src ) in finite nuclei @xcite , the photoexcitation of correlated proton - neutron pairs has been studied extensively .",
    "the exploratory theoretical investigations date back to the sixties and the seventies .",
    "rather representative for the early ( @xmath0,pn ) investigations are the @xmath1o(@xmath0,pn ) calculations by w. weise _",
    "et al._. in their approach the photon was assumed to couple exclusively to the one - body convective current . at the same time a proton - neutron correlation function of the jastrow type ( @xmath5 ) was introduced in the shell - model wave functions . in this way a two - body photoabsorption process was generated which can naturally explain the emission of a nucleon pair .",
    "the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite along this vein clearly illustrate that the absolute magnitude of the cross sections is very sensitive to the value of the correlation parameter q. with a reasonable value of the correlation parameter q the calculations were found to account for the absolute magnitude of the measured ( @xmath0,pn ) strength . in most of the ( @xmath0,pn ) calculations of the seventies the meson - related contribution to the pn strength was assumed to be unimportant @xcite .",
    "+ at present the physical context of ( @xmath0,pn ) reactions is quite different .",
    "recently it has been recognized that photoabsorption on two - body currents of mesonic nature is responsible for a large fraction of the measured ( @xmath0,pn ) strength @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hope to observe direct indications of short - range correlations in nuclei has somewhat shifted from the dominant ( @xmath0,pn ) to the weaker ( @xmath0,pp ) channel which can not be fed in a direct two - nucleon knockout mechanism following photoabsorption on a pionic current .",
    "for that reason the pp channel is suggested to be more sensitive to the src . amongst the reaction mechanisms which are most likely to contribute to the ( @xmath0,pp ) strength we mention : short - range correlations of the jastrow type , intermediate delta excitation and the coupling with the strong ( @xmath0,pn ) channel .",
    "the latter involves a multi - step process consisting of an initial @xmath6 and a rescattering process of the ( n , p ) type .",
    "a similar type of channel - to - channel coupling was suggested @xcite to be essential in order to explain the observed strength in the photoninduced one - nucleon emission channels ( @xmath0,p ) and ( @xmath0,n ) where a considerable fraction of the ( @xmath0,n ) strength has been ascribed to initial photoabsorption on a proton and a rescattering process of the ( p , n ) type .",
    "the predicted coupling @xcite between the strong and the weaker channels suggests that a full understanding of the two - nucleon emission processes will only be reached after an in - depth investigation of both the ( @xmath0,pn ) and ( @xmath0,pp ) channels .",
    "the advent of high - duty cycle tagged photon facilities has revived the field of ( @xmath0,nn ) reactions as a probe for investigating nucleon - nucleon correlations in nuclei . on the theoretical side , the quantitative contribution of the meson exchange currents to the ( @xmath0,pn ) cross sections was first assessed by gari and hebach with the aid of siegert s theorem @xcite . in the fermi - gas ( @xmath0,pn ) studies by wakamatsu and matsumoto a more fundamental approach for the coupling of the photon with the mesons was followed @xcite .",
    "their current operators were derived through minimal substitution in the one - pion exchange potential .",
    "more recently , boato and gianninni calculated the contribution of the pion - exchange currents to photoinduced two - nucleon emission on finite nuclei in a factorized approach @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that several assumptions have to be made before the ( @xmath0,nn ) cross section transforms in a factorized form .",
    "first , all interaction effects between the outgoing nucleon pair and the core together with the mutual interactions of the two escaping nucleons have to be neglected .",
    "furthermore , the reaction is assumed to take place at sufficiently small internucleon distances so that only nucleon pairs moving in relative s waves are believed to take part in the interaction with the external photon field ( quasi - deuteron approximation ) .",
    "lastly , the radial dependence of the relative s waves must be discarded in order to achieve full factorization ( zero - range approximation ) .",
    "the interaction between the outgoing nucleon pair and the residual a-2 core has been recently investigated by boffi and giannini in an optical - potential model approach @xcite . in these calculations",
    "the cross section was assumed to retain its factorized form even when distortions are accounted for .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    "we have shown that even when neglecting all distortion effects important deviations between the results obtained with the factorized and the full ( unfactorized ) cross section are observed . in this paper",
    "we aim at developing an unfactorized model for two - nucleon emission reactions which remains numerically tractable and in which the interaction effects between the escaping nucleons and the core can be calculated .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we present a shell - model approach to two - nucleon emission processes in which we account for the distortions in the outgoing particle waves related to the interaction with the residual a-2 core .",
    "the method involves a partial wave expansion of the emitted nucleon waves and does naturally preserve the antisymmetrization between the escaping particles and the core . in sect .",
    "3 the model is applied to the calculation of @xmath2c(@xmath0,pp ) , @xmath1o(@xmath0,pp ) , @xmath2c(@xmath0,pn ) and @xmath1o(@xmath0,pn ) cross sections in the photon energy range below the @xmath3 resonance . in the process of calculating the cross sections we account for photoabsorption on the pionic currents ( seagull and pion - in - flight diagram ) and intermediate @xmath3 creation followed by the emission of two nucleons .",
    "we investigate the impact of the distortions on the cross sections and the role of the different reaction mechanisms . a considerable fraction of sect . 3",
    "is devoted to the study of the contribution of the ( @xmath0,pn ) and ( @xmath0,pp ) channel to the total photoabsorption strength .",
    "finally , our conclusions will be given in sect .",
    "in this paper we will be dealing with photoinduced two - nucleon emission processes , viz reactions of the type @xmath7 where n@xmath8 and n@xmath9 refer to the two escaping nucleons following the absorption of a photon with energy @xmath10 by the target nucleus a. the cross section for the considered process can be shown to take on the following form in the lab frame @xmath11 } \\ ; , \\label{five}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the lab momentum of the escaping nucleon n@xmath8 ( n@xmath9 ) , @xmath13 is the angle between @xmath14 and @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the total energy of the residual nucleus in the lab frame .",

    "we will address the problem of how to construct appropriate a - body wavefunctions @xmath22 and @xmath23 which can be used to calculate the angular cross sections for electromagnetically induced two - nucleon emission processes . for the time being we will not introduce any src corrections to the shell - model wave functions .",
    "accordingly , all the nuclear wave functions of this work are slater determinants .      despite the fact",
    "that the basic electromagnetic interaction of ( virtual ) photons with the nucleus is relatively well understood , the analysis of coincidence experiments of the type ( @xmath0,n ) and ( e , e@xmath24n ) on finite nuclei is often hampered by the strong interactions between the struck nucleon and the medium in which it is embedded .",
    "only under exceptional circumstances it was found that the ( a-1 ) nucleons will act as spectators . in the most general case a complex variety of strong interactions between the escaping nucleon and",
    "the residual core will affect the cross section .",
    "these processes are commonly referred to as the final state interaction ( fsi ) . with respect to the fsi two types of effects can be discriminated .",

    "a combined effort of several groups has resulted in a reasonable understanding of the fsi effects for the case of one escaping nucleon .",
    "the situation in which two nucleons are ejected in coincidence from a target nucleus represents a complicated three - body problem and model assumptions regarding the fsi could be expected to be indispensable in order to keep the calculations feasible .",

    "other effects which deserve to be investigated in the resonance region are off - shell effects of @xmath3 propagation , like summarized in the @xmath3-hole model @xcite , and diagrams related to the @xmath60 meson decay of the intermediate isobar .    in fig .",
    "[ io16pn ] we compare the calculated @xmath1o(@xmath0,pn ) photoabsorption strength with the ( @xmath0,1n ... ) data of ref . @xcite and the ( @xmath0,pn ) of refs .",
    "the energy range of comparison is generally considered as the quasi - deuteron region in which the photoabsorption strength is believed to be dominated by the ( @xmath0,pn ) channel . despite the large error",
    "bars our absolute and parameter - free calculations seem to confirm this picture since we exhaust a considerable fraction of the ( @xmath0,1n ... ) strength and give a fair account of the ( @xmath0,pn ) data points . in passing",
    ", it seems that there is very little room for a strong absorptive effect in the final state interaction .",
    "a similar but much more pronounced effect has been found for the ( @xmath0,p ) and ( @xmath0,n ) channel for which direct - knockout calculations ( dko ) in an optical - model approach severely underestimate the data @xcite .",
    "part of this discrepancy has been attribu ted to rescattering processes of the long - range type in the final state interaction , which yield a substantial amount of additional strength @xcite .",
    "it remains to be investigated how big these effects are in the two - nucleon emission channel .    from fig .",
    "[ ic12pn ] it is obvious that the @xmath2c(@xmath0,pn ) channel is dominated by ( 1s)@xmath101(1p)@xmath101 knockout at higher photon energies . in fig . [ 1s1p ] we show the fivefold angular cross section for the @xmath2c(@xmath0,pn)@xmath102b((1p3/2)@xmath91(1s1/2)@xmath92 ) reaction at e@xmath87=200 mev , t@xmath104=78 mev and @xmath95=270@xmath105 . the average excitation energy of the _ 2h _ state state ( 1p3/2)@xmath91(1s1/2)@xmath92 was chosen to be 22 mev .",
    "consequently , the neutron kinetic energy t@xmath106 equals almost the proton kinetic energy . for the results of fig .",
    "[ 1s1p ] we have summed over the two angular momentum states @xmath107 of the residual nucleus . the angular cross section is plotted for different combinations of the photoabsorption expansion and two values of the pion cut - off mass @xmath88 .",
    "apparently , the shape of the angular cross section of the type displayed in fig . [ 1s1p ] is roughly independent of the absorption mechanism and the value of the cut - off mass . on the contrary",
    ", the absolute value turns out to be sensitive to either of those .",
    "some theoretical ambiguities exist with respect to the value of @xmath88 .",
    "obviously , the cut - off mass simply affects the magnitude of the cross section .",
    "this dependence illustrates the sensitivity of the ( @xmath0,nn ) cross sections to the short - range effects . in the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite the calculated ( @xmath0,pp ) and ( e , e@xmath24pp ) cross sections were observed to be very sensitive to the choice of the short - range jastrow correlation functions which was introduced as a correction to the nuclear slater determinants .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that in the calculation of ref . @xcite",
    "no hadronic form factors were introduced .",
    "therefore , the jastrow correlation function acts as the sole regularization of the @xmath4nn vertices at short internucleon distances . combining hadronic form factors with a jastrow like correlation function to correct for the short - range behaviour in nuclear slater determinants , could be expected to reduce the sensitivity of the calculated cross sections to the jastrow correlation function .    in an unfactorized model",
    "the angular cross section for knockout from the single - particle orbits h and h@xmath24 is given by @xcite : @xmath108 where k is a kinematical factor , s@xmath109 determines the physics of the photoabsorption and f@xmath110 is proportional to the probability to find a nucleon pair with zero separation and total momentum p in the single - particle states h and h@xmath24 . in the insert of fig .",
    "[ 1s1p ] we show the function f@xmath111(p ) for the kinematical conditions of the displayed cross sections .",
    "it turns out that even in our fully unfactorized model , including fsi effects , the shape of the cross section is to a large extent determined by the probability f(p ) .",
    "the absorption diagrams s eem to merely modulate the main trends set by the probability f(p ) .",
    "this could be interpreted as the theoretical justification for the observation that the scaling mechanism of the ( @xmath0,nn ) data in terms of the variable p seems to work reasonably well .",
    "therefore , with the eye on future comparisons with the data we would suggest that _ absolute _ cross sections ar e compared , because any model with a two - body type of absorption mechanism will more or less fit the p dependence of the data , the main trends being set by the function f(p ) . as an alternative to the proposed type of comparions on an absolute scale ,",
    "we suggest to compare angular cross sections at a fixed value of the missing momentum p. in this way the f(p ) dependence can be ruled out and a much larger sensitivity of the calculated cross sections to the absorption mechanism is reached .",
    "in contrast to what is noticed in ( @xmath0,p ) and ( e , e@xmath24p ) reactions the distorted waves do not yield considerable shifts in the strength distributions which would be expected within a plane wave description .",
    "a possible explanation starts from considering that the a-2 system will affect the momentum of both escaping nucleons independently . in ( @xmath0,p ) and ( e , e@xmath24p ) processes , the effect of the distortions can to a large extent be parametrized by introducing an effective momentum * p*@xmath112 with which the nucleon initially escapes from the target nucleus to arrive at the detectors with momentum * p*@xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the fsi related shifts in the ( @xmath0,p ) cross sections can then be compensated for by plotting the cross sections against the _ effective _ missing momentum * p*@xmath114=*p*@xmath112-*q*@xmath87 .",
    "given the back - to - back situation , the concept of the effective momentum could be expected to apply to each of the escaping nucleon momenta , but the net effect on the total missing momentum @xmath115 will largely cancel out ( * p*@xmath116 * p * ) , which might explain the relatively small shifts induced by the distortions in two - nucleon emission processes .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a model for the description of electromagnetically induced two - nucleon emission processes from finite nuclei in a general shell - model framework .",
    "the method relies on a partial wave expansion for the escaping nucleon waves and a multipole expansion for the coupling of the ( virtual ) photon field with the nucleus .",
    "the basic assumptions of the model are that the nucleon pairs escape from the target in a one - step reaction mechanism following the absorption of the photon on the two - body currents induced by the nucleon - nucleon correlations in the target system .",
    "the currents accounted for in this work are related to one - pion exchange and intermediate @xmath3 isobar creation .    within this framework",
    "we have calculated angular cross sections for the ( @xmath0,pn ) and the ( @xmath0,pp ) reaction off the target nuclei @xmath2c and @xmath1o . for these purposes the coupling of the photon field to the two - body currents",
    "has been restricted to all diagrams involving at most one intermediate @xmath3 line and one pion .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the distortions in the outgoing nucleon waves bring about relatively small corrections to the cross sections which would be obtained in a plane - wave model .",
    "the main effect is that the distorted waves yield a reduction of the cross section .",
    "the reduction factor is dependent on the choice of the primary photoabsorption diagrams and the photon energy but was found not to be larger than two . a striking feature emerging from our investigations",
    "is that despite of the fact that the distortions can only be treated in an unfactorized model , the distortions do not seem to affect drastically the shape of the factorized cross section .",
    "consequently , the scaling of the factorized approach in terms of the missing momentum p seems to be somehow preserved , even when the plane wave approximation is dropped .    in order to regularize the nucleon - nucleon correlations at short distances , hadronic form factors had to be introduced in the calculations .",
    "some theoretical ambiguities exist with respect to the value of the cut - off parameter .",
    "the sensitivity of the calculations to this theoretical ambiguity is a 50  % uncertainty in the absolute value of the calculated cross sections .",
    "since angular cross sections for the ( @xmath0,nn ) reaction from finite nuclei are as yet not available , we have compared our calculations with total ( @xmath0,1n ... ) and ( @xmath0,pn ) photoabsorption data .",
    "the model was found to give a fair account of the data , pointing towards the realistic character of the adopted model assumptions .",
    "the ratio of the ( @xmath0,pn ) strength into the different @xmath94 channels emerged to be photon energy dependent , reflecting the sensitivity of the calculated cross sections to the nuclear structure of the final state .",
