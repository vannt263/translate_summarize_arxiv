    "the scattering of electrons by ionized impurities in solids has been studied for more than half a century .",
    "the problem is related to the nature of long - range action of the electrostatic potential , which complicates the reduction of the many - body problem to the problem of two bodies .",
    "the basic idea for solving the problem is to perform statistical averaging of the field source over the all charged particles .",
    "thus averaging leaves only effective near - field , while the far - field averages to zero .",
    "it was suggested many different theoretical models during the last 70 years .",
    "the most famous of them are the conwel and weisskopf model , models that reduce the problem to the third body exclusion method@xcite , brooks - herring model @xcite and model of the partial wave phase shifts @xcite .",
    "the conwel and weisskopf model was a simple attempt to avoid divergence in collusion integral by using cutoff parameter therefore it is not quite consistent .",
    "model of the partial wave phase shifts has been developed for the case of extremely high carrier concentrations realized in metals . in this case",
    "the born approximation for transition probability is not justified and angular momentum became essential quantum number for the scattering process .",
    "the idea of third body exclusion methods is that scattered by the given center particle must not be scattered by another one . on our opinion",
    ", the cross section must not be subjected by this additional condition because it follows from the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "given the above , the brooks - herring model is the most consistent for low and moderate carriers concentrations ( criterion can be found in  9 , ref . ) .",
    "the validity of the brooks - herring approach was discussed several times , but to the best of our knowledge this investigation mathematically not rigorous or just comparable . moreover , previous authors consider only limiting cases of non - degenerate or degenerate electron gases .",
    "it is well known that brooks - herring screened potential @xmath3 can be obtained as the solution of the poisson equation with linearized right - hand side . the parameter @xmath4 is named screening length .    the main issues that arise in this model is the validity of the expansion of the right - hand side of poisson s equation in power series and accuracy which implements a linear term of the expansion .    in the present investigations , we obtain the approximate solution of poisson s equation that contains the following non - linear terms of the expansion . as an example",
    ", the calculation of the ionized impurity scattering mobility is performed for n - gaas parameters .",
    "the results of the calculation give an opportunity to determine which areas and with what precision brooks - herring approach is valid .",
    "in addition , the results also provide an opportunity to assess the accuracy of the formulas for mobility with the following non - linear terms .",

    "we will restrict the investigation to the centrally symmetric case for the bulk semiconductor electron gas ( @xmath13 ) . leaving only the first non - zero term of the right - hand side power - series expansion",
    ", one can obtain the brooks - herring approach for the screened potential @xmath14 with the screening length @xmath4 : @xmath15 below we use dimensionless coordinate @xmath16 and potential @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the charge of the scattering center in @xmath19 units .",
    "preceding the expansion of the right - hand side of eq .",

    "we proceed the consideration , omitting the remainder term @xmath26 and supposing that tolerance is estimated by the value @xmath27 .    supposing that @xmath28 are low parameters one can replace @xmath29 with @xmath30 in the right hand side .",
    "the latter designation contains dimensionless parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( here @xmath33 is the number of iterations and @xmath34 , @xmath35 mean small values in order of argument ) .",
