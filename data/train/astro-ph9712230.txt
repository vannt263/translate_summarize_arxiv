    "the black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) are interacting binary systems in which a roche lobe filling k@xmath4 or m@xmath4type secondary transfers matter through the inner lagrangian point into orbit around a black hole accretor .",
    "the systems are therefore similar in many respects to the cataclysmic variables , the difference being that the accretor is not a white dwarf .",
    "( for a critical comparison of soft x - ray transients and dwarf novae , see van paradijs & verbunt 1984 . )",
    "the bhxbs were discovered because of large outbursts seen first in x - rays which lasted weeks to months .",
    "the systems were subsequently studied optically , and found to be binary systems with orbital periods of several hours to several days , and with large mass functions @xmath9 implying black hole primaries ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 ) .",
    "the accretion disk limit cycle mechanism which was originally put forth to account for the dwarf nova outbursts ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ; for recent reviews see cannizzo 1993a , 1998b ; osaki 1996 ) should work in other interacting binary stars .",
    "the model basically operates due to an inherent hysteretic relation between the vertically integrated viscous stress @xmath10 and the surface density @xmath11 at a fixed radius in the disk .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is the kinematic viscosity coefficient @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) parameter characterizing the magnitude of the viscous stress .",
    "when equilibrium solutions are plotted as @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) versus @xmath17 , one sees an @xmath18curve relation .",
    "the lower and upper branches of the @xmath19 which have positive slope are thermally and viscously stable , whereas the middle negatively sloping portion of the @xmath19 is unstable . during quiescence ,",
    "the gas in the accretion disk is far from steady state : matter accumulates at large radii in the disk and almost none reaches the central object .",
    "the gas is neutral , and the temperature and surface density values it possesses place it along the lower stable portion of the @xmath19 curve . as",
    "matter continues to pile up , at some point a critical surface density @xmath20 corresponding to the local maximum in the @xmath19 curve is exceeded , and a heating instability is initiated which ultimately takes all or most of the disk to the hot state wherein the gas is ionized and resides along the upper stable branch of the @xmath19 curve .",
    "the rate of viscous evolution is much greater than before , and the @xmath21 profile shifts to a near steady state configuration in which @xmath21 decreases with radius , in contrast to the quiescent configuration in which @xmath21 increases with radius . after some material has accreted onto the central object and produced an outburst , the surface density decreases until at some point the local value drops below another critical value @xmath22 characterizing the lower bend in the @xmath19 curve .",
    "this always happens near the outer disk edge , and initiates a cooling wave which propagates inward to smaller radii , shutting off the flow and reverting the disk material back into neutral gas .",
    "if this model is correct , one can not avoid having the limit cycle instability operating @xmath4 unless the mass transfer rate feeding into the outer edge exceeds a critical value ( smak 1983 ) , or irradiation is able to keep the entire disk permanently ionized ( tuchman , mineshige , & wheeler 1990 ; van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "not long after its introduction , various workers began to apply the model to the soft x - ray transients @xmath4 a class which includes systems with both neutron star and black hole accretors ( cannizzo , wheeler , & ghosh 1982 , 1985 ; lin & taam 1984 ; huang & wheeler 1989 , hereafter hw ; mineshige & wheeler 1989 , hereafter mw ) .",
    "cannizzo , chen , & livio ( 1995 , hereafter ccl ) investigated in detail the decay of the light curves accompanying the outbursts in the bhxbs .",
    "they discovered that , if a cooling wave is responsible for the decay of the outbursts , then the observed exponential decay of the soft x - ray fluxes in the bhxbs constrains the viscosity parameter @xmath14 to have the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 if the primary ( i.e. , black hole ) mass in the bhxbs is @xmath25 .",
    "this form was introduced by meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1983 , 1984 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath26 for the proportionality constant is mandated by the observed @xmath27 d @xmath28folding decay times for outbursts in the bhxbs .",
    "the constraint is actually on @xmath29 .",
    "a recent compilation of inferred black hole masses for bhxbs by bailyn et al . ( 1996 ) seems to indicate that the distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath30 , whereas the value @xmath31 was based on assuming @xmath32 . if the work of bailyn et al .",
    "is borne out , then we would need @xmath33 . to maintain continuity with ccl , however , we keep @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "vishniac & wheeler ( 1996 , hereafter vw ; see also vishniac 1997 , hereafter v97 ) present an important study which provides a framework for understanding ccl s findings based on considerations of the deviation from steady state flow conditions within the hot , inner part of the accretion disk .",
    "their key insight is that the flow within the hot part of the accretion disk which exists at small radii during the decay from maximum light after an instability has been triggered exhibits a deviation from steady state conditions as one approaches the interface with the cold portion of the disk .",
    "their approach to the problem represents a fundamental overthrow of the old idea of expressing the transition front speeds in terms of purely local conditions ( meyer 1984 ) .",
    "part of our motivation in this work is to understand and to test their model .",
    "ccl s model for the limit cycle instability had an advantage over previous studies in that their numerical resolution was much finer than in other models , and they could , through systematic testing , place limits on the extent to which certain aspects of the model could be trusted . in this work",
    "we continue with this line of inquiry by running a series of models based on the numerical code described in previous works ( cannizzo 1993b , 1994 ; hereafter c93b and c94 , respectively ; ccl ) to investigate various aspects of the model which were studied by ccl . in particular , we study ( i ) the effects of grid spacing , ( ii ) the analytical model presented by vw , ( iii ) the shape of the outburst versus instability triggering radius , ( iv ) long term light curves covering quiescence and outburst , both with and without incorporating evaporation of gas from the inner edge of the disk , ( v ) and the strength of self - irradiation of the outer disk by flux from the inner disk . in the discussion section",
    "we attempt to synthesize the lessons that were learned in the previous sections into ( somewhat of ) a coherent picture of the operation of the limit cycle instability in the bhxbs .",
    "for our standard model we use that presented in ccl . the code has been described extensively ( e.g. , c93b , c94 , ccl )",
    ": it solves explicitly for the time dependent evolution of surface density @xmath36 and midplane temperature @xmath37 by simultaneously calculating small corrections in @xmath11 and @xmath38 based on the equations of mass and energy conservation .",
    "the scalings parametrizing the steady state equilibrium disk structure are given in c93b and ccl , and are based on cannizzo & wheeler ( 1984 ) , meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1981 ) , and pringle , verbunt , & wade ( 1986 ) .",
    "c93b carried out a series of tests using the time dependent model to determine which terms are dominant and which are less important in their effect on the long term light curves .",
    "they also looked at the effect of varying the number of grid points .",
    "the results of the extensive testing done by c93b have been generally confirmed in a recent work which uses a more advanced time dependent disk instability code that solves not only the vertically averaged viscous and thermal energy equations but also the radial navier - stokes equation and therefore includes radial pressure gradients and departures from keplerian flow within the transition fronts ( ludwig & meyer 1997 ) .",
    "we assume a central object mass @xmath34 , a feeding rate into the outer disk @xmath39 ( mcclintock et al . 1983 ) , a viscosity parameter @xmath40 , an inner radius @xmath41 cm , and an outer radius @xmath42 cm .",
    "we use a grid spacing @xmath43 in sections 2.2 , 2.3 , and 2.4 , and a spacing @xmath0 in sections 2.1 and 2.5 . in the three sections",
    "for which @xmath43 , we take @xmath44 grid points where we look at the properties of individual outbursts , whereas we take @xmath45 grid points for the sections which treat complete cycles of outburst and quiescence . for section 2.1 , we take @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , and for section 2.5 we take @xmath48 ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) .      ccl utilized a grid spacing @xmath43 .",
    "they discuss earlier time dependent work by mw , ichikawa , mineshige , & kato ( 1994 ; hereafter imk ) , and kim et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1996 ; hereafter k94 and k96 , respectively ) in which a logarithmic spacing @xmath50 is adopted , taking @xmath51 grid points . some of the discussion in ccl concerning the number of grid points required to get believable results was speculative in the sense that ccl did not attempt to run models with the logarithmic spacing to substantiate their criticisms , but rather they extrapolated from what they had found using their high resolution trials",
    ". it seems worthwhile to look briefly at this issue of the logarithmic grid spacing so as to quantify the requirements for good results .",
    "figure 1 of k94 shows a trial light curve using @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath23 . to compare our results more directly with k94",
    ", we have generalized our code so that the logarithmic spacing can be used ( cannizzo 1996b ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of a series of decays for @xmath54 , 41 , 81 , 161 , 321 , and 501 grid points using the logarithmic spacing .",
    "for ease of viewing the last run was started from different initial conditions so as to be offset slightly from the first five .",
    "several aspects of the decay are apparent .",
    "the lower resolution runs have a decay which is too slow . for the @xmath54 trial , the decay constant @xmath55 d , whereas in the limit of large @xmath56 we see @xmath57 d. note also that in the low resolution runs one sees glitches in the light curves and @xmath58 curves associated with the turn - off of individual grid points ( `` turn - off '' meaning the initiation of the cooling transition ) . furthermore , @xmath58 increases with time within a given run for @xmath56 small , whereas we know from ccl and vw that for the parameters used , namely @xmath59 , the decay constant @xmath58 should not vary significantly in time .",
    "therefore , the detailed decay rate in studies such as those mentioned earlier which used @xmath60 grid points with the logarithmic spacing have decays which are spuriously slow by a factor @xmath3 , and for which the functional form for the decay is more concave upwards ( i.e. , @xmath58 increasing with time ) than it should otherwise be .",
    "ccl present numerous tests of the limit cycle model using @xmath61 for the shakura - sunyaev @xmath14 parameter .",
    "they show the results of experiments for different values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 and find that for runs with @xmath63 close to 1.5 , the decays of the outbursts have a nearly exponential form , as required by observations .",
    "ccl attempt to understand this result by casting the speed of the cooling front in terms of its width .",
    "vw show that this viewpoint is not valid : the width of the cooling front is an artifact of its speed , and not the cause .",
    "a key part of vw s insight into the physics of the cooling front and outflow from the hot , viscously evolving part of the disk is that , far away from the front the local flow speed @xmath64 , whereas in the front the flow speed @xmath65 .",
    "vw show how this leads to a front speed @xmath66 where the subscript @xmath67 denotes values within the cooling front , @xmath68)$ ] , @xmath63 is the exponent associated with the @xmath14 scaling , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are logarithmic derivatives characterizing the steady state scaling associated with the ionized state of the disk , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( vw ; ccl ) . in other words ,",
    "the scaling for the midplane temperature associated with the hot disk is @xmath73 .",
    "for the usual kramer s law opacity , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( c93b ; ccl ; vw ) . the midplane temperature associated with the local minimum in the @xmath76 steady state curves @xmath77 ( vw ) . assuming @xmath78 and using the fact that the sound speed in the front @xmath79 yields @xmath80 @xmath81/[1+(1.1/7)(n/2)]$ ] .",
    "( this last expression which is eqn . [ 34 ] of vw corrects an error in eqn .",
    "[ 4 ] of ccl , namely the @xmath82 exponent should have positive rather than negative sign .",
    "in addition , in eqn . [ 4 ] of ccl there should not be a `` k '' on the right hand side . )",
    "there are several predictions of vw s theory which are amenable to testing with our time dependent code .",
    "we examine first the evolution of @xmath83 in space and time .",
    "figure 2 shows the variation of the local values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 with radius for eight time steps spaced 10 d apart during the early decay of a model outburst .",
    "the local flow speed is in fact @xmath85 , the usual viscous flow speed , some distance upstream from the transition front .",
    "vw speculate that this point occurs only slightly interior to @xmath86 , whereas we find it happens at @xmath87 .",
    "vw s derivation is predicated on the fractional disk radius at which this point occurs remaining constant during the decay , which it does .",
    "also , the flow speed does not attain @xmath88 at the inner edge of the front , as posited by vw , but rather at the outer edge . at the inner front edge",
    "the flow has only attained a speed @xmath89 .",
    "( in looking carefully at fig . 2",
    "one might have imagined a scaling with @xmath90 in the value of @xmath91 at the inner edge of the front , but an extension of the run used to generate fig . 2 in which the cooling front is followed down to @xmath92 cm shows that the shoulder in the @xmath93 curves which lies at the inner edge of the cooling front maintains a constant level in terms of @xmath91 . ) vw note that ccl s results hinted that @xmath89 at the inner front edge , and the more detailed model presented by v97 uses this information as a refinement . figure 3 shows , for the eight time steps indicated in fig .",
    "2 , the values of the radii at which the local flow speed goes to zero and the local flow speed equals the standard viscous value @xmath94 , both given in units of the radius associated with the outermost grid point in the hot state @xmath95 . in the early stages of the outburst",
    "the ratio associated with the @xmath96 radius is @xmath97 , but later it approaches a limiting value @xmath98 .",
    "the formalism presented in vw which assumes @xmath65 for the flow speed at the inner edge of the cooling front finds the @xmath96 fractional radius to be @xmath99 , whereas the formalism in v97 which is `` corrected '' by assuming @xmath100 at the inner edge of the cooling front finds the @xmath96 fractional radius to be @xmath101 , in accord with our results .",
    "the ratio associated with the point at which viscous flow is reached asymptotes to @xmath102 , smaller than that mentioned in vw .",
    "the deviations seen in the first few time steps from the limiting values are an artifact of the transitory phase near outburst maximum when the outwardly moving heating front has stopped near the outer disk edge and begun to reflect inward as a cooling wave .",
    "this artifact is also seen in the width of the transition front , which is quite broad near the end of the peak of the outburst just as the decay is beginning ( see the upper panel in fig .",
    "5 of cannizzo 1996c ) .",
    "last , v97 note that the rate of mass outflow at the front is about three times the rate of accretion onto the central object .",
    "this is in agreement with fig .",
    "9 of ccl , and also fig .",
    "2c of c94 . in summary , the discrepancies we find with vw are minor and it seems they have captured the essential physics .    a further prediction of vw is contained within their expression for the cooling front speed .",
    "their formula is more complicated than one might have guessed from the discussion in ccl .",
    "one sees for instance a dependence on @xmath69 . from equation ( 1 )",
    "we have that @xmath103 . for the standard model parameters given in ccl and reiterated earlier , the optimal @xmath63 value for which @xmath104 is not 1.5 but rather @xmath105 . in figure 4",
    "we show the results of varying @xmath63 in much smaller increments than was attempted in ccl .",
    "eleven curves are given corresponding to @xmath106 1.50 , 1.52 , ... , 1.70 .",
    "rather than guessing an initial configuration close to outburst maximum and then following the decay , as was done in ccl , here we initiate an outburst at a small radius and wait until the disk has gone nearly entirely to the high state and then begun its decay . in this manner",
    "the disk adjusts to its desired state as the outburst decay starts , and we are not left with a long transient near the beginning of the decay as in ccl . in figure 4",
    "we see that , contrary to the discussion given in ccl , @xmath107 does not yield a precisely exponential decay .",
    "our optimal value is about @xmath108 , which is close to the value 1.656 given by vw s analytical formalism .",
    "note the small dynamic range in @xmath28folding times represented along the @xmath109axis .",
    "the observational uncertainties and intrinsic source fluctuations would probably not allow one to distinguish among the range of @xmath63 values shown here , so this result is not of direct relevance observationally .",
    "the motivation is solely to confirm vw .",
    "it would be a worthwhile exercise to analyze the decays of dwarf novae and x - ray novae in a consistent fashion to see how precise of a constraint one may be able to place on @xmath63 , or , more broadly , how essential is the functional form @xmath61 .    for completeness",
    "we show in figure 5 the variation of the width of the front during the rise and decay of an outburst .",
    "the outburst begins at a small radius , so we see first the outward propagation of the heating front , then the inward movement of the cooling front . as noted by ccl",
    ", the width of the cooling front can be approximated by @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
    "vw show that both the cooling front width and speed of propagation are set by the departure from steady state discussed earlier and are not causally linked .",
    "it is interesting that the fractional width of the outward moving heating front is given phenomenologically by @xmath112 .",
    "ludwig & meyer ( 1997 ) find somewhat broader heating fronts .",
    "their figure 14 is interesting because it plots the heating and cooling front velocities versus radius on a common scale .",
    "vw put forth an analytical theory for the period of decaying light associated with the inward moving cooling front ; no such theory currently exists for the period of rising light associated with the outward moving heating front . the sharp spike in @xmath11 accompanying the heating waves",
    "is caused by the high viscosity material pushing into the region of lower viscosity material ( lin , papaloizou , & faulkner 1985 ) .",
    "the fact that it is narrower than the cooling front must be an artifact of this pushing , but further work will be needed to determine a valid numerical parametrization of the speed in order to lead ultimately to a successful theory of the heating front .",
    "it has been known for some time that , within the context of the limit cycle model , outbursts triggered near the inner edge of the disk tend to show slow rise times , while outbursts triggered at somewhat larger radii generate faster rise times ( smak 1984 ; cannizzo , wheeler , & polidan 1986 , hereafter cwp ) .",
    "the reason for the difference in rise times is detailed in cwp .",
    "for most of the bright bhxb outbursts , one sees fast rise times ( of order a few days ) in outbursts lasting @xmath113 d. it is therefore of interest to find out what is the minimum critical radius such that a fast rise will be obtained .",
    "figure 6 shows a series of outbursts generated by starting with a smooth @xmath21 distribution resembling that expected at the end of the quiescent ( i.e. , accumulation ) phase , and adding to this profile a small spike whose maximum exceeds the local value of @xmath20 .",
    "this is carried out by superposing two functions , as shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "the functions are @xmath114 and @xmath115 where @xmath116 cm is the geometric average of the inner and outer radii , @xmath117 is the central radius of the narrow gaussian used to trigger the outburst , @xmath118 , and @xmath20 is the local maximum in @xmath11 from vertical structure computations ( cannizzo & wheeler 1984 ) . for a given trial we prescribe the initial surface density distribution by taking @xmath119 @xmath120 .",
    "five trials were run , corresponding to @xmath121(cm)@xmath122 8 , 9 , 10 , 10.25 , and 10.5 .",
    "( for ease of viewing we do not show the 10.25 and 10.5 curves in the top panel of fig . 6 . )",
    "note the stark difference in the rise time properties between the first two and last three curves .",
    "the rise is slow for the @xmath121(cm ) @xmath122 8 and 9 curves , whereas it is fast for the @xmath121(cm ) @xmath122 10 , 10.25 , and 10.5 curves ( cannizzo 1996b ) .",
    "the instability is triggered at @xmath123 for all five trials , but due to the finite travel time of the heating front , the effect of increased viscosity and mass flow rate is not felt at the inner disk until @xmath124 d later for the three trials with triggering at large radii , whereas the effect is felt much sooner for the trials triggered at small radii . the difference in the heating wave properties",
    "is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the two panels show the evolution of surface density , in 5 d steps , for the @xmath125(cm)@xmath122 9 and 10 runs .",
    "these two span the transition region of parameter space between slow and fast rise . for the outbursts triggered at large radii ,",
    "the amplitude of the outburst is larger because more mass is contained within the wave of surface density enhancement associated with the heating front .",
    "the slow rise times associated with the @xmath125(cm)@xmath122 8 and 9 curves are caused by the fact that , to enhance appreciably the rate of mass flow at the inner disk edge , the outwardly traveling heating front must access the bulk of the matter which is stored in the disk at large radii , between the lubow & shu ( 1975 ) radius ( corresponding to that point in the disk where the specific angular momentum associated with the gas leaving the l1 point at the surface of the secondary star equals the keplerian value in the disk ) and the outer disk edge , and this matter , after having made the transition from neutral to ionized gas , then has to viscously evolve ( both to smaller and larger radii ) . the physics associated with this flow",
    "is discussed in cwp and c93a .      as noted by many authors",
    ", the standard limit cycle model fails to account for observations of systems in quiescence ( see lasota 1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "one observes a significant euv and x - ray flux which we infer to be the result of accretion during quiescence , and yet if we are to take the theory literally it predicts a quiescent accretion rate which is negligibly small .",
    "the small accretion rate is mandated by the requirement that @xmath126 and @xmath127 for all radii , in particular @xmath128 .",
    "mcclintock , horne , & remillard ( 1995 ) found evidence for low level accretion @xmath129 g s@xmath130 ( if the efficiency of accretion @xmath131 ) in the quiescent state of a0620 - 00 , but this is still much greater than would be allowed in the `` pure '' version of the standard accretion disk model in which the inner disk edge extends all the way to the last stable orbit ( lasota , narayan , & yi 1996 ) .",
    "the critical accretion rate associated with @xmath22 is @xmath132 g s@xmath130 @xmath133 for bhxbs ( ccl ) .",
    "there is nothing in the model , however , which requires @xmath134 .",
    "time dependent computations of the accretion disk limit cycle instability have shown that the model still works well if the inner edge is truncated ( e.g. , angelini & verbunt 1989 ; c93b ) .",
    "there may exist some physical mechanism extrinsic to the standard limit cycle model which serves to evaporate or take material from the inner disk and transfer it more or less directly onto the accretor ( e.g. , meyer 1990 ; meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; liu , meyer , & meyer - hofmeister 1995 ) .",
    "such a mechanism may or may not fit in with the general paradigm of accretion onto black holes ( chakrabarti 1996a , 1996b ; narayan , mcclintock , & yi 1996 ) .",
    "workers are beginning to consider the effect such a process would have on the limit cycle model in terms of how the altered surface density distribution in quiescence @xmath4 in particular , the lack of an inner disk @xmath4 would change the properties of the outburst ( lasota et al .",
    "1996 ; hameury et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter hlmn ) .",
    "when we run complete cycles using the @xmath135 scaling , we find frequent outbursts which are triggered at small radii and which have slow rise times , in contrast to the observations .",
    "if the inner disk were missing due to a slow removal of matter onto the accretor , then the outburst would have to be triggered further out .",
    "this may not be a unique solution to the problem , and at least three obvious alternatives are apparent .",
    "( the problem of the quiescent x - ray flux would only be addressed by the third option . )",
    "\\(1 ) the constraint imposed by observed exponential decays @xmath40 is actually only applicable to the matter which resides in the `` hot state '' part of the disk .",
    "once the matter has made the transition to the low state , it does not participate in the flow dynamics .",
    "therefore it is quite probable that @xmath40 is a scaling which applies only to ionized gas at @xmath136 k , and for neutral gas at @xmath137 k there may be another scaling which drops @xmath14 abruptly to a value less than @xmath138 . in this case , the material would evolve less in quiescence , and there would be less tendency for the matter to spread and trigger an inside - out outburst with its attendant slow rise .",
    "\\(2 ) we have not yet activated and tested the section of our code which provides for a variable outer disk radius ( see ichikawa & osaki 1992 ) .",
    "the qualitative effect this has on the evolution is to sweep up matter at large radii which shrinks the outer disk in quiescence .",
    "the contraction is caused by the accretion of low angular momentum material .",
    "this has the effect of enhancing the surface density near @xmath139 and leaving the disk more prone to outbursts triggered at large radii ( see ichikawa & osaki 1994 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) there may exist a mechanism which prevents the cooling wave from propagating once it reaches some radius @xmath140 . since @xmath141 which provides a measure of the quiescent mass flow rate at a radius @xmath82 scales as @xmath142 ,",
    "if @xmath140 were at @xmath143 cm , for example , this would be sufficient to leave a small , hot inner disk in quiescence that could give rise to the quiescent x - rays at a level @xmath129 g s@xmath130 seen in a0620 - 00 using a standard accretion efficiency @xmath131 .",
    "having made these concessions , we must return to our original point that the euv / soft x - ray observations seem to demand some evaporation of the inner disk ( unless the third option just discussed turns out to be true ) .",
    "although we are uncertain of the physics which leads to evaporation , we should include at least an ad hoc prescription for removal of matter from the inner disk in any complete time dependent model .",

    "10 we see that , as expected , the fact that triggering of outbursts can not occur at small radii due to the truncation of the inner disk forces the rise times to shorten . even for the highest values of @xmath167 , however , the rise times are @xmath168 month @xmath4 longer than the value of several days commonly seen . for low values of the evaporation",

    "this occurs because , at some point during the inward movement of the cooling front , there is no longer any disk left into which the cooling wave may propagate .",
    "for instance , for @xmath165 we only observe about 2 decades of exponential decay in the value of @xmath169 at the inner edge , which presumably powers the soft x - ray flux we observe . in systems like a0620 - 00 , however , we observe about 3 decades of exponential decay ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",

    "therefore our finding of relatively weak irradiation for a model meant to represent a0620 - 00 is consistent with the fact that a0620 - 00 has exhibited two outbursts ( in 1917 and 1975 ) and is seemingly not prone to irradiation induced effects .",
    "it is also consistent with hw and mw who found , by comparing theory with observation for a0620 - 00 , that irradiation does not contribute overwhelmingly to the optical flux .",

    "we have only investigated properties associated with the decay . there may be other spurious systematic effects associated , for instance , with the long term light curves ( i.e. , the triggering radii and outburst rise times ) , or with the production of reflares or spikes in the light curve ( e.g. k96 ) which would be smoothed out in a much higher resolution model .",
    "\\(ii ) the light curves for outbursts have slow rise times when triggered at radii @xmath200 cm in the disk , and fast rise times when triggered at radii @xmath201 cm .",
    "there is an abrupt change in the character of the rise at some radius intermediate between these two values . in this context",

    "these experiments in which we artificially trigger the outbursts at a specific radius show that , to produce outbursts with rise times as fast as those observed , the triggering radius must be at least as large as some value between about @xmath203 and @xmath204 cm , for a0620 - 00 parameters .",
    "\\(iii ) the model of vw for the decay of the outburst , based on considerations involving a deviation from steady - state flow in the inner part of the disk , is substantially borne out in detailed testing .",

    "the underlying cause for the warner relation is thought to be the fact that the mass which can be stored up in quiescence in the limit cycle model is bounded from above by a critical value @xmath233 , and this value scales with the size of the system ( c93b ; warner 1995 ; cannizzo 1998a ) .",
    "there seems to be general agreement that the triggering mechanism for outbursts in both classes of systems is the limit cycle instability , therefore the `` maximum mass '' concept should apply to both . by comparing the @xmath230 values between the warner and vpmc relations",

    "both of which presumably have @xmath234 accretors , the comparison at a given orbital period should be direct and allow a pure estimate of the strength of the irradiation , because the sizes of the two systems and hence the surface areas of the accretion disks should be similar .",
    "for the bhxbs , however , one also needs to take into account the increased size of the disk , at given orbital period , due to the presence of a more massive central object . if we compare the warner and vpmc relations at the approximate orbital period of a0620 - 00 , we see that @xmath235 mag . for @xmath231",

    "this comparison is admittedly crude because there may also exist a correction due to an effective temperature difference ( j. van paradijs 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "we can obtain a more direct estimate simply by comparing our computed @xmath230 for a0620 - 00 with that observed in the 1975 outburst .",
    "the shortfall in optical flux in the models which ignore irradiation must be due to the reprocessing of x - ray flux .",
    "therefore by determining the deficit , we learn how much of the optical flux comes from reprocessing , and how much is due to viscous dissipation .",

    ", it seems that the contribution of the reprocessed x - ray flux to the optical flux at peak light in a0620 - 00 is @xmath168 mag , meaning its relative contribution is @xmath255% .",

    "we may quantify this last statement using the subroutine of our time dependent code which calculates the @xmath182 band flux . if the entire disk is irradiated",

    "1993 ) , or irradiation of the disk so as to reflect the cooling wave at one or two grid points as a heating front and momentarily rebrighten part of the disk ( k96 ) .    in the context of the theories which rely on irradiation , it is interesting that the reflares seem to be uniquely associated with the bhxbs ( wheeler 1998 ) .",
    "reflares are not seen in the neutron star sxts such as cen x-4 and aql x-1 . according to our estimates of the strength of irradiation , and that of previous workers ( hw ; mw ; van paradijs 1996 ) , however , irradiation is weak in the bhxbs .",
    "if reflares are unique to bhxbs , and if irradiation is weaker in bhxbs than in neutron star sxts , it seems rather unlikely that irradiation can be the bhxb specific parameter which causes reflares to occur only in the bhxbs .",
    "this makes it difficult to accept any of the irradiation - based models .",
    "another consideration is that , whatever the physical mechanism is , it must be such that it leads to a delay time between onset of the main outburst and secondary reflare that scales with orbital period .",
    "the fact that the reflare in gro j0422 + 32 occurred @xmath274 d after primary maximum , whereas in a0620 - 00 it occurred @xmath275 d after primary maximum , led clg to predict an orbital period less than 7 hr for this system . the period was later found to be 5.1 hr ( chevalier & ilovaisky 1994 , orosz & bailyn 1995 ) .    what unique property of bhxbs @xmath4 something which would not be true for the neutron star sxts @xmath4 exists that could account for the reflares ?",
    "this has already been answered by many authors @xmath4 it is the extreme value of the mass ratio @xmath276 ( bailyn 1992 ; kmh ; imk ; khvp ) .",
    "this ratio is much smaller for bhxbs than for neutron star sxts , and this can lead to resonances occurring within @xmath256 of the roche lobe of the primary wherein the disk is constrained by tidal truncation to exist .",
    "one observes superhumps ( shs ) during superoutbursts ( sos ) in the su uma class of dwarf novae ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the shs are thought to be caused by the fact that the 3:1 commensurability resonance with the binary orbital period lies within the accretion disk for @xmath277 ( whitehurst 1988 , 1994 , 1995 ) , but lies beyond the point of tidal truncation for @xmath278 .",
    "in fact , shs are only seen in short orbital period dwarf novae for which @xmath277 .",
    "whitehurst showed that when the condition @xmath277 is fulfilled , the outer disk acquires an elliptical shape which precesses in the corotating frame of the binary , and this precession causes the distance through which the mass stream must fall before striking the outer disk to vary , thereby modulating the light curve on a time scale equal to the orbital period plus a few percent .",
    "osaki ( 1989 ) combined the disk instability model with a proposed `` tidal instability '' which he envisioned to occur whenever whitehurst s condition for superhumps becomes satisfied .",
    "thermal - tidal ( tt ) instability allows for superoutbursts in the su uma stars by imagining that , whenever the outer edge of the disk expands beyond the 3:1 resonance in the disk , the increased tidal torque on the disk enforces a contraction of @xmath139 by @xmath279 % .",
    "the mass that was present in the disk at the start of the outburst is confined to a smaller volume , and the increase in @xmath280 relative to @xmath281 produces an `` over - filled '' disk that prevents the cooling wave from starting until a sizable fraction of the disk matter has accreted onto the central object .",
    "the motivation for the contraction of the outer disk was not obvious , based on whitehurst s time dependent calculations , and led to criticisms ( whitehurst 1994 ; cannizzo 1996a ) .",
    "recent work by murray ( 1997 ) which utilizes a more advanced sph model than was available to whitehurst , however , does in fact show a contraction of the outer radius which is coincident with the growth into the nonlinear regime of the elliptical disk induced by the 3:1 resonance .",
    "this gives credence to osaki s model .",
    "what does this have to do with the reflares in the bhxb outburst light curves ?",
    "a potentially key observation is that , in the bhxb gro j0422 + 32 , shs appeared in the outburst at about the same time as the reflare , thereby arguing for a direct connection between the nonlinear outcome of the 3:1 instability @xmath4 namely the formation of an eccentric disk and concomitant shs @xmath4 and the reflare ( kmh , khvp ) . the crucial difference which the global effect the disk contraction has in going from accretion disks in dwarf novae to those in the bhxbs has to do with the growth time to reach the nonlinear regime of the tidal instability .",
    "several workers have suggested a direct connection between the shs and the reflares ( kmh , imk , khvp ) , namely , that it is the contraction of the disk in osaki s tt model that leads to the reflares .",
    "imk argue that the 3:1 resonance growth time varies as @xmath282)$ ] , where @xmath283 is the keplerian frequency at the outer disk edge .",
    "they point out that @xmath284 is about 30 times larger for the bhxbs than for the su uma stars . for normal outbursts which turn into sos in the su uma stars by virtue of the expansion of @xmath139 beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , the time @xmath284(su uma)@xmath285 d , so that one sees in the light curves first a rise to maximum associated with the normal outburst , then a brief dip , and then a rebrightening to maximum as the forced contraction of the accretion disk becomes active and the disk gas gets confined to a smaller radius .",
    "this constitutes the formal start of the so , marked subsequently by a long term slower - than - exponential decline that typifies decays from maximum light in which the cooling front is unable to propagate .",
    "if @xmath286 d for the bhxbs , this would have important consequences for the interaction of the contraction phase with the inward propagation of the cooling front .",
    "this time scale is about three @xmath28foldings for the time to deplete the mass of the hot part of the accretion disk , or one @xmath28folding time @xmath287 for the cooling front to move inward ( ccl ) , so the cooling front has already had ample time to travel inward a considerable distance from @xmath139 as defined by the tidal truncation , and subsequently redefined by the increased degree of tidal truncation due to the 3:1 resonance - induced elliptical disk .",
    "there is no opportunity for the cooling front to be prevented from forming as in the su uma sos , and yet the gas in the accretion disk must be confined in some manner to a smaller value .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the degree of this contraction without doing a detailed calculation , considering especially the fact that the contraction occurs primarily in the outer , cold portion of the disk .",
    "one suspects that the brief period of augmentation in the local @xmath21 values would produce a reflection of the cooling wave as a heating wave , which would propagate out some distance and then reflect inward again as a cooling front .",
    "this is found in time dependent calculations ( imk ) .",
    "the amplitude of the reflares observed in the bhxb outburst light curves are about a factor of 2 with respect to the x - ray flux observed just prior to the start of the reflare .",
    "this would not require a large reflection in order to be produced .",
    "the reflares caused by the reflection of cooling waves into heating waves seen in some of the light curves in ccl showed increases of @xmath220 in flux .",
    "( their cause is thought to be numerical , however , and not physical . ) in summary , the fast growth time for the 3:1 instability in the su uma stars leads to an immediate contraction in @xmath139 and consequent over - filled disk which can only decay viscously ( since the cooling front can not propagate ) , whereas the slow growth time for the 3:1 instability in the bhxbs means that the contraction , when it does occur , is too late to produce an over - filled disk .",
    "instead , one has only a minor re - adjustment in @xmath21 which produces a reflected transition front and resultant reflare .",
    "imk attempted to calculate models using the tt instability for bhxbs , but various deficiencies in their work led to outbursts which did not resemble those observed .",
    "they use a low resolution logarithmic spacing @xmath51 to cover a dynamic range in disk radii @xmath288 , they use a parametrization of @xmath289 ( c94 ) which was criticized as not being valid for bhxb parameters ( ccl ) , and their model contains detailed ad hoc prescriptions for the functional form of the increase in the tidal torque associated with the tt instability ( both @xmath14 and the torque proportionality constant each have @xmath290 adjustable parameters ) . the light curve they present covering an outburst with",
    "the tt induced reflare shows a factor @xmath229 increase in @xmath291 in the reflare , rather than the observed factor @xmath243 increase .",
    "the decay characteristics are also not as observed .",
    "nevertheless their model represents a first step toward a complete theory of outburst plus reflare in a time dependent model .",
    "work is currently underway to activate and test the portion of our code which allows for a variable outer disk radius so as to test the global manifestation of osaki s tt instability in the bhxbs .",
    "we have investigated several aspects of the accretion disk limit cycle mechanism as it applies to bhxbs .",
    "our main impetus is to extend work reported in ccl by running more extensive time dependent models , cover complete cycles of outburst and quiescence , and look in detail at several aspects of the model not studied by ccl .",
    "we find that the explanation for the cooling front speed put forth by vw seems to account for the deviation from steady state flow which we observe . in running complete cycles",
    ", we find a strong tendency using the ccl @xmath14 form for frequent outbursts to occur which begin at small radii in the disk and have slow rise times , in contrast to the observations .",
    "evaporation of material from the inner disk does not shift the surface density distribution enough to decrease the rise times sufficiently , although it does increase the recurrence times for outbursts to an acceptable value ( lasota et al .",
    "a separate issue is the necessity of having some mechanism distinct from the standard limit cycle operating in order to supply material to accrete onto the central object in quiescence so as to provide substantial x - ray and euv radiation . finally , for our standard model which is meant to represent a system like a0620 - 00 , irradiation of the disk does not appear to be strong enough to change the structure significantly .",
    "this may pose a challenge for workers that seek to invoke irradiation to prevent the cooling front from propagating . also , the apparent weakness of irradiation in the bhxbs relative to the neutron star binaries may present problems for theories of the reflare which are based on irradiation .",
    "this paper is not intended to be the final word in this subject , but should only serve to pose additional questions which must be looked into .",
    "there is clearly much more work to be done . in spite of our efforts",
    "we have failed to produce a successful `` standard model '' for a0620 - 00 which reproduces not only the @xmath27 d @xmath28folding time exponential decay and @xmath292 yr recurrence time scale for outbursts but also the fast rise @xmath4 @xmath293 d. we have purposely avoided introducing modifications to the @xmath14 form utilized by ccl in order to provide continuity with that work .",
    "it now appears , however , that it may prove necessary to reduce @xmath14 in the low state below that which would naturally occur using the ccl scaling .",
    "this could be carried out for instance by reducing @xmath62",
    ". there may be other ways to get the fast rise , such as having a stalled cooling front which would deplete @xmath21 for small @xmath82 .",
    "in this work we have only activated the portion of the our code which calculates the irradiation temperature based on the central flux from the disk and the local shape , as explained in tuchman et al .",
    "the next step is to activate and test the portion which also `` corrects '' the local disk temperature ( both effective and midplane ) based on the irradiation temperature , which would in turn affect the global evolution of the disk ( as in k96 ) .",
    "since the irradiation temperature does not even approach the effective temperature for parameters relevant to a0620 - 00 , the kinematic effect on the disk would be insignificant .",
    "for the neutron star systems , however , irradiation will most likely play an important role .",
    "we have also chosen not to activate the part of the code which treats the variation of outer disk radius ( smak 1984 ) .",
    "this may affect the nature of the light curves accompanying the outbursts , in particular the rise times , by virtue of the mass swept up at large radii by the arrival of low angular momentum material from the secondary star .",
