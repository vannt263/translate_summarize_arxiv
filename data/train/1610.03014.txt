    "in this paper , we consider numerical methods for the computation of the @xmath0-gradient flow of a planar curve : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a time - dependent planar curve .",

    "it is known that the numerical solutions obtained by these methods are not only physically realistic but also have the advantage of numerical stability ( cf .",
    "in particular , structure - preserving methods are suitable for computations over long time intervals .    here ,",
    "we consider in more detail the energy dissipation for the gradient flow . as is well known , the ( classical ) solution of the curvature flow blows up in finite time .",
    "in particular , if the initial curve is self - crossing , a cusp appears . on the other hand , the elastic flow , which is a regularized version of , has a unique global solution @xcite .",
    "moreover , as @xmath13 , the solution of converges to that of under conditions when the classical solution of ( see  @xcite ) exists . note that the elastic flow formally degenerates to the curvature flow as @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the time at which a cusp appears .",
    "then , we are interested in determining the limit of the elastic flow as @xmath13 after time @xmath14 . therefore , the structure - preserving method is effective for investigating numerically the long - time behavior of the elastic flow with self - crossing initial curves .",
    "there are many works that consider the numerical computation of equations and ( for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , none of them explicitly consider the discrete energy dissipation property .",
    "although some numerical examples in these works seem to be dissipative , no mathematical proofs are given .",
    "moreover , all of them use the p1-finite element method , which approximates solutions using polygonal curves . therefore , since they can not handle higher order derivatives directly , it is necessary to consider the mixed formulation for fourth - order equations .",
    "it is remarkable that these studies present numerical schemes for individual problems , and do not give a general framework for approximating gradient flows .",
    "there is a further issue regarding the arrangement of nodal points , when a curve evolution equation is discretized with polygonal curves .",
    "however , we do not consider this issue in detail in this paper .",
    "for gradient flows of graphs , there are some general frameworks to construct dissipative numerical schemes . in @xcite , a structure - preserving finite difference scheme , the so - called discrete variational derivative method ,",

    "the main idea of these studies is to discretize the chain rule . in @xcite ,",
    "discrete partial derivatives are introduced and a discretization of the chain rule is obtained .",
    "a similar approach is used in our scheme .",

    "we obtain the discrete chain rule formula with respect to the @xmath18-structure .",

    "@xcite ) . the b - spline approach ( also called nurbs in general )",
    "is widely used to compute the solution to large - scale deformation problems , such as fluid - structure interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this method is called isogeometric analysis  @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that a b - spline curve of degree @xmath19 ( definition  [ def : b - spline ] ) is a @xmath20 curve .",
    "hence we can directly address higher order derivatives , and we can derive the fully discretized scheme by the galerkin method ( scheme  [ scheme : full - disc ] ) . this procedure is independent of the properties of the energy functional , and thus , our scheme gives a general framework for the approximation of gradient flows .",

    "<S> , we use a similar approach to the discrete partial derivative method , which is a structure - preserving method for the gradient flows of graphs . for the approximation of curves , we use b - spline curves . owing to the smoothness of b - spline functions , </S>",
    "<S> we can directly address higher order derivatives . in the last part of the paper , we consider some numerical examples of the elastic flow , which exhibit topology - changing solutions and more complicated evolution . </S>",
