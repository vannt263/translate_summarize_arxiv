    "the triple-@xmath0 process plays an important role in stellar physics , since it triggers helium burning in stars . owing to the absence of stable isotopes of mass 5 and 8",
    ", it represents the only way to synthesize @xmath4c in stars . at typical helium burning temperatures ,",
    "the triple-@xmath0 process is assumed to be sequential @xcite .",
    "two @xmath0 particles are in equilibrium with the unstable @xmath5be isotope , which then captures a third @xmath0 .",
    "the second step , the @xmath6 reaction , is strongly influenced by the @xmath4c @xmath7 state ( @xmath8 mev ) , located 0.29 mev above the @xmath9be threshold .",
    "this resonance was predicted by hoyle @xcite and found experimentally later @xcite .",
    "it is known , in the nuclear astrophysics community , as the hoyle state .",
    "the properties ( energy , alpha and gamma widths ) of this resonance are well known experimentally .",
    "the calculation of the triple-@xmath0 reaction rate is , however , a subject of intense debate .",
    "first calculations @xcite were based on the hypothesis of a sequential process , where the resonant nature of @xmath5be and of the @xmath4c@xmath10 ) resonance are accounted for by a breit - wigner ( bw ) approximation . for narrow resonances ( @xmath11 ev in @xmath5be , and @xmath12 ev in the hoyle state ) ,",
    "the bw formalism is expected to provide a fair approximation of the phase shifts and cross sections .",
    "this simple approach was recently challenged by ogata _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who use the continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) method  @xcite . in the cdcc theory ,",
    "the @xmath5be continuum is simulated by approximate , square - integrable wave functions .",
    "the cdcc method provides a consistent way to include the @xmath13 continuum in the calculation of the triple-@xmath0 reaction rate .",
    "however , as the involved resonances are narrow , the bw approximation is expected to be reliable .",
    "cdcc results should therefore not be very different from results obtained previously in the literature .",
    "in fact , ogata _ et al . _ found reaction rates much higher than those of nacre ( 20 orders of magnitude at low temperatures ) . at typical helium burning temperatures , the cdcc rates , when included in stellar models , are incompatible with observation  @xcite .",
    "the unexpectedly large cdcc results have triggered several theoretical studies , in different models .",
    "in particular the sequential picture was questioned by garrido _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who suggest to extend the standard bw approximation to the three-@xmath0 capture , which does not go through the @xmath5be resonance .",
    "this simple direct model was then improved by nguyen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who use the hyperspherical formalism , associated with the @xmath14-matrix theory ( hhr ) , to determine solutions of the @xmath15 scattering problem .",
    "these approaches essentially confirm the nacre reaction rate above @xmath16gk , where helium burning occurs .",
    "the large cdcc results can not be explained .",
    "more recently , ishikawa  @xcite investigated the triple-@xmath0 problem in the faddeev formalism .",
    "the results are essentially in agreement with nacre , and much smaller than the recent three - body calculations .    considering that the cdcc reaction rates above @xmath17gk are obviously inconsistent with observation , all other models agree in this temperature region , relevant for astrophysics . at lower temperatures , however",
    ", significant differences still exist between the various approaches .",
    "if the capture cross sections at these low energies are of minor importance in astrophysics , they raise interesting questions for nuclear physics aspects .",
    "the triple-@xmath0 reaction rate offers a unique opportunity to investigate further three - body problems , in particular with three charged particles .    in this work , we address qualitatively the @xmath18 system at low energies assuming a direct process , and we focus on general properties of the coulomb interaction .",

    "we discuss totally symmetric hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) in appendix  [ app.symm.pol ] , calculate the coulomb matrix element in the hyperspherical coordinate in appendix  [ coulomb.m.e ] , examine the convergence of the hh expansion in appendix  [ hhe ] , and analyze partial wave contents produced by symmetrization in appendix  [ pwc ] .",
    "let us consider a process @xmath20 , where e.g. , 2 stands for a nucleus with mass @xmath21 in the mass unit @xmath22 .",
    "all masses of particles 2 , 3 and 4 are assumed to be the same .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the sequential reaction rate @xmath24 . in this approximation ,",
    "the triple-@xmath0 capture is assumed to proceed in two steps . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the reaction rate is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the reduced mass of the @xmath0 + @xmath0 system , and @xmath27 is the energy with respect to the @xmath0 + @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the elastic cross section of @xmath0 + @xmath0 scattering is given by a bw approximation , where the width of the @xmath5be ground state is energy dependent .",
    "the @xmath28 rate assumes that @xmath5be has been formed at an energy @xmath27 different from @xmath29 , and that it is bound .",
    "this rate is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the reduced mass of the @xmath0 + @xmath5be system , and @xmath32 is the energy with respect to its threshold ( which varies with the formation energy @xmath27 ) .",
    "cross section @xmath33 corresponds to the @xmath6 reaction , where @xmath32 is the @xmath9be energy .",
    "this formalism has been used in the nacre compilation for the calculation of the triple-@xmath0 process @xcite .",

    "the @xmath39 value is @xmath40 mev .",
    "we want to relate @xmath24 to @xmath41 .",
    "the use of the detailed balance or reciprocity relation leads to @xmath42 the validity of eq .",
    "( [ tnr3 ] ) relies on the time - reversal invariance of the hamiltonian .",

    ", @xmath44 denotes the photoabsorption cross section @xmath45 with @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and the above relation leads to the desired expression @xmath48 see refs .",
    "@xcite for the notations .",
    "if the photoabsorption occurs by an electric multipole @xmath49 , its photoabsorption cross section can be expressed in terms of the strength function @xmath50 by @xmath51 where @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the @xmath49 operator , @xmath54 is the angular momentum of the initial state and notation @xmath55 includes the integration over the final state energy @xmath56 as well as the summation over the other quantum numbers that specify the final state .",
    "the coulomb potential for a system including three charged particles is most transparently treated in the hyperspherical coordinates . here",
    "we also express those operators that are relevant to the triple-@xmath0 reaction in terms of the hyperspherical coordinates .",

    "the coulomb potential for 3@xmath0 particles can be treated in the hh method .",
    "particularly we determine the coulomb potential that gives the most enhanced triple-@xmath0 reaction rate at low energies .",
    "in other words , the coulomb potential should be as low as possible for 3@xmath0 particles .",
    "the coulomb potential for 3@xmath0 particles is expressed in hyperspherical coordinates as @xmath94 with a ` charge factor ' operator @xmath95 as @xmath96 is symmetric with respect to the coordinate transformation , we may omit the suffix @xmath97 of @xmath67 .",
    "let us consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath98 the eigenfunction @xmath99 must be symmetric with respect to the permutations of particles 1,2,3 .",

    "a solution @xmath99 is expanded in the set @xmath101 .",
    "unfortunately @xmath103 has non - vanishing matrix elements for @xmath104 , which is in fact the origin that makes a complete treatment of the coulomb three - body problem extremely hard .",
