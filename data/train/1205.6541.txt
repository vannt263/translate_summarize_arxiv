    "silicene has recently been synthesized@xcite and attracted much attention@xcite .",
    "it is a monolayer of silicon atoms forming a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice .",
    "almost every striking property of graphene could be transferred to this innovative material .",
    "indeed , its low - energy dynamics is described by the dirac theory as in graphene . however , dirac electrons are massive due to a relatively large spin - orbit ( so ) gap of @xmath0mev in silicene , where the mass can be controlled by applying the electric field @xmath1 perpendicular to the silicene sheet@xcite .",
    "a novel feature is that silicene is a topological insulator@xcite , which is characterized by a full insulating gap in the bulk and helical gapless edges .",
    "silicene undergoes a topological phase transition from a topological insulator to a band insulator as @xmath2 increases and crosses the critical field @xmath3 , as has been shown@xcite by examining numerically the emergence of the helical zero energy modes in silicene nanoribbons . in this paper",
    "we present an analytic result by calculating the topological numbers based on the effective dirac theory .",
    "we show that the origin of the topological numbers is a pseudospin meron in the momentum space .",
    "the pseudospin degree of freedom arises from the two - sublattice structure ( fig.[figillust ] ) .",
    "we also propose a simple method to determine experimentally the phase transition point with the use of the diamagnetism of silicene ( fig.[figillust ] ) .",
    "the magnetism of conventional metal is composed of the pauli paramagnetism due to the spin magnetic moment and the landau diamagnetism due to the orbital motion of electrons .",
    "the free electron system exhibits paramagnetism since the magnitude of the spin component is larger than the orbital component .",
    "contrarily , the landau diamagnetism overcomes the pauli paramagnetism in a certain condensed matter system .",
    "an extreme case is provided by graphene@xcite , where the orbital susceptibility has a strong singularity due to the gapless character of dirac electrons .",
    "we calculate the magnetic susceptibility of silicene as a function of the electric field @xmath1 . we expect to have a strong singularity at the critical electric field , @xmath4 , since dirac electrons become gapless at this point@xcite . indeed , we show that it diverges at the critical electric field at zero temperature ( @xmath5 ) , though the divergence is round off at finite temperature . however , it is clearly observable as long as @xmath6 .",
    "our result is important also from the viewpoint of cross correlation between electric field and magnetism . in general electric - field - controled magnetism",
    "is rather difficult compared to magnetic - field - controled electricity . on the other hand , the former is desirable since we can precisely control electric field .",
    "our finding will be important for future electro - magnetic correlated devices .     with the use of the magnetic susceptibility of silicene .",
    "silicene consists of a honeycomb lattice of silicon atoms with two sublattices made of a sites ( red ) and b sites ( blue ) .",

    "we take a silicene sheet on the @xmath26-plane , and apply the electric field @xmath27 perpendicular to the plane .",
    "there appear two additional terms in the hamiltonian,@xmath28where the first term represents the first rashba so coupling associated with the nearest neighbor hopping , which is induced by external electric field@xcite .",
    "it is proportional to the external electric field , @xmath29 , and becomes of the order of @xmath30ev at @xmath31mev@xmath32 .",
    "the second term is the staggered sublattice potential term @xmath33 between silicon atoms at a sites and b sites .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the first rashba so coupling term ( @xmath35 ) is missed in the previous analysisezawanjp .     as a function of the electric field @xmath27 .",
