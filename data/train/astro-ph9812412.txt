    "the calculations are carried out in an einstein  de sitter world model , but the results depend only weakly on the world model assumed .",
    "in a blank field the cumulative sub - mm galaxy counts  the surface density of galaxies brighter than a given flux density limit  can be derived by simply dividing the number of detected sources by the surveyed area , although the effects of clustering may have to be considered in small fields .",
    "the calculation is more complicated in the field of a gravitational lens , which magnifies and distorts the background sky ",
    "the source plane  by an amount that depends on both position and redshift . as a result of lensing",
    ", some regions of the source plane are observed to greater depths than others , even if the sensitivity across the observed map  the image plane  is uniform . with a sufficiently detailed mass model for the lens ,",
    "corrections can be applied to model the effects of lensing accurately , and thus the enhanced sensitivity to faint background sources can be exploited .",
    "moreover , lensing provides a further advantage : because sub - mm wave telescopes have coarse angular resolution as compared with optical telescopes , source confusion can contribute noise in faint images ( blain , ivison , & smail 1998 ; hughes et al .",
    "the flux density of all background sources is increased by a lensing cluster , while their mean separation on the sky is also increased .",
    "both of these features reduce the problem of confusion .",
    "the lensing effect of the rich clusters exploited in the survey is modeled accurately by using multiple - component mass distributions that describe the extended potential well of the clusters and their more massive individual member galaxies ( e.g. ,  kneib et al .",
    "these models are derived using the positions of multiply imaged features identified in high - resolution optical images and are very well constrained using the spectroscopic redshifts of these multiple images .",

    "the uncertainties in the magnification of background galaxies derived from these models are 10%20% and so are comparable with the uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the scuba maps .",
    "the lens amplification depends on both the redshift of the lens ( @xmath9 ) and source ( @xmath10 ) , although if @xmath11 this effect is minor .",
    "the lensing clusters are at redshifts between 0.19 and 0.41 , and so the effect is small if @xmath12 .",
    "a complete redshift distribution of scuba - selected galaxies is gradually being determined ( barger et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; hughes et al .  1998 ; lilly et al .  1999 ; smail et al .  1998 ) .",
    "based on identifications made in high - quality optical images and extremely deep radio maps , and follow - up optical spectroscopy ( barger et al .",
    "1999 ) , we are able to distinguish which scuba galaxies are within the clusters , and in the foreground and background . the numbers of galaxies assigned to each category are listed in table1 .",
    "it is likely that more than 80% of the _ background _ galaxies are at @xmath13 ( smail et al .",
    "1998 ) , and no background candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath14 ( barger et al .",
    "1999 ) . hence , @xmath12 for the background galaxies , and so is indeed expected to be much greater than @xmath9 .",
    "uncertainties in the redshift distribution of the scuba galaxies should not affect the derived counts significantly .",
    "the full sample of spectroscopic identifications of foreground / cluster / background galaxies span the redshift range 0.2 to 2.8 ; 14 out of the 17 detected galaxies have plausible identifications ( barger et al .",
    "the potential systematic errors due to these uncertainties are discussed in section3.1 . at about the 15% level , they comprise a small contribution to the error budget in the count calculations .",
    "two approaches were taken to derive counts from our sub - mm maps and catalogs : a direct inversion of the observed source catalog , and a monte carlo method to constrain a parametric model for the background source counts .",

    "( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "we also conducted the analysis using the more liberal 50% ( greater than 3@xmath15 ) sample , in order to both compare the results and assess the systematic error expected from the procedure .",

    "the 50% and 80% samples contain eight and 14 noncluster galaxies respectively .    using the appropriate lenstool models ,",
    "the detected sources identified with background galaxies were mapped from their observed positions back onto the source planes at four values of @xmath16 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "the flux densities of the galaxies were also corrected individually for lens amplification , leading to true flux densities in the source plane that are less than the observed values . again , we stress that this correction is only weakly dependent on redshift for our sources at @xmath12 .",
    "none of the background scuba sources can be explained easily as multiple images of the same galaxy ; however , such multiple images could be detected in deeper integrations .",
    "the number of galaxies in the catalog that are brighter than a flux density @xmath17 , @xmath18 is calculated at each redshift by simply counting the number of sources brighter than @xmath17 _ in the source plane , after correcting for lensing_. a simple poisson uncertainty is attached to this value .    fig .  1 .  the cumulative area of the source plane @xmath19 , at @xmath20 , that experiences a magnification greater than @xmath0 for all seven clusters in the smail et al .",

    "the area of background sky within which a galaxy would be detectable in each cluster was determined from a map of the magnification in the source plane , derived using the lenstool models .",
    "this quantity is also a weak function of redshift for @xmath12 .",

    "a galaxy with a flux density @xmath17 in the source plane will appear in the image plane of a particular cluster above a detection threshold @xmath21 if it is magnified by a factor greater than @xmath22 .",

    "the spread in the results between these four cases as a function of flux density threshold is shown in figure2 .",
    "the results obtained from both the 50% and 80% samples at each redshift are compared with the mean count in each sample .",
    "the counts are remarkably consistent , reflecting partly that the value of the power - law index @xmath27 in the count @xmath28 is @xmath29 , indicating a small but positive magnification bias .",

    "the mean scatter of the results about the mean for the four different redshifts between flux densities of 0.5 and 8mjy is 12% in both the 50% and 80% samples .",
    "note for comparison that the poisson error on the counts is about 35% .      to confirm the reliability of the results from the direct inversion we performed monte carlo simulations of our observations using a parametric model for the background galaxy counts , and thus derived the best - fit parameters by comparison with the observations .",
    "this technique has the advantage that we can explicitly include the incompleteness of our maps at faint flux densities and so derive the counts separately for both the 80% and 50% samples .",
    "galaxies were drawn from a population with a count described by a power - law model : @xmath32 .",
    "for each realization we selected a value of @xmath33 and @xmath34 and populated the source planes of the seven clusters at random for each of the four values of redshift used above .",

    "the direct and parametric estimates of the faint sub - mm counts in table1 and figure3 are fully consistent , supporting the reliability and robustness of these results .",
    "the new counts are deeper and more accurate than any existing data , including the fluctuation analysis of the extremely deep scuba image of the hubble deep field ( hughes et al .",
    "this shows the advantages of making sub - mm observations of cluster lenses for which accurate mass models are available . at brighter flux density levels ,",
    "the results are coincident with and have comparable errors to the initial results of the scuba survey in canada  france redshift survey fields ( eales et al .",

    "by exploiting the magnification due to clusters of galaxies , we have determined the surface density of submillimeter - luminous galaxies down to a very faint flux density limit of 0.5mjy at 850@xmath0 m , several times fainter than the confusion limit of the jcmt in blank fields .",
    "the results are consistent with those from an initial analysis of a subset of our catalog ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ) and with the shallower counts from blank - field surveys .",
    "the errors on the counts are now reduced by a factor of 2 as compared with our earlier work .",
    "the count of 850@xmath0 m galaxies brighter than 1mjy is @xmath4deg@xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that the systematic errors due to both the uncertainties in the redshift distribution of the detected galaxies and the mass models of the clusters studied are less than 25% , and thus comparable to the absolute flux calibration of the scuba maps .    by summing the new counts down to their flux density limit",
    ", we have shown that our scuba maps resolve the major part of the 850@xmath0 m background radiation intensity into individual ultraluminous galaxies with luminosities greater than @xmath53 ( equivalent to star - formation rates greater than @xmath54yr@xmath6 if no agn contribution is present ) . hence , most of the dust - enshrouded star - formation / agn activity in the distant universe took place in rare but extreme events .",
    "deeper scuba observations in the fields of rich lensing clusters will allow the counts ultimately to be pushed to even fainter flux densities than those achieved here , especially if an upgraded scuba becomes available .",
