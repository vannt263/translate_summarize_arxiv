    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) radar systems have received considerable attention in recent years . unlike a phased - array radar ,",
    "a mimo radar @xcite transmits multiple independent waveforms from its antennas .",
    "mimo radar with widely separated antennas @xcite exhibits spatial diversity , which improves target resolution . in colocated mimo radar @xcite , phase differences induced by transmit and receive antennas can be exploited to form a long virtual array and thus achieve superior spatial resolution as compared to traditional radar systems .",
    "compressive sensing ( cs ) is a recent development @xcite-@xcite and has already been applied successfully in diverse fields such as image processing and wireless communications .",
    "cs theory states that a @xmath1-sparse signal @xmath2 of length @xmath3 can be recovered exactly with high probability from @xmath4 measurements via @xmath0-optimization .",
    "the application of cs to radar systems was investigated in @xcite-@xcite , and to mimo radar in @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite , a uniform linear array was considered as a transmit and receive antenna configuration . in @xcite and @xcite , the authors proposed a mimo radar implemented by a small scale network . according to @xcite ,",
    "spatially distributed network nodes , each equipped with a single antenna , serve as transmit and receive antenna elements .",
    "the transmit nodes transmit periodic pulses .",
    "the receive nodes forward their compressive measurements to a fusion center . exploiting the spareness of targets in the angle - doppler space ,",
    "an @xmath0-optimization problem is formulated and solved at the fusion center in order to extract target angle and doppler information .",
    "this approach achieves the superior resolution of mimo radar with far fewer samples than are required by conventional approaches .",
    "this implies low power consumption for the receive nodes .",
    "the contribution of this paper is a low complexity cs approach for obtaining range as well as direction of arrival ( doa ) and doppler information about the target .",
    "range estimation can not not be obtained with the method of @xcite , as the target range causes an identical phase shift to the signals received at all nodes and during all pulses .",
    "one way to obtain range information is to measure the travel time of the emitted radar signal @xcite .",
    "however , the range resolution of such an approach might be limited . in this paper , we modify the transmitted waveforms of the scheme of @xcite , so that range information is reflected in different phase shifts over different pulses . in particular , the transmit nodes transmit pulses whose frequency increases by some step from one pulse to the next . in this way , we introduce the step frequency radar approach @xcite to mimo radar , an approach that results in high range resolution .",
    "range resolution tends to increase as the transmitted signal bandwidth increases",
    ". however , wideband signals correspond to very short pulses , which experience low signal - to - noise ratios at the receiver .",
    "a step frequency radar transmits a sequence of longer pulses that are narrowband and together cover a wide frequency range .",
    "thus , a step frequency radar transmits an effectively wideband signal that does not suffer from low snr problems .",
    "an extension of @xcite to joint angle - doppler - range estimation would be straightforward ; however , it would involve prohibitively high complexity . in this paper",
    ", we propose an approach to obtain angle - doppler - range information in a decoupled fashion , which results in significant complexity reduction . in @xcite ,",
    "a decoupled angle - doppler estimation approach was proposed for the case of slowly moving targets . in that case",
    ", we can assume that the doppler shift varies between pulses but within each pulse remains approximately constant .",
    "based on compressively collected observations during one pulse , one can obtain initial estimates of the azimuth angles by discretizing the angle space only .",
    "then , doppler information is extracted by combining the data of multiple pulses .",
    "the basis matrix requires a discretization of the doppler space only for the initial angle estimates . in this paper",
    ", we apply a similar idea to decouple the estimation of angle , doppler and range .",
    "we propose to transmit a pulse train with constant carrier frequency , followed by a pulse train with carrier frequency that varies between pulses . based on the received data during the first pulse train one",
    "can decouple angle and doppler estimation along the lines of @xcite .",
    "based on these initial angle - doppler estimates , the range information can be extracted from the data corresponding to pulses that have varying frequency .",
    "the proposed method significantly reduces the complexity as compared to the joint angle - doppler - range estimation using cs without suffering performance degradation .",
    "let us consider the same setting as in @xcite .",
    "assume @xmath1 point targets and colocated antennas randomly distributed in a small area .",
    "the nodes transmit periodic pulses .",
    "the @xmath5-th target is at azimuth angle @xmath6 and moves with constant radial speed @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8/@xmath9 denote the location of the @xmath10-th transmit / receive node in polar coordinates . the number of transmit nodes and receive nodes is denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the range of the @xmath5-th target at time @xmath14 . under the far - field assumption ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath15 , the distance between the @xmath10th transmit / receive node and the @xmath5-th target @xmath16/@xmath17 can be approximated as @xmath18 where @xmath19 .    assuming that there are @xmath20 jammers located at @xmath21 and there is no clutter , the compressive samples collected by the @xmath22-th antenna during the @xmath23-th pulse are given by @xmath24 where    1 .",
