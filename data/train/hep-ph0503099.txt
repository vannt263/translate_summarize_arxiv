    "the parton distributions in hadrons play a very important role in particle physics .",
    "cross - sections for hard processes involving incoming hadrons can , based on the factorization theorems of qcd  @xcite , be calculated as a convolution of the parton distributions with parton level cross - sections calculated using perturbation theory .",
    "the parton distributions are universal in the sense that each hadron has a unique parton structure which can be used to calculate all hard processes involving that hadron .",
    "the normal interpretation of a parton distribution @xmath1 is as the probability to find a parton @xmath2 ( quark of some flavor or gluon ) with a fraction @xmath0 of the hadron momentum when probed by the momentum transfer @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence is very successfully described in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) by the @xmath4 evolution equations  @xcite , which means that , given the input distributions in @xmath0 at a scale @xmath5 large enough for pqcd to be applicable , one can calculate the distributions at any higher @xmath3 .",
    "however , this starting @xmath0-shape , which depends on non - perturbative qcd dynamics of the bound state hadron , has not yet been successfully derived from first principles .",
    "instead they are obtained by fitting parameterizations to data , in particular structure function measurements in deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) , _ e.g._the cteq  @xcite and mrst  @xcite parameterizations .    here",
    "we present further developments of our phenomenological model @xcite used to derive the parton distributions from simple assumptions regarding the non - perturbative properties of the hadron .",
    "the basic idea is to define the valence parton momentum distributions in the hadron rest frame where we assume that they are described by spherically symmetric gaussians .",
    "the typical width of these distributions is a few hundred mev from the heisenberg uncertainty relation applied to the hadron size .",
    "sea partons are described through quantum fluctuations of the nucleon into baryon - meson pairs , having the same quantum numbers as the original nucleon , and the sea parton is identified with a valence parton in the fluctuation meson . through this mechanism ,",
    "asymmetries in the non - perturbative sea parton distributions naturally arise , such as the difference between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 distributions and an asymmetry in the momentum distribution of @xmath8 compared to @xmath9 .",
    "the explanation of asymmetries in the nucleon sea by fluctuations of the nucleon into baryon - meson pairs also occurs in `` meson cloud '' models as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "although the meson cloud models have an elaborate theoretical formalism ( see _ e.g._@xcite ) one is forced to introduce phenomenological parts in order to obtain numerical results that can describe data .",
    "this concerns the choice of form factor in the nucleon to baryon - meson ( @xmath10 ) splitting function and the parton distributions in both mesons and baryons .",
    "our model invoke similar hadronic fluctuations as a basic quantum phenomenon , but differs from meson cloud models in important aspects .",
    "we use gaussian momentum distributions both for hadrons in the fluctuations and for the partons in the hadrons , and the hadronic fluctuations are only considered at the low starting scale @xmath11 , where the starting parton densities are defined and then evolved using standard perturbative qcd evolution .",
    "thus , we have physically motivated parton momentum distributions in the nucleon as well as in the fluctuation hadrons , while meson cloud models usually use parameterizations .",
    "our model results in a complete set of parton density functions , which we compare with different experimental data sets giving insights into different aspects of the non - perturbative nucleon structure .    in section 2 we develop the details of the model and in section 3 we compare to the relevant experimental data as well as to conventional parameterizations of parton densities .",

    "therefore it is quite interesting to compare the experimental results for this distribution with the model results . as can be readily seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dubar]b , the pion distribution using the physical pion mass @xmath159 ( full line ) is too soft , peaking at @xmath160 , while the data peaks around @xmath161 .",
    "this can not be cured using a larger @xmath65 , as explained above , but rather indicates that one should use a larger effective pion mass . allowing this effective pion mass to be a free parameter in the fit",

    "[ fig : dubar ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that the points driving the fit are the small-@xmath0 @xmath142 data , which have the smallest errors .",

    ". one could be that we need to include a relatively large fraction of heavier mesons , such as the @xmath163 mesons , in our description .",
    "this would be in accordance with the finding of a large @xmath164 component in the study @xcite based on a meson cloud model .",
    "another explanation would be that since the pions have very non - typical hadron masses , the meson - baryon fluctuations involve more generic meson states , with the quantum numbers defined by the actual hadron states available , but with masses with some distribution which can be approximated with a meson mass of @xmath165 . in any case",
    ", the introduction of a larger pion mass without any other modifications of the model reduces the quality of the fit to the low-@xmath0 @xmath54 data described in sec .",
    "[ sec : f2 ] ( the effect is comparable to changing the value of @xmath99 by less than @xmath166 ) , which points to the need of introducing more assumptions and parameters to get a perfect description of all data . since our intention is not to get the best possible fit ( as conventional parton density parameterizations ) , we refrain from doing this without a physics motivation related to our model .",
    "another consequence of the model is an asymmetry between the strange and anti - strange quark @xmath0-distributions in the nucleon , an aspect that we did a special study of in @xcite and extend here .",
    "the reason for this asymmetry is that in fluctuations with open strangeness , the @xmath8 quark is found in the baryon while the @xmath9 quark is in the meson .",
    "since the baryon , due to its higher mass , has a harder @xmath167-spectrum than the meson , we get a harder @xmath0-spectrum for the @xmath8 quark then the @xmath9 .",
    "this effect persists in spite of the fact that the @xmath8 distribution in the @xmath94 peaks at lower @xmath168 than the @xmath169 distribution of the @xmath170 , see @xcite for examples of typical meson and baryon distributions from the model .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that all fluctuations including strangeness ( such as @xmath171 , @xmath172 ) can be implicitly included in the @xmath173-fluctuation .",
    "fluctuations where the @xmath174 pair is part of a meson wave function , thus giving a symmetric contribution , are neglected since they should be suppressed ( @xmath175 due to large mass and @xmath176 due to clebsch - gordan coefficients ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs]b .",
    "note that in this model the criterion that the nucleon should have zero total strangeness , @xmath177 , is automatically fulfilled , since all strange fluctuations have the same number of @xmath8 quarks in the baryon as @xmath9 quarks in the meson due to the sum rules modified for the hadrons in question .",
    "this normalization is not changed when the parton distributions of the fluctuation are convoluted with the distributions of the fluctuation hadrons in the nucleon ( except for the factor @xmath178 which is common to the baryon and the meson ) .",

    ", width=566 ]    since the normalization of the @xmath181 fluctuation can not be safely calculated , we take it as a free parameter which we fit to data from the ccfr collaboration @xcite on the averaged strange sea @xmath182 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sdata ] . here , perturbative qcd evolution to larger @xmath3 shifts the original @xmath8 and @xmath169 distributions to smaller @xmath0 and adds a symmetric sea arising from @xmath183 .",

    "@xcite and the meson cloud model study in @xcite .",
    "this normalization of the non - perturbative strange quark sea means that the coefficient @xmath186 has essentially been scaled down with the fluctuation time @xmath187 relative to the light sea .",
    "this is a smaller suppression than @xmath188 that one might have expected based on old - fashioned perturbation theory . on the other hand ,",
    "this @xmath174 suppression is of similar magnitude as the ratio @xmath189 of the probabilities for quark - antiquark production in phenomenological hadronization models , such as the lund model @xcite . given that both cases concern non - perturbative @xmath174 pair production in a color field , this need not be surprising but indicate common features .",

    "a number of possible explanations @xcite for this discrepancy have been suggested , both in terms of extensions to the standard model and in terms of effects within the standard model .",
    "one explanation within the standard model is that , since the neutrinos and anti - neutrinos interact differently with @xmath8 and @xmath200 quarks , an asymmetry @xmath201 shifts the nutevresult . in order to facilitate the calculation of such a shift ,",
    "nutev  has published a folding function @xmath194 @xcite , to account for their analysis and give the shift in the extracted value of @xmath196 , where the parton densities are to be calculated at @xmath191 . using this",
    ", we get the shift @xmath202 , corresponding to a reduction of the significance of the anomaly with one standard deviation . our results for @xmath203 and @xmath204 are shown in fig .",

    "this reduces the anomaly to between @xmath208 and @xmath209 away from the standard model value .",
    "this important topic has been investigated previously .",
    "on the theoretical side we note that it has recently been shown @xcite that higher order perturbative effects give a negative contribution to @xmath205 , although significantly smaller than our positive non - perturbative effect . within the meson cloud model of @xcite , based on exponentially suppressed @xmath210 fluctuations , an inconclusive result on the sign of @xmath205 was obtained and a strange sea that was too small to affect the nutev anomaly .",
    "the meson cloud model in @xcite obtained that the @xmath8 quark has the softer spectrum than the @xmath9 , corresponding to a negative @xmath205 . using a light - cone two - body wave function model applied to @xmath210 fluctuations @xcite , a positive result similar to ours",
    "was obtained in @xcite , and in @xcite an even larger reduction of the anomaly than ours was found using an effective chiral quark model . unfortunately ,",
    "none of these studies provide comparisons with the measured strange sea , making the significance of their results difficult to assess .",
    "the experimental situation is at present unclear . in @xcite ,",
    "a positive @xmath205 was favored based on several earlier experiments , whereas nutev @xcite obtains the opposite sign based on their own data .",
    "however , the global analysis in @xcite of the @xmath78 asymmetry , including the nutev data as well as the ccfr data and using a very general functional form for @xmath211 , gives a best fit value for the asymmetry @xmath205 of the same magnitude and sign as ours .",
    "it is clear that an asymmetry in the strange quark sea of the nucleon arises naturally in models where non - perturbative sea quark distributions originate from hadronic fluctuations of the nucleon . our model , which reproduces the measured strange sea , reduces the nutev anomaly to a level which does not give a significant indication of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "let us first note that it is a non - trivial result that the many different data sets shown above can be well described by a model with only the eight parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : params ] ) .",
    "the model provides all the different parton distributions in @xmath0 at @xmath11 , _",
    "@xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath8 , @xmath169 .",
    "this is achieved with only four shape parameters ( the @xmath217 s ) and three normalization parameters ( the @xmath218 s ) , _ i.e. _  significantly fewer shape and normalization parameters than distributions .",
    "the simplest possible conventional parameterization based on counting rules @xcite , @xmath219 , can not be as economic in the number of parameters and still allow different shapes of different sea distributions . considering only valence and light sea distributions and neglecting the strange sea",
    ", we were able to get reasonable fits of the same data sets with eight free parameters ( when applying the constraints in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flavoursumrule],[eq : mom - sumrule ] ) ) .",
    "however , the fitted values for the exponents @xmath220 for the sea quarks and the gluon turn out more than twice as large as expected from the counting rules ( using the expected values gives a poor description of the data ) . with our model",
    "we obtain a generally better description of the data , which is achieved with fewer parameters .",
    "moreover , a physically motivated model whose parameters have a physical interpretation can give new insights about the unknown non - perturbative qcd dynamics embodied in the parton distributions .",
    "the standard parameterizations of parton densities , such as cteq  @xcite and mrst  @xcite , have many more parameters ( typically @xmath221 for the @xmath0-shapes and additional ones for normalizations ) and provide high - quality fits to large sets of different kinds of data .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to compare the parton densities resulting from our model with such standard parameterizations .",

    "note the different scales on the axes of ( a ) and ( b ) and that the gluon distributions are divided by 3 to fit in the plot.,width=604 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf - cteq ] we show our parton densities together with the uncertainty band of the cteq6 m distributions @xcite at the low scale @xmath222 .",
    "several features of the plot are striking :    1 .   for large and intermediate @xmath0 ,",
    "our valence quark as well as sea quark distributions from the model agree quite well with those from cteq6 m .",
    "our gluon distribution is slightly lower at large @xmath0 and much larger at small @xmath0 .",
    "3 .   for small @xmath223 the quark and anti - quark distributions of cteq",
    "are clearly higher , and growing faster as @xmath224 .",
    "the last two points are connected ; if there is a deficit in low-@xmath0 sea quarks of non - perturbative origin in our model , this must be compensated by perturbatively generated sea quarks from @xmath225 in the pqcd evolution in order to fit hera @xmath54 data .",
    "this requires a large gluon density at small @xmath0 and a low starting scale @xmath5 , which combined with the momentum sum rule eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom - sumrule ] ) gives the low width @xmath99 of the gluon distribution . if instead of using next - to - leading order qcd evolution equations , we use only leading order ones , then the evolution is slower which makes the fit to data prefer an even lower starting scale @xmath11 and a still more peaked gluon distribution at small @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _  a smaller @xmath99 , in order to develop a large enough @xmath226 sea at low @xmath0 .",
    "thus , these two model parameters depend on the order used in the perturbative evolution , whereas the other parameters are not affected much .",
    "furthermore , a less good fit to data is obtained with the leading order evolution .",
    "the gaussian momentum fluctuations in our model leads to parton number densities that go to a constant as @xmath227 and hence momentum densities going to zero as @xmath227 .",
    "the increase of the momentum distributions at @xmath227 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf - cteq ] is thus caused by pqcd evolution from the starting scale @xmath5 , which is forced to be very low .",
    "we can not , however , get a sea quark distribution rising as fast as the @xmath228-shape obtained by cteq ( as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : pdf - cteq]b ) at their @xmath229 , without an accompanying rise in the @xmath230 density .",
    "this indicates that , besides meson - baryon fluctuations , there is some additional source of @xmath158-pairs .",
    "one possibility , which seems quite natural , would be a non - perturbative `` gluon splitting '' process similar to the one in pqcd evolution .",
    "however , the precise form and effect of such a process is not known .",
    "such a contribution would nt have any large effect on the asymmetries studied in this work , since the asymmetry data are found at larger @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore we have chosen not to complicate our model by further assumptions and parameters to add such a conceivable component .",
    "we have presented a model based on gaussian momentum fluctuations and hadronic fluctuations of baryons into baryon - meson pairs .",
    "the resulting parton momentum distributions describes a wealth of data surprisingly well in view of the simplicity of the model . in this study , we have focused on different asymmetries of quark distributions in the proton ; most notably the @xmath46@xmath91 asymmetry obtained from the @xmath100 forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron and the @xmath216@xmath215 asymmetry measured in @xmath144 and @xmath145 scattering . from the phenomenological success of the model we can draw some overall conclusions :    * the gaussian , based on the law of large numbers , used for the momentum distribution may justify a statistical description of the non - perturbative forces confining partons in hadrons .",
    "* asymmetries in the quark sea can be explained by hadronic fluctuations , such as @xmath231      * the difference in shape between the @xmath46 and @xmath91 valence distributions of the proton corresponds to a difference in the widths of their momentum distributions , which may be interpreted as a difference in the spacial region available due to pauli blocking .",
    "* comparison with the experimental result for the distribution of @xmath147 indicates that a larger effective mass is needed for the pion in the @xmath136 states , which may be interpreted as an effective way of also including fluctuations with heavier mesons . * besides fluctuations into hadronic states , some other mechanism seems to be needed to explain the rise in the sea @xmath158-distributions as @xmath227 , used in standard parameterizations of parton distributions . *",
    "an asymmetry between the strange and anti - strange nucleon sea is unavoidable , although the magnitude of the asymmetry @xmath232 can not be stated more precisely than @xmath233 .",
    "this reduces the nutev anomaly from three to about two standard deviations , leaving no significant indication for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "although our model invoke similar basic hadronic fluctuations as in meson cloud models , it differs in important aspects , primarily concerning the basis for the momentum distributions of both the hadrons in the fluctuations and the partons in the hadrons . as discussed above ,",
    "our model is also more economical in terms of using fewer parameters than even the simplest parameterizations of parton densities .",
    "our model provides the parton distributions for all light quarks , as well as the strange sea and gluons , with altogether only four parameters giving the @xmath0-shapes and three parameters for normalizations .",
    "finally , we note that this model could be used to develop a library of parton density functions for more general usage .",
    "so far , we have not done this since our intention has not been high precision functions to be folded with parton level cross - sections in practical calculations . instead",
    ", our primary aim has been to gain understanding of the non - perturbative qcd dynamics of the bound state nucleon that is embodied in the parton density functions at the low scale @xmath11 , which are otherwise just parameterized .",
