    "therefore , as we replace realistic electron motion by a motion along the links of a network , the dimensionless lattice constant should be chosen as @xmath428 .    in our p - q network fig .",
    "[ pqnetwork ] , in addition to junctions ( strong scatterers ) there are point contacts on the links .",
    "the role that these point contacts play is the following .",
    "our junctions fig .",
    "[ pqnetwork ] do not provide _ any _ backscattering .",
    "more precisely , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ pqnetwork ] , an electron starting along a given link , say , to the right , after several scatterings off the junctions , will never return to the starting point from the left .",
    "thus , the junctions alone can not model the interference effects in realistic electron gas , where the probability of such a return is @xmath429 .",
    "it is the point contacts that provide possibility of backscattering in the p - q network , and parameter @xmath129 is chosen @xmath430 in order to model the realistic return probability .    from the above reasoning",
    ", the diagonal conductivity of the p - q model is @xmath431 . in a finite magnetic field ,",
    "estimate for @xmath30 can be found from eq .",
    "( [ hrq ] ) : @xmath432 note now , that the boundary of delocalization transition established in the present paper , is @xmath433 with @xmath434 .",
    "then we conclude from eq .",
    "( [ bv ] ) that transition occurs when the `` boltzmann '' value of @xmath30 is @xmath98 . on the other hand",
    ", levitation scenario is based on the conjecture that the classical @xmath247 does not get renormalized upon increasing the sample size , see eqs .",
    "( [ pru1 ] ) , ( [ pru2 ] ) .",
    "consistency between delocalization condition within p - q model and within scaling theory @xcite can be viewed as evidence that the p - q model adequately captures microscopic physics behind the levitation scenario .",
    "there is a fundamental reason why the picture of the weak - field quantum hall transition is much more complex than the picture of the strong - field transition .",
    "namely , for strong - field transition there is an _ exact duality _ of electron states above and below critical energy .",
    "by contrast , there is no such inherent duality in the weak - field transition .",
    "this , in particular , does not allow to employ the quantum real - space renormalization group approach @xcite to describe this transition analytically .",
    "duality with respect to the center , @xmath354 , of the landau level in the cc model insures that , with a strong spread in the saddle - point heights , the scaling region narrows , but delocalized state remains at @xmath354 .",
    "a remarkable outcome of our numerics is that the same property holds for the weak - field transition : we have verified that , upon introducing a strong spread in the local values of the backscattering strength , @xmath129 , but keeping @xmath435 fixed , does not effect the position , @xmath198 , of the transition point . on the other hand , upon increasing the spread in the local values of @xmath129 , interference effects become progressively less relevant .",
    "this allowed us to uncover a transparent _ classical _ picture of the low - field quantum hall transition , see figs .",
    "[ trajectories ] , [ diffph ] , which is a counterpart of the percolation picture of the strong - field transition @xcite . the fact that levitation emerges both within the p - q model and from the scaling equations eqs .",
    "( [ pru1 ] ) , ( [ pru2 ] ) , still does not mean that the p - q model offers a microscopic support for the pruisken theory .",
    "after all , phenomenon of levitation follows from a general argument that delocalized states have nowhere to go but up in the vanishing magnetic field .",
    "in fact , scaling equations eqs .",
    "( [ pru1 ] ) , ( [ pru2 ] ) suggest a stronger message : namely , positions of delocalized states do not change if magnetic field does not exercise any `` phase '' action . neglecting the phase action corresponds to replacement of the first term in eq .",
    "( [ pru1 ] ) by a constant .",
    "we emphasize that the p - q model supports this prediction of the pruisken theory .",
    "this is reflected in the coincidence ( within accuracy of our numerics ) of the p - q boundary with and without trs .    in closing",
    ", we list the questions which were previously addressed in the frame of fully chiral cc model and are also pertinent to the weakly chiral p - q model :    ( _ i _ ) .",
    "two - channel network models of cc type were studied in refs . in connection with spin - orbit induced splitting of quantum hall transition @xcite , disorder - induced `` attraction '' of delocalized states from different landau levels @xcite and quantum hall transition in disordered superconductors @xcite .",
    "all these considerations are based on two _ co - propagating _",
    "channels on each link . in p - q model ,",
    "the two channels are _ counter - propagating _ and spinless",
    ". it would be interesting to incorporate spin - orbit coupling into the p - q model for the following reason .",
    "in zero magnetic field and in the presence of spin - orbit coupling there is a critical energy above which electron states are delocalized @xcite . on the other hand , in strong magnetic fields , spin - orbit coupling splits discrete delocalized states @xcite . upon decreasing the magnetic field ,",
    "both delocalized states are most likely to head towards zero - field metal - insulator transition point . microscopic model describing",
    "this scenario must include orbital action of magnetic field , spin - orbit coupling , and interference effects .",
    "this can be accomplished upon incorporating spin degree of freedom into the p - q model . a possible application of the above physics is graphene in a weak magnetic filed @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the inter - valley scattering plays the role of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "( _ ii _ ) . in three dimensional layered system in zero magnetic field , arbitrarily weak coupling between the layers delocalizes electron states above a certain critical energy . in strong magnetic field , a weak interlayer coupling smear discrete delocalized state into metallic band @xcite .",
    "matching of these two scenarios takes place in weak magnetic fields .",
    "the p - q model based description can be employed in this domain .",
    "( _ iii _ ) .",
    "interaction - induced dephasing @xcite is crucial for experimental observability of levitation , since the transition is smeared when localization radius exceeds the dephasing length .",
    "the issue closely related to dephasing is a peculiar behavior of the non - diagonal resistivity , @xmath436 , in the vicinity of the high - field transition @xcite .",
    "the question about behavior of @xmath436 near the low - field transition point can be asked and addressed within `` incoherent '' p - q model .",
    "in addition , the question about interplay of disorder and interaction previously studied for high - field transition @xcite , can be redirected to the low - field transition .",
    "( _ iv _ ) .",
    "it is known that there is an intimate relation between delocalization transition in cc model and critical behavior of superspin chains @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate wether the p - q model corresponds to any spin model .",
    "it is also known that cc model is related to the dirac hamiltonian with disorder @xcite .",
    "recall that at degeneracy point , @xmath167 , @xmath169 , the p - q model falls into two independent cc models .",
    "modification of the mixing of two counter - propagating channels on the links transforms the p - q model with @xmath169 to the model studied in ref . .",
    "this modification leads to criticality which was studied within the sigma - model approach @xcite . it would be interesting to investigate such a modification of the p - q model away from the degeneracy point .",
    "more specifically , the case @xmath437 , in our p - q model , differs from the model ref .",
    "primarily in the scattering matrix of junctions . our junction matrix eq .",
    "( [ matrixq ] ) describes scattering , say , to the right , with the _ same _ probability @xmath125 for all incoming channels , while the nodes in ref .",
    "describe scattering to the right with the probability @xmath125 from two opposite channels , and with the probability @xmath177 from the other two opposite channels . in terms of coupling of counter - propagating channels on the links , in ref .",
    "this coupling differs from our link matrix in following respects : to get the coupling of ref .",
    "one should replace in eq .",
    "( [ tmatrix ] ) the phases @xmath82 should all be put zero , while @xmath438 satisfy the relation @xmath439 , @xmath440 , which is different even from the case with trs in the p - q model .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with i. gruzberg . this work was supported by the bsf grant no .",
    "2006201 . one of us ( v. k. ) appreciates the hospitality of the mpi - pks in dresden , where significant part of his work was done .",
    "the easiest way to derive eq .",
    "( [ mfp ] ) is to notice that with respect to the motion along the diagonal direction of network the diffusion has , effectively , a one - dimensional character @xcite .",
    "this is because the motion along the diagonal can be viewed as a random sequence of transmissions and reflections without deflections . for a given site , the full probability of transmission along the diagonal direction ( say , up and to the right ) is @xmath441 , while the full probability of reflection is @xmath442 .",
    "parameter @xmath53 should be identified with ratio , @xmath443 .",
    "together with flux - conservation condition , @xmath444 , this ratio reduces to eq .",
    "( [ mfp ] ) .    as we pointed out in section",
    "ii , the point @xmath445 is singular : strong localization predicted by scaling theory with boltzmann result eq .",
    "( [ mfp ] ) as an initial condition , contradicts to the result of ref . .",
    "this contradiction can be resolved from the following reasoning .",
    "note , that the classical motion of electron is very different in the above two realizations . in the case",
    "( _ i _ ) this motion is diffusive",
    ". then interference will readily localize this motion .",
    "the case ( _ ii _ ) corresponds to classical percolation threshold . to see this , notice , that the electron predominantly travels in loops ( clusters ) and one trajectory is the infinite cluster spanning the entire system . in fact",
    ", it can be easily seen that possible trajectories belong to two decoupled bond - percolation networks .",
    "interference will transform these networks to two cc models at the delocalization - transition points .",
    "since the percolative picture is fully coherent , it captures properly the quantum delocalization , while `` dephased '' boltzmann picture does not .",
    "note that in the case @xmath447 but @xmath448 not equal to @xmath75 , prediction of the scaling theory that the boltzmann result governs localization properties at large distances is correct .",
    "although with a strong spread in local @xmath63-values , when the network still breaks into two cc networks , the states of both cc networks are localized with localization radius , @xmath449 .",
