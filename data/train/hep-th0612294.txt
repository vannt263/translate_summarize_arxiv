    "the exact renormalization group ( erg ) was introduced by k.  g.  wilson as a proper language to define continuum limits in quantum field theory .",
    "@xcite a key ingredient is the theory space @xmath1 .",
    "given a set of fields , it consists of all possible theories ( i.e. , lagrangians or actions ) with the same cutoff ( or defined on the same lattice ) . a renormalization group ( rg ) transformation acts on @xmath1 , and it consists of two steps :    1 .   integrating out high momentum modes 2 .   rescaling space to restore the same cutoff    we incorporate short - distance physics into the action , leaving long - distance physics for further integration of field variables .",
    "starting from a theory , rg transformations generate a flow of theories along which the same physics is kept .",
    "only the physical momentum scale of the cutoff becomes smaller along the flow . in this setup ,",
    "the continuum limits form a finite dimensional subspace @xmath2 of @xmath1 .",
    "it is centered around a fixed point , and its dimension is given by the number of relevant ( or renormalized ) parameters .",
    "the continuum limits can be obtained as the long distance limit of theories finely tuned to criticality . using physical units ,",
    "this prescription defines the limit of the infinite uv cutoff .",
    "rg transformations of the renormalized parameters are obtained simply by restricting erg on @xmath3 .",
    "it was polchinski who first introduced erg into perturbative field theory.@xcite polchinski s erg gives a concrete realization of wilson s erg , but it differs from wilson s in two aspects :    1 .",
    "no rescaling of space 2 .",
    "artificial splitting of the action into the free and interacting parts    the first point is not essential since we can easily modify polchinski s erg to incorporate rescaling .",
    "the second point is an unavoidable nature of perturbation theory .",
    "in fact a more serious difference lies elsewhere . to be concrete ,",
    "let us consider @xmath0 theory in four dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the ( perturbatively ) renormalized theory has two parameters , which we can take as a squared mass @xmath4 and a coupling @xmath5 .",
    "hence , @xmath3 is two dimensional , and therefore we need only one parameter to distinguish various erg flows .",
    "but this is not the case in polchinski s erg . in sect .",
    "[ asymptotic ] we will show that the action satisfying polchinski s erg differential equation depends on three parameters @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the cutoff , decreasing along each erg flow .",
    "the momentum scale @xmath9 is introduced as the scale where @xmath10 are defined .",
    "the two flows @xmath11 correspond to different choices of mass units , and they are trivially equivalent .",
    "let us denote the beta function of @xmath5 as @xmath12 , and the anomalous dimension of @xmath4 as @xmath13 .",
    "then , for an infinitesimal @xmath14 , the flow @xmath15 is physically equivalent to the flow @xmath6 , but the problem is that the two solutions @xmath16 do not overlap .",
    "it is easy to see why .",
    "the erg differential equation depends on @xmath4 explicitly , and the two solutions solve two different erg differential equations .",
    "it is this redundancy of parameters which characterizes polchinski s erg .",
    "this makes the derivation of @xmath17 not straightforward for polchinski s erg .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first we show how a momentum scale @xmath9 enters the solution of polchinski s erg equations .",
    "this is done in sects .  2 , 3 , 4 .",
    "second we derive @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the anomalous dimension @xmath20 of the scalar field in the framework of polchinski s erg .",
    "our derivation relies on the technique of composite operators . by studying the @xmath9 dependence of the action",
    ", we will show how @xmath21 arise naturally from erg .",
    "all this is done in sects .  5 , 6 , 7 .",
    "not long after polchinski s work , hughes and liu have looked at the relation between erg and rg.@xcite besides some technicalities , the main difference from the present work is that they have overlooked the difference between wilson s and polchinski s erg .",
    "this neglect makes their results valid only at the lowest non - trivial orders in perturbation theory .    in an unpublished work",
    "@xcite we have obtained the same results for @xmath21 using polchinski s erg .",

    "the use of a finite ultraviolet cutoff @xmath8 is compensated , however , by the presence of an infinite number of interaction terms . each interaction vertex @xmath38 results from the integration over field momenta larger than @xmath8 , and it is local in the sense that it can be expanded in powers of @xmath4 and external momenta if they are small compared to appropriate powers of @xmath8 . in the extreme limit @xmath41",
    ", @xmath38 reduces to the connected @xmath42-point correlation function .",

    "this requirement translates into polchinski s differential equation @xcite @xmath44 \\label{pol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation assures that the correlation functions , calculated with @xmath43 , are independent of @xmath8 . to be more precise",
    ", the following combinations do not depend on @xmath8 : @xmath45 for the two - point , and @xmath46 for the higher - point functions @xmath47 . despite the use of a finite ultraviolet cutoff",
    ", the action can contain physics of momentum scales up to the highest @xmath8 for which @xmath22 is well defined .",
    "a standard way of solving ( [ pol ] ) is by imposing a set of initial conditions at a large cutoff @xmath48 . in @xcite polchinski",
    "showed the possibility of choosing initial conditions such that @xmath49 , for any finite @xmath8 , has a limit as @xmath50 .",
    "( this was shown , of course , within perturbation theory . ) for example , we can adopt the following mass independent form : @xmath51 @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are all given as power series in @xmath5 whose coefficients depend logarithmically on @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath9 is an arbitrary finite momentum scale .",
    "it is not only necessary to render the argument of the logarithm dimensionless , but it also acquires an important physical interpretation as the scale where the renormalized parameters @xmath54 are defined .    to understand better how @xmath9 enters the continuum limit , let us look at the one - loop two - point vertex . solving ( [ pol ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath55 where the last double integral on the right - hand side is finite as @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath57 to have a finite limit as @xmath56 , we can take @xmath58 so that @xmath59 in the continuum limit .",
    "note that @xmath60 can not depend on @xmath8 since it gives an initial condition to the differential equation ( [ pol ] ) which determines the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath57 .",
    "we are thus obliged to introduce @xmath9 to make sense of the logarithm of @xmath48 for @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , the choice @xmath62 makes the continuum limit of @xmath63 finite .",
    "arbitrary finite constants can be added to @xmath61 , @xmath53 , @xmath64 , amounting to further finite renormalization .",
    "the dependence of the theory on an arbitrary momentum scale @xmath9 is familiar from the standard renormalization theory . in the above",
    "we have adopted a minimal scheme in which the expansions of @xmath65 have at least one power of @xmath66 , with no part independent of @xmath66 . giving a different value to @xmath9 amounts to finite renormalization .",
    "this permits us to interpret @xmath9 as the scale where the renormalized parameters @xmath67 are defined .",
    "unless we choose to parameterize @xmath68 in terms of physical parameters such as a physical squared mass and a physical coupling , the introduction of @xmath9 is inevitable .",
    "there is another way of solving ( [ pol ] ) , which is more convenient for relating erg to the rg of renormalized parameters .",
    "we first note that perturbative renormalizability amounts to @xmath69 for @xmath70 . besides the squared mass @xmath4 that appears in the erg equation ( [ pol ] ) itself , the solutions depend on a coupling parameter @xmath5 .",
    "hence , we can write the vertices in the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath9 is a momentum scale introduced to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the vertices . expanding in powers of @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "we obtain @xmath75 similarly , we obtain @xmath76 the parts represented by dots are proportional to inverse powers of @xmath8 , and vanish in the limit @xmath77 .    at each order of @xmath5 ,",
    "the asymptotic parts of the vertices are given as finite degree polynomials of @xmath78 .",
    "the coefficients of a polynomial , say @xmath79 , depend on the choice of @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the coefficient of the constant term , @xmath80 , can be made to vanish by choosing a particular value for @xmath9 .",
    "the erg differential equation specifies only the @xmath8 dependence of the vertices .",
    "hence , the @xmath8 independent parts of @xmath81 do not get fixed uniquely .",
    "one way of removing the ambiguity is to adopt the following conditions @xcite : @xmath82 we call this ms ( minimal subtraction ) , since it resembles the ms scheme for dimensional regularization .",

    "let us recall that in the ms scheme for dimensional regularization , the @xmath9 dependence of the the correlation functions is canceled by compensating @xmath9 dependence of @xmath10 , and field normalization .",
    "this is how the beta functions of @xmath10 are derived . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we wish to do the same for the ms solutions of polchinski s equation .",
    "this is an appropriate place to comment on the work of hughes and liu @xcite .",
    "they parameterize the action using three parameters : @xmath90 a solution to ( [ pol ] ) is specified by the conditions at @xmath91 : @xmath92 @xmath93 obviously corresponds to our @xmath9 .",
    "there are two problems .",
    "one , which is crucial , is that the dependence of the action on the choice of @xmath93 is neglected .",
    "the other is that this is not a mass independent scheme ; the three parameters depend on @xmath4 non - trivially .",
    "approximate mass independence is obtained by taking @xmath94 very large compared to @xmath4 . from the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath95 ,",
