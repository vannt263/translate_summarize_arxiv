    "there has been a recent surge of interest in extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) by higher - dimension operators  @xcite .",
    "these can have an important impact on the higgs sector , alleviating in particular the tension present in the mssm that results from the lep higgs bounds .",
    "such effective field theory ( eft ) studies allow a model - independent description of a large class of extensions of the mssm , and permit one to quantify the sense in which the higgs sector can serve as a window beyond the mssm ( bmssm ) .",
    "this point of view was clearly put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was emphasized that at leading order in @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scale of the physics that is integrated out the mssm is extended by only two parameters .",
    "the surprisingly large effects of such higher - dimension operators can be understood from the fact that the mssm higgs potential is rather restricted at tree - level .",
    "the nonrenormalizable operators in the superpotential induce renormalizable ( quartic ) operators in the higgs potential that are not present in the mssm limit ( at tree - level ) , so that in spite of the fact that their coefficients are `` small '' of order @xmath2 they correspond to qualitatively new effects .",
    "in fact , the operators thus induced can easily `` destabilize '' the mssm - like minimum and lead to new minima that exist only as a direct result of the higher - dimension operators ( i.e. the heavy physics ) .",
    "it was emphasized in @xcite that such minima can be phenomenologically viable , can be studied within the eft framework , and can explain the distinct properties induced by the heavy physics on the higgs sector .",
    "if the bmssm physics is sufficiently heavy , the leading order analysis at order @xmath0 can suffice .",
    "however , it is perfectly possible that @xmath1 is not too far from the electroweak ( ew ) scale , and that nevertheless the heavy physics may not be easy to see directly at the lhc , even if it is within its kinematic reach ( e.g. heavy singlets that couple only through the higgs sector ) . in such cases ,",
    "the eft approach is still useful to describe the properties of the mssm higgs sector .",
    "it turns out that the effects of order @xmath3 are more important than naively expected .",
    "this observation also finds a simple explanation in the structure of the mssm tree - level higgs potential  @xcite together with the smallness of the mssm tree - level quartic couplings ( the root cause for a higgs state lighter than the @xmath4 mass in the mssm at tree - level ) .",
    "the crucial point is that the leading order contributions to a subset of the quartic higgs operators , from the heavy physics , first enter at order @xmath3 .",
    "thus , these end up correcting a coefficient of order @xmath5 instead of a @xmath0 effect , and can give a relevant correction even if the expansion parameter is relatively small .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to appreciate that the fact that the first two orders in the expansion in @xmath0 can even result in comparable contributions to the higgs masses , in no way implies a breakdown of the eft .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a detailed study of the consequences for the higgs masses and couplings up to order @xmath3 was given , and a selected number of phenomenological observations were already made , such as : enhanced gluon fusion production cross sections in a large number of cases , and the presence of `` exotic '' decay modes with more than one higgs boson in the decay chain . in this work",
    "we analyze the constraints from lep and the tevatron on the neutral higgs bosons , as well as the charged higgs bounds from lep  .",
    "we also expand on the associated collider phenomenology , emphasizing the type of signals that can be expected at both the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we point out that due to the large corrections to the higgs masses ( especially to the cp - even higgs bosons ) the production and decay patterns can be markedly different from those in the mssm .",
    "examples include models where both cp even higgs bosons have significant branching fractions into gauge bosons , thus giving rise to spectacular signals such as two clearly defined peaks in the di - lepton invariant mass distribution . in addition , we observe new decay chains that allow for production of the `` nonstandard '' higgs bosons without large @xmath6 enhancements .",
    "it is possible that the full two - higgs - doublet - model ( 2hdm ) content can be mapped in detail , thus providing a clear and definite signal for physics beyond the standard model , and a rather detailed understanding of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "if , in addition , relatively light superparticle signals are observed , as might be expected in these scenarios , a clear case for bmssm physics could be established .",
    "apart from the collider phenomenology induced indirectly by the heavy physics , higher - dimension operators have also been studied in the context of dark matter  @xcite , cosmology  @xcite and ew baryogenesis  @xcite , and it may be interesting to further explore the connections with collider physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] , we summarize the most relevant aspects of the models under study . in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] we discuss the modifications of the higgs spectrum , which are the dominant factor in determining the higgs collider phenomenology . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss in detail the range of signatures uncovered by our survey , separating the analysis into the low and large @xmath6 regimes .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "as already mentioned , when considering bmssm scenarios where the non - mssm degrees of freedom have masses parametrically larger than the weak scale , an eft approach is very useful . the fact that at leading order only two parameters are added to those in the mssm makes this a rather economic extension  @xcite , that nevertheless can significantly change the mssm higgs phenomenology .",
    "however , the same reason that makes these @xmath0 suppressed effects rather important also implies that the next order in the @xmath0 expansion can be phenomenologically relevant , without implying a breakdown of the eft  @xcite . at order @xmath3",
    "there are several susy - preserving and susy - violating operators in the  potential , the most important of which , in relation to the higgs phenomenology , were listed in ref .",
    "we refer the reader to this reference for the detailed form of such operators and how they affect the expressions for the higgs masses and couplings . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to a few general remarks that summarize the most relevant features for the present study ( full details were given in the above reference ) .",
    "first , it has to be pointed out that the higher - dimension operators to order @xmath3 can be easily generated from uv completions that include a combination of higgs singlets , @xmath7 higgs triplets , heavy w primes and z primes . as argued in @xcite",
    "the upshot is that the coefficients of the higher - dimension operators , from a low - energy point of view , can be chosen in an uncorrelated manner .",
    "although the eft description to order @xmath3 introduces a large number of parameters , which makes the framework more involved compared to the truncation at order @xmath0 , one should notice that this same feature gives additional handles to infer properties of the heavy sector from the properties of the low - energy degrees of freedom . in any case ,",
    "since our goal is to survey the collider signal possibilities in a model - independent way ( in a supersymmetric framework ) , we focus on a low - energy study based on the eft at order @xmath3 , as described in  @xcite",
    ".     a random scan over parameter space was performed , and a set of points satisfying several constraints was selected .",
    "the set of points in this study satisfy :    * all the dimensionless coefficients parametrizing the higher - dimension operators are taken to be at most of order one , i.e. it is assumed that the heavy physics at @xmath1 is weakly coupled . *",
    "_ global minimum _ : since the scalar potential can present several minima , we make sure that the vacuum under study is the global one ( at least within the eft ) .",
    "we also check that there are no charge / color breaking minima , and for simplicity we restrict to the cp conserving case ( checking that the global minimum does not break cp spontaneously ) . * _ robustness _ : there are no accidental cancellations that can render ( not computed ) higher orders in the @xmath0 expansion more important than expected . * _ `` light '' susy spectrum _ : given that generically , and unlike in the mssm , these models satisfy the lep bounds on the higgs mass at tree - level , there is no need for large radiative corrections .",
    "naturalness suggests that in these models the susy spectrum would be expected to be light ( in the few hundred gev range , consistent with direct bounds ) . *",
    "agreement with ew precision constraints , in particular in regards to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath8 parameter  @xcite .",
    "these arise from three sources : a subset of the higher - dimension operators ( as generated , for instance , by higgs triplets ) , the details of the mssm higgs spectrum , and potential custodially - violating mass splittings in the sparticle spectrum .",
    "we emphasize that mild cancellations allow for higher - dimension operator effects that can have a non - negligible impact on the higgs collider phenomenology .",
    "all of the above constraints were described in detail in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we impose the current collider bounds from lep and the tevatron using the code higgsbounds v1.2.0 @xcite .   to this",
    "we add the lep bounds on charged higgs production @xcite , and the newest combined result from the tevatron in the ww channel @xcite , and in the inclusive tau search @xcite , that are not included in the currently available version of this code .",
    "we use higgsbounds in the `` effective coupling '' mode , which requires effective couplings defined by g_x^2 & = &  , [ geff ] where @xmath9 is any of the neutral higgs states , @xmath10 is the partial width in our model into any of the final states @xmath11 or @xmath12 ( when applicable ) , and @xmath13 is the partial width for a sm higgs of the corresponding mass .",
    "together with the total widths in our model ( and in the sm ) , these effective couplings encode the information about branching fractions into these decay channels in our model .",
    "we have implemented our tree - level expressions for the spectrum and higgs couplings in hdecay v3.4  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to compute the higgs partial decay widths , taking into account the qcd radiative corrections , that are known to be sizable ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we include the radiative corrections derived from the 1-loop rg improved effective potential due to supersymmetric particles  @xcite , and the susy qcd / ew corrections to the yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "loop contributions from the heavy physics that has been integrated out are suppressed by both a loop factor and by powers of @xmath1 , hence they are expected to be negligible .    in all the plots that follow ,",
    "we have fixed the following dimensionful parameters : @xmath14 , @xmath15 ,   gives the scale of susy breaking in the heavy sector .",
    "the detailed differences between the various susy - breaking operators are parametrized via @xmath16 dimensionless parameters over which we scan .",
    "see @xcite for complete details . ] and for simplicity , we use a common value @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the mssm sparticle sector .. ] the light superparticle spectrum implies that the loop contributions to the higgs masses are modest , while the loop contributions to the higgs couplings are more important and sensitive to the details of this spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the above choice of @xmath17 is simply meant to illustrate the possible loop effects arising from relatively light superparticles .",
    "in particular , one can expect the first two generation squarks to be somewhat heavier to satisfy direct collider bounds  @xcite or the sleptons could be somewhat lighter , without changing our generic conclusions regarding the higgs collider phenomenology .",
    "note also that the neutralino / chargino sector depends on parameters not affecting the higgs sector directly , and in particular that we do not impose constraints from dark matter ( in this work , we remain agnostic as to the identity of the dm candidate , but see  @xcite ) .",
    "we have also not imposed indirect constraints , such as those arising from @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , that have the potential to put important restrictions , but depend on the flavor structure of the soft susy - breaking parameters .",
    "we consider two representative values of @xmath6 : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the cp - odd mass was varied in the range @xmath24 .",
    "the upper bound is taken to ensure a proper separation between the light and heavy scales , as required by the eft analysis .",
    "the very low mass range is expected to be severely constrained , but we defer the study of such region to future work .",
    "we turn next to a detailed description of the most important physical characteristics of the set of models in the scan , starting with the higgs spectrum .",
    "in this section we study the spectra of these models , analyzing the modifications with respect to the mssm . compared to the results already presented in @xcite",
    ", we include the 1-loop supersymmetric corrections to the higgs quartic couplings as given in @xcite ( a minor effect for the relatively low susy spectrum we have in mind ) , as well as the constraints coming from collider data ( lep and tevatron ) .         in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlvsma ] we show the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs ( @xmath25 ) as a function of @xmath26 , for both @xmath27 ( left panel ) and @xmath28 ( right panel ) . the green points represent models ruled out by lep , while the magenta ones are excluded by current data from cdf and d0 .",
    "we divide the remaining allowed models into two subsets .",
    "first , one has those models that will be probed at the tevatron at 95 % c.l ( red points ) , assuming @xmath29 per experiment and @xmath30 efficiency improvements  @xcite  ( see @xcite for detailed projections in the mssm context ) .",
    "these comprise the future reach of two search channels : @xmath31 with the higgs being produced in association with electroweak gauge bosons , and @xmath32 .",
    "second , the blue points are those that will be out of the tevatron reach under the previous assumptions . for reference , we also show the mssm ( dashed ) curve , assuming the same light susy spectrum .",
    "this color code will be employed in all the plots .",
    "the corrections to @xmath33 due to the new physics are most important in the low @xmath34 regime .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that they can also be relevant at large @xmath34 .",
    "the higher - dimension operators affect @xmath33 in such a way that it can easily be above the mssm value .",
    "in the left plot , where @xmath27 , all the points lie above the mssm curve ; @xmath33 can reach values as high as @xmath35 .    moreover , the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mlvsma ] shows in a clear way how the tevatron probes these models . for high enough values of @xmath36 one",
    "distinguishes mostly uniformly single colored horizontal stripes .",
    "the magenta one , where @xmath37 , corresponds to @xmath25 being excluded by the current tevatron search in the @xmath38 channel  @xcite .",
    "note that this range is slightly larger than the sm one ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in our models , the gluon fusion cross section can be mildly enhanced with respect to the sm one . by the same token , one understands the presence of a few red points within the magenta stripe as those corresponding to models whose gluon fusion cross section is below the sm value . the two red stripes ( @xmath40 in the ranges @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) represent the future tevatron reach of the @xmath43 channel .",
    "notice also the presence of a thin stripe of red points , with @xmath33 around @xmath44 , that extends along a wide range of @xmath26 : these models can be probed by the @xmath45 channel , that is effective only for relatively low values of @xmath33 .",
    "no points are excluded by the @xmath46 decay mode , since @xmath47 is always much heavier than @xmath44 .",
    "the two blue stripes correspond to points where there is no reach from the tevatron in the @xmath38 channel .",
    "this can be explained either by a low signal due to the reduced branching fraction into gauge bosons , or simply because the @xmath48 parton luminosity is not enough to produce such a heavy higgs boson .",
    "note however that in the high @xmath40 blue region the @xmath49 channel becomes kinematically accessible , so that this higgs could be observed in the _ gold plated _ four - lepton mode at the lhc .",
    "we will postpone further comments on this region to the next section .",
    "regarding the lep constraints , one sees that there are a few currently allowed ( blue and red ) points below the sm lep bound of @xmath50@xcite .",
    "the nonexclusion is due to the fact that the coupling of @xmath25 to the gauge bosons is reduced with respect to the sm value .",
    "however , all the red points below the lep - bound can potentially be excluded in the @xmath51 channel .    for the remaining points ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the situation is more complex , and magenta , blue and red points coexist in this region . in particular , there is a region of allowed ( blue ) points with @xmath54 and relatively low @xmath26 .",
    "these points have suppressed branching fractions into both @xmath38 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 being the dominant decay channel .    in the case of @xmath28 ,",
    "the deviations from the mssm are far less dramatic .",
    "ultimately , this is explained by the fact that several higher - dimension operators are @xmath34 suppressed .",
    "however , @xmath33 can reach values as high as @xmath57 . in this case , since @xmath25 is sm - like , the lep bound is very strict , forcing @xmath33 to be above @xmath58 . regarding the tevatron searches , we see that there are two small and disjoint currently excluded ( magenta ) regions .",
    "the region with @xmath33 around @xmath59 corresponds , as in the low @xmath6 case , to exclusion based on the @xmath60 decay mode .",
    "the second magenta region has lower values of @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 ) .",
    "this latter set of models are currently excluded by the inclusive tau search with 2.2 fb@xmath63 , using the combination from cdf and d0  @xcite .",
    "this channel becomes important here , since the @xmath64 and in some cases the @xmath25 coupling to down - type fermions is @xmath34 enhanced .",
    "turning to the red points ( i.e. those within future tevatron sensitivity ) , a closer inspection reveals that all of them can be excluded due to the decay modes of the lightest higgs . in more detail ,",
    "the @xmath65 channel probes points with @xmath40 below @xmath66 , while the rest are probed by the @xmath60 search .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that , as in the mssm , in the large @xmath34 limit @xmath47 tends to be non sm - like .",
    "in contrast to the low @xmath34 case , all the tevatron allowed ( blue ) points correspond to somewhat heavy values of @xmath26 ( above @xmath67 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to study the relation between the cp - even higgs masses . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhvsml ] we show @xmath68 as a function of @xmath33 , for @xmath27 ( left panel ) and @xmath28 ( right panel ) . for most of the points",
    "these masses are not correlated .",
    "for instance , if in the left plot one takes @xmath33 in the @xmath69 range , then @xmath70 can vary between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "for @xmath27 , one has not only the ( now vertical ) stripes corresponding to exclusion due to @xmath25 that we have found in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlvsma ] : there are also horizontal stripes , corresponding to @xmath68 ranges where the tevatron is excluding models by means of the @xmath51 decay channel .",
    "this sheds some light into the region already mentioned in the discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : mlvsma ] with @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this region",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath47 can couple to @xmath38 , typically resulting in some suppression with respect to the sm for one or the other cp - even higgs boson .",
    "this constitutes an interesting example of how the @xmath25 and @xmath47 signals can complement each other .",
    "the right panel confirms what we have anticipated from our discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : mlvsma ] : in the large @xmath34 regime , @xmath68 tends to be heavy , and the decays of @xmath47 are less restrictive than the ones from @xmath25 , hence there are no horizontal stripes in this plot . as mentioned before , the @xmath25 search channels give rise to all the red points .         finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhiggsvsma ] the masses of the heavy cp - even and charged higgs bosons as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "the deviations from the mssm value are much less dramatic than for @xmath25 .",
    "this is particularly true in the large @xmath73 limit and for large @xmath74 .",
    "nonetheless , in this region the contribution from the new physics effects to the masses is of @xmath75 , which can not be neglected . for low values of @xmath34 ( left plots )",
    "we see that in the region of blue points with low values of @xmath26 , both @xmath76 and @xmath68 are above the mssm value .",
    "notice that this effect is more important for @xmath68 than for @xmath76 . as a direct consequence , in the low @xmath34 regime , new _",
    "exotic _ channels like @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be open , with large brs , as we will see in the next section .",
    "this does not happen for @xmath28 since , as stated before , there are no allowed ( blue and red ) points with @xmath26 below @xmath67 and the mass splittings do not allow the previous decay modes .",
    "having analyzed the modifications in the spectra due to the higher - dimension operators , we will devote the next section to study the collider phenomenology of these models .",
    "in this section we study the phenomenology of the bmssm higgs sector , including all of the effects and constraints described in section [ sec : review ] .",
    "we consider the low and large @xmath34 cases separately .",
    "we start with the low @xmath34 regime , fixing @xmath27 .",
    "as we have described in the previous section , the main modification introduced by the higher - dimension operators is to shift the higgs spectrum with respect to the mssm one .",
    "however , the couplings of the higgs bosons also get corrected .",
    "the combination of these two effects can give rise to sizable modifications in both the higgs production cross sections and the branching fractions .",
    "we compute the production cross sections in the following way .",
    "for the higgs - strahlung and vector boson fusion processes , we simply scale the corresponding sm cross section by the ( square of ) the higgs-@xmath79-@xmath79 coupling in our scenario , normalized to the sm coupling , i.e. by the effective coupling as defined in eq .",
    "( [ geff ] ) ( for all practical purposes this ratio coincides with the normalized higgs-@xmath4-@xmath4 coupling   and @xmath80 arises only from the custodially - violating higher - dimension operators , and was shown in @xcite to be numerically negligible . ] ) .",
    "for the gluon fusion cross section , we shall argue that the nlo k - factor in our scenario is expected to agree with the nlo k - factor in the sm within 20% .",
    "this implies that to this accuracy [ eq : ggheff ] & &  , since the ratio of cross sections equals the ratio of widths at leading order in @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ggheff ] ) is computed using our modified version of hdecay  @xcite , which includes the tree - level expressions for masses and couplings in the presence of the higher - dimension operators .",
    "the k - factor in our scenario differs from the sm one in two respects .",
    "first , the contribution to the gluon fusion cross section from bottom loops can not be neglected , specially in the large @xmath34 regime .",
    "second , one has to consider the presence of a relatively light susy spectrum .",
    "we discuss separately these two effects .",
    "to assess the impact of the bottom loop we use the code higlu  @xcite , that includes both the lo and nlo results for both the sm and the mssm  @xcite ( but , at present , does not include susy particles in the loop ) , to compute the k - factors in these two models .",
    "we find that at low @xmath6 and for a wide range of higgs masses , the nlo k - factors for @xmath25 , @xmath47 and @xmath82 coincide within 5% with the sm nlo k - factor for a higgs of the corresponding mass . at larger @xmath6 ( @xmath83 )",
    "the differences are larger , as expected , but still smaller than about 20% .",
    "we expect that the same will hold in our extended susy scenarios .",
    "the changes in the nlo k - factor due to relatively light sparticles in the loop , again in the mssm context , were studied in @xcite , where the effect was found to be less than @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that at low @xmath6 eq .",
    "( [ eq : ggheff ] ) holds to an accuracy of better than @xmath86 , and allows us to obtain a sufficiently precise estimate for the nlo gluon fusion cross section in our scenario . note that this uncertainty is below the one obtained by comparing the nlo and nnlo / nnll results in the sm calculation @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that the bulk of the effects of the light susy spectrum is taken into account in the lo cross section , and that these effects are fully implemented in hdecay , which is used to compute the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ggheff ] ) .",
    "this also includes radiative effects that correct the bottom yukawa coupling , which can be important at large @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "we discuss next a number of general features regarding the bmssm higgs signals . in both the sm and the mssm , the dominant decay channel for a higgs boson whose mass is greater than 140 gev is into w pairs .",
    "therefore , an important observable at a hadron collider is the production cross section times the branching fraction in the ww channel . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggtohtowwtb2 ] we show this quantity for @xmath25 and @xmath47 , normalized to the sm result , as a function of the corresponding higgs mass . in the left panel",
    "we clearly see the tevatron exclusion in the @xmath87 channel : the v - shaped magenta and red regions around @xmath88 correspond to the _ stripes _ that were already discussed in section  [ sec : spectra ] ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : mlvsma ] and [ fig : mhvsml ] ) .",
    "we stress that the blue points with @xmath33 above @xmath89 have a slightly enhanced @xmath38 signal compared to the sm . in turn",
    ", this mass range will be explored at the lhc via the @xmath90 channel ( recall that , for all practical purposes , the cp - even higgs normalized couplings to @xmath38 and @xmath91 are the same , hence the plot can be directly applied to the @xmath91 channel ) .",
    "thus , an enhanced signal in this region is an interesting feature : for these points , the higgs can not escape detection .",
    "for the blue points with @xmath38 signal reduced by a factor of 10 or more ( @xmath92 ) , one may have to rely on other search channels .",
    "note that this figure exhibits currently allowed ( blue and red ) points with @xmath40 below the lep bound of @xmath93 .",
    "these correspond to models where the coupling to gauge bosons is below the sm value .",
    "we also notice a group of red points whose signal is around the sm value , and with a mass slightly above the lep bound ( @xmath94 ) : these are within the tevatron reach in the @xmath65 channel , assuming an accumulated luminosity of @xmath29 per experiment and a 50% efficiency improvement in this channel .    turning our attention to the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ggtohtowwtb2 ] , we see that in the case of @xmath47 it is hard to differentiate regions where a single color is predominant , as was possible in the left panel",
    ". we can identify a mostly green region with @xmath95 above the lep bound ( and above the mssm curve ) .",
    "these points are excluded by the lep bound on @xmath40 rather than on @xmath95 , and serve as a reminder that the constraints may come from observables not related to those shown in a given plot .",
    "this is not to say that there are no points where the exclusion is through @xmath47 directly instead of @xmath25 : for instance , the magenta and red points in the upper left side of the plot correspond to the v - shape exclusion from @xmath51 at the tevatron .",
    "this is the only region where the signal is enhanced with respect to both the sm and the mssm .",
    "these correspond to models where @xmath47 is sm - like , while @xmath25 decays mainly into @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    aside from the @xmath38 channel",
    ", there are other important decay modes for light higgs bosons , in particular @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in the first case ,",
    "the huge qcd backgrounds render this channel very difficult to measure at a hadron collider .",
    "this does not mean , however , that this decay mode is completely useless .",
    "for instance , in the higgstrahlung process , @xmath99 , the gauge boson can be fully reconstructed from its decay modes , and then @xmath100 becomes a feasible option .",
    "another example to search for a sm - like higgs boson decaying into @xmath55 is the higgs associated production together with a top quark pair .",
    "this has the problem of being quite challenging at hadron colliders .",
    "the di - photon channel , on the other hand , constitutes the most promising decay channel for a relatively light sm - like higgs at the lhc since , in spite of its tiny br of @xmath101 , an excellent energy resolution can be achieved and the background is under good experimental control .",
    "the other important search channel at the lhc in the low higgs mass range is the vector boson fusion with the subsequent decay of the higgs into a @xmath102 pair .         in fig .",
    "[ fig : htobgamtb2 ] we show the branching fraction of @xmath25 into @xmath96 ( left plot ) and @xmath98 ( right plot ) , for @xmath103 . notice that the @xmath96 channel can be suppressed with respect to the sm one , as in the blue points with masses in the @xmath104 range and @xmath105 .",
    "this is an interesting feature , since it can lead to enhancements in other search channels .",
    "one can also see currently allowed ( blue and red ) points with brs into @xmath55 above the sm curve : those have a reduced br into w s , as we have previously identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggtohtowwtb2 ] . in the case of @xmath47 ( not shown here ) , the br into @xmath55 is typically higher than the sm value .",
    "with respect to the mssm , we find that there is no definite tendency : @xmath106 can be either increased or suppressed by an order of magnitude .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the branching fraction in the @xmath97 channel follows closely the @xmath96 behavior .",
    "this is as expected , since the extended higgs sectors under consideration do not distinguish between the down - type fermions , in the sense that the yukawa coupling normalized to the sm value is the same for bottoms and taus , while differences due to the susy qcd and top yukawa interactions , that arise at loop level , are not significant at small @xmath6 .",
    "turning our attention to the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : htobgamtb2 ] , we see that most models present a suppressed branching fraction in the di - photon channel . however , it is worth noticing the group of points above the sm curve , where an enhancement of up to a factor of 2 can be achieved .",
    "decays of the cp - even higgs bosons into pairs of @xmath82 bosons can become the dominant decay mode .",
    "such a scenario has been previously considered in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite for a model - independent analysis , and @xcite for nmssm studies ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : htoaa ] we show the branching fraction of @xmath25 and @xmath47 into @xmath56 , for @xmath103 .",
    "the left panel shows that the branching fraction in this channel can reach @xmath107 values , thus becoming the most relevant decay mode of @xmath25 .",
    "the tevatron allowed ( blue ) points in this figure present a reduced branching fraction in both the @xmath96 and the @xmath38 channel , and were already mentioned in the context of fig .  [",

    "the branching fractions vary considerably , but the @xmath56 channel may still become the primary decay mode in some models .",
    "the main modification to the decay phenomenology of @xmath82 and @xmath108 with respect to the mssm is due to the shift in the overall higgs spectrum .",
    "the channels that change the most are those that involve a higgs decaying into either a pair of higgs bosons , or a higgs boson plus a gauge boson . as an example of the latter , we take the decay of @xmath108 into a w boson and a neutral higgs . in the mssm , since @xmath25 tends to be rather light",
    ", one has that @xmath109 can be an important decay channel . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath26 and @xmath110 tend to be rather degenerate , one finds that @xmath111 is generally highly suppressed . on the contrary , in the context of the bmssm , one can find points where the mass hierarchy suffers an inversion , i.e. @xmath26 can be well below @xmath33 and split from @xmath76 . in this case , one finds that @xmath82 and @xmath25 interchange their roles with respect to the above described situation in the mssm , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ctb2 ] .",
    "the left panel shows points where the @xmath112 channel has a br greater than @xmath113 , while the right panel shows that the @xmath114 decay mode is highly suppressed . in this case , the process @xmath115 can give rise to an interesting signal at the lhc , possibly allowing the discovery of two nonstandard higgs bosons .",
    "note that we have already encountered another example of an inversion between @xmath82 and @xmath25 in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig : htoaa ] : the potentially open mssm channels @xmath116 and @xmath117 are replaced by @xmath118 and @xmath77 in the bmssm context .    finally , turning our attention to @xmath82 , we have found that the @xmath119 decay channel is significantly reduced with respect to the mssm value @xmath120 for values of @xmath26 below @xmath121 , due to the shift in @xmath33 that disfavors this decay mode .",
    "and @xmath82 also takes place , but the @xmath122 decay mode is typically suppressed by a factor of 10 or more with respect to the dominant decay mode @xmath118 , when kinematically allowed . ]",
    "this reduction brings an enhancement in both the @xmath96 and @xmath97 channels . as in the mssm ,",
    "the former is the dominant decay channel below the @xmath123 threshold , and the latter stays almost constant at about 10% .      up to this point",
    "we have analyzed each observable almost independently of the others .",
    "we would like to understand , however , how the different features that we have singled out are correlated with each other .",
    "we shall consider benchmark scenarios currently allowed by lep and tevatron data and explore two possibilities : a ) models that can be probed at 95 % c.l at the tevatron in the near future , from now on referred to as _ tevatron covered _",

    "it is interesting to ask whether a given model can be probed by more than one channel at the tevatron .",
    "we find , however , that the previous subsets are disjoint .",
    "the disjointness between the subsets probed by @xmath125 and @xmath126 can be understood in terms of the relevant mass ranges , since the @xmath96 search is most sensitive to the @xmath127 range , while the di - boson channel probes the region @xmath128 . in principle",
    ", they do not have to be mutually exclusive , but one would need an enhancement of 3.4 over the sm in the @xmath60 signal in order to probe a @xmath129 higgs in this channel , and @xmath125 channels . ] which is not achievable within these models : the increase in the @xmath130 cross section is always below a factor of @xmath131 . in the case of @xmath25 and @xmath47 decaying into w bosons , even if both of them are in the favorable mass region ( @xmath132 , the mssm sum rule @xmath133 is valid within 5 % accuracy , and it is not possible for @xmath25 and @xmath47 to have large enough couplings to w s for both signals to simultaneously be within the tevatron reach .",
    "the subsets probed by the @xmath125 and @xmath51 searches are disjoint because both processes require a sizable coupling of the higgs to @xmath79 s ( for production and decay , respectively ) , but this does not happen when @xmath40 and @xmath95 are sufficiently different , as would be required for simultaneous searches in these two channels .    _ point a : mssm - like scenarios _    * point a *    .",
    "_ masses and branching fractions in the bmssm ( and in the sm for @xmath25 ) for point a. we only show the main decay modes . the effective couplings @xmath134 were defined in eq .",
    "( [ geff ] ) . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we illustrate the features of models with a strong enhancement of the di - photon signal with point h   ( shown in table  [ tab : pointh ] ) .",
    "we see that @xmath25 is rather light ( the @xmath124 operators contribute about @xmath135 to @xmath40 ) , but escaped detection at lep due to the strong suppression of the @xmath55 channel .",
    "the @xmath136 signal is larger than the sm one by a factor of @xmath137 , thus allowing for a very nice and clean detection of @xmath25 at the lhc . as was discussed in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig : htoggtb20 ] , the same enhacement also occurs for the @xmath38 and @xmath91 channels .",
    "therefore , and in spite of such a light higgs mass , the @xmath138 channel would be at the reach of the lhc .    for the remaining neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath47 and @xmath82 ) , one will have to consider the @xmath97 search .",
    "the charged higgs may be detected at the lhc in the @xmath139 channel .",
    "note that the benchmark point h has nonstandard higgs bosons that are too light to allow decays into @xmath140",
    ". however , given that @xmath25 is rather light in the region with suppressed @xmath55 couplings , it is possible that such _ exotic _",
    "channels might be open , while still having an interesting di - photon signal . as mentioned before , in such cases",
    "it is possible that other channels involving susy particles are also open .",
    "we studied the higgs collider phenomenology of bmssm scenarios , i.e. supersymmetric extensions of the mssm within an eft framework where the effects of the bmssm degrees of freedom enter through higher - dimension operators .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite the first two orders in the @xmath0 expansion can be phenomenologically significant , and should be included .",
    "in the present work , we have performed a model - independent study to highlight the variety of collider signals that become available in such scenarios .",
    "the coupling of the lightest cp - even higgs to bottom pairs can be suppressed due to cancellations between the mssm contribution and those from the higher - dimension operators .",
    "it does not seem to require a special tuning of parameters and occurs in both the low and large @xmath6 regimes . as a result , the signals in clean channels , such as the di - photon or @xmath38 ones , can be greatly enhanced .",
    "this suppression in the @xmath141 induces an enhancement in the gluon fusion production cross section , beyond the one arising from light sparticles in the loop .    to emphasize the interplay between the tevatron and the lhc , we have analyzed projections for the tevatron assuming a total integrated luminosity of @xmath29 per experiment and a 50% efficiency improvement in the @xmath38 and @xmath55 search channels with respect to present results .",
    "we find that the current tevatron data already probes a large class of susy models , especially in the @xmath38 channel .",
    "the future projections indicate that the @xmath96 channel can become effective for a sm - like higgs search .",
    "moreover , a combination of the @xmath55 and @xmath38 search channels , together with the @xmath102 decay mode in the large @xmath34 region , would further enlarge the set of bmssm models that can be probed at the tevatron . however , our main interest in this work was to survey the types of signals that might be expected in susy scenarios , many of which are not realized in the mssm limit . improving the analysis by combining channels and/or moderately increasing",
    "the luminosity will not significantly change our conclusions .",
    "lightest cp - even higgs bosons with masses above @xmath89 , that can not be probed by the tevatron , will be at the reach of the lhc .",
    "most of the changes in the expected higgs signals , compared to the mssm , can be understood in large part from the altered higgs spectrum .",
    "we have surveyed a wide range of possibilities by scanning over the parameter space of the higher - dimension operators .",
    "motivated by naturalness arguments , we have chosen the susy - breaking scale close to the ew scale , with the bmssm physics at the @xmath142 scale . in this case",
    ", the contributions from the susy particles to the higgs spectrum are subleading compared to the ones coming from the bmssm physics . in the case of a heavier susy spectrum , and for a scale @xmath1 such that the effective field theory approach remains valid , the qualitative features of the higgs phenomenology triggered by the bmssm physics will be similar .",
    "however , a detailed study should be performed for each specific choice of the heavy scale @xmath1 , the scale of susy - breaking @xmath143 , and the @xmath144-term to address the quantitative features of the higgs sector .",
    "we have defined a number of `` benchmark points '' in order to discuss the correlations between different higgs signals .",
    "interestingly , we find that there can be significant mixing in the cp - even higgs sector , allowing non - negligible couplings of both cp - even higgs eigenstates to the ew gauge bosons .",
    "in addition , they can both be in the right mass range to decay predominantly into @xmath79 s or @xmath4 s , thus enabling a detailed and direct study of the physics of ewsb . for these benchmark points ,",
    "the @xmath124 effects add a few tens of gev to @xmath40 , and have a rather relevant impact on the collider phenomenology ( but we remind the reader that the @xmath124 operators can easily give a much larger contribution to @xmath40 ; see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we have found viable examples where the nonstandard cp - odd higgs can be produced in charged higgs decays .",
    "moreover , unusual decay chains such as @xmath118 or @xmath77 are also possible , without @xmath82 being ultralight . these channels are most interesting in the low @xmath6 region where the @xmath6-enhanced production of the nonstandard higgs bosons is not available .",
    "these higgs decay chains open the possibility of fully reconstructing the higgs content of a 2hdm in such supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "we also find scenarios where observing the higgs sector is more challenging , and would require dedicated studies that go beyond the scope of this work .    in conclusion , we find that higgs signals in supersymmetric scenarios can be markedly different from those in the mssm paradigm .",
    "if all third generation squarks turn out to be light ( @xmath145 ) , given the lep higgs mass bounds , this will imply a clear case for bmssm physics .",
    "the heavier degrees of freedom could be at the kinematic reach of the lhc , but depending on their nature the direct discovery might be elusive . in either case , supersymmetric higgs searches can provide evidence of physics beyond the mssm .",

    "<S> we study extensions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with new degrees of freedom that couple sizably to the mssm higgs sector and lie in the tev range . after integrating out the physics at the tev scale </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting higgs spectrum can significantly differ from typical supersymmetric scenarios , thereby providing a window beyond the mssm ( bmssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account current lep and tevatron constraints , we perform an in - depth analysis of the higgs collider phenomenology and explore distinctive characteristics of our scenario with respect to both the standard model and the mssm . </S>",
