    "similar trend of increasing quark - diquark separation is seen in the @xmath31 scenario .",
    "graphically , the evolution of the proton elastic scattering structure is illustrated on figure  [ figure:3 ] , where the best fit parameters are also indicated on the sub - plots , generated for the case of the @xmath42 scenario .",

    "nevertheless we compare the best fit values of the different energies , to try to get a qualitative insight assuming , that the missing element of the model will not modify drastically the best fit parameters at lhc energies .",
    "given that the @xmath31 and the @xmath64 bialas - bzdak models correspond to two different assumptions about the internal structure of the protons , it was a kind of surprize for us , that the measured total pp cross - section @xmath0 was phenomenologically related to the parameters of the bb model in a model - independent way , i.e. the following relation is approximately valid for both scenarios :    @xmath65    this approximation was found to be valid within a relative error of about 9 % at isr energies , while at the lhc energies it yields only an ball - park value , order of magnitude estimation ( @xmath66 ) .",
