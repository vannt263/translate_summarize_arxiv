    "cold atoms interacting with time - modulated optical lattices display a wide variety of quantum and classical dynamics . these include the observations of dynamical localization @xcite , chaos - assisted tunneling @xcite , the anderson metal - insulator transition in momentum space @xcite , dynamically controlled tunneling @xcite , matter wave engineering @xcite or the probing of gapped modes in degenerate quantum gases @xcite .    in this article we propose and demonstrate the use of time - dependent optical lattice for atom optics through the investigation of the scattering of a cold atom packet on an amplitude - modulated optical lattice @xcite . our technique provides a new tunable tool for velocity selection in confined geometries and a system for studying quantum transport with time - dependent potentials @xcite as initially studied in mesoscopic physics @xcite .    the bragg reflection of a propagating guided matter wave on a static optical lattice has been recently demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the bragg condition on the class of velocities that are reflected reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an integer , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the lattice spacing .",
    "this condition is valid in the perturbative limit i.e. for a small - depth optical lattice @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lattice energy scale .",
    "however @xmath6 is directly related to the periodicity of the lattice and therefore can not be easily tuned over a large range .",
    "in contrast , the interaction of a propagating matter wave with an amplitude - modulated optical lattice offers more flexibility and realizes , in particular , a tunable bragg reflector .",
    "our study explores the non perturbative regime for which the lattice depth is on the order of the lattice energy scale @xmath7 and the modulation depth is relatively large . in this range of parameters and for our typical interaction time , the stroboscopic phase space does not exhibit any chaos @xcite and the scattering can therefore be used to engineer the velocity distribution of the incoming packet of atoms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "[ experimentalsetup ] and [ experimentalresults ] , we present the experimental setup and review the main observations . in sec .  [ vanishingdepthmodel ] , we derive a simple model based on a modulated vanishing depth optical lattice .",
    "this approach is successfully compared with the experimental results . in secs .",
    "[ floquetblochframework ] and [ semiclassicalmodel ] we develop a semiclassical model that combines the local floquet - bloch framework and landau - zener transitions to get a deeper insight on the elementary processes at work in the matter wave scattering . in sec .",

    "our experimental setup has already been described in @xcite . in short ,",
    "a thermal cloud of typically @xmath8 rubidium-87 atoms at @xmath9 nk is obtained after @xmath10 of forced evaporation in a crossed dipole trap formed by two red - detuned ( 1070 nm ) laser beams : a horizontal guide and a dimple beam . during the evaporation",
    ", we use the spin - distillation technique to prepare atoms in @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we deliberately use a thermal cloud rather than a bec in order to probe the modulated lattice for a wide range of velocities in a single shot ( see below ) . by switching off the dimple beam , we release a packet of longitudinal velocity dispersion @xmath12 in the horizontal guide .",
    "atoms are subsequently accelerated by a @xmath13 ms inhomogeneous magnetic field pulse to a mean velocity @xmath14 .",

    "two kinds of density dips are observed in the transmitted part : ( i ) dips whose positions do not depend on the modulation frequency and that correspond to velocity classes fulfilling the bragg reflection on the _ static _ lattice @xcite , and ( ii ) dips whose positions depend on the frequency . as we shall discuss below , some dips of the latter category have their counterpart in the reflected packet and correspond to reflected class of velocity while others are due to slowing down or acceleration effects .    except for the zones very close to depletion lines in the transmitted part in fig .  [ fig_exptheo](b ) , each position downward the lattice can be mapped onto a well defined class of incident velocity @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant @xcite .",

    "we find a good agreement between simulations and experiment .",
    "however such an approach does not reveal the mechanisms responsible for the depletion lines .",

    "( [ smeq1 ] ) and ( [ smeq2 ] ) , we get @xmath51    as a first example , let us consider the green dotted depletion line ( see fig .",

    "the states of the incoming packet with positive velocity in the range of energy that corresponds to band 4 will thus be projected onto the states that corresponds to the branch @xmath55 .",

    "[ simu_f_v ] ) . to identify the role of the different types of anticrossings on the incident matter wave packet ,",
    "we have performed a 1d simulation that solves the corresponding time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "figure [ simu_f_v](b ) gives the reflection coefficient as a function of the incident energy @xmath84 and the modulation frequency @xmath30 .",
    "two types of reflection conditions can be clearly identified : ( i ) those due to bragg reflection onto the static lattice ( no dependence on @xmath30 ) and ( ii ) those that correspond to open gap anticrossings and whose positions depend on @xmath30 .",
    "the interpretation is clear : when the incident energy falls in an open gap anticrossing , no propagating state is available and the particle is reflected .",
    "the degenerate anticrossings do not induce reflection in the square - envelope case .",
    "however , as we discuss below , they play an important role in the dynamics of the experimentally relevant case in which the lattice has a slowly varying envelope .",
    "in this latter case , the situation turns out to be different since the system can follow adiabatically a quasi - energy band during its time evolution . to describe this propagation",
    ", we propose a semiclassical model that enables one to identify the elementary processes responsibles for the velocity changes of the particle and the position at which such processes occur .",
    "it contains two main ingredients .",
    "the first one consists in describing the particle motion on a given _ local _ floquet - bloch band through the combined evolution of the wavepacket position and of its mean pseudo momentum @xmath85 .",
    "the corresponding set of coupled equations reads @xmath86 the first equation defines the group velocity of the wave packets while the second results from the adiabatic following condition @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the second ingredient consists in taking into account the possibility for a particle to undergo a landau - zener transition when it passes an anticrossing . in our case , the approximation of a local two - level situation is valid and therefore the probability to change the band index is @xmath88 with @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the size of the gap @xcite .     and a velocity dispersion @xmath12 . ]    in practice , we evolve the particle according to eqs .",
    "( [ eqmvt ] ) and we evaluate the energy difference to lower or upper bands at each time step . when this quantity reaches a minimum ( i.e. at an avoided crossing position ) , we compute the corresponding landau - zener probability and transfer or not the particle to the next band according to this probability .    to validate this semiclassical trajectory method , we compare it with the full resolution of the corresponding 1d schrdinger equation . to perform this comparison , we have simulated the semiclassical trajectories of 1700 incoming velocities about the mean velocity of the packet in the following range @xmath91 . in this way",
    ", we sample 98 % of the initial distribution .",
    "furthermore , we perform 35 shots for each incoming velocity to improve the statistics of our monte carlo simulation .    for each velocity class @xmath35",
    ", we get the density from the final positions of the different shots weighted by the initial wavepacket velocity distibution density at @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ comparaison ] provides an example of such a comparison for @xmath92 .",
    "the key features are very well captured by the semiclassical simulation . in this plot , we can easily identify the depletion lines that correspond to the different interband transitions .",
    "we can use the semiclassical model to analyze the different mechanisms yielding to depletion bands as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_exptheo ] . for this purpose",
    ", we follow deterministically the branch for which the landau - zener transition probability is above 1/2 at an avoided crossing . to illustrate the wide variety of possibilities",
    ", we shall choose three generic and different set of parameters @xmath93 yielding to dips in the output density distribution ( see labels 1 , 2 and 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig_exptheo](c ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ stories](a ) , we plot the velocity along with the mean floquet excitation number for each case and for the main trajectory given by the monte - carlo simulation . in fig .",
    "[ stories](b ) we show the corresponding floquet - bloch diagrams in the region of interest . when a particle is moving toward the center , all quasi energies decrease since the amplitude of the attractive lattice increases . as a result",
    ", the particle state moves up relatively to the band diagram .",
    "in the same way , if the particle is moving backward , it will go down the hills of the diagram . with these simple pictures in mind trajectories can be readily interpreted . in each case , the key phenomenon is the absorption or stimulated emission of a floquet photon by adiabatic following denoted by @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ stories ] . in case",
    "( 1 ) , the particle emits a floquet photon , performs a reflection ( denoted @xmath95 ) when reaching the bottom of the band and absorbs a floquet photon ( @xmath96 ) before leaving the lattice . in case",
    "( 2 ) , the first emission only slows down the particle which is then bragg reflected and subsequently accelerated by floquet photon absorption . in case ( 3 ) , the particle is not reflected .",
    "it is transiently accelerated in the lattice by a floquet photon absorption - emission cycle . for a much longer propagation time",
    ", the dip would be refilled .",
    "other features of the experimental and numerical diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig_exptheo ] can be readily explained thanks to our semiclassical model .",
    "for instance , the density bump above the white dashed line corresponds to atoms that have been slowed down .",
    "the velocity spread of reflected particles at position 2 ( see fig .  [ fig_exptheo ] ) is 0.8 mm / s .",
    "this value can be recovered from the variation of the energy position of the gap along the lattice .    ) for a fixed frequency @xmath97 and a scanned frequency @xmath98 .",
    "a narrow slice of transmitted atoms is produced ( see arrow ) .",

    "inset : mean velocity of the slice of atoms as a function of @xmath98.,width=340 ]    for a given incident kinetic energy @xmath84 , a large size of the envelope and/or a large modulation depth increases the efficiency of the process since it favors an adiabatic following of the anticrossings .",
    "a less intuitive feature concerns the lattice depth .",
    "indeed , a small lattice depth ( @xmath99 ) increases the selectivity of the class of incident velocities that are affected by the modulation .",
    "this originates from the fact that the system is projected on a high energy band , and the position of the gap remains roughly constant throughout the lattice .",
    "interestingly enough , this ensures the robustness of the method against the specific shape of a smooth envelope .",
    "the narrowest velocity filters used in the cold atom community rely on velocity selective raman transitions on atoms in free space .",
    "this technique involves a combined change of internal and external states .",
    "the achievable velocity width are in the range of 200 - 300 @xmath100 m/s @xcite . using the scattering on amplitude modulated optical lattice we demonstrate hereafter a new technique to realize a velocity filter with a width slightly larger than the state of the art with velocity selective raman transitions .",
    "our technique uses only the external degrees of freedom and thus does not require any specific internal configuration .",
    "in addition it is well adapted for guided matter waves .",
    "we turn our device into a tunable momentum filter by combining different modulation frequencies .",
    "we use here the main reflection line ( white dashed line in fig .  [ fig_exptheo ] ) that acts as a notch filter in momentum space . for this purpose",
    ", we modulate the lattice with two different frequencies to create a transmitted band between two rejected ones : @xmath101 . strictly speaking",
    ", the detailed dynamics of a wave packet submitted to this two frequency and non perturbative modulation can not be inferred directly from the single frequency dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the simple picture according to which nearly independent dips can be drilled into the velocity distribution with two frequencies is quite robust .",
    "we observe that the reflection spectrum is roughly the product of the two independent spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ filtre ] ) @xcite",
    ". the mean velocity of the slice of atoms is therefore governed by @xmath102 while its width is controlled by the frequency difference @xmath103 . in our set of experiments , @xmath104 is fixed at @xmath105 and @xmath98 is varied from @xmath106 to @xmath107  khz . between the two reflection lines , atoms in a narrow class of velocity are transmitted ( arrow in fig .  [ filtre ] ) .",
    "the slice contains about 1000 atoms and has a mean velocity on the order of 15 mm / s ( inset of fig .",
    "[ filtre ] ) .",
    "the minimum velocity dispersion of the velocity filter that we have designed is on the order of 450 @xmath100 m/s for our parameters ( i.e. 1.1 nk in temperature units ) .",
    "the matter wave engineering presented here does not have any fundamental limit .",
    "a further improvement of velocity selection could be achieved using a smaller depth lattice combined with a larger waist size .",
    "this technique can be transposed easily to other species since it does not rely on a specific internal level configuration . by construction ,",
    "it is well adapted to 1d geometry and therefore enhances the toolbox of guided atom optics . finally , the control of the guided atomic flux for a given and tunable narrow class of velocities as studied here is reminiscent of the quantum modulated transistor principle where the gate voltage is replaced by the modulation @xcite .",
