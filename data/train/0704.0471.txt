    "the fundamental goal of nuclear physics is to understand the basic building blocks of nature - neutrons and protons - and the nature of interaction that binds them together into nuclear matter .",
    "studying the nature of matter and the strength of nuclear interaction is key to understanding some of the fundamental problems such as , how are elements formed ? how do stars explode into supernova ?",
    "what kind of matter exists inside a neutron star ?",
    "how are neutrons compressed inside a neutron star to density trillions of times greater than on earth ? what determines the density - pressure relation , the so - called equation of state ?",
    "the key ingredient for constructing the nuclear equation of state is the basic nucleon - nucleon interaction . until now",
    "our understanding of the nucleon - nucleon interaction has come from studying nuclear matter that is symmetric in isospin ( neutron - to - proton ratio , @xmath0 @xmath1 1 ) and matter found near normal nuclear density ( @xmath2 @xmath1 0.16 @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is not known how far this understanding remains valid as one goes away from the normal nuclear density and symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "various interactions used in  ab initio \" microscopic calculations predict different forms of the nuclear equation of state above and below the normal nuclear matter density , and away from the symmetric nuclear matter @xcite . as a result , the symmetry energy , which is the difference in energy between the pure neutron matter and the symmetric nuclear matter , shows very different behavior above and below normal nuclear density @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    in general , two different forms of the density dependence of the symmetry energy have been predicted .",
    "one , where the symmetry energy increases monotonically with increasing density (  stiff \" dependence ) and the other , where the symmetry energy increases initially up to normal nuclear density and then decreases at higher densities (  soft \" dependence ) .",
    "constraining the form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy is important not only for a better understanding of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , and hence its extrapolation to the structure of neutron - rich nuclei @xcite , but also for determining the structure of compact stellar objects such as neutron stars @xcite .",
    "for example , a  stiff \" form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy is predicted to lead to a large neutron skin thickness compared to a  soft \" dependence @xcite .",
    "similarly , a  stiff \" dependence of the symmetry energy can result in rapid cooling of a neutron star , and a larger neutron star radius , compared to a  soft \" density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) is therefore a fundamental entity that determines the properties of systems as diverse as atomic nuclei and neutron stars , and the knowledge of which is of significant importance @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the best possible means of studying the nuclear equation of state at sub - normal nuclear density is through intermediate - energy heavy - ion reactions @xcite . in this kind of reaction ,",
    "an excited nucleus ( the composite of the projectile and the target nucleus ) expands to a sub - nuclear density and disintegrates into various light and heavy fragments in a process called multifragmentation . by studying the isotopic yield distribution of these fragments one can extract important information about the symmetry energy and its density dependence .",
    "current studies on the nuclear equation of state are limited to beams consisting of stable nuclei .",
    "it is hoped that in the future radioactive beam facilities such as , fair ( gsi ) @xcite , spiral2 ( ganil ) and frib ( usa ) @xcite will provide tremendous opportunities for exploring the nuclear eos in regions never before studied ( _ i.e. _ , extreme isospin and away from normal nuclear density ) .    in this work ,",
    "we have made an attempt to study the density dependence of the symmetry energy using two different theoretical approaches for studying multifragmentation , namely the dynamical and the statistical model approaches of multifragmentation . in section ii , the isoscaling technique used to study the density dependence of the symmetry energy , and their different interpretations in terms of statistical and dynamical approach , are presented . in section iii and iv , a brief description of the experiment and the experimental results are presented .",
    "the dynamical and the statistical approaches used to interpret the experimental results are presented in section v. a comparsion between the two approaches with other independent studies is presented in section vi .",
    "finally , a discussion and summary , and conclusions are presented in section vii and viii , respectively .",
    "it has been shown from experimental measurements that the ratio of the fragment yields , r@xmath4(@xmath5,@xmath6 ) , taken from two different multifragmentation reactions , 1 and 2 , obeys an exponential dependence on the neutron number ( @xmath5 ) and the proton number ( @xmath6 ) of the fragments ; an observation known as isoscaling @xcite .",
    "the dependence is characterized by the relation ,    @xmath7    where , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fragment yields from the neutron - rich and the neutron - deficient systems , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is an overall normalization factor , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the parameters characterizing the isoscaling behavior .",
    "isoscaling is also theoretically predicted by the dynamical @xcite and statistical @xcite models of multifragmentation . in these models ,",
    "the difference in the chemical potential of systems with different neutron - to - proton ration ( @xmath0 ) is directly related to the isoscaling parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the isoscaling parameter @xmath11 , is related to the symmetry energy @xmath13 , through the relation ,    @xmath14    where , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the charge and the mass numbers from the two systems and @xmath19 is the temperature .",
    "this relation provides a simple and straight - forward connection between the symmetry energy and the fragment isotopic yield distribution .",
    "it must be mentioned that although the above equation derived from the statistical and the dynamical models of multifragmentation appears similar in form , the physical meaning of the terms involved in this equation differ for each model .",
    "\\1 ) in statistical models , the @xmath20 in eq . ( 2 ) corresponds to the charge - to - mass ratio of the initial equilibrated fragmenting system .",
    "whereas , in dynamical models , it corresponds to the charge - to - mass ratio of the liquid phase at a certain time ( @xmath1 300 _ fm / c _ ) during the dynamical evolution of the colliding systems .",
    "\\2 ) the interpretation of the symmetry energy @xmath13 , in dynamical and statistical models also differs significantly .",
    "the dynamical models relate the symmetry energy in the above equation to that of the fragmenting source .",
    "the statistical models , on the other hand , relate @xmath13 to that of the fragments formed at freeze - out .    these conceptual differences between the statistical and the dynamical models are due to the radically different approaches taken in the interpretation of the multifragmentation process .",
    "the different interpretation has also lead to conflicting results from the use of eq .",
    "2 , due to the different sequential decay effects predicted for the primary fragments by each model .",
    "the isoscaling parameter @xmath11 , in eq .",
    "2 corresponds to the hot primary fragments which undergo sequential decay into cold secondary fragments .",
    "these secondary fragments are the ones that are eventually detected in experiments .",
    "the experimentally determined isoscaling parameter must therefore be corrected for the sequential decay effect before comparing it to the theoretical models .",
    "it has been observed that while statistical model calculations show no significant change in the isoscaling parameter after sequential decay @xcite , dynamical models give contrasting results ; with some showing no significant changes @xcite , while others showing a change of as much as 50@xmath21 @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt both theoretical approaches with their respective interpretations to study the density dependence of the symmetry energy . in particular",
    ", we use the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) model @xcite and the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite for this study .",
    "a comparison between the two can provide useful insight into the physical meaning of the above equation in the two models .",
    "the experiments were carried out at the cyclotron institute of texas a@xmath22 m university ( tamu ) using the k500 superconducting cyclotron and the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) at michigan state university ( msu ) .",
    "targets of @xmath23fe ( 2.3 mg@xmath24@xmath25 ) and @xmath23ni ( 1.75 mg@xmath24@xmath25 ) were bombarded with beams of @xmath26ar and @xmath26ca at 33 and 45 mev@xmath24nucleon for the tamu measurements @xcite , and targets of @xmath23fe ( @xmath27 5 mg@xmath24@xmath25 ) and @xmath23ni ( @xmath27 5 mg@xmath24@xmath25 ) were bombarded with beams of @xmath26ar and @xmath26ca at 25 and 53 mev@xmath24nucleon for the nscl measurements @xcite .",
    "the various combinations of target and projectile nuclei allowed for a range of @xmath0 ( neutron - to - proton ratio ) ( 1.04 @xmath28 1.23 ) of the system to be studied , while keeping the total mass constant ( @xmath29 = 98 ) . in a separate experiment at tamu ,",
    "beams of @xmath23ni and @xmath23fe at 30 , 40 , and 47 mev / nucleon were also bombarded on self - supporting @xmath23ni and @xmath23fe targets .    the beams in the tamu measurements were fully stripped by allowing them to pass through a thin aluminum foil before being hit at the center of the target inside the tamu 4@xmath30 neutron ball @xcite .",
    "light charged particles ( @xmath6 @xmath31 2 ) and intermediate mass fragments ( @xmath6 @xmath32 2 ) were detected using six discrete telescopes placed inside the scattering chamber of the neutron ball at angles of 10@xmath33 , 44@xmath33 , 72@xmath33 , 100@xmath33 , 128@xmath33 and 148@xmath33 .",
    "each telescope consisted of a gas ionization chamber ( ic ) followed by a pair of silicon detectors ( si - si ) and a csi scintillator detector , providing three distinct detector pairs ( ic - si , si - si , and si - csi ) for fragment identification .",
    "the ionization chamber was of axial field design and was operated with cf@xmath34 gas at a pressure of 50 torr .",
    "the gaseous medium was 6 cm thick with a typical threshold of @xmath27 0.5 mev / nucleon for intermediate mass fragments .",
    "the silicon detectors had an active area of 5 cm @xmath35 5 cm and were each subdivided into four quadrants .",
    "the first and second silicon detectors in the stack were 0.14 mm and 1 mm thick , respectively .",
    "the dynamical energy range of the silicon pair was @xmath27 16 - 50 mev for @xmath36he and @xmath27 90 - 270 mev for @xmath37c .",
    "the csi scintillator crystals that followed the silicon detector pair were 2.54 cm in thickness and were read out by photodiodes .",
    "good elemental ( @xmath6 ) identification was achieved for fragments that punched through the ic detector and stopped in the first silicon detector .",
    "fragments measured in the si - si detector pair also had good isotopic separation .",
    "fragments that stopped in csi detectors showed isotopic resolution up to @xmath6 = 7 . the trigger for the data acquisition was generated by requiring a valid hit in one of the silicon detectors .",
    "the calibration of the ic - si detectors were carried out using the standard alpha sources and by operating the ic at various gas pressures .",
    "the si - si detectors were calibrated by measuring the energy deposited by the alpha particles in the thin silicon and the punch - through energies of different isotopes in the thick silicon .",
    "the si - csi detectors were calibrated by selecting points along the different light charged isotopes and determining the energy deposited in the csi crystal from the energy loss in the calibrated si detector .    the setup for the nscl experiment consisted of 13 silicon detector telescopes placed inside the msu 4@xmath30 array .",
    "four of which were placed at 14@xmath33 , each of which consisted of a 100 @xmath38 m thick and a 1 mm thick silicon surface - barrier detector followed by a 20 cm thick plastic scintillator .",
    "five telescopes were placed at 40@xmath33 , in front of the most forward detectors in the main ball of the 4@xmath30 array .",
    "they each consisted of a 100 @xmath38 m surface - barrier detector followed by a 5 mm lithium drifted silicon detector .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "good isotopic resolution was obtained as in tamu measurements .",
    "the event characterization of the nscl data was accomplished by detection of nearly all the coincident charged particles by the msu 4@xmath30 array .",
    "data were acquired using two different triggers ; the bulk of which was obtained with the requirement of a valid event in one of the silicon telescopes .",
    "additional data were taken with a minimum bias 4@xmath30 array trigger for normalization of the event characterization .",
    "the impact parameter of the event was determined by the mid - rapidity charge detected in the 4@xmath30 array as discussed in ref .",
    "the effectiveness of the centrality cuts was tested by comparing the multiplicity of events from a minimum bias trigger with the multiplicity distribution when a valid fragment was detected at 40@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the minimum bias trigger had a peak multiplicity of charged particles of one , whereas with the requirement of a fragment at 40@xmath33 , the peak of the multiplicity distribution increased to five .",
    "the event characterization for the tamu data was accomplished by using the 4@xmath30 neutron ball that surrounded the detector assembly .",
    "the neutron ball consisted of eleven scintillator tanks segmented in its median plane and surrounding the vacuum chamber .",
    "the upper and the lower tank were 1.5 m diameter hemispheres .",
    "nine wedge - shaped detectors were sandwiched between the hemispheres .",
    "all the wedges subtended 40@xmath33 in the horizontal plane .",
    "the neutron ball was filled with a pseudocumene - based liquid scintillator mixed with 0.3 @xmath21 ( b.w . ) of gd salt ( gd 2-ethyl hexanoate ) . scintillations from thermal neutrons captured by gd were detected by twenty 5-inch phototubes : five in each hemisphere , one on each of the identical 40@xmath33 wedges and two on the forward edges .",
    "the efficiency with which the neutrons could be detected is about 83@xmath21 , as measured with a @xmath39cf source .",
    "the detected neutrons were used to differentiate between the central and peripheral collisions . to understand the effectiveness of neutron multiplicity as a centrality trigger , simulations were carried out using a hybrid buu - gemini calculations at various impact parameters for the @xmath26ca + @xmath23fe reaction at 33 mev / nucleon .",
    "the simulated neutron multiplicity distribution was compared with the experimentally measured distribution . the multiplicity of neutron for the impact parameter _",
    "b _ = 0 collisions was found to be higher than the _ b _ = 5 collision . by gating on the 10@xmath21 highest neutron multiplicity events",
    ", one could clearly discriminate against the peripheral events .",
    "to determine the contributions from noncentral impact parameter collisions , neutrons emitted in coincidence with fragments at 44@xmath33 and 152@xmath33 were calculated at _",
    "b _ = 0 _ fm _ and _ b _ = 5 _ fm_. the number of events were adjusted for geometrical cross sectional differences . a ratio was made between the number of events with a neutron multiplicity of at least six , calculated at _",
    "b _ = 0 _ fm _ , and the number of events with the same neutron multiplicity at _ b _ = 5 _ fm_. the ratios were observed to be 19.0 and 11.1 at 44@xmath33 and 1.3 and 2.2 at 152@xmath33 for 33 and 45 mev / nucleon respectively . at intermediate angles , high neutron multiplicities",
    "were observed to be outside the region in which _ b _ = 5 _ fm _ contributes significantly . at backward angles the collisions at",
    "_ fm _ made a larger contribution to the neutron multiplicity .",
    "in addition to the neutron multiplicity distribution , the charge distribution of the fragments was also used to investigate the contributions from central and mid - impact parameter collisions .",
    "the _ b _ = 5 collisions produced essentially no fragments with charge greater than three in the 44@xmath33 telescope .    in an earlier work @xcite",
    ", some analysis of the fragment kinetic energy and charge distributions were presented .",
    "it was shown that at a laboratory angle of 44@xmath33 the kinetic energy and the charge distributions are well reproduced by the statistical model calculation .",
    "using a moving source analysis of the fragment energy spectra , it was also shown that the fragments emitted at backward angles originate from a target - like source , while those emitted at 44@xmath33 originate primarily from a composite source . in this work",
    ", we will concentrate exclusively on data from the laboratory angle of 44@xmath33 , which corresponds to the center of mass angle @xmath1 90@xmath33 , to study the symmetry energy and the isoscaling properties of the fragments produced .",
    "the choice of this angle enables one to select events which are predominantly central and undergo bulk multifragmentation .",
    "the contributions to the intermediate mass fragments from the projectile - like and target - like sources can therefore be assumed to be minimal .",
    "the experimentally measured relative isotopic yield distributions for the lithium ( left ) and carbon ( right ) elements , in @xmath23ni + @xmath23ni ( star symbols ) , @xmath23ni + @xmath23fe ( square symbols ) , @xmath23fe + @xmath23ni ( circle symbols ) and @xmath23fe + @xmath23fe ( triangle symbols ) reactions , are shown in fig . 2 for beam energies of 30 , 40 and 47 mev / nucleon .",

    "the isotope distribution for each element in fig .",
    "3 shows higher fragment yield for the neutron rich isotopes in @xmath26ar + @xmath23fe reaction ( squares ) , which has the largest neutron - to - proton ratio ( @xmath0 ) , in comparison to the @xmath26ca + @xmath23ni reaction ( stars ) , which has the smallest neutron - to - proton ratio . the yields for the reaction , @xmath26ar + @xmath23fe ( circles ) , which has an intermediate value of the neutron - to - proton ratio , are in between those of the other two reactions .",
    "a similar feature is also observed for the @xmath23ni + @xmath23fe , @xmath23fe + @xmath23ni and @xmath23fe + @xmath23fe reactions shown in fig .",
    "the fragment yield distributions therefore show the isospin dependence of the composite system on the fragments produced in the multifragmentation reaction .",
    "one also observes that the relative difference in the yield distribution between the three reactions in each figure decreases with increasing beam energy .",
    "this is due to the secondary de - excitation of the primary fragments , a process that becomes important for systems with increasing neutron - to - proton ratio and excitation energy .      as discussed in section",

    "one also observes that the alignment of the data points varies with beam energies as well as the pairs of reaction . to have a quantitative estimate of this variation , the ratio for each element ( @xmath6 )",
    "was simultaneously fit using an exponential relation ( shown by the solid lines ) to obtain the slope parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the values of the parameters are shown at the top of each panel in the figure .",
    "the value of the slope parameter @xmath11 is larger for the @xmath26ar + @xmath23fe and @xmath26ca + @xmath23ni reactions , which has a larger difference in the @xmath0 of the systems in the pair , compared to the @xmath26ar + @xmath23ni and @xmath26ca + @xmath23ni reactions , which has a smaller difference in the corresponding @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath11 value furthermore decreases with increasing beam energy .",
    "a similar feature is also observed in fe + fe , fe + ni , ni + fe and ni + ni systems .",

    "a relative comparison of how the isoscaling parameter @xmath11 , evolves as a function of beam energy and the isospin of the system is shown in fig .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the @xmath11 value decreases with beam energy from 25 mev@xmath24nucleon to 53 mev@xmath24nucleon .",
    "in addition , there is also a clear drop in the @xmath11 values with the decrease of the @xmath0 values of the system .",
    "the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite is a microscopic model that simulates the time evolution of a nuclear collision .",

    "<S> it is observed that the dynamical and the statistical model calculations give consistent results assuming the sequential decay effect in dynamical model to be small . a comparison with several other independent studies is also made to obtain important constraint on the form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy </S>",
