    "it is revealed that the chemical potential difference between neutrons and protons , which is an important index of symmetry energy ( as in isoscaling ) , is also found to vary little in the central collisions and supports the assumption that the symmetry energy is identical in similar sources @xcite .",

    "<S> the residue coulomb interaction ( rci ) , which affects the results of symmetry energy of neutron - rich nucleus in isobaric yield ratio ( iyr ) methods , is difficult to be determined . </S>",
    "<S> four rci approximations are investigated : ( 1 ) the m1rci adopting the @xmath0 ( the ratio of coulomb energy coefficient to temperature ) determined from the iyr of mirror - nuclei fragment ; ( 2 ) the m2rci by fitting the difference between iyrs ; ( 3 ) the m3rci by adopting the standard coulomb energy at a temperature @xmath1mev ; and ( 4 ) neglecting the rci among the three isobars . </S>",
    "<S> the m1 , m2 and m3rci is found to no larger than 0.4 . in particular , the m2rci is very close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of rci in the @xmath2 of fragment are also studied . </S>",
    "<S> the m1 and m4@xmath2 are found to be the lower and upper limitations of @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the m2@xmath2 overlaps the m4@xmath2 , which indicates that the m2rci is negligible , at the same time the rci among the three isobars can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> a relative consistent low values of m3@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are found in very neutron - rich isobars . </S>"
