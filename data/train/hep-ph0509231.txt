    "recent cosmological observations , especially after the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite @xcite , have established the @xmath2cdm cosmological model with a great accuracy .",
    "the abundance of cold dark matter is also precisely measured as ( in 2 @xmath3 range ) @xmath4 however , to clarify the identity of a particle as cold dark matter is still an open problem in cosmology and particle physics .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supersymmetric models is suitable for cold dark matter , because it is stable owing to the conservation of r parity . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is typically the lsp and the promising candidate for cold dark matter .",
    "neutralinos consist of a mixture of neutral gauginos and higgsinos , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath7 gaugino ( b - ino ) , @xmath8 is the @xmath9 gaugino ( w - ino ) , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two neutral higgsinos .",
    "the components of the neutralinos @xmath12 , in other words the coefficients @xmath13 , are model dependent .",
    "for example , in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) , the lightest neutralino is b - ino - like @xmath14 in most of the parameter region .",
    "the exception is the so - called `` focus point '' region where the lightest neutralino is higgsino - like . in the light of the wmap data , the parameter space in the cmssm which allows the neutralino relic density suitable for cold dark matter has been reanalyzed and the allowed region is dramatically reduced due to the great accuracy of the wmap data @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that the predicted relic density of the b - ino - like neutralino is generally too much to meet the observational result because its annihilation cross section is too small .",
    "however , in another model , the lightest neutralino can be w - ino - like or higgsino - like .",
    "for example , the w - ino - like lightest neutralino @xmath15 is naturally realized in the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) scenario @xcite .",
    "the annihilation cross section of the w - ino - like neutralino is larger than that of the b - ino - like neutralino , since its pair annihilation process into two w bosons and coannihilation process with charginos via w boson exchange are governed by the @xmath9 gauge coupling .",
    "the predicted relic density of the w - ino - like neutralino is roughly estimated as @xcite @xmath16 hence , the w - ino mass @xmath17 around @xmath18 tev is necessary to be consistent with the wmap data , and the w - ino - like neutralino seems not to be an appealing candidate in the viewpoint of the weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "there are some possibilities to make the w - ino - like neutralino with mass of @xmath19 gev a reasonable dark matter candidate , such as nonthermal production of the w - ino - like neutralino @xcite or the introduction of additional energy component at the neutralino decoupling time @xcite .    here",
    ", we remind the reader that the thermal relic density of dark matter depends on the underlying cosmological model as well as its annihilation cross section .",
    "if a non - standard cosmology has been realized at the neutralino decoupling time , the resultant relic density of the dark matter can be altered from the one in standard cosmology . a brane world cosmological model that is being intensively investigated @xcite is an interesting example which provide an unconventional cosmological expansion in the early universe . in the cosmology based on the so - called `` rs ii '' model , first proposed by randall and sundrum @xcite , the friedmann equation for a spatially flat spacetime",
    "is found to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 is the hubble parameter , @xmath23 is the energy density of matter , @xmath24 is the newton s gravitational constant with @xmath0 being the five - dimensional planck mass , and the four - dimensional cosmological constant has been tuned to be almost zero .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is constrained by big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , which is roughly given by @xmath26 mev ( or equivalently @xmath27 tev ) @xcite .",
    "this is a model - independent cosmological constraint . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in the original paper by randall and sundrum @xcite , the precision measurements of the gravitational law in the submillimeter range lead to more stringent constraint @xmath28 tev ( or equivalently @xmath29 gev ) through the vanishing cosmological constant condition .",
    "however note that this constraint , in general , is quite model dependent .",
    "in fact , if we consider an extension of the model so as to introduce a bulk scalar field , the constraint can be moderated because of the change of the vanishing cosmological constant condition @xcite .",
    "hence , we care about only the bbn constraint on @xmath25 in this paper .    the @xmath30 term in eq .",
    "( [ branefriedmanneq ] ) is a new ingredient in brane world cosmology and it dominates over the linear term at a high temperature regime .",
    "this modification of the expansion law can lead some drastic changes for some results previously obtained in standard cosmology @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been pointed out that the thermal relic abundance of dark matter can be considerably enhanced compared to that in standard cosmology @xcite . when this scenario is applied to the analysis of the neutralino dark matter in the cmssm ,",
    "the allowed parameter region is dramatically modified and eventually disappears as the five - dimensional planck mass ( @xmath0 ) becomes small , and thus the lower bound on @xmath0 can be obtained @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , note that this enhancement implies that a light w - ino dark matter would be favored in brane world cosmology because its annihilation processes are so efficient that its relic density is found to be too small in standard cosmology .    in this paper , we investigate the possibility that w - ino - like neutralino is a suitable candidate for cold dark matter with the help of the brane world cosmological effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief review of ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results for the w - ino - like neutralino relic density in brane world cosmology , which shows that the cosmologically interesting parameter region for the w - ino - like neutralino actually appears . sec .",
    "iv is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review on the relic density of dark matter in brane world cosmology with a low five - dimensional planck mass @xmath0 @xcite and roughly estimate the suitable scale of @xmath0 for w - ino dark matter .    in the context of brane world cosmology",
    ", we estimate the thermal relic density of a dark matter particle by solving the boltzmann equation @xmath31 with the modified friedmann equation eq .",
    "( [ branefriedmanneq ] ) , where @xmath32 is the actual number density of the dark matter particles , @xmath33 is the equilibrium number density , @xmath34 is the thermal averaged product of the annihilation cross section @xmath3 and the relative velocity @xmath35 .",
    "it is useful to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ n;boltzmann ] ) into the form , @xmath36 in terms of the number density to entropy ratio @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the mass of a dark matter particle , @xmath40 , @xmath41gev is the planck mass and @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 at the era @xmath44 the @xmath30 term dominates in eq .",
    "( [ branefriedmanneq ] ) , while the @xmath30 term becomes negligible after @xmath45 and the expansion law in standard cosmology is realized .",
    "hereafter we call the temperature defined as @xmath46 ( or @xmath42 itself ) `` transition temperature '' at which the expansion law of the early universe changes from the nonstandard one to the standard one . since we are interested in the effect of the @xmath30 term for the dark matter relic density , we consider the case that the decoupling temperature of dark matter ( @xmath47 ) is higher than the transition temperature , namely @xmath48 .",
    "although it is easy to numerically solve the boltzmann equation eq .",
    "( [ y;boltzmann ] ) given @xmath49 and @xmath42 as will be shown in the next section , here we derive analytic formulas for the relic number density of dark matter by adopting appropriate approximations .",
    "when we parameterize @xmath49 as @xmath50 with fixed @xmath51 , for simplicity , we can obtain simple formulas for the resultant relic densities such that @xmath52 in the limit @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the decoupling temperature @xcite .",
    "note that the results are characterized by the transition temperature rather than the decoupling temperature .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results to that in standard cosmology . using the well - known approximate formulas in the standard cosmology @xcite , @xmath55 we obtain the ratio of the relic energy density of dark matter in brane world cosmology ( @xmath56 ) to the one in standard cosmology ( @xmath57 ) such that @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the decoupling temperature in standard cosmology .",
    "thus , the relic energy density in brane world cosmology can be enhanced from the one in standard cosmology if the transition temperature is low enough .    together with eqs .",
    "( [ omegacdm ] ) , ( [ omegawino ] ) and ( [ omegaratio ] ) , we find @xmath60 therefore , the enhancement by the modified expansion law can make the w - ino - like neutralino with mass @xmath61(100 gev ) a suitable dark matter candidate for @xmath62 ; in other words , @xmath63 which corresponds to @xmath64 from eq .",
    "( [ def : xt ] ) .",
    "thus , in brane world cosmology with @xmath0 as low as 100 tev , the w - ino - like neutralino can be a suitable candidate for the cold dark matter even if its mass scale is of order 100 gev .",
    "on the other hand , too small @xmath0 causes the overproduction of dark matter in the universe , and the lower bound on @xmath0 can be obtained for a fixed @xmath65(100 ) gev .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our numerical analysis .",
    "we calculate the relic density of the w - ino - like neutralino @xmath66 based on the mass spectrum predicted in amsb scenario to realize the w - ino - like lightest neutralino , with the new friedmann equation eq .",
    "( [ branefriedmanneq ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we have modified the code darksusy @xcite so that the new friedmann equation is implemented . in evaluating the relic density ,",
    "the relevant coannihilations are taken into account .",
    "in addition , the spin - independent cross section for the direct detection is also estimated .",
    "the mass spectra in the amsb scenario are determined by the following input parameters @xcite , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the gravitino mass , @xmath69 is the universal scalar mass ( which is necessary to avoid tachyonic slepton mass problem ) , @xmath70 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral higgs fields , and @xmath71 is the sign of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath72 . with these input parameters , renormalization group equations for the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters",
    "are solved using the code suspect @xcite to obtain the mass spectra at the weak scale .    in the amsb scenario ,",

    "the relic density primarily depends on @xmath68 , and is insensitive to @xmath69 as expected from eq .",
    "( [ omegawino ] ) .",
    "the region along the bold line and the two coordinate axes is excluded by various experimental constraints ( the lightest higgs mass bound , @xmath84 constraint , the lighter chargino mass bound , etc . ) or the condition for the successful electroweak symmetry breaking . in particular , the region @xmath85",
    "is excluded where the lighter stau is the lsp , while the region @xmath68 @xmath86 20 tev is excluded by the current lower bounds on chargino and higgs masses .    the corresponding result for @xmath0 @xmath80 500 tev",

    "these figures clearly indicate that , as @xmath0 decreases to @xmath19 tev , the allowed region moves to the left and the mass of the w - ino - like neutralino becomes small .",

    "figures 4 - 6 contains the similar results for @xmath87 .",
    "it is seen that the contours of the relic density for @xmath87 is quite similar to that for @xmath76 .",
    "distortions around @xmath88 gev in fig . 5 and @xmath89 gev in fig .",
    "6 are due to the resonance effect by the cp - odd higgs boson with mass @xmath90 .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , the allowed region moves to the left and disappears eventually as in the case of @xmath76 . for @xmath87 , @xmath84 constraint is severer than @xmath76 case , and it nearly excludes the region @xmath91 @xmath86 1 tev and @xmath68 @xmath86 100 tev .    for @xmath92 tev , we can find the allowed region for w - ino dark matter in the parameter space , while for @xmath93 tev no allowed region appears .",
    "this value of @xmath0 agrees with the result of rough estimation in the previous section , and the expectation is confirmed .",
