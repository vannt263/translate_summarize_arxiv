    "a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) marks the brilliant finale to the short life of a massive star .",
    "the role of sne in the shaping of the universe can not be understated , especially when one considers their enormous input of ionizing photons , energy and chemical species into the universe .",
    "it is expected that all stars greater than about 8 @xmath1 will undergo a core - collapse at the end of their life ( see smartt 2009 for a review ) .",
    "many factors determine whether a sn may occur at all , and when it does , the exact type of supernova that will be produced , including : initial mass , chemical composition , rotation , magnetic fields , and whether the exploding star exists alone or is in a binary system .",
    "observationally there are two types of sne , which are divided by the presence ( type ii ) or lack of hydrogen ( type i ) in their peak spectra ( see filippenko 1997 for a review ) .",
    "type ii sne are further classified by the shape of the light curve ( lc ) : most type ii sne possess a plateau in their lcs ( iip ) , while others demonstrate a linear decay after peak brightness ( iil ) .",
    "type i core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are further grouped according to the lack of additional chemical species in their spectra : ib sne possess helium features which are absent in the spectra of ic .    amidst this zoo of sne ,",
    "ic - bl sne are a unique subtype of ic sne that have been made famous by their association with long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) .",
    "ic - bl sne possess broad lines ( bl ) in their spectra , which indicate ejecta moving at very large velocities ( in some cases more than 0.1@xmath2 ) . indeed , since the first association of a grb / xrf with a ic - bl sne was made in 1998 , where sn 1998bw was seen to occur temporally and spatially coincident with grb 980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) , all of the sne associated with grbs and xrfs have been ic - bl",
    ". however , there are many ic - bl sne that are not associated with a grb or xrf .",
    "these grb / xrf - less ic - bl sne are seen to have ejecta moving at comparable velocities ( e.g. ic - bl sn 2009bb , soderberg et al .",
    "2010 ; pignata et al .",
    "2011 ) , and are almost as energetic as grb / xrf sne , but have no corresponding gamma - ray emission .",
    "grb / xrf sne are rare events .",
    "several surveys , such as the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; smith et al .",
    "2011 ) , reveal that type ii sne are the most abundant ( @xmath3 ) , while ibc sne , including all subtypes ( e.g. ic - bl and grb / xrf sne ) , account for only one in every four core - collapse sne . furthermore , ic - bl sne are likely only 5% of the total ccsne population , and grb / xrf sne likely @xmath4 times less abundant than ibc sne ( e.g. podsiadlowski et al . 2004 ) .",
    "thus a major goal in grb / xrf - sn research is elucidating the unique and rare differences in the physical conditions and properties of the progenitor stars of grbs and xrfs relative to those of other ibc sne .",
    "several clues have already been revealed .",
    "the host environments of grbs and xrfs have a lower metal content than those of ib , ic and ic - bl sne ( modjaz et al .",
    "2008 ; modjaz et al . 2011 ; graham & fruchter 2012 ) , with ic sne arising from more metal - rich environments than ib and ic - bl sne ( modjaz et al . 2011 ) .",
    "it is known that massive stars with higher metalicities will lose more mass via line - driven winds than massive stars with lower metalicities ( e.g. puls et al .",
    "1996 ; kudritzki et al .",
    "2000 ; mokeim et al .",
    "2007 ) , thus providing a natural explanation to why the progenitor stars of ic sne are more stripped of their outer envelopes than ib sne .",
    "indeed mass loss seems to play a major role in deciding whether a star will ultimately produce a grb . according to the `` collapsar '' model ( see section [ sec : grb_vs_xrf ] )",
    ", an energetic jet can not pierce through a star that possess an extended envelope ( i.e. a supergiant ) , therefore the stellar progenitor needs to have a large amount of material removed for the jet to escape into space .",
    "such progenitors are expected to be wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars : highly evolved , stars whose outer envelopes of hydrogen and helium have been stripped away .    but herein exists a paradox  for while mass loss in massive stars comes via stellar winds , and the rate of which is highly dependent on metallicity , it is observed that grbs and xrfs arise from metal - poor stellar progenitors .",
    "so while the progenitors of grbs and xrfs would undergo less mass loss before exploding , and therefore providing a way to retain the necessary angular momentum to then power a grb , a mechanism is still needed to strip away the outer layers of the star .",
    "two solutions have been proposed .",
    "the first are the quasi - chemically homogeneous stellar models of @xcite and @xcite , which involve rapidly rotating single stars .",
    "a consequence of the rapid rotation is that the stellar interior undergoes extensive mixing , meaning that the outer hydrogen envelope is almost entirely burned into helium .",
    "this also has the effect that the stars do not undergo a giant phase in their evolution .",
    "while some mass loss occurs in these models via stellar winds , it does so from a much more compact surface , thus allowing the stars to preserve enough angular momentum to then produce a grb .",
    "what s more , quasi - chemically homogeneous stars appear to exist in nature . the flames survey ( hunter et al .",
    "2008 ) observed over 100 o- and b - type stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the milky way galaxy , and showed the presence of a group of rapidly rotating stars that were enriched with nitrogen at their surfaces .",
    "the presence of nitrogen at the surface could only be due to rotationally triggered internal transport processes that brought nuclear processed material , in this case nitrogen , from the core to the stellar surface .",
    "other observations of metal - poor o - type stars in the lmc by @xcite and @xcite also show the signature of cno cycle - processed material at their surfaces .",
    "the second solution is if the stellar progenitors of grbs and xrfs exist in binary systems .",
    "binary interaction offers a natural way for a star to be stripped of its outer envelope , most likely via roche - lobe overflow , while the merger of the stars , possibly through a common - envelope phase ( e.g. chevalier 2012 ) can provide the means to generate the necessary angular momentum to power a grb ( fryer & woosley 1998 ; zhang & fryer 2001 ; fryer & heger 2005 ) .",
    "there is a growing list of observations that show that most massive stars exist in binaries , including @xcite who have estimated that over 70% of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion star , which in a third of all cases will lead to a merger of the binary system .",
    "additional support for the notion that the progenitors of ibc sne are massive stars in binary systems has come from @xcite , who have argued that for a standard initial mass function , the observed abundances of the different types of ccsne are not consistent with expectations of single - star evolution .",
    "moreover , @xcite derived a 15% probability that all ibc sn arise from single - star wolf - rayet progenitors ( i.e. a star that is highly stripped of its outer layers of hydrogen and helium ) .    to date , a major breakthrough in understanding the type of stars of ccsne has arisen via direct imaging of the progenitor stars of type ii sne ( see smartt 2009 for a review ) .",
    "however no such discoveries have been made regarding the progenitor stars of ibc sne ( e.g. eldridge et al .",
    "instead other means of ascertaining the properties of the progenitor stars has arisen mostly via modelling of spectroscopy and photometry of the sne themselves ( e.g. iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ; mazzali et al . 2002",
    "; valenti et al . 2008 ) . while detailed modelling has revealed important clues to the properties of the stars that can give rise to certain ibc sne , the types of modelling vary from one event to another ( spectroscopic vs. photometric ) .",
    "therefore comparing the results of these modelling is not always consistent from case to case .    here",
    "i attempt to address this fact by performing a systematic analysis of published lcs of 61 ibc sne , including 20 grb / xrf sne and 9 ic - bl sne .",
    "all of the available @xmath0 photometry for these sne have been gathered from the literature , and their stretch and luminosity factors in each filter relative to a k - corrected template supernova ( sn 1998bw ) was determined .",
    "the average stretch and luminosity factors in all the available filters for each sn have been calculated , which were then used to transform the bolometric light curve ( lc ) of sn 1998bw .",
    "the resultant bolometric lcs were then fit using an analytical model based on @xcite to determine the nickel mass , explosion energy and ejecta mass of each sn .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec : arnett ] the arnett model is discussed in detail , while in section [ sec : method ] a detailed description of the method is given .",
    "in section [ sec : grbcase_study ] the validity of the method is demonstrated using the photospheric velocities obtained in section [ sec : photovel ] , while in section [ sec : stats_analysis ] the in - depth statistical analysis of the derived bolometric properties is presented .",
    "a discussion of the implications of the results in given in section [ sec : discussion ] , the caveats of the method are discussed in section [ sec : caveats ] , and the conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the tables of photometry , photospheric velocities , stretch & luminosity factors and bolometric properties of the entire sample of ibc sne can be found in the appendix .    throughout the paper observer - frame times",
    "are used unless specified otherwise in the text .",
    "foreground reddening has been corrected for using the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "a flat @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is used .",
    "@xcite derived an analytical model for type i sne - that is , sne whose lcs are powered purely by the decay of radioactive elements .",
    "this model has been used extensively since its initial formulation , as well as being built upon in recent years ( e.g. @xcite extended the original model to include not only the energy produced by the decay of nickel into cobalt , but also the energy produced by the decay of cobalt into iron ) .",
    "interested readers are encouraged to study these papers to appreciate the more subtle intricacies of its theoretical derivation , and here the main facets of the model are given .    at the heart of the the arnett model",
    "are the following assumptions :    1 .   a homologous expansion of the ejecta , 2 .",
    "spherical symmetry , 3 .",
    "the radioactive nickel present in the ejecta is located at the centre of the explosion and does not mix , 4 .",
    "radiation - pressure dominance , 5 .   a small initial radius before explosion ( @xmath10 ) , 6 .   the applicability of the diffusion approximation for photons ( i.e. the _ photospheric phase _ ) .",
    "the luminosity of a type i sne as a function of time is :    @xmath11    where    @xmath12    and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the energy release in one second by one gram of @xmath16ni and @xmath16co are , respectively , @xmath17 erg s@xmath7 g@xmath7 and @xmath18 erg s@xmath7 g@xmath7 ( sutherland & wheeler 1984 ; cappellaro et al .",
    "the decay times of @xmath16ni and @xmath16co , respectively , are @xmath19 days ( taubenberger et al . 2006 and references therein ) and @xmath20 days ( martin 1987 ) .",
    "@xmath21 is the effective diffusion time and determines the overall width of the bolometric light curve .",
    "@xmath21 is expressed in relation to the opacity @xmath22 and the ejecta mass @xmath23 , as well as the photospheric velocity @xmath24 at the time of bolometric maximum :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is a constant of integration ( arnett 1982 ) , and @xmath2 is the speed of light .",
    "additionally , we assume a constant opacity @xmath27 @xmath28g@xmath7 ( e.g. chugai 2000 ) , which is justified if electron scattering is the dominant opacity source ( e.g. chevalier 1992 ) . and",
    "finally , the kinetic energy of the ejecta is simply @xmath29 .",
    "the aim of this work is to obtain the bolometric properties of all of the sne in our sample .",
    "however , it is not possible to do this directly because of the lack of multi - wavelength observations for most of the events . to compensate for this lack of data",
    "i have used a template supernova , sn 1998bw , for which there is a wealth of multi - wavelength observations .",
    "this method therefore depends on the assumption that sn 1998bw is a good proxy for the sne in our sample .",
    "a detailed discussion of the caveats of this assumption is presented in section [ sec : caveats ] .",
    "the basic premise is then simple : to first determine the stretch ( @xmath30 ) and luminosity ( @xmath31 ) factors of the individual sne relative to the k - corrected lcs of sn 1998bw in every available @xmath0 filter , and then computed the average @xmath30 and @xmath31 for each sn .",
    "a simple empirical equation is then fit to the bolometric lc of sn 1998bw ( equation [ equ : stretch ] ) , and then the empirical relation is transformed by the average stretch and luminosity factors of each event using equation [ equ : stretch2 ] .",
    "the transformed lc is then fit with the arnett model , and using a value for the photospheric velocity ( see section [ sec : photovel ] ) , the bolometric properties of every sn in the sample are obtained .",
    "overall , our general method can be broken into two stages , first :    1 .",
    "obtain lcs for each event ; transform magnitudes into fluxes ( using flux zeropoints in fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) ; correct for foreground and rest - frame extinction ; remove host contribution where necessary .",
    "2 .   create a synthetic template light curve of sn 1998bw in each filter of how it would appear at the redshift of the sn being analysed .",
    "3 .   fit the template lc with an empirical relation ( equation [ equ : stretch ] ) .",
    "4 .   determine the relative stretch and luminosity factors in each filter to the fitted template ( using equation [ equ : stretch2 ] ) .",
    "calculate the average stretch and luminosity factors for each sn .",
    "once the stretch and luminosity factors have been determined in the individual filters , the following procedure was implemented to determine the bolometric properties of each sn :    1 .",
    "fit an empirical equation ( equation [ equ : stretch ] ) to the @xmath32 bolometric lc of 1998bw ( this needed to be done only once ) .",
    "2 .   apply the average stretch and luminosity factors to the empirical equation of 1998bw ( using equation [ equ : stretch2 ] ) .",
    "3 .   using the arnett model ,",
    "determine the nickel mass , ejecta mass and kinetic energy of the sn .",
    "the last step can only be completed if the photospheric velocity of the sn ejecta is known . for many events",
    "this is unknown , and so an _ average _ velocity is used instead ( see section [ sec : photovel ] ) .",
    "our empirical relation is ( cano et al .",
    "2011b ) :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the intercept of the line and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are related to the respective amplitude and width of the function .",
    "the exponential cut - off function for the rise has a characteristic time @xmath37 and a phase zero - point @xmath38 , while @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are free parameters .",
    "all of the parameters are allowed to vary during the fit .",
    "( _ nb : equation [ equ : stretch ] is used throughout this investigation to fit the individual filter lcs as well as the bolometric lcs_. )    next , the following relation was used to transform equation [ equ : stretch ] by the average stretch and luminosity factors in table [ table : grb_sk ] :    @xmath42    thus for events where it is not possible to construct a complete bolometric lc from individual filters , the average stretch and luminosity factors were used to transform equation [ equ : stretch ] using equation [ equ : stretch2 ] . then equation [ equ : stretch2 ] is plotted along with the arnett model to determine the bolometric properties of each of the ibc sne .    ideally the foreground and",
    "rest - frame extinction needs to be determined , as well as the photospheric velocity for each event .",
    "proper knowledge of the total extinction along the line of sight is necessary to properly calculate the amount of nickel created during the explosion ( as the overall peak brightness of the bolometric lc is determined by how much nickel is present in the ejecta ) .",
    "the photospheric velocity is needed to determine the amount of material in the ejecta as well as the kinetic energy of the explosion . for events where the rest - frame extinction is not known ,",
    "the nickel masses derived in tables [ table : grb_bol ] and [ table : sn_bol ] can be regarded as lower limits to the total nickel present .",
    "the validity of the method depends on creating accurate k - corrected lcs of sn 1998bw at the redshift of each sn in the sample . to do this",
    "a personally written program in c has been used .",
    "the program calculates the rest - frame filters lcs for each sn and interpolates in frequency and time over the original lcs of sn 1998bw , and then uses the luminosity distance to rescale the flux density .",
    "gnuplot was used to perform the fits , which uses a linear or non - linear least - squares fitting algorithm to minimize @xmath43 . in the case of equation [ equ : stretch ] and [ equ : stretch2 ] , the non - linear least - squares fitting algorithm",
    "the gnuplot routine * fit * uses the marquardt - levenberg algorithm , which selects parameter values using an iterative process , and continues until the fit converges , i.e. when @xmath43 is less than the pre - defined variable _",
    "fit_limit_. the errors quoted by * fit * are parameter error estimates , i.e. `` standard errors '' rather than confidence intervals , and are calculated in the same way as the standard errors of a linear least - squares problem .",
    "it is worth considering that the quoted errors by * fit * tend to be generally over - optimistic , but are useful for qualitative purposes .",
    "the errors in the bolometric properties have been computed by considering the maximum and minimum stretch and luminosity factors , as well as the distribution of velocities around the average value ( for those events where we have used an average ejecta velocity ) .",
    "it must be stressed that we are only interested in determining the stretch and luminosity factors of the various sne up to the first @xmath44 days after the explosion , i.e. during the `` photospheric phase '' for which the arnett model is valid .",
    "therefore , to determine their peak and width relative to the template sn , the sn lcs were fit during this time frame only , and no attempt was made to ascertain a fit to the exponential tail of each sn relative to the template sn .",
    "the photospheric velocities of 35 ibc sne were collected from the literature : 7 grb / xrf , 11 ib , 10 ic and 7 ic - bl sne ( table [ table : vel ] ) .",
    "note that all of the available photospheric velocities available in the literature were gathered , and not just the events in the sample , so to give extra statistical weight to the calculated average velocities .    from table [ table : vel",
    "] we can see that ib and ic sne have similar ejecta velocities .",
    "it is seen that the average photospheric velocities of the ib sne is @xmath45 km s@xmath7 , while for the ic sne is @xmath46 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the standard deviations of these averages are roughly @xmath47 km s@xmath7 .",
    "thus , when determining the bolometric properties of those ib and ic sne that do not have a known photospheric velocity , an average velocity of @xmath48 km s@xmath7 is used , where the @xmath49 km s@xmath7 reflects the distribution of velocities around this average value .    for the ic - bl sample , there is a much wider spread in the photospheric velocities , and the value @xmath50 km s@xmath7 has been adopted , which again reflects the distribution of velocities of this sn subtype .",
    "finally , for the seven grb / xrf sne that have measured ejecta velocities , a value of @xmath51 km s@xmath7 is used .",
    "the first step is to determine the validity of the method ( i.e. if one can use the average stretch and luminosity factor of the individual @xmath0 lcs as a proxy of the overall width and brightness of the bolometric lc ) .",
    "to do this i investigated two case studies : xrf 100316d / sn 2010bh and xrf 060218 / sn 2006aj",
    ".      1 .   determine the stretch and luminosity factors of sn 2010bh and sn 2006aj in @xmath0 ( which have been corrected for foreground and rest - frame extinction ) relative to sn 1998bw .",

    "@xcite pointed out that the early lc contains an additional source of flux , which is likely due to light coming from shock - heated stellar material .",

    "finally , the arnett model is also plotted to fit the sn 2010bh bolometric lc .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig:16d_bvri ] reveals that the transformed bolometric lc of sn 1998bw matches well to the original @xmath0 bolometric lc of sn 2010bh after five days , as does equation [ equ : stretch2 ] . when the arnett model is fit to the @xmath0 bolometric lc of sn 2010bh , and using a photospheric velocity of @xmath55 km s@xmath7 ( chornock et al .",
