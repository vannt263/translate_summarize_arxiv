    "galaxy clusters  the largest bound structures in the universe  are believed to grow hierarchically via mergers of galaxy groups and smaller sub - clusters and from accretion of gas and dark matter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the energy from mergers is largely dissipated in the gas within the cluster and often leaves an imprint on the distribution of the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) .",

    "studies of such disturbances provide a key laboratory to study the gas dynamics within an evolving system .",
    "major mergers of galaxy clusters are particularly important , since these relatively rare and energetic events have the most dramatic , long - lasting effects on the cluster gas , and hence play a key role in the energy budget and thermodynamic evolution of galaxy clusters .    the galaxy cluster , associated with the powerful radio galaxy 3c 438 , is included in the _ planck _ 2015 release @xcite .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of this detection is @xmath6 , making this cluster among the top @xmath7 of the most significant detections in planck s 1653 total cluster detections .",
    "this is confirmed by the mass estimate obtained from the @xmath8 scaling relation , which estimates the total mass of the galaxy cluster to be @xmath9 .",
    "the galaxy cluster around 3c 438 has been previously observed by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "the short 30 ks observation demonstrated the extremely hot icm temperature , which made it one of the hottest clusters , rivaling the `` bullet '' cluster @xcite .",
    "these data revealed surface brightness discontinuities extending more than 550 kpc ( @xmath10 ) . to explain the origin of the complex morphology , @xcite suggested that it may either arise from the result of a radio outburst or an on - going major merger .",

    "the redshift of 3c 438 is @xmath15 , which implies a linear scale of 261 kpc arcmin@xmath16 and a luminosity distance of 1493.2 mpc .",
    "the galaxy cluster lies at low galactic latitude and has a correspondingly large line - of - sight column density .",
    "based on the iras @xmath17 m dust map and using the relation between hydrogen column density ( @xmath18 ) and optical extinction ( @xmath19 ) we computed @xmath20 @xcite .",

    ", we used the ciao wavdetect tool and searched for point sources in the @xmath21 kev energy range .",
    "we optimize the efficiency of the source detection algorithm by searching for sources on the wavelet scale sizes of 1.0 , 1.414 , 2 , 2.828 , 4 , 5.567 , 8 , and by modifying the _ ellsigma _ parameter to 4.0 .",
    "the detected point sources were then masked out from all further analysis of the icm .",
    "the observations were then individually filtered for flare - contaminated intervals . to do this , we extracted light curves in the @xmath22 kev energy range since _",
    "chandra _ is most sensitive to solar flares at these energies @xcite .",
    "we then binned the light curves into 200-second bins , and computed the mean count rate on the acis - s3 detector .",
    "we removed all time bins where the count rates differed from the mean by @xmath23 sigma .",
    "only one observation , obs - id 3967 , was slightly flare contaminated , with about 30% of the exposure time excluded .",
    "the resulting total clean exposure time is 153.3 ks .    to account for vignetting effects , we created weighted exposure maps for each observation , filtered for an energy range of 0.5 to 4 kev .",
    "the exposure maps were made assuming an optically - thin thermal plasma emission model ( apec model in xspec ) with parameters of @xmath24 and @xmath25 kev , and abundance of @xmath26 solar .",
    "this particular choice of spectrum was determined by the parameter values generated by a best - fit spectrum for a circular region centered on the cluster s core with a radius of @xmath27 .",
    "the individual exposure maps were projected to the coordinate system of obs - id 12879 and were co - added for further analysis .",
    "the galaxy cluster associated with 3c 438 is located at low galactic latitude and , thus , has a high line - of - sight column density , @xmath24 . due to the high level of soft galactic emission ,",
    "the acis blank - sky files provided in the chandra calibration database can not accurately account for the background components .",
    "since the blank - sky dataset has been produced using a set of _ chandra _ observations at high galactic latitude , by utilizing these background data , the sky background components would be over - subtracted at energies below approximately 2 kev .",
    "for this reason , we opted to use local regions to account for the sky and instrumental background components .",
    "when creating the background files , the fact that the cluster extends onto two detectors , acis - s2 and acis - s3 , had to be taken into account .",
    "to this end , we used the local background level on acis - s3 to account for the background on this detector , while we used the average background levels of acis - i2 and acis - i3 to account for the background level on acis - s2 . for each case , the background levels were re - normalized using the count rate ratios observed in the @xmath28 kev band .",

    "the outer discontinuity is a shock front located at @xmath27 , or 800 kpc from the center of the cluster .",
    "the surface brightness of the outer discontinuity exhibits an angular shape similar to a mach cone , as opposed to a circular shape centered on the cluster core.,width=302 ]",

    "chandra _ x - ray images of the core ( left panel ) and the large scale surroundings ( right panel ) of the galaxy cluster .",
    "both images are smoothed with a gaussian with a kernel size of three pixels .",
    "bright resolved point sources are excluded and for illustration purposes , we filled their former locations with the level of the surrounding x - ray emission using the ciao dmfilth tool .",
    "these images demonstrate significant x - ray emission originating from the optically - thin hot gas with @xmath30 kev ( see section [ sec : profiles ] ) .",
    "the x - ray images reveal the complex distribution of the hot gas both in the core and at large scales , suggesting that the cluster has not yet settled into a relaxed state .",
    "the most striking feature is the surface brightness discontinuity located at about @xmath31 ( @xmath32 kpc ) from the cluster core , which extends more than @xmath10 ( 550 kpc ) . at even larger scales  at about @xmath27 ( @xmath33 kpc ) from the cluster core  another surface brightness discontinuity is present .",
    "overall , these discontinuities suggest that the cluster is highly disturbed on large scales , and the features may be the result of a recent interaction or merger .",
    "the presence of two sharp surface brightness discontinuities is similar to that observed in the `` bullet cluster , '' which is the prototypical example of two clusters undergoing a supersonic merger @xcite . to constrain the origin of the sharp surface brightness features",
    ", we measure the temperature and pressure jumps across the surface brightness discontinuities .",
    "this will allow us to probe whether the inner surface brightness jump originates from a supersonic infall and if the outer discontinuity can be attributed to a bow shock , or whether this is due to some large scale subsonic motions such as sloshing @xcite .        .",
    "the circular wedges extend @xmath34 to the east and the box has a size of @xmath35 .",

    "the density and temperature profiles together will allow us to derive the pressure jump across the edges , and hence reveal the origin of the discontinuities .",
    "since the cluster gas exhibits high temperatures , we extract the surface brightness and density profiles from the @xmath29 kev band x - ray images , thereby maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sb ] , we plot the background - subtracted , vignetting - corrected surface brightness profiles of the cluster gas . to extract the profiles , we utilized circular wedges towards the east and the west with position angles of @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "since we aimed to align the position of the regions with the sharp discontinuities in the hot gas distribution , the regions are centered south of the cluster s core ( ra = 21:55:50.65 , dec = + 37:59:57.11 ) .",
    "the surface brightness profiles confirm the picture hinted by the images .",
    "the profile towards the east demonstrates two distinct jumps at radii of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where the surface brightness drops by a factor of about 10 .",
    "as opposed to this , the profile towards the west does not reveal any significant surface brightness jumps , and instead exhibits a gradual decrease .",
    "although the projected surface brightness profile points out the approximate locations of the discontinuities , due to projection effects , their exact positions relative to the center of mass can not be determined from these profiles . to constrain the positions of the gas density jumps and determine their magnitudes",
    ", we perform de - projection analysis and build de - projected density profiles . to this end",
    ", we fit the inner discontinuity by describing the surface brightness profile within each wedge assuming spherical symmetry and isothermal temperature for the gas .",
    "we assume that the gas density follows a @xmath40-model inside the discontinuity and a power law model outside the edge .",
    "for the outer jump we used two power law models , where the parameters of the first power law were fixed at the values obtained from those of the inner jump .",
    "these models are described mathematically as : @xmath41^{-3\\beta/2 } ,              & \\mbox{\\hspace{0.9 cm } $ r \\leq r_{\\rm cut}$}\\\\ b \\left(r / r_{\\rm c}\\right)^{-\\alpha } ,              & \\mbox{\\hspace{0.9 cm } $ r > r_{\\rm cut}$}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq : compression}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the radius of the cluster core , and @xmath43 is the radius at which a density jump occurs . here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related by : @xmath46^{-3\\beta/2}}{c \\left(r_{\\rm cut}/r_{\\rm c}\\right)^{-\\alpha}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the density jump . when describing the gas density of the inner discontinuity , it is important to realize that the surface brightness profile was not centered on the peak of the x - ray surface brightness , coincident with the brightest cluster galaxy , the host galaxy of 3c 438 .",
    "this results in a virtually flat density profile within the inner @xmath48 ( figure [ fig : sb ] right panel ) .",
    "a direct consequence of fitting the flat density profile with a @xmath40-model is that @xmath40 and @xmath42 parameters became degenerate .",
    "to avoid this difficulty , we fixed the value of the former parameter at @xmath49 .",
    "it is possible that a second brightest cluster galaxy is near the vertex of the defined sectors .",
    "however , we were unable to confirm the presence of such a galaxy due the absence of deep and large field - of - view images directed towards 3c 438 .    by utilizing the proffit software package @xcite",
    ", we fit the de - projected density profiles obtained from the @xmath29 kev band images .",
    "the inner and outer jumps were fit using the regions between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively . by fitting the density profiles with the above described models",
    ", we obtained a density drop of a factor of @xmath52 at @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath55 . by combining the best - fit parameters for the density profile",
    ", we build the de - projected gas density profile in figure [ fig : deproject ] .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table 2 .",
    "the second component required to compute the pressure jumps is the temperature profiles . to probe the temperature distribution of the hot gas across the surface brightness discontinuities ,",
    "we build a temperature profile using circular wedges with a position angle of @xmath37 , as shown in figure [ fig : temp_regions ] .",
    "note that these regions are similar to those used to extract the density profiles , except for the broader applied bins .",
    "in addition , we included a larger @xmath35 rectangular region covering the outskirts of the cluster , which was extracted from the front illuminated detector ccd 6 .",
    "this large region is intended to probe the large - scale gas temperature of the cluster .",
    "we fit the data with a single - temperature apec model , where we fixed the redshift to @xmath56 , the column density to @xmath24 , and metallicity to @xmath26 solar , leaving the temperature and normalization as free parameters .",
    "the obtained temperature profile is shown in figure [ fig : temperature ] .",
    "the profile reveals two evident jumps : at @xmath31 we detect a factor of @xmath57 temperature increase , while at @xmath58 the temperature drops by a factor of @xmath59 .",

    "the plot shows a drop in density by a factor of @xmath1 at @xmath31 , and a drop by a factor of @xmath2 at @xmath27 . ]     and @xmath27 from the center of the cluster.,width=302 ]      based on the magnitude of the density and temperature jumps at the inner and outer discontinuities , we derive the pressures as @xmath72 and compute the pressure ratios between the inside and outside of the jumps .",
    "based on the above computed density and temperature jumps , we find that the pressure ratio is @xmath73 at the inner jump , which indicates approximately continuous pressure within statistical uncertainties . however , at the position of the outer jump , we measure a pressure drop of @xmath74 .",
    "based on the large pressure jump at @xmath27 , we use the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions to find the velocity of the cluster .",
    "these give us :    @xmath75    @xmath76            using equation [ equ : mach_pressure ] and our value for the pressure jump , we find that the 3c 438 cluster is moving at mach @xmath4 . when using equation [ equ : mach_density ] to constrain the mach number , we obtain @xmath77 , which is consistent with that obtained from equation [ equ : mach_pressure ]",
    ". however , we note that due to the proximity of our density ratio to a critical point in the equation , located at @xmath78 , the latter mach number has large uncertainty .",
    "the sound speed in a 5 kev plasma corresponds to @xmath79 by adopting @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus , we find that the sub - cluster is moving supersonically with a velocity of @xmath5 km / s within the intracluster medium .",
    "this value should be considered as a lower limit since we do not account for the surrounding cool gas that is inherently present in any cross - section of the cluster .",
    "this causes the temperature measurement , pressure ratio and , therefore , the bulk velocity to be an underestimate .",
    "the presence of sharp surface brightness discontinuities , combined with the observed pressure ratios across the edges , indicates that the inner discontinuity is a cold front @xcite .",
    "however , the drop in temperature by a factor of @xmath59 at @xmath27 and the drop in density by a factor of @xmath82 imply a factor of @xmath74 drop in gas pressure , which in turn indicates that the outer discontinuity is a shock front",
    ". the temperature patterns , as well as the observed cold front and shock fronts in the cluster , are characteristic of mergers between two roughly equal mass sub - clusters .",
    "thus , the galaxy cluster associated with 3c 438 is likely undergoing a major merger .",
    "moreover , the bulk motion of the gas in the cluster , having a mach number of @xmath4 , signifies a supersonic velocity within the intracluster medium .",
    "along with the cone - like shape of the outer discontinuity ( see figure [ fig : outlines ] ) , which has similarities to the features of the bullet cluster , this high velocity suggests that the outer front is a bow shock .    an important feature to note is the fact that only one core is visible in the cluster . since there is evidence that the 3c 438 cluster is undergoing a major merger , the appearance of only one cluster core hints that one of the clusters may be a non - cool core cluster .",
    "non - cool core clusters have no notable drop in temperature towards the center of the cluster , causing the surface brightness to be more evenly spread @xcite , which would explain the lack of a second nucleus .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario in which at least one of the merging sub - clusters is a non - cool core cluster .",
    "in addition , we derived the ( pseudo ) entropy profile of the sub - cluster using @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the mean molecular weight of the gas .",
    "we compare the entropy profile of the sub - cluster ( figure [ fig : entropy ] ) with the mean entropy profile of cool core clusters and non - cool core clusters @xcite .",
    "the entropy profile of 3c 438 is in good agreement with those observed for non - cool core clusters .",
    "specifically , the entropy profile demonstrates a slow increase in entropy from the center , which is characteristic of non - cool core clusters .",
    "this hints that the second sub - cluster may also be a non - cool core cluster .",
    "thus , these results imply that the galaxy cluster associated with 3c 438 may be undergoing a major merger between two non - cool core clusters .",
    "in spite of its inclusion in the 3c catalog of radio galaxies @xcite , 3c438 has been relatively poorly studied because of its low galactic latitude .",
    "low - resolution radio imaging was presented by @xcite , and high - resolution radio imaging showing the unusual strong jets and weak hotspots of the radio source was carried out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite made maps of the central radio galaxy at 90 ghz detecting the nucleus and hot spots , and the broad band emission from the active nucleus has been well - studied as part of several radio galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "most recently @xcite have carried out a study of the spectral and dynamical ages of the radio galaxy , finding that it began to be active between 3 and 9 myr ago .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that the current radio source has any relationship to the large - scale disturbances seen in the cluster , as argued on energetic grounds by @xcite .",
    "any shock features driven by the currently active radio galaxy would be expected to be seen very close to the radio lobes .",
    "the linear scale of the radio galaxy 3c 438 is @xmath85 kpc @xcite , hence it is about an order of magnitude smaller than the surface brightness discontinuities presented in this work . to probe the radio emission on scales comparable with the bow shock",
    ", we present the @xmath86 ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) and the 325 mhz westerbork north sky survey ( wenss ) images along with the @xmath29 kev band x - ray image in figure [ fig : nvss ] . due to the low resolution of the nvss image ,",
    "the structure of the radio lobes of the central galaxy are not resolved .",
    "however , the large - scale radio image reveals enhanced emission towards the southeast and northwest of the galaxy cluster .",
    "the origin of these features is not clear .",
    "although the position and symmetric nature of these features hint that they may be associated with the galaxy cluster , we can not rule out the possibility that the emission originates from unresolved sources . to differentiate between these scenarios , and reveal whether these features may be radio relics typically observed around merging galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we would require more sensitive and higher resolution radio maps .",
    "we plan to follow up this x - ray study with additional radio and optical observations .",
    "the presence of a powerful merger shock and the existing low - resolution radio observations suggest that this cluster may host a radio relic . to our knowledge",
    ", no moderate resolution radio observations at low frequency have been made of this cluster .",
    "radio relics are often associated with strong merger shocks , and direct measurement of the shock strength in the x - ray band is critical for elucidating the underlying physics of non - thermal particle acceleration in the relics @xcite . additionally , this system is one of the few known to be in the early stages of a supersonic merger of two roughly equal mass clusters .",
    "other examples include the bullet cluster and abell 520 @xcite .",
    "a survey of the galaxies in the two clusters could provide additional clues to better constrain the dynamics of the system .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to know if the galaxies of the infalling cluster are offset from the gas in a similar manner to what has been observed with the bullet cluster .",
    "in this paper we utilized _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations to characterize the galaxy cluster associated with radio galaxy 3c 438 and to determine the origin of the surface brightness discontinuities .",
    "our main results are :    * we identified two sharp surface brightness edges on the eastern side of the cluster .",
    "the inner jump is located @xmath31 , or 400 kpc , from the center of the cluster , while the outer jump is located @xmath27 , or 800 kpc , from the center of the cluster .",

    "based on the density , temperature , and pressure jumps , we concluded that there is a bow shock at the outer discontinuity and that the gas is moving with a bulk velocity of at least @xmath87 , or @xmath5 km / s . *",
    "finally , only one cluster core was evident in the merger , which was found to be a non - cool core .",
