    "after popper , it is a commonplace opinion in philosophy of science that the ` value ' of definitions besides mathematics is generally low .",
    "nevertheless , for many more practical needs , from jurisprudence to health planning , the definitions are necessary to impose theoretical boundaries of a subject despite of their incompleteness and temporariness .",
    "this highly applies to definitions of drugs and drug use . following the standard definitions @xcite , a _ drug _ is a ` chemical that influences biological function ( other than by providing nutrition or hydration ) ' .",
    "a _ psychoactive drug _ is a ` drug whose influence is in a part on mental functions ' .",
    "abusable psychoactive drug _ is a ` drug whose mental effects are sufficiently pleasant or interesting or helpful that some people choose to take it for a reason other than to relieve a specific malady ' . in our study",
    "we use the term ` drug ' for abusable psychoactive drug regardless of whether it s illicit or not .",
    "drug use is a risk behaviour that does not happen in isolation ; it constitutes an important factor for increasing risk of poor health , along with earlier mortality and morbidity , and has significant consequences for society @xcite .",
    "drug consumption and addiction constitutes a serious problem globally .",
    "it includes numerous risk factors , which are defined as any attribute , characteristic , or event in the life of an individual that increases the probability of drug consumption .",
    "a number of factors are correlated with initial drug use including psychological , social , individual , environmental , and economic factors @xcite .",
    "these factors are likewise associated with a number of personality traits @xcite .",
    "while legal drugs such as sugar , alcohol and tobacco are probably responsible for far more premature death than illegal recreational drugs @xcite , the social and personal consequences of recreational drug use can be highly problematic @xcite .",
    "psychologists have largely agreed that the personality traits of the five factor model ( ffm ) are the most comprehensive and adaptable system for understanding human individual differences @xcite .",
    "the ffm comprises neuroticism ( n ) , extraversion ( e ) , openness to experience ( o ) , agreeableness ( a ) , and conscientiousness ( c ) .",
    "a number of studies have illustrated that personality traits are associated to drug consumption .",
    "roncero et al @xcite highlighted the importance of the relationship between high n and the presence of psychotic symptoms following cocaine - induced drug consumption .",
    "vollrath & torgersen @xcite observed that the personality traits of n , e , and c are highly correlated with hazardous health behaviours .",
    "a low score of c , and high score of e or high score of n correlate strongly with multiple risky health behaviours .",
    "flory et al @xcite found alcohol use to be associated with lower a and c , and higher e. they found also that lower a and c , and higher o are associated with marijuana use .",
    "sutina et al @xcite demonstrated that the relationship between low c and drug consumption is moderated by poverty ; low c is a stronger risk factor for illicit drug usage among those with relatively higher socioeconomic status .",
    "they found that high n , and low a and c are associated with higher risk of drug use ( including cocaine , crack , morphine , codeine , and heroin ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that high n is positively associated with many other addictions like internet addiction , exercise addiction , compulsive buying , and study addiction @xcite .",
    "an individual s personality profile plays a role in becoming a drug user .",
    "terracciano et al @xcite demonstrated that the personality profiles for the users and non - users of nicotine , cannabis , cocaine , and heroin are associated with a ffm of personality samples from different communities .",
    "they also highlight the links between the consumption of these drugs and low c. turiano et al @xcite found a positive correlation between n and o , and drug use , while , increasing scores for c and a decreases risk of drug use .",
    "previous studies demonstrated that participants who use drugs including alcohol and nicotine have a strong positive correlation between a and c and a strong negative correlation for each of these factors with n @xcite .",
    "three high - order personality traits are proposed as endophenotypes for substance use disorders : positive emotionality , negative emotionality , and constraint @xcite .",
    "the statistical characteristics of groups of drug users and non - users have been studied by many authors ( see , for example , terracciano et al @xcite ) .",
    "they found that the personality profile for the users and non - users of tobacco , marijuana , cocaine , and heroin are associated with a higher score on n and a very low score for c. sensation seeking is also higher for users of recreational drugs @xcite .",
    "the problem of risk evaluation for individuals is much more complex .",
    "this was explored very recently by yasnitskiy et al @xcite , valeroa et al @xcite and bulut & bucak @xcite .",
    "both individual and environmental factors predict substance use and different patterns of interaction among these factors may have different implications @xcite .",
    "age is a very important attribute for diagnosis and prognosis of substance use disorders .",
    "in particular , early adolescent onset of substance use is a robust predictor of future substance use disorders @xcite .",
    "valeroa et al @xcite evaluated the individual risk of drug consumption for alcohol , cocaine , opiates , cannabis , ecstasy and amphetamines .",
    "input data were collected using the spanish version of the zuckerman - kuhlman personality questionnaire ( zkpq ) .",
    "two samples were used in this study .",
    "the first one consisted of 336 drug dependent psychiatric patients of one hospital .",
    "the second sample included 486 control individuals .",
    "the authors used a decision tree as a tool to identify the most informative attributes .",
    "the sensitivity of 40% and the specificity of 94% were achieved for the training set .",
    "the main purpose of this research was to test if predicting drug consumption was possible and to identify the most informative attributes using data mining methods .",
    "the decision tree methods were applied to explore the differential role of personality profiles in drug consumer and control individuals .",
    "the two personality factors , neuroticism and anxiety and the zkpq s impulsivity , were found to be most relevant for drug consumption prediction .",
    "low sensitivity ( 40% ) does not provide application of this decision tree to real life problems .",
    "in our study we tested the associations with personality traits for different types of drugs separately using the revised neo five - factor inventory ( neo - ffi - r ) @xcite , the barratt impulsiveness scale version 11 ( bis-11 ) @xcite , and the impulsivity sensation - seeking scale ( impss ) @xcite to assess impulsivity and sensation - seeking respectively .",
    "bulut & bucak @xcite detected a risk rate for teenagers in terms of percentage who are at high risk without focusing on specific addictions .",
    "the attributes were collected by an original questionnaire , which included 25 questions .",
    "the form was filled in by 671 students .",
    "the first 20 questions asked about the teenagers financial situation , temperament type , family and social relations , and cultural preferences .",
    "the last five questions were completed by their teachers and concerned the grade point average of the student for the previous semester according to a 5-point grading system , whether the student had been given any disciplinary punishment so far , if the student had alcohol problems , if the student smoked cigarettes or used tobacco products , and whether the student misused substances . in bulut",
    "et al s study there are five risk classes as outputs .",
    "the authors diagnosed teenagers risk to be a drug abuser using seven types of classification algorithms : @xmath0-nearest neighbor , id3 and c4.5 decision tree based algorithms , nave bayes classifier , nave bayes / decision trees hybrid approach , one - attribute - rule , and projective adaptive resonance theory .",
    "the classification accuracy of the best classifier was reported as 98% .",
    "yasnitskiy et al @xcite , attempted to evaluate the individual s risk of illicit drug consumption and to recommend the most efficient changes in the individual s social environment to reduce this risk .",
    "the input and output features were collected by an original questionnaire .",
    "the attributes consisted of : level of education , having friends who use drugs , temperament type , number of children in the family , financial situation , alcohol drinking and smoking , family relations ( cases of physical , emotional and psychological abuse , level of trust and happiness in the family ) .",
    "there were 72 participants .",
    "a neural network model was used to evaluate the importance of attributes for diagnosis of the tendency to drug addiction .",
    "a series of virtual experiments was performed for several test patients ( drug users ) to evaluate how it is possible to control the propensity for drug addiction .",
    "the most effective change of social environment features was predicted for each patient .",
    "the recommended changes depended on the personal profile , and significantly varied for different patients .",
    "this approach produced individual bespoke advice for decreasing drug dependence .    in our study , the database was collected by an anonymous online survey methodology by elaine fehrman yielding 2051 respondents .",
    "the database is available online @xcite .",
    "twelve attributes are known for each respondent : personality measurements which include n , e , o , a , and c scores from neo - ffi - r , impulsivity ( imp . ) from ( bis-11 ) , sensation seeking ( ss ) from ( impss ) , level of education ( edu . ) , age , gender , country of residence , and ethnicity .",
    "the data set contains information on the consumption of 18 central nervous system psychoactive drugs including alcohol , amphetamines , amyl nitrite , benzodiazepines , cannabis , chocolate , cocaine , caffeine , crack , ecstasy , heroin , ketamine , legal highs , lsd , methadone , magic mushrooms ( mmushrooms ) , nicotine , and volatile substance abuse ( vsa ) , and one fictitious drug ( semeron ) which was introduced to identify over - claimers .",
    "participants selected for each drug either they never used this drug , used it over a decade ago , or in the last decade , year , month , week , or day .",
    "participants were asked about substances , which were classified as central nervous system depressants , stimulants , or hallucinogens .",
    "the depressant drugs comprised alcohol , amyl nitrite , benzodiazepines , tranquilizers , gamma - hydroxybutyrate solvents and inhalants , and opiates such as heroin and methadone / prescribed opiates . the stimulants consisted of amphetamines , nicotine , cocaine powder , crack cocaine , caffeine , and chocolate . although chocolate contains caffeine , data for chocolate",
    "was measured separately , given that it may induce parallel psychopharmacological and behavioural effects in individuals congruent to other addictive substances @xcite .",
    "the hallucinogens included cannabis , ecstasy , ketamine , lsd , and magic mushrooms .",
    "legal highs such as mephedrone , salvia , and various legal smoking mixtures were also measured .",
    "we use four different definitions of ` drug users ' based on the recency of use .",
    "firstly , two isolated categories ( ` never used ' and ` used over a decade ago ' ) are placed into the class of non - users , and all other categories are merged to form the class of users . secondly , we merge the categories ` used in last decade ' , ` used over a decade ago ' and ` never used ' into the group of non - users and place four other categories ( ` used in last year - month - week - day ' ) into group of users .",
    "this classification is called ` year - based ' one .",
    "also ` month - based ' and ` week - based ' user / non - user separations are considered .",
    "the objective of the study was to assess the potential effect of big five personality traits , impulsivity , sensation - seeking , and demographic data on drug consumption for different drugs , groups of drugs and for different definitions of drug users .",
    "the study had two purposes : ( i ) to identify the association of personality profiles ( i.e. neo - ffi - r ) with drug consumption and ( ii ) to predict the risk of drug consumption for each individual according to their personality profiles .",
    "part of the results was presented in the preprint  @xcite .",
    "the sample was created by an anonymous online survey .",
    "it was found to be biased when compared with the general population , which was indicated from comparison to the data published by egan , et al @xcite and costa jr & mccrae @xcite .",
    "such a bias is usual for clinical cohorts @xcite .",
    "our study reveals that the personality profiles are strongly associated with belonging to groups of the users and non - users of the 18 drugs . for analysis , we use the following subdivision of the sample t-@xmath1 : the interval 44 - 49 indicates a moderately low score , @xmath2 , the interval 49 - 51 indicates a neutral score @xmath3 , and the interval 51 - 56 indicates a moderately high @xmath4 score .",
    "we found that the n and o scores of drug users of all 18 drugs are moderately high @xmath4 or neutral @xmath3 , except for crack usage for the week - based classification , for which the o score is moderately low @xmath2 .",
    "the a and c scores are moderately low @xmath2 or neutral @xmath3 for all groups of drug users and all user / non - user separations . for most groups of illicit drug users the a and c scores are moderately low @xmath2 except two exclusions :",
    "the a score is neutral @xmath3 in the year - based classification for lsd users and in the week - based classification for lsd and magic mushrooms users .",
    "the a and c scores for groups of legal drugs users ( i.e. alcohol , chocolate , caffeine , and nicotine ) are neutral @xmath3 , apart from nicotine users , whose c score is moderately low @xmath2 for all bases of user / non - user separation .",
    "the impact of the e score is drug specific .",
    "for example , for the week - based user / non - user separation the e scores are :    * the e score of users is moderately low @xmath2 for amphetamines , amyl nitrite , benzodiazepines , heroin , ketamine , legal highs , methadone , and crack ; * the e score of users is moderately high @xmath4 for cocaine , ecstasy , lsd , magic mushrooms , and vsa ; * the e score of users is neutral @xmath3 for alcohol , caffeine , chocolate , cannabis , and nicotine .    for more details",
    "see section ` comparison of personality traits means for drug users and non - users ' in ` results ' .",
    "usage of some drugs are significantly correlated .",
    "the structure of these correlations is analysed in section ` correlation between usage of different drugs ' .",
    "two correlation measures are utilised : the pearson correlation coefficient ( pcc ) and the relative information gain ( rig ) .",
    "we found three groups of drugs with highly correlated use .",
    "the central element is clearly identified for each group .",
    "these centres are : _ heroin , ecstasy , and benzodiazepines_. it means that the drug consumption has a ` modular structure ' .",
    "the modular structure has clear reflection in the correlation graph .",
    "the idea to merge the correlated attributes into ` modules ' called as _ correlation pleiades _ is popular in biology @xcite .",
    "the concept of correlation pleiades was introduced in biostatistics in 1931 @xcite .",
    "they were used for identification of the modular structure in evolutionary physiology @xcite . according to berg @xcite ,",
    "correlation pleiades are clusters of correlated traits . in our approach",
    ", we distinguish the core and the peripheral elements of correlation pleiades and allow different pleiads to have small intersections in their periphery . ` soft ' clustering algorithms",
    "relax the restriction that each data object is assigned to only one cluster ( like probabilistic @xcite or fuzzy @xcite clustering ) .",
    "see the book of r. xu and d. wunsch @xcite for the modern review of hard and soft clustering .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a discussion of clustering in graphs with intersections .",
    "the three groups of correlated drugs centered around heroin , ecstasy , and benzodiazepines are defined for the decade- , year- , month- , and week - based classifications :    * the heroin pleiad includes crack , cocaine , methadone , and heroin ; * the ecstasy pleiad consists of amphetamines , cannabis , cocaine , ketamine , lsd , magic mushrooms , legal highs , and ecstasy ; * the benzodiazepines pleiad contains methadone , amphetamines , cocaine , and benzodiazepines .",
    "analysis of the intersections between correlation pleiads of drugs can generate important question and hypotheses :    * why is cocaine a peripherical member of all pleiads ? * why does methadone belong to the periphery of both the heroin and benzodiazepines pleiades ? *",
    "do these intersections reflect the structure of individual drug consumption or the structure of the groups of drug consumers ?",
    "correlation analysis of the decade - based classification problems demonstrates that the consumption of legal drugs ( i.e. alcohol , chocolate and caffeine ) is not correlated with consumption of other drugs .",
    "the consumptions of seven illicit drugs ( i.e. amphetamines , cannabis , cocaine , ecstasy , legal highs , lsd , and mushrooms ) are symmetrically correlated ( when the correlations are measured by relative information gain , which is not symmetric a priori ) .",
    "there are also many strongly asymmetric correlations .",
    "for example , knowledge of amphetamines , cocaine , ecstasy , legal highs , lsd , and magic mushroom consumption is useful for the evaluation of ketamine consumption , but on the other hand , knowledge of ketamine consumption is significantly less useful for the evaluation of usage of the drugs listed above .    in this study , we evaluated the individual drug consumption risk separately , for each drug and pleiad of drugs .",
    "we also analyzed interrelations between the individual drug consumption risks for different drugs .",
    "we applied several data mining approaches : decision tree , random forest , @xmath0-nearest neighbors , linear discriminant analysis , gaussian mixture , probability density function estimation , logistic regression and nave bayes .",
    "the quality of classification was surprisingly high .",
    "we tested all the classifiers by _ leave - one - out cross validation_. the best results with sensitivity and specificity being greater than 75% were achieved for cannabis , crack , ecstasy , legal highs , lsd , and vsa .",
    "sensitivity and specificity greater than 70% were achieved for the following drugs : amphetamines , amyl nitrite , benzodiazepines , chocolate , caffeine , heroin , ketamine , methadone and nicotine .",
    "the poorest result was obtained for prediction of alcohol consumption .",
    "an exhaustive search was performed to select the most effective subset of input features , and data mining methods to classify users and non - users for each drug .",
    "users are defined for each correlation pleiad of drugs as users of any of the drug from the pleiade .",
    "we consider the classification problem for drug pleiades for the decade- , year- , month- , and week - based user / non - user separations .",
    "these problems are much better balanced for short periods ( the week - based user definition ) than the classification problems for separate drugs .",
    "for example , there are 184 users for the heroin pleiad but only 29 heroin users in the database for the week - based definition of users .",
    "the quality of classification is high .",
    "for example , for the month - based user / non - user separation of the heroin pleiad consumption , the best classifier is a decision tree with five features and sensitivity 74.18% and specificity 74.11% .",
    "a decision tree with seven attributes is the best classifier for the year - based classification problem of the ecstasy pleiad users / non - users and has sensitivity 80.65% and specificity 80.72% . in the week - based separation of the benzodiazepines",
    "pleiad users / non - users , the best classifier is a decision tree with five features , sensitivity 75.10% , and specificity 75.76% .    the creation of classifiers provided the capability to evaluate the risk of drug consumption in relation to individuals .",
    "the risk map is a useful tool for data visualisation and for the generation of hypotheses for further study ( see section ` risk evaluation for the decade - based user / non - user separation ' ) .",
    "the main results of the work are :    * presentation and descriptive analysis of a database with information of 1885 respondents and usage of 18 drugs . *",
    "demonstration that the personality traits ( five factor model , impulsivity , and sensation seeking ) together with simple demographic data give the possibility of predicting the risk of consumption of individual drugs with sensitivity and specificity above 70% for most drugs . *",
    "the best classifiers and most significant predictors are found for each individual drug in question .",
    "* revelation of three correlation pleiads of drugs , that are the clusters of drugs with correlated consumption centered around heroin , ecstasy , and benzodiazepines .",
    "* the best robust classifiers and most significant predictors are found for use of pleiads of drugs . *",
    "the risk map technology is developed for the visualization of the probability of drug consumption .",
    "the database was collected by elaine fehrman between march 2011 and march 2012 . in january 2011",
    ", the research proposal was approved by the university of leicester s forensic psychology ethical advisory group , and subsequently received favourable opinion from the university of leicester school of psychology s research ethics committee ( prec ) .",
    "the data are available online @xcite .",
    "an online survey tool from survey gizmo was employed to gather data which maximised anonymity , this being particularly relevant to canvassing respondents views , given the sensitive nature of drug use .",
    "all participants were required to declare themselves at least 18 years of age prior to informed consent being given .",
    "the study recruited 2051 participants over a 12-month recruitment period .",
    "of these persons , 166 did not respond correctly to a validity check built into the middle of the scale , so were presumed to being inattentive to the questions being asked .",
    "nine of these persons were found to also have endorsed using a fictitious recreational drug , and which was included precisely to identify respondents who over - claim , as have other studies of this kind @xcite .",
    "this led a useable sample of 1885 participants ( male / female = 943/942 ) .",
    "the snowball sampling methodology recruited a primarily ( 93.7% ) native english - speaking sample , with participants from the uk ( 1044 ; 55.4% ) , the usa ( 557 ; 29.5% ) , canada ( 87 ; 4.6% ) , australia ( 54 ; 2.9% ) , new zealand ( 5 ; 0.3% ) and ireland ( 20 ; 1.1% ) .",
    "a total of 118 ( 6.3% ) came from a diversity of other countries , none of whom individually met 1% of the sample or did not declare the country of location . further optimizing anonymity , persons reported their age band , rather than their exact age ; 18 - 24 years ( 643 ; 34.1% ) , 25 - 34 years ( 481 ; 25.5% ) , 35 - 44 years ( 356 ; 18.9% ) , 45 - 54 years ( 294 ; 15.6% ) , 55 - 64 ( 93 ; 4.9% ) , and over 65 ( 18 ; 1% ) .",
    "this indicates that although the largest age cohort band were in the 18 to 24 range , some 40% of the cohort was 35 or above , which is an age range often missed in studies of this kind .",
    "the sample recruited was highly educated , with just under two thirds ( 59.5% ) educated to , at least , degree or professional certificate level : 14.4% ( 271 ) reported holding a professional certificate or diploma , 25.5% ( 481 ) an undergraduate degree , 15% ( 284 ) a master s degree , and 4.7% ( 89 ) a doctorate .",
    "approximately 26.8% ( 506 ) of the sample had received some college or university tuition although they did not hold any certificates ; lastly , 13.6% ( 257 ) had left school at the age of 18 or younger .",
    "participants were asked to indicate which racial category was broadly representative of their cultural background . an overwhelming majority ( 91.2% ; 1720 )",
    "reported being white , ( 1.8% ; 33 ) stated they were black , and ( 1.4% ; 26 ) asian .",
    "the remainder of the sample ( 5.6% ; 106 ) described themselves as ` other ' or ` mixed ' categories .",
    "this small number of persons belonging to specific non - white ethnicities precludes any analyses involving racial categories .      in order to assess personality traits of the sample , the revised neo five - factor inventory ( neo - ffi - r ) questionnaire",
    "was employed @xcite .",
    "the neo - ffi - r is a highly reliable measure of basic personality domains ; internal consistencies are 0.84 ( n ) ; 0.78 ( e ) ; 0.78 ( o ) ; 0.77 ( a ) , and 0.75 ( c ) egan @xcite .",
    "the scale is a 60-item inventory comprised of five personality domains or factors .",
    "the neo - ffi - r is a shortened version of the revised neo - personality inventory ( neo - pi - r ) @xcite .",
    "the five factors are : n , e , o , a , and c with 12 items per domain .",
    "the five traits can be summarized as :    1 .",
    "_ neuroticism _ ( * n * ) is a long - term tendency to experience negative emotions such as nervousness , tension , anxiety and depression ; 2 .",
    "_ extraversion _ ( * e * ) is manifested in outgoing , warm , active , assertive , talkative , cheerful , and in search of stimulation characteristics ; 3 .",
    "_ openness to experience _",
    "( * o * ) is a general appreciation for art , unusual ideas , and imaginative , creative , unconventional , and wide interests , 4 .",
    "_ agreeableness _ ( * a * ) is a dimension of interpersonal relations , characterized by altruism , trust , modesty , kindness , compassion and cooperativeness ; 5 .",
    "_ conscientiousness _ ( * c * ) is a tendency to be organized and dependable , strong - willed , persistent , reliable , and efficient .",
    "all of these domains are hierarchically defined by specific facets @xcite .",
    "egan et al @xcite observe that the score o and e domains of the neo - ffi instrument are less reliable than n , a , and c.    participants were asked to read the 60 neo - ffi - r statements and indicate on a five - point likert scale how much a given item applied to them ( i.e. 0 = ` strongly disagree ' , 1 = ` disagree ' , 2 = ` neutral ' , 3 = ` agree ' , to 4 = ` strongly agree ' ) .",
    "we expected that drug usage is associated with high n , and low a and c. the darker dimension of personality can be described in terms of high n and low a and c , whereas much of the anti - social behaviour in non - clinical persons appears underpinned by high n and low c @xcite .",
    "the so - called ` _ _ negative urgency _ _ ' is the tendency to act rashly when distressed , and characterized by high n , low c , and low a @xcite .",
    "the negative urgency is partially proved below for users of most of the illegal drugs . in addition",
    ", our findings suggest that o is higher for drug users .",
    "the second measure used was the barratt impulsiveness scale ( bis-11 ) @xcite .",
    "the bis-11 is a 30-item self - report questionnaire , which measures the behavioural construct of impulsiveness , and comprises three subscales : motor impulsiveness , attentional impulsiveness , and non - planning .",
    "the ` motor ' aspect reflects acting without thinking , the ` attentional ' component poor concentration and thought intrusions , and the ` non - planning ' a lack of consideration for consequences @xcite .",
    "the scale s items are scored on a four - point likert scale .",
    "this study modified the response range to make it compatible with previous related studies @xcite .",
    "a score of five usually connotes the most impulsive response although some items are reverse - scored to prevent response bias .",
    "items are aggregated , and the higher bis-11 scores , the higher the impulsivity level @xcite . the bis-11 is regarded a reliable psychometric instrument with good test - retest reliability ( spearman s rho is equal to 0.83 ) and internal consistency ( cronbach s alpha is equal to 0.83 ; @xcite .",
    "the third measurement tool employed was the impulsiveness sensation - seeking ( impss ) .",
    "although the impss combines the traits of impulsivity and sensation - seeking , it is regarded as a measure of a general sensation - seeking trait @xcite .",
    "the scale consists of 19 statements in true - false format , comprising eight items measuring impulsivity ( * imp * ) , and 11 items gauging sensation - seeking ( * ss * ) . the impss is considered a valid and reliable measure of high risk behavioural correlates such as , substance misuse @xcite .",
    "participants were questioned concerning their use of 18 legal and illegal drugs ( alcohol , amphetamines , amyl nitrite , benzodiazepines , cannabis , chocolate , cocaine , caffeine , crack , ecstasy , heroin , ketamine , legal highs , lsd , methadone , magic mushrooms , nicotine and volatile substance abuse ( vsa ) ) and one fictitious drug ( semeron ) which was introduced to identify over - claimers .",
    "it was recognised at the outset of this study that drug use research regularly ( and spuriously ) dichotomises individuals as users or non - users , without due regard to their frequency or duration / desistance of drug use @xcite . in this study ,",
    "finer distinctions concerning the measurement of drug use have been deployed , due to the potential for the existence of qualitative differences amongst individuals with varying usage levels . in relation to each drug , respondents were asked to indicate if they never used this drug , used it over a decade ago , or in the last decade , year , month , week , or day .",
    "this format captured the breadth of a drug - using career , and the specific recency of use .",
    "different categories of drug users are depicted in fig  [ categoriesfig:1 ] .",
    "analysis of the classes of drug users shows that part of the classes are nested : participants which belong to the category ` used in last day ' also belong to the categories ` used in last week ' , ` used in last month ' , ` used in last year ' and ` used in last decade ' .",
    "there are two special categories : ` never used ' and ` used over a decade ago ' ( see fig  [ categoriesfig:1 ] ) .",
    "data does not contain a definition of users and non - users groups .",
    "formally only a participant in the class ` never used ' can be called a non - user , but it is not a seminal definition because a participant who used a drug more than decade ago can not be considered a drug user for most applications .",
    "there are several possible way to discriminate participants into groups of users and non - users for binary classification :    1 .   two isolated categories ( ` never used ' and ` used over a decade ago ' ) are placed into the class of non - users with a green background in fig  [ categoriesfig:1 ] and all other categories into the class ` users ' as the simplest version of binary classification .",
    "this classification problem is called ` _ _ decade - based _ _ ' user / non - user separation .",
    "the categories ` used in last decade ' , ` used over a decade ago ' and ` never used ' are merged to form a group of non - users and all other categories are placed into the group of users .",
    "this classification problem is called ` _ _ year - based _ _ ' .",

    "in addition to this analysis , we achieved much more detailed knowledge about the relationship between the personality traits , biographic data and the use of individual drugs or drug clusters by an individual patient .    the analysed database contained 1885 participants and 12 features ( input attributes ) .",
    "these features included five personality traits ( neo - ffi - r ) ; impulsivity ( bis-11 ) , sensation seeking ( impss ) , level of education , age , gender , country of residence , and ethnicity .",

    "it was impossible to completely exclude the possibility that ethnicity and country of residence may be important risk factors , but the dataset has not enough data for most of ethnicities and countries to prove the value of this information . as a result , 10 input features remained : age , edu . ,",
    "n , e , o , a , c , imp . , ss , and gender .",
    "our aim was to predict the risk of drug consumption for an individual .",
    "all input features are ordinal or nominal . to apply data mining methods which were developed for continuous input features we apply catpca technique to quantify data .",
    "we used four different definitions of drug users which differ with regard to the recency of the last drug consumption : the decade - based , year - based , month - based and week - based user / non user separation ( fig .  [ categoriesfig:1 ] ) .",
    "the day - based classification problem is also possible but there is not enough data on drug use during the last day for most drugs    our findings allowed us to draw a number of important conclusions about the associations between personality traits and drug use .",
    "all five personality factors are relevant traits to be taken into account when assessing the risk of drug consumption .",
    "the mean scores for the groups of users of all 18 drugs are moderately high @xmath4 or neutral @xmath3 for n and o , and moderately low @xmath2 for a and c , except for crack usage for the week based classification problem which has a moderately low @xmath2 o score ( see table  [ tab:5c ] and fig  [ averagecrack ] ) .",

    "we tested eight types of classifiers for each drug for the decade - based user definition .",
    "loocv was used to evaluate sensitivity and specificity . in this study",
    "we choose the method which provide maximal value of minimum among sensitivity and specificity as the best one .",
    "the method with maximal sum of the sensitivity and specificity is selected as the best one for two methods with the same minimum among sensitivity and specificity .",
    "there were classifiers with sensitivity and specificity greater than 70% for the decade - based user / non user separation for all drugs except magic mushrooms , alcohol , and cocaine ( table  [ tab:12 ] ) .",
    "this accuracy was unexpectedly high for this type of problem .",
    "the poorest result was obtained for the prediction of alcohol consumption .",
    "the best set of input features was defined for each drug ( table  [ tab:12 ] ) .",
    "an exhaustive search was performed to select the most effective subset of input features , and the best data mining methods to classify users and non - users for each drug .",
    "there were 10 input features .",
    "each of them is an important factor for risk evaluation for the use of some drugs .",
    "however , there was no single most effective classifier using all input features .",
    "the maximal number of attributes used in the best classifiers is six ( out of 10 ) and the minimal number is two .    table  [ tab:12 ] shows the best sets of attributes for user / nonuser classification for different drugs and for the decade - based classification problem .",
    "this table together with its analogues for pleiads of drugs and all decade - year - month - week classification problems ( table  [ tab:12a ] ) are important result of the analysis .",
    "the dt for crack consumption used two features e and c only , and provided sensitivity of 80.63% and specificity of 78.57% .",
    "the dt for vsa consumption used age , edu . ,",
    "e , a , c , and ss , and provided sensitivity 83.48% and specificity 77.64% ( table  [ tab:12 ] ) .",
    "age was a widely used feature which was employed in the best classifiers for 14 drugs for the decade - based classification problem .",
    "gender was used in the best methods for 10 drugs .",
    "we found some unexpected outcomes .",
    "for example , fraction of females which are alcohol users is greater than the fraction of males but the greater part of males consume caffeine ( coffee ) .",
    "most of the features which are not used in the best classifiers are redundant but are not uninformative .",
    "for example , the best classifier for ecstasy consumption used age , ss , and gender and had sensitivity 76.17% and specificity 77.16% .",
    "there exist a dt for prediction of usage of the same drug , which utilizes age , edu .",
    ", o , c , and ss with sensitivity 77.23% and specificity 75.22% , a dt with inputs age , edu . ,",
    "e , o , and a with sensitivity 73.24% and specificity 78.22% , and an advanced @xmath0nn classifier with inputs age , edu .",
    ", n , e , o , c , imp . , ss , and gender with sensitivity 75.63% and specificity 75.75% .",
    "this means that for evaluating the risk of ecstasy usage all input attributes are informative but the required information can be extracted from a subset of attributes .",
    "we demonstrated that there are three groups of drugs with strongly correlated consumption .",
    "that is , the drug usage has a ` modular structure ' .",
    "the idea to merge correlated attributes into ` modules ' is popular in biology .",
    "the modules are called the ` correlation pleiades ' @xcite ( see section ` pleiades of drugs ' ) .",
    "the modular structure contains three modules : the heroin pleiad , ecstasy pleiad , and benzodiazepines pleiad :    * the _ heroin pleiad ( heroinpl ) _ includes crack , cocaine , methadone , and heroin . *",
    "the _ ecstasy pleiad ( ecstasypl ) _ includes amphetamines , cannabis , cocaine , ketamine , lsd , magic mushrooms , legal highs , and ecstasy . * the _ benzodiazepines pleiad ( benzopl ) _ includes contains methadone , amphetamines , and cocaine .",
    "the modular structure has a clear reflection in the correlation graph , fig  [ strongdrugusfig:5 ] .",
    "we define groups of users and non - users for each pleiad . in",
    "most of the databases the classes of users and non - users for most of the individual drugs are imbalanced ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) but the merging the users of all drugs in one class ` drug users ' does not seem to be the best solution because of physiological , psychological and cultural differences between usage of different drugs .",
    "we propose instead to use correlation pleiades for the analysis of drug usage as a solution to the class imbalance problem because for all three pleiades the classes of users and non - users are better balanced ( table  [ tab:13a ] ) and the consumption of different drugs from the same pleiad is correlated .",
    "we applied the eight methods described in the ` risk evaluation methods ' section and selected the best one for each problem for all pleiades .",
    "the results of the classifier selection are presented in table  [ tab:12a ] and the quality of the classification is high .",
    "the majority of the best classifiers for pleiades of drugs has a better accuracy than the classifiers for individual drug usage .",
    "( see table [ tab:12 ] and  [ tab:12a ] ) .",
    "the best classifiers for pleiades of drugs use more input features than the best classifiers for the corresponding individual drugs .",
    "the classification problems for pleiades of drugs are more balanced .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the classifiers for pleiades are more robust than the classifiers for individual drugs .",
    "the user / non - user classifiers can be also used for forming of risk maps .",
    "risk maps are useful tools for data visualisation and hypotheses generation .",
    "these results are important as they examine the question of the relationship between drug use and personality comprehensively and engage the challenge of untangling correlated personality traits ( the ffm , impulsivity , and sensation seeking @xcite ) , and clusters of substance misuse ( the correlation pleiades ) .",
    "the work acknowledged the breadth of a common behaviour which may be transient and leave no impact , or may significantly harm an individual .",
    "we examined drug use behaviour comprehensively in terms of the many kinds of substances that may be used ( from the legal and anodyne , to the deeply harmful ) , as well as the possibility of behavioural over - claiming .",
    "we built into our study the wide temporality of the behaviour indicative of the chronicity of behaviour and trends and fashions ( e.g. the greater use of lsd in the 1960s and 1970s , the rise of ecstasy in the 1980s , some persons being one - off experimenters with recreational drugs , and others using recreational substances on a daily basis ) .",
    "we defined substance use in terms of behaviour rather than legality , as legislation in the field is variable .",
    "our data were gathered before ` legal highs ' emerged as a health concern @xcite so we did not differentiate , for example , synthetic cannabinoids and cathinone - based stimulants ; these substances have been since widely made illegal .",
    "we were nevertheless able to accurately classify users of these substances ( reciprocally , our data were gathered before cannabis decriminalisation in parts of north america , but again , we were able to accurately classify cannabis users ) .",
    "we included control participants who had never used these substances , those who had used them in the distant past , up to and including persons who had used the drug in the past day , avoiding the procrustean data - gathering and classifying methods which may occlude an accurate picture of drug use behaviour and risk @xcite . such rich data and the complex methods used for analysis necessitated a large and substantial sample",
    ".    the study was atheoretical regarding the morality of the behaviour , and did not medicalise or pathologise participants , optimising engagement by persons with heterogeneous drug - use histories .",
    "our study used a rigorous range of data - mining methods beyond those typically used in studies examining the association of drug use and personality in the psychological and psychiatric literature , revealing that decision tree methods were most commonly effective for classifying drug users .",
    "we found that high n , low a , and low c are the most common personality correlates of drug use , these traits being sometimes seen in combination as an indication of higher - order stability and behavioural conformity , and , inverted , are associated with externalisation of distress @xcite .",
    "low stability is also a marker of negative urgency @xcite whereby persons act rashly when distressed .",
    "our research points to the importance of individuals acquiring emotional self - management skills anteceding distress as a means to reduce self - medicating drug - using behaviour , and the risk to health that injudicious or chronic drug use may cause .",

    "<S> the problem of evaluating an individual s risk of drug consumption and misuse is highly important . </S>",
    "<S> an online survey methodology was employed to collect data including big five personality traits ( neo - ffi - r ) , impulsivity ( bis-11 ) , sensation seeking ( impss ) , and demographic information . </S>",
    "<S> the data set contained information on the consumption of 18 central nervous system psychoactive drugs . </S>",
    "<S> correlation analysis demonstrated the existence of groups of drugs with strongly correlated consumption patterns . </S>",
    "<S> three correlation pleiades were identified , named by the central drug in the pleiade : ecstasy , heroin , and benzodiazepines pleiades . </S>",
    "<S> an exhaustive search was performed to select the most effective subset of input features and data mining methods to classify users and non - users for each drug and pleiad . </S>",
    "<S> a number of classification methods were employed ( decision tree , random forest , @xmath0-nearest neighbors , linear discriminant analysis , gaussian mixture , probability density function estimation , logistic regression and nave bayes ) and the most effective classifier was selected for each drug . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of classification was surprisingly high with sensitivity and specificity ( evaluated by leave - one - out cross - validation ) being greater than 70% for almost all classification tasks . </S>",
    "<S> the best results with sensitivity and specificity being greater than 75% were achieved for cannabis , crack , ecstasy , legal highs , lsd , and volatile substance abuse ( vsa ) . </S>"
