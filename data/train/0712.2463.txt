    "it was widely expected @xcite that the rapidity distribution of particles produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions would show a plateau around central rapidities .",
    "although it was not observed at sps energies , there was a rather general belief about its existence in rhic experiments .",
    "now , as the final countdown @xcite to lhc has started , expectations are much more cautious @xcite .",
    "recent results about the rapidity of charged mesons @xcite and pseudorapidity distributions @xcite do not allow for any firm prediction concerning the existence of a plateau at lhc energies . instead of this ,",
    "a new property emerging - extended longitudinal scaling in rapidity distributions .",
    "the shape of the pseudorapidity distribution scales according to the limiting fragmentation hypothesis .",
    "the distributions of particle yields are largely independent of energy over a broad region of rapidity when viewed in the rest frame of one of the colliding particles . in this kinematic region",
    "it is allowed to neglect differences between pseudorapidity and rapidity distribution .    extended longitudinal scaling",
    "was observed in high energy @xmath0 collisions @xcite and is also a property of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . in this paper",
    "we show that the extended longitudinal scaling feature of the shifted rapidity distribution also arises within the thermal model up to the highest rhic energies . however , when an extrapolation is made to lhc energies the extended longitudinal scaling effect vanishes .",
    "this would violate some of lhc predictions based on the extended longitudinal scaling feature @xcite .",
    "the statistical thermal model has been recently extended @xcite to allow for the description of the rapidity distribution of produced particles in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "chemical potentials and the temperature become rapidity dependent quantities . this property corresponds to the changing nature of the expanding fireball .",
    "an extension to the thermal model @xcite is used to calculate the rapidity distributions .",
    "the model uses a gaussian distribution of fireballs centered at zero and described by @xmath1 the rapidity distribution of particle @xmath2 is then calculated by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is obtained from the thermal distribution of hadrons from a single fireball .",
    "it is necessary to assume universality of the chemical freeze - out conditions .",
    "this means that the temperature and the baryonic chemical potential are related via the freeze - out curve deduced from particle yields at varying beam energies .",
    "a parametrization of the universal freeze - out curve is given by @xcite @xmath5    the extension of the thermal model introduces a new energy dependent parameter , the width of the gaussian distribution , @xmath6 .",
    "this parameter is readily determined by fitting the generated distribution to the one found at various experimental energies .",
    "we consider specifically the pion rapidity distributions at sps and rhic energies .     to the experimental data from sps and brahms",
    "are shown . ]",
    "the most abundantly produced particles in nuclear collisions are pions .",
    "the pion rapidity distribution should then display the same features as the total charged particle rapidity distribution .",
    "since the baryon chemical potential has only a minimal influence on the rapidity distribution of pions , this distribution is also an excellent candidate to determine the fireball width .",
    "the experimental pion distributions were used to find the best fit to @xmath6 and these were then used to calculate the rapidity spectra coming from the extended thermal model .",
    "s in the thermal model fitted to experimental data .",
    "the short - dashed line is the prediction based on the landau model ( @xmath7 ) . ]",
    "the results of the fits for the rapidity spectra are shown in figure [ sigmaplt ] .",
    "the experimental distribution width has been proposed @xcite to change with collision energy like @xmath8 .",
    "this is also shown in figure [ sigmaplt ] and it can be seen that the two distribution widths have a similar energy dependence .",
    "it is a remarkable property that this simple analytical @xmath9 fit is applicable to heavy - ion collisions over such a wide range of beam energies .",
    "it appeared for the first time in the classic paper by landau @xcite where the notion of hydrodynamical evolution of a hadronic system was introduced .",
    "this concept was later successfully used for the description of high energy multiparticle production in @xmath10 collisions @xcite .",
    "the differences seen in figure [ sigmaplt ] could be attributed to specific heavy - ion processes such as the cooling , freezing , and evaporation of the primary highly excited blob of dense hadronic matter .    for a comparison with lhc predictions ,",
    "@xmath11 is plotted in figure [ low_scaling ] . here",
    "we can clearly see the similar tails of the four rapidity distributions for the higher sps energies and for rhic .",
    "this is also seen in the experimental data in @xcite .",
    "are 5.36 , 2.9 , 2.569 and 2.222 at rhic 200 gev , sps 17.2 gev , sps 12.3 gev and sps 8.7 gev respectively . ]    by extrapolating the results for @xmath6 to lhc energies , we can make an extrapolation based on the thermal model for the rapidity distribution . using the fitted curve",
    "we obtain @xmath12 . following the prediction based on the landau model curve one would obtain for lhc @xmath13 .",
    "the extrapolation is over a large energy range and thus both values of @xmath6 are shown in figure [ hi_scaling ] for comparison .     and @xmath13 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath14 at rhic and sps are the same as those given in fig .",
    "it can clearly be seen that extended longitudinal scaling does not occur at lhc energies .",
    "thus the extension of the thermal model to describe rapidity distributions is consistent with the concept of extended longitudinal scaling at sps and rhic energies but not at lhc energies",
    ".    a violation of extended longitudinal scaling at lhc energies is also predicted in the string percolation model @xcite .",
    "about thirty - five years ago it was noted in @xcite that the `` possible experimental fact of a gaussian rapidity distribution of produced particle is significant independently of the landau model .",
    "only further detailed calculations of correlations and other fine structure can be expected to establish or disprove the hydrodynamic picture of particle production . ''",
