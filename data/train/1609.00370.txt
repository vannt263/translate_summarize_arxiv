    "the precision of measurements may in principle be improved using quantum mechanical effects , viz . , the quantum aided metrology @xcite . a convenient way of quantifying the precision in parameter estimation , for instance , is via the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) @xcite .",
    "also , non - classical states of light have become a promising resource for the improvement of parameter estimation @xcite . amongst the quantum states of light ( probe states ) which might bring advantages to phase estimation and that have been already discussed in the literature , we may cite the continuous - variable states , either one - mode ( squeezed ) states @xcite or two - mode ( entangled coherent ) states @xcite .",
    "interestingly , schemes employing continuous - variable states in the low photon number regime have a superior performance when compared to schemes using other types of non - classical states , for instance , the  noon \" states @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated the optimality of squeezed states in ideal phase estimation , as well as the fact that the qfi scales quadratically with the mean photon number if squeezed states are employed in place of coherent states ( linear scaling ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of importance to seek other probe states that could lead to more efficient protocols .",
    "we remark that in the above mentioned works , features such as squeezing and entanglement have been considered separately in different protocols .",
    "thus , we may ask ourselves : could we have any advantage if we use continuous - variable entangled states also exhibiting squeezing ?    in this work we investigate the adequacy , for phase estimation purposes , of interpolated quasi - bell squeezed states , which are continuous - variable entangled states having squeezed coherent states @xmath0 as component states . it should be noted that , under more realistic conditions , if one considers external unwanted influences such as noise @xcite or even a  unitary disturbance \" @xcite , the accuracy of the estimation may be considerably degraded . accordingly",
    ", we will analyze the phase estimation using quasi - bell squeezed states also taking into account a linear unitary disturbance in the derivation of the qfi .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the calculations of the qfi and study the quantum phase estimation using quasi - bell squeezed states .",
    "we first consider the ideal case and also investigate the effect of a linear disturbance .",
    "the role of entanglement in the phase estimation is also discussed in that section . in section 3",

    "we are going to consider only the input states @xmath9 .",
    "we would like to remark that the interpolation parameter @xmath5 is intimately related to the entanglement of the state @xmath9 and this will allow us to identify the role of entanglement in the phase estimation process without compromising the other parameters involved .",

    ", we should not interpret the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath33 as having any specific physical meaning ; they are just two auxiliary parameters that will be useful to compare the results of this work with the non - entangled case @xcite .",
    "the energy of the input state depends on the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath33 of the component state @xmath20 as well as on the interpolating parameter @xmath5 . for this reason",
    ", we represent the qfi as a function of the input average photon number @xmath34 [ eq .",
    "( [ nina ] ) ] in mode @xmath14 of the entangled state @xmath9 and as a function of the parameter @xmath33 .",
    "it is not an easy task to algebraically invert eq .",
    "( [ nina ] ) to obtain @xmath31 explicitly as function of @xmath34 , and we do this numerically , adjusting the value of @xmath31 in order to get the desired input photon number @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qfi - zero - eta ] ( _ top _ ) we plot the qfi as a function of the squeezing fraction @xmath33 .",
    "the optimal probe state is the one capable of reconciling the gains due to entanglement without loosing the gains due to squeezing .",
    "we notice that when @xmath35 we have a `` squeezing fraction '' @xmath36 for which the qfi is greater than the one obtained with non - entangled states . however , when @xmath37 , although we have a state that may be maximally entangled when @xmath38 , we notice that we do not have any increase for the qfi .",
    "thus we conclude that the best strategy is to spend all the energy in squeezing the state . to understand this phenomenon , we analyse the parameter @xmath31 that the component state @xmath20 must have in order to let the input photon number be the available value @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qfi - zero - eta](_bottom _ ) ) . because the energy @xmath34 increases for @xmath38",

    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we have verified that if the parameter @xmath5 is negative , the optimal input state is not an entangled state , and the mode @xmath14 of this state corresponds to what has been previously found @xcite , i.e. , the qfi is given by @xmath40    we remind that in the case of phase estimation with single - mode states we have @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath5 increases from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , though , the qfi increases if there is enough energy . in this range of values for the energy ,",
    "increasing @xmath33 past @xmath44 leads to a reduction of entanglement .",
    "this is because the components of the quasi - bell state become two squeezed vacuum states , and the overlap @xmath45 increases @xcite .",
    "for this reason , @xmath46 is not equal to @xmath43 , which reconciles the gains due to entanglement with the gains due to squeezing for the phase estimation . in fig .  [",
    "fig : emaranhamento - sonda - otima ] we plot the entanglement of the optimal probe state for various interpolation parameters @xmath5 .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that even when we take @xmath47 , entanglement is not imposed , because the state is not entangled if @xmath41 , as it happens for @xmath37 . moreover , in the case of a single mode squeezed state ( when there was no additional parameter @xmath5 ) @xmath41 was indeed the optimal value for the  squeezing fraction \" .",
    "this means that the phase estimation with linear unitary disturbance could be upgraded by the use of entangled states .",
    "the qfi is gradually increased when we allow the state to be more and more entangled ( increasing @xmath5 ) , so it seems natural to look for a more direct relation between the entanglement of the quasi - bell states and the resulting qfi . when we found the optimal parameters @xmath33 and @xmath48 for the input state by maximizing the qfi , we removed the dependence of the qfi on those parameters .",
    "we are now able to observe the dependence of the qfi on the interpolation parameter @xmath5 , which fixes the maximal entanglement of the input state .",
    "because both the qfi and the entanglement are monotonic functions of @xmath5 , for @xmath35 , we can represent the qfi directly as a function of the entanglement for this ( positive ) @xmath5 semi - axis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qfi_functionof_e ] we notice that the qfi increases monotonically as the entanglement of the probe state increases , showing that entanglement is a resource for quantum phase estimation even if there is a unitary disturbance in the system .",
    "the qfi is an increasing function of the parameter @xmath49 of the disturbance because there is an energy increase parameterized by @xmath49 during the transformation .",
    "the average photon number in the mode a of the output state may be calculated in the following way :    @xmath50    using again eq .",

    "[ fig : qfi - functionof - nout - entanglement ] the qfi as a function of the average photon number in mode @xmath14 for @xmath57 ( similarly to what is done in @xcite ) . of course for @xmath13 we re - obtain the previous results for single - mode gaussian states @xcite .",
    "we note that the presence of the disturbance @xmath49 affects the phase estimation also when the probe state is entangled , if the total available energy ( input state + transformation ) is taken into account .",
    "however , we observe that the qfi may attain larger values than in the non - entangled case @xcite , showing once more the advantages of using entangled states for quantum phase estimation even in the presence of a unitary disturbance .",
    "finally , we may analyze the feasibility of the adjustment of the parameters that were optimized along this work .",
    "firstly we remark that the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : qfi - functionof - nout - entanglement ] corresponds to the behavior of the left ends ( @xmath57 ) of the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : qfi - functionof - l ] ( _ bottom _ ) , when we consider higher energies . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the value of @xmath46 is well defined , but it may be hard to reach it for a total input photon number larger than @xmath58 .",
    "this is because , in this case , we have @xmath59 and the sensitivity of the qfi upon a very small variation of @xmath33 around @xmath46 is very high .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : qfi - functionof - nout - entanglement ] represents then only a theoretical indication of how entanglement may be useful for phase estimation .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the use of the interpolated quasi - bell states as input probes for quantum phase estimation .",
    "we have compared the qfi in the ideal case with the qfi when a unitary disturbance is included in the hamiltonian which determines the evolution .",
    "we have found that the use of continuous variable entangled states based on coherent squeezed states makes possible to increase the precision for phase estimation , specially when the total average photon number is not negligible ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we have verified that the qfi is an increasing function of the interpolation parameter @xmath5 ( for @xmath35 ) , which is related to the entanglement contained in the optimal probe state .",
    "we have also observed that the larger the unitary disturbance parameter @xmath49 , the larger will be the energy of the output state , which increases the qfi .",
    "however when we consider all the energy spent in the process ( including the energy used in the transformation ) we found that the disturbance actually impairs the phase estimation .",
    "we also highlight that for input states with higher energy , the `` optimal squeezing fraction '' parameter @xmath46 must be finely adjusted in order to maximize the qfi when @xmath11 .",
