    "the high end of the halo mass function is the most observationally accessible . in this regime ,",
    "cluster abundances are most sensitive to changes in the proper distance at low redshift .",
    "by @xmath6 , abundances become more sensitive to the growth function @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity has motivated numerous x - ray and optical searches for the most massive clusters across a range of redshifts .",
    "observations provide constraints on the abundance of clusters as a function of observables such as x - ray luminosity or optical richness .",
    "extracting cosmological constraints from these observations requires a good understanding of the relationship between these observables and the underlying cluster mass .    among the various cluster detection schemes",
    ", optical imaging catalogs enjoyed the earliest successes , targeting the high s / n end of the abundance function across a range of redshifts .",
    "these began with the early photographic plate surveys of abell @xcite and zwicky @xcite and have since moved to digitized plate catalogs @xcite and ccd - imaging catalogs @xcite . during the 1980 s ,",
    "large spectroscopic catalogs were also generated , drawing from a host of redshift surveys including the cfa redshift survey , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and many others ) , the nearby galaxies catalog @xcite , the eso slice project @xcite , the las campanas redshift survey @xcite , the nearby optical galaxy sample @xcite , the southern sky redshift survey @xcite , the 2df redshift survey @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , and deep2 @xcite .    at about the same time , space - based x - ray telescopes became an invaluable tool for cluster science , detecting hundreds of x - ray luminous clusters in flux limited surveys @xcite .",
    "individual clusters have been detected in this way out to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect has been cited as a powerful means for cluster detection @xcite .",
    "imminent ground - based sunyaev - zeldovich surveys promise nearly redshift - independent detections of a range of halos @xcite .    while finding massive clusters has become more routine , returning robust cosmological constraints",
    "has proven challenging . for any method of detecting clusters ,",
    "robust cosmological constraints are impossible without a reliable estimate of the absolute calibration of and scatter in the observable  mass relation .",
    "scatter can be due to both the stochastic nature of the physics that relates the observables to mass , and to noise in the measurements themselves . because the abundance function drops precipitously with increasing mass , any attempted selection of dark matter halos imposed by a cut on an observable in this high - mass regime scatters systems asymmetrically above and below this cut , a selection effect known as eddington bias @xcite . in the exponential tail of the distribution",
    ", the number of objects scattered up across the threshold in the observable considerably exceeds the number scattered down , and depending on the size of the scatter , this difference can be comparable to the sample size itself .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the quality of the cosmological constraints from any measurement of cluster abundances will depend on the amount of scatter between the observable and halo mass , on the dynamic range of masses probed , and on how well the mass  observable relation can be calibrated .",
    "thus interpretation of these abundance measurements typically requires complex modeling strategies @xcite or self - calibration techniques @xcite to calibrate them and to account for the selection biases incurred by the scatter in the mass - observable relation .",
    "in addition , self - calibration techniques may be more challenging than previously expected if halo clustering depends on properties other than mass @xcite .    despite their challenges , optically - selected cluster catalogs offer many advantages over other methods .",
    "optical surveys are generally able to detect individual galaxies at high s / n to high redshift and in wide fields .",
    "this has enabled spectroscopic surveys to identify halos at the group scale .",
    "imaging catalogs can in principle do the same , over a substantially larger redshift range , if they can limit the degrading effects of projection .",
    "by contrast , x - ray surveys are relatively insensitive to projection issues @xcite and can be used to detect intermediate - mass groups .",
    "unfortunately the relatively low x - ray luminosity of groups limits detection to the most luminous or low redshift objects .",
    "in addition to the obvious advantage of more bang for the buck if photometric surveys can be used to identify clusters robustly  indeed , such surveys are often done primarily for other reasons , such as the measurement of the galaxy power spectrum  there are substantial advantages to identifying systems farther down the abundance function .",
    "first , cosmological constraints are improved when one can measure the mass function over a larger dynamic range : e.g. , the _ difference _ in the abundance of low mass to high mass systems can constrain the normalization of the power spectrum with less degeneracy than the pure abundance of the highest mass systems .",
    "second , the effect that scatter has on weakening constraints are somewhat mitigated when one can identify systems farther down the abundance function , where the mass function is shallower .",
    "the other strong advantage of optical surveys over other methods is the vast amount of additional data available on the clusters , that can both contribute to mass calibration and that can inform our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "in addition to measurements of cluster clustering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are possible with other types of selection , the galaxies used to identify the clusters can also be used for weak lensing measurements @xcite , and for velocity measurements if some or all of the galaxies have spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they can also be used to measure the luminosity function and profiles of galaxy clusters @xcite , and the cluster mass - to - light - ratio @xcite , which can improve cosmological constraints when combined with galaxy clustering measurements @xcite .",
    "as we will show , in imaging surveys , cluster catalogs that span a broad range of masses and redshifts are a possibility .",
    "minimizing projection is the primary driver behind modern cluster and group - finding algorithms . in recent years",
    ", imaging - based techniques have matured with the construction of galaxy catalogs from surveys such as the digitized second palomar observatory sky survey ( dposs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the palomar distant cluster survey ( pdcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to name a few .",
    "automated efforts were initiated in photographic plates , beginning with counts - in - cells techniques @xcite and adaptive kernel estimators @xcite . around the same time the powerful matched - filter @xcite and adaptive matched filter @xcite codes were developed for use on the new ccd imaging .",
    "the adaptive kernel method of @xcite was among the first to employ color cuts conducive to cluster galaxy selection in their codes .",
    "the red - sequence method @xcite was the first to explicitly use color selection of red - sequence galaxies as the primary lever arm for cluster detection .",
    "the cut - and - enhance @xcite and the spectroscopic c4 algorithms @xcite generalized this notion of color uniformity to clustering in any color .",
    "the guiding principles usually invoked in the appraisal of these cluster finders are that the algorithm must be automated and objective , should impose minimal constraints on cluster properties , have a well - understood selection function , and should provide physical properties of the clusters , such as redshift , luminosity , and richness @xcite .",
    "the preceding algorithms address these points with varying degrees of success , and primarily concern themselves with the optically - richest systems . since cosmology with clusters of galaxies is an integral component of many current and future surveys , cluster - finding algorithms that exploit the full power of modern imaging surveys will become increasingly important as well .",
    "in addition to uncovering the most massive halos , it is desirable that they should also produce cluster catalogs that extend down the mass function , to measure the mass function over the largest possible dynamic range .",
    "evidence from studies of galaxy environments suggest a means by which to accomplish this .",
    "galaxies in dense environments preferentially exhibit both early - type morphologies @xcite and red colors @xcite .",
    "indeed , confirm that the red fraction in clusters increases with increasing halo mass and luminosity , and decreasing halo - centric radius .",
    "thus , the presence of a nascent red galaxy population in lower mass , lower richness halos , although less evolved than the red galaxy population of massive clusters , provides the opportunity to extend cluster detection to lower mass scales .    in this work ,",
    "we present `` maxbcg '' , an optical cluster - finding algorithm adapted specifically to wide - field , multi - band digital imaging surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "this algorithm takes advantage of observational cornerstones of cluster galaxies : they are typically the brightest galaxies at a given redshift ; their brightest members share very similar colors ; and they are spatially clustered .",
    "as we will show , these properties alone are sufficient to robustly select and center the richest clusters , while the power of the red - sequence takes over at lower richness to select group - sized objects .",
    "combining these factors in an algorithm , and running it on surveys with the size and quality of the sdss imaging enables the generation of immense , high - quality cluster catalogs whose selection function can be quantitatively determined . between @xmath8 , maxbcg can reliably identify objects with @xmath9 red galaxies , and masses of @xmath10 in a volume limited way .",
    "section [ sec : algo ] of this paper contains an outline of the maxbcg algorithm , and the details of its components .",
    "the execution of the algorithm is covered in  [ sec : likelihoods ] , followed by study of the selection function and performance of the algorithm in mock galaxy catalogs in ",
    "[ sec : selection ] . a discussion and summary",
    "conclude the paper . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath11 and @xmath12 . a companion paper , @xcite , presents a catalog of 13,823 clusters identified using this method from sdss data , over the redshift range @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce the maxbcg algorithm , a new cluster detection technique which exploits three primary features of galaxy clusters .",
    "the first is the obvious spatial clustering of galaxies in clusters , which falls off as @xmath13 projected in 2 dimensions ( section 2.3 ) .",
    "the second is that the most luminous cluster galaxies inhabit a tight sequence in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , the so - called `` e / s0 ridgeline '' .",
    "the galaxies in the e / s0 ridgeline have very uniform colors , and are among the reddest , brightest , and rarest galaxies at a given redshift .",
    "because of the strong 4000 break in their rest - frame spectra , their color is tightly correlated with redshift , so that color measurements have the additional advantage that they provide accurate redshift estimates .",
    "the last feature is that there often exists a unique brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) that resides in the e / s0 ridgeline , is typically coincident with the center of the galaxy distribution , and is nearly at rest relative to the halo center .",
    "bcgs in rich clusters usually take the form of giant elliptical galaxies , so large that they are only found at the centers of galaxy clusters .",
    "thus they provide important additional information about cluster locations and redshifts .",
    "these features are folded into a likelihood function which is redshift - dependent .",
    "individual objects in an input photometric galaxy catalog are evaluated at an array of redshifts with this composite function , to assess the likelihood that they are bcgs living in an overdense environment consisting of galaxies with a small dispersion in color .",
    "an outline of algorithm is as follows :    \\1 . using the likelihood function , each object in an input galaxy catalog is tested at an array of redshifts for the likelihood that it is a cluster center .",
    "each object is assigned the redshift which maximizes this likelihood function .",
    "the objects are ranked by these maximum likelihoods .",
    "the object with the highest likelihood in the list becomes the first cluster center .",
    "all other objects within @xmath14 ( the typical @xmath15 on a red galaxy ) , a scaled radius @xmath16 , and lower maximum likelihood are removed from the list of potential centers .",
    "5 , the next object in the list is handled similarly , and the process is continued , flagging other potential cluster centers within that object s neighborhood which have lower likelihoods .",
    "all unflagged objects at the end of this percolation are kept , and are taken as bcgs identifying clusters in the final cluster list .    as a consequence of this method",
    ", each cluster gets a photometric redshift , the redshift which maximizes its likelihood of being a cluster center . during the process ,",
    "the number of galaxies within @xmath17 mpc , within @xmath18 of the e / s0 ridgeline , and brighter than some minimum luminosity , @xmath19 ( see section 2.5 ) , and dimmer than the bcg is recorded as @xmath20 , an initial richness estimate .",
    "a scaled richness estimate , @xmath21 , is also generated .",
    "the only difference from @xmath20 is that instead of using a fixed aperture , it counts objects within @xmath16 of the bcg , where @xmath22 mpc @xcite .    in the following , the components of the likelihood function encoding these properties are outlined and the overall likelihood function is described .",
    "the section concludes with a description of the input galaxy catalog . along the way we justify the choices made in design of the algorithm .",
    "the general strategy for finding clusters in maxbcg is to maximize the likelihood that a galaxy resides at the center of a cluster by varying the redshift .",
    "this is a two - part likelihood function .",
    "one part checks a galaxy for its similarity to a bcg , and the other part measures the match of a galaxy s environment to the e / s0 ridgeline . in what follows",
    ", we build the components of the likelihood : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the bcg and ridgeline likelihoods .",
    "the algorithm proceeds by evaluating this full likelihood function for the whole galaxy density field and labeling peaks in the field .",
    "the ridgeline likelihood is broken up into spatial and color filters , which are folded into a matched - filter likelihood .",
    "each component contains parameters that are driven observationally , such as the width of the e / s0 ridgeline , or theoretically , such as the nfw density @xcite profile .",
    "n - body simulations and studies of galaxy distributions in rich clusters ( e.g. , on early versions of this algortihm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that both the distribution of dark matter around dark matter halos and the distribution of galaxies around cluster centers can be well - modeled by an nfw profile . in three dimensions , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a scale radius , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are dimensionless parameters , and",
    "@xmath30 is the critical density . with @xmath31 ,",
    "@xcite has shown that this can be written as a surface density : @xmath32 with @xmath33    because @xmath34 diverges at small @xmath35 , and because this assumption is shakier at small radii , the profile is truncated at @xmath36 , or @xmath37 kpc ( see below ) .",
    "objects near the center are given large weights , and those far away are strongly down - weighted .",
    "this model allows for a variable scale radius , @xmath38 that could be additionally maximized to provide an optimal size for each cluster .",
    "we choose a fixed @xmath39 kpc in this implementation .",
    "this quantity is normalized to 1 by integrating the area over @xmath40 mpc ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "tests show that varying @xmath38 between 100 kpc and @xmath17 mpc only has a very marginal influence on the overall abundance function or the algorithm selection function . in general , and in accordance with other authors @xcite , we find that the exact parameters of the radial likelihood function have only a minimal effect on the performance . only extremes , such as top - hat spatial filters that have sharp edges ,",
    "strongly influence the performance .",
    "investigations of rich clusters indicate the presence of a universal red - sequence , extending from the nearby coma and virgo clusters @xcite , through intermediate redshifts @xcite , and out to redshifts as high as @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "this population of galaxies dominates the bright end of the cluster luminosity function @xcite and consists of e and s0 galaxies objects with a narrow scatter in color , hence its designation as the `` e / s0 ridgeline '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1 ) . this tight sequence is due to the presence of the uniformly old underlying stellar populations in these galaxies , resulting from passive evolution and minimal star formation . in coma and virgo , the stellar component has most likely been in place for at least 2 gyr @xcite . for a review of the red sequence in galaxy clusters ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the red sequence is not limited to galaxy clusters .",
    "it persists smoothly down to the lower density environments harbored in groups @xcite .",
    "transformation of a field spiral into a red - sequence elliptical has been hypothesized to occur in two steps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : 1 ) mergers between spiral galaxies in low velocity groups create ellipticals @xcite , which in turn 2 ) are stripped of their hot gas through processes such as ram pressure stripping and galaxy harassment , effectively truncating star formation @xcite .",
    "this picture has been supplemented by recent simulations which implicate active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback in truncating star - formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "depending on the state of the evolution of the group and the possible presence of agn , the e / s0 ridgeline may be ill - defined in a given group .",
    "however , the presence of red - sequence galaxies is ubiquitous in higher mass groups , and extends substantially farther down the richness function than any properties that depend on cluster gas properties .",
    "motivated by the location of the 4000   break and the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) cuts outlined by @xcite , we employ cuts in sdss @xmath43 and @xmath44 in our search ( section 3 ) , which depend on the color - redshift relation of the e / s0 ridgeline .",
    "first , we measured the width of the ridgeline using stacked abell clusters at @xmath45 in the sdss spectroscopic survey , and fit a line to the color - magnitude diagrams , as there is a small tilt .",
    "we then projected the distribution along the line .",
    "the resulting color distributions are well - fit by gaussians with widths if 0.05 and 0.06 in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in agreement with a range of studies @xcite ; since the color errors are small ( @xmath46 mag ) for this bright sample ( @xmath47 ) , most of the width is intrinsic to the ridgeline .",
    "this information is folded into @xmath25 for some color @xmath48 using a normalized function @xmath49 , of the following form : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the color of some galaxy being tested , @xmath52 is the predicted e / s0 ridgeline color at some redshift ( see below ) and the width , @xmath53 , is determined according to @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is the error in the measured color of an individual galaxy and @xmath56 is the intrinsic width of the e / s0 ridgeline , 0.05 for @xmath43 and 0.06 for @xmath44 .",
    "the ridgeline width is taken to be constant with both redshift and richness , a reasonable approximation for the redshift range considered here .",
    "it is clear that this function will peak in the field of a rich cluster when the right redshift - color combination is tested , and that the peak will be strong for galaxies with well - measured colors and for clusters with especially tight e / s0 ridgelines .",
    "one feature of this prescription is that the photometric error , @xmath55 , is folded into the cluster detection process .",
    "galaxies with poorer color measurements are able to contribute to ridgelines at a wider range of redshifts , albeit at a suppressed level because of the breadth of @xmath49 .",
    "those with good color measurements have a very narrow , highly peaked @xmath49 , such that they make a very strong contribution to the ridgeline at the right redshift , and a vanishingly small contribution to ridgelines at other nearby redshifts .",
    "the input of photometric errors to cluster detection is somewhat similar to that in @xcite , where the color slices are defined according to the typical photometric error and the intrinisic ridgeline width . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite use photometric error estimates to exclude galaxies from the cluster detection process whose color errors are larger than the expected ridgeline width . @xcite and @xcite do not use the photometric error explicitly in cluster detection .    as noted by @xcite , the fiducial color  redshift model , @xmath52 , does not need to be perfect to find clusters ; clustering in color requires little knowledge of redshift",
    ". however , accurate color  redshift relations are certainly helpful in providing accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "this is a very reasonable demand , as the strong 4000  break feature in red - sequence galaxies makes @xmath43 an effective indicator of redshift .",
    "this feature enables red - sequence algorithms to deliver accurate photometric redshifts without spectra .",
    "the accuracy of the photometric redshifts is borne out in the accompanying maxbcg catalog paper @xcite , where the photometric redshift errors are shown to be @xmath57 for clusters with @xmath21  @xmath58 and with @xmath1 .",
    "for comparison , in the sdss , the method of @xcite also returns photometric redshift errors of @xmath59 over a similar redshift range , while the hybrid - matched filter of @xcite has errors that range from @xmath60 to 0.02 . outside the sdss , the digitized nsc @xcite survey reaches @xmath15 as low as 0.033 , while the rcs @xcite estimate @xmath61 over @xmath62 .    in maxbcg ,",
    "the determination of @xmath52 is driven observationally , by the sdss lrgs @xcite whose colors and redshifts serve as a template .",
    "an advantage of using the lrgs is the fact that they provide observationally - determined colors and redshifts of the early - type galaxies that we expect to be in dense environments .",
    "a drawback is that the standard lrg color  magnitude selection criteria are only valid for @xmath63 , so that lrgs outside this range must be selected by alternate means .",
    "we handle this shortcoming by using a combination of spectroscopic classification ( @xmath64 ) and morphology ( @xmath65 ) @xcite to extract luminous early - type galaxies below @xmath66 from the sdss full spectroscopic sample @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath44 colors of these spectroscopically - identified objects were used to predict the ridgeline colors of @xmath67 clusters . a fiducial version of the cluster finder",
    "was then run , and spectroscopically - identified cluster members were used to create a refined prediction of the color ",
    "redshift relation at @xmath67 .    beyond @xmath66 , where the standard lrg selection is robust , and clusters with multiple member spectra are less common , the lrg colors were used to select the initial cluster galaxies .",
    "their colors were then used to calibrate the color  redshift relation . the resulting piecewise - defined function for determination of the ridgeline @xmath43 color vs. redshift",
    "is shown in figure 2 . a similar relation exists for @xmath44",
    ". the combined @xmath43 and @xmath44 models constructed in this way are at the heart of the ridgeline component of the likelihood function , as well as the photometric redshifts provided by this algorithm .    for comparison ,",
    "the lrg @xmath43 colors are shown in figure 2 , as shown in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the upper and lower short dashed lines are the g - r colors predicted from their pegase simulations for passive ( upper ) and star - forming ( lower ) dotted lines .",
    "the lrg cuts in the sdss are designed to select the brightest @xmath68 red galaxies , which should also be the reddest .",
    "the upper short - dashed line indeed falls on the red end of the cluster galaxy colors at each redshift , and the star - forming model forms a sort of lower bound for the cluster members , so the cluster colors ( and our model ) compare quite well with the lrg sample .      the general framework for developing @xmath25 is identical to that derived by @xcite . the following reviews this process .",
    "the application of this formalism to our filters is valid as long as the assumptions about the gaussian character of the galaxy number counts in a given angular aperture hold .",
    "even when this begins to fail , the efficacy of the red sequence and the fact that the likelihoods are used as a ranking tools (  [ sec : likelihoods ] ) and not as absolute assignments of cluster significance allows us to use this method of identification for relatively low mass groups .",
    "the framework is constructed by first writing down the cluster likelihood : @xmath69 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2 } } \\label{eq : clustlike}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the model for the cluster spatial and color distribution and @xmath71 is a measure of the cluster richness . in this work ,",
    "we take @xmath72 , described in equations ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "this is essentially the contribution of a galaxy with colors @xmath28 , at a physical radius @xmath73 to the likelihood that a test point is in a cluster ridgeline .",
    "the uncertainty , @xmath74 , is poisson since the number counts in the aperture are dominated by background , @xmath75 .",
    "the poisson nature then implies @xmath76 .",
    "we note that the gaussian approximation is assumed in eq .",
    "[ eq : clustlike ] ; since the counts are essentially poisson distributed with a high mean , the gaussian approximation is sufficient .",
    "we have on hand a survey containing galaxies with colors and magnitudes , @xmath28 and @xmath77 , and radial distances @xmath73 from a point of interest .",
    "sitting at some point in the survey , the likelihood is evaluated over the full survey , @xmath78 , such that :    @xmath79 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2 } } + { \\frac{[\\sigma(r / r_s)g_{g - r}g_{r - i}]^2}{\\sigma^2 } } \\right)\\ ] ]    it is apparent in the previous sections that the relevant quantities in the likelihood are all functions of redshift .",
    "the models for the colors and the angular scale of the spatial filter will be set after a redshift is chosen for likelihood evaluation (  [ sec : likelihoods ] ) .",
    "given that @xmath80 , @xcite have shown that maximizing this quantity is nearly the same as maximizing @xmath81    the integral is evaluated by taking the input galaxies to be @xmath82-functions at the radii and magnitudes at which they are observed .",
    "this turns the integral into a sum over all the galaxies in the survey ( eq . [ eq : sumovergals ] ) .",
    "this likelihood equation is then applied in following manner : sit on some galaxy in the survey , a `` potential '' bcg ( section 2.4 ) at a location @xmath83 .",

    "each neighboring galaxy has colors @xmath86 , and projected distance @xmath87 from the potential bcg . compute the product @xmath88 for each neighboring galaxy , and sum : @xmath89g_{g - r}(c_k)g_{r - i}(c_k ) \\label{eq : sumovergals}\\ ] ] the sum @xmath90 consequently embodies the measure of a galaxy s environment , and serves as the ridgeline likelihood .",
    "the second component of the full maxbcg likelihood is @xmath24 , the likelihood that a galaxy is a brightest cluster galaxy . by definition ,",
    "every cluster has a bcg , and it usually takes the form of a luminous early - type galaxy with an @xmath91 surface brightness profile . in some cases",
    "the bcg is a giant `` cd '' galaxy , whose surface brightness is shallower than @xmath91 at large radii , forming the cd - envelope .",
    "their luminosities can reach @xmath92 and the envelopes can extend up to @xmath93 mpc @xcite . particularly in the richest clusters ,",
    "these galaxies comprise a statistically - distinct population @xcite . in measuring the cluster luminosity function ,",
    "@xcite have shown that excluding the bcg markedly improves the fit to a schechter function , and that the bcg luminosity function is approximately gaussian .",
    "the contrast between bcgs member galaxies for poorer systems is less evident .",
    "because of the rarity of clusters , galaxies with bcg properties are themselves rare . using this extra information increases the fidelity of cluster finding . with this likelihood",
    ", we look for individual galaxies with specific properties , and fold this in with a measurement of their environment as specified by the ridgeline likelihood . as in @xcite , who statistically selected bcgs from the sdss lrg sample on the basis of local density and magnitude",
    ", we find that average bcgs make up the bright tip of the red - sequence .",
    "their location in the e / s0 ridgeline is clear in ridgeline plots in figure 1 .    in an effort to study the ubiquity of bcgs , and quantify the characteristics of bcgs , the combined noras - reflex sample described in @xcite",
    "was used to conduct a preliminary visual inspection of the 99 clusters from this combined catalog .",
    "we find that 79/99 ( @xmath94 ) of the clusters in this sample exhibit a single distinct bcg . of the remaining 20 clusters , 15 display 2 bcg - like galaxies , and the remaining 5 have no clear bcg and",
    "are in fact rather optically - poor .",
    "a handful of those with 2 bcg - like galaxies appear as if they are two separate systems undergoing mergers . of the 79 distinct bcgs ,",
    "74 are within @xmath95 in @xmath43 of the ridgeline for the cluster ( @xmath96 ) , and 82 out of the full sample of 99 fell within the ridgeline ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the bcgs in these clusters fall very near the x  ray centers as well .",
    "the median separation of the 79 distinct , visually - identified bcgs , is @xmath98 kpc .",
    "when we add in the clusters with 2 bcgs , the median separation rises to @xmath99 kpc , and the median separation of the full 99 clusters is @xmath100 kpc .",
    "the reader is also referred to @xcite , where it is revealed that in the final cluster catalog , the maxbcg algorithm centers clusters within a median @xmath101 kpc of the x  ray center for this same noras - reflex sample .",
    "taken together , these results demonstrate that classical bcgs fall within the e / s0 ridgeline better than @xmath102 of the time , and that they are quite near the center of the cluster , both of which are encouraging for the task at hand .",
    "nevertheless , the complex nature of the cluster environment creates exceptions to this pattern , and this must be kept in mind as @xmath24 is folded in the maxbcg technique .",
    "@xmath24 is calculated independently of environment .",
    "our goal is to tune maxbcg to find rich clusters , and to center those clusters on the cd - like bcgs .",
    "thus , we need to build a sizable sample of training bcgs , enough to generate a model for the colors and magnitudes of such objects . this observationally - driven model is constructed in two steps .",
    "first , fiducial bcgs are chosen by constructing a template consisting of bright ( @xmath103 ) lrgs and their distribution in @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 space modeled with a linear combination of gaussians fit by expectation maximization algorithm @xcite .",
    "below @xmath66 , the sdss spectroscopic sample was used to select lrgs similar to ridgeline calibration in  2.3 .",
    "the maxbcg cluster finder is then run with these bright lrgs serving as the bcg model for @xmath24 .",
    "then , to construct a refined bcg model , a set of visually identified bcgs from the richest clusters across @xmath106 are chosen from this first run .",
    "we identify 100 bcgs in rich clusters with a characteristic cd envelope , and a single nucleus .",
    "because of their luminosities , most have spectroscopic redshifts in the sdss , so that it is possible to track their colors and magnitudes as function of redshift .",
    "the @xmath73-band magnitudes are plotted as a function of redshift for these bcgs in figure 3 . in this figure , note that we plot the @xmath73-band for comparison to the study of @xcite , but in practice we use the @xmath104-band magnitude ( see  2.5 and the discussion ) .",
    "there is a clear trend of magnitude with spectroscopic redshift .",
    "we fit a quadratic function to this relation , and use it as our model for the trend of bcg magnitude with redshift .",
    "the slope of this magnitude ",
    "redshift relation is nearly identical to that in @xcite , with an offset to brighter magnitudes , as expected .",
    "the bcgs from rich objects in the full maxbcg catalog in @xcite ( greyscale , figure 3 ) display a magnitude ",
    "redshift relation similar in shape to that found by @xcite .",
    "the bcg colors evolve with redshift in essentially the same way as the ridgeline does ( see figure 1 for examples of bcgs in the color ",
    "magnitude relation ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results @xcite , who show that on average , central galaxies properties correlate well with their satellite properties .",
    "the likelihood , @xmath24 , is specified to be @xmath107 as mentioned above , the gaussians @xmath108 are nearly identical to their ridgeline - likelihood counterparts . a crucial component of this likelihood is the smooth cutoff function that ensures that a galaxy s luminosity ( indicated by its @xmath104-band magnitude ) is high enough to be a bcg at a given redshift .",

    "this requirement reflects the wish to measure richnesses and find clusters in a manner that does not dependent on survey flux limits .",
    "we define the cutoff magnitude , @xmath112 , which is designed to consistently select objects above @xmath113 at all redshifts we consider .",

    "the typical early - type spectra red - ward of @xmath120  are relatively flat compared to the break , so this minimizes differences in luminosity estimates that would be due to large spectral features moving into and out of bands .",

    "this works in concert with @xmath24 to select clear bcgs more reliably ; if there are two bright galaxies with otherwise nearly equal likelihoods , the dimmer one will almost always receive the lower ridgeline likelihood , by virtue of the fact that @xmath25 increases with the number of galaxies evaluated .",
    "it also reduces the number of bright foreground galaxies evaluated in the likelihood function or included in the cluster membership .",
    "this cut only depends on the magnitude of the object being tested as a bcg , and not the redshift .",

    ", @xmath102 completeness is reached in all redshift ranges by @xmath150 .",
    "the decreased completeness below this range is partially due to the fact that the artificial clusters were constructed to statistically represent rich abell clusters , and not the poorer group - sized systems we also wish to detect with maxbcg .    to measure the false - positive rate , we simply run maxbcg one the same shuffled galaxy catalogs constructed above . at @xmath143",

    "two clusters at @xmath155 are the largest systems detected in the shuffled catalogs .",
    "the false - positive rate is indeed small .    using traditional methods to evaluate completeness and purity , the maxbcg algorithm fares",
    "very well . however , to more fully assess the catalog s quality , we employ mock galaxy catalogs largely designed for the purpose of understanding maxbcg selection effects , whose galaxy distribution based on the underlying dark matter distribution and tuned to match observed luminosity - dependent and color - dependent galaxy clustering measurements @xcite .",
    "there are two motivations for proceeding in this way .",
    "first , compared to simple monte ",
    "carlo realizations , the mock catalogs are more representative of galaxy clusters in the universe , and will reveal a more realistic picture of the performance of the cluster finder . while any given mock catalog is unlikely to be a perfect representation of the universe , as we do not understand everything about the physics of galaxy formation and galaxy bias , the closer such catalogs can be , the more robust our understanding of the cluster - finder selection effects can be .",
    "these mocks have a strong advantage over previous simplistic methods in that they embed their clusters in a realistic network of filaments and voids , a feature essential for understanding the effects of projection on cluster finding .",
    "secondly is that much of our understanding of large - scale structure is embodied in n - body simulations , and the strength of cosmological constraints comes from understanding the connection of observables with dark matter halos in these simulations .",
    "thus mocks that correctly encode this connection are essential to extract the full power of these data .",
    "ideally , our simulations would directly predict galaxy properties and their distribution from first principles , but we are currently a long way from a complete theory of galaxy formation that can do this robustly .",
    "empirical simulations that connect very realistic galaxy distributions with dark matter halos are the first step towards this eventuality , and allow us to compare observations directly to such simulations .",
    "we establish for the remainder of this work the following definitions : a @xmath156 refers to an object in the mock catalog , consisting of dark matter and constituent galaxies .",
    "a @xmath157 refers to any object output by the maxbcg algorithm , whether it is run on real data or on the mock catalog . as part of this exercise ,",
    "we use richness definitions particular to halos and derived clusters separately . in table 1 , we provide a summary of the various quantities we employ .",
    "the halo - specific measurements include the mass ( @xmath158 ) , an intrinsic `` true '' richness of the halo , as assigned in the mock catalog ( @xmath159 ) , and the richness of red galaxies in these halos , @xmath160 .",
    "this latter quantity is aimed at describing the richness of each halo as it would be seen by maxbcg in an ideal case : given the halo s redshift , the number of galaxies from @xmath159 is computed by creating a color  magnitude box centered on the e / s0 ridgeline colors , @xmath141 wide .",
    "the cluster - specific measurements , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , have already been defined .",
    "maxbcg is run on the mock catalog in an identical way to how it is run on the real data .",
    "we present a naive comparison in figure 11 .",
    "the halo abundance in bins of @xmath160 is compared to the @xmath21 distribution of the derived maxbcg clusters from that simulation . for reference ,",
    "@xmath161 objects have masses of @xmath162 , and @xmath163 objects have masses of @xmath164 in principle , @xmath160 of halos is similar to @xmath21 , in that they use the same color cuts , and have a physical scale associated with them .",
    "the abundances are approximately consistent in their slopes , but there appears to be an overabundance of clusters at all richnesses",
    ". this could be due to the performance of the cluster finder itself , wherein it tends to merge smaller systems along the same line of sight .",
    "it could also possibly stem from small - scale projection effects that would cause maxbcg to overestimate the halo richness , making @xmath21 an overestimate of @xmath160 . in the next section ,",
    "these possibilities as well as others are investigated .      as part of the output of maxbcg",
    ", we include cluster members , which are galaxies within a certain spatial distance of the bcg and inside a color  magnitude box appropriate to the maximum likelihood redshift .",
    "as these are predominantly red - sequence galaxies , a large fraction are physically associated with the cluster , at around the @xmath165 level , as indicated by spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the members are thus good indicators of the cluster s position in physical space , so we use them as such when comparing to the simulations .",
    "the same goes for the mock galaxy catalog : halo galaxy members are good indicators of the halo positions , as they all sit with @xmath16 of the halo .",
    "we thus wish to use the overlap between halo galaxies and cluster galaxies to assert whether or not a halo in the simulation is `` matched '' to a cluster returned by maxbcg . in the same spirit as @xmath160",
    ", we only consider red halo members , i.e. the exact galaxies that make up @xmath166 are considered halo members .    in this exercise ,",
    "we consider runs of maxbcg on three mock galaxy catalog realizations of the same cosmology in the interests of minimizing sensitivity to statistics .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a cluster catalog with objects of @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , as this is the final cut applied to the catalog presented in @xcite .",
    "the halo catalog includes halos of @xmath169 solar masses and redshifts @xmath1 . to aid in the interpretation",
    ", we first note that this mass limit corresponds to an average @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the redshift correspondence between `` matched '' ( see below ) clusters and halos is quite good , but the fact that there is some scatter between the maxbcg photometric redshift and the halo redshift ( figure 12 ) should be accounted for in the interpretation .    to measure the completeness , we ask the question `` for a given halo , which cluster contains the largest fraction of the red halo galaxies ? '' .",
    "call this fraction @xmath172 , and the cluster that satisfies this criteria , the `` best '' match .",
    "we can define a threshold for @xmath172 below which we consider a halo to remain unmatched . for this exercise ,",
    "we choose @xmath172 as follows : first , note that the cluster membership criteria counts bright red galaxies within @xmath16 , and in the simulations , halo richness is also computed inside an @xmath16 value determined from the @xmath173 profile .",
    "when matching , only the bright red halo galaxies inside @xmath16 are considered .",
    "the median @xmath16 of the dark matter halos with @xmath174 is @xmath175 mpc .",
    "however , that used in maxbcg for clusters with 10 or more red galaxies is @xmath176 mpc , so that ratio of the areas is @xmath177 or @xmath178 .",
    "thus , @xmath179 is an appropriate threshold .    in figure 13 , we choose a threshold of @xmath179 , and display contours of completeness across the full redshift and mass range of halos .",
    "evidently , maxbcg exhibits a very high completeness at high mass , which begins to decline at around @xmath180 .",
    "many of these `` missed '' objects are assigned @xmath181 , which excludes them from the richness cut we make here , a manifestation of the mass - richness scatter .",
    "indeed , at @xmath182 , there are only about 5 red galaxies in a typical mock halo .",
    "it is safe to conclude that maxbcg locates clusters with high completeness down to at least @xmath183 , and certainly identifies a large population of even lower mass objects .",
    "thus , our stated completeness is quite conservative ; in particular if completeness were defined without this explicit cut in richness it would nt decline at these masses ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "figure 13 also reveals that the cluster catalog includes halos with @xmath184 , nearly at the edge of the simulation .",
    "although these halos are within the redshift error of maxbcg ( @xmath185,@xcite ) , they introduce a level of contamination to the final cluster catalog .",
    "the same could be said for lower mass halos being misidentified as higher mass halos , but the interpretation is less clear , as the mass - observable scatter is quite large ; the idenification of low mass halos could still be within the limits of the mass - observable scatter without actually being contamination .",
    "the purity is defined here by asking the reverse question : `` for a given cluster , which halo contains the largest fraction of the cluster members ? '' .",
    "this fraction is @xmath186 , and the halo that satisfies this criteria is the `` best '' halo match .",
    "a threshold at @xmath187 is chosen for defining a match , and the purity contours in richness and redshift space are shown in figure 13 . at redshift edges of the catalog ,",
    "the purity declines slightly .",
    "this is due to the fact the halo catalog we match to is truncated at @xmath188 and @xmath123 , the range we are concerned with at present .",
    "thus there are some clusters with photometric redshifts that place them within the redshift bounds of the cluster catalog , but whose associated halos have true redshifts just outside this range .",
    "this is evident in the scatter of the halo - to - cluster redshift correspondence shown in figure 12 .",
    "we can confidently say that over the range of the catalog , the purity is well over @xmath102 .      in the case of completeness",
    ", it is not enough to simply say that all halos above some mass threshold were `` found '' . by the matching executed above , a massive halo with a high @xmath160 could be matched to a cluster with low @xmath189 . while this is considered `` found '' , ideally a halo that was successfully flagged by the cluster finder would be associated with a cluster of a richness that is reflective of the halo s richness . in this sense",
    ", we can take the matching exercise a step further and ask `` how well does the richness of the best matched cluster reflect that of the underlying halo ? ''    in the top panel of figure 14 , halo richnesses and the richness of the best - matched cluster are compared for one of the mock galaxy catalogs . each halo is represented by a cross or a diamond .",
    "halos represented by crosses are those that were the most massive match to each cluster .",
    "halos represented by diamonds are those that were matched with clusters that had already been previously matched by a larger halo .",
    "following @xcite , we call this `` overmerging ''",
    ". there is a large population of halos with well - matched clusters , i.e. , clusters with richnesses indicative of the underlying halo properties .",
    "however , there is a subset of overmerged halos ( diamonds ) with low @xmath160 and high @xmath21 . naively ,",
    "this may be attributed to catastrophic projection effects that have been known to plague optical cluster finding .",
    "this in turn could mean that we have clusters we think are rich , but really are just projections of many random things along a deep line of sight .",
    "but there is another possibility .",
    "our likelihoods will not resolve halos within a few mpc of each other , along the line of sight , particularly large halos with a few smaller neighbors .",
    "thus maxbcg can merge these objects , selecting one large , dominant halo and merging the smaller neighbors .",
    "members from these neighboring halos overlap strongly with the cluster members from the dominant cluster , so all the halos match to the @xmath190 cluster .",
    "this explains the low @xmath160 , high @xmath21 population seen in figure 14 .",
    "the three boxed points at the of the top panel of figure 14 illustrate this merging .",
    "they are three separate halos of masses @xmath191 @xmath192 @xmath193 , @xmath160 of 89 , 62 , and 38 , redshifts at 0.233 , 0.229 , and 0.235 .",
    "the latter two appear as diamonds .",
    "these halos are in fact all within @xmath194 mpc of each other , approximately along the same line - of - sight .",
    "this physical distance is below the resolution we expect to gain from the red sequence .",
    "the cluster that is best matched to all three of these halos has @xmath195 , greater than the sum ( 189 ) of these three halos .",
    "a large portion of the objects in this region of figure 14 are less severe instances of this same type of overmerging . but",
    "the matching algorithm used here generally associates rich clusters with rich halos , so our quoted completeness is dually informative .",
    "these smaller halos ( diamonds ) are evidence that maxbcg is performing as expected , merging smaller , nearby halos with larger ones .",
    "to further elucidate the situation , the question can be turned around : `` how well does the richness of the best matched halo reflect that of the underlying cluster ? '' .",
    "this asks the same question of cluster - to - halo matching for the purity measurements . in the lower panel of figure 14 , for each cluster , we plot cluster @xmath21 and the @xmath160 of the best matched halo .",
    "this selects one best halo for each cluster .",
    "the excess at low @xmath160 and high @xmath21 seen in the top panel vanishes , which shows that indeed those small halos(diamonds in the upper panel ) were not poorly matched , but that they were absorbed into large clusters .",
    "the case described above of extreme overmerging shows up as one point at ( 89,269 ) .",
    "the diamonds that appear on the lower panel are clusters that were matched to a halo which had already been claimed as best match by a richer cluster .",
    "this @xmath196 , in which the halo is broken up by maxbcg , is much less prevalent than overmerging ( this is quantified in the following section ) .",
    "when fragmentation does occur , there is still generally one large halo matched to one large cluster , with a few smaller clusters in the neighborhood as well .",
    "the most interesting case to study here is the two clusters with @xmath197 , and redshifts @xmath198 .",
    "these two correspond to one halo , with a mass @xmath199 , and @xmath200 .",
    "there is one clear dominant cluster here , and two others with much smaller richnesses .",
    "this is a case of fragmentation , but it is not especially problematic because there is still a dominant cluster associated with the halo .",
    "this same dominant cluster shows up in the top panel of figure 14 at ( 163,223 ) .",
    "it is safe to conclude then that we are successfully matching rich clusters and rich halos , and that our completeness and purity measurements are telling us much more than `` did we find all the halos '' and `` is there a halo there or not ? '' by either means , rich halos are associated with rich clusters .",
    "we note that this is encouraging for mass calibration .",
    "the extension of these results to understanding the mass - richness relation is enticing , and is undertaken using observational weak lensing and dynamical measurements in other works @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by applying the insight gained from looking at the richnesses to the abundances seen in figure 11 . in figure 14",
    ", we display best - fit lines to richness relations .",
    "if the offset in the abundances is really due to a disagreement between the maxbcg @xmath21 richness and the intrinsic @xmath201 , and the line is a good fit , then the line should should supply the transformation between the two , using either fit . in the upper panel ,",
    "the the best - fit line has a slope @xmath202 and intercept @xmath203 .",
    "this tells us how we should transform @xmath160 for the halo abundance to @xmath21 .",
    "if it is perfect , it should shift the halo abundance curve onto the maxbcg abundance . in the lower panel ,",
    "the best - fit line has slope is @xmath204 and the intercept @xmath205 , telling us how to transform the @xmath21 in the maxbcg abundance to @xmath160 .",
    "if this transformation is perfect , it should shift the maxbcg abundance into agreement with the halo abundance .",
    "overplotted on figure 11 are resulting abundances under the transformation of @xmath160 to @xmath21 ( upper dotted line and upper panel of figure 14 ) and the reverse transformation ( lower dotted line and lower panel of figure 14 ) .",
    "the latter transformation nearly brings the maxbcg abundance into agreement with the intrinsic halo abundance , while the former transformation brings the halo abundance into agreement with maxbcg only at low richness . from figure 14 ,",
    "the duplication present in the upper panel alerts us to the difficulty in seeking a simple relation between the richnesses , but the relation is more straightforward from the reverse situation in the bottom panel . without further modeling of this relationship",
    ", we can assert now with confidence that the offset in the abundances observed in figure 11 is largely due to differences in the richness measurement .",
    "measurements of the cluster abundance function or of cluster clustering are potentially powerful cosmological tools .",
    "a standard assumption is to assume that each cluster from the cluster catalog can be matched uniquely to one halo .",
    "the extent to which this is true depends on the cluster finder , and the definition of the halo @xcite .",
    "for instance if the cluster finder assigns two clusters to each halo , an inflated abundance function will result , as well as a correlation function with increased amplitude .",
    "a full treatment of this relationship depends on the exact scientific goal one wishes to address .",
    "we explore this question in detail , as it applies to cosmological constraints from the cluster abundance function in @xcite . in this section",
    ", some relevant issues for such modeling are described .    up to this point , we have taken the `` best '' match of halos to clusters and vice - versa to measure the purity and completeness respectively . using these methods ,",
    "it is possible for a halo to have , say , @xmath206 of its members come from one cluster , @xmath207 from another , and the remaining @xmath208 not associated with any cluster . in cases where the fractions become nearly equal , say , @xmath209 , there is no clear one - to - one association .",
    "this was touched upon in 14 , where our matching prescription revealed examples of halos being merged into several clusters , and a few of the opposite , where halos were broken up into two or three clusters .    to evaluate the fragmentation incidence",
    ", we take a halo and look at the top two clusters that contributed members , the `` best '' and the second best .",
    "we create a simple fragmentation diagnostic : @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 are the numbers of members contributed by the best and second best cluster matches .",
    "@xmath213 when @xmath214 and there is no fragmentation , and @xmath215 when the halo was perfectly broken in two .",
    "this distribution is shown as a function of @xmath160 in the top panel of figure 15 . to understand the distribution better , we bin the halos by richness and report the median of @xmath216 in each richness bin ( solid line ) it quickly approaches 0 , indicating that there is a minimal amount of fragmentation .",
    "the fragmented halo at @xmath217 shows up as a point at ( 163,0.2 ) in this panel . out of 112 halos with @xmath218 , 7 have @xmath219 , or 6% . for @xmath220 ,",
    "this rises to 25% .",
    "the exercise is repeated for clusters , considering the top two halo matches .",
    "the overmerging statistic , @xmath221 is shown in figure 15 , lower panel . the median hovers around 0.2 , indicating that there is some over - merging present in the catalog at all richnesses .",
    "it is clear that there is a population of clusters that consist of overmerged halos . for @xmath222 ,",
    "@xmath223 halos have @xmath224 , or 39% .",
    "the number is slightly lower for the full range of @xmath225 , at 37% .",
    "it thus remains true that imaging based - cluster surveys will be subject to overmerging , as colors have difficulty resolving of order 10 mpc line - of - sight distances .",
    "this is another contribution to the apparent overabundance seen in figure 11 .",
    "more generally , rich clusters with large apertures will be particulary subject to overmerging of systems along the line - of - sight .",
    "this is likely true of any imaging survey , and future cosmological analyses using clusters from imaging surveys will require a detailed understanding of the extent to which this influences the final constraints .",
    "thus far , we have presented the basic features of the algorithm one must incorporate into any cosmological analysis .",
    "the matching routines executed herein are designed simply , so that we can understand the output of maxbcg .",
    "however , consideration of the richness estimates and the prevalence of fragmentation and overmerging using the maxbcg algorithm demonstrates that these effects must be modeled in detail to fully understand the selection function and properly model abundances . @xcite",
    "employ a matching algorithm similar in spirit to that presented here , that makes cluster - to - halo associations clearer , and makes the selection function of maxbcg easier to quantify .",
    "figure 15 demonstrates the improvement one can realize in the matching .",
    "we refer to this as `` exclusive '' matching , and point the reader to @xcite for a full description .",
    "note that exclusive matching does substantially better than the `` one - way '' matching used in the current work , and in particular that the slope between the cluster abundance and the halo abundance is now roughly unity .",
    "we refer the reader to this paper for a detailed discussion of how to calibrate the full connection between clusters and halos in a way approprate for modeling cluster abundances .",
    "we have described herein the key components of the maxbcg cluster finder and their origins . the performance of its likelihood functions have been demonstrated in a few case studies of observed galaxy clusters . over the redshift range of @xmath1 ,",
    "its selection function was evaluated as a function of halo mass and cluster richness .",
    "the results of the selection function tests were further supported by the demonstration that the maxbcg cluster  mock halo correspondence behaves as expected : rich clusters typically correspond to rich , massive halos .",
    "these same comparisons proved to be efficient diagnostics of fragmentation and overmerging .",
    "it seems that in addition to the @xmath21 richness measurement being an overestimate of richness ( figures 11 and 14 ) , maxbcg tends to overmerge systems along the line of sight ( figures 14 and 15 ) .",
    "this algorithm differs from other photometric cluster finders in its use of likelihoods .",
    "earlier methods have used a range of methods to compute cluster likelihoods and assign significances @xcite . in these methods ,",
    "cluster candidates have been selected by assessing the global significance of their likelihoods and then choosing some likelihood threshold above which cluster candidates are selected .",
    "these highest significance clusters are then reported in the catalog .    in maxbcg , we set out to push farther down the abundance function by making no such cut .",
    "the likelihood function is used locally to report the highest likelihood objects in some region of sky , and then the likelihoods are used to excise locally less significant objects . at no point",
    "do we enforce a global likelihood cut , so that the likelihood function is permitted to define objects down to very low richness .",
    "although the completeness and purity are decreased in this regime , the average properties of these lower likelihood , lower richness objects are very encouraging .",
    "their stacked velocity profiles @xcite and weak lensing measurements @xcite indicate that they are indeed massive objects whose richnesses are strongly coupled to the underlying mass distribution .",
    "this opens up this possibility of leveraging the larger statistics of this lower mass population in constraining cosmology , if the selection effects can be properly understood .",
    "another fundamental difference in the execution of this algorithm is its reliance on galaxy positions .",
    "we evaluate the likelihood function at the locations of galaxies , and not on pixelized data . in pixelization schemes ,",
    "the data is broken up spatially , and likelihood functions are tested at each pixel .",
    "various means are then used to assess significant peaks in the likelihood function across pixels in the survey , and significant pixels are then tied to clusters .",
    "this method helps to speed up the cluster search , and it also prevents over - identification of substructure , or multiple identifications of the same cluster . at the cost of computational time , we find that using galaxy positions allows us to report cluster positions centered on visually - identified bcgs . by our percolation scheme , we do not suffer from over - identification of substructure , which would manifest itself in our fragmentation measurements .",
    "recall that we measure cluster properties down to @xmath226 at each redshift .",
    "ideally , the @xmath19 cutoffs could be derived empirically from the lrg distribution in the way that the colors were extracted .",
    "this requires a full treatment of the luminosity function of lrgs vs. redshift .",
    "obviously , biases in the model could bias the richness measurements and possibly the likelihood functions .",
    "the two major sources of bias are incorrect @xmath84-corrections and , to a lesser extent , evolution of the luminosity function .",
    "we can take a quick look at the consequences of biases introduced by slight errors in the offset @xmath115 of the @xmath227 cutoff ( see section 2.5 ) .",
    "first , at @xmath228 , we can integrate down the cluster luminosity function @xcite to @xmath229 in the cluster s rest frame .",
    "this gives us a count of the number of galaxies , @xmath230 in the cluster brighter than -20.25 .",
    "now , imagine we place the same cluster at @xmath231 , where the @xmath104-band samples a bluer , and possibly dimmer part of the rest frame spectra of the cluster galaxies .",
    "@xmath232-corrections use a model of the spectra of such galaxies to correct for this systematic offset , but the model may represent this offset with varying degrees of success at different redshifts . assume that the @xmath84-corrections at @xmath231 are too dim by only @xmath233 magnitudes on average . call this error @xmath234 .",
    "we can again integrate down the same luminosity function , this time to @xmath235 , and get a number of cluster galaxies @xmath236 . comparing this value to that of the rest - frame ( @xmath230 )",
    "reveals that the number counts can be @xmath207 higher when the @xmath84-corrected limiting magnitude @xmath19 is @xmath233 too dim .",
    "the fractional errors in the number of cluster galaxies for a given magnitude error , @xmath234 , can be cast in the following form : @xmath237 thus , when @xmath234 varies with redshift , it is clear that the richness estimate and the likelihood function ( see next paragraph ) can have unwanted redshift dependence built in .",
    "if there are indeed biases in @xmath19 , it will certainly affect our richness measurements , but we do nt expect it to bias the cluster finder itself .",
    "first , because the @xmath25 varies slowly with redshift the backgrounds at adjacent redshifts , say @xmath231 and @xmath238 , are very similar .",
    "second , the redshift - color relation is smooth and well - understood so that the color filter component of the likelihood function does not radically change .",
    "last , the ridgeline likelihood function is usually strongly peaked as a function of redshift , so that there is an obvious maximum in redshift space .",
    "again , this is not a problem for rich objects , because the detections are robust .",
    "redshift biases are more likely to be seen in low richness objects , where the detections are not high s / n and the background number counts are not well - approximated as gaussian , and the galaxy population is not as dominated by red - sequence galaxies .",
    "broader spectroscopic samples and realistic mock galaxy catalogs that include more faint galaxies will enable a more systematic study of the effect of background in maxbcg cluster detection .",
    "if there are obvious redshift biases introduced by this method , in particular the model for @xmath19 , they will be borne out in the catalog ( see paper i ) . in particular , for @xmath1 , the number of objects should increase like the volume enclosed . in the accompanying paper @xcite we demonstrate that this is approximately the case , and the catalog is volume - limited to z = 0.3 .",
    "there are notable exceptions to our model for the bcg colors .",
    "a well - known population of so - called cooling - flow clusters contain bcgs where gas is in the process of cooling and forming stars , which creates a significantly bluer bcg .",
    "the presence of emission lines in the bcg spectrum provides evidence for a cooling flow .",
    "a1835 is a well - known example ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while we successfully find such clusters , we do not pick the brightest cluster galaxy as the center because its @xmath239 is significantly bluer than the other red - sequence cluster galaxies , which all hover around @xmath240 . in the bcs x - ray cluster catalog @xcite , @xmath241 of bcgs show some sort of emission lines ( crawford et al . ,",
    "the extent to which emissions lines are prevalent in bcgs living in the cluster population as a whole , and the impact they have on the bcg colors , are questions we can begin to address with maxbcg - selected catalogs .",
    "the study of @xcite , which selects low - redshift groups from spectroscopy without reference to color , hints that bcg colors different from those of the cluster population are the exception rather than the norm .",
    "the matched - filter technique applied here is built around the colors of the e / s0 ridgeline and the nfw distribution expected in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the idea is that it should faithfully describe the average properties of galaxy clusters .",
    "certainly , it will discriminate against objects that do nt fit this model , which is more likely to be true at lower mass and richness , and potentially at higher redshift .",
    "we can only quantify this in so far as the mock catalogs are a realistic representation of the cluster and background populations .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that any cluster finder that operates on photometric data will have to make some assumptions about the galaxy populations and their distributions , and it is thus worth making these assumptions as easy to understand and as close to reality as possible .",
    "a final note is that the cluster finder is requires an assumption about the cosmological dependence of the angular diameter distance and the cluster luminosity function used at various stages of the algorithm . given a large enough sample with redshifts , the luminosity function could be determined observationally , but for large changes in cosmology , it is less clear what to do about the angular diameter distance .",
    "the sensitivity of both of these to cosmology is currently under investigation .",
    "as the redshift of an object increases , so does its photometric error .",
    "one would like for the photometric errors to be much less than the intrinsic ridgeline width .",
    "as the errors get bigger , we allow galaxies to be tested as members in more clusters .",
    "this can potentially affect the richness by preferentially inflating richnesses at high redshift , where the color errors are larger .",
    "the cluster catalog presented in @xcite is approximately volume - limited in all richness bins , which suggests that this effect is not too severe . however ,",
    "a more well - understood richness measurement comes at the price of the information lost by discarding galaxies with large errors .",
    "appropriately dealing with photometric errors is currently an issue of interest .",
    "the sdss is a goldmine of cluster data , and it provides an important testing ground for algorithms which will generate the cluster catalogs important to cosmological constraints in future surveys .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to a redshift range where the clusters are well - measured , and most of the redshift and color information is contained in one band .",
    "the selection is quite uniform across all redshifts , but this may change when the search encompasses @xmath242 , as the 4000   break migrates in the @xmath73-band , and @xmath44 contains more information .",
    "future surveys will aim to find clusters uniformly across a broad range of redshifts , spanning many filters .",
    "the likelihoods that embody these color models must weight the different colors fairly , and smoothly handle transitions from one band to another .",
    "the sdss is deep enough that the same methods provide a means to select clusters out to at least @xmath243 , and still see the brightest members . toward this redshift ,",
    "the flux - limit of the survey becomes an issue in fairly measuring richnesses and evaluating likelihood at all redshifts .",
    "the results presented here and in @xcite indicate that maxbcg recovers galaxy clusters with purity and completeness levels of @xmath102 for @xmath244 and @xmath167 .",
    "x  ray selected clusters of similar sky and redshift coverage such as the brightest cluster sample ( bcs * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the northern rosat all - sky ( noras * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey are complete at the @xmath245 level above a given flux limit which will naturally impose a selection effect on the resulting cluster sample that is strongly dependent on redshift .",
    "redshift - dependent effects in maxbcg arise only through biases in @xmath19 over @xmath106 . @xcite",
    "reach @xmath246 in purity , as determined through optical follow - up of x  ray selected clusters .",
    "the purity of x  ray samples is altered by unresolved active - galactic nuclei or stellar contamination , while the purity of optical samples can be compromised by projection .    aside from the completeness and purity of the sample , understanding the mass distribution of the cluster sample is of utmost importance . from the preceding analysis ,",
    "it is clear that projection plays a role in both richness estimation and in overmerging .",
    "these can both bias the estimate of the mean mass at fixed richness , and the estimate of the scatter .",
    "the same can be said of mass estimates in x  ray and sz surveys : point - source contamination , mergers , and other gasdynamical processes contribute to the overall x  ray signal .",
    "no technique is perfect , but for given cluster sample , the extent to which contamination of the observables can be understood will strongly affect the resulting cosomological parameter constraints .",
    "the maxbcg algorithm represents a significant step forward in large galaxy survey cluster detection .",
    "much is known about the properties of cluster galaxies , and the availability of immense , rich , imaging catalogs allows us to begin leveraging this knowledge to detect cleaner and more robust cluster samples and to provide new cosmological information . since optical surveys in the near future intend to pursue cluster cosmology to varying degrees , the advances presented here are timely .",
    "we summarize them as follows :    * maxbcg pushes beyond the high end of the abundance function , down to group - sized halos , where there is additional cosmological information .",
    "the purity and completeness across this broad range are above @xmath102 for @xmath247 and @xmath248 , respectively , across @xmath249 .",
    "systems below this mass range are quite accessible as well , depending on where one draws the richness cut . * in addition to spatial clustering of red - sequence galaxies , we add in information about brightest cluster galaxies and multiple colors to refine the search . *",
    "the likelihoods are evaluated at individual galaxies , as opposed to pixelizing the sky . *",
    "the selection function of the algorithm is explored in detail with mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "since the mock catalogs contain a wealth of observationally - motivated information that is coupled to the underlying mass , we are able to undertake an unprecedented study of the performance of the algorithm on individual halos to gain a deeper perspective on the halo selection . *",
    "the mock catalog provides an initial demonstration of the richness  mass mapping ; richer systems are preferentially associated with more massive halos .",
    "* we confirm the expectation that on @xmath250 mpc scales , maxbcg tends to overmerge systems projected along the line - of - sight , an effect that will have to be modeled .",
    "fragmentation is not found to be significant . *",
    "we open the discussion of difficulties that will be encountered in future multi - band , wide - angle , high - redshift cluster surveys . among these are uniformity of the richness measurements , challenges in using multiple colors , photometric errors , and quantification of the selection function .    in an accompanying paper @xcite and others soon to follow , maxbcg is further assessed with @xmath251 deg@xmath252 of sdss imaging data . in this test on real data ,",
    "the scaling of cluster richness with velocity dispersion is demonstrated , as are the quality of photometric redshifts , the incidence of projection , the uniformity of richness measurements and the agreement between these optical clusters and earlier x - ray selected catalogs .",
    "the maxbcg method provides a different approach to optical cluster selection with a number of useful features .",
    "the experience gained in using it on sdss data will provide important guidance in planning and executing future surveys , such as those planned to study dark energy , including the dark energy survey @xcite , the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system @xcite , the supernovae / acceleration probe @xcite , and the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite .",
