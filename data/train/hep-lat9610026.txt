    "an estimate of the systematic error due to the choice of interval is made by calculating the variance of the results from using all `` reasonable '' time intervals around our favorite one .",
    "a major problem with simulations that include static quarks is that the signal - to - noise ratio decreases very quickly with time  @xcite ; therefore , the operator which creates the @xmath11-meson must project onto the ground state at very early times  before the signal is lost in the noise .",
    "experience with the calculation of the @xmath10 decay constant in the static theory has shown that reliable results can be obtained only if the @xmath11-meson operator is smeared with a very accurate `` wave function , '' which can be obtained from a variational calculation on the lattice .",
    "we use the same smearing function as was used in our calculation of @xmath10 in the static approximation .",

    "if , instead , the same smearing function is used at the sink , with a local ( delta - function ) source , then it will still effectively remove excited - state contamination . yet , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ sl_effmass ] , this fact is obscured by much larger statistical fluctuations .",
    "( since the spatial points are summed over at the sink to project out zero momentum regardless of which smearing function is used , smearing at the sink provides only marginal improvement in the signal and increases noise . in contrast , smearing at the source greatly enhances the signal and decreases the noise . for the local source the static quark",
    "is restricted to the spatial origin , and thus the statistics are poorer  @xcite . )    we note that once an `` optimal '' smearing source has been obtained from the two - point function using a variational technique , it can be used directly in other calculations .",
    "the three - point function does not need to be formulated as a variational problem , although ground - state dominance should still be monitored using the mass splitting between the excited and ground states .",
    "the static quark never evolves in space from the origin because the four - fermion operator is at the spacetime origin .",
    "the @xmath11-meson operator is constructed by smearing the light quark relative to the heavy quark  ( eq .  ( [ eq : two - point ] ) ) . fig .",
    "[ smear ] shows a schematic of the quark flow resulting from the wick contraction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : three - pt ] ) .",
    "the resulting two - point correlators are smeared - sink  local - source ( sl ) correlators , which are much more noisy than local - smeared ( ls ) correlators ( as argued above ) even though in the infinite - statistics limit they are equal .",
    "since three - point functions are , in general , noisier than two - point functions , the `` effective - mass '' plots for these are even noisier than that for the sl two - point function ; it would be hopeless to get a precise result for a static - light - meson matrix element without using a prohibitively large number of configurations .",
    "but fortunately , because the @xmath0 parameter is a _ ratio _ of matrix elements ( eq .  ( [ eq : bnumerdef ] ) ) , the noise is reduced due to the cancelation of correlated fluctuations between the numerator and denominator .",
    "it has been argued that the product @xmath41 and perturbative corrections to it should be calculated directly since it , rather than @xmath0 , is the phenomenologically - important quantity .",
    "but there are several compelling reasons for calculating @xmath10 and @xmath0 separately .",
    "firstly , although the calculation of @xmath0 , as for @xmath41 , is intrinsically more involved than is that of @xmath10 ( both analytically , in the determination of perturbative corrections , and computationally ) , the numerical value of @xmath0 is more stable than is the value of either @xmath41 or @xmath10 .",
    "certainly , @xmath10 is a very important physical quantity in its own right ; it should be and is calculated separately . for this , one need only calculate a two - point function .",
    "however , the statistical fluctuations for @xmath10 are quite large ; without the use of a reliable smearing function obtained variationally , excited - state contamination can be substantial and can mislead interpretation .",
    "( this may explain the scatter in the world summary of lattice calculations of @xmath10  @xcite . ) also , since its lattice - spacing dependence is rather large , especially when using the static approximation , its continuum extrapolation is delicate and prone to large systematic errors .",
    "much computing effort is required to evaluate this simple quantity .",
    "however , @xmath0 ( or @xmath9 ) requires the calculation of a three - point , in addition to a two - point , correlation function . since it is more involved , it is usually determined in a secondary calculation after the primary calculation of @xmath10 and so fewer groups are likely to calculate it . yet , as borne out by our data , since @xmath0 can be extracted from a ratio of three- to two - point functions which are strongly correlated , a quite precise value can be obtained , with an optimal choice of smearing function , from relatively few configurations .",
    "the calculational overhead ( both computational and analytical ) is large compared to the computational expense .",
    "thus a handful of groups can fix precisely the value of @xmath0 once and for all , leaving for the wider community the task of applying improvements in algorithms and computers to the simpler @xmath10 . in the future , @xmath0 ( in contrast to @xmath10 and @xmath41 ) need not be recalculated with every generation of improvements .",
    "secondly , just as the numerical value of @xmath0 is stable because of cancelations of correlated fluctuations in numerator and denominator , we argue that so too are its perturbative corrections when linearized as is demonstrated in sections  [ sec : permat ] and  [ sec : syserr ] .",
    "the perturbatively - calculated coefficients for @xmath0 are likely more reliable than those for the product @xmath41 .",
    "likewise , these are less likely to need updating with the next generation of improvements in analytic methods .",
    "thirdly , it seems as though vsa is a surprisingly good approximation for the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "this is an important qualitative statement , of use to model builders , which should not be obscured by poor - statistics attempts to calculate the product @xmath9 .",
    "the simulations were carried out on a @xmath42 lattice , calculated on 32 gauge configurations , at @xmath3 .",
    "( this number of configurations is more than adequate for a precise estimate of the @xmath0 parameter with small statistical error since an efficient smearing function is used .",

    "( an ultra - conservative gauge - fixing convergence criterion was used such that @xmath43 was decreased to less than @xmath44 its unfixed value . )",

    "our result also contains an unknown systematic error due to quenching .",
    "quenched chiral perturbation theory predicts the effects of quenching to be small for @xmath0  @xcite ; this conclusion was confirmed by bernard and soni  @xcite who calculated @xmath0 in both quenched and dynamical simulations . in soni s review  @xcite of the lattice calculation of weak matrix elements at the _ lattice  95 _ conference , he quotes a value of @xmath135 ( 90% confidence ) as his best estimate of the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "our result , @xmath136 , is consistent with this value and with the vacuum - saturation - approximation value , @xmath103 .",
    "this work is supported in part by the u.s .",
    "department of energy under grant numbers de - fg05 - 84er40154 and de - fc02 - 91er75661 , and by the university of kentucky center for computational sciences .",
    "the computations were carried out at nersc .",
    "in the analysis of @xmath123**@xmath124 mixing experiments the value of @xmath137 is required . here",
    "we discuss the linearization options for combining @xmath138 and @xmath139 from a variety of linearizations of these quantities .",
    "if a not - linearized @xmath0 is multiplied with a not - linearized @xmath140 , then the only order-@xmath118 effects which remain are due specifically to not linearizing the numerator of @xmath28 .",
    "we estimate this effect to be on the order of 10% .",
    "if one multiplies a partially - linearized @xmath0 with a linearized @xmath139 , lin@xmath141 , then there should be no order-@xmath118 effects due to the product .",
    "however , if one mixes a linearized with a not - linearized @xmath0 and @xmath139 , then there can be terms of almost 20% .",
    "although the difference between @xmath142 and lin@xmath143 is smaller than 5% , the difference between lin@xmath141 and lin@xmath144 is just over 15% .",
    "the practical drawback of using a @xmath0 which is not linearized or is partially linearized is that there are order-@xmath118 terms present which may or may not cancel when the @xmath0 is combined with an @xmath139 .",
    "the practical drawback to using the fully - linearized @xmath0 is linearizing the product @xmath145 .",
    "this is easily remedied .",
    "the fully - linearized @xmath28 , @xmath146 , essentially has the form @xmath147 where the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 can be included by adjusting the values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 appropriately .",
    "when this is combined with the square of the linearized @xmath16 , @xmath150 it would be convenient to get a linearized result with no order-@xmath118 terms : @xmath151 since @xmath152 this is straightforward to accomplish .",
    "the product of @xmath146 with the linearized square of @xmath153 gives eq .",
    "( [ eq : linearized ] ) with no order-@xmath118 terms due to coefficient multiplication . our @xmath154 value can be read from the first row of table  [ tb : bparam ] .",
    "while the product of the partially - linearized @xmath0 with the linearized @xmath139 also does not have any order-@xmath118 terms due to coefficient multiplication , the partially - linearized @xmath0 by itself has order-@xmath118 terms which are on the order of 18% ( see tables  [ t : linear ] and  [ tb : bours ] ) .",
    "the advantage of our method is that all three quantities @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 have no order-@xmath118 terms due to coefficient multiplication , and that @xmath155 is stable against the inclusion of tadpole improvement and the choice of wave - function normalization .",
