    "the possibility of a higgs boson decaying into a pair of light @xmath0-odd scalars was considered in ref . @xcite .",
    "although it is very unlikely that this particle can be accommodated in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , in the light of the restrictions imposed by the current low - energy data on the parameters of this model , a very light @xmath0-odd scalar @xmath9 can still arise in some other extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , such as the minimal composite higgs model @xcite , or the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model @xcite .",
    "therefore , the existence of a very light @xmath0-odd scalar not only proves new physics but also casts the most commonly studied mssm in doubt .",
    "furthermore , studying the couplings of the light @xmath0-odd scalar to the sm fermions may help discriminating models of electroweak symmetry breaking  either a weakly interacting model ( e.g. , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ) or a strongly interacting model ( e.g. , the minimal composite higgs model ) .",
    "apart from the above implications arising from the existence of a very light @xmath0-odd scalar , our main interest in studying this particle stems from the fact that its phenomenology is indeed rather exciting : an interesting aspect of a light @xmath9 is that if its mass @xmath10 is less than twice that of the muon @xmath11 , i.e. less than about 0.2gev , it can only decay into a pair of electrons ( @xmath12 ) or photons ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "hence , the decay branching ratio br(@xmath13 ) can be sizable .",
    "consequently , @xmath9 can behave like a fermiophobic @xmath0-odd scalar and predominantly decay into a photon pair , which would register in detectors of high energy collider experiments as a single photon signature when the momentum of @xmath9 is much larger than its mass @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite we performed an extensive analysis within the framework of the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) and found that a very light @xmath0-odd scalar can still be compatible with precision data , such as the @xmath1 parameter , br(@xmath2 ) , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , br(@xmath5 ) , and the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we considered different values for @xmath15 and found the constraints imposed on the remaining parameters of the model , which we summarize in table [ allconstraints ] , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) stands for the heavy ( light ) @xmath0-even scalar and @xmath18 for the charged scalar .",
    "as for the soft breaking term @xmath19 , it is not involved in any of the above observables , so they can not be used to constrain it .",
    "since @xmath19 has no relevance for the present discussion ( the purpose of this work is to update the bounds derived from the changes in the status of the theoretical value of the muon anomaly ) , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite , where lep-2 data were used to set bounds on this parameter . in obtaining the bounds shown in table [ allconstraints ] we have used the lower value of 110 gev for @xmath17 .",
    "we recall that the lep-2 direct search bound requires @xmath20gev at the 95%c.l .",
    ". however , in the presence of new physics such a bound can be substantially relaxed . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reason why the lep-2 bound ( @xmath21 gev ) does not apply in our model is because this bound is based on the sm specific value of br@xmath22 @xcite . in the thdm , the new @xmath23 decay mode can significantly reduce the @xmath24 branching ratio .",
    "this was clearly illustrated in the fig .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "@xcite for some allowed parameter space of the model . in any case , the new decay channel ( @xmath23 ) registers as a di - photon signature ( @xmath25 ) for which lep-2 has already set a lower bound . by taking both the @xmath26 and @xmath27 decay modes into consideration , a lower bound for @xmath28 gev",
    "can be established in our light @xmath9 scenario @xcite .    at this point",
    "we would like to emphasize that , given the recent measurements of @xmath14 at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) @xcite , the bounds on new physics effects imposed by the muon @xmath7 data depend largely on the theoretical value predicted by the sm for the nonperturbative hadronic contribution to @xmath14 . in our analysis @xcite , we followed a conservative approach and considered various predictions for the hadronic correction @xmath29 @xcite , which in fact has been the source of debate recently @xcite .",
    "for instance , the bounds shown in table [ allconstraints ] were obtained from the calculation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was the one allowing the largest parameter space .",
    "finally , we note that while a light @xmath0-odd scalar in thdm is still compatible with all the precision data , it has been shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that a light @xmath0-odd scalar in the mssm will violate the constraint derived from the @xmath30 coupling .",
    "this is because in the mssm , the masses of the five higgs bosons are related by the mass relations required by supersymmetry .",
    "hence , with a light @xmath0-odd scalar , the mass of the other higgs bosons can not be arbitrary large , and it is difficult to yield the decoupling limit when calculating low energy observables .      during the review process of this manuscript , the muon @xmath7 collaboration announced a new result based on data collected in the year 2000 @xcite , in which the experimental uncertainty has been reduced to one half that of the previous measurement while the central value of @xmath31 remains about the same .",

    "[ gm2tbma ] to [ gm2tbma - one-2 ] in this paper to figs .",
    "[ newgm2tbma ] to [ newgm2tbma - one-2 ] .",
    "the new data suggests that a very light @xmath0-odd scalar is not allowed in the type - i or type - ii thdm based on the sm calculation done by dh @xcite and ty @xcite . however , based on the n @xcite and j @xcite calculations , a very light @xmath0-odd scalar is still possible though the allowed parameter space of the thdm has been tightly constrained .",
