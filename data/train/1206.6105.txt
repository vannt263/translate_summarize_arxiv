    "exoplanetary science has been full of surprises .",
    "one of the biggest surprises emerged at the dawn of this field : the existence of `` hot jupiters '' having orbital distances much smaller than an astronomical unit ( au ) .",
    "it is thought that giant planets can only form at distances of several au from their host stars , where the environment is cooler and solid particles are more abundant , facilitating the growth of rocky cores that can then attract gaseous envelopes from the protoplanetary disk .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed which might transport giant planets from their presumed birthplaces inward to where we find them . among the differences between the proposed mechanisms",
    "is that some of them would alter the planet s orbital orientation and thereby change the relative orientation between the stellar and orbital spin @xcite , while others would preserve the relative orientation @xcite , or even reduce any primordial misalignment @xcite .",
    "for this reason , measuring the stellar obliquity  the angle between stellar and orbital axes  has attracted attention as a possible means of distinguishing between different theories for the origin of hot jupiters .",
    "the stellar obliquity is an elusive parameter because the stellar surface needs to be at least partially resolved by the observer .",
    "if the system exhibits eclipses or transits , then it is possible to detect anomalies in the spectral absorption lines of the eclipsed star , which have their origin in the partial blockage of the rotating photosphere .",
    "the precise manifestation of the rotation anomaly depends on the angle between the projections of the stellar rotation axis and orbital axis of the occulting companion .",
    "credit for the first definitive measurements has been apportioned to @xcite and @xcite , after whom the effect is now named . @xcite",
    "were the first to measure the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect for a planet - hosting star , finding a low obliquity .",
    "since then many systems have been studied , including those with misaligned stars @xcite , retrograde orbits @xcite , a hot neptune @xcite and even a circumbinary planet @xcite .    @xcite found a possible pattern in the hot - jupiter data , namely , host stars hotter than @xmath0  k tend to have high obliquities , while cooler stars have low obliquities .",
    "@xcite , using a different method , also found a preponderance of high obliquities among hot stars .",
    "@xcite speculated that this pattern was due to tidal interactions .",
    "specifically , it was hypothesized that hot jupiters are transported inward by processes that perturb orbital inclinations and lead to a very broad range of obliquities .",
    "cool stars ultimately come into alignment with the orbits because they have higher rates of tidal dissipation , due to their thick convective envelopes .",
    "hot stars , in contrast , lack thick convective envelopes and are unable to reorient completely on gyr timescales .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , then not only should further measurements be consistent with the hot / cool pattern , but also the degree of alignment should be found to correlate with the orbital period and planet - to - star mass ratio , parameters which also strongly affect the rate of tidal dissipation . since the study by @xcite the number of systems with rm measurements has nearly doubled . here",
    "we present the results of an additional 14 observations , as well as a critical review of other published measurements ( including thorough re - analyses in three cases ) .",
    "we can now attempt a comparison between the measured obliquities and the theoretical distribution of obliquities that one would expect if tides were an important factor .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite , who recently performed a comparison with a similar motivation , without the benefit of the new rm measurements presented here , but using more sophisticated theoretical models and drawing qualitatively similar conclusions .",
    "this paper has two main parts .",
    "the first part is observational .",
    "we describe our new observations of the rm effect ( section  [ sec : obs ] ) , our analysis method ( section  [ sec : analysis ] ) , and the details of individual systems analyzed here ( section  [ sec : systems ] ) . the second part ( section  [ sec : discussion ] ) considers the distribution of obliquities , seeks evidence for the expected signatures of tidal effects , and considers the implications for the origin of hot jupiters . we summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the 14 new observations presented in this paper were conducted with the kecki telescope and its high resolution spectrograph ( hires ; @xcite ) , for northern objects , and with the magellan  ii ( clay ) 6.5 m telescope and the planet finder spectrograph ( pfs ; @xcite ) for southern objects .",
    "table [ tab : log ] is a log of the observations . to derive the relative rvs we compared the spectra observed through the iodine cell with the stellar template spectrum multiplied by an iodine template spectrum .",
    "the velocity shift of the stellar template as well as the parameters of the point - spread function ( psf ) of the spectrograph are free parameters in this comparison .",
    "the velocity shift of the template that gives the best fit to an observed spectrum represents the measured relative rv for that observation .",
    "in particular we used codes based on that of @xcite .",
    "the rvs used in this paper for all system are presented in the table  [ tab : rvs ] .",

    "in the following sections we describe our strategy to obtain projected obliquities from the observed radial velocities ( rvs ) .",
    "our goal was to perform a relatively simple and homogeneous analysis and thereby facilitate comparisons between systems in the sample .",
    "for some systems for which we obtained new data , rm measurements have already been published by other authors . in order to obtain independent measurements and compare the results , in most cases we did not include the previous data in our analysis .",
    "observing the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect allows one to measure the projected angle between the orbital and stellar spins ( @xmath1 ) and the projected stellar rotation speed ( @xmath2 ) . here",
    "@xmath3 indicates the stellar rotation speed and @xmath4 the inclination of the stellar spin axis towards the observer .",
    "observing the rm effect provides information on the transit geometry because the distortion of the stellar absorption line  specifically its net redshift or blueshift  depends on the rv of the hidden portion of the stellar photosphere .",
    "for example if the obliquity were low , then the planet would begin the transit on the approaching half of the photosphere .",
    "the blockage causes the absorption lines to appear slightly redshifted . during the second half of the transit",
    ", the reverse would be true : the anomalous rv would be a blueshift .",
    "in contrast , if the planet s trajectory were entirely over the redshifted half of the star , then the rm effect would be a blueshift throughout the transit . for a retrograde configuration",
    ", the rm effect would first lead to a blueshift and then a redshift .    in sections",
    "[ sec : broaden][sec : rv_var ] we discuss some specific effects which influence the rm signal , and how we included these in our modeling .",
    "section  [ sec : quantitative ] gives the details of our quantitative model of the rm effect , and the prior information about each system that is used in the analysis .",
    "in addition to stellar rotation , microturbulence and macroturbulence will affect stellar absorption lines and should be considered in the description of the rm effect .",
    "microturbulence is well described by a convolution of the rotationally - broadened line with a gaussian function .",
    "describing macroturbulence is more complex , as it depends on the angle between the line of sight and the local surface normal . near the center of the stellar disk ,",
    "the doppler shifts are produced by vertical ( `` radial '' ) motions , while near the limb , the doppler shifts are produced by motions along the stellar surface ( `` tangential '' motions ) .",
    "the net effect is obtained by spatial integration over the visible hemisphere .",
    "@xcite provided a semi - analytic description of this effect , which we used in our model . the macroturbulent field is parameterized by @xmath5 , the average value of the radial and tangential velocities ( assumed to be equal ) .",
    "what value of @xmath5 should be used to model the rm effect for a given system ?",
    "measuring macroturbulence from the line profile is challenging , as its measurement is correlated with the measurement of @xmath2 . in principle the rm effect itself could be used to measure macroturbulence . however for most of the systems analyzed here the data sets are not precise enough to allow @xmath5 to be a free parameter .",
    "if the macroturbulence can not be determined by the rm effect , one might think its value also does not matter for the analysis .",
    "however , as described below , we used prior information on @xmath2 as a constraint on our model , and this information can only be properly incorporated if macroturbulence is taken into account .",
    "we therefore made use of the relation given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.4 ) , @xmath6 where @xmath5 is in kms@xmath7 and @xmath8 in thousands of kelvin .",
    "@xcite gives an uncertainty of @xmath9  kms@xmath7 for this relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt a more conservative uncertainty estimate of @xmath10  kms@xmath7 .",
    "we decided to use the relationship by @xcite for macroturbulence instead of the relationship by @xcite , because the latter authors derived the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath5 for f stars by extrapolation from later spectral types , while @xcite obtained macroturbulence values for hotter stars directly .",
    "many of the stars in our sample have a @xmath8 greater then @xmath11  k.    additional contributions to the linewidth come from collisional broadening , and zeeman splitting , which are small compared to the effects described above .",
    "we account for them , at least approximately , by convolving the disk - integrated line profiles with a lorentzian function of width @xmath12  kms@xmath7 .",

    "the cb is strongest in light received from the center of the disk , and weaker near the stellar limb .",
    "disk integration leads to an overall doppler shift and an asymmetry in the stellar absorption lines .",
    "the overall doppler shift is of order 1  km  s@xmath7 , but this is unimportant for our purposes , as we are only interested in relative rvs .",
    "however , the motion of the transiting planet will cause time variations in the net cb of the exposed surface of the star .",
    "the time - varying component of the cb effect is of order 1  m  s@xmath7 for transits of late - type stars ( figure  [ fig : show_lines ] ) .",
    "this is a small effect but for completeness it was included in our model .",
    "to describe the effect of the cb , we used a numerical model based on work by @xcite . for the stars in our sample with @xmath14",
    "k we assumed the net convective blueshift to be similar to that of the sun : an effective radial velocity of the photosphere of @xmath15  ms@xmath7 .",
    "for hotter stars we assumed an effective radial velocity of @xmath16  ms@xmath7 .",
    "the single exception to this rule was gl436 , which is much cooler than the other stars ( @xmath17  k ) .",
    "for this system we assumed a smaller blueshift of @xmath18  ms@xmath7 . in principle",
    "one could estimate the overall cb for each system based on the observed line bisectors , but we did not pursue this approach because our first - order analysis revealed that the cb effect is relatively unimportant .      for this study we neglected the possible influence of differential surface rotation on the rm effect .",
    "@xcite concluded that modeling differential rotation is justified only if the transit chord spans a wide range of stellar latitudes , the rm effect is detected with a very high signal - to - noise ratio , and excellent prior constraints are available for the limb darkening ( not only as it affects the continuum but also the absorption lines ) .",
    "these conditions are not met simultaneously for any of the systems in our sample .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion and an application of a model with differential rotation to the wasp-7 system .      a model which aims to simulate rv measurements made during transits needs to take into account that the measured rvs represent the output of a doppler - measuring code .",
    "these codes are complex but in essence they locate the peak of a cross - correlation between a stellar template spectrum obtained outside transit , and a spectrum observed during transit . depending on the system",
    "parameters these rvs can significantly differ from rvs representing the first moment of the absorption line .",
    "the later are often used in rm work potentially leading to systematic errors in the derived parameters @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a semi - analytic description of the shift in the cross - correlation peak as a function of the transit parameters , including the dependence of the rvs on the stellar rotation velocity and obliquity , the microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities , the differential rotation profile , and the psf of the spectrograph .",
    "we used this model , after extending it to include the convective blueshift .",
    "we also tested the results of the code by @xcite with the fully numerical disk - integration code of @xcite , including the same physical effects , finding good agreement .",
    "figure  [ fig : show_lines ] shows the influence of the effects discussed in this and the previous sections on the stellar absorption lines .",
    "in addition to the rm effect we must also model the changes in radial velocity due to the star s orbital motion . over the course of the transit night , this motion can usually be represented as a linear function of time , and parameterized by a constant acceleration .",
    "for ease of comparison with existing orbital solutions , the out - of - transit velocity trend may also be parameterized by the orbital velocity semi - amplitude ( @xmath19 ) , for fixed values of the other orbital parameters ( period @xmath20 , eccentricity @xmath21 , argument of pericenter @xmath22 ) .",
    "the question arises whether to allow @xmath19 to be a completely free parameter in our analysis , or whether to use a prior constraint based on a previously published orbital solution .",
    "the answer is not obvious because stars exhibit intrinsic rv noise that may have different amplitudes on different timescales , ranging from a few minutes to days .",
    "short - timescale noise will simply degrade our measurement accuracy , but noise on timescales longer than @xmath236  hr ( such as the noise produced by rotating starspots ) will introduce trends in the rv signal over the course of the transit night . without a specific model for the frequency content of the intrinsic rv noise ,",
    "it is difficult to combine the data obtained sporadically over days or months with the data obtained with much finer time sampling on a single night .",
    "specifically , if we would choose to constrain @xmath24 ( and therefore the transit - night velocity gradient ) based on the orbital solution , there is a risk of introducing a bias in our results because of actual transit - night velocity gradient could be affected by starspot variability or other intrinsic rv noise with timescales longer than a few hours @xcite .",

    "we imposed gaussian priors on @xmath32 , the total transit duration from first to last contact ( @xmath33 ) , and the ingress duration ( @xmath34 ) , based on previously reported photometric analyses . by choosing those particular parameters we minimized the correlations among their uncertainties @xcite , consistent with our treatment of the priors as independent gaussian functions .",

    "@xmath19 is ten times larger than the amplitude of the rm effect making a clean separation of the rm effect from the orbital radial velocity challenging .",
    "in addition the rm amplitude is with @xmath65  ms@xmath7 only a few times larger than the typical uncertainty in the rv measurements .",
    "@xcite argued that for low snr detections and for @xmath1 near @xmath66 or @xmath67 the uncertainty in @xmath1 can be underestimated .",
    "however we can not rule out the possibility that our model is missing some aspect of stellar astrophysics , perhaps one that is most apparent for nearly pole - on systems .",
    "the hat - p-7 system is the only system in our sample where there exists a significant disagreement between several independent measures of @xmath1 .",
    "since the discrepancies are unresolved , and to avoid over - interpretation of the results in the subsequent discussion , the uncertainty reported in table  [ tab : results ] is the standard deviation ( @xmath68 ) of the three independent measurements .",
    "the existence of hat - p-16b was announced by @xcite .",
    "we observed this northern system with the kecki telescope during the night 26/27 december 2010 . due to bad weather we were only able to observe the second half of the transit ( figure  [ fig : hatp16 ] ) .",
    "no data before the transit were obtained .",
    "using these rvs together with the photometric and @xmath2 ( @xmath69  kms@xmath7 ) priors from @xcite we found that hat - p-16b orbits its host star on a prograde orbit ( @xmath70@xmath60 ) . while the data are consistent with good alignment , little more can be learned .",
    "concerning @xmath2 we found a value of @xmath71  kms@xmath7 , consistent with the prior .",

    "we obtained hires spectra of this system during the night 27/28 september 2010 .",
    "as was the case for hat - p-16 , the observations were interrupted by bad weather , but at least for hat - p-24 we obtained one pre - ingress data point ( see figure  [ fig : hatp24 ] ) .",
    "this is why the result , @xmath73 , is much more precise than for hat - p-16 . nevertheless with the current data set",
    "is it not possible to exclude a small misalignment .",
    "hat - p-32b was detected around a star which displays rv jitter on the order of 80ms@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "therefore the snr of the rm effect detection in our dataset , obtained on 5/6 december 2011 , is relatively low ( see figure  [ fig : hatp32 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless this is the system in our sample for which we obtain the highest precision in our measurement of the projected obliquity ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this curious fact is the consequence of the system having a low impact parameter ( @xmath75 ) _ and _ at the same time presenting an asymmetric rm curve .    for systems with low impact parameters , even a strong misalignment will lead mostly to a reduction of the amplitude of the rm effect , with hardly any asymmetry in the rm curve .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". only a narrow range of angles near @xmath76 can produce a asymmetric rm effect .",
    "therefore when an asymmetry is detected in such a system , even relatively coarse rv data will lead to high precision in @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly if we take the @xmath2 prior at face value and assume that our rm model contains all the relevant physics , then we find with @xmath77  hr a fivefold improvement in our knowledge of the ingress duration compared to the prior constraint ( @xmath78  hr ) .",
    "this is because for a given @xmath79 and @xmath1 near @xmath80 , the impact parameter is encoded in the amplitude of the rm effect .",
    "the pairing of hat - p-32 and hat - p-2 is instructive ( see section  [ sec : hatp2 ] ) . for hat - p-2",
    "the rm effect was observed with a very high snr : the ratio between the amplitude of the rm effect and the typical rv uncertainty in the rvs is @xmath81 .",
    "but despite the very high snr in the detection of the rm effect , we obtained a relatively low precision in the measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "this is the reverse of what we see for hat - p-32 . for this system ,",
    "the ratio between the amplitude of the rm effect and the average rv uncertainty is @xmath82 .",
    "nevertheless we obtain a very high precision in the measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "this highlights how important the geometry of the transit _ together _ with the projected obliquity is in determining the pression in the measurement of the projected obliquity .",
    "hat - p-34b was announced by @xcite together with three other transiting planets .",
    "hat - p-34b orbits its host star on a highly eccentric ( @xmath83 ) orbit with a relatively long period of @xmath84  days .",
    "we observed this system with hires during the night 2/3 september 2011 .",
    "we obtained 62 spectra during and after the transit ( figure  [ fig : hatp34 ] ) .",
    "as the rm curve suggests we find that the projections of the stellar rotation and orbital angular momenta are well aligned ( @xmath85 ) .",

    "we observed the rm effect in this system on 1/2 january 2012 with the kecki telescope .",
    "our analysis of the 38 rvs ( figure  [ fig : wasp12 ] , left panel ) obtained before , during , and after the 3  hr transit indicates a misalignment of @xmath87@xmath60 and @xmath88  kms@xmath7 . for this system",
    "there is a strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; for higher projected rotation speeds @xmath1 increases and approaches @xmath76 ( figure  [ fig : wasp12 ] , right panel ) .",

    "it seems very likely that the star and the planetary orbit are misaligned , though we can not tell with certainty how much of the misalignment is in the plane of the sky as opposed to the perpendicular direction .",

    "we used the ephemeris and information on the projected rotation speed from the discovery paper as prior information in the fit .",
    "as no information on @xmath34 was given , we used the eulercam light curve presented in the discovery paper to establish priors for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath32 .",

    "these observations agree with the previously reported orbital solution .",
    "a large stellar spot might be responsible for the excess rv change during the transit night ( see section  [ sec : rv_var ] ) , although such a spot would need to cover a substantial part of the stellar surface .",
    "we omitted 9 data points obtained at the end of the transit night , after the template observation for wasp-16 was obtained .",
    "these observations would in principle facilitate a separation of the rm signal from other sources of rv variation .",
    "however , given that there is already an indication of intrinsic rv variations apart from orbital motion , and the absence of any guarantee that the intrinsic variations are linear in time over the course of many hours , we decided to use only the data points immediately following egress .",
    "all the rvs are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] . using the 31 remaining rv data points obtained during and after the transit we obtained @xmath95@xmath60 and @xmath96  kms@xmath7 .",

    "wasp-18b orbits its host star in only @xmath99  days @xcite . as noted by the discoverers it is an excellent system to study the tidal interaction between a gas giant and its host star .",
    "@xcite found the projections of the stellar spin and orbital axes to be aligned ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "we obtained 48 data points with the pfs during the night 8/9 october 2011 .",

    "our photometric priors were based on results by @xcite .",

    "this could in principle make our observation of @xmath1 dependent on their obliquity observation .",
    "however given the quality of their photometric and rv data , we expect that the rvs obtained by them have little influence on their results for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we therefore expect our result ( @xmath104 ) to be independent of their result ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "our prior on the projected rotation speed was taken from the discovery paper .    as can be seen in figure  [ fig : wasp19 ]",
    "there is correlated excess noise in the rvs during pre - egress .",
    "this together with the low snr detection raises the concern that we might not have detected a rm effect at all , and we are fitting our rm model to noise .",
    "we carried out an experiment similar to the one described by @xcite for the wasp-2 system .",
    "briefly , we create @xmath106 fake datasets with similar noise characteristics as the real dataset , but without an underlying rm effect .",
    "we then fitted an rm model to each dataset .",
    "form the resulting density distribution we conclude that our rm detection represents a 3@xmath46 detection .",
    "we also used the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) to assess whether the model including the rm effect is preferred over a model without the rm effect ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the rm model is preferred , with bic@xmath107 and bic@xmath108 .",
    "however the bic test depends somewhat on how many of the rv measurements were obtained during transit , compared to the number obtained outside of transit .",

    "this is because the former authors estimated @xmath26 under the assumption that the macroturbulent parameters is @xmath109  kms@xmath7 .",
    "this is closer to our estimation ( @xmath110  kms@xmath7 ) than the value of @xmath111  kms@xmath7 used by the latter authors . ]",

    "this is consistent with the result by @xcite . for our final results we decided to use the timing information from @xcite , who used the ephemeris from the discovery paper in combination with an additional light curve ( although we note that the new light curve contains only a small amount of post - egress data ) .    therefore while we have excellent agreement between two different research groups , the dependence of the result on the photometric priors and the inconsistency between the results using the same rvs but different timing information cast some doubt on the formal uncertainty intervals .",
    "for this reason , we double the uncertainty in @xmath1 before including this system in the subsequent discussion of the interpretation of all the results .",
    "future photometric observations will be helpful , but at least it seems clear that the projected obliquity is small .",
    "the transiting planet in gl436 was discovered by @xcite and found to be transiting by @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to know the obliquity in this system as gl436b is of similar mass then hat - p-11b , which is so far the only neptune - class planet for which the host star s obliquity has been measured . using hires we obtained rvs of the system during the night of 24/25  april  2010 .",
    "to reduce the uncertainties in the photometric parameters , we gathered new photometric data with keplercam , a ccd camera on the @xmath121  m telescope of the fred l.  whipple observatory on mount hopkins , arizona @xcite .",
    "the rv measurements are displayed in the left panels of figure  [ fig : gi436 ] .",
    "the right panels display the posterior in the @xmath1  @xmath2 plane .",
    "no rm effect was detected , and therefore the data provide no constraint on @xmath1 .",
    "only an upper limit of @xmath122  kms@xmath7 on @xmath2 can be obtained .",
    "this upper limit on @xmath79 is more constraining than the prior we adopted , which was a one - sided gaussian prior enforcing @xmath123  kms@xmath7 .",
    "thus from the transit data we learned only that the star is a slow rotator .",
    "the structure in the posterior distribution is caused by the lower sensitivity of our measurement for nearly prograde and retrograde configurations .",
    "see @xcite for an explanation of this effect .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of kepler-8 and also found @xmath124 , a misalignment between the projections of the stellar and orbital spins .",
    "as the data set available to @xcite only consisted of data taken during the transit itself , it is difficult to assign a significance to the result .",
    "we therefore obtained a new data set with hires during the transit night 7/8 august 2011 .",
    "we used both hires data sets in our analysis , including two additional parameters representing a second velocity offset and a second rv transit - night velocity gradient between the two different transit nights .",
    "flat priors were assigned to these parameters .",
    "we found that the data are consistent with good alignment between the stellar and orbital rotation axes ( see figure  [ fig : kepler8 ] ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath125 and @xmath126  kms@xmath7 .",
    "the velocity offset between the two data sets was found to be @xmath127  ms@xmath7 . using only the new dataset in our analysis , we obtained @xmath128 . using only the older dataset",
    ", we obtained @xmath129@xmath130 .",
    "we chose to use both datasets for this system , as they have been obtained with the same instrument and setup , and the rvs were extracted with the same code , circumstances different from all the other systems for which multiple transits have been observed .",
    "furthermore this case highlights the importance of prior constraints on the data . without a constraint on the rv offset as applied by @xcite , the original dataset is consistent with good alignment .",
    "hat - p-2 was one of the first systems for which a measurement of the projected obliquity was reported .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath131 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath132@xmath130 , a similar value .",
    "the uncertainty in this measurement is relatively high because hat - p-2b has a low impact parameter .",
    "after these results were published , new and improved system parameters based on new photometry were reported by @xcite .",
    "for this reason we reanalyzed the rvs obtained by @xcite together with the new photometric priors , obtaining @xmath133 .",
    "thanks to the improved photometric information , the formal uncertainty in @xmath1 is now lower , and supports a 1.8@xmath46 `` detection '' of a misalignment , a different conclusion from the one by @xcite .",
    "however , one can see in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : hd147506 ] that , after subtraction of our best fitting model , structure remains in the residuals .",
    "this is a clear sign that our model does not capture all the effects influencing the rv anomaly during transit .",
    "we therefore consider the uncertainty of our analysis to be itself quite uncertain , by at least a factor of two . in table",
    "[ tab : results ] we report a doubled uncertainty relative to our formal results for @xmath1 and @xmath79 . therefore while the photometric information as well as the quality of the rv data would allow for a measurement of @xmath1 to within a few degrees , the limitations of our model of the rm effect prevent this gain from being fully realized .",
    "the model expects a larger rm effect shortly before and after mid - transit and a lower amplitude around the second and third contacts .",
    "one possible effect that would produce this type of structured residuals is a change of limb darkening with depths of stellar absorption lines .",

    "@xcite suggested that the second scenario is more likely and that the factor associated with temperature is the rate of tidal dissipation due to the tide raised by the planet .",
    "the reason for this suspicion was that @xmath0  k is not an arbitrary temperature , but rather represents an approximate boundary over which the internal structure of a main - sequence star changes substantially .",
    "stars hotter than this level have very thin or absent convective envelopes , with the mass of the envelope dropping below about @xmath158 at 6250  k @xcite .",
    "( for the sun , the mass of the convective envelope is around @xmath159 ) .    independently of this theoretical expectation , there is dramatic empirical evidence for a transition in stellar properties across the 6250  k",
    "divide : hotter stars are observed to rotate more rapidly . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : proj_obli ] , we plot the projected rotation speeds of a sample of @xmath160 stars from the catalogue by @xcite .",
    "the projected rotational speed @xmath2 increases rapidly around 6250  k. for f0 stars , the rotation speed can approach @xmath18  kms@xmath7 .",
    "it is thought that stellar rotation together with the convection in the envelope create a magnetic field coupling to the ionized stellar wind far beyond the stellar radius and thereby transport angular momentum away from the stellar rotation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for further discussion . )",
    "presumably this magnetic braking is less effective for stars without convective envelopes , leading to the observed rapid increase in stellar rotation speeds towards earlier spectral type .",
    "judging from figure  [ fig : proj_obli ] , the transition from low obliquity to high obliquity seems to be linked empirically to this transition from slowly - rotating to rapidly - rotating stars .",
    "the presence of a convective envelope is also expected to change the rate of dissipation of the energy in tidal oscillations .",
    "energy contained in tidal bulges is thought to be more effectively dissipated by turbulent eddies in convective envelopes than by any mechanism acting in a radiative envelope .",
    "see @xcite for a review on the theory of tidal interactions . @xcite and @xcite review the evidence for tidal interactions in double - star systems , and provide more access points to the literature .",
    "if tidal evolution is responsible for the difference in stellar obliquities between cool and hot stars , then there should also be a correlation between the mass ratio of the star and planet and the degree of alignment .",
    "the higher the mass of the planet ( @xmath161 ) relative to the mass of the star ( @xmath162 ) , the faster its tides can align the stellar and orbital angular momentum vectors .",
    "furthermore , one would expect an inverse correlation between the scaled semi - major axis ( @xmath29 ) and the obliquity .",
    "a more distant companion will raise smaller tides .",

    "in contrast , the cool - star systems probe nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "note that two of the close - in , misaligned systems are the systems with the hottest host stars ( wasp-33 and koi-13 ) .",
    "this lack of alignment finds an explanation in the tidal hypothesis : despite the tight orbits , the tidal dissipation rate may be relatively low due to thin or non - existent convective layer .",
    "[ [ sec : age ] ] age + + +    under the tidal hypothesis , older systems should tend to be closer to alignment than younger systems , all else being equal .",
    "this is because in older systems , tides have had a longer interval over which to act .",
    "included in `` all else being equal '' is the underlying assumption that the arrival time of the hot jupiter to its close - in orbit is the same in all systems .",
    "@xcite presented empirical evidence that the degree of misalignment depends chiefly on the age of the system .",
    "he found that all systems in his sample with ages greater than @xmath166  gyr are aligned ( see his figure  2 ) .",

    "it seems as though the development of a convective envelope with age , rather than the age itself , might be driving the degree of alignment .     *",
    "projected obliquity plotted as function of age for stars with @xmath170*. this is a similar plot to the one presented by @xcite .",
    "same symbols used as in figure  [ fig : proj_obli ] .",
    "systems which are older than @xmath171  gyr are cool enough to develop a convective envelope .",
    "this plot is therefore a relative to figure  [ fig : proj_obli ] . ]      as we have seen in the last section that the degree of alignment is correlated with stellar temperature , the mass ratio , and possibly the orbital distance .",
    "we now try in this section to establish a single quantitative relationship between the degree of alignment and those parameters .",
    "ideally we could calculate a theoretical alignment timescale for each system , and compare that timescale to the estimated age of the system .",
    "we could then check if systems with a relatively short timescale ( fast alignment ) tend to have low obliquities , and systems with timescales comparable to the lifetime of the system ( or larger ) tend to have high obliquities .        calculating timescales needed to synchronize and align stellar rotation",
    "is a complex task .",
    "apart from the parameters mentioned above , there are other parameters that would influence the time needed for alignment .",
    "for example the total amount of angular momentum stored in the stellar rotation , and the driving frequency of the tidal force ( i.e.  twice the orbital frequency ) , are expected to be important .",
    "in addition , the rate of dissipation is not expected to be constant over gyr timescales due to the contemporaneous evolution in orbital distance and eccentricity , and due to stellar evolution . even worse , the specific mechanisms for dissipating tidal energy are not completely understood , neither for stars with radiative envelopes nor for stars with convective envelopes .",
    "nevertheless there are some simple considerations we may employ to obtain approximate timescales for alignment .    1",
    ".   we can use the formulae provided by @xcite for synchronization .",
    "the coefficients in these formulae are difficult to derive from theory alone , but they can be calibrated with observations made in binary star systems . by observing the maximum orbital distance within which binary stars are observed to be spin - orbit synchronized , and knowing the lifetime of the stars on the main sequence , the relevant parameters can be estimated .",
    "to apply this to our sample two different formulae are needed .",
    "one for cool stars which have convective envelopes ( ce ) and hot stars which have radiative envelopes ( ra ) .",
    "therefore this approach has the virtue of empirical calibration , although the calibration is for star - star interactions rather than planet - star interactions , and the calibration is for spin synchronization rather than reorientation .",
    "one complication is that to apply these formulae we have to make a binary decision on whether a star is `` convective '' or `` radiative '' which does not reflect the gradual thinning of the convective envelope with increasing stellar temperature .",
    "we choose a temperature of @xmath165  k for this boundary .",
    "2 .   assuming that the alignment timescale due to dissipation in convective envelopes ( @xmath172 ) is always shorter than the time needed for alignment by forces in radiative envelopes ( @xmath173 ) we can try to derive a simple relationship between the mass contained in the convective envelope and the alignment timescale @xmath174 . this would have the advantage that the gradual decrease of mass in the convective envelope can be easily incorporated , but we ignore here any possible additional dissipation mechanism in the radiative envelope which for higher temperatures would become important .",
    "in addition it is not obvious why @xmath175 should depend linearly on the mass contained in the convective envelope , nor can we be completely confident in our estimate of the convective mass based only on the observable parameters of the stellar photosphere .",
    "and of course the convective mass is not really a constant over gyr timescales .",
    "the simplifications made by either approach should cause us not to expect a perfect and deterministic relationship between our theoretical parameters and the observed obliquities [ and we direct the reader to @xcite for a different approach to this comparison ] .",
    "for the first approach we obtain the following relationships between the system parameters and the convective and radiative timescale for alignment from ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , @xmath176    @xmath177    here @xmath178 is the planet - to - star mass ratio . for stars with convective envelopes , synchronization is observed for binaries out to a scaled distance of @xmath179 during their main - sequence life , which we set to @xmath180  gyr for all cool stars . for hot stars , synchronization in binaries",
    "is observed out to @xmath181 times the scaled radius .",
    "tidal damping is expected to be most efficient during the first quarter of their main sequence life @xcite ( which we set here to @xmath141  gyr ) .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a more recent comparison between theory and observations , mainly for stars of higher mass .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tau ] we show the projected obliquity versus the characteristic timescale needed for realignment . for this we used equation  [ equ : ce ] for @xmath182  k and equation  [ equ : ra ] for @xmath183  k. ( both timescales were divided by @xmath184 for normalization . ) for most of the systems for which rapid alignment is expected ,",
    "low projected obliquities are observed . for systems",
    "where tides are expected to be too slow in aligning and synchronizing stellar rotation , a very broad range of projected obliquities ( apparently random ) is observed .",
    "we now return to the three apparent outliers from figure  [ fig : proj_obli ] : hat - p-11 , wasp-8 , and hd80606 . while these are all stars with convective envelopes , the timescales for alignment are very long .",
    "this is because the scaled distances are greater than @xmath185 ( figure  [ fig : ar ] ) . in the case of hat - p-11",
    "there is also the additional penalty from the relatively small planet mass ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "thus , in this light , these three `` outliers '' are not exceptions ; they have high obliquities because the tidal timescales are very long .",
    "there is one system which does seem to be an exception : hat - p-32 .",
    "the rotation axis of the star nearly lays in the plane of the orbit ( @xmath74 ) , while all other systems with a similar tidal timescale do have projected obliquities consistent with good alignment . because of the obliquity near @xmath155 tides couple only weakly to the stellar rotation @xcite .",
    "the timescale for alignment in this system could be longer than estimated by our simple formula . if this is the only reason for the high obliquity in the hat - p-32 system then we might expect to find more systems with short alignment timescales and similar obliquities in figure  [ fig : tau ] , which do not exist in the current sample .",
    "the measured effective temperature in hat - p-32 is @xmath187  k , and therefore we used equation  [ equ : ce ] , applicable to stars with convective envelopes . if we would have assumed an effective temperature of @xmath165  k , a value within the @xmath12-@xmath46 interval of the measurement , and used equation  [ equ : ra ] then we would have obtained a @xmath173 of @xmath188  yr instead of @xmath189  yr .",
    "this illustrates the aforementioned weakness of this first approach , that we have to make a binary decision on whether a star is `` convective '' or `` radiative . ''",
    "note also that koi-13 and xo-3 are `` hot '' stars which have significant misalignments , and yet they are found in between `` cool '' aligned systems .",
    "koi-13 ( @xmath190  k ) is hottest star in our sample and it is questionable if we can use the same tidal timescale for this system as for the other hot systems which are about @xmath191  k cooler ( see figure  [ fig : proj_obli ] ) .    in the second approach",
    "we build upon equation  [ equ : ce ] .",
    "now we do not use any empirical calibration . for each planet - hosting star",
    "we estimate the mass contained in the convective envelope , and assume that the rate of energy dissipation is proportional to this convective mass , @xmath192 where @xmath193 indicates the mass contained in the outer convective zone and @xmath194 is an unspecified proportionality constant with units g  s@xmath7 .",
    "our estimate for @xmath193 is based on the measured @xmath8 .",
    "this ensures a gradual decrease of tidal forces with increasing temperature . to establish the relation between @xmath8 and convective mass we used the ez - web tool for stars with @xmath195 , and the data from @xcite for hotter stars",
    ". to create figure  [ fig : tau2 ] we further divided the tidal timescale by the estimated main - sequence age , taking the uncertainty in the age estimate into account .",
    "as the ages are not well known , this leads to a substantial uncertainty in the positioning of a system on the horizontal axis . on average ,",
    "the hot stars are younger than the cool stars .",
    "therefore the main effect of the division by age is a small shift of the hotter stars to the right side of the logarithmic plot .",
    "the ordering of the cool stars is not substantially changed , relative to figure  [ fig : tau ] , but there are now a few hot stars with significant obliquities and with similar tidal timescales as some cool aligned systems .",
    "the biggest outlier in this respect is hat - p-7 .    in summary , despite the shortcomings of our highly simplified approaches to calculating the theoretical tidal timescale , and a few exceptional cases",
    ", we do find support for the claim that the obliquities in hot jupiter systems undergo damping by tidal dissipation .",
    "systems with short tidal timescales are predominantly well - aligned , while systems with longer tidal timescales display an apparently random obliquity distribution .",
    "the implication is that the obliquities were once even more broadly distributed than we observe them today .",
    "put differently , the `` primordial '' orbits of hot jupiters ( the orbits that existed shortly after the planets arrived close to the star ) once had a very broad range of inclinations relative to the stellar equatorial plane .",
    "as @xcite already pointed out , there is a theoretical problem with invoking tides in this context .",
    "the angular momentum in the stellar rotation compared to the angular momentum in the orbit ( when the planet is close enough to significantly effect the stars rotation via tides ) is so large that to synchronize and align the star the planet would surrender so much angular momentum that it would spiral into the star . for nearly all systems in our sample the orbital velocity ( at periastron ) is larger than stellar rotation velocity .",
    "this causes trailing tides , and angular momentum is transported from the orbit towards the stellar rotation , leading to decay of the orbit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "yet we see systems which have aligned axes and the planets have evidently survived .",
    "to address this problem @xcite speculated that only the outer layers of the star synchronize and align with the orbit . in that case a smaller amount of the angular momentum would be transferred and the planetary inspiral would be avoided .",
    "it seems doubtful , though , that a separate rotation speed and rotation direction for the envelope relative to the stellar interior could be maintained for billions of years .",
    "more recently @xcite suggested that the angular momentum problem is not as serious as it might seem .",
    "given the complexities of tidal dynamics , he argued that there is no strong theoretical reason why the timescale for realignment must equal the timescale for synchronization , and indeed he provided a particular theoretical tidal model in which those timescales can differ by orders of magnitude . in his scenario",
    "the planets would first align the stellar rotation , and only much later speed up the rotation and spiral inward .    in this respect",
    "it is interesting that the tidal timescale calibrated via synchronization apparently sorts the systems consistently relative to each other , but the overall timescale is too long by orders of magnitude .",
    "as mentioned above we divided the timescales displayed in figure  [ fig : tau ] by @xmath184 .",
    "this could imply that realignment happens on a shorter timescale than synchronization .",
    "however the calibration of the synchronization timescale was done with binary star systems having @xmath196 , and the tidal mechanism itself might be different for different regimes of its strength @xcite .",
    "one might be able to test the hypothesis of @xcite by seeking evidence for excess rotation in stars that are thought to have been realigned ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "this could be done by measuring the stellar rotation period or @xmath2 ( if one is willing to assume @xmath198 is near unity in such systems ) .",
    "if an age estimate is also available , then one could employ the same approach as @xcite to assess whether or not the star is rotating at a typical rate , or if it is in the process of being spun up by the planet .",
    "this type of analysis was pursued by @xcite , though not with this specific hypothesis test in mind .",
    "this analysis could be profitably revisited now that many more systems are available for study .",
    "there is one caveat to this approach , which is that stars undergo very rapid spin evolution early in their lives due to disk - locking and magnetic braking , i.e. , for reasons unrelated to planets .",
    "if hot jupiters arrive very early in the star s history , the realignment might happen in an epoch of rapid decrease of stellar rotation and any memory of an increased rotation due to tides raised by the planet might be lost .",
    "the recent work by @xcite presented a calibration of the equilibrium tide theory using the measured parameters of hot - jupiter systems . while the approach taken in his work",
    "is different from ours , he arrived at similar conclusions to those described here : tides have shaped the obliquity distribution in these systems , and there is no theoretical need for core - envelope decoupling .      to interpret the finding that the host stars of hot jupiters once had a broad distribution of obliquities , we must answer a crucial question .",
    "we need to know if the original obliquity is related to the existence of the hot jupiter , or if stars and their protoplanetary disks are frequently misaligned for reasons unrelated to hot jupiters .",
    "one might expect an initially close alignment between a star and its protoplanetary disk , as is observed in the solar system and has been generally assumed in the exoplanet literature .",
    "however this is not a foregone conclusion , and indeed several authors have recently challenged this assumption , proposing that the sun s low obliquity may be an atypical case .",
    "@xcite proposed that a disk might become inclined with respect to the rotation axis of the central star , as a result of the complex accretion environment within a star cluster .",
    "in such a dense environment the tidal interaction with a companion star or other nearby stars could produce chaotic perturbations in the orbits of infalling material , with the material accreting later ( destined to become planets ) having a different orientation than the material that accreted earlier onto the star .",
    "@xcite studied the process of inclined infall of gas in detail and found that short period planets on eccentric and inclined orbits can be created in this way .",
    "a completely different mechanism for generating primordial misalignments was proposed by @xcite , relying on a magnetic interaction between a young star and the inner edge of its accretion disk .    in these scenarios ,",
    "the star has a high obliquity even though the planets may have never left the plane of the disk out of which they have formed , and therefore the measurements of obliquities bear information about the processes surrounding star formation rather than planet migration .",
    "how can one distinguish between misalignment created during the time the planet is still embedded in the disk or after the disk dissipated ?    one approach , pursued by @xcite , is to assess the degree of alignment between stars and their debris disks . assuming that the stars as well as the debris disks trace the alignment of their predecessors one would learn about the degree of the alignment during the final stages of planet formation .",
    "@xcite found the inclinations of debris disks and their stars in a sample of 9 systems to be consistent with good alignment .",
    "they caution that in their study only systems with @xmath199  k have been observed and that misaligned system are found around hotter stars .",
    "however as we have argued above , the found low obliquities that prevail around cool stars may be a consequence of tidal evolution and not of the mechanism which creates the obliquities .",
    "another approach is to measure the obliquities in binary star systems .",
    "if disks would be tilted relative to stellar rotation due to close encounters , then this could also lead to tilted rotation axes in double star systems .",
    "there should also be a trend towards misalignment with larger separation between the components in these systems .",
    "conducting such measurements and seeking evidence for such trends is one of the goals of an ongoing observational program entitled banana ( binaries are not always neatly aligned ; * ? ? ?",
    "a more direct way to answer the question raised in the preceding section has recently become possible , thanks to the discovery of systems with multiple transiting planets .",
    "a number of arguments support the idea that the orbital planes in such systems are closely aligned ; most recently @xcite used the measured transit durations to show that the typical mutual inclinations are of order @xmath200 .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that the multiple planetary orbits trace the plane in which the planets formed .",
    "any disruptive dynamical interactions , such as those which have been proposed to explain hot jupiters , would likely have produced higher mutual inclinations in the multiple - transiting systems . under that assumption ,",
    "rm measurements ( or other measures of obliquity ) in those multiple - transiting systems would establish the angle between the circumstellar disk and the stellar equator .",
    "if good alignment is found to be the rule , then the high obliquities in hot jupiter systems would be more readily interpreted as a consequence of planet migration than as primordial star - disk misalignments .",
    "in this paper we have presented new observations of the rm effect for 14 systems harboring hot jupiters .",
    "in addition we critically reviewed the literature , in some cases re - analyzing data that had been obtained previously in order to conform with our protocols .",
    "we then used these data to show that the distribution in obliquities is consistent with being shaped by tides raised by the hot jupiters on the stars .",
    "for this we revisited the correlation between the projected obliquity and the effective temperature discovered by @xcite , now with a sample of rm measurements twice as large as was then available .",
    "we showed that the new measurements agree with the pattern proposed by @xcite . with the enlarged sample we showed that obliquity in systems with close in massive planets",
    "further depend on the mass ratio and the distance between star and planet , in roughly the manner expected if tides are responsible for the low obliquities .    motivated by these results",
    "we then devised two different parameters that represent , at least crudely , the theoretical tidal timescales .",
    "this showed that systems which are expected to align fast are all showing projections of the obliquities which are consistent with good alignment .",
    "in contrast , systems for which tidal interaction is expected to be weak , due to the stellar structure , distance , or mass ratio , show a nearly random distribution of projected obliquities .",
    "our interpretation is that stars with hot jupiters once had a very broad range of obliquities .",
    "it is tempting to argue further that the large obliquities originate from the same process that produces hot jupiters , thereby favoring explanations involving dynamical scattering or the kozai effect , and disfavoring the gradual inspiral due to torques in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "however , more observations are needed to check on the possibility that stars and their disks are frequently misaligned for reasons unrelated to hot jupiters . among these observations",
    "are the extension of rm studies to planets other than hot jupiters , and measurements of obliquities in binary star systems and in systems with multiple transiting planets .",
