    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "perfect graphs are important and well - studied for several reasons ( cf .",
    ", e.  g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , one of which is certainly the long - standing conjecture of claude berge known as the strong perfect graph conjecture , which has been proved recently by chudnovsky , robertson , seymour , and thomas @xcite .",
    "a conjecture of similar flavour has been formulated by de simone and krner @xcite to characterize those graphs all induced subgraphs of which are normal .",
    "this latter conjecture is still open .",
    "( see it below . )",
    "there are several important subclasses of perfect graphs known , and by krner s theorem in @xcite all these are also normal .",
    "very few graph families were , however , identified yet as being normal among those that are not necessarily perfect .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that the members of a certain family , namely those graphs that are line graphs of cubic graphs are all normal .",
    "this class of graphs is interesting , for example , for its connections to the four colour theorem and related conjectures , see , e.  g. , @xcite .",
    "now we give the definition of normality .",

    "it follows that a graph is normal iff its complement is normal .",
    "if we require normality for every induced subgraph , we obtain the notion of hereditary normality . clearly , every perfect graph is hereditarily normal , since every induced subgraph of a perfect graph is perfect and consequently normal .",
    "the simplest graphs which are normal but not perfect are the odd cycles with at least 9 vertices ( see @xcite ) .",
    "smaller odd cycles are either perfect , like the triangle , or not even normal , like the cycles with 5 or 7 vertices . actually , these latter graphs and the complement of the 7-cycle are the only minimal not hereditarily normal graphs known so far .",
    "this motivates the following conjecture formulated by de simone and krner @xcite .",

    "it would immediately follow that the class of heredtarily normal graphs can be recognized in polynomial time .",

    "recall , that the line graph @xmath12 of a graph @xmath4 is a graph whose vertices are the edges of @xmath4 , and two vertices of @xmath12 are connected if and only if the edges corresponding to them share a common vertex in @xmath4 .",

    "the set of all these cliques , together with the previously mentioned stable sets fulfill the requirements of normality .",

    "the nontrivial part of the theorem is that the statement also holds for the so called snarks ( @xcite ) , i. e. those cubic graphs which have edge - chromatic number 4 .",
    "a similar phenomenon can be observed in case of some famous theorems and conjectures like the four colour thorem , the 5-flow conjecture or the cycle double cover conjecture .",
    "they can also be reduced to statements about snarks , and then the proof of those statments are unknown or by far non - trivial .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaryobservations ] some preliminary observations are made about normal graphs and normal line graphs . in section [ sec : regular2edgeconnected ] we prove a technical lemma , lemma [ lma:2_connected2 ] , from whcih the statement of theorem [ thm : main ] follows for 2-edge - connected graphs . in section",

    "let these neighbours be @xmath270 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "( here it also does not matter if @xmath270 and @xmath32 coincide . )",
    "there is a @xmath341 for which @xmath342 , and @xmath343 , because @xmath344 is a stable set in @xmath284 .",
    "but for this @xmath125 there is a component of @xmath340 $ ] which is a @xmath303 , so @xmath328 can not be a wrong set , because of the third statement of lemma [ lma : technical ] , that is , c is good .",
    "the previous conditions are not fulfilled , but the third neighbour of @xmath270 ( not @xmath336 and not @xmath32 ) is not the same as the third neighbour of @xmath32 ( not @xmath133 and not @xmath270 ) .",
    "let this neighbour of @xmath32 be @xmath113 .",
    "then there is a @xmath341 for which @xmath345 , and @xmath346 , because @xmath347 is a stable set of @xmath284 .",
    "but for this @xmath125 there is a component of @xmath340 $ ] which is a @xmath304 , and @xmath134 is one of its endpoint , so @xmath328 can not be a wrong set , by the fourth statement of lemma [ lma : technical ] , that is , c is good .",
    "5 .   the previous conditions are not fulfilled .",
    "this can not happen , because the third edge going out of @xmath113 is also a cutting edge , which contradicts the fact that @xmath328 is the body of @xmath4 , and this body is 2-edge - connected .",
    "so , @xmath284 is strongly edge - normal , which is a contradiction .",
    "we reached the point , where we can complete the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "we make the previously promised decomposition in this proof .",
    "we prove the stronger statement : every cubic graph is strongly edge - normal .",
    "suppose , that there exists a graph @xmath27 , which contradicts this .",
    "then @xmath4 is a non - strongly - edge - normal cubic graph with arms .",
    "that is , there exists a minimal , nonempty subset @xmath37 of @xmath348 , so that , @xmath36 $ ] is a non - strongly - edge - normal cubic graph with arms .",
    "@xmath36 $ ] does not have cutting edges apart from the ones that connect its arms to its body , because of lemma [ lma : connection ] .",
    "so , from lemma [ lma : basic ] it follows , that @xmath36 $ ] is strongly edge - normal , which is a contradiction .",
    "first a corollary , which is the immediate consequence of the previously proven lemmas .",
    "take a graph @xmath27 , the vertices of which have degrees 3 and 1 only .",
    "remember , that it is enough to consider only connected graphs .",
    "so , if there are no vertices with degree 3 , then @xmath4 is a @xmath301 , which is strongly edge - normal .",
    "if there are also vertices with degree 3 , then @xmath4 is a cubic graph with arms .",
    "take its cubic completion @xmath284 . from theorem [ thm : main ] it follows , that @xmath284 is strongly edge - normal .",
    "so , @xmath4 is also strongly edge normal because of lemma [ lma : completion ] , which proves the corollary .",
    "a graph @xmath4 is strongly edge - normal iff it has a good vertex cover @xmath22 .",
    "since every cubic graph is strongly edge - normal , every cubic graph has a good vertex cover .",
    "the proof we presented is constructive in the following sense : it gives an algorithm for finding this good vertex cover .",
    "we describe the algorithm : consider a cubic graph @xmath27 .",
    "we examine whether there exists a cutting edge in @xmath4 .",
    "if there is no cutting edge , then @xmath4 is 2-edge - connected . in this case , as it was developed earlier in corollary [ rmk : every_good ] , every minimal vertex cover is good .",
    "thus , the algorithm has to do only one thing , it has to find a minimal ( with respect to inclusion ) vertex cover .",
    "this together with the search for cutting edge can clearly be done in polynomial time .    from now",
    "on , suppose that @xmath4 is not 2-edge - connected .",
    "we decompose @xmath4 recursively along its cutting edges .",
    "we obtain induced cubic subgraphs of @xmath4 with arms @xmath349 , so that , @xmath4 is the connection of these subgraphs and every subgraph has a 2-edge - connected body .",
    "every @xmath253 has a body with at least one vertex , and every vertex of @xmath4 is part of exactly one body , so we can not get more than @xmath350 graphs at the end of the decomposition .",
    "thus , the decomposition is finished in polynomial time . in lemma",
    "[ lma : connection ] it is described how a good vertex cover of @xmath4 can be obtained if a good vertex cover of every @xmath253 is given .",
    "that is , if we can find a good vertex cover for a cubic graph with arms the body of which is 2-edge - connected in polynomial time then we are ready .",
    "let us fix a graph @xmath45 like this .",
    "the proof of lemma [ lma : basic ] is constructive , that is , it distinguishes between two cases and four more subcases of the second case , and tells us , how a good vertex cover of the cubic completion of @xmath45 should look like in each case and subcase .",
    "one can decide in polynomial time , which case a graph @xmath45 belongs to , and then finding a good vertex cover of the cubic completion is trivial . from lemma [ lma : completion ] we know how to get a good vertex cover of @xmath45 from a good vertex cover of the cubic completion of @xmath45 .",
    "this can also be made in polynomial time .",
