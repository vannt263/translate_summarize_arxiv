    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) has revolutionized our ability to study anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with a precision that is now permitting us to examine the structure of the universe on all scales @xcite .",
    "but several anomalies are generating considerable discussion and debate because they appear to indicate possible deficiencies in the standard model , or perhaps new physics driving the origin of density fluctuations in the early universe and their evolution into the large - scale structure we see today .",
    "these peculiarities include an unusually low power at the largest scales @xcite , as well as a mutual alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments @xcite .",
    "these anomalies have variously been attributed to astrophysical , instrumental , or cosmological causes , and even faulty data analysis or _ a posteriori _",
    "statistics @xcite . the low power and alignment are puzzling because the probability of either occurring within the context of the standard model ( @xmath3cdm ) is less than @xmath4 ; the chance to measure the sky with both has been quantified at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the power on large scales is characterized in terms of the angular correlation function @xmath6 ( defined in eq .  2 below ) .",
    "according to the observations , @xmath6 essentially vanishes at angular separations greater than about @xmath7 @xcite , confirming what was first measured a decade earlier with the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ; @xcite ) .",
    "the absence of any angular correlation at the largest scales is a notable problem for the standard model because it is completely at odds with any inflationary scenario @xcite . yet without inflation , @xmath3cdm simply could not account for the apparent uniformity of the cmb ( other than the aforementioned anisotropies at the level of 1 part in 100,000 ) across the sky .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2 universe @xcite did not undergo a period of inflated expansion , and it is this feature especially that makes it superior to @xmath3cdm in accounting for the observed angular correlation function . the natural question is then whether it can also provide an explanation for the apparent alignment of the cmb s quadrupole and octopole moments .",
    "this is the issue we will be addressing in this paper",
    ". we will first summarize the key aspects of the @xmath2 universe and describe the kinds of all - sky map it produces .",
    "we will then carry out a statistical analysis of thousands of simulated renderings to show that the observed alignment of the cmb quadrupole and octopole moments is not as statistically significant in the @xmath2 universe as it is in @xmath3cdm .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropies @xmath8 extracted from wmap may be written as an expansion using spherical harmonics @xmath9 , @xmath10 from which one can then determine the two - point angular correlation function ( for directions @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) : @xmath13 statistical independence implies that @xmath14 and statistical isotropy further requires that the constant of proportionality depend only on @xmath15 , not @xmath16 : @xmath17 the constant @xmath18 is the angular power of the multipole @xmath15 .",
    "a comparison of the function @xmath6 predicted by the @xmath2 universe with that observed by wmap was the primary goal of our previous paper @xcite .",
    "our focus here will be the second cmb anomaly discussed above , i.e. , the apparent alignment of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . to quantify the statistical significance of this alignment",
    ", we will follow the procedure developed by @xcite .",
    "other techniques have been utilized since then @xcite , but they all appear to confirm each other s results , so for now , at least , we will base our assessment on the former approach .",
    "the method treats the cmb map as a wave function , @xmath21 and seeks to find the axis @xmath22 about which the  angular momentum \" dispersion @xmath23 is maximized .",
    "the coefficients @xmath24 correspond to the spherical harmonics in a rotated coordinate system with the @xmath25-axis in the @xmath22 direction .",
    "for the actual cmb map , the maximization is performed by evaluating eq .",
    "( 7 ) at all the unit vectors @xmath22 corresponding to the pixel centers .",
    "we will follow essentially the same approach , first producing a rendering of the large - scale fluctuations on the whole sky , and then maximizing the angular momentum dispersion using the same equation ( more on this below ) .",
    "previous workers have found the preferred axes @xmath12 and @xmath26 for the quadrupole and octopole moments to be @xmath27 respectively , i.e. , both roughly in the direction @xmath28 in virgo @xcite . in @xmath3cdm ,",
    "a crucial ingredient is cosmological inflation  a brief phase of very rapid expansion from approximately @xmath29 seconds to @xmath30 seconds following the big bang , forcing the universe to expand much more rapidly than would otherwise have been feasible solely under the influence of matter , radiation , and dark energy .",
    "this accelerated expansion would have driven the growth of fluctuations on all scales , resulting in an angular correlation at all angles ( which wmap has shown did not happen citemelia12a ) .",
    "therefore , in @xmath3cdm , the unit vectors @xmath12 and @xmath26 should be independently drawn from a distribution in which all directions are equally likely .",
    "this means that the dot product @xmath31 should be a uniformly distributed random variable on the interval @xmath32 . but as is well known , eq .",
    "( 7 ) does not distinguish between @xmath22 and @xmath33 , so the maximization procedure finds a preferred axis , not a preferred direction .",
    "the alignment should therefore be quantified on the basis of @xmath34 , which instead has a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath35 .",
    "the anomaly emerges when we determine from eq .",
    "( 8) that the observed value of this dot product is @xmath36 , corresponding to a separation of only @xmath37 . as noted by @xcite , an alignment this good happens by chance only once in 62 realizations , suggesting that the probability of finding a random octopole axis within a circle of radius @xmath37 of the quadrupole axis should be less than a few percent . within the context of @xmath3cdm , this alignment is therefore a statistically significant anomaly .",
    "recognizing that producing an accurate map of the wmap data depends critically on correctly identifying the background ( or more accurately in this case , the foreground ) , this calculation has been repeated on several occasions , with an ever increasing precision of the foreground subtraction .",
    "the numbers themselves have changed somewhat , but all subsequent measurements have confirmed the early conclusions .",
    "the most likely outcome currently appears to be an alignment angle @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "even with such a broadened uncertainty range , however , an alignment within @xmath39 should occur only @xmath40 of the time , making it a marginally statistically significant anomaly within the standard model .",
    "let us now see whether this apparent alignment remains a statistically significant anomaly also in the @xmath2 universe .",
    "this alternative description is an frw cosmology that adheres very closely to the restrictions imposed on the theory by the cosmological principle and the weyl postulate @xcite . taken",
    "seriously , these two basic tenets force the gravitational horizon @xmath41 ( known more commonly as the hubble radius ) to always equal @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the cosmic time .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that this equality forces the expansion rate to be constant , so the expansion factor @xmath44 appearing in the friedmann equations must be @xmath45 ( utilizing the convention that @xmath46 today ) , where @xmath47 is the current age of the universe .",
    "@xmath3cdm is an approximation to this precision cosmology because it adopts a specific set of constituents for the energy density @xmath48 , but absent the important constraint that the overall equation of state must be @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath48 are the total pressure and density , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 in @xmath3cdm fluctuates about the mean it would otherwise always have , leading to the awkward situation in which the value of @xmath51 is equal to @xmath52 today , but in order to achieve this  coincidence \" , the universe had to decelerate early on , followed by a more recent acceleration that exactly balanced out the effects of its slowing down at the beginning .",
    "it is specifically this early deceleration in @xmath3cdm that brings it into conflict with the near uniformity of the cmb data @xcite , requiring the introduction of an inflationary phase to rescue it . as shown in @xcite , however",
    ", the recent assessment of the observed angular correlation function simply does not support any kind of inflationary scenario .",
    "there are many reasons for believing that the @xmath2 universe is the correct description of nature , and that at best @xmath3cdm is an approximation that fails in certain limits , particularly in the early universe . among its many successes , the @xmath2 universe provides the following resolution to otherwise unsolvable problems : ( 1 ) it explains why it makes sense to infer a planck mass scale in the early universe by equating the schwarzschild radius to the compton wavelength ( otherwise , why should a delimiting gravitational horizon be invoked in an infinite universe ?",
    "see @xcite for a pedagogical explanation ) ; ( 2 ) it explains why @xmath53 today . in @xmath3cdm",
    "this equality is but one of many coincidences ; ( 3 ) it explains how opposite sides of the cmb could have been in equilibrium at the time ( @xmath54 years ) of recombination , without the need to introduce an ad hoc period of inflation ; ( 4 ) it explains why there is no apparent length scale in the observed matter correlation function ( since there is no jeans length in this cosmology ) ; ( 5 ) it explains why the adoption of @xmath3cdm as an approximation to the @xmath2 universe forces the matter density in that model to represent @xmath55 of the total energy density @xmath48 ; and ( 6 ) it accounts for the location , @xmath56 , of the minimum in @xmath6 and its value , @xmath57 , at that angle and , most importantly , it explains why there is no angular correlation in the cmb at angles greater than about @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    ", we add to this growing list of successful comparisons with the data by demonstrating that , whereas the near alignment of the cmb quadrupole and octopole moments is a statistically significant anomaly for @xmath3cdm , it nonetheless lies within statistically reasonable expectations for the @xmath2 universe .",
    "as shown in @xcite , density fluctuations @xmath58 , written as a wavelike decomposition @xmath59 satisfy the differential equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 in terms of the fluctuation length @xmath62 and the gravitational ( or hubble ) radius @xmath63 .",
    "note , in particular , that both @xmath41 and the fluctuation scale @xmath62 vary with @xmath43 in exactly the same way in this cosmology , so @xmath64 is therefore a constant in time .",
    "but the growth rate of @xmath65 depends critically on whether @xmath62 is less than or greater than @xmath66 .",
    "a simple solution to this equation is the power law @xmath67 where @xmath68 that is , @xmath69 so for small fluctuations ( @xmath70 ) , the growing mode is @xmath71 whereas for large fluctuations ( @xmath72 ) , the dominant mode @xmath73 does not even grow .",
    "the second mode decays away for both small and large fluctuations .",
    "insofar as the quadrupole and octopole moments are concerned , the most critical aspect of the fluctuations implied by these equations is the maximum range over which they would have grown .",
    "the required inflated expansion in @xmath3cdm drives the growth over all scales . in the @xmath2 universe ,",
    "on the other hand , the growth is limited to a maximum fluctuation size @xmath74 thus , since the comoving distance to the last scattering surface ( at time @xmath75 ) is @xmath76 the maximum angular size @xmath77 of any fluctuation associated with the cmb emitted at @xmath75 has to be @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the proper distance to the last scattering surface at time @xmath75 .",
    "that is , @xmath80 for the sake of illustration , we note that the times @xmath81 gyr and @xmath82 yrs from the standard model would imply @xmath83 .",
    "it is the existence of this limit that allows the @xmath2 universe to fit the angular correlation function much better than @xmath3cdm , and we shall see shortly that the existence of this limit also alters the probability of seeing a low - multipole alignment of the cmb , rendering it statistically insignificant .    in the spirit of identifying the key elements of the theory responsible for the cmb fluctuations , without necessarily getting lost in the details of the complex treatment involving fluctuation growth on small and large scales , and the impact of transfer functions that link the observed temperature variations to the incipient density perturbations , we will here follow the same approach described in @xcite , which itself is based on simplified methods used in earlier applications @xcite .    noting that the sachs - wolfe effect dominates the fluctuation growth on scales larger than @xmath84 @xcite , it is not difficult to show that @xmath85 the variance in density over a particular comoving scale @xmath62 is given as @xmath86 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath87 is the power spectrum . not knowing the exact form of @xmath88 emerging from the non - linear growth prior to recombination",
    ", we will follow the approach outlined in @xcite and parametrize it as follows , @xmath89 where the ( unknown ) constant @xmath90 is expected to be @xmath91 . from eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 24 ) , we therefore see that @xmath92 where the definition of @xmath93 is analogous to that of @xmath77 in eq .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the sachs - wolfe temperature fluctuations follows the very simple form @xmath94 but only up to the maximum angle @xmath77 established earlier .    in comparing the angular correlation function @xmath6 resulting from this expression with",
    "that inferred from the wmap data , we found earlier that the general shape of @xmath6 depends only weakly on the chosen values of @xmath90 and @xmath95 . insofar as the large - scale fluctuations are concerned , therefore , the principal feature of the @xmath2 universe that distinguishes it from @xmath3cdm is the existence of the maximum angle @xmath77 .",
    "we anticipate that the outcome will be similar here if the two large - scale anomalies are indeed linked in this cosmology .    in fig .  1",
    ", we show three simulated renderings of the large - scale fluctuations in the cmb temperature using values of @xmath90 ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath95 ( @xmath97 ) indicated by our earlier fits to the angular correlation function .",
    "note that none of the effects thought to produce fluctuations on @xmath98 scales , such as acoustic oscillations and the various processes producing secondary signatures after decoupling ( see @xcite and references cited therein for a more complete discussion of all the relevant physical mechanisms ) , are included in these images .",
    "previous work has shown that these other processes are not directly relevant to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 multipole moments .",
    "the principal features evident in this figure are due solely to the sachs - wolfe effect , but strictly adhering to the restrictions imposed by eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 26 ) .    before entering into a quantitative statistical analysis of these simulated all - sky maps",
    ", it is quite evident even by eye that the general features emerging from the @xmath2 universe are reminiscent of those actually seen in the wmap data .",
    "note in particular the apparent  planarity \" of the fluctuations , and the emergence of  finger - like \" darker regions .",
    "the apparent planar - like arrangement of the octopole components was first noted by @xcite , but revisited by many authors since then . in the analysis of @xcite ,",
    "the probability of observing such a planarity within the context of the standard model is over @xmath99 , and therefore not statistically significant .",
    "nonetheless , it is comforting from the standpoint of the @xmath2 universe that this feature appears to be present most of the time .",
    "the finger - like depressions are more difficult to quantify , but were noted by @xcite .",
    "again , it is apparent from these simulations that such features are rather common in the @xmath2 universe .",
    "let us now examine how much impact the restricted range of fluctuation angles ( @xmath100 ) has on the distribution of @xmath101 . since the values of @xmath90 and @xmath95 were essentially identified from our study of the angular correlation function ,",
    "the principal unknown is the number @xmath102 of sachs - wolfe fluctuations across the sky .",
    "we have produced 20,000 simulated all - sky cmb maps for each assumed value of @xmath102 , ranging from 5 to 5,000 . a sample of these for @xmath103",
    "is shown in fig .  1 .    for each synthetic map , we followed the procedure outlined in  2 above , using the various techniques described in appendix a of @xcite to find the @xmath24 coefficients in the rotated frame . from these , we calculated the values of @xmath101 ( between the quadrupole and octopole moments ) and determined their occurrence rate .",
    "the corresponding relative probabilities are shown in fig .  2 , for @xmath104 5 , 20 , 50 , and 5,000 .",
    "mindful of the conclusions drawn by @xcite , in which the observed alignment angle appears to fall within the range @xmath38 , we have chosen to subdivide the results into increments of @xmath105 , so that the most likely value of the measured @xmath101 lies within the first bin .",
    "the probability distribution for a completely random occurrence of the angle @xmath101 corresponds to the light - grey bars in these diagrams , essentially the profile expected in the standard model .",
    "the probability of alignment within the first bin is the aforementioned value of @xmath106 , so the observed angle @xmath101 constitutes a marginally statistically significant anomaly .",
    "in contrast , the probabilities expected for the @xmath2 universe correspond to the black and dark - grey bars .",
    "notice that the overall probability distribution depends on how many fluctuations are included in the simulation .",
    "as @xmath102 increases to very large values , we approach the result expected for @xmath3cdm , presumably because this situation is similar to what one gets with a fluctuation spectrum inflated to very large scales early in the universe s history .",
    "absent inflation , however , the probability distribution is noticeably different , particularly for the smaller values of @xmath101 . even for @xmath102 as large as 50",
    ", a value of @xmath107 is expected to occur about @xmath108 of the time ",
    "higher for smaller fluctuation numbers @xmath102 . and for @xmath109 , this probability is approximately @xmath110 . in every case , the increase in fractional representation at smaller angles is compensated by the reduced representation at angles @xmath111 ( the dark - grey bars in these diagrams ) .",
    "these results suggest that a mutual alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments to within @xmath112 of each other does not appear to be statistically significant in the @xmath2 universe , as long as the number of sachs - wolfe fluctuations across the sky is smaller than several thousand .",
    "it was shown in a detailed analysis of the cmb large - scale anomalies @xcite that there is no statistically significant correlation in @xmath3cdm between the missing power on large angular scales and the alignment of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 multipoles .",
    "the inconsistency between the standard model and the wmap data is therefore even more glaring than each of the anomalies alone , because their combined statistical significance is equal to the product of their individual significances .",
    "simultaneous observation of the missing large - angle correlations with probability @xmath113 and alignments with probability @xmath114 is likely at the @xmath115 level .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , such an outcome clearly requires a causal explanation .",
    "the work presented in this paper , in combination with our earlier examination of the angular correlation function , offers a reasonable account for how both cmb low - multipole anomalies may arise .",
    "though not directly related , they nonetheless have a common origin in the @xmath2 universe  the existence of a maximum angular size @xmath77 for the large - scale fluctuations , imposed by the gravitational horizon @xmath41 at the time @xmath75 of last scattering .",
    "aside from the quantitative aspects of this analysis , a qualitative comparison between the simulated sky maps shown in fig .  1 , and the real universe as revealed by wmap , also suggests a morphological similarity between the two .",
    "we noted the appearance of  finger - like \" darkened extensions and the planarity of the octopole components which , however , are not statistically significant , even in the standard model .",
    "still , the weight of evidence  the angular correlation function , the lack of any statistical significance to the mutual alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments , and the morphological similarity between the real and simulated cmb maps  seems to favor the @xmath2 universe over @xmath3cdm .",
    "but clearly there is still work to do . by necessity ,",
    "our analysis of the angular correlation function and the low - multipole alignment has relied on a highly simplified treatment of the fluctuation growth in the early universe .",
    "it is well known , however , that there are many mechanisms producing density perturbations , on small and large scales , and there is a great deal of astrophysics linking these to the actual temperature variations we see across the sky .",
    "our approach here has merely shown promise in accounting for the observations .",
    "we can not be certain of the outcome until we have developed a more sophisticated treatment of the fluctuation growth in the @xmath2 universe , commensurate with the level of detail already incorporated into the standard model .",
