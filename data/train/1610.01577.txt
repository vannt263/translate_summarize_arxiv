    "the electrical conductivity of the half - metallic system is normally sum of the electrical conductivities of both spin channel .",
    "thus , the resultant electrical conductivity of the material can be expressed as,@xcite @xmath76 where , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the electrical conductivities of the spin - up and spin - dn channels , respectively . for 300 k",
    ", the value of @xmath36 equal to @xmath61.95 @xmath45 10@xmath79 @xmath59@xmath60m@xmath60 is obtained by considering the @xmath57 values as 0.1 @xmath1110@xmath12 and 0.66 @xmath1110@xmath12 seconds for spin - up and spin - dn channels , respectively .",
    "this calculated value of @xmath36 is found to be in good agreement with the experimentally observed value ( @xmath62 @xmath45 10@xmath79 @xmath59@xmath60m@xmath60).@xcite to the best of our knowledge , the experimental values of relaxation time and electrical conductivities in high - temperature region are not available for this compound .",
    "therefore , the comparison of adopted relaxation time and calculated values of electrical conductivities by using these relaxation time are not possible in the present study",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether the adopted values of relaxation time here are same to the experimental data of relaxation time and electrical conductivities or not .",
    "thus , the further study of high temperature electrical conductivities and relaxation times are desirable . +",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the temperature dependent thermopower of la@xmath1ba@xmath2coo@xmath3 compound in the temperature range 300 - 600 k. the value of @xmath0 at 300 k is found to be @xmath67 @xmath8v / k and remains almost constant up to 450 k. above 450 k , the value of @xmath0 increases with increase in temperature and reached to @xmath613 @xmath8v / k at 600 k. for the high - spin configuration of co@xmath80 and co@xmath5 ions , the value of @xmath0 estimated by heikes formula comes to be @xmath616 @xmath8v / k , which is close to the experimentally observed value at 600 k. the temperature dependent behavior of @xmath0 is studied by using the electronic structure calculations .",
    "the self consistency field calculation shows that la@xmath1ba@xmath2coo@xmath3 compound have ferromagnetic ground state structure .",
    "the large and positive value of @xmath0 obtained for the down spin channel is due to unique dispersion curve shown by the spin - dn channel .",
    "a good match between experimental and calculated values of @xmath0 in 300 - 600 k is obtained by taking into account of the temperature dependent values of relaxation time for both the channels . at 300 k ,",
    "the values of relaxation time used for up and down channels , 0.1 @xmath1110@xmath12 and 0.66 @xmath1110@xmath12 seconds also gives a very good match between calculated and experimentally reported value of electrical conductivity .",
    "thus , the consideration of temperature dependent relaxation time for both the spin - channel plays an important role in the understanding of te properties of this compound .",
