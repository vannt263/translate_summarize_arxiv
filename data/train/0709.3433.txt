    "spontaneous clustering of particles in granular gases has attracted much recent interest @xcite . as other pattern - forming instabilities ,",
    "the clustering instability of a freely cooling granular gas has served as a sensitive probe of theoretical modeling and , first of all , of the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics ( ghd ) .",
    "although the formal criteria of its validity may be quite restrictive , see below , ghd has a great power , sometimes far beyond its formal validity limits @xcite , in predicting a host of collective phenomena in granular flows , such as shocks , vortices and clusters .",
    "in the recent years , ghd has been applied to a variety of _ non - stationary _ dilute granular flows @xcite .",
    "non - stationary flows are both appealing and challenging for continuum modeling of granular dynamics .",
    "as in other areas of continuum modeling , this is especially true when a non - stationary flow develops a finite - time singularitiy @xcite .",
    "examples are provided by the finite - time blowup of the gas density : at zero gravity @xcite ( as described by the _ ideal _",
    "ghd discussed below , ighd from now on ) , and at finite gravity @xcite as described by the more complete , non - ideal ghd .",
    "of course , a density blowup in a gas with finite - size particles can only be an intermediate asymptotics , as the blowup is ultimately arrested : either by close - packing effects @xcite , or by the gradient - dependent transport @xcite .",
    "still , the attempted blowup regimes , signaling the development of high density regions in the gas , are fascinating and worth a detailed investigation .",
    "one such regime has been recently addressed by fouxon _",
    "they dealt with a macroscopically one - dimensional , freely cooling , dilute granular flow in the framework of ideal ghd that neglects the gradient - dependent transport effects : the heat diffusion and viscosity .",
    "_ derived a class of exact solutions to the ideal equations , for which an initially smooth flow develops a finite - time density blowup .",
    "close to the blowup time @xmath0 , the maximum gas density exhibits a power law behavior @xmath1 .",
    "the velocity gradient blows up as @xmath2 , whereas the velocity itself remains continuous and forms a cusp , rather than a shock discontinuity , at the singularity .",
    "the gas temperature vanishes at the singularity , but the pressure remains finite and almost constant .",
    "extensive numerical simulations with the ideal hydrodynamic equations showed that the singularity , exhibited by the exact solutions , is universal , as it develops for quite general initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the reason behind this universality is in the fact that the sound travel time through the region of the developing singularity is much shorter than the characteristic inelastic cooling time of the gas in that region . as a result",
    ", the pressure gradient ( almost ) vanishes in the singularity region , and the local features of this isobaric singularity become essentially independent of how the flow was initiated and how it behaves at large distances from the singularity .",
    "this singularity is of the same type as the one that develops , in the framework of the ighd equations , in a general _ low mach number _ flow of a freely cooling granular gas @xcite .",
    "here we perform molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of a freely cooling gas of nearly elastically colliding hard disks , aimed at identifying the  attempted \" density blowup regime , predicted by the ideal analytical solutions @xcite .",
    "we simulate a freely evolving dilute gas of nearly elastically colliding hard disks in a narrow channel with perfectly elastic side walls . in this geometry both the clustering mode in the transverse directions , and the shear mode",
    "are suppressed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed criteria ) . as a result ,",
    "the coarse - grained , or hydrodynamic flow depends only on the longitudinal coordinate along the channel ( and time ) , as it was assumed in refs .",
    "we choose the initial conditions of the md simulations so that the coarse - grained density , velocity and temperature fields are those producing one of the exact blowup solutions of the ideal ghd equations .",
    "then we follow the time history of the hydrodynamic fields in the md simulations and compare it with that predicted by the ideal exact solution and with numerical solutions of non - ideal ghd equations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly summarize the ideal ghd analysis @xcite of the density blowup : we present the ideal ghd equations , one of their exact solutions , its main features and expected limits of its validity . in section iii",
    "we describe our md simulations and compare the hydrodynamic quantities , computed from the simulations , with the exact solution of the ideal ghd equations .",
    "we find that the exact solution is in remarkable quantitative agreement with the md simulations over an extended time interval , proving the existence of the attempted density blowup regime . as the attempted singularity",
    "is approached , the hydrodynamic fields , as observed in the md simulations , deviate from the predictions of the exact solution . to investigate the mechanism of breakdown of the ideal solution",
    ", we extend the hydrodynamic theory , in section iv , in two separate ways . in the first one we take into account the gradient - dependent transport : the heat diffusion and viscosity , but continue to assume that the gas is dilute . in the second one we neglect the gradient - dependent transport but take into account , in a semi - phenomenological way , finite density corrections .",
    "section v summarizes our results and puts them into a more general context of hydrodynamic scenarios of clustering in freely evolving granular gases .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional granular gas of identical hard and smooth disks with diameter @xmath3 and mass set to unity , and adopt a simple model where the inelastic particle collisions are characterized by a constant coefficient of normal restitution @xmath4 . throughout this paper",
    "we will only deal with nearly elastic collisions , @xmath5 and assume a very small knudsen number : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the mean free path of the particles , and @xmath8 is the characteristic length scale of the hydrodynamic fields that may depend on time .",
    "in addition , we will assume in this section that the local gas density @xmath9 is much smaller than the close - packing density of disks @xmath10 : @xmath11 the strong inequalities ( [ secondineq ] ) and ( [ thirdineq ] ) need to be verified _ a posteriori _ , once the hydrodynamic problem in question is solved .",
    "the strong inequalities ( [ firstineq])-([thirdineq ] ) enable one to employ the well - established equations of navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) that deal with three coarse - grained fields : the mass density @xmath12 , the mean flow velocity @xmath13 and the granular temperature @xmath14 . in a sufficiently narrow channel",
    "these fields depend only on the longitudinal coordinate @xmath15 , and the hydrodynamic equations become @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",

    "( [ taul ] ) are chosen for convenience .",
    "we will keep identical notation for the rescaled and physical quantities , and take care that no confusion arises . using the rescaled quantities ,",
    "we rewrite eqs .",
    "( [ hydrodynamics1])-([hydrodynamics3 ] ) as @xmath29 let us assume that the characteristic magnitudes of the _ rescaled _ hydrodynamic fields , and of their spatial and temporal derivatives , are of order unity ( this assumption needs to be checked _ a posteriori _ )",
    ". then we can neglect the viscous and thermal conduction terms , as they scale as @xmath30 , and arrive at the ighd equations : @xmath31 these equations were investigated in refs.@xcite , where a family of exact analytic solutions was derived .",
    "here we will consider a representative and simple particular solution that evolves from the following initial conditions : @xmath32 to remind the reader , we are using rescaled variables here . back in the physical variables , the initial profiles are @xmath33,\\label{incond3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is defined in eq .",

    "the initial scale of variation of the fields , @xmath28 , is by a factor @xmath36 greater than the mean free path of the gas , justifying the use of the hydrodynamic description .",
    "furthermore , both the magnitudes , and the spatial scales of the _ rescaled _ fields are of order unity which justifies , at least for finite times , the use of the ideal equations ( [ a311 ] ) and ( [ a322 ] ) . figure  [ fig0 ] shows the initial density and velocity fields of the flow in the eulerian coordinate .    ) and ( [ incond3 ] ) ] versus the rescaled eulerian coordinate @xmath37 along the channel .",

    "e.g. _ @xcite . for the initial density profile ( [ initialconditions1 ] ) ,",
    "the eulerian coordinate @xmath15 is related to the lagrangian coordinate @xmath39 as follows : @xmath40 note that the infinite eulerian interval @xmath41 corresponds , in this example , to a finite interval of @xmath39 : @xmath42 , that is to a finite ( rescaled ) total mass of the gas , equal to @xmath43 . in the lagrangian",
    "coordinates , the ideal equations ( [ a311 ] ) and ( [ a322 ] ) are @xmath44 where the dilute gas pressure @xmath45 has been used instead of the temperature .",
    "the exact solution in the lagrangian coordinates is the following @xcite : @xmath46 as @xmath47 can be calculated explicitly @xcite , @xmath48 equations ( [ s2])-([disp ] ) describe the time history of the hydrodynamic fields in the @xmath15-coordinate in a closed parametric form .",
    "let us consider some important features of this simple exact solution",
    ".      a momentary look at the first of eqs .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) reveals that the density at the origin blows up in a finite time .",
    "back in the dimensional variables one obtains @xmath49 the gas temperature becomes zero at the singularity , the velocity gradient @xmath50 blows up as @xmath2 , whereas the velocity itself remains continuous and forms a cusp .",
    "this behavior at singularity is quite different from that of the _ free flow _",
    "singularity ( that one observes for the same initial velocity profile but a _ zero _ gas pressure ) .",
    "in particular , for the free flow singularity the density blows up as @xmath51 , while the velocity develops a shock discontinuity @xcite .",
    "@xcite for more differences between the two types of the singularities .",
    "it was found in refs .",
    "@xcite that the finite time blowup of the gas density and of the velocity gradient is not a consequence of specially chosen initial conditions .",
    "rather , it appears , in the framework of the ideal equations ( [ a311 ] ) and ( [ a322 ] ) [ or , equivalently , of eqs .",
    "( [ eqs1 ] ) and ( [ eqs2 ] ) ] , for quite general initial conditions . a robust local feature of this singularity is a finite , non - zero value of the gas pressure at the time of the density blowup .",
    "the singularity is universal because the sound travel time through it is much shorter than the characteristic inelastic cooling time of the gas . as a result , the pressure gradient ( almost ) vanishes in the singularity region , and the local features of this isobaric singularity become independent of the flow details at large distances .    as an infinite density",
    "can not be reached in a gas with finite - size particles , it is clear that , sufficiently close to the attempted singularity , some of the assumptions made on the way to the ideal equations ( [ a311])-([a322 ] ) break down .",
    "however , independently of the precise way of regularizing the infinite density , an attempted singularity implies the formation of a region with a very high density .",
    "furthermore , the ideal solution should accurately describe the evolution of the system for times not too close to the attempted density blowup time @xmath0 . before we look into where the ideal theory breaks down ,",
    "let us consider some _ global _ characteristics of the exact solution .",
    "for these the singularity time @xmath52 turns out not to be special .",

    "note that @xmath53 is independent of @xmath23 : for larger @xmath23 the initial density profile has a higher peak but a smaller width , so that @xmath53 remains constant .",

    "we also observe that @xmath52 is a regular point of @xmath60 , where nothing dramatic happens .",
    "note that the parabolic - in - time law of the energy decay is quite different from haff s law @xmath62 obtained for freely cooling _ homogeneous _ granular gas with density @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "for a one - dimensional flow , the applicability of the solution ( [ s2])-([disp ] ) is determined by the applicability of the ideal equations ( [ a311])-([a322 ] ) that it solves exactly .",
    "analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that , sufficiently close to the attempted singularity , the ideal equations become invalid .",
    "this happens because of one of two reasons ( or both ) : either the gas becomes dense , so that criterion ( [ thirdineq ] ) breaks down , or the heat diffusion becomes important , invalidating the ideal equations ( [ a311])-([a322 ] ) .",
    "the time @xmath63 at which the ideal theory breaks down can be estimated as follows @xcite : @xmath64 therefore , the  bottleneck \" for the validity of the equations is set by the initial conditions : if the maximum is determined by the first ( correspondingly , the second ) term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dominantmechanism ] ) , the ideal equations become invalid because of the finite gas density ( correspondingly , the finite heat diffusion ) . as each of the two terms",
    "is very small by assumption , the solution is expected to break down only close to the attempted singularity @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional solution may also become invalid because of instability with respect to small initial perturbations that are inevitably present in md simulations .",
    "numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations , reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , strongly suggest that the ideal solution is stable with respect to small _ longitudinal _ perturbations .",
    "this does not exclude possible instability with respect to small _ transverse _ perturbations .",
    "the only available analytic result here is the one obtained from the stability condition for a _ homogeneous _ cooling state , see refs .",
    "that stability criterion comes from a competition between the ( destabilizing ) inelastic cooling and the ( stabilizing ) heat diffusion and viscosity in the transverse direction .",
    "the stability criterion demands that @xmath55 be less than a threshold value depending on @xmath65 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 .",
    "the stability problem for the strongly inhomogeneous and time - dependent exact solution is obviously more complicated , and its complete analytic solution does not seem feasible .",
    "it is therefore important that our md simulations , presented in the next section , strongly suggest that , for sufficiently narrow channels , no instability in the transverse direction occurs for the time - dependent flow we are working with .",
    "let us summarize the main theoretical predictions .",

    "the relative importance of the two factors is determined , via eq .",
    "( [ dominantmechanism ] ) , by the initial conditions .",
    "to test the theoretical predictions , we performed md simulations of a free cooling granular gas in a narrow two - dimensional channel .",

    "the particles move freely until a collision ( `` event '' ) occurs when two disks @xmath71 and @xmath72 find themselves at a distance equal to @xmath3 .",
    "the collision is resolved instantaneously , leaving the positions of the particles unaltered and updating their velocities from @xmath73 , before the collision , to @xmath74 , after the collision .",
    "the update rule conserves the total momentum and reduces the total kinetic energy , with a constant coefficient of normal restitution @xmath75 $ ] : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the unit vector joining the centers of the two disks .",

    "in contrast , the numerical results from the nighd equations agree well with the md simulations and show that , as the attempted density blowup is approached , the heat conduction and viscosity effects can become important when the gas density is still small .",

    "let us put the results of this work into a more general context of clustering instability of a freely cooling granular flow .",
    "as we have already noted , the local properties of the density blow - up , exhibited by the exact solutions of the ighd equations , are the same as the local properties of the density blow - up exhibited by a _ low mach number _ flow of a freely cooling granular gas with the heat diffusion neglected @xcite .",
    "a low mach number flow emerges when the pressure balance sets in on a shorter time scale than the temperature balance . in this case",
    "any local inelastic cooling causes a ( low mach number ) gas inflow into the colder region so as to increase the local gas density there and keep the pressure gradient ( almost ) zero .",
    "the resulting density instability develops on the background of an ( almost ) homogeneous gas pressure .",
    "this is consistent with the md simulations presented here , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pr_0_900 ] , where the pressure in the vicinity of the density maximum hardly changes up to times very close to the attempted singularity time . for brevity",
    "we will call the low mach number flow instability scenario scenario 1 .",
    "scenario 1 first appeared in astrophysics and plasma physics in the context of condensation instabilities in gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation @xcite .",
    "as many as _ four _ additional hydrodynamic scenarios of clustering in a freely cooling granular gas have been discussed in the literature .",
    "we start with the _ pressure instability _ scenario , or scenario 2 .",
    "it was discussed , in the context of the granular clustering , by goldhirsch and zanetti @xcite , although it was also known earlier to the astrophysics and plasma physics communities , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "scenario 2 is usually presented in the following way .",
    "let us consider a small local increase in the gas density .",
    "this increase causes an increase in the collisional energy loss . as a result ,",
    "the gas pressure falls down , a gas inflow develops , causing a further density increase , and the process continues .",
    "importantly , scenario 2 assumes that the inelastic cooling time is much shorter than the sound travel time . in other words",
    ", it is the local temperature balance that sets in rapidly here , and the resulting pressure gradient drives the flow on a relatively slow time scale .    as of present",
    ", there has been no detailed nonlinear analysis behind scenario 2 .",
    "the ( well established ) linear stability theory of the homogeneous cooling state @xcite indicates that scenarios 1 and 2 operate in two opposite limits : for sufficiently short and long perturbation wavelengths , respectively .",
    "the physics behind this is the following .",
    "the characteristic cooling time due to the inelastic collisions is independent of the length scale of the initial perturbation , whereas the sound travel time scale is proportional to it . as a result ,",
    "when all other parameters are fixed , scenario 1 corresponds to an intermediate wavelength limit of the clustering instability , while scenario 2 corresponds to the long wavelength limit .",
    "( in the short wavelength limit the homogeneous cooling state of the gas is stable , as the clustering instability is suppressed by the heat diffusion @xcite . )",
    "now let us consider scenario 3 that also assumes a long - wavelength limit .",
    "as the gas temperature falls down rapidly because of the inelastic cooling , the flow is describable by the zero pressure ( or flow by inertia ) approximation @xcite . were it not regularized by close packing effects , such a flow would develop a finite - time density blowup ( of a different type than the low mach number flow ) @xcite . if the compressional heating interferes earlier than the close packing effects , the pressure becomes relevant again , and scenario 3 gives way to the scenario 1 @xcite . in the opposite case",
    "the late time dynamics of the system is describable by the burgers equation @xcite . which of the two regimes is realized in a particular setting depends on the initial conditions .",
    "scenarios 1 - 3 do not invoke the shear mode instability , and so they can operate both in one - dimensional , and multi - dimensional settings . on the contrary , scenarios 4 and 5",
    "do invoke the shear mode , and so they are intrinsically multi - dimensional ( and intrinsically non - linear ) .",
    "scenario 4 exploits the fact that the unstable shear mode may contribute , via a non - linear coupling , to the growth of the clustering mode .",
    "obviously , the nonlinear coupling is the _ only _ hydrodynamic mechanism of driving the clustering mode if the system size is larger than the critical size for the shear mode instability , but smaller than the critical size for the clustering mode instability .",
    "furthermore , numerical analysis , performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , indicated that the nonlinear coupling plays a dominant role in the initial density growth also in the case when the system size is _ comparable _ to the critical system sizes for the clustering and shear instabilities .",
    "( more precisely , the wave number of the monochromatic test perturbation of the transverse velocity in ref .",
    "@xcite was within the instability regions of both the shear , and the clustering modes .",
    "however , _ twice _ the wave number already came out of the instability region . )",
    "what happens in much larger systems is presently under investigation .",
    "it turns out that _",
    "well _ above the clustering mode instability threshold the nonlinear coupling with the shear mode does _ not _ dominate the density growth ( though it does make the theory more cumbersome ) . in the channel geometry , that we adopted in this paper and in the previous works @xcite ,",
    "the shear mode is suppressed , and the clustering instability develops in its pure and simplest form .",
    "now we proceed to scenario 5 @xcite that exploits the fact that the unstable shear mode _ heats _ the gas in some regions .",
    "scenario 5 assumes that this heating can be balanced by the inelastic energy loss , rendering ( quite a complicated ) steady state .",
    "it is furthermore assumed that this steady state is unstable with respect to small perturbations , and it is this instability that causes the granular clustering .",
    "we are unaware of a quantitative theory that would support scenario 5 , or of any quantitative test of scenario 5 in md simulations or in numerical solutions of hydrodynamic equations .    to complete the comparison of the five hydrodynamic scenarios of clustering we note that the only scenarios that have addressed , up to date , a strongly nonlinear stage of the clustering process _ quantitatively _ is the low mach number flow instability scenario ( scenario 1 ) @xcite and the zero pressure scenario ( scenario 3 ) @xcite .",
    "it is the consideration of a strongly nonlinear stage that enables one to identify attempted finite - time density blowups : prototypes of the dense granular clusters .",
    "which results of this work will withstand a generalization to more realistic granular flow conditions : for example , rotational degrees of freedom and tangential inelasticity of collisions ? including the rotational degrees of freedom and tangential inelasticity of collisions into a hydrodynamic description is possible under some limitations @xcite .",
    "solving the corresponding nonlinear hydrodynamic equations analytically will of course be beyond our reach .",
    "it is likely that , when the gradient - dependent transport is negligible , these nonlinear equations will again exhibit a finite - time density blowup .",
    "indeed , the development of closely packed granular clusters in a granular flow is a robust phenomenon .",
    "therefore , it is natural to conjecture , based on results of this work , that more realistic granular clusters ( those emerging when the rotational degrees of freedom are taken into account ) will still be describable as regularized attempted density blowups .    in summary ,",
    "the results of the present work gives support to the notion of a granular cluster as a regularized density blowup of ideal granular hydrodynamic equations , put forward in refs .",
    "@xcite . in more general terms , they present additional evidence that granular hydrodynamics is a powerful and accurate quantitative theory of granular flows , especially once it is employed within its limits of applicability but , luckily , sometimes even beyond them .    our work was supported by the italian miur ( prin grant n. 2005027808@xmath154003 ) , by the israel science foundation ( grant no .",
