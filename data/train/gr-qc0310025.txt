    "in the brane - world scenarios , our conventional universe is a 3-brane embedded in a higher dimensional space .",
    "while gravity can freely propagate in all dimensions , the standard matter particles and forces are confined to the 3-brane only [ 1 ] . in recent years",
    ", five - dimensional ( 5d ) brane cosmological models have received extensive studies [ 2 - 9 ] .",
    "it is noticed that one of the many interesting features of brane models concerns the big bang singularity : due to the existence of extra dimensions , the conventional big bang singularity could be removed .",
    "so the big bang is perhaps not the beginning of time but a transition from a pre - existing phase of the universe to the present expanding phase , and our universe may have existed for an infinite time prior to the putative big bang . in the ekpyrotic model [ 10 ] , it was suggested that the universe was produced from a collision between our brane and a bulk brane . in the cyclic model [ 11 ] , the universe undergoes an endless sequence of cosmic epochs that begin with a big bang and end in a big crunch . in the bounce models [ 7 - 9,12 - 14 ] , it was shown that the scale factor could evolve across a finite ( but non - zero ) minimum which represents a bounce ( as opposed to a bang ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the bounce property of brane models more generally .    in a previous paper [ 15 ] ,",
    "a five - dimensional big bounce cosmological solution with a _ non - compact _ fifth dimension was presented . by using this solution as valid in the bulk",
    ", a global brane model is derived in ref . [ 9 ] , in which the model has two 3-branes with the extra dimension compactified on an @xmath3 orbifold .",
    "this brane model is of the type of binetruy , deffayet and langlois [ 2,3 ] in which no cosmological constant was introduced in the bulk . in this paper",
    ", we are going to generalize it by adding a cosmological constant in the bulk , and then to study evolutions of the models .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we look for general solutions for cosmological models with two 3-branes and for three cases with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . in section iii",
    ", we study the gravitational force acted on a test particle in the vicinity of a brane and derive a stability condition . in section iv",
    ", we give several simple exact solutions as an illustration , and study the global evolutions and the stability of the brane models as well as the big bounce singularity .",
    "section v is a short discussion .",

    "note that there are different ways to express the solutions of above equations ( see , for example , [ 3 ] ) .",
    "here we follow our previous work [ 9,15,16 ] for convenience .",
    "we see that equation ( [ 5eing05 ] ) can be integrated once , giving@xmath28where @xmath29 is an arbitrary function . using this relation to eliminate @xmath30 from equation ( [ 5eing00 ] ) , we obtain@xmath31 a^{2}=2\\left ( \\mu ^{2}+k\\right ) \\;.",
    "\\label{5eing00b}\\]]also , with use of the relation ( [ b= ] ) , equation ( [ 5eing55 ] ) can then be integrated , giving@xmath32where @xmath33 is an integration `` constant '' which actually could be a function of @xmath11 .    in the bulk , the two equations ( [ 5eing00b ] ) and ( [ 5eing55b ] ) require that @xmath34 .",

    "we can easily extend it from bulk to branes and obtain a global two - brane solution .",
    "the @xmath3  symmetry requires that we firstly should write a bulk solution from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "then , according to israel s jump conditions , the two scale factors @xmath38 and @xmath39 are required to be continuous across the branes localized in @xmath40 . their first derivatives with respect to @xmath41 can be discontinuous across the branes . and",
    "their second derivatives with respect to @xmath11 can give a dirac delta function .",
    "thus the resulting terms with a delta function appearing in the lhs of equations ( [ 5eing00 ] ) and ( [ 5eing11 ] ) must be matched with the corresponding terms containing a delta function in the rhs of them in order to satisfy the field equations .",

    "generally speaking , brane models require the fifth dimension to be compactified to a small size @xmath86 .",
    "so a stable brane model should have a stable size .",
    "the well - known goldberger - wise mechanism [ 22 ] was to use a scalar field in the bulk to stabilize the size of the fifth dimension . in this way , the model has the tendency to recover it s size after a perturbation . here",
    ", a perturbation means a small change for the size .    here",
    "we wish to say that even if the size of the fifth dimension is somehow stabilized , one still can ask question whether particles on the brane may leave the brane and escape into the bulk .",
    "arkani - hamed et al [ 1 ] pointed out that in sufficiently hard collisions , particles on the brane can acquire momentum in the extra dimensions and escape from our 4d world , carrying away energy .",
    "if this happens continuously , it will cause another kind of instability problem . note that here the instability just means brane particles are not in a stable position along the fifth dimension . now",
    "a natural question is that once a particle left the brane , will it escape in the bulk forever or return to our brane again ?    to answer",
    "this question we noticed that the bulk discussed in this paper only contains a cosmological constant term @xmath87  and so is empty .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that particles inside the bulk should obey the 5d geodesic equation@xmath88which was used previously [ 18 ] for a similar purpose as here . from this equation",
    ", a 5d gravitational force acted on the bulk test particle can be defined as@xmath89for simplicity , we assume that the particle is temporary at rest in the bulk",
    ". then , along the fifth dimension , ( [ 5d - f ] ) gives@xmath90 in the vicinity of the @xmath22-th brane , we use the general results ( rhoi , pi ) and ( [ [ a]i ] ) in ( [ f^5 ] ) .",
    "then we obtain@xmath91if this force @xmath92 is attractive , i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the particle would be `` pulled '' back to our brane .",
    "thus we obtain a new kind of stability condition for the @xmath22-th brane as@xmath95    this is a reasonable condition which holds for ordinary matters including dark matter . however , if the brane matter contains a dark energy component such as a cosmological constant or quintessence , the condition ( stab - cond ) may or may not hold , depending on how much the dark energy is contained on the brane .",
    "for example , we let@xmath96where @xmath97 is a cosmological term on the @xmath22-th brane .",
    "then the condition ( [ stab - cond ] ) becomes@xmath98suppose initially condition ( [ stab - cond - bar ] ) holds , then , as the universe expands , both @xmath99 and @xmath100 decrease while @xmath101 keeps unchanged .",
    "so gradually the universe will enter in an unstable stage in which particles and energy on the brane may escape in the bulk and the 4d conservation law of energy ( [ rhoi - cons ] ) may not hold anymore .",
    "recent observations [ 19,20 ] reveal that presently we are living in an accelerating stage dominated by a dark energy term such as @xmath101  in ( [ stab - cond - bar ] ) .",
    "thus we see that both the acceleration of our universe and the unstable nature of the brane particles could be explained as due to the same repulsive force of dark energy . in the following section",
    "we will show that some brane models do not satisfy the condition ( [ stab - cond ] ) .",
    "in section ii we have obtained three types of global brane solutions corresponding to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . each type contains two arbitrary functions : @xmath29 and @xmath102 for type i , @xmath29 and @xmath70 for type ii , and @xmath29 and @xmath103 for type iii .",
    "all the two scale factors @xmath104 and @xmath105 and the densities @xmath106 and @xmath21 on the branes are expressed via the two functions . from the relation @xmath73 and metric ( [ 5metr ] )",
    "we see that the form of @xmath107 is invariant under an arbitrary coordinate transformation @xmath108 .",
    "this freedom could be used to fix one of the two arbitrary functions .",
    "another freedom may correspond , as is in the standard general relativity , to the unspecified equation of state of matter .",
    "so , generally speaking , if the matter content on the first brane is known , then the two arbitrary functions could be fixed",
    ". then the whole solutions could be fixed too .",
    "then we will know the matter content on the second brane .",
    "therefore , the brane solutions obtained in sec",
    ". ii are quite general .",
    "to compare these cosmological solutions with observations , we need know clearly the matter content on our brane .",
    "this may need careful analysis and might be complicated mathematically , and we are not going to do it here in this paper .",
    "however , as an illustration , we will pick up several simple exact models in the following and to exhibit typical features of brane cosmology .",
    "consider the @xmath0  brane solutions ( [ i - sol ] ) , for which we choose@xmath109where @xmath110 is a constant . in this way",

    "after this critical time , @xmath115  increases , implying the universe is expanding .",
    "for @xmath117 , we have @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and the universe evolves as if in the radiation - dominated standard friedmann model . before this critical time , the universe contracts from infinity .",
    "it was shown [ 9,21 ] that as the coordinate time @xmath27 varies from zero to @xmath121 , the proper time @xmath122 varies from @xmath123 to @xmath124 , where @xmath124 is a finite constant and corresponds to @xmath121 .",
    "thus we can call @xmath121 as to represent a big bounce ( as opposed to a big bang ) , and before this bounce the universe has existed for an infinitely long time .",
    "meanwhile , rather than the big bang singularity , which should correspond to @xmath125 , this big bounce singularity corresponds to @xmath126 . from the solution ( [ i - rho1spec ] )",
    "we can also see that as @xmath27 varies across @xmath121 , the energy density @xmath127 remains finite while the pressure @xmath128 changes from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "this implies a phase transition happened at the bounce .",
    "here we plot the evolution of the scale factor @xmath115 with @xmath131  in figure 1 .     in a @xmath132 brane cosmological model.,width=240,height=240 ]    the evolution of the second brane",
    "is similar as the first one with the bounce point at @xmath133 . from equation ( [ i - rho2spec ] )",
    "we see that whether the energy density on the second brane is positive or negative depends on the `` size '' of the fifth dimension @xmath86 . if @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 .",

    "an interesting special case is @xmath148 for which we have @xmath149 and the model is completely symmetric and particles on the branes are stable .",
    "the notion of an oscillatory universe can be traced back to 1930 s and has continued to attract interest [ 23 - 25,11 ] .",
    "tolman [ 23 ] discussed it within the framework of general relativity assuming a closed universe ( @xmath150 ) in which the universe undergoes a sequence of cycles of expansion and contraction .",
    "dicke and peebles [ 24 ] restudied tolman s model and pointed out that an oscillating universe could provide an escape from some of the cosmological problems such as the horizon and homogeneity problems .",
    "`` _ _ as the universe ages _",
    "_ '' , they wrote , `` _ _",
    "more and more of it becomes visible that earlier was beyond the horizon and presumably causally disconnected from us ....",
    "how then are we to understand the remarkable familiarity of the objects just appearing on the horizon ? perhaps by tracing the evolution back through the big bang to an earlier collapsing phase _ _ '' .",
    "however , tolman s oscillatory models were constrained by having to pass through the big bang singularity in which the energy density and temperature diverge .",
    "therefore , dicke and peebles expected that `` _ _ some future and better theory might show that the collapse of the universe would lead to a ` bounce ' instead of a singularity _ _ '' .",
    "now let us consider the type ii ( @xmath1 ) brane solutions .",
    "as we discussed at the beginning of this section that the metric form of @xmath107 is invariant under an arbitrary coordinate transformation @xmath151 .",
    "meanwhile , the scale factor @xmath104 in ( [ ii - sol ] ) contains two arbitrary functions @xmath29 and @xmath70 .",

    "this reminds us of the well - known entropy problem of the old oscillatory universe model .",
    "tolman [ 23 ] pointed out that if the total entropy of the universe can only increase , then , in an oscillatory model , the entropy produced during one cycle would add to the entropy produced in the next cycle , causing the oscillating amplitude of each cycle to be larger than the one before it . extrapolating backward in time",
    ", the universe would have to be finite cycles old .",
    "more discussions about the entropy problem can be found in literature [ 24,11 ] .",
    "we see that our oscillating universe model described by equation ( [ ii - aispec ] ) and figure 2 coincides with tolman s description perfectly and , therefore , could provide a realized framework to discuss the entropy problem .    the two equations ( [ ii - rho1p1 ] ) and ( [ ii - rho2p2 ] ) become@xmath162and@xmath163 -% \\frac{4\\sqrt{t^{2}-1}\\sin \\left ( \\pi t - y_{2}\\right ) } { a_{2}^{2}}\\;. \\label{ii - rho2spec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so the energy density on the branes changes sign periodically with time , implying that the universe may have a negative energy density .",
    "this is an unusual feature of the oscillatory brane model .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the size the fifth dimension is much smaller than the period of each cycle of the universe , i.e. , @xmath164 .",
    "then from equations ( ii - aispec ) - ( [ ii - rho2spec ] ) we find @xmath165 @xmath115 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "so if our brane has a positive energy density at present stage of the universe , the other brane would have a negative energy density . applying this in the stability condition ( [ stab - cond ] ) , we find that @xmath168 .",
    "this means that if one of the two branes is at a stable stage , the other one must be at an unstable stage . as a whole",

    "after the bounce , the universe expands to infinity again .     in a @xmath172 brane cosmological model.,width=240,height=240 ]    from equations ( [ iii - rho1p1 ] ) and ( [ iii - rho2p2 ] ) we obtain@xmath173and@xmath174thus the energy density is positive on the first brane and negative on the second brane .",
    "if we assume @xmath175 , then we have @xmath176 and @xmath167 .",
    "so probably we are living on the first brane .",
    "as for the stability condition ( [ stab - cond ] ) , we also have @xmath177 as in the above oscillating model .",
    "so particles in this model are also unstable .",
    "in this paper we have derived , in sec .",
    "ii , a class of five - dimensional cosmological solutions with two 3-branes and with the fifth dimension being static and compactified on a small circle .",
    "the bulk contains only a cosmological constant @xmath87 .",
    "it is found that for all the three cases of @xmath87 ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) the solutions contain two arbitrary functions of time .",
    "one of these two freedoms might be explained as due to the unspecified time coordinate in the 5d metric ( 5metr ) , leaving another to account for various contents of the cosmic matter . in section iii",
    "we have used the 5d geodesic equations to study the gravitational force acted on a test particle in the vicinity of a brane .",
    "this force could be interpreted as generated by matters on the brane . by requiring this force being attractive and so to grip particles from escaping into the bulk ,",
    "we have derived a physically reasonable gravitational stability condition as given in equation ( [ stab - cond ] ) . for illustration and for simplicity we presented three simple exact models in section iv by choosing the two arbitrary functions properly . from these simple models we found that the conventional space - time singularity `` big bang '' could be replaced in brane models by a matter singularity `` big bounce ''",
    "at which the `` size '' of the 3d space is finite and the energy density does not diverge , while the pressure diverges .",
    "this enable us to expect that in brane cosmological models the `` history '' of our universe could be traced back across the big bounce to a pre - existing phase .",
    "this is clearly of great interest and deserve more studies .",
    "the stability of brane particles of these simple models are also studied .    here",
    "we want to discuss more about the oscillating universe models given in equations ( [ ii - aspec ] ) - ( [ ii - rho2spec ] ) . as pointed out by tolman that an oscillatory model could resolve the horizon and the homogeneity problems .",
    "however , the main difficulty of tolman s oscillatory model is having to pass through the big bang space - time singularity .",
