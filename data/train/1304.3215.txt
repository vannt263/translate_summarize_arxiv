    "the casimir force @xcite is the force arising between objects placed in a quantum and/or thermal field due to the modification of the fluctuations of the field by the presence of the objects .",
    "as the force is due to a fluctuating field , the force itself should fluctuate .",
    "what is normally given as the casimir ( quantum or thermal due to the zero frequency matsubara mode ) force is its _ average _ value measured in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "deriving a fingerprint of the average force and fluctuations around the average force could aid identification of the casimir interaction component in an otherwise complicated experimental setup , showing long - range interactions of mixed origins @xcite .",
    "the first analysis of casimir force fluctuations pertains to the quantum context @xcite . in this case , despite the fact that the average value of the force is finite , the variance of the force exhibits an ultra - violet divergence that is eliminated using the experimental fact , that the force is always averaged over a time corresponding to the temporal sensibility of the experimental apparatus . from this analysis , while the average force on a single mirror is zero , its variance is non - zero , due to differences in the electric field on either side of the mirror .",
    "these fluctuations of the casimir force can in turn be related to the force exerted on a non - uniformly accelerating mirror @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fluctuations of the radiation pressure exerted by a laser beam on a conducting surface can also be analyzed @xcite , in this case calculations using the electromagnetic stress tensor can be confirmed by a kinetic like approach based on photon number fluctuations .",
    "casimir force fluctuations between perfectly conducting mirrors at finite temperature have also been examined @xcite and it was shown that the high temperature force could be derived from the classical rayleigh - jeans distribution , while the force fluctuations required a full quantum treatment before taking the classical limit . in all the above cases",
    "average forces and their fluctuations are seen to arise via the boundary conditions imposed by the conductor on the electromagnetic field . in @xcite fluctuations of the casimir - polder interaction between a polarizable atom and a perfect conductor",
    "were analyzed , presenting a conceptual departure from previous studies as force fluctuations can be related to a physical property of the atom , its polarizability , going beyond descriptions of objects in terms of ideal boundary conditions .    in @xcite",
    "the fluctuations of the thermal casimir force due to a free mass - less scalar field theory with dirichlet boundary conditions on parallel plates was considered .",
    "the leading term in the variance for two plates of area @xmath0 separated by a distance @xmath1 was shown to posses a cut - off dependent limit @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the temperature of the system , @xmath4 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath5 is a microscopic ( ultra - violet ) cut off .",
    "the average value of the force in this system behaves as @xmath6 .",
    "thus in terms of the extensive variable @xmath0 , the fluctuations of the force @xmath7 obey the usual thermodynamic scaling @xmath8 , compatible with the notion that local fluctuations of the force at distant regions of the plates are uncorrelated .",
    "similar results have also been found for the fluctuation induced forces on inclusions , such as proteins , in membranes @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite the fluctuation of the casimir force for scalar fields was examined in a parallel plate piston cylinder geometry , with the result that @xmath9 , which is clearly at variance with the thermodynamic scaling found in @xcite .",
    "whether thermodynamic scaling should hold is far from obvious as all the fluctuation induced interactions in the studies above are long range ( corresponding to mass - less field theories ) .    .",
    "the slit region is a vacuum . fluctuating thermal dipole configurations",
    "( shown bold and faint ) create a fluctuating thermal casimir interactions that for large @xmath1 decay to zero strictly with a probability one . ]",
    "connected with the question whether fluctuations in casimir forces scale thermodynamically , is the intriguing existence of fluctuating forces on isolated bodies , depending on a microscopic cut - off , as such forces should induce movement / diffusion of small inclusions and perhaps also fluctuation - induced drag forces , which have been predicted in a number of quantum @xcite and thermal @xcite situations .",
    "the theoretical results described above point to the existence of regimes , notably in microscopic systems , where fluctuations of measured casimir forces of both quantum @xcite as well as thermal or critical casimir provenience @xcite , can become large and thus may be experimentally measurable .    in @xcite",
    "a model dielectric was introduced , based on a continuous polarizable dipole field , showing thermal fluctuation forces identical to the zero frequency matsubara mode van der waals forces of the standard lifshitz theory with media of the same dielectric constants . within this model",
    "it is possible to analyze straightforwardly how the van der waals interaction arises from the correlations between dipoles in opposing slabs and how the van der waals force evolves temporally when switched on from zero , that is for initially uncorrelated slabs , to its final equilibrium value .",
    "here we use the very same model to study the fluctuations of the dipole - dipole induced thermal casimir force in the problem . because we analyze direct interaction between dipoles ,",
    "it is clear that as the distance between the two slabs is taken to infinity , the force itself must go to zero . in our model",
    "we only take into account the electromagnetic field generated by the dipoles in the slabs and ignore fluctuations of the electromagnetic field due to thermal photons ( which can not be properly included in the classical limit considered here @xcite ) .",
    "in this situation therefore , we do not expect a _",
    "cut - off dependent force fluctuation of the type mentioned above .",
    "we find that the average force scales as @xmath10 while the variance behaves as @xmath11 and tends to zero for infinitely distant bodies .",
    "we note that the variance obtained behaves like the @xmath1-dependent part of the variance found in @xcite .",
    "we consider a classical model of interacting dipoles introduced in @xcite . here",
    "we have two slabs of material separated by distance @xmath1 in the direction @xmath12 and the hamiltonian for the system is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a local dipole field .",
    "the interaction is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the local polarizability of the dipole field at the point @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the usual dipole dipole interaction . in slab",
    "@xmath19 we set @xmath20 ( for @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and we use a coordinate system such that the points in @xmath23 are in the half space @xmath24 @xmath25 and the points in the slab @xmath26 are in the half space @xmath27 : @xmath28 .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is then given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 indicates the gradient with respect the the coordinate @xmath17 , @xmath31 the gradient with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the vacuum green s function obeying .",
    "@xmath34    with this notation the dipole - dipole interaction is given by @xmath35    note that we have chosen the slabs to be separated by vacuum , so that there is no bulk pressure associated with the intervening dielectric medium , independent of the plate separation @xmath1 .",
    "the thermal casimir force usually given for such systems equals the plate area multiplied by a _ disjoining pressure _ , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference between the confined and bulk pressures , which tends asymptotically to zero as the plate separation increases .",
    "in the absence of sources , the average value of the dipole field is @xmath54 , and its correlation function at non - coinciding points is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the slab geometry green s function obeying @xmath57 the average force is thermodynamically given _ via _",

    "the second term is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ trick ] ) and ( [ corr ] ) as @xmath61\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\chi({\\bf x } ) \\chi({\\bf x}')\\nabla_i\\nabla_j ' g({\\bf x},{\\bf x}').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be further simplified using the fourier - bessel transform of the green s functions in the @xmath62 plane to get the remarkably simple formula @xmath63 the lateral fourier transform of the free green s function @xmath33 is given by @xmath64 while @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "this finally yields @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the polylogarithmic function defined by @xmath69 the standard result for the average value of the casimir force for this system is given by @xcite @xmath70 putting these results together in eq .",
    "( [ link ] ) finally yields @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the function @xmath73 is positive for @xmath74 $ ] , so that indeed the variance of the force fluctuations is everywhere positive .",
    "we see that the scaling of the fluctuations agrees with the @xmath1 dependent part in @xcite , but contains _ no bulk term _",
    "dependent on an ultra - violet cut - off .    the ratio of the variance to the squared average force is then given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 attains its maximum value @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "note the results are symmetric under the interchange of the labels @xmath80 and @xmath22 and thus the average force on each slab is equal and opposite and the force fluctuations on both slabs are the same .",
    "this has to be the case , as from the definition of the unaveraged force it is clear that the forces exerted on each of the slabs are symmetric .",
    "we analyzed a simple , classical dipole model , that leads to thermal van der waals interactions with the average force predicted by the standard lifshitz theory . in this classical dipole model the force at large separations not only goes to zero on the average , but much more stringently with probability one .",
    "the ratio of the variance to the squared average force , eq .",
    "( [ fingerprint ] ) , furthermore gives a _ fingerprint _ of the classical thermal van de waals interaction , differentiating it from possible parasitic effects and stray interactions , plaguing experiments in realistic systems @xcite .    in our dipole model",
    "there is no divergent cut - off dependent bulk contribution to the average force .",
    "the fact that no other length scale appears means that the functional form of the force variance in eq .",
    "( [ fluc ] ) can be predicted solely on the grounds of dimensional analysis and by assuming the thermodynamic scaling , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath81 for the fluctuations as a function of the area of the plates .",
    "the so obtained thermodynamic scaling is in agreement with a number of studies of fluctuations of casimir forces in both thermal and quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite are for thermally fluctuating fields , as here , but find a microscopic cut - off depend force fluctuations at infinite plate separation .",
    "nevertheless the average force has the same behavior in both models .",
    "this difference comes naturally from an underlying microscopic definition of the model . in our model the electrostatic fields",
    "are generated by the dipoles themselves , being solutions of the poisson equation for the given dipole distribution .",
    "the fields so generated can not generate self - forces on isolated objects , hence as the two slabs are separated the total force on each slab decays to zero and by consequence so does its mean and variance . in the model of @xcite ( and",
    "indeed its quantum counterparts @xcite ) , the fluctuating field exists throughout space and objects immersed in the field are not its sources .",
    "the objects immersed in the field however modify its fluctuations by the imposition of boundary conditions .",
    "crucially however , the fluctuating field exists in the presence of a single object and hence can exert a force , albeit of mean zero , on the object .",
    "intriguingly , the nature of force fluctuations may therefore be relevant to the long standing debate ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) as to the physical interpretation of the casimir effect in terms of a shift in zero point energy ( field effect ) or as a van der waals effect ( due to sources ) .",
    "it should be noted that fluctuations of the force acting on a single particle is compatible with the drag predicted on isolated moving objects coupled to a thermalized fluctuating field @xcite .    normally in electrostatics forces",
    "are evaluated by using the stress tensor @xcite that follows from equations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) , in order to compute forces generated by electric fields on charges and/or dipoles .",
    "the usual stress tensor given for dielectric systems depends on the local dielectric constant @xcite which is already an object derived from thermodynamic averaging , relating the _ average _ local polarization field to the local electric field .",
    "this means that the validity of the use of the preaveraged stress tensor to compute fluctuations of forces in these types of models is not obvious .",
    "the stress tensor before averaging is a fundamental object derived from the force exerted on charges by the electric field .",
    "it is indeed this stress tensor that should be used to compute force fluctuations .",
    "however , in many coarse grained theories used to describe fluctuating systems , dynamical variables , which are equivalent to charges or dipoles in electrostatic language , have been integrated out in formulating the theory and it is thus not always obvious that they contain sufficient physical information to yield correct predictions for force fluctuations .    0 m. kardar and r. golestanian , rev .",
