    "in the last decade or so , high - throughput searches for new materials have been gaining increasing interest as novel and rapid routes to find stable compounds .",
    "spurred by the increasing availability of large - scale computational resources as well as the rise of a number of materials databases , it has emerged as a rapidly evolving field of materials science .",
    "@xcite there already exist a number of computational materials repositories , including materials project ,  @xcite aflow library ,  @xcite open quantum materials database ,  @xcite computational materials repository ,  @xcite and the electronic structure project ,  @xcite to name a few .",
    "these databases offer opportunities for design and discovery of new materials based on data - mining and machine - learning approaches .    in recent years",
    "this high - throughput machinery has been employed in a number of studies to search for potentially stable oxides . using a combination of machine learning and first - principles calculations , hautier and co -",
    "workers have explored the possibility of finding `` nature s missing ternary oxides . ''",
    "@xcite high - throughput _ ab initio _ computations have also been used to evaluate another class of oxygen based compounds , namely phosphates , as lithium - ion battery cathodes .",
    "@xcite a systematic experimental investigation of high - throughput theoretical predictions and their structural characterization , which serves to validate the computational results , has also been performed for alkali carbonophosphate compounds .",
    "@xcite a computational search for @xmath0-type transparent conducting oxides has also been undertaken .",
    "@xcite very recently , cu , ag and au ternary oxides have been identified using a high - throughput search based on the minima hopping method .",
    "@xcite    in our searched chemical space of chosen cations and @xmath1 transition metals , more than two thousand three hundred oxides are listed in inorganic crystal structure database ( icsd ) , whereas only around three hundred and fifty selenides and sulfides have been reported . while significant effort has been devoted to high - throughput searches for oxides , comparatively little is known about the missing selenides and sulfides , and whether they might exist in as - yet empty ternary phases . in this contribution",
    "we take a first step along this direction for a number of ternary @xmath1 transition metal selenides and sulfides , by identifying , _ in silico _ , which of these can be stable . using a data - mining based ionic substitution model , in conjunction with density functional theory computations we study ternary systems of the form xyz , where the cation x= ba , ca , sr , la , k , bi , pb , y is a @xmath1 transition metal and z= s or se .",
    "there are 27 empty ternary phase diagrams with such a combination of elements . based on a bayesian likelihood estimate to minimize false negative predictions , we narrow down the search to 24 candidates .",
    "three of these candidates are very similar to misfit structures not present in the icsd .",
    "our predicted structures are similar , though not identical , to these disordered structures and within the framework of the ionic substitution model we only consider ordered structure types .",
    "we performed high - throughput experiments to synthesize the remaining candidates , using solid state and gas flow reactions .",
    "our experimental attempts resulted in only binary compounds for these systems .",
    "based on this combined theoretical and experimental study we conclude that the ternary compounds in these 27 phase diagrams , are not accessible via standard bulk synthesis methods .",
    "nevertheless , it is important for us to present their predicted proximity to stability , and document our experimental attempts , since other synthesis methods may produce these phases .",
    "we generated structures using the method of hautier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which ions are substituted into existing known crystal structures to form new compounds .",
    "the probability for such substitutions is obtained by constructing feature functions , which capture the key aspects of these replacements .",
    "feature functions are augmented by weights for substitutions , which are extracted from ternary and quaternary ionic compounds in the icsd .",
    "@xcite these are used to evaluate the probabilities and assign ranks to the generated structures . in this way , the ionic substitution method can generate likely structural candidates very quickly .    in the following we",
    "briefly summarize the main features of this model and refer the readers to ref .   for a more detailed exposition .",
    "the mathematical formulation of this model begins by representing any compound composed of ions , @xmath2 , ( @xmath3 ) as an @xmath4 component vector @xmath5 one then requires the probability , @xmath6 for two different compounds having the same number of components to exist in the same crystal structure .",
    "this is expressed as @xmath7 this probability function needs to be approximated . in the ionic substitution model",
    "this is achieved by using feature functions , @xmath8 , which capture the key aspects of the problem . a mathematical requirement for the feature function",
    "is that it should be defined on the domain of the sought probability function and should return either 0 or 1 .",
    "one can then approximate the probability function as @xmath9}{z},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the weight corresponding to feature @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is analogous to a partition function which ensures normalization of the probability function .",
    "an implicit assumption is that the feature functions do not depend on the number of ions , @xmath4 , in the compound , i.e. , ionic substitution rules do not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "then , one assumes that the probability of two ions to replace each other is the same regardless of other ions in the compound .",
    "this is implemented by considering only binary feature functions , which read @xmath13    every pair of ions @xmath14 is assigned feature functions of the above form .",
    "the corresponding weights , @xmath15 , indicate how likely is the @xmath16 binary substitution .",
    "these weights are obtained from the ternary and quaternary ionic compounds in the inorganic crystal structure database ( icsd ) .",
    "@xcite from this database , crystal similarities are then estimated using structure comparison algorithms .",
    "@xcite then , one can assign specific values @xmath17 to the vectors @xmath18 . for the full database this leads to @xmath19 using the above assignments ,",
    "the maximum - likelihood approach is then employed to estimate the vector of weights @xmath20 .",
    "the log - likelihood @xmath21 of the observed data is @xmath22.\\ ] ] the weights which maximize this log - likelihood , @xmath23 , are chosen as the weights for the probabilistic ionic substitution model .",
    "the ionic substitution method is particularly attractive for the problem we are considering , since we are interested in a survey over 27 previously empty phase diagrams .",
    "techniques that directly search for the minimum in the free energy landscape such as refs .  , while they may be preferable in terms of calculating the overall lowest energy structures , would be computationally prohibitive for this study .",
    "once we generated the candidate structures , we followed a multi - level strategy to assess the stability of these structures .",
    "the first level of filtering is obtained by choosing the one hundred candidate structures with highest probabilities assigned by the ionic substitution model . at the next step we performed density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for these selected candidates using quantum espresso package .",
    "@xcite we used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parameterization to the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "@xcite to replace the core electrons we used rappe - rabe - kaxiras - joannopoulos relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite all the candidate structures were relaxed until the forces on atoms were less than 0.01 ev /  and the pressure was less than 0.5 kbar .",
    "other computational parameters were chosen following the materials project , which have been shown to lead to total energies being converged to less than 5  mev / atom .",
    "@xcite for all calculations , we started with a ferromagnetic initialization of spins .",
    "finally , we constructed the phase diagrams by comparing the total energies for the candidate compounds with all known binaries and elements making up the compound .",
    "the total energies of elements and binaries were calculated with our calculation setup consistent with that for the ternaries .",
    "we used the tools available in python materials genomics ( pymatgen ) package to analyze the data .",
    "@xcite      structural phase diagrams require a high degree of accuracy , which dft calculations do not attain .",
    "for example , according to jain _ _ et al.__@xcite , the dft - calculated hull energies in the searched chemical space are close to normally distributed .",
    "only 40% of the 106 existing ternaries in the searched chemical space lie on the hull .",
    "ultimately , we wish to make a binary decision : we either attempt to synthesize a compound or not , based on the dft calculations .",
    "there are thus two potential errors one can make : false positive , in which a compound is suggested for synthesis and does not form , and false negative , in which a candidate compound is discarded but would have formed .",
    "we wish to consider the probability that a single structure is experimentally stable , given that the dft - calculated enthalpy of formation is @xmath24 relative to the known and proposed materials in the phase diagram . in this notation",
    ", we include all known compounds in the phase diagram , so that if @xmath24 is negative , we expect the candidate compound to be stable . using bayes theorem , we can write @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an enthalpy of formation cutoff that we will choose and @xmath27 means that the candidate compound is stable .    we can estimate the quantities as follows :    * @xmath28 : in a known phase diagram , the number of stable ternaries divided by the number of ternaries with @xmath29 * @xmath30 : for known stable ternaries , the number of materials with @xmath29 divided by the number of ternaries considered .",
    "this must be evaluated for all structures generated by the ionic substitution model .    to estimate the probabilities ,",
    "let us assume a gaussian distribution for @xmath30 with a standard deviation of 0.1 ev .",
    "we estimate @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the number of experimentally stable structures , while @xmath33 is the number of proposed structures with @xmath34 . here",
    "the proposed structures are the ones screened by the ionic substitution model .",
    "the estimates for @xmath33 and @xmath35 are obtained from ternary phase diagrams in the same chemical space which have known ternary compounds .",
    "we used the ionic substitution model and total energy calculations to estimate @xmath36 and @xmath37 structure / ev .",
    "@xmath38 controls the y - intercept of fig .",
    "[ fig : probability_model ] , and @xmath35 partially affects the slope . since @xmath38 and @xmath35 are the most uncertain values in this model , we have checked that the results are reasonably robust to their choice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probability_model ] . to demonstrate that our choices are reasonable",
    ", we display hull energies for sn - cu - s system from the materials project@xcite in fig .  [ fig : probability_model](b ) .",
    "our parameters also agree with extensive cross validation for known phase diagrams in the literature , such as that undertaken by hautier and coauthors  @xcite .",
    "when choosing @xmath26 , we need to consider both the false positive rate : @xmath39 and the false negative rate : @xmath40 estimated probabilities of false positive and false negative identifications are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probability_model ] , with varying cutoff , @xmath26 , and a choice of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . to avoid missing new compounds",
    ", we would like to minimize the likelihood of false negative predictions and we set @xmath43  ev .",
    "however , this means that our false positive rate ends up being quite large , or in other words the true positive rate would be low . for our choice of @xmath43  ev , the probability of true positive predictions is around 0.05 - 0.1 , depending on the values of @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "taking into account the errors associated with the prediction method our model allows us to estimate the false positive and false negative rates associated with our predictions .",
    "as we will report later in the paper , our high - throughput experiments find 3 out of the predicted 24 candidates to be stable .",
    "this ratio is close to our bayesian estimate of true positive predictions .",
    "this good agreement suggests that our bayesian model provides a reasonable framework to analyze the reliability of the prediction methods .",
    "it also provides insight that the inherent uncertainties in dft energies leads to a high false positive rate , if the cutoff is set so that the false negative rate is low .",
    "it also sheds light on the reason behind why many of the dft - predicted compounds were not synthesized in our experiments .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table_summary ]    our results for the candidate compounds are summarized in table  [ table_summary ] and their structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ collected_structures ] .",
    "we find that in nearly two - thirds of our predicted compounds , the transition metal is in four - fold coordination .",
    "these tetrahedra can be either edge sharing , vertex sharing , both edge as well as vertex sharing or can be isolated from each other . in the remaining compounds the transition metal - anion octahedra are edge sharing .",
    "we also observe that a number of compounds form one - dimensional chains . here",
    "we would like to make some general comparisons of our predicted class of compounds with the existing ternary systems within the same chemical space .",
    "a majority of compounds that we have predicted have metallic character according to dft - pbe ( sixteen out of a total of twenty four ) .",
    "this ratio is similar to that of the known ternaries with the same constituent elements , where nearly sixty compounds ( out of the existing 106 compounds ) have a zero band gap .",
    "however , pbe is known to underestimate band gaps , and these values should be taken with caution . among our predicted compounds ,",
    "fifteen have a magnetic moment greater than 0.05 @xmath44 per transition metal atom . in the existing ternaries",
    "the ratio of ones with magnetic moment is very similar , with nearly fifty five percent of the compounds showing a finite magnetic moment .",
    "crystallographic information files for all compounds is provided in the supplemental material .",
    "@xcite        we have also computed the enthalpies of formation of our candidate compounds including a correction which adjusts the energies of the elements to correct for the errors known to affect the values predicted by dft .",
    "we use the fitted elemental - phase reference energy ( fere ) correction proposed by stevanovic _",
    "et al_.  @xcite following these authors , we used the pbe+u method , using @xmath45 for cu and @xmath46 for all other @xmath1 transition metals .",
    "a comparison of the hull energies without and with the fere correction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hull_energy_fere ] . for most candidate compounds , the hull energies calculated without and with the correction are close enough to one another that we would not have changed our decision making process .",
    "a pronounced discrepancy appears for pb@xmath47fese@xmath48 because the fere correction for pb has not been reported and we , therefore , did not apply the correction for pb .",
    "varying the chemical potentials of different constituent elements provides an additional control knob and allows one to stabilize different compositions in the phase diagram .",
