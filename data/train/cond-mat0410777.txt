    "one of the most intriguing aspects of recently produced atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite is the ease with which two ( or more ) internal levels can be populated , in effect forming a spin-1/2 ( or spin-1 , etc . ) system .",
    "in particular , phase separation @xcite , vector solitons @xcite , two - component vortices @xcite , spin waves @xcite , breathe - together solutions @xcite and more general issues regarding the dynamics @xcite and stability @xcite in these systems have recently been investigated .",
    "two - component becs hold promise for a number of applications , including coherent storage and processing of optical fields @xcite using stopped light techniques @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of two - component becs is in general a difficult problem to study analytically , and much of the recent activity has focused on particular situations and thus made specific assumptions .",
    "for example , the relative interaction strengths ( via the binary collision scattering lengths ) for inter- and intra - component collisions are sometimes presumed to be equal , whereas in practice these scattering lengths vary and depend on the atom and the particular levels utilized .",
    "furthermore , these can be experimentally varied with feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "in other studies it is assumed there is little or no spatial variation in the relative density between the two components , restricting the applicability of these calculations to many cases of interest .",
    "for example , in stopped light experiments , a highly spatially dependent superposition of the two internal atomic states are generated by light pulses , and the dynamics of this inhomogenous superposition is essential in determining the information storage and processing capabilities of the system @xcite .",
    "the need for a simple understanding of dynamics in two - component becs free of such assumptions is the motivation for this work .",
    "we specifically consider the experimentally relevant situation of a single - component bec ( in an internal state labelled @xmath0 ) in its ground state , whose constituent atoms are suddenly put into spatially dependent superposition of two internal levels ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , with the @xmath1 condensate occupying a region inside the larger @xmath0 condensate . such a situation occurs with stopped light pulses @xcite or spatially dependent raman pulses .",
    "when such processes occur fast compared to the atomic dynamics ( millisecond timescales ) , the resulting two - component bec will initially have the same density profile as the original single - component bec .",
    "however , this is not a stationary state and will evolve .",
    "the evolution can be modelled with coupled gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations , where each component is described with a single macroscopic wave functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we find , remarkably , that the evolution of @xmath3 can often be described with an effective single - component gp equation , with the trapping potential and interaction coefficients renormalized by the fractional difference in scattering lengths .",
    "those these differences are generally small in practice , they end up dominating the motion of the wave functions . depending on their sign and magnitude ,",
    "our model predicts both trapping and repulsive effective potentials , as well as positive ( repelling ) or negative ( attractive ) effective scattering lengths for the @xmath1 condensate .",
    "the reduction to a single - component picture is accomplished by observing that the fluctuations of the total density are smaller and more quickly varying than the evolution of each individual component .",
    "we find an equation of motion for the total density fluctuations and find that , within certain limits , these fluctuations are described with a simple expression which we can plug into the equation of motion for @xmath3 and derive our effective one - component description . while we will perform our calculations with one - dimensional equations for computational simplicity , the results are equally valid and applicable in full three - dimensional geometries .    using our model ,",
    "much of the vast existing literature on single - component bec dynamics can be easily be applied to predict analogous behavior in two - component systems . to demonstrate this applicability , and test the accuracy of our model , we present calculations in several parameter regimes . for certain relative scattering lengths we get a repulsive effective nonlinearity in a trap . in this case",
    "a simple breathing motion occurs and the existing analytic results on collective excitations in single - component becs @xcite can be applied . in other cases , we get an attractive nonlinearity , in which case phase separation occurs and vector solitons form and propagate .",
    "our model again allows a mapping onto existing literature on the formation of soliton trains in single component becs @xcite which should improve abilities to design and analyze experiments to observe vector solitons , which have hitherto not been ovserved .",
    "we also note that the levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath6rb , used in many present day experiments @xcite , give rise to a vanishing effective nonlinearity , allowing us predict the evolution with a linear schroedinger equation .",
    "this should prove especially powerful in two and three dimensional cases , where it is computationally expensive to solve the full nonlinear differential equations .",
    "finally , we use our model to predict the existence of solutions whereby two overlapping condensates ( each with arbitrary number ) remain nearly stationary for very long times .",
    "these solutions can be thought of as generalizing previously discussed breathe - together solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions are relevant to observing spin squeezing @xcite and coherent optical storage @xcite in these systems .",

    "we are only accounting for dynamics in the the @xmath15 dimension , which is valid in an elongated trap geometry where the significant dynamics occur primarily in this dimension @xcite , and so choose an effective transverse area @xmath16 to give the correct nonlinearity .",
    "we will show how the relative difference in the scattering lengths are key parameters in the evolution and so define @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    for concreteness",

    "we have chosen @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "as we observe in the figure , each component undergoes non - trivial evolution of its density profile while the overall density profile ( which we define to be @xmath30 ) undergoes only very small fluctuations . to get a sense of the shape and magnitude of these small fluctuations ,",
    "the dot - dashed curves show the deviations from the original density profile , @xmath31 , blown up by the factor @xmath32 ( the reason for this particular case will become apparent later ) .",
    "one sees that at 15  ms a slight fluctuation in the total density has appeared in the region occupied by @xmath1 as well as near the condensate edges ( in such a way that the total atom number is conserved ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : breathex](b ) gives an overview of the evolution of the density profile @xmath27 and one sees that there is a breathing like behavior , with the width becoming larger and then smaller , as well as a small dipole sloshing due to its original offset from the trap center .",
    "figure  [ fig : breathex](c ) then shows the evolution of the density fluctuations @xmath25 and one observes two important features .",
    "first there is a pair of density perturbations travelling back and forth across the @xmath0 bec ( and reflecting at its boundaries ) , which , as we will see below , are travelling at the sound speed determined by the total bec density . in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : breathex](a ) , showing 15  ms and 45  ms , these waves are near the bec boundary whereas at 30  ms they are crossing in the region occupied by @xmath27 .",
    "second , there is a part which appears to be closely mimicking the much more slowly evolving profile of @xmath27 ( as also seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig : breathex](a ) plots ) .",
    "we now analytically investigate the coupled gp equations ( [ eq : gp2comp1]-[eq : gp2comp2 ] ) to learn how this particular pattern for the total density fluctuations arises .",
    "our strategy will be to eliminate the wavefunction @xmath2 in favor of a hydrodynamic description of the total density @xmath33 and total velocity field @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are the velocity fields of each component ( the @xmath36 denote the gradients of the phases of the wavefunctions @xmath37 ; we will use the prime symbol to indicate @xmath38 ) .",
    "we then linearize in the small density fluctuations @xmath25 and consequently small velocity field @xmath39 .",
    "our observation that @xmath25 evolves on a fast time scale relative to @xmath3 supplies an obvious separation of time scales in the problem and allows us to then solve for the evolution @xmath25 assuming @xmath3 is static on this time scale .    for convenience",

    "( [ eq : linhydroevol ] ) can be neglected relative to the first line .",
    "the result is an intuitively simple picture : the first term implies the density fluctuations obey a phonon - like dispersion term with usual sound speed in the condensate @xmath51 , while the remaining terms of the first line provide various source terms which seed these density fluctuations and are non - zero only in locations where there is a spin - excitation ( that is , where @xmath52 ) .",
    "these source terms occur both because of differences in the mean field interaction between the components as well as kinetic energy and quantum pressure in the two wavefunctions . because the spin dynamics are much slower than the sound speed propagation",

    "armed with this picture , we can now interpret fig .",
    "[ fig : breathex](c ) .",

    "ms and 45  ms the sound waves are primarily at the bec edge and this quasi - steady state solution dominates in the area of the spin - excitation . at 30",
    "ms , the sound waves are passing through the spin excitation region and are comparable to the quasi - steady state part . these sound waves end up having virtually no impact on the evolution of @xmath3 due to the fact that their evolution is on a completely different and independent time scale .",
    "stated another way , though the sound waves overlap @xmath3 each time they cross the bec , the contributions from each crossing tend to be out of phase and their net contribution to the evolution of @xmath3 washes out to nearly zero . on the other hand",

    "[ fig : stat](a ) we show a ground state of the effective one - component gp equation ( [ eq : psi2eff ] ) , obtained by propagating the equation in imaginary time , and holding the number of atoms in @xmath1 latexmath:[$n_2 = n \\int dz    @xmath71 is quite significant ( it dominates the kinetic energy @xmath69 in the ground state ) .",
    "the density @xmath61 is then chosen so that the total density @xmath23 corresponds the ground state of a pure @xmath0 condensate @xmath23 .    a time - dependent evolution of the full two - component eqs .  ( [ eq : gp2comp1]-[eq : gp2comp2 ] ) with this initial state",
    "then reveals that indeed this configuration is nearly stationary . the only observed motion is a small in - phase breathing of both components , with a magnitude governed by @xmath111 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stat](b ) shows the variations of the density @xmath27 from its initial value as a function of time , which exhibits this breathing motion .",
    "thus , not only is the motion of @xmath3 small , but the small deviations are approximately periodic and so @xmath27 remains near its initial value for very long times .",
    "the parameter @xmath106 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : stat](c ) and defined in the caption , characterizes the total deviation and is seen to be nearly periodic with a maximum amplitude of about 0.025 .",
    "we performed similar simulations for a variety of values @xmath112 and plotted the maximum @xmath106 reached in each case .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : stat](d ) . in the limit of small @xmath112 , where the nonlinearity is negligible",
    "the effective ground state is truly stationary .",
    "as the nonlinearity becomes more important , the ground state grows due to effective repulsive interactions , the small breathing motion occurs and we get the deviations @xmath106 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath106 saturates at around 0.025 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stat](d ) ) .",
    "the saturation occurs at the point the thomas - fermi solution @xcite of the effective one - component model becomes accurate .",
    "the saturation value should scale roughly linearly with @xmath113 .    in the regime @xmath114 , the effective ground state eventually becomes larger than the original condensate , in which case the present approach fails .",
    "however , in that limit , the solutions smoothly cross over into the breathe - together solutions discussed in @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have derived an equation of motion for the total density fluctuations in dynamic two - component condensates .",
    "we have then used this to derive an effective one - component gp equation ( [ eq : psi2eff ] ) for the smaller component , with effective potentials and interaction coefficients which depend in a simple way on the relative scattering lengths in the system .",
    "we have studied and tested the predictions of this model in both effective repulsive and attractive interactions .",
    "our model provides an intuitively simple way to predict the dynamics of two component becs and allow us to make correspondences to results already obtained for one - component becs .",
    "in particular , our model provides new insight on the dynamics of phase separation and the formation of vector solitons .",
    "we noted that magnetically trapped @xmath6rb provides a particularly interesting example in which the motion is governed by a simple linear schroedinger equation , allowing simple analytic predictions of motion in cases that would otherwise require solutions of the underlying nonlinear schroedinger equations .",
    "finally , we have applied it to predict the existence of quasi - stationary two - component configurations .",
    "these solutions promise to be useful for applications involving information storage using stopped light as well as inducing spin squeezing in these systems .",
    "a combination of these two techniques may provide a new technique to generate squeezed light .",
