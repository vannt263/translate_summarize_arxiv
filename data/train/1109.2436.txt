    "once heated and accelerated on the shock , produce different types of emission : thermal with maximum intensity in x - rays and nonthermal emission in radio , x - rays and @xmath0-rays . experiments in high - energy astronomy observe all types of these emission .    most of galactic cosmic rays are believed to be produced by the forward shocks in supernova remnants ( snrs ) . a number of indirect evidences favor this expectation .",
    "in particular , efficient proton acceleration changes the structure of the shock front and makes plasma more compressible that leads to lower adiabatic index , to increased shock compression ratio and to some observed effects : reduced physical separation between the forward shock and the `` contact discontinuity '' ( or reverse shock ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or even protrusions of the ejecta clumps beyond the forward shock @xcite ; concave shape of the energy spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; growth of some turbulence modes and amplification of magnetic field in the pre - shock region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; `` blinking ''",
    "x - ray spots originated from such growth of magnetic field @xcite ; ordered non - thermal x - ray strips @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is still luck of direct observational confirmations that protons are accelerated in snrs to energies which make them responsible for @xmath0-ray emission of snrs .",
    "broadband spectra of a number of snrs may be explained either by leptonic or hadronic scenario for @xmath0-ray emission ( e.g. sn  1006 : * ? ? ?",
    "fermi @xmath0-ray observatory is expected to clarify such ambiguity , at least in bright snrs ( as in rx  j1713.7 - 3946 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any case , other kind of experimental information should be studied as well .",
    "namely , the distribution of surface brightness in different bands caused by emission of accelerated particles in snrs contains wealth of information about properties of crs and magnetic fields in these objects .",
    "a well known example is the method to estimate the strength of the post - shock magnetic field from the thickness of the radial profiles of x - ray brightness ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "radial structure of the shock front upstream ( observed in x - rays ) seems to confirm back - reaction of particles and magnetic field amplification , locally , in sn  1006 @xcite .",
    "a method to derive an aspect angle ( between ambient magnetic field and the line of sight ) in snr from the azimuthal variation of the radio brightness is developed in @xcite and applied to sn  1006 under assumption of the uniform interstellar magnetic field ( ismf ) .",
    "more detailed consideration of the azimuthal radio profile including the ismf nonuniformity results in constraints on orientation of ismf and its gradient around sn  1006 @xcite .",
    "radial profiles of the radio brightness may constrain the time evolution of the electron injection efficiency @xcite .",

    "numerical models for synthesis of maps of adiabatic snrs in uniform interstellar medium ( ism ) and uniform ismf from basic theoretical principles as well as approximate analytical descriptions are developed in these papers .",
    "the main factors determining the azimuthal and radial variation of surface brightness of snrs are determined .",
    "the role of the nonuniform ism and/or nonuniform ismf in nonthermal images of snrs are studied by @xcite ; in particular , gradients of ismf strength or ism density result in several types of asymmetries in surface brightness distributions of snrs in radio , hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands . these papers are limited to the test - particle approach because the non - linear theory of diffusive acceleration is not developed for shocks of different obliquity , while the obliquity dependence of various parameters is crucial in image modeling .",
    "in addition to the analysis of snr images simulated from basic theoretical principles , model - independent methods for snr images are important .",
    "such method for synthesis of the inverse - compton @xmath0-ray map of snr from the radio ( or hard x - ray ) image and results of the spatially resolved x - ray spectral analysis is developed and applied to sn  1006 in @xcite .",
    "it is found that synthesized inverse - compton @xmath0-ray image of sn  1006 is in agreement with hess observations .",
    "this fact favors a leptonic scenario for the tev @xmath0-ray emission of this snr .",
    "further development of this method allows us to find a new way to constrain the strength of magnetic field in sn  1006 from its nonthermal images @xcite .    though a leptonic scenario for @xmath0-rays from sn  1006 is reasonable and promising ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , a hadronic origin can not be ruled out even in view of the small ism densities ( upper limit is @xmath1 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are consistent with a hadronic scenario @xcite .",
    "the shape of the observed spectrum in the tev @xmath0-ray range better corresponds to the hadronic spectrum rather then to leptonic one @xcite . in order to fit the observed radio , x - ray and gamma - ray emission within the leptonic scenario one needs rather high downstream magnetic field @xmath2 @xcite ; there is a general thought that such a field can only be produced by efficiently accelerated cosmic ray proton component .",
    "if tev @xmath0-rays from sn  1006 is of hadronic origin , then the observed brightness map of this snr in @xmath0-rays with energy @xmath3 should reflects the distribution of protons with energies @xmath4 which interact with shocked thermal protons inside snr .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study this possibility modeling @xmath0-ray images of a sedov snr in uniform ism and uniform ismf it would have under such scenario .",
    "though we are primarily interested in comparison with sn  1006 , our results are general and may be used for analysis of other snrs .",
    "our model closely restores model used in papers i and ii . let us consider an adiabatic snr in uniform ism and uniform ismf .",

    ", an analysis of known snr images presents some hints against such scenario @xcite ; it also reveals that properties of snr images are similar in isotropic ( no dependence on obliquity ) and quasi - perpendicular ( injection prefers perpendicular shock ) approaches . in our calculations ,",

    "namely , the obliquity dependence of the normalization @xmath12 ( which is proportional to the injection efficiency ) is parameterized by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is given by the following formulae where different ` sensitivity ' to the obliquity angle is given by the parameter @xmath24 .",

    "magnetic field appears in the hadronic @xmath0-rays only through dependence ( if any ) of the injection efficiency and the maximum energy on the shock obliquity .",

    "it is merit to note that our approximate formula reflects also some effects of the non - linear acceleration theory .",

    "features on images are radially thinner for smaller @xmath0 . eventual amplification of magnetic field would be accounted through the larger magnetic field compression ratio ; however , this ratio does not appear in our formulae because the hadronic images of snrs do not depend on the strength of magnetic field .",

    "however , it is unlikely that quite symmetrical bilateral structure ( as in sn  1006 ) may appear due to nonuniformity of ism density because the structure of ism should be quite special ( like a tube , which is not observed around sn  1006 ) .    bilateral pattern in hadronic image of the shell - like snr",
