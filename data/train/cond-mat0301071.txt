    "the origin of strong ferromagnetic order observed in some solids has long been a mystery in physical science .",
    "after heisenberg @xcite , it became clear that the ultimate origin of ferromagnetism lies in a subtle interplay between quantum many - body effects and strong coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "to provide convincing derivations of ferromagnetism in concrete models of many electrons , however , remained unsolved ( even on a heuristic level ) for a long time .",
    "the problem is difficult because neither quantum many - body effects , nor the coulomb interaction alone favors ferromagnetism ( or any magnetic ordering ) .",
    "one must deal with an interplay of both the factors .",
    "moreover , the intrinsically nonperturbative nature of the phenomenon makes the problem almost impossible to attack within conventional perturbative methods in condensed matter physics . a generic many - electron system without interactions",
    "is known to have a paramagnetic ground state , a phenomenon known as pauli paramagnetism . in order to destabilize pauli paramagnetism and stabilize ferromagnetism , one must have a sufficiently large interaction .",
    "for example , a heuristic argument due to stoner implies the criterion that @xmath0 is necessary to stabilize ferromagnetism , where @xmath1 is the on - site coulomb interaction and @xmath2 is the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "this is the well - known `` competition '' between quantum dynamics and coulomb interaction .    in the present paper ,",
    "we describe our constructive and mathematically rigorous approach to the origin of ferromagnetism .",
    "this is a continuation of the series of works @xcite , and the main result of the present paper was described in @xcite for a special one - dimensional model . here _",
    "we present a class of hubbard models in any dimensions with a finite density of states ( at the fermi level ) and finite interactions , and prove that their ground states are ferromagnetic . _",
    "combined with our earlier work @xcite , this provides _ a class of nonsingular models of itinerant electrons ( with only spin - independent interactions ) in which low energy behaviors ( i.e. , the nature of the ground states and the low - lying excitations ) are rigorously proved to be those expected in ferromagnetic insulators_. we hope that the present work becomes a starting point of further investigations of deep interplay between quantum dynamics and nonlinear interactions in strongly interacting quantum many - body systems .",
    "the present paper is written in a nearly self - contained manner . in section  [ s :",
    "hubdef ] , we give the definition of the hubbard model . in section  [ s :",
    "rferro ] , we briefly review rigorous results about ferromagnetism in the hubbard model , and motivate the present paper . in section  [ s :",

    "the reader who is interested in the new physical results is invited to start from this section . in section  [",
    "s : main ] , which is the main section of the paper , we define our models in the most general setting and state our conclusions precisely .",
    "final section  [ s : proof ] is devoted to the proof of the main theorem .",
    "the hubbard model is a standard simple model of interacting itinerant electrons in a solid .",
    "although this model is too idealized to be regarded as a quantitatively reliable model of real solids , it contains physically essential features of interacting itinerant electron systems .",
    "it is expected to exhibit various phenomena including antiferromagnetism , ferromagnetism , ferrimagnetism , superconductivity , and metal - insulator transition .",
    "some ( but not all ) of these phenomena have been treated rigorously in some cases @xcite .    in the present section ,",
    "we define the hubbard model in the general setting , and fix our notation .",
    "we leave details and backgrounds to more careful reviews ( such as @xcite ) and present only the minimum necessary ingredients .",

    "sites_. a site represents an atomic orbit in a solid .    for each @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", we define the creation and the annihilation operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 for an electron at site @xmath9 with spin @xmath10 .",
    "these operators satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath11 and @xmath12 for any @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",

    "let @xmath17 be a normalized vector state which satisfies @xmath18 for any @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "physically @xmath17 corresponds to a state where there are no electrons in the system .",
    "then for arbitrary subsets @xmath19 , we define a state @xmath20 in which sites in @xmath21 are occupied by up - spin electrons and sites in @xmath22 by down - spin electrons .",
    "the hilbert space for the system with @xmath23 electrons is spanned by the basis states ( [ eq : basis ] ) with all subsets @xmath24 and @xmath25 such that denotes the number of elements in a set @xmath26 . ]",

    "we finally define total spin operators @xmath28 by @xmath29 for @xmath30 , 2 , and 3 . here",
    "@xmath31 are the pauli matrices defined by @xmath32 the operators @xmath33 are the generators of @xmath34 rotations of the total spin angular momentum of the system . as usual",
    "we denote the eigenvalue of @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "the maximum possible value of @xmath37 is @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "the model is characterized by the hopping amplitudes @xmath40 defined for all @xmath41 , and the magnitude @xmath42 of the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "physically , @xmath43 represents the quantum mechanical amplitude for an electron to hop from the site @xmath44 to site @xmath9 when @xmath45 , and the on - site potential when @xmath46 .",
    "usually @xmath43 is non - negligible only when the two sites @xmath9 and @xmath44 are close to each other .",
    "we then define the general hubbard hamiltonian as @xmath47 here the first term describes quantum mechanical motion of electrons which hop around the lattice according to the amplitude @xmath43 .",
    "the second term represents nonlinear interactions between electrons .",
    "there is an increase in energy by @xmath42 for each doubly occupied site , i.e. , a site which is occupied by both up - spin electron and down - spin electron .",
    "this is a highly idealized treatment of the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian which consists only of the first term in ( [ eq : genh ] ) describes the free tight - binding electron model .",
    "it is not very difficult to analyze this model especially when the hopping amplitude @xmath43 has a translation invariance .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in the states in which electrons behave as `` waves . ''",
    "the hamiltonian which consists only of the second term in ( [ eq : genh ] ) is also easy to study .",
    "the hamiltonian is already diagonalized in the basis states ( [ eq : basis ] ) , in which electrons behave as `` particles . ''    when both the first and the second terms in ( [ eq : genh ] ) are present , a `` competition '' between wave - like nature and particle - like nature of electrons takes place .",
    "the competition generates rich nontrivial phenomena including ferromagnetism .",
    "to investigate these phenomena is a main motivation in the study of the hubbard model .",
    "in the present section , we formulate the problem of saturated ferromagnetism in the hubbard model .",
    "we then give a brief review of the rigorous results about ferromagnetism in the hubbard model , and explain background of the present work .",
    "for more careful reviews , see @xcite .",
    "it is easily shown that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : genh ] ) commutes with the total spin operators @xmath48 .",
    "therefore one can look for simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath49 and @xmath35 .",
    "when all the ground states of the hamiltonian @xmath49 ( with a fixed electron number @xmath39 ) are eigenstate of @xmath35 with @xmath50 , we say that the model exhibits _",
    "saturated ferromagnetism_. this is the strongest form of ferromagnetism since @xmath38 is the maximum possible value for @xmath37 .",
    "the first rigorous and nontrivial result about saturated ferromagnetism in the hubbard model is due to nagaoka @xcite and to thouless @xcite .",
    "it was proved that the hubbard model on a class of lattices ( which includes most of the standard lattices in two and three dimensions ) with @xmath51 exhibits saturated ferromagnetism when @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in other words",
    "the model is not allowed to have any doubly occupied sites , and there is only one site without an electron .",
    "the ferromagnetism of nagaoka and thouless is quite important since it showed for the first time that the hubbard model can generate ferromagnetism through nontrivial interplay between quantum dynamics and coulomb interaction .",
    "subsequent studies , however , have suggested that their mechanism of ferromagnetism is restricted to special situation with infinite @xmath1 and a single hole .",
    "see section  4 of @xcite for a modern proof and further discussions .      in 1989 , after more than two decades from the works of nagaoka and thouless , lieb proved an important theorem for the hubbard model with @xmath54 ( i.e. , half - filling ) on a bipartite lattice @xcite . for the hubbard model with @xmath42 on lattices which have two sublattices with different numbers of sites",
    ", lieb s theorem implies the existence of ferrimagnetism , a weaker version of ferromagnetism .",
    "a typical example is the hubbard model on the so called copper oxide lattice of fig .  [",
    "f : cuo ] , where the ground states are proved to have @xmath55 when @xmath54 . the models exhibiting lieb s ferrimagnetism have peculiar single - electron band structures where the band at the middle of the spectrum is completely flat ( or dispersionless ) .",
    "one may regard lieb s ferrimagnetism as a precursor to the flat - band ferromagnetism that we shall discuss .",
    "flat - band ferromagnetism was discovered first by mielke @xcite and then by tasaki @xcite .",
    "mielke treated the hubbard model on a general line graph , where @xmath56 for those pairs @xmath57 corresponding to the edges ( or bonds ) of the lattice , and @xmath58 otherwise .",
    "the models have peculiar band structure where the lowest single - electron band is completely flat .",
    "mielke proved that the models with @xmath42 exhibit saturated ferromagnetism for suitable electron numbers which correspond to the half - filling of the lowest bands . a typical example ( and the most beautiful example of flat - band ferromagnetism ) is the hubbard model on the kagom lattice of fig.[f : kagome ] , which was proved to exhibit saturated ferromagnetism when @xmath59 .",
    "see also @xcite for mielke s results on hubbard models with partially flat bands .",
    "tasaki @xcite proposed his version of hubbard models with flat lowest bands , and proved the existence of saturated ferromagnetism for @xmath42 when the lowest bands are half - filled . as can be seen from the one - dimensional example in fig .",
    "[ f:1dflat ] , his models have two different kinds of lattice sites which are sometimes interpreted as metallic and oxide atoms , and have next nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes . by fine - tuning the hopping amplitudes and the on - site potentials ,",
    "the lowest band becomes flat .",
    "see @xcite for an extension .",
    "a common feature of lieb s ferrimagnetism and mielke s and tasaki s ferromagnetism is that their models have single - electron bands which are totally flat ( i.e. , dispersionless ) , and the magnetization is supported by electrons in the flat bands .",
    "( for lieb s ferrimagnetism , the latter statement is correct only in a vague sense . )",
    "this observation is consistent with the stoner criterion which states that large @xmath60 favors ferromagnetism . here",
    "the criterion is realized by infinitely large density of states @xmath2 .",
    "the works of lieb , mielke , and tasaki have shown that rich classes of hubbard models on slightly complicated lattices exhibit nontrivial magnetic behavior .",
    "such a view may be helpful in understanding insulating ferromagnetism observed in a cuprate @xcite , and has even motivated some scientists to design novel ferromagnetic materials .",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "but one should not forget that the hubbard model is a highly idealized model .",
    "to find implications of the results for the hubbard model in realistic many - electron systems defined in continuum space is a formidably difficult but a challenging problem .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "although lieb s ferrimagnetism and mielke s and tasaki s flat - band ferromagnetism certainly have shed novel light on the mechanisms of magnetic ordering in interacting electron systems , they do not deal with the true `` competition '' between quantum dynamics and coulomb interactions .",
    "when the coulomb interaction @xmath1 is vanishing , all of their models have highly degenerate ground states .",
    "the degeneracy reflects the existence of completely flat bands . among these degenerate ground states for @xmath61 ,",
    "there are ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic states as well as states with much smaller magnetization .",
    "the role of the coulomb interaction in these models is simply to lift the huge degeneracy and `` select '' the states with highest magnetization as unique ground states .",
    "consequently ferrimagnetism or ferromagnetism in these models takes place for any values of @xmath42 . in other words",
    "magnetic ordering is stabilized by infinitesimally small coulomb interaction .",
    "this is quite different from situations in realistic systems where the interaction must be greater than some positive critical value in order to destabilize pauli paramagnetism and get magnetic ordering",
    ".    it may be needless to say that the existence of completely flat lowest bands ( especially in tasaki s models ) is unrealistic , or even pathological .",
    "the flatness of the bands is destroyed by arbitrarily small generic perturbation , and is far from robust .",
    "it was therefore highly desirable to go beyond flat band models .",
    "a natural step was to modify the model by adding extra hopping terms to the hamiltonian thus making the flat band dispersive , and then to show that the magnetic ordering survives .",
    "one can only hope this scenario to work for sufficiently large @xmath1 since magnetic ordering becomes truly a nonperturbative phenomenon when the band is not flat .    as the first step in this direction , the local stability of the ferromagnetic state was proved in models obtained by adding arbitrary small short - range hopping terms to tasaki s version of flat - band hubbard models @xcite . in this work",
    ", it was also shown that low - lying excitation energy above the ferromagnetic state has the dispersion relation expected for a magnon excitation .",
    "then it was proved in @xcite that a one - dimensional hubbard model with non - flat bands exhibits saturated ferromagnetism for sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "the model was obtained by adding extra nearest neighbor hopping terms to tasaki s one - dimensional flat - band hubbard model as in fig .",
    "[ f:1dnf ] .",
    "this was the first rigorous example of ferromagnetism in an electron system without any singularities , i.e. , with finite interaction and finite density of states .",
    "shen @xcite announced a computer assisted extension of the proof in @xcite to some higher dimensional models .",
    "the method in @xcite inspired similar rigorous works in different classes of hubbard models @xcite .",
    "in particular tanaka and ueda @xcite recently succeeded in proving the existence of saturated ferromagnetism in a hubbard model obtained by adding extra hopping terms to mielke s flat band hubbard model on the kagom lattice . for closely related heuristic works ,",
    "see @xcite and other references in section  6.6 of @xcite .",
    "the present work is an extension of that in @xcite .",
    "we extend the theorem in @xcite to general models in higher dimensions .",
    "as was noted in @xcite , a straightforward extension of the method in @xcite applies to a class of higher dimensional models .",
    "instead of using such a method , we here present a much more general and simplified proof which naturally covers a more general class of models .",
    "in the present section , we concentrate on a simple class of models defined on decorated hypercubic lattices , and precisely describe the results of the present paper and our previous works .",
    "although our works cover much more general models , it may be useful for the readers to see what has been achieved in the context of simple models .",
    "in short , we start from a concretely defined non - singular model of itinerant electrons , and prove that its low energy properties coincide with what one expects in a `` healthy '' ferromagnet .",

    "reflecting the special geometry of the decorated lattice , the intermediate bands with @xmath81 are always dispersionless .",
    "this , however , is not crucial to low energy behavior of our model .",
    "indeed it is not difficult to add proper extra hopping terms to the model to make all the bands dispersive while maintaining the existence of ferromagnetism .",

    "we consider the hubbard model with the hamiltonian ( [ eq : genh ] ) , the hopping amplitudes ( [ eq : ttrs ] ) , and the electron number @xmath82 .",

    "<S> we introduce a class of hubbard models in any dimensions which are nonsingular in the sense that both the coulomb interaction and the density of states ( at the fermi level ) are finite . </S>",
    "<S> we then prove that the ground states of the models exhibit saturated ferromagnetism , i.e. , have maximum total spins . </S>",
    "<S> combined with our earlier results , the present work provides nonsingular models of itinerant electrons with only spin - independent interactions where low energy behaviors are proved to be that of a `` healthy '' ferromagnetic insulator .    to appear in commun . </S>",
