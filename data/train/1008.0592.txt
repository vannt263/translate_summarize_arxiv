    "the castor @xcite calorimeter , illustrated on figure [ fig : castor ] , is located 14.37 m from the cms interaction point and extends the forward rapidity coverage to the region @xmath0 .",
    "r0.5        castor presents a sandwich structure of tungsten ( w ) absorber plates and quartz plates as active material .",
    "it has an octagonal cylinder shape with an inner radius of 3.7 cm , an outer radius of 14 cm and a total depth of 10.3 @xmath1 .",
    "the collection of the signal is based on the production of erenkov photons which are transmitted to photomultiplier tubes through aircore lightguides , the w and quartz plates being inclined by 45 w.r.t . the beam axis to optimize the photon yield .",
    "the castor calorimeter is divided in an electromagnetic section of 20.12 @xmath2 and an hadronic section of 9.5 @xmath1 .",
    "it has a 16-fold azimuthal segmentation in towers and a 14-fold longitudinal segmentation in sections , from which the 2 first are electromagnetic and the 12 remaining hadronic .",
    "it has no segmentation in @xmath3 and consists therefore in a total of 224 channels .",
    "castor has just been submitted to final tests in beam and installed inside of the cms cavern at respectively the beginning and the end of this month of june 2009 .",
    "+ the zero degree calorimeters @xcite ( zdcs ) , illustrated on figure [ fig : zdc ] , are located 140 m from the interaction point in both the forward and backward directions .",
    "they enable to measure neutral particles produced at @xmath4 and possess a full acceptance to measure neutral energy flow in the region @xmath5 .",
    "the zdcs are also based on the production and detection of erenkov photons to build the calorimeter signal and present as castor a sandwich structure of w plates as absorber and quartz fibers as active material .",
    "r0.5    each of the zdc calorimeters is divided in an electromagnetic section of 19 @xmath2 and an hadronic section of 5.6  @xmath1 .",
    "the electromagnetic section has a 5-fold horizontal segmentation to measure the pseudorapidity of the forward energy deposits , while the hadronic section has a 4-fold longitudinal segmentation .",
    "the zdcs were already integrated into cms for the 2008 first lhc run .",
    "the theoretical description of @xmath6 collisions at high energies involves the use of matrix elements ( me ) associated to the hard scattering and parton showers ( ps ) linking the scattered partons with the final - state hadrons .",
    "the me can be computed exactly at a given fixed order of the perturbative qcd expansion and for given values of the hard scale @xmath7 and bjrken variable @xmath8 , while the ps takes into account higher order contributions by resuming a subset of leading diagrams at each order .",
    "the subset of leading diagrams considered depends on the values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 and various models exist to describe the ps evolution in the different phase - space regions .",
    "r0.5        the interest of forward physics to study the ps evolution comes from the fact that the differences between the predictions of the various models are more prominent in the forward region .",
    "the dglap @xcite evolution equations as implemented in pythia @xcite and for which the gluon ladder is ordered in @xmath9 predict ps in which the softest emissions are the ones closest to the proton remnant direction , while the bfkl @xcite evolution equations for which the gluon ladder is ordered in @xmath8 without any @xmath9 ordering or the color dipole model ( cdm ) as implemented in ariadne @xcite and in which the emissions are generated by color dipoles radiating independently predict arbitrarily large forward emissions as long as allowed by the kinematics .",
    "the measurement of multi - jet events with a forward jet in castor is therefore an important tool to distinguish between the various models and to study the ps dynamics beyond the standard direct dglap approximation .",
    "this is illustrated on figure [ fig : fwdjeth1 ] by the h1 results relative to the study of forward jet production in deep inelastic scattering at hera @xcite .",
    "the data are compared to the qcd monte carlo models rapgap @xcite and ariadne @xcite , which respectively uses the dglap evolution equations and the color dipole model to describe the parton shower . +",
    "the study of the distribution of the pseudorapidity separation between jets , @xmath10 , in multi - jet events with a forward jet in castor , would also enable to distinguish between the various ps models . by selecting events with different @xmath10 topologies",
    ", one can indeed look at the breaking of the @xmath9 ordering at different places along the gluon ladder .",
    "one can for example enhance the available phase - space in @xmath8 for bfkl - type radiations by looking to events with a forward jet in castor and a central dijet system @xcite .",
    "+ the castor calorimeter can also be used to measure mueller - navelet dijet events @xcite in which a jet is detected in each of the forward directions .",
    "this process is characterized by the presence of two hard scales - the transverse momentum of the two jets - which leads to a suppression of the emissions ordered in @xmath9 as described by the dglap equation .",
    "it is also characterized by a large rapidity interval between the two jets of the dijet system , which leads to an enhancement of the bfkl - type radiations .",
    "the measurement of mueller - navelet dijet events is therefore well suited to access the dynamics beyond dglap , particularly through the study of the azimuthal decorrelation @xmath11 between the two jets of the system @xcite .",
    "+         the feasibility to reconstruct forward jets in castor has been studied by the antwerpen and desy groups .",
    "the results presented here have been obtained by albert knutsson and correspond to a generator level study based on ariadne .",
    "the jets are defined at generator level according to the inclusive @xmath9 algorithm and at castor level according to a simplified approach by considering 16 sectors in @xmath12 and summing the energy longitudinally in each of these sectors .",
    "the azimuthal angle of the jet at castor level is then given by the azimuthal angle of the highest energetic sector , while the energy of the jet is given by the energy of the highest energetic sector to which the energies of the two neighboring ones are added .",
    "one has to emphasize that no detector effects are taken into account .",
    "the correlation between the energy and the azimuthal angle of the jet at generated level and castor level is shown on figure [ fig : knutsson ] and found to be reasonably good .",
    "the underlying event ( ue ) , defined as everything except the hard scattering component of a collision , is an unavoidable background which has direct implications on measurements at the lhc .",
    "it affects for example the jet reconstruction and the isolation cuts .",
    "the ue receives contributions from the initial and final state radiation ( gluon emissions ) , from the beam remnants ( particles coming from the proton break - up ) and from the multiple parton interactions ( mpi ) which correspond to additional softer parton scatterings .",
    "if from an experimental point of view , it is impossible to separate the ue from the hard component , the topological structure of a @xmath6 collision however enables to define observables which are sensitive to the ue , like the average sum of charged particles transverse momentum in the transverse region w.r.t . the leading jet direction .",
    "the problem in the understanding of the ue at the lhc comes from the fact that different mpi models tuned to describe equally well tevatron data for the above observable give very different predictions when extrapolated at the lhc energy @xcite .",
    "the mpi occurring between the spectator partons , they strongly affect the forward energy flow and the measurement of energy deposit in castor could therefore be sensitive to the various mpi models .",
    "the mpi induced correlation between the activities in the forward and central regions could furthermore be studied by looking at the charged particles multiplicities as a function of @xmath3 for different energy deposits in castor . figure [ fig :",
    "correlation ] illustrates such a study on the basis of a generator level analysis of inclusive qcd processes made with pythia for several mpi tunes @xcite .",
    "diffractive @xmath6 interactions , for which one or both protons stay intact , enable to study the perturbative qcd and the hadron structure through the measurement of the cross sections for diffractive jet , @xmath13 , @xmath14 or heavy quark production .",
    "diffraction also enables to study mpi and soft rescattering through the extraction of the rapidity gap survival probability .",
    "diffractive processes will be selected at cms by rejecting events with a forward activity in the hadron forward ( hf ) and castor calorimeters .",
    "the use of castor could yield in particular to an improved rejection of non - diffractive processes , while the zdcs could be used to reduce the diffractive dissociation background @xcite .",
    "the zdcs being fast enough to give an answer at the level 1 trigger , they could be used online to select the diffractive events and to reject the diffractive dissociation background .",
    "the zdcs also plan to measure the correlation between the neutral forward energy flow and the particle multiplicity in the central region .",
    "the measurement of the forward neutron production by the zdcs could lead in particular to a better constraint on the low @xmath8 part of the gluon pdf and the ultra high energy cosmic rays models @xcite .",
    "the zdcs could finally monitor the luminosity of the beam by looking at @xmath6 bremsstrahlung events and forward neutron production .",
    "the forward calorimeters castor and zdcs are planed to play an important role in the study of forward physics with the cms detector at the lhc .",
    "their program , extending from forward jet production to diffraction , could enable to measure a wide variety of observables .",
    "i would like to thank my colleagues of the cms forward physics analysis group for the comments , discussions and for providing the results presented in these proceedings .",
