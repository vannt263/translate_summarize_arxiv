    "it was proposed by the atlas collaboration to use gaas strip detectors as a part of the inner tracker at lhc because of the good radiation resistance to fast neutron irradiation up to 4@xmath010@xmath1 n @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the high hadron radiation levels with fluences in the range of 10@xmath3 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 in the forward region of the atlas inner detector will effect the main parameters for the operation of the gaas detectors : leakage current density , space charge density , mean free drift length and charge collection efficiency . in the first part of this paper we discuss the radiation level for the gaas wheels ( r=26 - 32.7 cm , z=85 - 170 cm)@xcite and calculate the hardness factors for the integrated neutron and proton spectra .",
    "then an attempt is made to estimate the 1 mev neutron equivalent fluence for a ten year lhc operation . in the second part",
    "we summarize damage functions deduced experimentally from pad detectors irradiated in the isis spallation neutron source at the rutherford appleton laboratory@xcite and with 24 gev / c protons at the proton synchrotron ( cern ) .",
    "the radiation levels for the atlas inner detector have been calculated by a.ferrari@xcite using the fluka code with dtujet .",
    "table 1 summarizes the expected hadron radiation fluences assuming a p - p cross section of 80 mb and a maximum luminosity of 1.0@xmath010@xmath6 @xmath2 s@xmath5 ( operating time 10@xmath7 s per year ) for the lhc . for the following",
    "we assume that the charged hadron fluences only consists of pions and protons .",
    ".mean , peak energy and fluences ( 10 years operation ) of hadron radiation level at the position of the gaas wheels ( r = 30 cm ) in the atlas inner detector . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the pad detectors , for investigation of radiation hardness , are schottky diodes made on semi - insulating gaas with a thickness of 200 @xmath8 m and a diameter of 2 or 3 mm .",
    "the contacts and substrates are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the detectors were irradiated using neutrons ( isis ) and 23 gev protons ( cern ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the leakage current density as a function of @xmath91mev , n@xmath10 .",
    "we observe for high ohmic material a slight increase of the leakage current density to a value of 30 na / mm@xmath11 at 20@xmath12c and for medium ohmic material a decrease down to the same value .",
    "this means the leakage current density after ten year lhc operation is independent of the value before irradiation and small in comparison to si pad detectors @xcite .",
    "the typical behavior of the mip signal height ( @xmath13sr - source ) of irradiated pad detectors is an exponential decrease down to about 4000 e@xmath14 for an equivalent fluence of 1.3@xmath1510@xmath16 @xmath2 ( e.g. wafer mcp90 figure 3 ) . for the measurements we used a bias voltage of 200",
    "v and a shaping time of 500 ns . to investigate this behavior we determined the mean free drift lengths by irradiating the detector from the front and backside with alpha particles ( @xmath17am ) . the charge collection efficiency ( cce )",
    "is then given by @xmath18 + \\frac{\\lambda _ h}d\\left [ 1-\\exp \\left ( -\\frac{x_0}{\\lambda _ h}% \\right ) \\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the drift lengths of electrons and holes , @xmath21 the detector thickness and @xmath22 represents the generation point of electron hole pairs .",
    "we assume that the mean free drift length is independent of the position within the detector . in any case",
    "this is valid for electrons because of the saturation of the drift velocity at electric fields higher than 10@xmath23 v / cm . for holes",
    "we observe a plateau of the cce for bias voltages higher than 200 v @xcite which indicates also a saturation of the hole drift length .",
    "figure 4 shows the mean free drift length of electrons and holes ( 20 @xmath12c , 300 v bias ) as a function of the 1 mev equivalent neutron fluence for diodes from wafer fr41 .",
    "we observe a strong decrease of the mean free drift length for both carriers down to 32 @xmath8 m for electrons and 22 @xmath8 m for holes .",
    "a comparison of different materials shows that there is a dependence of the electron mean free drift length on the resistivity .",
    "the material with the lowest resistivity shows for all irradiation levels the highest electron mean free drift length but is still going down to about 36 @xmath8 m ( figure 5 ) .",
    "cv - measurements have shown that the space charge density decreases with increasing irradiation @xcite .",
    "figure 6 plots shows corresponding bias voltage to make the detector full active .",
    "this voltage decreases for diodes on wafer fr76 from 250 v down to 10 v after ten years of lhc operation .",
    "the calculation of the hardness factors of the proton and neutron spectra and the estimation for pions result in a 1 mev neutron equivalent fluence of 1.75@xmath1510@xmath16 @xmath2 at r = 30 cm in the atlas inner detector for ten years of lhc operation .",
    "therefore we expect at 20 @xmath12c for the gaas detectors leakage current density of 30 na / mm@xmath11 independent of the resistivity of the semi - insulating gaas substrates .",
    "this value is low in comparison to silicon detectors .",
    "also the voltage to make the detector fully active is smaller than 200 v. the signal loss due to trapping and the reduction of the carrier mobility is a severe problem . but the signal height of pad and strip detectors are not the same , because of the different weighting fields . a concept proposed by th.schmid et al .",
    "@xcite predicts for a strip detector with special bias a signal height of 7000 e@xmath24 considering only the electrons with a mean free drift length of 40 @xmath25 m after ten years of lhc operation .",
    "we are grateful to m.edwards ( ral ) and f.lemeilleur ( cern ) for the help with the irradiation .",
    "we also thank a.ferrari for providing the data of the radiation levels in the atlas inner detector .",
    "this work has been supported by the bmbf under contract 057fr11i ."
