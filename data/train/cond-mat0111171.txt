    "in this paper i will review some very simple dynamical models whose dynamics slow down with time . along with this , some typical length scale in the system grows .",
    "these two features are referred to as ` glassy dynamics ' and ` coarsening ' respectively .",
    "anomalous coarsening refers to the situation where a length scale grows more slowly with time than the usual power law dependence . in this introduction",
    "i will briefly review these topics and their interconnections .",
    "then in the later sections i will describe in detail two models that exhibit anomalous coarsening and glassy dynamics .",
    "the appealing feature of the models to be discussed is that although they exhibit non - trivial behaviour they are simple enough to analyse and gain a firm understanding of . in sections  2,3",
    "i will summarise these analyses .",
    "although the choice of models to be reviewed reflects personal research interests , i believe that the two models studied in sections  2 and 3 are each representative of a class of systems . to bring this out i try to make connections to other related models in sections 2.5 and 3.8 . finally , in section  4 , i return to the relation between glassy dynamics and coarsening .      the phenomenolgy of glassy systems is well established ",
    "see @xcite for excellent reviews .",
    "experimentally , the archetypal system is a liquid that , when cooled rapidly to temperatures where the equilibrium state should be a crystalline solid , becomes trapped in metastable liquid - like configurations .",
    "thus the higher temperature configurations are frozen in and one can meaningfully say that the glass is like a frozen liquid .",
    "three distinguishing features of the glassy state are the long relaxation times , stretched exponential decay of correlation functions ( see equation  3 below ) and ageing phenomena@xcite whereby since the system is out of thermal equilibrium it evolves continuously as time goes by and time - translational invariance is lacking .",
    "this phenomenology provides a mandate for theoretical study .",
    "the long relaxation times , that show a non - arrhenius divergence as the temperature @xmath0 is lowered are often fitted experimentally by the vogel - tammann - fulcher ( vtf ) law @xmath1\\;. \\label{vtf}\\ ] ] the relaxation time @xmath2 may characterise , for example , the time for an externally imposed stress to relax .",
    "although some heuristic justifications have been offered @xcite , for practical purposes vtf is just a fit with three parameters @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 reduces to an arrhenius law .",
    "a system for which @xmath5 is small , so that one has something close to arrhenius behaviour , is referred to as a ` strong glass ' , whereas a system exhibiting large deviations from arrhenius behaviour is referred to as a ` fragile glass ' .",
    "generally , @xmath5 is much lower than the experimental temperatures so although there is a singularity in the fit , it is not physically relevant",
    ". nevertheless it should be noted that there has been a long debate concerning whether @xmath5 represents a true thermodynamic transition temperature achievable in the limit of infinitely slow cooling .    on the other hand , other alternative functional forms for relaxation times @xmath6",
    "have been proposed that do not exhibit singularities at any finite @xmath0 . among these ,",
    "the exponential inverse temperature squared ( eits ) form @xmath7 ( where the constant is positive ) is popular .",
    "experimentally , it is difficult to distinguish between vf and eits behaviour due to obvious limitations on the longest accessible timescales ; both can represent the experimentally observed @xmath6 in many materials  @xcite .",
    "stretched exponential decay of correlation functions , let us say an autocorrelation @xmath8 , is expressed by the kohlrauch - williams - watt law @xmath9 \\label{strexp}\\ ] ] where the stretching exponent @xmath10 .",
    "an heuristic explanation for this law is to postulate a broad distribution @xmath11 of relaxation modes with decay constants @xmath2 yielding @xmath12 if one assumes @xmath13 then for large @xmath14 a poor man s saddle point argument implies that the dominant modes have @xmath15 which leads to ( [ strexp ] ) with @xmath16",
    ". however the question remains as to how the broad distribution of modes @xmath11 comes about .",
    "one idea that was proposed to generate a broad distribution of relaxation times was of a hierarchy of degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "the different levels in the hierarchy then relax in serial , the degrees of freedom in one level having to wait for the degrees of freedom in the level above to reach some configuration before they are free to evolve .",
    "this latter condition is a realisation of a _",
    "dynamical constraint_.    a more concrete realisation of a dynamical constraint in a system with just one set of degrees of freedom is the @xmath17-spin facilitated kinetic ising models introduced by fredrickson and anderson @xcite-@xcite .",
    "that model comprises non - interacting ising spins in a downwards pointing field .",
    "however a spin can only flip if at least @xmath17 nearest neighbour spins are pointing up ( against the field ) .",
    "this gives rise to slow cooperative relaxation .",
    "a modification of this model is to have anisotropic dynamical constraints @xcite@xcite . in the one - dimensional version",
    "which we will refer to as the asymmetric constrained ising chain ( acic ) a spin can flip down only if its left neighbour is pointing up . as we shall show in section  [ acic ] , although the equilibrium distribution is the boltzmann distribution , the relaxation to equilibrium is strongly affected by the asymmetric constraint .",
    "thus when quenching from high temperature to low temperature the equilibrium distribution implies that most spins should be pointing down .",
    "however for a spin to flip down its neighbour has to point up .",
    "thus there is an energy barrier for isolated up - spins to flip up that is related to the size of the domains of down - spins separating these up - spins ( this will be quantified in section  [ acic ] ) .",
    "as the system gets closer to equilibrium these domains become longer and the energy barriers increase .",
    "thus the dynamic slows down .",
    "dynamical constraints can also induce ` entropy barriers ' . in this case",
    "there are no energy barriers to relaxation , rather one can imagine special configurations or small doors in the phase space that the system must pass through to allow it to relax .",
    "these doors are found through random exploration of the phase space .",
    "however , as the relaxation proceeds the doors become progressively fewer and harder to find .",
    "one example of such a system is the backgammon model@xcite .",
    "finally one should contrast the idea of energy ( or free energy ) barriers induced by dynamical constraints with energy barriers induced by disorder .",
    "it is well known that in a disordered system , where there is competition between different quenched random interactions , one can have large energy barriers in the phase space .",
    "it has been argued that such quenched disorder can mimic glassy systems ( which are generally non - disordered ) .",
    "the theoretical machinery developed in the study of disordered systems then allows one to to proceed in calculations @xcite . however , one still has to come up with arguments that relate the quenched disorder to some dynamically ` self - induced disorder ' @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can go one step further and simply make assumptions about the phase space , such as a valley structure , without specifying how such features arise as a result of the microscopic model .",
    "this forms the basis of the ` trap model ' @xcite . in that scenario one",
    "has a distribution of trap depths in the phase space .",
    "with increasing time the system will explore deeper and deeper traps and remain in them for longer and longer .",
    "we now turn to the idea of coarsening and make comparisons with the glassy dynamics discussed so far . to visualise a coarsening system think of quenching a system from a high temperature phase where its order parameter is zero to a low temperature where the order parameter can take some number of non - zero values ( each different value corresponding to a different ordered phase ) .",
    "domains of the ordered phase(s ) emerge and grow in time and it is this phenomenon that is referred to as coarsening . at late times",
    "the system enters a _ scaling regime _ , that is a regime characterised by a single length scale ( the typical size of domains ) @xmath18 that grows as @xmath19 . in this late time scaling regime the distribution of domains , once scaled by @xmath18 , is statistically invariant .",
    "thus the typical domain size indicates the age of the coarsening system .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath17 depends on the symmetry of the order parameter and conservation laws of the system . for a review see @xcite .    as a concrete example consider the zero temperature ising model with glauber spin - flip dynamics ( non - conserved order parameter ) .",
    "domains of up - spins and down spins are separated by domain walls that perform random walks : a step of the walk corresponds to the event that one of the spins adjacent to the domain wall flips .",
    "when two domain walls meet they annihilate and a domain is eliminated .",
    "straight away one can argue roughly that , since the domain wall motion is diffusive , the time typically required to eliminate domains of size @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "thus the typical domain size after time @xmath14 is @xmath22 .",
    "more precisely one can write the growth law as a differential equation by noting that the rate of change of the typical domain size should be proportional to the inverse of the mean time to eliminate a domain multiplied by the size of the domain being eliminated .",
    "@xmath23 and one recovers @xmath22 .",
    "this growth exponent actually holds for a non - conserved scalar order parameter in two dimensions and above @xcite .",
    "now consider generalising ( [ domains ] ) to the case where some energy barrier @xmath24 ( or more strictly free energy barrier ) is involved in the elimination of the domains and the system is at low but finite temperature .",
    "@xmath25 actually this precludes one dimensional systems that only order up to a finite length scale at finite temperature ( see section  [ abc ] ) , but at very low @xmath0 one can consider the ordering process up to that finite length . some possible scenarios resulting from ( [ domain ] ) have been categorised in @xcite .",
    "if the barriers @xmath24 are independent of @xmath26 one recovers @xmath22 growth .",
    "if the barriers are proportional to @xmath27 one obtains @xmath28^{1/m}$ ] , in particular @xmath29 yields logarithmic growth . in section  [ acic ] it will be shown that for the acic discussed in section  [ kincon ] the energy barriers are logarithmic in @xmath26 thus yielding from ( [ domain ] ) a growth law where the growth exponent is proportional to the temperature as @xmath30 . in section  [ abc ] models will be discussed that have energy barriers that are linear in @xmath26 thus yielding domain growth that is logarithmic in time . for a particular model , the abc model @xcite it will be shown how these linear energy barriers arise .",
    "we refer to such cases where something different from power law growth with temperature independent exponent is exhibited as _ anomalous _ coarsening .",
    "a common approach in the study of coarsening is to make an approximation of a mean - field nature .",
    "that is , one focusses on the probability distribution of the domain sizes and ignores spatial correlations between domains .",
    "such an approach is variously referred to as an interparticle distribution function @xcite , independent intervals approximation @xcite or a ` bag model ' @xcite .",
    "to visualise this one thinks of placing all the domains in a bag _",
    "i.e. _ forgetting how domains are arranged with respect to one another",
    ". then the dynamics become the updating of the domains in the bag . at each update",
    "a domain is selected from the bag along with temporary neighbours .",
    "an update rule is implemented that depends on the shape / size of the domain and its neighbours .",
    "after the update the domains are all replaced in the bag .",
    "for example , in models where domain walls diffuse and annihilate or coalesce , such as the kinetic ising model discussed above , the update rule is to lengthen and shorten domains according to how the domain wall moves . in another class of models @xcite , domains are eliminated at each update with probabilities depending on their size ; then the length of an eliminated domain is distributed amongst the neighbours .",
    "so far , although we have discussed glassy systems out of thermal equilibrium , the dynamics have implicitly been assumed to obey detailed balance in the equilibrium state .",
    "detailed balance means that in the steady state there is no net flow of probability between any two configurations .",
    "however one can consider a much larger class of nonequilibrium systems that are defined solely by their dynamics , without reference to any energy function .",
    "although these systems may relax to some steady state it need not be a steady state described by gibbs - boltzmann statistical mechanics .",
    "in general there will be a net flow of probability between pairs of configuration , leading to probability current loops in the configuration space .",
    "examples of nonequilibrium steady states are given by driven systems with open boundaries where a mass current is driven through the system .",
    "thus the system is driven by its environment rather being in thermal equilibrium with its environment .",
    "in such a driven steady state generic long range correlations may be exhibited @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to an equilibrium state which only exhibits long - range correlations at non - generic points _",
    "i.e. _ phase transitions . since there is no energy function and gibbs - boltzmann statistical mechanics does not apply , there is no general formulation within which to solve for such a driven steady state .",
    "however it has often been suggested that the generic long - range correlations may result from some effective long - range hamiltonian that could describe the dynamics",
    ".    of particular interest have been one - dimensional nonequilibrium systems . for models respecting detailed balance",
    "it is well known that no phase transition or ordering process that continues indefinitely can occur .",
    "however for nonequilibrium systems this is not the case@xcite .",
    "thus nonequilibrium systems afford new possibilities for coarsening processes even in one - dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "moreover there are a number of exactly solvable one dimensional nonequilibrium systems@xcite . in section  [ abc ] the steady state of the abc model",
    "will be solved for some special cases and it will be shown how strong phase separation along with anomalous coarsening can occur in one dimensional systems .",
    "in this section i discuss the model introduced by jckle and eisinger@xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  [ kincon ] it was originally introduced as a model of cooperative , glassy relaxation . in particular the directed nature of the dynamical constraint",
    "implies a hierarchy in the spin relaxation . as i shall now describe the directed nature of the constraint also makes the model amenable to analysis .",
    "the model comprises @xmath31 ising spins @xmath32 on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( site @xmath33 is identified with site @xmath34 ) .",
    "the dynamics are defined by the following spin - flip rates @xmath35 1\\ 0 \\to 1\\ 1 & \\mbox{with rate } & { \\displaystyle}\\epsilon \\end{array}\\label{dynamics}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 thus a spin can only flip if its left neighbour is pointing up ( note that in @xcite the mirror image of the above definition was used , so that that right neighbour had to point up for a spin to be able to flip ) . by a rate ,",
    "say @xmath37 , we mean that in a small time @xmath38 the event happens with probability @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to check that the dynamics obey detailed balance with respect to an energy function @xmath40 _ i.e. _ the equilibrium distribution corresponds to free spins in a downwards pointing field : @xmath41 = \\frac{\\epsilon^{\\sum_i s_i}}{(1+\\epsilon)^l}\\;. \\label{peq}\\ ] ] it follows that the equilibrium concentration of up - spins , @xmath42 , is given by @xmath43 although ( [ peq ] ) would hold for a number of different dynamics obeying detailed balance , other properties such as two time correlation functions may be sensitive to the particular choice of dynamics .",
    "it is clear that the asymmetric dynamical constraint implies that information propagates to the right only .",
    "thus in a thermodynamic limit where information can not propagate all the way around the ring back to the starting point , we must have @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "however , the fact that detailed balance holds implies that in the steady state we must have reversibility . to see this note that when one has detailed balance there is no net flow of probability between any two configurations .",
    "since there is no flow of probability there is nothing to distinguish the forwards direction in time from backwards direction . therefore running the systems backwards in time",
    "will not change any two time correlation functions and @xmath46 since we have argued that for @xmath45 the left hand side of ( [ reverse ] ) is equal to @xmath47 we deduce that the connected correlation function must be site diagonal : @xmath48 this result is particular to the fully asymmetrically constrained model .",
    "we will be interested mainly in the behaviour after a quench from equilibrium at some high initial temperature @xmath49 to low temperature @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) . at low temperatures",
    "the equilibrium concentration of up - spins ( [ c ] ) is small .",
    "thus the quench is followed by a process of elimination of up - spins . however to eliminate an up - spin one first has to generate an adjacent up - spin .",
    "this implies energy barriers in the system s evolution . in figure",
    "[ fig : quench ] the sequence of events after such a quench is illustrated schematically .",
    "@xmath52    the basic objects that we use for the description of the system are _ domains_. as shown by the vertical lines in @xmath53 a domain consists of an up - spin and all the down - spins that separate it from the nearest up - spin to the left .",
    "the length @xmath54 of a domain then gives the distance between the up - spin at its right edge and the nearest up - spin to the left .",
    "note that adjacent up - spins are counted as separate domains of length @xmath55 . in equilibrium ,",
    "the distribution of domain lengths and its average are @xmath56 now consider what happens after a deep quench to @xmath50 , @xmath57 .",
    "the equilibrium concentration of up - spins at the final temperature @xmath0 is @xmath58 ; hence the equilibrium probability of finding an up - spin within a chain segment of _ finite _",
    "length @xmath54 is @xmath59 and tends to zero for @xmath60 . in this limit ( @xmath61 at fixed @xmath54 ) ,",
    "the flipping down of up - spins therefore becomes _ irreversible _ to leading order . in terms of domains",
    ", this means that the coarsening dynamics of the system is one of coalescence of domains : an up - spin that flips down merges two neighbouring domains into one large domain .",
    "such coarsening processes have been studied in a variety of contexts . in particular irreversible coarsening processes in which the rate of elimination depends solely on the domain size",
    "have a very convenient property : during such a process , no correlations between the lengths of neighbouring domains can build up if there are none in the initial state  @xcite .",
    "for the present model the equilibrated initial state consists of domains independently distributed according to ( [ pd_equil ] ) and is indeed uncorrelated .",
    "we take advantage of this property in section  [ acic : coarse ] to obtain an exact solution of the coarsening dynamics .",
    "we first discuss in detail how energy barriers arise in the dynamics .",
    "first we estimate the typical rate @xmath62 at which domains of length @xmath54 disappear by coalescing with their right neighbours . because domain coalescence corresponds to the flipping down of up - spins ,",
    "@xmath62 can also be defined as follows .",
    "consider an open spin chain of length @xmath54 , with a ` clamped ' up - spin ( @xmath63 ) added on the left .",
    "starting from the state @xmath64 = @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the typical time needed to reach the empty state @xmath67 where spin @xmath68 has ` relaxed ' _ i.e. _ has flipped down .",
    "any instance of this relaxation process can be thought of as a path connecting the initial and final states .",
    "let us call the maximum number of ` excited ' spins ( up - spins except @xmath69 ) encountered along a path its height @xmath70 .",
    "one might think that the relaxation of spin @xmath68 needs to proceed via the state 11  1 , giving a path of height @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , the minimal path height @xmath71 is much lower and given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 .    to get a feeling for the result ( [ hierarchy ] ) consider in figure  [ fig : barrier ] some small domain sizes .",

    "e.g. _ for @xmath75 one first generates an isolated up - spin in the middle of the domain then uses this stepping - stone to generate the subsequent excited spins in a similar manner to the relaxation of a @xmath76 domain .",
    "the result ( [ hierarchy ] ) is easily demonstrated for @xmath77  @xcite . to relax the @xmath78-th spin @xmath79",
    ", one can first flip up @xmath80 and use it as a stepping - stone for relaxing @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding path is ( with @xmath80 and @xmath79 underlined ) @xmath81 and reaches height @xmath82 ; the @xmath83 arises because the stepping - stone stays up while the spin @xmath84 to its right is relaxed .",

    ". thus the rate at which such domains are eliminated is @xmath90 from the discussion of section  [ intro : coarse ] and equation  [ domains ] we deduce that the typical domain size grows and the typical energy ( number of up - spins ) decreases as @xmath91 also since @xmath92 the equilibration time is @xmath93\\;. \\label{eits}\\ ] ]      from the scaling of @xmath94 , the coarsening dynamics in the limit @xmath95 naturally divides into stages distinguished by @xmath96 . during stage @xmath17 ,",

    ". this process takes place on a timescale of @xmath98 ; because the timescales for different stages differ by factors of @xmath99 , we can treat them separately in the limit @xmath95 .",
    "thus during stage @xmath17 active domains are eliminated and the distribution of inactive domains ( @xmath100 ) changes because elimination of an active domain implies coalescence with a neighbouring domain and results in the creation of a new inactive domain .",
    "as discussed above for the irreversible system there are no correlations between neighbouring domains .",
    "therefore we can work directly with the probability of domain sizes @xmath101 i.e. the independent intervals approximation sketched in sec  [ intro : coarse ] is actually exact .",

    "the domain coalescence happens through this diffusion process .",
    "thus the energy barrier for elimination of domains does not depend on domain size .",
    "this implies an arrhenius relaxation law and ` strong ' glass behaviour .",

    "eventually this results in a slow decay of the magnetisation ( number of up - spins as ) @xmath183 .",
    "first let us review why indefinite coarsening does not occur in equilibrium systems in one dimension .",
    "perhaps the best known argument is that of landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "( other arguments are summarised in @xcite . ) for simplicity , consider a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath31 sites with two possible states , say @xmath184 and @xmath185 , for each site variable .",
    "let us assume the ordered phases , where all sites take state @xmath184 or all sites take state @xmath185 , have the lowest energy , and assume a domain wall ( a bond on the lattice which divides a region of @xmath184 phase from that of @xmath185 ) costs a finite amount of energy @xmath186 .",

    "the dynamics conserve the number of particles , @xmath193 and @xmath194 of the three species .",
    "the @xmath195 case is special . here",
    "the diffusion is symmetric and every local exchange of particles takes place with the same rate as the reverse move .",

    "this state is disordered and homogeneous ; no phase separation takes place .",

    "the exchange rates an @xmath184 particle moves preferentially to the left inside a @xmath185 domain and to the right inside a @xmath191 domain .",
    "similarly the motion of @xmath185 and @xmath191 particles in foreign domains is biased .",

    "similarly , @xmath199 and @xmath200 domains are unstable too . on the other hand @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 configurations are stable and long - lived . thus after a relatively short time the system reaches a state of the type illustrated in figure  [ fig : quenchabc ] b ) in which @xmath204 and @xmath191 domains are located to the right of @xmath205 and @xmath185 domains , respectively .",
    "the evolution of this state takes place via a slow diffusion process in which , for example @xmath184 particles have to diffuse against a drift over an adjacent @xmath185 domain . the time scale for an @xmath184 particle to cross",
    "is @xmath206 , where @xmath20 is the size of the @xmath185 domain .",
    "we use the discussion of section  [ intro : coarse ] and equation  [ domains ] to deduce that the system coarsens with an average domain size that increases with time as @xmath207 .",
    "eventually the system phase separates into three domains of the three species of the form @xmath208 .    in a finite system",
    "the phase - separated state may further evolve and become disordered due to fluctuations .",
    "however , the time scale for this to happen grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "for example it would take a time of order of @xmath209 for the @xmath184 domain in the totally phase separated state to break up into smaller domains .",
    "hence in the thermodynamic limit , this time scale diverges and the phase separated state remains stable provided the density of each species is non - zero .",
    "note that there are always small fluctuations about a totally phase separated state .",
    "however , these fluctuations affect the densities only near the domain boundaries",
    ". they result in a finite width for the domain walls ( the density profile is not a step function but is smeared out like a fermi function ) .",
    "the fact that any phase - separated state is stable for a time exponentially long in the system size amounts to a breaking of the translational symmetry _",
    "i.e. _ there are @xmath190 equivalent ground states but the system has to spontaneously choose one of them .",
    "since the exchange rates are asymmetric , the system generically supports a particle current in the steady state which implies that detailed balance does not hold . to see this ,",
    "consider the @xmath184 domain in the phase separated state .",
    "an @xmath184 particle near the @xmath210 boundary can traverse the entire @xmath185 domain to the right with an effective rate proportional to @xmath211 .",
    "once it crosses the @xmath185 domain it will move through the @xmath191 domain with speed @xmath212 . similarly an @xmath184 particle near the @xmath213 boundary can traverse the entire @xmath191 domain to the left with an effective rate proportional to @xmath214 . once the domain is crossed it moves through the @xmath185 domain with speed @xmath212 .",
    "hence the net @xmath184 particle current is of the order of @xmath215 . since this current is exponentially small in system size , it vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . for the case of @xmath216",
    ", this argument suggests that the current is strictly zero for any @xmath190 .",
    "the arguments presented above suggesting phase separation for @xmath197 may be easily extended to @xmath217 . in this case , however , the phase separated state is @xmath218 rather than @xmath219 .",
    "this may be seen by noting that the dynamical rules are invariant under the transformation @xmath220 together with @xmath221 .",
    "the general argument presented in the previous subsection suggests that for the special case @xmath216 , in the steady state ( _ i.e. _ after the coarsening process ) there are no currents for any system size .",
    "we demonstrate this explicitly by showing that the _ local dynamics _ of the model satisfies detailed balance with respect to a _ long - range asymmetric _ energy function @xmath222 .",
    "we define the occupation variables as follows : @xmath223 the variables @xmath224 and @xmath225 are defined similarly .",
    "clearly the relation @xmath226 is satisfied .",
    "it turns out that for the case @xmath227 the steady - state distribution @xmath228 corresponding to the dynamics ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) may be written in terms of an energy function @xmath222 : @xmath229 @xmath230-(n/3)^2 \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath231 is the partition sum given by @xmath232 , where the sum is over all configurations in which @xmath216 .",
    "note that although the system is periodic and site 1 is not in any way special ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) appears to single out site 1 .",
    "thus it is not clear that ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) is translationally invariant under relabelling of the spins .    in order to turn equation ( [ eq : weight ] ) into a usual boltzmann form",
    "one could define @xmath233 as a temperature variable with @xmath234 thus , @xmath235 is the infinite - temperature limit , corresponding to the disorder state where each configuration is equally likely .",
    "the proof of equations  ( [ eq : weight],[eq : hamilton ] ) is straightforward .",
    "this is done by considering a nearest - neighbour particle exchange and verifying that detailed balance is satisfied with respect to ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) .",
    "then we just have to check that the energy function is translationally invariant .",
    "we defer the proof to section  [ abcgen ] where we consider a more general @xmath236-species model .    before proceeding further to evaluate the partition sum associated with the energy function ( [ eq : hamilton ] )",
    "let us make a few observations .",
    "the ground state of the energy function is given by the fully separated state @xmath237 and its translationally related states .",
    "it easy to check that the ground state with the @xmath184 domain beginning at site 1 has zero energy since the contribution to the sum in ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) ( coming from the @xmath238 term ) is equal to @xmath239 . a simple way of evaluating the energy of an arbitrary configuration is obtained by noting that nearest - neighbour exchanges @xmath240 and @xmath241 cost one unit of energy each while the reverse exchanges result in an energy gain of one unit .",
    "the energy of an arbitrary configuration may thus be evaluated by starting with the ground state and performing nearest neighbour exchanges until the configuration is reached , keeping track of the energy changes at each step of the way .",
    "the highest energy is @xmath242 and it corresponds to the totally phase separated configuration @xmath243 and its @xmath190 translations .",
    "note that the majority of configurations have energy proportional to @xmath244 . in section  [ sec : mss ]",
    "it will be shown that this implies that only the ground states and low energy excitations about them contribute to the equilibrium state .    to write @xmath222 in a manifestly translationally invariant form",
    "we define @xmath245 as the energy function in which site @xmath246 is the origin .",
    "namely , @xmath247 -(n/3)^2 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the summation over @xmath248 and @xmath249 is modulo @xmath190 . summing ( [ hi0 ] ) over all @xmath246 and dividing by @xmath190 , one obtains , @xmath250 where in the summation the value of the site index @xmath251 is modulo @xmath190 . in the energy function ( [ eq : h_tinvar ] )",
    "the interaction is linear in the distance between the particles , and thus is long ranged .",
    "the distance is measured in a preferred direction from site @xmath248 to site @xmath252 .",
    "thus the interaction is asymmetric .",
    "a minimum of the energy ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) is realised by a configuration with no unstable domain walls ( @xmath253 , @xmath254 or @xmath255 ) so that any exchange of nearest neighbour particles results in an increase in the energy . as well as the @xmath190 ground states there are many metastable states .",
    "any metastable state is composed of a sequence of domains separated by @xmath256 and @xmath203 domain walls _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath204 and @xmath191 domains follow @xmath205 and @xmath185 domains , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : quenchabc ] b ) .",
    "therefore each metastable state has an equal number of domains of each type .",
    "we shall refer to any metastable state with @xmath139 domains of each type , with @xmath257 , as an @xmath139-state ; the total number of domains in an @xmath139-state is @xmath258 .",
    "the @xmath259 case corresponds to the ground state while @xmath260 corresponds to the @xmath261 state , composed of a total of @xmath190 domains each of length @xmath262 .",
    "note that in general the domains of an @xmath139-state need not be of equal length .    in the coarsening process",
    "it is these metastable states that control the dynamics .",
    "we discuss here some properties of the states such as their number and energy .    to obtain a bound for @xmath263 , the number of metstable states with @xmath139 domains of each species , note that the number of ways of dividing @xmath264 @xmath184 particles into @xmath139 domains is @xmath265 .",

    "we now consider the energy of the metastable states .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that among all @xmath139-states , none has energy lower than the configuration illustrated in figure  [ fig : mss ] .",
    "@xmath268    the energy of this state , @xmath269 satisfies the following recursion relation @xmath270 with @xmath271 . to see this from figure  [ fig : mss ] , note that the @xmath272-state may be created from the @xmath139-state by first moving a @xmath185 particle from the leftmost @xmath185 domain across @xmath273 @xmath191 particles to the right , costing @xmath273 units of energy .",
    "then move an @xmath184 particle from the leftmost @xmath184 domain to the right across the adjacent @xmath185 and @xmath191 domains ; no net energy change results .",
    "thus the total energy cost of the moves is @xmath273 , yielding ( [ rr ] ) .",
    "the recursion relation ( [ rr ] ) , together with @xmath274 , is readily solved to give @xmath275 the energy of all metastable @xmath139-states is larger or equal to @xmath269 as given by equation ( [ emss ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath269 increases with @xmath139 .",
    "furthermore , for finite @xmath139 the energy is linear in @xmath190 whereas for @xmath276 the energy becomes quadratic in @xmath190 .",
    "now let us consider the contribution of the metastable states to the partition sum .",
    "multiplying the upper bound on the number of @xmath139-state ( [ nmss ] ) with the lower bound on the energy ( [ emss ] ) one obtains an upper bound on the contribution to the partition sum that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xmath277 ^ 3   q^ { ( s-1 ) n/3 - s(s-1)/2 } \\to 0\\quad \\mbox{for $ s>1 $ , $ q<1 $ and $ n \\to \\infty$}\\;. \\label{partmss}\\ ] ] however , the contribution from the ground states @xmath259 is @xmath190 .",
    "thus even though metastable states dominate the dynamics , they do not contribute to the partition sum since in ( [ partmss ] ) the energy grows more strongly than the entropic contribution .",
    "we now analyse in more detail the behaviour of the partition sum . in principle one",
    "wants to compute @xmath278 where the sum is over _ all _ configurations in which @xmath216 .",
    "first note that any configuration that contains unstable domain walls ( _ i.e. _ is not a metastable state ) can be associated with a metastable state by a path of decreasing energy comprising nearest neighbour exchange eliminating of the unstable walls .",
    "conversely the sum over all configurations may be implemented by summing over all ground states and metastable states and the excitations about those states .",
    "it is not hard to believe that as the metastable states make vanishing contributions to @xmath231 so do excitations about them .",
    "this is proven rigorously in @xcite . in the following",
    "we just consider the excitations about the ground states .",
    "@xmath279    consider figure  [ fig : excited ] where a low energy excitation about a ground state is illustrated .",
    "the excitation is localised near the @xmath280 domain wall and comprises one or more @xmath184 particles penetrating into the @xmath185 domain ( equivalently @xmath185 particles penetrating into the @xmath184 domain ) .",
    "the energy cost is given by the sum of the distances each @xmath184 particle has penetrated into the @xmath185 domain .",
    "thus the total number of excitations of energy @xmath236 at the boundary is the number of ways of dividing @xmath236 into an ordered set of integers corresponding to the distance the first @xmath184 has moved , the distance the second @xmath184 has moved and so on . this is equal to @xmath281 the number of _ partitions _ of the integer @xmath236 .",

    "the three domain walls have no significant interaction .",

    "we consider a system at time @xmath14 such that the average domain size , @xmath297 , is much larger than the domain wall width . at these time scales ,",
    "the domain walls can be taken as sharp and we may consider only events which modify the size of domains .",
    "this means that the dynamics of the system can be approximated by considering only the movement of particles between neighbouring domains of the same species .",

    "a model closely related to the abc model is that first introduced by lahiri and ramaswamy @xcite in the context of sedimenting colloidal crystals .",

    "reside two species of particles with no holes . on the first sublattice ( at integer sites ) the particles",

    "i.e. _ the particles make nearest neighbour exchanges on their respective sublattices but the rates are influenced by what kind of particle is occupying the intermediate site on the other sublattice . in @xcite more general rates than ( [ lrdynamics ] ) were originally considered but the above dynamics appear to capture all the generic behaviour@xcite .    in the regime @xmath356 and @xmath357 phase separation",
    "is observed into ordered domains of @xmath358 , @xmath359 , @xmath360 , @xmath361 .",
    "that is , on each lattice the particles ultimately separate into pure domains with one ring rotated by @xmath362 with respect to the other . during",
    "the coarsening process domain lengths grow logarithmically in time . in @xcite the separation into pure domains , as first analysed in the abc model , was termed ` strong phase separation ' .    in the special case where",
    "each lattice is half - filled with particles and @xmath363 ( where the parameter @xmath233 has been introduced to allow comparison with the abc model ) , the steady state weight @xmath364 satisfies detailed balance with respect to a long - range energy function very similar in form to ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) @xmath365 where @xmath366 where @xmath2 and @xmath367 are each ising spins variables for one of the sublattices : @xmath368 corresponds to a @xmath351 ( @xmath352 ) particle and @xmath369 corresponds to tilt @xmath354 ( @xmath370 ) .",
    "a very useful intuitive picture of this energy function is to regard @xmath371 as the height of an interface ( relative to some origin)@xcite .",
    "thus the dynamics correspond to the @xmath351 and @xmath352 particles making nearest neighbour interchanges on a landscape ( implied by the tilt variables ) that at the same time is evolving in a way coupled to the @xmath351 , @xmath352 particles .",
    "the long - range energy corresponds to the gravitational potential energy of the @xmath351 particles on this landscape .",
    "a @xmath351 particle will have its energy minimised at the bottom of a valley of the interface .",
    "a ground state then corresponds to the configuration that allows the @xmath351 particles to minimise collectively their energy , namely , the tilt variables form one deep valley with the @xmath351 particles residing at the bottom : @xmath372 the picture of particles moving on an evolving landscape is very appealing in the context of glassy dynamics .",
    "it is evocative of the glassy regime of a hard - sphere colloid where particles move in cages formed by the other particles  when a particle escapes from its cage it will cause the cages of other particles to be restructured .    in the regime @xmath356 and",
    "@xmath373 the system is in a disordered phase . in the regime @xmath356 and",
    "@xmath374 the fluctuations in the landscape are uncoupled to the particle dynamics , yet the system still exhibits an interesting coarsening dynamics@xcite .    a further model related to the abc model has been studied by arndt , heinzel and rittenberg @xcite .",
    "it was originally couched in terms of @xmath351,@xmath352 particles and holes diffusing on a one - dimensional periodic lattice with hop rates @xmath375 + \\:0 & \\stackrel{{\\displaystyle}1}{{\\displaystyle}\\longrightarrow } & 0\\,+\\label{ahr}\\\\ 0\\:- & \\stackrel{{\\displaystyle}1}{{\\displaystyle}\\longrightarrow } & -\\:0 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to make a comparison with the abc model we identify a @xmath351 particle with an @xmath184 , a @xmath352 particle with a @xmath185 , and a hole with a @xmath191 then the dynamics ( [ ahr ] ) become @xmath192 c\\,b~~\\stackrel{{\\displaystyle}1}{{\\displaystyle}\\longrightarrow}~~b\\,c \\\\ a\\,c~~\\stackrel{{\\displaystyle}1}{{\\displaystyle}\\longrightarrow}~~c\\,a\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus this model corresponds to the abc model with some exchanges forbidden and for @xmath197 one has the same strong phase separation .",
    "however for @xmath217 this model enters a disordered phase , whereas in the abc model one has phase separation but with the order of domains permuted to @xmath376 .",
    "originally it was thought that there was also a ` mixed ' phase in the model @xcite .",
    "it now appears that this is a very strong finite size effect for @xmath377 @xcite .",
    "an appealing feature of this model is that the steady state can , in principle , be computed exactly by a matrix product approach for all numbers of particles @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that a model with cyclic symmetry and non - conserving dynamics that exhibits coarsening has been studied @xcite .",
    "in this paper i have reviewed a variety of simple models that exhibit anomalous coarsening in the sense that the dynamics slow down with time and the coarsening becomes anomalously slow  slower than the usual power law growth of domain size with time . in the models",
    "discussed the slowdown in the coarsening is due to dynamical constraints rather than any quenched disorder .",
    "the dynamical constraints imply that energy barriers must be surmounted in order for the system to coarsen further .",
    "thus the system is delayed in metastable states for increasingly long times during the coarsening process and in this sense the evolution of the system is glassy .    in sections  2 and 3",
    "i focussed on two models : the acic and the abc model .",
    "in the acic model the energy barriers encountered during coarsening are logarithmic in the domain size whereas for the abc model the barriers are linear .",
    "this leads to the domain growth @xmath378 ( as @xmath30 ) for the acic and @xmath379 for the abc model .",
    "despite similarities there are distinctions between the two models .",
    "for the acic the energy function is trivial ",
    "free spins in a field  and the dynamics obey detailed balance .",
    "but it is the existence of forbidden spin - flips that generates the energy barriers in the relaxation paths . on the other hand in the abc model the dynamics",
    "are prescribed without regard to an energy function and no exchanges ( that conserve the particle numbers ) are forbidden .",
    "however in a special case one can identify an effective long - range energy function and the anomalous coarsening can be explained in terms of linear energy barriers in the coarsening process .",
    "lastly , the abc model will ultimately coarsen into pure domains whose size is related to the system size whereas the acic only coarsens up to a length @xmath380 that is independent of system size . for both models there exist other related models that exhibit similar behaviour , thus reinforcing their interest .",
    "the question remains as to how faithfully the anomalous coarsening scenario describes a true ( experimental ) glassy system .",
    "although the models are by no means meant to represent any particular system , one recovers the correct phenomenology  for example in the acic we derived stretched exponential decay of an auto - correlation function and eits law for equilibration .",
    "nevertheless it is widely thought that a coarsening system is distinct from a glassy system .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "firstly , in a glassy system such as hard - sphere colloid , the ordered phase ( crystalline state ) is thought to be irrelevant since its nucleation barrier is too large .",
    "thus there are no coarsening domains of an ordered crystalline phase . on the other hand at present we do not have any known spatial order parameter for a glassy phase so it is unclear how domains of the glassy phase would coarsen . secondly , coarsening implies a definite direction in the dynamics , towards the fully coarsened state .",
    "contrary to this , phenomenological trap models of glassy dynamics @xcite rely on a random exploration of the traps that exist in the phase space .",
    "that is , when a system manages to escape from one trap it falls randomly into another trap . in this way , as the time scale increases , the system will locate deeper traps and stay in them for longer .",
    "finally dynamically constrained models by nature rely on specific dynamics rather than the nature of an energy function ( if it exists ) .",
    "this contrasts with the ` inherent structures ' approach to glassy dynamics where the energy landscape is the key feature @xcite .",
    "this point is examined in the present volume by crisanti and ritort .",
    "indeed a criterion has been proposed to distinguish between coarsening dynamics and glassy dynamics@xcite in a microscopic model .",
    "one runs a simulation for a certain time then makes two copies of the simulation .",
    "these copies start from identical initial conditions ( where the initial simulation was halted ) but use different realisations of the noise in their dynamics _",
    "i.e. _ different sets of random numbers in a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "then , if the states of the two simulations remain strongly correlated ( have a finite overlap ) as time goes by one has a coarsening system .",
    "this is termed type i behaviour . on the other hand ,",
    "if the states of the two simulations become less and less correlated then the system is a glassy system this is termed type ii behaviour .",
    "the idea behind this relies on the belief that for a coarsening system there is always a preferred direction in the phase space along which all simulations will be swept , whereas in a glassy system the traps in the phase space are essentially explored randomly by each simulation .    at present",
    "it is not clear how general this categorisation is .",
    "for example it is not yet clear how systems that coarsen but have many ground states , such as the abc model or the model of @xcite , are accounted for .",
    "let us also mention a 3-d ferromagnetic ising model with plaquette interactions@xcite .",
    "in this model one has the usual doubly degenerate ferromagnetic ground states . in addition , flipping any plane of spins does not increase the energy .",
    "thus in total there is an exponential number of degenerate ground states . in a quench to low temperature type ii glassy behaviour",
    "is exhibited@xcite yet it is thought that coarsening occurs whereby a characteristic length grows anomalously slowly , possibly as @xmath316 . for a related model of competing ferromagnet and",
    "next nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions that has just the two ferromagnetic ground states , logarithmic coarsening is observed and explained in terms of energy barriers@xcite .",
    "the glassy coarsening dynamics of the plaquette model is not so well understood@xcite .",
    "it would certainly be of interest to broaden our understanding by studying further examples of anomalous coarsening .",
