    "carbon monoxide ( co ) is a key constituent of the gas making up the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) that are the site of almost all galactic star formation .",
    "although almost all of the molecular gas mass within a gmc is in the form of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) , this material is extremely difficult to observe directly , as the temperatures within a gmc are too low to excite even the lowest accessible rotational transition of the h@xmath0 molecule , the quadrupole transition between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 rotational levels . on the other hand",
    ", co does become rotationally excited at gmc temperatures , owing to the much smaller energy separation between its rotational levels .",
    "it is readily observed in the millimeter , and is arguably the single most important observational tracer of the state of the gas within the clouds .",
    "it also plays an important role as the main molecular coolant of the gas over a wide range in densities ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore important to understand the distribution of co within gmcs , and how this relates to the underlying gas distribution .",
    "unfortunately , this is not a simple task .",
    "it has been understood for a long time that the gas within gmcs is typically not in chemical equilibrium ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recently , numerical modelling has highlighted the fact that the co abundance within a given parcel of gas within a gmc is a complex function of the density and temperature of the gas , the local radiation field ( modulated by absorption by gas elsewhere in the cloud ) , and possibly also the dynamical history of the gas @xcite .",
    "it has also become increasingly clear that molecular clouds are dynamically complex objects , dominated by supersonic , turbulent motions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comprehensive overview ) , and that we ignore the effects of this dynamical complexity at our peril",
    ". therefore , if we want to be able to accurately model the formation and destruction of co within a gmc , the use of detailed models that treat both the chemistry and the turbulent dynamics in an appropriately coupled fashion seems unavoidable .",
    "however , this presents us with a serious numerical challenge .",
    "even if we focus only on the chemistry of hydrogen , helium , carbon and oxygen , and ignore other elements such as nitrogen or sulphur , there are still a very large number of possible reactions and reactants that we could include in our chemical model .",
    "for example , in the 2006 release of the umist database for astrochemistry @xcite , there are 2115 such reactions , involving a total of 172 different chemical species .",
    "in particular , it is the large number of chemical species that must potentially be handled that is the main source of our problems .",
    "if we model the chemical evolution of the gas by using a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) to represent the rates of change of the chemical abundances , then we find that the required set of odes is generally extremely stiff , containing processes with a wide range of different intrinsic timescales .",
    "to evolve this set of odes in a numerically stable fashion , we must therefore either evolve them explicitly in time using extremely small timesteps , which is impractical , or evolve them implicitly in time .",
    "however , if we adopt an implicit approach , then we find in general that the computational cost of solving the implicit odes scales as the cube of the number of species involved , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath5 is large , the cost of solving the chemical rate equations can easily come to dominate the total computational cost , putting strict limits on the size of the problems that can be tackled . in practice ,",
    "values of @xmath5 as large as 14 can be handled in three - dimensional turbulence simulations at the present day ( see e.g.  @xcite ; note that while their model includes 32 distinct chemical species , all but 14 of these are assumed to be in chemical equilibrium , or are trivially derivable from conservation laws ) , but even in this case , solving the chemical rate equations can take up as much as 90% of the total runtime of the simulation . scaling up from here to the @xmath6 subset of the umist database mentioned above remains computationally impractical in three - dimensional simulations .",
    "for this reason , a number of authors have sought to reduce @xmath5 to a more tractable value by identifying and retaining only the most important of the reactions involved in the formation and destruction of co , as well as making other simplifications that are discussed in later sections .",
    "when identifying the key reactions , there is an obvious trade - off between complexity ( and hence computational cost ) and completeness : the larger the number of possible chemical pathways that we include , the slower the code will run .",
    "there are models available in the literature that span a range of different complexities , but until now there has been no comparison of the results produced by these different approaches .    in this paper , we present results from a detailed comparison of several different approximate methods for modelling co formation and destruction in turbulent molecular clouds that span a range of different complexities .",
    "we are interested in particular in establishing which results from simulations of turbulent clouds are highly sensitive to the choice of simplified chemical model , and which are relatively insensitive .",
    "the basic setup of the simulations used here is similar to that described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use the zeus - mp code to model driven magnetohydrodynamical turbulence in a cubical volume , with side length @xmath7 , using periodic boundary conditions for the gas .",
    "the turbulence is driven using the algorithm described in @xcite , and the amplitude of the driving is chosen in order to maintain the rms turbulent velocity at @xmath8 .",
    "the initial magnetic field strength is @xmath9 , and the field is assumed to be initially uniform and oriented parallel to the @xmath10-axis of the simulation .",
    "the effects of self - gravity are not included .",
    "the simulations are run for @xmath11 , or approximately three turbulent eddy turnover times .",
    "we showed in @xcite that this is long enough to allow the co distribution to settle into a statistical steady state .",
    "we perform two sets of simulations ( hereafter denoted as set 1 and set 2 ) with different initial densities : @xmath12 for set 1 and @xmath13 for set 2 , where @xmath14 is the initial number density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "the corresponding mean extinctions are therefore @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , where we have assumed a conversion factor from hydrogen column density to dust visual extinction of @xmath17 , appropriate to dust in the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "we therefore expect that in both cases , detectable amounts of co will be produced in the clouds , even though the mean mass - weighted co abundance should differ by more than an order of magnitude between the two sets of runs @xcite .    in both sets of simulations ,",
    "we adopt elemental abundances ( by number , relative to hydrogen ) of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for helium , carbon and oxygen , respectively .",
    "we assume that the hydrogen , helium and oxygen are initially atomic , and that the carbon is initially in singly ionized form throughout the simulation volume .",
    "we set the initial gas temperature to 60  k and the initial dust temperature to 10  k in both sets of simulations .",
    "to model the subsequent heating and cooling of the gas and the dust , we use a modified version of the @xcite thermal model , as described in that paper and in the appendix . set 1 and set 2 consist of six simulations each , one for each of the chemical models described in section  [ chem_model ] . in the models that include the effects of cosmic rays ,",
    "we adopt a rate @xmath21 for the cosmic ray ionization of atomic hydrogen .",
    "finally , to model the effects of the external ultraviolet radiation field , we assume that its strength and shape are the same as those of the standard @xcite field .",
    "we illuminate each side of the simulation box using the unattenuated field , and model attenuation within the box due to dust absorption , h@xmath0 self - shielding , co self - shielding and the shielding of co by h@xmath0 using the ` six - ray ' approximation introduced by @xcite .",
    "full details of this procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the first model we consider is a slightly modified version of the @xcite chemical model .",
    "this consists of 218 reactions amongst 32 species , and so although it is the most complicated of the approximate models included in this study , it nevertheless still represents a considerable simplification compared to a model including the full set of reactions from e.g.  the umist database for astrochemistry .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that this simplified model could accurately reproduce the results obtained with a far more comprehensive model for several 1d test problems , while at the same time being small enough to be usable in a three - dimensional simulation .",
    "we have made one significant change to the @xcite chemical network : the inclusion of an optional treatment of the effects of the recombination of h@xmath22 , he@xmath22 , c@xmath22 , and o@xmath22 ions on the surfaces of charged dust grains .",
    "we treat these processes using the formalism of @xcite , which includes the effects of very small dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .",
    "these grain surface processes are not included in any of the other models that we examine , and in order to understand what effect they have on the outcome of the simulations , we have performed runs both with and without them . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we denote these simulations as g10 g and g10ng , respectively .",
    "we have also made a number of modifications to our treatment of the thermodynamic behaviour of the gas , in order to improve our ability to model very cold gas .",
    "these improvements are used for all of the models examined here and full details of them are given in the appendix .",
    "a much simpler approximation is given by the model proposed by @xcite , which they used to study the dynamics of low - mass ( @xmath23@xmath24 ) molecular clouds . in their study",
    ", @xcite assume that all of the hydrogen is already in the form of h@xmath0 , and focus their attention on the conversion of singly ionized carbon , c@xmath22 , to carbon monoxide , co. their approximation involves the assumption of direct conversion from c@xmath22 to co , and vice versa , which allows them to ignore any intermediate species ( such as neutral atomic carbon , c ) .",
    "they assume that the conversion of c@xmath22 to co is initiated by the formation of an intermediate hydrocarbon radical ( e.g.  ch or ch@xmath0 ) , which they denote as ch@xmath25 .",
    "this may then react with oxygen to form co , or be photodissociated by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "once co has formed , it is then only destroyed by photodissociation , yielding c and o , but the neutral carbon produced in this way is assumed to be instantly photoionized , yielding c@xmath22 .",
    "since the formation of the hydrocarbon radical will typically involve a slow radiative association reaction as the initial step , such as the formation of ch@xmath26 via @xmath27 @xcite assume that this is the rate limiting step for the formation of co , and write the rate equation for the co number density as : and [ nl97_2 ] , writing @xmath28 in place of @xmath29 in equation  [ nl97_1 ] ( equation  18 in their paper ) and vice versa in equation  [ nl97_2 ] ( equation 20 in their paper ) .",
    "however , this appears to be a typographical error , as one can see by considering the behaviour of the system when the h@xmath0 number density and the uv field strength are both zero . according to the logic of the nl97 model ,",
    "the formation rate of co in this case should also be zero , since h@xmath0 is required in order to form the intermediate hydrocarbon radical .",
    "however , if one uses the original expressions given in @xcite for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , one finds that they do not show this behaviour  instead , @xmath32 in the limit that @xmath33 and the predicted co formation rate remains larger than zero .",
    "] @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number density of c@xmath22 ions and @xmath29 is the number density of hydrogen molecules . in equation  [ nl97_1 ]",
    ", @xmath36 is the rate coefficient for the formation of the intermediate ch@xmath25 ion or radical , which @xcite give as @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the photodissociation rate of co , given in their model as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the strength of the ultraviolet radiation field in units of the @xcite field . in our simulations ,",
    "we adopt the @xcite parameterization of the interstellar ultraviolet radiation field and so @xmath41 .",
    "the variable @xmath31 in equation  [ nl97_1 ] represents the proportion of the ch@xmath25 that successfully forms co. this is given in the @xcite model by @xmath42 where @xmath28 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath43 is the fractional abundance of atomic oxygen , @xmath44 is the rate coefficient for the formation of co from o + ch@xmath25 , given by @xcite as @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the photodissociation rate of ch@xmath25 , given by @xmath47    we have implemented this treatment of the carbon chemistry , with a couple of minor changes . in place of the rate assumed by @xcite for @xmath38 , we use a rate @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a shielding factor that quantifies the effects of co self - shielding and the shielding of co by h@xmath0 lyman - werner band absorption .",
    "this is the same rate coefficient as that used in the g10 g model , and is based on work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have made this substitution in an effort to minimize any differences between the models that arise purely from differences in the rate coefficients adopted .",
    "the influence of rate coefficient uncertainties on molecular cloud chemistry has been studied in detail elsewhere ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is not our primary focus here , as we are interested more in the influence of the design of the chemical network itself .",
    "since we have adopted a larger value for @xmath38 , we have also adopted a larger value for @xmath46 , so as to keep the ratio of @xmath50 in the optically thin limit the same as in @xcite .",
    "this yields a value for @xmath46 that is more in keeping with the rates adopted for ch and ch@xmath0 photodissociation and photoionization in the g10 g model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) . to compute the shielding factor @xmath49",
    ", we use our standard six - ray treatment to determine the h@xmath0 and co column densities , and then convert these to a shielding factor using the data tabulated in @xcite .",
    "in addition , and unlike @xcite , we do not assume that the hydrogen is completely molecular , but instead follow the evolution of the h@xmath0 and h@xmath22 abundances explicitly using the same hydrogen chemistry network as in @xcite .",
    "the abundance of neutral atomic hydrogen , h , then follows from a simple conservation law .",
    "we include the effects of h@xmath0 self - shielding and dust shielding using the same six - ray treatment as in the g10 g model .",
    "in a later paper , nelson & langer suggested an alternative approximation for modelling the formation of co @xcite .",
    "this was designed for a similar purpose as the @xcite approximation , but is considerably more sophisticated .",
    "notably , it allows for the formation of co via multiple pathways . in addition to the formation channel involving the composite hydrocarbon radical ch@xmath25 ( which should be understood to represent both ch and ch@xmath0 ) that forms the basis of the nl97 model , the @xcite model ( hereafter nl99 )",
    "also allows for co formation via the composite oxygen species oh@xmath25 ( representing the species oh , h@xmath0o , o@xmath0 and their ions ) as well as via the recombination of hco@xmath22 .",
    "in addition , photodissociation is no longer the only fate for the co : the network also includes the conversion of co to hco@xmath22 by proton transfer from h@xmath51 , and its destruction by dissociative charge transfer from ionized helium : @xmath52 a further notable difference between the nl97 and nl99 models is the fact that the latter model tracks the abundance of neutral atomic carbon , rather than just c@xmath22 and co. finally , @xcite also include in their model a small number of reactions involving a species they denote as m that represents the combined effects of low ionization potential metals such as mg , fe , ca and na , which become the dominant atomic charge carriers in very shielded regions of the cloud .",
    "the full list of reactions included in the @xcite model is given in table  [ tab : nl99 ] .",
    ".reactions in the nl99 chemical model [ tab : nl99 ] [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      c@xmath22 , c and co are all important coolants at the temperatures and densities found within molecular clouds , and so differences in the predicted distributions of these species may have an effect on the thermal evolution of the gas and on its temperature structure at the end of the simulation .    , height=326 ]    we have investigated this by examining the time evolution of the mass - weighted mean gas temperature , plotted in figure  [ tmean ] . in the low density runs ,",
    "the mean temperature drops very rapidly from our initial value of 60  k to a value of approximately 30  k. thereafter , it evolves very little over the course of the simulation .",
    "the six different chemical models predict very similar values for the mean temperature .",
    "the most discrepant outcome is for model g10 g , which predicts a final mean temperature that is roughly 1  k cooler than in the other runs .",
    "this result is easy to understand given the results for the mean mass - weighted abundances of c@xmath22 , c and co in these runs , discussed earlier in section  [ time_evol ] .",
    "c@xmath22 is the dominant form of carbon in all of these runs , and hence will be the dominant coolant .",
    "differences in the abundances of c or co will therefore have only a minor impact on the energy balance of the gas , and hence will have little effect on the mean gas temperature .",
    "however , in the case of model g10 g , the atomic carbon abundance becomes large enough that its contribution to the cooling of the gas can no longer be neglected .",
    "since the energy separation of the fine structure levels in neutral carbon is significantly smaller than in singly ionized carbon , the former is a more effective low temperature coolant than the latter , and so increasing the c abundance at the expense of the c@xmath22 abundance leads to an overall lower temperature for the gas .    in the higher density runs , the mean temperature again drops very rapidly initially , before stabilizing at a value of around 1719  k. in this case , the difference between the models is more pronounced , with runs nl97 , kc08 and kc08n predicting the highest temperatures , and run g10 g predicting the lowest .",
    "however , at the end of the simulations , the difference between the runs is only 2  k , or roughly 10% .",
    "the differences can again be easily understood on the basis of our prior results for the mean abundances . in this case , the c and co abundances are much higher , and so c@xmath22 is no longer the dominant radiative coolant .",
    "instead , the cooling is typically dominated by co ( runs nl97 , kc08e and kc08n ) or by a mixture of atomic carbon and co ( the other three runs ) .",
    "there is a clear inverse correlation between the amount of atomic carbon present in the gas and the final mean temperature .",
    "we have also examined the temperature distribution of the gas at the end of the simulations , as shown in figure  [ temp - pdf ] , where we plot mass - weighted pdfs of the gas temperature for the various runs . in both the low and the high density cases ,",
    "the pdf at @xmath53 shows almost no dependence on the chemical model , consistent with it representing gas which is dominated by c@xmath22 in all of the models .",
    "below 30  k , however , clear differences become apparent . in the low density case ,",
    "runs g10ng , nl99 , kc08n , kc08e and nl97 all show a clear peak at a temperature of around 20  k , but in run g10 g , this peak occurs at the lower temperature of 10  k. runs nl97 , kc08e and kc08n all produce very little gas cooler than 10  k , but in the other three runs we find a significant fraction of gas with temperatures in the range of 510  k. in the high density run , the behaviour changes slightly . runs nl97 , kc08e and kc08n still have a clear feature in the pdf at @xmath54 , but the true peak is now found at a temperature slightly larger than 10  k. in runs g10 g , g10ng and nl99 , on the other hand , the peak is at the slightly lower temperature of 9  k , with this feature being more pronounced in run g10 g than in the other two runs .",
    "the behaviour of these three runs at temperatures below this peak value is very similar .",
    ", height=326 ]    the differences between the low temperature behaviour in the various runs can be relatively easily understood . in the low density runs ,",
    "little co is formed , and so in most of the gas , the dominant cooling mechanisms are c@xmath22 and c fine structure emission , with some contribution from dust in the densest regions .",
    "the energy separation of the @xmath55p@xmath56 ground state and the @xmath55p@xmath57 excited state of c@xmath22 is approximately 92  k , and hence it can not easily cool the gas below about 1520  k , owing to the exponential suppression of the cooling rate . on the other hand ,",
    "atomic carbon has a separation of only 24  k between its two lowest lying energy levels , and so remains an effective coolant down to temperatures of order 5  k. therefore , chemical models producing greater quantities of atomic carbon will tend to produce lower gas temperatures .",
    "for instance , as we have already seen , run g10 g produces more atomic carbon in intermediate density gas ( @xmath58 ) than runs g10ng or nl99 . in the low density case , little co",
    "is formed , as we have already seen , and so most of the 10  k gas produced in this case comes from regions that are dominated by cooling from neutral carbon .",
    "consequently , run g10 g produces significantly more of this 10  k gas than runs g10ng or nl99 .",
    "on the other hand , run nl97 produces no neutral carbon , and hence only very little 10  k gas . in the higher density simulations ,",
    "which have much higher mean co abundances , much more of the 10  k gas is situated in regions dominated by co cooling , and so the differences between runs g10 g , g10ng and nl99 are much smaller than in the low density case . the lack of neutral carbon in run nl97 , and the fact that it underproduces co at low densities mean that it still disagrees with these three models , and produces less very cold gas .",
    "the behaviour of runs kc08e and kc08n is very similar to that of run nl97 because the small amount of neutral carbon produced in runs kc08e and kc08n is not enough to significantly affect the thermal balance of the gas , and as we have already seen , the co and c@xmath22 abundances in these runs are very similar to those in run nl97 .",
    "finally , we have investigated whether the differences in the temperature distributions examined above lead to any significant differences in the density distribution of the gas , as quantified by the density pdf .",
    "this is of particular importance for understanding the level of accuracy in the modelling of the co chemistry that is necessary in order to allow us to model star formation accurately , as there are a number of theoretical models that argue that it is the shape of the density pdf that determines the stellar initial mass function @xcite or the star formation rate @xcite in a molecular cloud .    in figure  [ dpdf]a",
    ", we plot the density pdfs for the simulations in set 1 . in figure",
    "[ dpdf]b , we show a similar plot for the simulations in set 2 . we see that in both cases , over most of the density range spanned by the pdf , there is essentially no difference between the results of any of the runs , indicating that at these densities , the physical structure of the gas is insensitive to the co abundance .",
    "minor differences start to become apparent in the high density tail of the pdfs , but even here the differences are small . in addition",
    ", they occur at densities that are not well resolved in our current simulations , and we can not be completely certain that they would persist in higher resolution simulations .    , but over the rest of the density range , all six runs agree very well .",
    "( b ) as ( a ) , but for the runs in set 2 .",
    "again , there is very good agreement between the runs at almost all densities , with only a few minor differences becoming apparent in the high density tail .",

    "recent work by @xcite has shown that the proportionality parameter @xmath65 is sensitive to the relative strength of the solenoidal and compressive modes in the forcing field used to drive the turbulence , and ranges from @xmath66 for purely solenoidal forcing to @xmath67 for purely compressive forcing . in each case",
    ", the effects of the gas temperature enter through the dependence of @xmath59 on the volume - weighted rms mach number . in our simulations ,",
    "the dominant contributions to @xmath62 come from low density , warm gas that is dominated by c@xmath22 cooling .",
    "the differences in the temperature distribution of the cold , denser material have little influence on @xmath62 .",
    "we find that @xmath62 varies by no more than 12% from run to run in both the low density and high density cases , thereby explaining why we see so little variation in the density pdf from run to run .",
    "our comparisons in the previous section have demonstrated that the g10 g , g10ng and nl99 models agree very well regarding the time evolution of the co abundance and the spatial distribution of the co. the most significant difference between the treatment of the carbon chemistry in these three models turns out to be the inclusion of grain - surface recombination in model g10 g , or more specifically , the recombination of c@xmath22 ions on grain surfaces . the inclusion of this process has a significant effect on the ratio of c@xmath22 to c in the gas , and therefore indirectly affects the temperature distribution , since c is a much more effective coolant than c@xmath22 at gas temperatures below 20  k.    the kc08e , kc08n and nl97 models also agree well with each other , but disagree with the g10 g , g10ng and nl99 models in two major respects .",
    "first , they predict a shorter formation timescale for the co , particularly in the high density run .",
    "second , they predict systematically larger values for the co fraction as a function of density or visual extinction",
    ". both of these disagreements between the two sets of models result from the same underlying cause . in the kc08e , kc08n and nl97 models ,",
    "the rate - limiting step in the formation of co is the initial radiative association between c@xmath22 and h@xmath0 , a reaction that has a rate coefficient @xmath37 in the nl97 model , and a similar value in the other two models . the rate per unit volume at which ch@xmath26 ions ( or ch@xmath25 radicals ) form in this model is therefore given by @xmath68 in the g10 g , g10ng and nl99 models , on the other hand , there are multiple routes leading to the formation of co and hence the situation is somewhat more complicated . in practice ,",
    "the main contributions come from two main reactions pathways , one initiated by the radiative association of c@xmath22 with h@xmath0 , as above , and a second initiated by the reaction of atomic carbon with h@xmath51 .",
    "the latter reaction occurs rapidly , and the rate - limiting step for this second reaction pathway is hence not the reaction between c and h@xmath51 , but rather the formation of the h@xmath51 ion itself .",
    "this occurs as a consequence of the cosmic ray ionization of h@xmath0 , which yields h@xmath26 ions that then rapidly react with h@xmath0 to form h@xmath51 : @xmath69 in regions where at least a few percent of the carbon is ionized , the free electron abundance is roughly equal to the abundance of ionized carbon , and the dominant destruction mechanism for the h@xmath51 ions is dissociative recombination : @xmath70 in these conditions , the net rate at which ch@xmath26 ions are produced by reactions between c and h@xmath51 is therefore given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the cosmic ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen , @xmath73 is the rate coefficient for the dissociative recombination of h@xmath51 ions and @xmath74 is the rate coefficient for the reaction @xmath75 in cold gas , @xmath76 , and hence @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "( recall that in our simulations , @xmath79 ) .",
    "the net rate of formation of ch@xmath26 ions in models g10 g , g10ng and nl99 is approximately equal to @xmath80 , since other processes make only minor contributions , while in models nl97 , kc08e and kc08n , the rate of formation of ch@xmath26 ions is simply @xmath81 .",
    "note , however , that since @xmath81 depends on @xmath35 , which is generally larger in models nl97 , kc08e and kc08n than in the other models , the size of the rate @xmath81 in the simple models is generally larger than in the more complex models . to avoid confusion ,",
    "it is useful to distinguish between these two cases by writing the rate in the simple models ( nl97 , kc08e , kc08n ) as @xmath82 and writing the rate in the more complex models ( nl99 , g10ng , g10 g ) as @xmath83 .",
    "we next consider the conditions in which the rate of ch@xmath26 formation in the complex models , given by @xmath84 , is bigger than the rate in the simple models , given by @xmath82 .",
    "starting with the inequality , @xmath85 we can subtract @xmath83 from both sides , giving us @xmath86 if we denote the number density of c@xmath22 in the simple models as @xmath87 , and denote the same quantity in the complex models as @xmath88 , then we can write this inequality as @xmath89 where we have assumed that the h@xmath0 abundance is the same in both cases .",
    "if the co abundance is small compared to the abundances of c@xmath22 and/or c , then in the simple models , the number density of c@xmath22 ions will be roughly equal to the number density of carbon atoms in all forms , i.e.  @xmath90 . in the complex models ,",
    "on the other hand , we have @xmath91 , and hence in these conditions @xmath92 .",
    "we can use this fact to simplify equation  [ ineq ] , which reduces to the following constraint on @xmath88 : @xmath93 in practice , this inequality is rarely satisfied in the gas in our simulations .",
    "for example , in solar metallicity gas with @xmath94 , it is satisfied only when the ratio of atomic to ionized carbon is of the order of a thousand to one .",
    "therefore , in general , the rate at which ch@xmath26 ions are produced in the more complex models is slower than the rate at which they are produced in the simpler models .",
    "this fact explains most of the difference that we see between our two sets of chemical models .",
    "when @xmath95 , all of the models produce ch@xmath26 ions ( and hence also co molecules ) at a very similar rate . in models g10 g , g10ng and nl99 , however , the physical conditions that allow large co fractions to be produced ( high density and high visual extinction ) also allow the recombination of c@xmath22 to be far more effective than the photoionization of atomic carbon , meaning that the equilibrium ratio of c to c@xmath22 in these regions strongly favours atomic carbon . as the carbon recombines ( which occurs on a timescale that is short compared to the co formation timescale ) , the co formation rate decreases for the reasons outlined above .",
    "the same effect does not occur in the nl97 , kc08e or kc08n models because none of these models include the effects of c@xmath22 recombination : model nl97 ignores atomic carbon entirely , while in models kc08e and kc08n , it is produced only by the photodissociation of co. therefore , the co formation rate in models nl97 , kc08e or kc08n is in general larger than in models g10 g , g10ng and nl99 , explaining the shorter co formation timescales and larger co fractions we find in the former models with respect to the latter .",
    "in this paper , we have examined several different approaches to modelling the chemistry of co in three - dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds . the simplest approaches ( nl97 , kc08n , kc08e ) include only a very small number of reactions and reactants , with the kc08e model making the additional simplifying assumption of chemical equilibrium .",
    "the nl99 adds a number of additional reactions and reactants , but still remains relatively simple , owing to its use of artifical species ( ch@xmath25 , oh@xmath25 ) as stand - ins for a much wider range of real molecular ions , radicals and molecules . finally , the most complex models examined here ( g10 g and g10ng ) add a few more non - equilibrium reactants , a large number of additional reactants that are assumed to be in chemical equilibrium , and a large number of additional reactions .",
    "the complexity of these two models lies close to the upper limit of what is practical to include in a three - dimensional simulation at present , but still represents a significant simplification when compared with state - of - the - art one - zone or one - dimensional chemical models ( see e.g.  the pdr codes discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "as one would expect , the simpler one makes the chemical model , the faster it becomes to compute the chemical evolution of the gas .",
    "models nl97 , kc08e and kc08n allow the simulations to run roughly an order of magnitude faster than the reference model , while model nl99 yields a runtime three times longer than the simple models , but still three to four times shorter than the models based on @xcite .",
    "looking in more detail at the results of the simple networks , we find that they tend to produce more co than the more complex networks , for the reasons outlined in the previous section .",
    "it is also clear that one area in which the simpler models fall down is in their treatment of atomic carbon .",
    "this is ignored entirely in the nl97 model , and is significantly underproduced in the kc08e and kc08n models , owing to the omission of the effects of c@xmath22 recombination from these models .",
    "it should however be noted that the @xcite chemical model was designed for use in a study of the thermal balance of prestellar cores with mean densities that are more than an order of magnitude larger than the mean densities considered in our simulations . in these conditions , the gas is co - dominated , atomic carbon is not an important coolant , and the @xcite model does a good job of capturing the essential physics of the gas .",
    "it performs more poorly in our study only because we are applying it to a range of physical conditions outside of those for which it was designed .",
    "turning our attention to the more complex networks , we find that models nl99 and g10ng produce very similar results in all of our comparisons , and that the differences between the results of these models and that of model g10 g are easily understandable as consequences of the inclusion of grain - surface recombination of c@xmath22 in the latter , which significantly affects the relative abundances of c and c@xmath22 produced in the gas .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of this process leads to a significant overproduction of atomic carbon and hence yields values for the c / co ratio that are significantly higher than those observed in real molecular clouds .",
    "models nl99 and g10ng , on the other hand , yield values for the c / co ratio that appear to be consistent with observations .    given that model nl99 produces very similar values to model g10ng for the c and co abundances , but in only one - third of the computational time",
    ", we suggest that the former is a better choice than the latter if one is primarily interested in the c@xmath22 to c to co transition , or in the details of the resulting co distribution .",
    "on the other hand , the more complex g10ng model is a better choice if one is also interested in the distributions of species not tracked in the nl99 model , such as ch , ch@xmath22 , oh , h@xmath0o or o@xmath0 , and is willing to pay the additional computational cost for tracking these species .",
    "furthermore , if all one is interested in is an approximate picture of which regions are likely to have high co abundances ( as may be of interest in a large - scale simulation of the galactic ism , such as @xcite ) , then _ any _ of these models are likely to do a reasonable job , as the differences between the co distributions that they predict are not enormous and are likely smaller than the uncertainties introduced by the inevitably limited resolution possible within large - scale simulations . for this kind of modelling",
    ", it would therefore make sense to choose one of the simpler , faster models , such as nl97 , kc08e or kc08n .",
    "finally , we have examined the effects of the choice of chemical network on the density and temperature distributions in our model clouds .",
    "we find that the influence of the chemistry is surprisingly limited .",
    "in both the low and the high density model clouds , much of the cloud volume is filled with warm gas ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "most of the carbon in this warm material is in the form of c@xmath22 , and hence c@xmath22 cooling dominates .",
    "all of the chemical networks that we examined do a good job of representing this material .",
    "the chemistry of the gas plays a significant role in determining the temperature only if one looks at colder , denser gas , with much higher c and co fractions , but even here , changing the chemistry changes the gas temperatures by at most a factor of two .",
    "these small temperature changes have little effect on the larger - scale gas dynamics , and so the resulting density pdf is the same regardless of which chemical model is adopted .",

    "our basic treatment of the thermal evolution of the gas is the same as in @xcite , and in the interests of avoiding duplication , we refer the reader interested in the full details of our model to that paper . in this appendix ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a discussion of the improvements we have made to the basic @xcite model . to briefly summarize ,",
    "we have made three changes .",
    "first , we have modified our treatment of the adiabatic index @xmath96 and the mapping from temperature to internal energy ( and vice versa ) to account for the fact that the internal energy levels of h@xmath0 are not excited at very low temperatures .",
    "second , we have relaxed the assumption made in @xcite and @xcite of a constant dust temperature , and now solve self - consistently for @xmath97 , thereby also improving the accuracy of our treatment of energy transfer from the gas to the grains .",
    "third , and finally , we have improved our treatment of co rotational cooling by extending the tabulated cooling function used in the code to lower temperatures .",
    "all three changes are discussed in more detail in the sections below .",
    "together , these changes dramatically improve the accuracy with which we can model very cold gas in our simulations , and allow us to remove the artificial temperature floor at @xmath98 that was adopted in our previous studies .",
    "we now should be able to accurately model the temperature of the gas down to values as low as 5  k , and we find in practice that there is very little gas below this temperature in any of our simulations",
    ".      the specific internal energy @xmath99 for an ideal gas with a temperature @xmath100 and a partition function @xmath10 can be written as @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the gas constant , @xmath103 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath104 is the proton mass and @xmath105 is the mean molecular weight ( in units of the proton mass ) . because the gas is ideal , its specific heat capacity at constant volume , @xmath106 , can be written as @xmath107 .",
    "many previous numerical studies of star formation have assumed that @xmath106 is independent of temperature , and hence that @xmath108 .",
    "unfortunately , this assumption is not true for molecular gas , as @xcite have recently pointed out . in very cold molecular gas ,",
    "essentially all of the @xmath109 molecules sit in the ortho or para ground state , and the gas behaves as if it were monatomic , with @xmath110 .",
    "however , as the temperature of the gas is increased , first the rotational and then the vibrational energy levels of @xmath109 become populated , and hence @xmath106 changes . for this reason , we do not assume a constant @xmath106 in these simulations .",
    "instead , we have constructed a set of lookup tables that give @xmath99 as a function of @xmath100 and @xmath111 ( the fractional abundance of @xmath109 ) , @xmath100 as a function of @xmath99 and @xmath111 , and the adiabatic index @xmath112 as a function of @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) and @xmath111 .",
    "whenever we must convert from @xmath99 to @xmath100 ( or vice versa ) , or require a value for @xmath96 , we compute it by interpolating between the values stored in these lookup tables . in constructing these tables ,",
    "we have assumed that the @xmath109 ortho - to - para ratio has its thermal equilibrium value .",
    "we have verified that by using this approach , we can reproduce the values shown for @xmath96 and @xmath113 in figures 1 & 2 of @xcite .",
    "however , we caution that the values for these quantities that are used in our actual simulations differ slightly from those in these figures , owing to the fact that we account for the presence of helium in the gas , whereas @xcite do not .      we assume ,",
    "as in most studies , that the dust is in thermal equilibrium and solve for the dust temperature @xmath114 by finding the value that satisfies the equation of thermal balance for the dust : @xmath115 here @xmath116 is the dust heating rate per unit volume due to absorption of radiation from the interstellar radiation field , @xmath117 is the radiative cooling rate of the dust , @xmath118 is the net rate at which energy is transferred from the gas to the dust by collisions , and @xmath119 is the dust heating rate per unit volume due to h@xmath0 formation on the grain surfaces .    to compute @xmath116 , we follow @xcite and express it as the product of a optically thin heating rate , @xmath120 , and a dimensionless factor , @xmath121 , that represents the attenuation of the interstellar radiation field by dust absorption : @xmath122 the optically thin heating rate is given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath125 is the gas density",
    ", @xmath126 is the mean specific intensity of the incident interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , and @xmath127 is the dust opacity in units of @xmath128 . for our isrf , we used the radiation field given in @xcite , which is a combination of data from @xcite at short wavelengths and @xcite at long wavelengths . for our dust opacities ,",
    "we use the values given in @xcite for grains that have not coagulated and that are coated with thick ice mantles .",
    "@xcite . in practice",
    ", however , our results for @xmath114 are not particularly sensitive to the particular choice of opacities from @xcite , and so we can safely ignore this complication . ]",
    "@xcite quote opacities only for wavelengths longer than @xmath129 , and at shorter wavelengths we use values taken from @xcite .",
    "finally , for @xmath124 we take the standard value for solar metallicity gas . with these choices",
    ", we find that @xmath130 where @xmath28 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "to compute the attenuation factor @xmath121 , we solve the equation @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath104 is the proton mass , and @xmath133 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "we solve this equation for a wide range of different values of @xmath133 , and tabulate the results . in our simulations",
    ", we can then calculate @xmath121 using our standard six - ray approximation . recall that this yields , for each zone in the simulation , the column density of material between the zone and the edge of the simulation volume along six rays that we take to be parallel to the coordinate axes , for convenience .",
    "we can associate a value of @xmath121 with each of these column densities , and the appropriate mean value to use in our calculation of the dust temperature is then simply the arithmetic mean of these values . by using an approach based on lookup tables , we avoid having to perform the frequency integration in equation  [ chi_func ] during the simulation itself , for a great saving in computational time . in figure",
    "[ fig : chi ] , we show how @xmath121 varies with @xmath133 for a wide range of values of the column density .    for the dust cooling rate @xmath117 , we solve @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the planck function for a temperature @xmath114 , and where our values for @xmath127 were the same as we used to calculate @xmath116 above .",
    "we find that the resulting cooling rate is well fit by the function @xmath136 for dust temperatures @xmath137 , which more than spans the range of values considered in this study .",
    "we do not account for the absorption by dust of its own thermal radiation when computing @xmath138 , as we do not follow the evolution of the gas to high enough densities for this effect to become important .",
    "finally , for the rate at which dust is heated by the formation of h@xmath0 on grain surfaces , @xmath119 , we have the expression @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the formation rate of h@xmath0 per unit volume @xcite , and @xmath143 is the fraction of the 4.48ev h@xmath0 binding energy that is absorbed by the grain . we assume , following @xcite , that @xmath144 .",
    "we have extended the range of temperatures for which we can calculate co cooling rates . in @xcite , we made use of the co cooling function developed by @xcite and @xcite and hence were limited by the range of their tabulated data , which covers the temperature range @xmath145  k for co rotational cooling . in our present study , we have extended their cooling function down to 5  k , using co de - excitation rates taken from @xcite and @xcite and made available in a convenient form by lamda , the leiden atomic and molecular database @xcite ."
