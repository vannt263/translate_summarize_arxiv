    "a large range of models have been proposed that predict new particles within the reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "since there is currently very little evidence for favoring one model over the others , it will be essential to analyze a potential new - physics signal in the lhc data in a model - independent approach , by independently determining the properties of each of the produced particles .",
    "recently , this idea has gained increased interest , and several groups have worked on constructing such model - independent setups for a number of different observable signatures , see @xmath14 refs .",
    "a particularly challenging scenario are processes that result in the production of new weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which are invisible to the detector .",
    "wimps are predicted in many models as hypothetical dark matter candidates . in these models ,",
    "the stability of the wimp is a consequence of some ( discrete ) symmetry , under which it is charged . as a result",
    ", it can be produced only in pairs at colliders , leading to challenging events with at least two invisible objects . at hadron colliders like the lhc",
    "there are not enough kinematical constraints in events of this type for the direct reconstruction of the momenta of all particles involved .",
    "one approach to this problem is motivated by the fact that models predict additional new particles , which can decay into the stable wimp . in this case",
    ", one can have cascade decay chains , which go through multiple decay steps before ending with the stable wimp , so that one can construct invariant - mass distributions of the visible decay products of this cascade .",
    "the kinematic endpoints of these distributions yield information about the masses @xcite of the new heavy particles , while the shape is sensitive to their spins @xcite . refs .",
    "@xcite have analyzed decay chains built up from a sequence of two - body decays in a model - independent way , by considering arbitrary spin assignments @xcite and also using general parametrizations for the coupling for the new particles @xcite .",
    "however , for scenarios with relatively small splittings in the mass spectrum of the new - physics particles , it can often happen that the last decay step is a three - body decay mediated by a heavier off - shell particle , see right - hand side of fig .",

    "[ tab : ll1 ] one can see that when only information about the @xmath46 distribution is available , it is difficult to distinguish the `` data '' a ( based on the spin configuration @xmath47=1 ) from the spin configurations @xmath47=26 .",
    "the underlying reason is that for each of these spin configurations there are three unknown continuous parameters , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath25 , which can be adjusted so as to mimic the data distribution .",
    "on the other hand , the spin configurations @xmath47=711 can be distinguished from `` data '' a with high significance , using only the @xmath46 distribution .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that there are no free parameters to adjust in @xmath50 for @xmath47=711 , and that these spin configurations correspond to a different diagram topology ( topology ii in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] instead of topology i ) .",
    "if both the @xmath46 and @xmath51 distributions are included in the fit , all possible spin configurations can be discriminated with at least six standard deviations , for the given number of 1000 events .    for the second example , it is evident from tab .",
    "[ tab : ll2 ] that `` data '' b can be distinguished from all other spin configurations @xmath47=110 by just using the @xmath46 distribution .",
    "in fact , for all combinations except @xmath47=8 and @xmath47=9 the significance for this discrimination is very high and is not improved substantially by including the @xmath51 distribution in the fit .",
    "also note that the best - fit results for @xmath47=16 are obtained for very large values of @xmath25 , since increasing values of @xmath25 shift the @xmath46 distribution toward larger values of @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ll ]  ( right ) , leading to better agreement with the reference case @xmath47=11 , see fig  [ fig : qllz ] .",

    "the inclusion of the @xmath51 distribution does not only lead to a constraint on @xmath52 ( which can not be obtained from @xmath50 ) , but also to improved bounds on @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "in this paper , a general analysis of three - body decays of the form @xmath54 , leading to a pair of opposite - sign leptons and one invisible particle @xmath3 , has been presented .",
    "this decay process can occur in many proposed new - physics models , either from direct production of the particle @xmath4 at the lhc , or from a cascade decay of the type @xmath28 , both of which have been studied here .",
    "no assumptions about the masses , spins and couplings of the participating new - physics particles have been made , including the off - shell particle @xmath22 mediating the three - body decay .",
    "instead , all possible spin configurations and coupling form factors have been considered .",
    "experimentally , the masses , spins and coupling parameters may be determined from measuring the invariant - mass distributions of the visible decay products .    in the present case , there are two independent distributions , one with respect to the di - lepton ( @xmath30 ) invariant mass , and the other with respect to the jet - lepton ( @xmath31 ) invariant mass",
    ". results for both have been obtained in terms of relatively compact analytical functions or one - dimensional integral representations .    in two concrete numerical examples ,",
    "it has been tested how well the properties of the new - physics particles @xmath3 , @xmath22 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be determined from these two invariant - mass distributions .",
    "it turns out that the di - lepton invariant - mass distributions alone is sometimes not sufficient to uniquely determine the spins and coupling parameters .",
    "however , if the longer two - step cascade decay chain is observed , and one can measure both the @xmath30 and @xmath31 invariant - mass distributions , it is possible to unambiguously discriminate between all possible spin configuration with high significance .",
    "furthermore , one can independently constrain all coupling parameters and the mass of the off - shell mediator @xmath22 , up to an intrinsic two - fold ambiguity .    the results presented here are based on a parton - level analysis . in a realistic experimental environment",
