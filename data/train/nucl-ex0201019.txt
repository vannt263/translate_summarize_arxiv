    "the main aim of the heavy ion program at the cern sps is to find and characterise the transition from confined hadronic matter to a transient deconfined state of strongly interacting matter . when sufficiently high initial energy density is reached the formation of a state of quasi free quarks and gluons , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is expected . to search for signs of such a transition the na49 experiment studies the hadronic observables of the collision for different beam energies ( 40 , 80 and 158  a@xmath4gev ) and different system sizes ( p+p , p+a , c+c , si+si and pb+pb at various centralities ) .",
    "strangeness production has been proposed as one possible signature for such a transition  @xcite .",
    "first experimental results from pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions at top sps ( 158  a@xmath4gev ) and top ags ( 11  a@xmath4gev ) energies have suggested that anomalies in strangeness production should take place between these energies @xcite which triggered the sps energy scan program @xcite . within this ongoing project",
    "na49 recorded central pb+pb collisions at 40 and 80  @xmath0gev during the heavy ion runs in 1999 and 2000 .",
    "the data at the top sps energy ( 158  a@xmath4gev ) was taken in previous runs . in this paper",
    "we report first results on the production of charged kaons in central pb+pb collisions at 80  a@xmath4gev and compare these new measurements with those from lower and higher energies .",
    "the na49 experimental set  up @xcite ( see figure  [ exp ] ) consists of four large volume time projection chambers ( tpcs )",
    ". two of them , vertex tpcs ( vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 ) , are placed in the magnetic field of two super - conducting dipole magnets and allow a precise measurement of particle momenta @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ( gev / c)@xmath7 ) and electric charge .",
    "the other two tpcs ( mtpc - l and mtpc - r ) , positioned downstream of the magnets , were optimised for high precision detection of ionization energy loss @xmath8 ( relative resolution of about 4% ) and consequently provide a means of measuring the particle mass .",
    "the tpc data yield spectra of identified hadrons above midrapidity .",
    "the particle identification capability of the mtpcs is augmented by two time of flight ( tof ) detector arrays ( resolution @xmath9 60 ps ) .",

    "the configuration at 158 a@xmath4gev was : b(vtpc-1 ) @xmath10 1.5 t and b(vtpc-2 ) @xmath10 1.1 t. the target , a thin lead foil ( 224 mg/@xmath11 ) , was positioned about 80 cm upstream from vtpc-1 .",
    "central collisions were selected by a trigger using information from a downstream calorimeter ( vcal ) , which measured the energy of the projectile spectator nucleons .",

    ". the @xmath43 ratio is monotonically increasing .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed for the midrapidity ratios .",
    "this different energy dependence of the @xmath44 and @xmath43 ratios could be attributed to their different sensitivity on baryon density .",
    "kaons ( @xmath20 and @xmath46 ) carry more than 80% ( or more than 90 % if only open strangeness is considered ) of all produced @xmath47-quarks .",
    "the @xmath20 yield is therefore nearly proportional to the total strangeness production .",
    "this picture changes if one looks at @xmath48-quarks , where only a much smaller fraction is carried by antikaons ( @xmath21 and @xmath49 ) whereas hyperons carry a significant fraction .",
    "if one assumes strangeness conservation ( i.e. the same amount of @xmath48 and @xmath47 quarks ) , the decreasing trend in the @xmath44 ratio above 40  @xmath0gev and the increase in the @xmath43 ratio should result in a decreasing hyperon to pion ratio .",

    "@xcite captures the trend of the data , however the decrease in the full phase space ratio between 40 and 158  @xmath0gev is not well reproduced .",
    "the measured @xmath44 ratio at 158  @xmath0gev is 25% lower than predicted by the model .",
    "the rqmd model @xcite predicts a monotonic increase of the @xmath44 ratio between top ags and top sps energies and overpredicts the measurement at 158  @xmath0gev by about 25% .",

    "are available , it shows a monotonic increase with energy .",
    "the schematic statistical model of the early stage @xcite assumes that a transition from a reaction with purely confined matter to a reaction with a qgp at the early stage occurs close to 40 a@xmath4gev .",
