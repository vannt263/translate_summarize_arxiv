    "this is easy if @xmath115 : the simplex @xmath116 with vertices @xmath117 has @xmath118 so the missed volume of the closure of @xmath119 , which is a lattice polytope , is @xmath120 .",

    "indeed , @xmath147 lies on one side of the hyperplane @xmath148 and all other simplices are on the other side .",
    "further , as @xmath123 and @xmath149 , every @xmath135 with @xmath146 is contained in the simplex whose vertices are @xmath150 and @xmath151 for @xmath152 , and these larger simplices are internally disjoint .",

    "this works even if @xmath135 is degenerate ; then @xmath165 .",
    "finally we have @xmath166 and the missed volume of @xmath20 is @xmath167    this finishes the construction and gives a polytope @xmath23 with @xmath114 if @xmath168 . @xmath107    the same construction with minor modification works for all @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",

    "the number of vertices of @xmath180 is estimated in @xcite as @xmath181    the vertices of @xmath180 are very close to the boundary of @xmath182 . more precisely , we have the following estimate which is also used in  @xcite .

    "we claim that @xmath202 only the lower bound needs some explanation .",
    "the number of vertices of @xmath180 with @xmath145 for some @xmath134 $ ] is less than @xmath11 times the number of vertices of @xmath203 which is of order @xmath204 .",

    "consequently all lattice points in @xmath211 are contained in @xmath212 and so @xmath213 .",
    "the result from @xcite cited above applies to @xmath214 and gives that @xmath215 as @xmath216 .",
    "this implies that with a suitable constant @xmath217 @xmath218    after these preparation we are ready for the proof of corollary  [ cor : main ] .",
    "given a ( large enough ) number @xmath2 with @xmath219 we are going to construct many non - equivalent convex lattice polytopes whose volume equals @xmath2 .",
    "as a first step , we define @xmath174 via the equation @xmath220    consider @xmath200 from the previous section .",

    "then @xmath240 \\cup p(z)=q(z)\\setminus \\left[s(r ) \\setminus p(z)\\right]\\ ] ] is a convex lattice polytope , and its volume is exactly @xmath2 .",
    "now we have @xmath241 convex lattice polytopes @xmath242 , each of volume @xmath2 .",
    "we claim that any one of them is equivalent to at most @xmath73 other @xmath243 .",

    "it is quite easy to check ( we omit the details ) that @xmath242 has exactly these @xmath11 edges whose length is larger than @xmath249 .",
    "so if @xmath242 and @xmath243 are equivalent , then the lattice preserving affine transformation @xmath250 that carries @xmath242 to @xmath243 , has to map each @xmath251 to a uniquely determined @xmath252 . as the lines containing @xmath251 all pass through the origin , @xmath253 and",

    "<S> we show by a direct construction that there are at least @xmath0 convex lattice polytopes in @xmath1 of volume @xmath2 that are different in the sense that none of them can be carried to an other one by a lattice preserving affine transformation . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by considering the family @xmath3 ( to be defined in the text ) of convex lattice polytopes whose volumes are between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . namely we prove that for @xmath6 , @xmath7 takes all possible integer values between @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant depending only on @xmath11 . </S>"
