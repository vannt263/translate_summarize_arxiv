    "in general relativity and cosmology , our knowledge about spatially homogeneous cosmological models has increased substantially over the years , and we are able to say that , for a large number of models , the qualitative behaviour of solutions is now well understood ; see  @xcite for an overview . the majority of results , however , concerns solutions of the einstein equations coupled to a perfect fluid ( usually with a linear equation of state ) .",
    "it is thus important to note that these results are in general not robust , i.e. , not structurally stable , under a change of the matter model ; significant changes of the qualitative behaviour of solutions occur , for instance , for collisionless matter .",
    "several fundamental results on spatially homogeneous diagonal models of bianchi type  i with collisionless matter have been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "diagonal locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) models have been investigated successfully by using dynamical systems methods , see  @xcite for the case of massless particles , and  @xcite for the massive case .",
    "in particular , solutions have been found whose qualitative behaviour is different from that of any perfect fluid model of the same bianchi type .",
    "the purpose of this article is to re - investigate the diagonal ( non - lrs ) bianchi type  i models with collisionless matter .",
    "our analysis is based on dynamical systems techniques , which enables us to obtain a more detailed picture of the global dynamics than the one previously given . in particular , we show that the dynamical behaviour toward the past singularity of the collisionless matter model differs considerably from the bianchi type  i perfect fluid model .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ einsteinvlasov ]",
    "we reformulate einstein s field equations for the diagonal bianchi type  i case with collisionless matter as a reduced dimensionless dynamical system on a compact state space . in section  [ invfixed ]",
    "we give the fixed points of the system and list and discuss a hierarchy of invariant subsets of the state space , which is associated with a hierarchy of monotone functions . in section  [ locglo ]",
    "we first present the results of the local dynamical systems analysis ; subsequently , we focus on the analysis of the global dynamics : we establish two theorems that formulate the future and past asymptotic behaviour of solutions , respectively . as regards the future asymptotics",
    "we show that all models isotropize asymptotically toward the future .",
    "the past asymptotic behaviour is more complicated since there exists several types of past asymptotic behaviour ; in particular we establish that the past attractive set resides on a set that contains a so - called heteroclinic network .",
    "the proof of the theorems is based on methods from global dynamical systems analysis ; in particular , we exploit the hierarchy of monotone functions in conjunction with the monotonicity principle .",
    "finally , in section  [ conc ] we conclude with some remarks about our results and their implications .",
    "appendix  [ dynsys ] provides a brief introduction to relevant background material from the theory of dynamical systems ; in particular we cite the monotonicity principle .",
    "the proofs of some of the statements in the main text are given in appendix  [ frwlrs ] and  [ futureproof ] . in appendix  [ si0space ]",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of one of the most important boundaries of our state space formulation .",

    "non - hyperbolic fixed points are treated in centre manifold theory : the reduction theorem generalizes the hartman - grobman theorem ; for further details see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "if a fixed point is an element of a connected fixed point set ( line , surface ,  ) and the number of eigenvalues with zero real parts is equal to the dimension of the fixed point set , then the fixed point is called transversally hyperbolic .",
