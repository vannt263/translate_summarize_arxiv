    "<S> spin - dependent electrical transport in magnetic tunnel junctions has received much attention both theoretically and experimentally in recent years ( see e.g. refs.@xcite for review ) . a new field dubbed as _ spintronics _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. spin - based electronics ) is emerging . among others </S>",
    "<S> one of the simplest devices in spintronics would be a ferromagnet - insulator - ferromagnet ( fm - i - fm ) structure which is comprised of two ferromagnetic electrodes separated by an insulator thin film . in 1975 jullire made the first observation of spin - polarized electrons tunneling through an insulator film into a ferromagnetic metal film , and clearly observed 14% tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) for fe / ge / co junctions at 4.2 k@xcite . in 1995 , moodera et al made a breakthrough that they observed over a 10% tmr for a co / al@xmath1o@xmath2/ni@xmath3fe@xmath4 junction reproducibly at room temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since then , there are a variety of works toward enhancing tmr in magnetic tunnel junctions , and the tmr @xmath5 has been obtained at room temperature@xcite . on the other hand , to understand the spin - polarized tunneling results for fm - i - fm junctions , people usually invoke the model based on a classical tunneling theory proposed by jullire@xcite , in which spins of electrons during tunneling are supposed to be conserved , namely , the tunneling of spin - up and spin - down electrons are two quite independent processes , and spin - flip scatterings are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> though jullire s two - current model can interpret well some experimental results qualitatively , it still faces to difficulties for more complex situations . actually , in some experiments spin conservation no longer holds , and the spin - flip scattering may take effect on the transport properties . </S>",
    "<S> there has been a number of experiments @xcite showing that tmr can be very various for different barriers , and the inverse tmr can even occur , namely , the resistance when the orientations of magnetizations of the two ferromagnets are parallel , is larger than that of antiparallel orientations . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the spin - flip scatterings might not be ignored in these situations . </S>",
    "<S> recently , vedyayev et al investigated a model including impurities in the middle of the barrier , and considered both cases of spin conserving scattering and spin - flip scattering@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . besides , jaffrs et al measured the angular dependence of the tmr for transition - metal based junctions , and observed that the angular response is beyond the simple cosine shape@xcite .    in this paper , based on a microscopic model and using the nonequilibrium green function technique we shall give a more general expression of the angular dependence of the tmr for fm - i - fm junctions by including the effect of spin - flip scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the effect of spin - flip scatterings gives rise to a correction to the formula of the usual tunnel conductance . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we have found that the spin - flip scattering induces a phase shift , leading to the tunnel conductance not to be the smallest when the magnetizations of the two fm electrodes are antiparallel , which may provide an alternative explanation for the previously experimental observation of the angular shift in some fm - i - fm tunnel junctions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has been shown that the spin - flip scattering could also lead to the inverse tmr effect under certain conditions though it is not the only factor , and the spin - flip assisted tunneling is also observed .    </S>",

    "<S> one may observe that there is an angular shift induced by the spin - flip scatterings , as to be discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us look at the angular dependence of the conductance @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> when the spin - flip scattering is neglected , i.e. @xmath77 , and if we further assume @xmath78 , we recover the conventional expression for the conductance @xmath79 which is familiar in literature@xcite , where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 @xmath82 is the usual polarization of the left ferromagnet , and @xmath83 when @xmath77 but @xmath84 , which implies that even if the spin - flip scattering is ignored , but the tunneling amplitude of electrons for the spin - up channel is different from that for the spin - down channel , we can also get in this situation an expression @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 although it looks seemingly like the conventional form , it is clear that the difference of the tunneling amplitudes for the two independent spin channels can still alter the magnitude of the conductance and the polarization as well .    on the other hand , the angular dependence of the tunnel conductance without considering the spin - flip effects , as mentioned before , </S>",
    "<S> is well known : @xmath88 with @xmath89 the conductance for parallel orientation of magnetizations in the two fm electrodes , and @xmath90 the conductance for the antiparallel orientation ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) . while in the present case , namely , with inclusion of the effect of spin - flip scatterings we find from eq.([g ] ) that the angular dependence of the conductance becomes    @xmath91    where @xmath92+d_{r\\downarrow } [ t_{2}^{2}d_{l\\uparrow } + t_{4}^{2}d_{l\\downarrow } ] \\}$ ] , @xmath93+d_{r\\downarrow } [ t_{1}^{2}d_{l\\uparrow } + t_{3}^{2}d_{l\\downarrow } ] \\},$ ] and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> one may see that apart from the conventional @xmath95 and @xmath96 terms there is an additional third term proportional to @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> here we should point out that @xmath98 is the conductance in the case of the parallel alignment ( @xmath99 ) for the magnetizations of the two ferromagnets , @xmath100 is corresponding to the antiparallel case ( @xmath101 ) , and @xmath102 gives an additional term for the noncollinear case ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) , which disappears in the collinear cases . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , these three coefficients @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) contain the contributions from the spin - flip scatterings characterized by @xmath107 and @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> it is the effect of spin - flip scatterings that enables the tunnel conductance not to be at the minimum when the magnetizations of the two ferromagnets are antiparallel . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable , because the spin - flip scattering process violates the spin conservation and can enable electrons in the spin - up band of one fm electrode tunneling through the insulator barrier into the spin - down band of another fm electrode , and vice versa , thereby giving rise to a phase shift , as shown in eq.([g ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is emphasized that this shift will disappear when the effect of spin - flip scattering is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g ] ) and ( [ g - flip ] ) can be viewd as a generalization of the conventional expression for the tunnel conductance [ see eq.([g - conven ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the phenomenon of such an angular shift has been experimentally observed for a cofe / al@xmath1o@xmath2/co tunnel junction , as presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see fig.4 therein ) , where the maximum of the junction resistance appears at @xmath109 , not @xmath110 , implying the angular shift @xmath111 @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> although the authors of ref.@xcite did not mention the reasons why such an angular shift occurs in this fm - i - fm junction , in accordance with the aforementioned analysis we may attribute this phenomenon possibly to the effect of the spin - flip scatterings . if this is acceptable , we can in turn infer the magnitude of the effect of spin - flip scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> to show it explicitly , let us assume @xmath113 and @xmath114 for simplicity , and define a parameter @xmath115 which characterizes the magnitude of the effect of spin - flip scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> the angular shift @xmath116 versus the parameter @xmath117 is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that @xmath116 is monotonously increasing with increasing @xmath118 when @xmath117 approaches to @xmath119 , @xmath116 @xmath120 which can be obtained from the expression of @xmath121 ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath122 , then @xmath121 can be negative , leading to @xmath123 larger than @xmath124 . to see more clearly the effect of spin - flip scatterings on the conductance , we note that @xmath125 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g ] ) can be written as @xmath126 . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath127 , and @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath117-dependence of the conductance is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( a ) .  </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the conductance decreases with increasing @xmath117 when the magnetizations in the two ferromagnets are parallel , while it increases for the antiparallel alignment . as @xmath129 </S>",
    "<S> , one may observe that @xmath130 , suggesting that the inverse tmr may occur . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of noncollinear alignments , with increasing @xmath117 the conductance first increases rapidly and then decreases , and some peaks appear around @xmath131 .    we come to consider the effect of spin - flip scatterings on the tmr . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a number of experiments@xcite for a few fm - i - fm tunnel junctions show that if the insulator thin film is the material which differs from al@xmath1o@xmath132 such as srtio@xmath2 , ce@xmath133la@xmath134o@xmath135 and so on , the tmr , defined as usual as @xmath136 will be negative under certain conditions , which means @xmath137 exhibiting the so - called inverse tmr effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally believed that this effect may originate from the electronic states at the interface between a ferromagnetic layer and an insulating layer@xcite which could give rise to the density of states in the minority spin band larger than that in the majority spin band at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> however , one may see below that the spin - flip scattering can also contribute to the inverse tmr . from ( [ g ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we find that the tmr still has the apparently standard form @xmath138 but @xmath121 , defined after eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g ] ) and containing the contribution from spin - flip scatterings , differs from the conventional polarization @xmath139 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , moodera et al calculated the tmr for the cofe / al@xmath1o@xmath2/co junction according to the jullire@xmath0s formula . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated result is @xmath140 , while the experiment value is @xmath141 at @xmath142 @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> if we adopt this experimental data , we can calculate the contribution of the spin - flip scatterings which is characterized by the parameter @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained result for @xmath117 is about @xmath144 , where the spin polarization of electrons is taken as @xmath145 for cofe and @xmath146 for co@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the spin - flip scatterings might have a considerable effect on the electrical transport of this tunnel junction . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , if we take the contribution from the spin - flip scatterings into account , then we can apply our formula to estimate the value of tmr , which could be closer to the experimental result than using jullire@xmath0s formula . </S>",
    "<S> if the tunneling amplitudes satisfy a certain condition , @xmath121 can be negative , depending on the difference between @xmath147 and @xmath148 , resulting in that the tmr can be negative . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath117-dependence of the tmr is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the tmr decreases with increasing @xmath117 , and becomes negative for @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood in the following . for @xmath149 , </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling amplitude for the two independent channels ( @xmath150 ) is larger than the tunneling amplitude for the spin - flip channel ( @xmath107 ) . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the spin - flip scatterings the polarization @xmath121 becomes effective and small , leading to decreasing of the tmr . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath122 , i.e. , the tunneling amplitude for the two independent channels is smaller than that for the spin - flip channel , the spin - flip scattering dominates in the tunneling process , implying that the electrons with spin up in the left fm electrode can tunnel through the insulator barrier to occupy the states of electrons with spin down in the right fm electrode via the spin - flip mechanism , thereby giving rise to contribution to the inverse tmr effect .    </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence of the tmr can be understood from the following definition    @xmath151    when @xmath6 @xmath152 @xmath116 , the tmr goes to its maximum which will be denoted by @xmath153 hereafter . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , the @xmath117-dependence of the maximum tmr , i.e. @xmath153 , is presented . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable property is that @xmath153 has a peak at @xmath117 @xmath154 @xmath155 , which migh be a result of the spin - flip assisted tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that @xmath153 approaches to a constant when @xmath117 increases to a large value . </S>",
