    "<S> we compute the nuclear suppression factor @xmath0 for charged hadrons within a radiative energy loss picture using a hydrodynamical evolution to describe the soft medium inducing energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> a minijet + saturation picture provides initial conditions for lhc energies and leading order perturbative qcd ( lo pqcd ) is used to compute the parton spectrum before distortion by energy loss .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the suppression of hard hadrons induced by the presence of a soft medium produced in central pb - pb collisions at @xmath1 tev at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> note that this prediction depends on knowledge of the medium . in the present calculation , </S>",
    "<S> the medium evolution is likewise predicted and has to be confirmed before the suppression can be tested . </S>",
    "<S> note further that the calculation is only valid where hadron production is dominated by fragmentation and that it can not be generalized to the suppression of jets since the requirement of observing a hard hadron leads to showers in which the momentum flow is predominantly through a single parton . </S>",
    "<S> this is not so for jets in which the momentum flow is shared on average among several partons ( which requires a different framework ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we describe the soft medium evolution by the boost - invariant hydrodynamical model discussed in @xcite where the initial conditions for lhc are computed from perturbative qcd+saturation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation for the propagation of partons through the medium follows the bdmps formalism for radiative energy loss using quenching weights @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details of the implementation can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability density @xmath2 for finding a hard vertex at the transverse position @xmath3 and impact parameter @xmath4 is given by the normalized product of the nuclear profile functions . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the energy loss probability @xmath5 for any given path from a vertex through the medium by evaluating the line integrals @xmath6 along the path where we assume the relation @xmath7 between the local transport coefficient @xmath8 , the energy density @xmath9 and the local flow rapidity @xmath10 as given in the hydrodynamical model . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath11 is between flow and parton trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> we view the constant @xmath12 as a tool to account for the uncertainty in the selection of @xmath13 and possible non - perturbative effects increasing the quenching power of the medium ( see @xcite ) and adjust it such that pionic @xmath0 for central au - au collisions at rhic is described . </S>",
    "<S> the result for lhc is then an extrapolation with @xmath12 fixed .    using the numerical results of @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 . from this distribution </S>",
    "<S> given a single path , we can define the averaged energy loss probability distribution @xmath17 by averaging over all possible paths , weighted with the probability density @xmath2 for finding a hard vertex in the transverse plane .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider all partons as absorbed whose energy loss is formally larger than their initial energy . the momentum spectrum of produced partons is calculated in lo pqcd . </S>",
    "<S> the medium - modified perturbative production of hadrons is obtained from the convolution @xmath18 with @xmath19 the fragmentation function . from this </S>",
    "<S> we compute the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 as @xmath20    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] shows the expected behaviour of @xmath0 with hadronic transverse momentum @xmath21 at midrapidity . on quite general grounds </S>",
    "<S> , we expect a rise of @xmath0 with @xmath21 for any energy loss model in which the energy loss probability does not strongly depend on the initial parton energy as more of the shift in energy becomes accessible ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed form of the rise is then sensitive to the form of @xmath17 . </S>"
