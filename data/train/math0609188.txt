    "<S> ( this result implies the previous combinatorial results . ) however , our proof relied on the _ matrix ansatz _ of derrida _ et al _ @xcite , and hence did not give an intuitive explanation of why one should expect the steady state distribution of the pasep to involve such nice combinatorics .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we define a markov chain  which we call the pt chain  on the set of permutation tableaux which _ projects _ to the pasep , in a sense which we shall make precise . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a new proof of the main result of @xcite which bypasses the matrix ansatz altogether . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , via the bijection of @xcite , the pt chain can also be viewed as a markov chain on the symmetric group . </S>",
    "<S> another nice feature of the pt chain is that it possesses a certain symmetry which extends the _ particle - hole symmetry _ of the pasep . </S>"
