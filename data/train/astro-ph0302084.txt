    "the center of our galaxy appears to host a very massive black hole ( e.g. , genzel 2000 , ghez et al . 2000 ) identified with the compact radio source sgr  a@xmath1 ( e.g. reid et al . 1999 ) , with @xmath2 .",
    "one mystery of sgr  a@xmath1 is the fact that its bolometric ( mostly radio ) luminosity is very low , i.e. @xmath3 of the corresponding eddington luminosity @xmath4 whereas its quiescent x - ray emission is even dimmer than radio : @xmath5 ( baganoff et al . 2001b ; for a review of sgr  a@xmath1 see melia & falcke 2001 and markoff et al .",
    "2001 on the role of the jet ) .",
    "this is puzzling because there is enough hot gas observed at @xmath6 parsec from sgr  a@xmath1 core to let the black hole radiate some @xmath7 orders of magnitude more ( baganoff et al .",
    "the current favorite explanation of this aspect of sgr  a@xmath1 are accretion flow solutions ( narayan & yi 1994 ; narayan 2002 ) that radiate extremely little compared to the standard disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "however for `` our '' black hole to grow so massive there should have been a much more vigorous accretion activity in the past .",
    "such an activity is usually assumed to proceed via the thin standard disk and cease when the supply of matter ends .",
    "note that practically independently of the exact value of the specific angular momentum of the accreting material , @xmath8 , above the threshold value of @xmath9 , an accretion disk will develop over a broad range of radii because matter in the disk flows in and out ( kolykhalov & sunyaev 1980 ) .",
    "@xmath10 here is the gravitational radius , i.e. , @xmath11 cm .",
    "a `` light '' and very cold ( @xmath12 k ) inactive disk may remain there essentially indefinitely because its viscosity is extremely low .",
    "nayakshin ( 2002 ) recently suggested that there is such a disk in sgr  a@xmath1 and that it is draining the heat from the hot gas by thermal conduction .",
    "instead of flowing into the black hole the hot gas in this model settles down ( condensates ) onto the inactive disk at large distances .",
    "the accretion of the hot gas is thus delayed in this picture which then would explain the low luminosity of sgr  a@xmath13 .",
    "sgr  a@xmath1 is believed to be closely related to the low luminosity agn ( llagn ; e.g. ho 1999 ) . most if not all of these sources seem to have cold disks that often can be seen only through water maser emission ( e.g. miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) arising in a range of radii where gas temperature is @xmath14 k ( neufeld & maloney 1995 ) .",
    "these disks also seem to miss their innermost parts ( quataert et al . 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately our gc is an extremely `` low luminosity '' llagn and an inactive disk can be very hard to detect .",
    "in particular , a thermally emitting inactive accretion disk with @xmath15 k and @xmath16 is dim enough not to violate the quiescent bolometric luminosity constraints .",
    "in addition , disks of such low temperature are razor - thin , i.e. @xmath17 . if the disk happened to be oriented nearly edge - on to us , it would be very difficult to spot it via its _ quiescent _ emission",
    ".    however there seems to be as many as @xmath18 stars in the central arcsecond ( @xmath19 pc @xmath20 cm ) of the galaxy . the orbits of brightest of these stars ( b and possibly o type ; gezari et al .",
    "2002 ) are now being precisely mapped ( e.g. schdel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "these stars may be eclipsed by the disk if it is optically thick .",
    "in addition , even much smaller and much less luminous solar - type stars will produce x - ray and near infra - red flares when passing through the disk . in this letter we hope to present a concise but clear overview of our ongoing work on the star - disk interactions near gc ( nayakshin , cuadra & sunyaev 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "a star can be eclipsed when it moves into the area shadowed by the disk as seen from our line of sight .",
    "if the star moves `` far '' behind the disk then this type of eclipses is completely analogous to the eclipses of sun by the moon and can be referred to as a `` blocking eclipse '' . as such it happens because both the blocked and the blocking objects have finite sizes .",
    "the star may instead strike the disk , pass through it , and become eclipsed because it moved from the front / visible side of the disk to its back / invisible side .",
    "this type of eclipses may be referred to as an `` impact eclipse '' .    in figure ( [ fig : fig1 ] ) we show two star trajectories interesting in terms of eclipses and flares .",
    "the star moving along the abcd path is eclipsed by the disk twice per orbit . in point",
    "b the star does not physically intercepts the disk but only its shadow , and hence this is the beginning of a blocking eclipse . due to the star s finite size and ( most likely ) a gradual rather than an abrupt nature of the disk edge on both the inner and the outer boundaries , partial eclipses could be observed for hours to months ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "the eclipse ends at point c when the star goes through the disk , from its back to its front side .",
    "nir infra - red and an x - ray flare will be emitted ( see figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "_ if the disk is optically thick _ to x - rays , then nir flare will precede the x - ray flare .",
    "the former is thermal in nature and is strongest when the star is in the disk midplane , whereas the latter can only reach the observer when the star is in the disk photosphere ( see  [ sec : scheme ] ) .",
    "the cd part of the trajectory is an `` unremarkable '' quiescent star emission , which terminates when the star hits the disk for the second time .",
    "this time the x - ray flare should be emitted first .",
    "the eclipsed part da ends when the star emerges from the disk shadow without a flare .",
    "to date , there is only one star whose orbit is nearly completely known , i.e. the star s2 ( schdel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the orbit is highly elliptical ( eccentricity @xmath21 ) , inclined at @xmath22 ( we picked the @xmath23 sign here ) , and the period is 15.2 years .",
    "we plot ( figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) the orbit of s2 and a disk that does _ not _ eclipse any of the measured positions ( fig . 1 in schdel et al .",
    "note that the disk can in principle still exist beyond @xmath24 or @xmath25 but it can not be optically thick there .",
    "figure ( [ fig : fig4 ] ) shows the expected lightcurve of the star ( the passage of the periblackhole radius for s2 occured at 2002.3 ) . the eclipse @xmath26 ( @xmath27 )",
    "is of the blocking type and therefore there is no flare associated with it , whereas the second eclipse ( point @xmath28 ) begins with a flare .",
    "figures ( [ fig : fig3 ] & [ fig : fig4 ] ) are only examples . we find that a disk with no inner hole or a disk with a larger inner hole , @xmath29and an arbitrarily large outer radius are also possible for the present data ( cuadra et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .    a brief summary of what one can learn from observations of star eclipses and flares :    1 .",
    "coordinates of star s trajectories are three - dimensional ; therefore , star - disk crossing points ( e.g. d or c ) yield 3d coordinate of a point in the disk .",
    "together with the known coordinates of sgr  a@xmath1 itself , any such crossing yields a line in the disk plane .",
    "therefore , knowledge of 3d coordinates of points d & f , for example , ( and sgr  @xmath30 ) is sufficient to determine the plane of the disk rotation .",
    "if the plane of the disk is known , then the projected coordinates of two blocking points ( a & b ) uniquely determine the outer disk radius ( unless the disk is strongly warped ) .",
    "3 .   appearance or disappearance of stars ( in blocking points ) will be gradual and this should yield information on how the disk is terminated on both boundaries .",
    "the maximum luminosity of a flare is a strong function of the angle between the star and the disk velocity at the point of impact (  [ sec : scheme ] ) , @xmath31 .",
    "hence one can tell whether the disk is rotating clockwise or counter - clockwise in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the best constraints here are offered by a star whose orbital plane is close to the disk plane .",
    "5 .   in general",
    ", a star that is on an elliptical orbit and that strikes the disk twice per orbit , will do so at different radii from the black hole ( e.g. f is farther from the center than e in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , so the flare durations , amplitudes and spectra will be different .",
    "such events will offer better constraints on the variation of the disk density and temperature with @xmath32 than will flares from separate stars .",
    "currently orbits of only the bright stars can be followed in sgr  a@xmath1 star cluster .",
    "these stars have radii @xmath33 and hence should yield very large x - ray and nir flares ( see  [ sec : scheme ] ) .",
    "of course such flares are much less frequent than the typical flares from stars with @xmath34 .",
    "reader not interested in physical or mathematical detail of our model for the star - disk flares may proceed directly to  3.1 and figure ( [ fig : fig5 ] ) where star - disk flare properties are summarized .    at a distance @xmath32 from the black hole ,",
    "let a star with mass @xmath35 and radius @xmath36 move with velocity @xmath37 that makes angle @xmath31 with the disk circular keplerian velocity , @xmath38 .",
    "we also define for convenience @xmath39 .",
    "the relative velocity of the disk and the star , @xmath40 is essential for the problem . in general @xmath41 , and one needs to carry out calculations for arbitrary @xmath37 and @xmath31 and then integrate over the star s 3d velocity distribution . in what follows",
    "we simply assume that @xmath42 . under the assumption of an isotropic star cluster the `` average '' angle",
    "@xmath31 is equal to @xmath43 , so @xmath44 .",
    "however we shall keep in mind the importance of the actual @xmath37 and @xmath31 for exact results ( cf .",
    "point iv above ) .",
    "the star s internal density is very much larger than that of the disk and we can consider the star to be a rigid solid body ( see syer et al . 1991 ) .",
    "we neglect tidal effects and accretion of gas onto the stellar surface because the corresponding bondi radius is much smaller than @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the mach number of the star in the disk is about @xmath47 .",
    "thus the star drills a narrow hole in the disk ( syer et al .",
    "1991 ) note also that @xmath48 .",
    "the star is essentially a piston moving into the gas and the rate at which the star makes work on the gas in the disk is approximately @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the midplane density of hydrogen nuclei .",

    "the infrared opacity of dust is @xmath129 @xmath88/gm ( fig 3b in pollack et al .",
    "the disk is optically thin in nir for @xmath130 .",

    "[ lmax ] ) .",
    "4 .   the maximum",
    "nir 2 @xmath131 m luminosity for solar - type stars is @xmath132 erg / sec .",
    "such flares can not be detected because the current limit on nir flares ( hornstein et al . 2002 ) is about @xmath133 mjy or @xmath134 erg / sec .",
    "further , the flares are actually offset from sgr  a@xmath1 location by @xmath135 0.1 .",
    "if detected they would probably appear as `` noise '' not associated with sgr  a@xmath1 itself .",
    "5 .   similar x - ray and nir flares from star - disk interactions in more distant llagn with @xmath136 have smaller luminosities ( typically @xmath137 ) . in accord with this ,",
    "no such x - ray flares have yet been observed in other llagn .",
    "radio emission from the shocked gas is very weak ( compared to the nir or x - ray luminosities ) since it is completely self - absorbed .",
    "this explains why there is no radio flares correlated with x - ray outbursts in sgr  a@xmath13 .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of the o - type stars can be as high as @xmath138 erg / sec .",
    "passing through the disk their radiation will form a strong ionization front and will be reprocessed into a cooler thermal emission .",
    "the emission will be coming from a larger surface area than @xmath139 .",
    "the flare nir k - band luminosity should be much larger than the star quiescent emission ( in the same band ) .",
    "the luminous stars produce powerful winds with mass loss rates as high as @xmath140 per year .",
    "the optical depth to free - free absorption in radio frequencies , @xmath141 , can be significant .",
    "estimating density in the wind a distance @xmath142 from the star as @xmath143 , we obtain @xmath144^{-2}\\ ; [ \\tilde{r}/10^{13 } \\;\\hbox{cm}]^{-3}\\ ; , \\label{tff}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is wind temperature in units of @xmath146 k , and @xmath147 km / sec , and @xmath148 per year .",

    "unfortunately probability of this event is extremely low because there are very few ( if any ! ) of such stars within small enough distance from sgr  a@xmath13 .",
    "a much more likely effect is a star passing through the jet",
    ". the jet emission can be either enhanced ( via providing seed photons from the star ) or reduced ( via providing too many seed photons which over - cool the jet electrons ) .",
    "the rate of such `` jet - crossing '' events is roughly @xmath149 times smaller than that for the star - disk crossings , where @xmath150 is the jet opening angle .",
    "for example , for @xmath151 the rate is 1/60 of that given by eq .",
    "( [ er ] ) , i.e. @xmath152 year@xmath153 . however since sgr  a@xmath1 radio power is much greater than its quiescent x - ray emission only the brightest stars are likely to cause jet disturbance",
    ". therefore one may expect probably few events per year .",
    "the duration of the event is much longer than that of x - ray flares , i.e. @xmath154 i.e. weeks to years depending on the distance @xmath32 .",
    "interestingly , zhao et al . ( 2001 ) recently reported discovery of a 106 day periodicity in the radio emission of sgr  a@xmath13 .",
    "we have shown that eclipses of close stars by the disk may be a very effective tool with which to constrain the disk s plane and direction of rotation , inner and outer radii , and the optical depth variation with radius .",
    "the predicted x - ray and nir flares may yield additional constraints on the properties of the disk .",
    "the disk density is the only parameter of the model that is completely free ; all the others  the star s radii , number density , disk size , temperature and inclination angle have certain limitations from observations of either stellar orbits near sgr  a@xmath1 or its quiescent emission .",
    "it is thus remarkable that a disk with midplane density @xmath155 @xmath66 produces x - ray flares with `` right '' duration , x - ray luminosity , spectrum , and low enough nir and radio emission to pass all of the observational constraints on sgr  a@xmath1 flares .",
    "if the inactive disk indeed exists , it is necessary to understand how it interacts with the hot ( adaf - type ) flow .",
