    "the bl lac object mkn 501 ( @xmath10.034 ) underwent a major outburst in x - ray and in the vhe bands during 1997 .",
    "observations with the x - ray telescopes on board the bepposax and the rxte satellites showed , compared to earlier data , a flux increase at several kev by up to one order of magnitude and a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaking frequently at very high energies , namely in the energy range above @xmath225  kev ( pian et al .",
    "@xcite ; lamer & wagner @xcite ) . in the vhe band mkn 501 was the brightest known source in the sky showing dramatic flux variability from a fraction to approximately @xmath210 times the flux of the crab nebula ( aharonian et al .",

    "@xcite , called a99b in the following ) . the high energy nonthermal continuum emission of bl lac objects is widely believed to originate in a relativistic jet due to a population of high energy electrons , emitting synchrotron radiation at longer wavelengths and higher energy photons in inverse compton ( ic ) processes of the highest energy electrons with lower energy seed photons ( see for recent reviews coppi @xcite ; sikora @xcite ; ulrich et al .",
    "the origin of the ic seed photons has not yet been established . in so - called `` synchrotron self compton '' ( ssc )",
    "models the target photon population is dominated by low energy synchrotron photons ( e.g.  bloom & marscher @xcite ; ghisellini et al .",
    "@xcite ; mastichiadis & kirk @xcite ) . in `` external compton '' models",
    "the seed photons originate outside the emission volume and are , e.g.  radiation from the nuclear continuum scattered or reprocessed in the broad - line regions ( see e.g.  sikora et al .",
    "@xcite ) or accretion disc photons ( dermer & schlickeiser @xcite ) . simultaneous observations of the highest energy synchrotron photons in the x - ray band and of the highest energy ic photons in the vhe band make it possible to infer complementary information about the rapidly evolving population of highest energy electrons . besides studies of large populations of similar sources , only detailed studies of the temporal and spectral characteristics of individual sources over a broad wavelength region promise to yield sufficient constraints to unambiguously identify the mechanism responsible for the observed emission . a further necessity to study in detail",
    "the temporal emission characteristics arises from the fact that the observed vhe @xmath0-ray spectra are expected to be substantially modified by the intergalactic extinction due to pair production processes of the vhe photons with the diffuse extragalactic background radiation ( debra ) ( nikishov @xcite ; gould & schrder @xcite ; stecker et al .",
    ". the temporal analysis should yield enough redundant information not only to identify the emission mechanism but also to determine the jet parameters making it possible to infer the electron spectrum from its x - ray synchrotron emission and to predict the intrinsic vhe spectrum .",
    "the comparison of the intrinsic and the observed spectra yields the intergalactic extinction and as a consequence an estimate of the debra density in the relatively unconstrained 0.5  @xmath3 m to 50  @xmath3 m wavelength region .",
    "the observations with the hegra stereoscopic system of cherenkov telescopes of 1997 showed that the mkn 501 time - averaged vhe energy spectrum extends to energies well above 10  tev and made it possible to sample an energy spectrum with an exponential cutoff deeply into the exponential regime ( a99b ) . from 500  gev to @xmath220  tev the spectrum can be described by a power law model with an exponential cutoff : @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we will study in detail the question whether the cutoff is caused by intergalactic extinction or by the emission mechanism itself .",
    "note that the hegra telescope system achieves an energy flux sensitivity @xmath5 at 1  tev of 10@xmath6 for 1 hour of observation time .",

    "the analysis on a time scale of days shows that the time lag is smaller than one day ( fig .",

    "[ xtdcf]b does not yet allow definitive conclusions about the existence of such a time lag in mkn  501 .",
    "one of the most interesting questions is whether the x - ray and vhe spectral indices are correlated .",
    "the x - ray spectral index for all nights with vhe observations varies only by 0.25 which equals to a good approximation the median accuracy of the hegra spectral index estimates .",
    "we draw the very important conclusion that vhe spectral variations with spectral changes comparable to the ones observed by rxte are not excluded by the hegra data .",
    "the statistical accuracy of the hegra spectral estimates can be improved by determining average spectra for several days . a closer look at the rxte spectral indices however shows that the mean spectral index of a sufficient large number of days varies by not more than @xmath170.1 , a spectral difference which is again difficult to assess at tev energies . in our best",
    "try we grouped together hegra observations according to an rxte spectral index below and above 0.85 , with mean spectral indices which differ by 0.1 .",
    "the hegra data gives a 1 - 5  tev spectral index of 1.20@xmath180.02@xmath21 for the data sample with harder x - ray spectra , and 1.28@xmath180.04@xmath21 for the data sample with softer x - ray spectra .",
    "a difference of the vhe spectral indices of the same magnitude as at x - ray energies seems likely but the statistical evidence is marginal .",
    "to summarize , the variations of the rxte spectral indices are rather small compared to the accuracy of the hegra spectral estimates and the data supports rather than excludes a correlation of the x - ray / vhe spectral indices .",
    "this is consistent with recent claim of the cat group who reported that the joint spectrum of the data of the two strongest april flares , was harder than the 1997 mean spectrum ( djannati - atai et al .",
    "in this section we first discuss possible ssc scenarios for explaining the 1997 mkn  501 x - ray and vhe characteristics and discuss the constraints on the model parameters ( sect .",
    "[ sscmodel ] ) .",

    "[ debramodel ] ) to infer information about the intergalactic extinction caused by the debra ( sect .",
    "[ debraresult ] ) .",
    "note that the quadratic dependence of the vhe ( probably ic ) @xmath0-ray fluxes on the x - ray ( probably synchrotron ) fluxes shown in fig .",
    "[ xtcorr ] favors a ssc scenario in which the production of seed photons is closely connected to the production of the nonthermal electron population .      in the following a `` one zone model ''",
    "is used for simplicity ; the synchrotron and ic radiations originate in a spherical emission volume homogeneously filled with an isotropic population of relativistic electrons which move in a magnetic field characterized by its mean value @xmath22 .    in the first scenario ( `` scenario 1 '' ) , the emission volume is characterized by a constant doppler factor ( @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the bulk lorentz factors of the emitting volume and @xmath26 the angle to the observer ) , a rather constant magnetic field @xmath22 , and a slightly variable radius .",
    "while the spectrum of accelerated electrons does not change with time , only the variability of the rate of accelerated particles entering the emission region causes the observed x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray variability .",
    "the x - ray synchrotron spectrum hardens when a large amount of freshly accelerated particles enters the emission region ( i.e. during the rising stage of a flare ) and subsequently steepens due to the cooling of these particles ( i.e.  during the decaying stage of a flare ) .",
    "a continuously changing x - ray spectral index is expected in this scenario if the cooling time of electrons responsible for the x - ray radiation is comparable to the flux variability time scale .",
    "we envisage that the electrons responsible for the low energy x - ray emission ( below 1kev or so ) have no time to cool before they escape the emission region and as a consequence the spectra are always very hard in this energy region .",
    "by contrast , at energies above @xmath27  kev most often soft spectra are observed due to the rapid cooling of the responsible electrons .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration predicts a power law spectrum of nonthermal particles @xmath28 with @xmath29 which is steepened at higher energies by one unit ( @xmath30 ) due to synchrotron cooling .",
    "therefore , the produced synchrotron radiation has a spectrum with @xmath31 with @xmath32 in the low energy region and with @xmath33 in the high energy region .",
    "indeed , the mkn 501 spectra observed with bepposax during april 1997 show for all three days a spectrum @xmath34 with an spectral index @xmath35 below several kev , and @xmath36 above @xmath3725  kev .",
    "furthermore , observations with osse taken between april 9th to april 15th , 1997 showed a hard 50  kev to @xmath2470  kev spectrum characterized by a spectral index @xmath38 of 1.1 ( catanese et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this scenario",
    "the x - ray spectral index is determined by the temporal evolution of the density of emitting particles rather than by the density itself . as a consequence",
    ", the correlation of the x - ray and vhe spectral indices should be tighter than the correlation of the absolute vhe fluxes and vhe spectral indices , in accord with the results shown in the previous section .",
    "assuming an escape time of the low energy electrons smaller than several days , the ic seed photon density approximately follows the rate of injected particles and a faster than linear ( but not necessarily quadratic ) rise of the vhe fluxes for increasing x - ray fluxes is a natural consequence of the changing injection rate of accelerated particles .",
    "the following alternative scenario ( `` scenario 2 '' ) seems attractive since it automatically accounts for the @xmath39kev x - ray spectrum with a spectral index @xmath40 , repeatedly observed with bepposax ( pian et al .  1998a , b ) .",
    "the basic difference to scenario 1 is a minimum energy @xmath41 of accelerated electrons which is responsible for the break of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "a large magnetic field leads to rapid cooling and hence steepening of initial electron spectra down to the minimum energy @xmath41 .",
    "below @xmath41 electrons which underwent cooling form a spectrum with the canonical spectral index @xmath42 , independent of the value @xmath43 of the initial spectrum .",
    "above @xmath41 the electron spectrum is characterized by a spectral index @xmath44 for @xmath45 . in this scenario one",
    "obtains naturally a synchrotron spectrum with @xmath46 from the electrons with energies below @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , the scenario allows for a high magnetic field which assures fast cooling ( relative to the flux variability time scale ) of the electrons near the peak of the sed and thus a high radiation efficiency .",
    "spectral changes in the x - ray energy range are caused in this scenario by the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath43 varying with time .",
    "we explored in detail a third scenario ( `` scenario 3 '' ) in which the observed characteristics are caused by a time - independent electron spectrum , but where all 3 parameters ( @xmath22,@xmath47 , and the density of emitting particles ) vary substantially . a changing magnetic field together with a rather stable",
    "( e.g.  due to cooling on small time scales ) electron spectrum could be the reason for large spectral changes in the x - ray band accompanied by a stable vhe spectrum .",
    "note , however , that it is necessary in this scenario to introduce fixed relationships between the parameters characterizing the emission volume ( i.e.   between @xmath47 and @xmath22 ) in order to explain the very tight x - ray / vhe correlation .",
    "further studies in this direction are underway .",
    "note that an alternative scenario in which the spectral variability as well as the x - ray and vhe intensity variations are caused by varying only the relativistic doppler factor @xmath48 of the emission volume can be excluded from the x - ray data alone . as a consequence of the lorentz invariance of @xmath49 a change of the energy at which the mkn 501 sed peaks by a factor of @xmath50 would be accompanied by a change of the observed flux by @xmath51 , where @xmath10 is the spectral index at the frequency of observations ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "we will summarize the constraints on the model parameters .",
    "the significant vhe @xmath0-ray variability on timescales @xmath52 of approximately half a day implies the well known upper limit on the radius of the emitting volume : @xmath53 given this limit , the doppler factor is constrained by the condition of a negligible or modest absorption of high energy photons in pair production processes with lower energy synchrotron photons inside the emission volume . extrapolating the synchrotron spectrum observed by bepposax at soft x - ray energies ( 1  kev ) according to @xmath11 with @xmath35 towards lower frequencies , we obtain ( see e.g.  svensson @xcite ) an optical depth as function of the photon energy @xmath54 ( frame of observer ) of the gamma - ray : @xmath55 here and in the following we assumed a hubble constant of 60  km  s@xmath56  mpc@xmath56 .",

    "this `` inversion '' of the synchrotron spectrum yields unique results for sufficiently smooth electron spectra .",
    "unfortunately , the predicted vhe spectrum depends partially on the electron spectrum outside the energy region constrained by the x - ray observations . given the observational evidence and the theoretical framework outlined above , we use the following probable assumptions about the synchrotron spectrum outside the energy region covered by the rxte observations , namely below 0.1  kev and above 25  kev .",
    "the rxte observations , as well as the osse observations from april 9th to april 15th , 1997 show spectra with spectral indices of 1.1 .",
    "we choose accordingly a spectrum of accelerated electrons with @xmath28 with @xmath80 .",

    "the synchrotron spectrum probably cuts off at some energy .",
    "the bepposax and the osse observations do not show any indications for such a cutoff up to energies of at least 150  kev .",
    "importantly , for the used values of @xmath79 and @xmath22 the location of this cut off does not influence the ssc prediction of the ic spectrum up to energies of 25  tev as long as the cut off does not influence the synchrotron spectrum below @xmath2150  kev ( compare eq .",

    "the predicted ic to synchrotron luminosity ratio depends on the assumed radius of the emission volume as 1/@xmath85 . assuming negligible intergalactic extinction at 500  gev we determine a radius of @xmath86 cm and @xmath87 cm for the april 7th and april 13th data , respectively .",
    "doppler factors below @xmath1715 result in too large radii which conflict with the upper limit from the flux variability time scale ( eq .  ( [ size ] ) ) .",

    ". the observed time - averaged mkn 501 spectrum shows additional steepening above 5  tev which is not found in the predicted spectrum .",
    "possibly , this additional steepening is caused by the intergalactic extinction .",

    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the appearance of the ic power law components can be understood by noting that the relative contribution to the production of ic photons from scatterings in the thomson regime and from scatterings in the kn regime does not depend on the energy of the responsible electrons as long as the seed photon and electron populations are described by power law spectra in the relevant energy ranges . as a consequence",

    "for an electron population with spectral index @xmath43 interacting with its own synchrotron radiation , i.e.  @xmath104 , one obtains the well known result @xmath105 namely that the ic spectrum has approximately the same spectral index @xmath106 as the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "a cooled electron spectrum with @xmath107 which interacts with the seed photon spectrum of the uncooled electrons with @xmath108 yields @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",

    "furthermore , in the scenarios discussed here , the narrow frequency range where the ic spectrum turns over ( @xmath113 ) is a region where we expect more rather than less spectral variability than below and above this frequency range .",
    "since ( i ) the rxte spectral index of april 13th approximately represents the mean value during the 1997 rxte observations of this source and ( ii ) the hegra vhe spectra did not vary during 1997 within statistical errors we think it is justified to compare the prediction of vhe spectrum of this day with the observed 1997 time averaged vhe spectrum .",
    "the predicted vhe spectrum mainly depends on the parameter @xmath114 determining the ratio of the ic sed peak frequency and the square root of the synchrotron sed peak frequency ( eq .",

    "larger magnetic field values ( more precisely , smaller values of @xmath114 ) are highly improbable since the resulting intrinsic vhe spectra are steeper than the observed ones in the energy range above @xmath21  tev .",
    "intergalactic extinction which decreases for increasing energy is rather unlikely given our present understanding and knowledge of the debra density .",

    "such measurements will become feasible with next generation cherenkov telescope systems as hess and veritas and with the satellite instrument glast .",
    "note that it turns out that in our ssc scenarios the energy density of electrons strongly dominates over the energy density of the magnetic field for all admitted values of @xmath22 and @xmath48 ( see also inoue & takahara @xcite ) .",

    "the result is consistent with a rather energy independent extinction up to energies of about 5  tev . from 5  tev to 20  tev the inferred optical depth increases by 1 to 2 units .",

    "we have analyzed a data sample of simultaneous and nearly simultaneous x - ray and vhe data .",
    "the x - ray and vhe observations were performed with typical time delays below 6  h. since x - ray and the vhe variability is found on time scales slower 1/2  day and the spectral indices change typically by less than 0.01 units per hour , the measurements are well suited for a meaningful correlation analysis .",
    "for the first time a data base with detailed spectral and temporal information in the x - ray and vhe bands is available which covers a considerable number of distinct flares with substantial flux increases and decreases .",
    "the strong variability signatures in both energy bands has been used to elucidate several key aspects of the emission activity .",
    "the 3 - 25  kev spectral index varied on a time scale of weeks from 0.7 to 1.1 , indicating that the peak of the x - ray sed shifted on this time scale from the energy region above 25  kev to below several kev and vice versa . in pian",
    "( @xcite ) a similar shift has been reported from observations taken in april 1997 and in may 1998 and was attributed to decline of the x - ray and vhe @xmath0-ray activity of the source from 1997 to 1998 .",
    "the observations presented here show that the shift actually occured also during the year of increased emission itself .",
    "furthermore , the time lag between the 3  kev and the 25  kev emission is constrained to be smaller than half a day .",
    "the data shows an excellent correlation of the x - ray fluxes at @xmath119kev with the 2  tev flux levels .",

    "it turns out that intrinsic source properties , namely a turnover in the electron spectrum , is expected to cause a turnover of the vhe spectrum just in the tev energy range .",
