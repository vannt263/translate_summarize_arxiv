    "recent spectroscopic surveys of the fornax and virgo galaxy clusters have revealed a new class of compact stellar system , `` ultra - compact dwarf galaxies '' ( ucds ) with properties intermediate between the larges globular clusters and the smallest dwarf galaxies .",
    "the defining properties of the first ucds found are that they are significantly more luminous than most known globular clusters ( @xmath0 ) , but they are mostly unresolved in ground - based sky survey images . in this paper",
    "we present detailed observations of a new sample of ucds in the virgo cluster in order to test hypotheses for the formation of these objects .    the fornax cluster ucd objects were discovered independently in studies of globular cluster systems around the central galaxy ngc  1399 ( minniti et al .  1998 ,",
    "hilker et al .",
    "1999 ) and in studies of compact dwarf galaxies in the cluster ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2000 , phillipps et al .",
    "2001 ) . confirmed ucds have subsequently been found in the virgo cluster ( haegan et al .",
    "2005 , jones et al .  2006 ) and ucd candidates identified in the more distant cluster abell  1689 ( mieske et al.2004 ) . at low luminosities ( @xmath4 ) the distinction between ucds and globular clusters is not clear ( see discussions in drinkwater et al.2004 , mieske et al .",
    "2006 ) , but in this paper we focus on the most luminous objects ( @xmath0 ) .    given their intermediate nature , most formation hypotheses for ucds relate them to either globular clusters or dwarf galaxies",
    ". they could be highly luminous intra - cluster globular clusters ( e.g.  mieske et al .",
    "alternatively , ucds may result from the tidal disruption of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies .",
    "this process can leave the nucleus intact on intra - cluster orbit ( bekki et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) as a ucd .",
    "other formation scenarios include ucds being the evolved products of massive super starclusters formed in galaxy mergers ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002 ) , or primordial objects ( phillipps et al.2001 ) .",
    "it is hard to provide definitive observational tests of these different scenarios for ucd formation .",
    "this is partly because the various scenarios do not always make very different predictions , but the observational picture also remains far from complete .",
    "the observational tests can broadly be divided into statistical population studies ( e.g.  the distribution of ucds compared to other objects ) and detailed studies of the internal properties ( e.g.  internal velocity dispersion ) of the ucds . in this paper",
    "we focus on the latter .",
    "our previous investigations have focused on the fornax cluster ucds .",
    "we used _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) imaging and eso very large telescope spectroscopy to compare the five original ucds to globular clusters and nucleated dwarf galaxies ( drinkwater et al .",
    "we concluded that ucds were distinct from known globular cluster populations as they followed a different relation between internal velocity dispersion and luminosity .",
    "the ucd properties were , however consistent with the threshing model in which the dwarf galaxy nuclei survived tidal disruption with no significant change to their luminosity or velocity dispersion .",
    "the tidal disruption hypothesis was also supported by haegan et al.(2005 ) in their analysis of 10 compact `` dwarf - globular transition objects '' found in hst images of virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "the transition objects of haegan et al . have slightly lower luminosities ( @xmath5 ) than the fornax ucds , but the brighter ones were found to be significantly different to globular clusters , both in size and in following galaxy scaling relations .",
    "haegan et al .",
    "suggest that `` bona fide '' ucds are also distinguished by the presence of dark matter as some of their objects have @xmath6 .    a detailed analysis of the stellar populations of compact objects in the fornax cluster ( mieske et al .",
    "2006 ) has reached quite different conclusions .",
    "they measured spectroscopic metallicities for 26 compact objects with luminosities spanning both ucds and globular clusters and found a break in the distribution at about @xmath7 .",
    "the more luminous objects have a narrow metallicity distribution with mean [ fe / h]@xmath8 , whereas the less luminous objects show a much broader range of metallicity and a significantly lower mean ( 0.56 dex lower ) .",
    "there is a break in the size - luminosity relation for these objects at the same luminosity .",
    "mieske et al .",
    "note that the metallicity of the dwarf galaxy nuclei in their sample is significantly lower than that of the ucds which , in turn , are better matched by models of massive young star clusters .",
    "they therefore suggest that the ucds in the fornax cluster are formed as a result of galaxy mergers , but note that the properties of the virgo cluster ucds are more consistent with the stripping model .",
    "in this paper we present new imaging and spectroscopic observations of the virgo cluster ucds listed by jones et al .",
    "these are analysed along with existing data for the luminous fornax cluster ucds ( drinkwater et al .",
    "in section  2 we describe the high - resolution spectroscopic observations , and in section  3 we describe the corresponding hst imaging .",
    "we present an overview of our results in section  4 by comparing the ucds with other objects in various projections of the fundamental plane . in section  5",
    "we investigate the ucd dynamics in more detail , calculating their mass - to - light ratios , and in section  6 we examine the ages and chemical composition of their stellar populations .",
    "our main results and conclusions are given in section  7 .",
    "we use distance moduli of 30.92 mag and 31.39 mag for the virgo and fornax clusters respectively ( freedman et al .",
    "observations of the six virgo ucds , a comparison m87 globular cluster ( strom417 ) , a comparison dwarf galaxy nucleus ( vcc417 ) and the ngc4486b galaxy ( its central part ) were carried out on 2003 april 67 with the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ) on the keck ii telescope in the echellette mode ( table  1 ) .",
    "a slit width of 075 was used , providing an instrumental resolution of @xmath9 50 km  s@xmath10 ( fwhm ) or @xmath11 6,000 .",
    "the wavelength range is @xmath12 , distributed over 10 echelle orders , with a dispersion of 11.4 km  s@xmath10  pixel@xmath10 .",
    "the exposure times are given in table  1 .",
    "in addition , standard stars of spectral types in the range between g8iii and m0iii ( table  2 ) were observed for use as templates for the radial velocity and velocity dispersion measurements and line index calibrators .",
    "the standard stars were observed in two ways : held centered in the slit , and also moving perpendicularly across the slit ( `` smeared '' ) to simulate the appearance of extended sources which overfill the slit and consequently have slightly lower spectral resolution .",
    "the seeing was a stable 08 the first night , and ranged from 08 to 11 the second .",
    "the first night was photometric ; the second had occasional light cirrus .",
    "the data were reduced using scripts in iraf and idl specifically written to handle the esi data format and idiosyncrasies , but otherwise are standard procedures for ccd data .",
    "spectra were extracted over a 15 aperture centered on the peak , taking in nearly all the light from the ucds and globulars .",
    "the relative flux scale was determined using nightly observations of feige  34 .",
    "the s / n for each integration ranges from @xmath13 to 25 per pixel , yielding final s /",
    "n of 30 to 50 after coadding the multiple observations of each target .",
    "the radial velocity and velocity dispersion of our objects were determined using two different techniques : the direct - fitting method ( as described and implemented by van der marel 1994 ) and the cross - correlation method ( tonry & davis 1979 , as implemented in rvsao / iraf ) . in the direct - fitting method the template star spectrum ( table  2 ) is broadened with gaussian functions of variable @xmath14 in velocity space .",
    "the resulting set of spectra are then compared with the object spectrum .",
    "the best - fitting gaussian function is determined by @xmath15 minimization in pixel space .",
    "the second method is to cross - correlate the object spectrum with the stellar template spectrum to determine the width of the cross - correlation peak and the redshift .",
    "the correlation width is used to estimate the velocity dispersion by comparison with results from artificially broadening the template stars by convolution with gaussian functions of known width .",
    "this method is less sensitive to the exact match between template and object spectra , than the direct - fitting method .",
    "velocities and velocity dispersions were obtained from the cat ( @xmath16 ) and mgb ( @xmath17 ) regions .",
    "the measured values are given in tables 3 & 4 and are consistent , within the measurement errors , for the two techniques and the two wavelength regions .",
    "the exception is vucd3 . in the following discussion ,",
    "we use values obtained as the mean of the two wavelength regions and the direct - fitting method as it gives smaller measurement errors . the adopted velocities and velocity dispersions for the observed objects",
    "are shown in table  5 .",
    "our measurements for ngc4486b are in good agreement with bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "there were almost no differences in velocity and velocity dispersion measurements obtained with smeared and unsmeared stellar templates .",
    "the two wavelength regions give significantly different velocity dispersions for vucd3 : @xmath9 49 km  s@xmath10 for the mgb region , but only @xmath9 38 km  s@xmath10 for the cat region .",
    "this discrepancy appears to be real .",
    "we suspect this may be because the ratio of giant to dwarf population contributions to the continuum is varying rapidly in this object compared to the other ucds .",
    "this might be expected because this object also has a much higher metallicity than the other ucds ( see section 6 below ) , so that the relative contribution of the higher gravity dwarf stars to the blue - green ( mgb ) region of the spectrum is greater , leading to broader lines in this region compared to the other ucds .",
    "the cat region is dominated by giant stars , no matter what the metallicity of the ucds .",
    "modeling of this effect could lead to a better understanding of the stellar populations , but a more extensive library of stars is required .",
    "we obtained images of the virgo ucds in the course of hst snapshot program 10137 .",
    "the data were taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , high resolution channel ( hrc ) through the f606w and f814w filters .",
    "exposure times were 870 sec in f606w and 1050 sec in f814w .",
    "the hrc scale is @xmath18 pixel@xmath10 . for the image analysis we used multidrizzle ( mdz ) files retrieved from the hst archive .    to measure the total magnitudes , we plotted curves of growth ( integrated magnitude versus circular aperture radius ) to find an aperture radius large enough to enclose all the light from an object .",
    "the instrumental f606w and f814w magnitudes were transformed into landolt @xmath19 and @xmath20 band following sirianni et al .",
    "the resulting @xmath19 magnitudes and @xmath21 colors are listed in table  6 .",
    "we have also used hst imaging data ( program 8685 ) for fornax ucds and a de , n ( fcc303 ) , initially presented in drinkwater et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , as one of the aims of this work is to compare virgo ucds with fornax ucds and dwarf nuclei .",
    "the data consist of 1960 sec exposures taken with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) in unfiltered mode ( 50ccd ) .",
    "the stis has a scale of @xmath22 pixel@xmath10 .",
    "we re - processed the stis images with multidrizzle to ensure that the data reduction method for the fornax ucd images was consistent with that of the virgo ucd images .",
    "the instrumental ab magnitudes were transformed into @xmath19 band using the relation @xmath23 ( h.ferguson , private communication ; see also gregg & minniti 1997 ) .",
    "we used @xmath24 colors for ucds and fcc303 from karick et al .",
    "the total @xmath19 magnitudes for fornax ucds and fcc303 are presented in table  7 .",
    "the images of virgo and fornax ucds were modeled using two - dimensional fitting algorithm galfit ( peng et al .",
    "2002 ) and assuming empirical king , sersic and nuker models for the luminosity profile .",
    "the king profile is characterized by the core radius , @xmath25 , and the tidal radius , @xmath26 , and has the following form : @xmath27^{\\alpha},\\ ] ] where i@xmath28 is the central surface brightness .",
    "we tried both the standard model with @xmath29 and generalized model with variable @xmath1 .",
    "the king model provides a good fit to globular cluster luminosity profiles when the concentration index @xmath30 and to elliptical galaxy luminosity profiles if @xmath31 ( mihalas & binney 1981 ) .",
    "the sersic power law is often used to fit luminosity profiles of galaxies and has the following form : @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the half - light ( effective ) radius , @xmath34 is surface brightness at the effective radius , n is the concentration parameter ( n=4 for de vaucouleurs profile and n=1 for exponential profile ) and k is a constant which depends on n.    the nuker law is as follows : @xmath35^{\\frac{\\gamma - \\beta}{\\alpha}}.\\ ] ] it is a double power law , where @xmath36 is the outer power law slope , @xmath37 is the inner slope , and @xmath1 controls the sharpness of the transition ( at the `` break '' radius @xmath38 ) from the inner to the outer region . @xmath39 .",
    "the nuker law was introduced by lauer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to fit galaxy centers .",
    "galfit convolves the analytic profile with the psf and determines the best - fitting model parameters by minimizing residuals between the model and original _ two - dimensional _ image .",
    "we derived artificial psfs for acs / hrc images in the f606w and f814w filters using the tinytim software and multidrizzle as follows .",
    "first we generated acs / hrc psfs with tinytim ; these include all the distortions , so they represent the psf in raw images .",
    "we then implanted these psfs in empty distorted images ( flt files ) , _ at the location of each target observed _ , and passed them through multidrizzle using the same parameters as were used for the data .",
    "this produces model psfs that are processed the same way as the real data . for the stis imaging ,",
    "the generation of the psf is more straight - forward and is achieved through a single pass of tinytim .",
    "the quality of the galfit model fits in the inner regions of each object is shown in figures 1 & 2 .",
    "these figures present residual maps after subtracting the ( psf - convolved ) model from each object .",
    "the quality of the models in the outer regions is better shown in figures 3 & 4 .",
    "for these figures we used the ellipse task in iraf to produce _ one - dimensional _ surface brightness profiles for the objects and ( psf - convolved ) galfit models .",
    "the @xmath40 values of the fits ( see peng et al .",
    "2002 ) are shown in tables 8 & 9 .",
    "we use @xmath40 values to choose the _ best model _ for each object ( see the last row of tables 8 & 9 ) .    from figures 1 - 4 and the @xmath40 values _ in both filters _ we can see that the _ virgo _ ucds are poorly fitted with the _ standard king model _ ( @xmath29 ) , but are very well fitted with the _ nuker law _  a double power law ( except vucd7 which requires a two - component model ) .",
    "king models predict a truncation radius , beyond which stars are stripped from the cluster by the galactic tidal field . _ none of the ucds show this tidal cutoff down to our limiting surface brightness .",
    "_ also , a main feature of king models is their central cores  the regions of constant surface brightness .",
    "we have found from nuker models that only one ucd has a flat core ( vucd5 ) , all other ucds have shallow or steep cusps in the center ( table  8) .",
    "_ generalized king models _",
    "( with a variable @xmath1 parameter ) provide better fits to the data than standard king models .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 controls both the slope of the profile , and the transition from the main body into @xmath26 .",
    "when we relax the @xmath1 parameter , we can better fit the extended outer parts of the ucds .",
    "however , king models have a tidal cutoff and do not fit the data as well as untruncated nuker models do .",
    "to fit a standard king model to the f606w data for vucd3 , we had to fix @xmath25 at 1 pixel ( 1.9 pc ) .",
    "there is no convergency if we leave @xmath25 as a free parameter ( perhaps because @xmath25 becomes too small , @xmath41 1 pixel ) .",
    "the lack of a good king fit to the f606w data for vucd3 is seen in figure  3 .",
    "we also failed to fit any of the king models to the f814w data for this object .",
    "there was no convergency with either @xmath25 fixed or relaxed .",
    "_ sersic models _ do not provide good fits to the virgo ucds either . in the majority of cases , the model profiles drop faster than the data .",
    "the fit seems good in the case of vucd3 , but this object has a very steep profile ( a very high index n ) . models with a sersic index n @xmath42 2 become very sensitive to the sky determination , flatfielding , the accuracy of the psf being used , and how well the assumed profile agrees with the data ( see on - line galfit manualcyp / work / galfit / tfaq.html ] ) .",
    "the more centrally concentrated a galaxy profile is ( the larger the sersic index n is ) , the more extended outer wing it has . because of this behavior ,",
    "if ( for example ) a profile already has a high intrinsic index n , a small underestimation of the background can make n even higher and can cause large errors in the magnitude and size .",
    "when fitting vucd3 data in the two passbands , we obtained quite different parameters : e.g.  the difference in @xmath43 was 39% .",
    "this could be due to the above reasons .",
    "we conclude that the nuker law appears to be the best model for all virgo ucds except vucd7 , in which case the king core + sersic halo model is the best one .",
    "the situation is different for the _ fornax ucds_. there is no universal model for them .",
    "two objects ( ucd3 and ucd5 ) are best fitted by two - component models .",
    "the other three have very steep profiles which are hard to model . in the case of ucd1",
    "the best model is sersic .",
    "the best model for ucd2 is the generalized king law and in the case of ucd4 it is the nuker law .",
    "the residual maps of fornax ucd3 reveal faint structure to the north - west of the core .",
    "this is very likely a background spiral galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "this structure affected the profile fits to ucd3 to the extent that the two - component models gave very inconsitent results .",
    "for this object we therefore restricted the model fits to the bottom half of the image .",
    "the model parameters for ucd3 in all the tables are from these fits to half the images , although we show the images and plots in figures  2 & 4 for the whole - image fits to reveal the background object .",
    "the ucd structural parameters obtained from the fits are summarized in tables 8 & 9 .",
    "the nuker fits gave us the outer power law slope @xmath36 , the inner slope @xmath37 , @xmath1 parameter , the `` break '' radius @xmath38 , the surface brightness of the profile at the `` break '' radius @xmath44 and ellipticity @xmath45 ( b / a is the minor - to - major axial ratio ) . from sersic models , we obtained the half - light radius @xmath33 , sersic index n , ellipticity @xmath46 and the integrated magnitude @xmath47 .",
    "the king fits gave us the core radius @xmath25 , tidal radius @xmath26 , concentration parameter @xmath48 , central surface brightness @xmath49 and ellipticity @xmath46 .",
    "all the galfit models assume a constant ellipticity which is fitted at the same time as the other parameters .",
    "the @xmath33 values and the integrated magnitudes for the king and nuker models were obtained via numerical integration of the luminosity profiles ( defined by formulae 1 and 3 ) .",
    "we also obtained half - light radii from the observational data directly ( @xmath50 ) . in this case the data were not psf - deconvolved and the half - light radii may be overestimated . the structural parameters for virgo ucds",
    "were averaged between the two filters .    for further analysis we had to decide what @xmath33 to choose for our objects .",
    "we could not take just the best model @xmath33 because , for example , in the case of virgo ucds the best model is nuker .",
    "for all the nuker models in tables 8 & 9 ( except for vucd1 & vucd5 ) the total volume under the profile ( the integrated luminosity ) converges very slowly .",
    "it makes @xmath33 estimations uncertain and results in unphysically large @xmath33 values .",
    "this is why we chose generalized king @xmath33 values .",
    "the generalized king models fit the virgo ucd data better than standard king and sersic models , and they are finite in extent .",
    "in addition to this , generalized king @xmath33 values are consistent with the observational half - light radii ( @xmath50 ) .    in the case of the fornax ucds we also chose the generalized king @xmath51 for one - component ucds and the king @xmath33 for the cores of the two - component objects .",
    "the sersic fits seem unreliable as all of the models have very high index",
    "n ( see above ) .",
    "nuker models are not good for @xmath33 estimation because of the reason explained above .",
    "we list the best values of the various parameters of the virgo and fornax objects in table  10 .",
    "these are used in the following section for analysis of the scaling relations . in table  10",
    "we quote three values of effective radius @xmath33 in the case of two - component objects ( vucd7 , ucd3 , ucd5 & fcc303 ) : the total , only the core , and only the halo .",
    "these were obtained via numerical integration of the model luminosity profiles .",
    "table  10 also contains the total v band apparent magnitude @xmath52 , the mean surface brightness within the effective radius @xmath53 and ellipticity @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath52 values are observational values copied from tables 6 & 7 except for the core and halo magnitudes of the two - component objects , which are model values taken from tables 8 & 9 ( king+sersic models ) .",
    "the @xmath53 values were derived from @xmath33 and @xmath52 as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath33 is measured in arcsec .",
    "the @xmath46 figures are the best model values from tables 8 & 9 .",
    "the ellipticities of the ucds given in table  10 show that some of the objects are significantly non - circular ; the maximum ( core ) ellipticity is 0.24 for fornax ucd5 .",
    "we have compared the distribution of ucd ellipticities with those reported for globular clusters in ngc  5128 ( harris et al .",
    "2002 ) and the milky way ( harris 1996 ; online catalogue version of 2003 february ) .",

    "we show that the ucds lie on the same tight correlation between mass and mass - to - light ratio as the bright gcs and transition objects of haegan et al . , but the fainter gcs ( @xmath69 ) show little if any correlation in this plane .",

    "the ngc5128 gcs also lie off the main gc relation between it and the ucds .",
    "we must note here that the ucds are from magnitude - limited samples ( equivalent to @xmath72 ) , so these data do not actually provide evidence for a gap between ucds and gcs .",

    "note that not many of these are expected to survive to such ages , but even those not disrupted would be unlikely to appear in the existing observational data sets due to the following selection effects .",
    "first , there are no ucds in this region as our ucd samples are limited to higher masses ( luminosities strictly speaking ) .",
    "secondly , gcs in this region would have high mass and presumably would only be found in external galaxies like the ngc5128 objects , but they would have much lower surface brightness values , so it would not be possible to measure their velocity dispersions even if they could be detected .",
    "it is interesting to note that the more massive objects ( @xmath74 ) show the opposite correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 to the lower - mass systems in figure  6 . since @xmath68 ( @xmath75 ) is increasing for the high - mass objects , it must be @xmath76 that is decreasing for these objects .",

    "we also show the parameters of the nuclei of a sample of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster ( geha et al .",

    "this is consistent with the threshing hypothesis for ucd formation from disrupted dwarf elliptical galaxies .",
    "the ucds are mostly well - separated from complete dwarf elliptical galaxies in the fundamental plane ; the closest galaxy to ucds is m32 , the prototype `` compact elliptical '' galaxy which is also thought to have formed through a disruptive process ( e.g. choi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "in this section we estimate the masses of the ucds using dynamical models .",
    "the masses and mass - to - light ratios of the ucds are important physical parameters for the understanding of their origin .",
    "in particular , the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath75 ) is an indicator for possibly existing dark matter and/or violation of dynamical equilibrium or isotropy of stellar orbits .",
    "if ucds were the counterparts of globular clusters , one would expect @xmath75 values as predicted by simple stellar population models ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 2003 , maraston 2005 ) .",
    "if ucds were of `` galaxian origin''formed in dark matter halos  they might still be dominated by dark matter and show high @xmath75 values .",
    "mass - to - light ratios larger than expected from simple stellar populations can , however , also be caused by objects that are out of dynamical equilibrium , e.g.  tidally disturbed stellar systems ( fellhauer & kroupa 2006 ) .",
    "the ucd masses were estimated from the measured velocity dispersions and their structural parameters .",
    "we showed in section  3 that the ucd light profiles can be fitted by various functions .",
    "a simple king profile often is not the best choice to represent ucd surface brightness profiles .",
    "however , most mass estimators available in the literature are based on the assumption of a king profile . in order to be not restricted to king profiles",
    ", we used a more general approach , using software developed by h. baumgardt ( see hilker et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the first stage is to deproject the observed density profile ( either king , generalized king , sersic , nuker , or king+sersic ) , calculate its distribution function @xmath77 under the assumption of spherical symmetry and an underlying isotropic velocity distribution , and finally create an @xmath78-body representation of the ucd .",
    "it is assumed that mass follows light ( e.g.  mass segregation is neglected ) . besides the projected profile parameters , the total mass of the stellar system and the number of test particles are needed .",
    "the resulting model is a list of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 positions and @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 velocities for all particles that correspond to the specified structural parameters and the given mass . from this model , the central as well as global projected velocity dispersion can be calculated .",
    "the projected half - mass radii for all the models were also derived and were in very good agreement with the half - light radius values in tables 8 & 9 .    in the second stage ,",
    "the velocity dispersion seen by an observer is simulated . in order to do this",
    ", all test particles are convolved with a gaussian whose full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) corresponds to the observed seeing .",
    "the fraction of the light ( gaussian ) falling into the slit at the projected distance of the observed object ( the size of the slit in arcsec and the distance to the object in mpc are input parameters ) is then calculated .",
    "these fractions are used as weighting factors for the velocities .",
    "the weighted velocities of all particles whose `` light '' falls into the slit region are then used to calculate the mimicked observed velocity dispersion @xmath85 .",
    "the total `` true '' mass of the modelled object , @xmath86 , that corresponds to the observed velocity dispersion , @xmath87 is not known a priori .",
    "one has to start with a first guess of the total mass , @xmath88 , from which the `` true '' mass can be calculated as @xmath89 .    in the case of the nuker and sersic functions",
    ", the models were truncated at large radii to avoid the unphysical infinite extensions of ucd light profiles .",
    "the truncation radius of the nuker model was fixed to 2 kpc .",
    "the truncation radius of the sersic model was set to 20 times the effective radius , thus ranging between a few hundred parsecs and a few kiloparsecs for the ucds in our sample .",
    "the true tidal radii of the ucds depend on their distances to the cluster center @xmath90 and the enclosed mass @xmath91 of the potential they are living in .",
    "they can be estimated by the formula : @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the circular velocity of the cluster potential and @xmath94 is the gravitational constant .",

    "( 2006 ) . in this paper",
    "the discussion will be focused on the virgo ucds .",
    "the uncertainties of the modelled masses were estimated from the uncertainty in the observed velocity dispersion , @xmath95 and the differences of the model parameters for surface brightness profiles in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 band .",
    "on one hand , maximum and minimum model masses were simulated that correspond to the observed velocity dispersion of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",

    "this suggests a difference in formation time , if not mechanism , for ucds in the two galaxy clusters .",
    "however , we prefer to refrain from any firm conclusions on fornax ucd origins until accurate age , metallicity and @xmath1-abundance estimates are obtained for them ; these should in turn be compared to the properties of _ fornax cluster _ globular clusters and dwarf galaxy nuclei . in the following discussion ,",
    "our conclusions focus mainly on the virgo ucds .",
    "the common feature in all the above results is that our detailed measurements of the internal ucd properties give values consistent with observed properties of globular clusters . in all the parameters we have investigated",

    "the ages , metallicities and abundances of the virgo ucds are similar to those found for gcs in the two brightest virgo galaxies ( m49 and m87 ) .",
    "this suggests that ucds and gcs could have the same formation epoch and the same star formation history .",
    "theoretical work shows that such massive objects as ucds could form in m87 and ncg  1399 and subsequently escape the host galaxy potential ( kravtsov & gnedin 2005 ; yahagi & bekki 2005 , bekki & yahagi 2006 ) .",
    "the surface brightness structure of the ucds is not different to that of globular clusters in the milky way and magellanic clouds .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios of the virgo ucds are consistent with simple stellar populations as in globular clusters .",
    "some of our results , notably the fundamental plane projections are consistent with the formation of ucds by the simple removal of the halo from the nuclei of nucleated dwarf galaxies",
    ". however the ages , metallicities and abundances for virgo ucds are not consistent with this simple stripping model",
    ". it might be consistent with more sophisticated models of the stripping process that include the effects of gas removal on the chemical evolution of the nuclei .",
    "as we have shown that the virgo ucds are old , we note that definitive tests of theories of their formation by stripping processes or the evolution of merger - formed massive star clusters will need to consider the effects of gas processes ( especially gas removal ) over these long timescales .",
