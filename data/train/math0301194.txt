    "complexity theory deals with the efficiency of answering mathematical questions about mathematical objects . in this context ,",
    "mathematical objects happen usually to posses a _",
    "unique _ encoding in a previously fixed data structure ( e.g. integers are encoded by their bit representation , polynomials by their coefficients , etc . ) .",
    "once a data structure is fixed , standard complexity theory searches for an efficient algorithm answering the mathematical questions under consideration and tries to certify the optimality of this algorithm .",
    "however , things become somewhat more complicated in the particular case of geometric elimination theory ( polynomial equation solving in algebraically or real closed fields ) .",
    "complexity theory for geometric elimination requires _ simultaneous _ optimization of data structures _ and _ algorithms . in order to illustrate this statement ,",
    "let us consider the following first order formula , say @xmath1 , belonging to the language of the elementary theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero : @xmath2 the formula @xmath1 contains two free variables , namely @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "moreover @xmath1 is logically equivalent to the following quantifier  free formula , which we denote by @xmath5 : @xmath6 if we choose as our data structure the standard dense or sparse encoding of polynomials by their coefficients , then @xmath1 has length @xmath7 , whereas the length of @xmath5 exceeds @xmath8 .",
    "however , if we encode polynomials by _ arithmetic circuits _ ( or straight  line programs ) , then @xmath1 and @xmath5 happen both to be of length @xmath7 , since the polynomial @xmath9 can be evaluated in @xmath10 steps , using iterated squaring .",
    "for the dense ( or sparse ) representation of polynomials _ superexponential _ ( sequential ) time is necessary ( and sufficient ) in order to eliminate a _",
    "quantifier block ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , whereas the elimination of an _ arbitrary _ number of quantifier blocks requires _ doubly exponential _ time in this data structure ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for lower and upper complexity bounds and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for upper complexity bounds only ) .",
    "the existing superexponential ( mostly grbner basis ) algorithms for the elimination of a single quantifier block are often asymptotically optimal for the dense and sparse encoding of polynomials .",
    "nevertheless their complexity makes them infeasible for real world sized problems ( however not so for impressive software demos ) .",
    "moreover , a simple minded grbner basis approach to the elimination of a single block of quantifiers may lead to a doubly exponential complexity .",
    "this situation suggests that these elimination algorithms require alternative data structures if one wishes to improve their complexity behaviour substantially .",
    "this observation led in the past to the idea of using arithmetic circuits for the representation of the polynomials occurring in the basic elimination procedures of algebraic and semialgebraic geometry ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for an early application of this idea ) .",
    "this change of data structure allowed in a first attempt to reduce the complexity of the elimination of a single block of quantifiers from superexponential to single exponential time ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however , the corresponding algorithms required the dense representation of the input polynomials and returned a circuit encoding of the output polynomials .",
    "therefore these algorithms were unadapted to successive elimination of several quantifier blocks ( see @xcite for more details ) and unable to profit from a possible special geometric feature of the input system .    in a second attempt ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", this problem could be settled by means of a new elimination procedure which transforms a given circuit representation of the input polynomials into a circuit representation of the output polynomials .",
    "the time complexity of this new procedure is roughly the circuit size of the input polynomials multiplied by a _",
    "function of a certain geometric invariant of the input system , called its _",
    "degree_. let us observe that the degree is always bounded by the bzout  number of the input system and happens often to be considerably smaller .    for worst case input systems ,",
    "the new algorithm becomes polynomial in the bzout  number of the system , and this was the first time that this complexity goal could be reached without hiding an exponential extra factor ( compare @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "afterwards the new algorithm and its data structure was extended and refined in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and in @xcite , @xcite it was adapted to the problem of polynomial equation solving over the _",
    "reals_. a successful implementation of the full algorithm ( @xcite ) is based on @xcite .",
    "a partial implementation of the algorithm ( including basic subroutines ) is described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "so far the account of successive improvements of data structures and algorithms for _ symbolic _ elimination .",
    "the complexity aspect of _ numeric _ elimination was treated in a series of papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the bit complexity aspect of the above mentioned symbolic and numeric algorithms was analyzed and compared .",
    "taking bit complexity and the bit representation of rational numbers into account , it turns out that a suitable numerical adaptation of the above mentioned new symbolic elimination algorithm has the best complexity performance between all known numerical elimination algorithms .",
    "therefore we shall limit our attention in this paper to _ symbolic _ elimination procedures .",
    "let us now briefly sketch the known lower bound results for the complexity of arithmetic circuit based procedures for the elimination of a single quantifier block .",
    "any such elimination algorithm which is _ geometrically robust _ in the sense of @xcite requires necessarily exponential time on infinitely many inputs .",
    "geometric robustness is a very mild condition that is satisfied by all known ( symbolic ) elimination procedures .",
    "moreover , suppose that there is given an algorithm for the elimination of a single quantifier block and suppose that this algorithm is in a suitable sense  universal \" , avoiding  unnecessary branchings \" and able to compute zariski closures of constructible sets and  parametric \" greatest common divisors of algebraic families of univariate polynomials .",
    "then necessarily this algorithm has to be robust and hence of non  polynomial time complexity @xcite .",
    "in particular , any  reasonable \" and  sufficiently general \" procedure for the elimination of a single quantifier block produces geometrically robust arithmetic circuit representations of suitable elimination polynomials and therefore outputs of non  polynomial size in worst case .    in this paper",
    "we are going to argue that the non  polynomial complexity character of the known symbolic geometric elimination procedures is not a special feature of a particular data structure ( like the dense , sparse or arithmetic circuit encoding of polynomials ) , but rather a consequence of the information encoded by the respective data structure ( see theorem [ theorem : section5.3 ] below ) .",
    "informally , we understand by a _",
    "data structure _ a class , say @xmath11 , of  simple \" mathematical objects which encode another class , say @xmath12 , of  complicated \" ones .",
    "an element @xmath13 which encodes a mathematical object @xmath14 is called a _",
    "code _ of @xmath12 .",
    "the data structure @xmath11 is supposed to be embedded in a context , where we may process its elements , in order to answer a certain catalogue of well defined _",
    "questions _ about the mathematical objects belonging to @xmath12 ( or about the object class @xmath12 itself ) .",
    "of course , the choice of the data structure @xmath11 depends strongly on the kind of potential questions we are going to ask and on the time we are willing to wait for the answers .",
    "the mathematical objects we are going to consider in this paper will always be polynomial functions or algebraic varieties and their codes will always belong to suitable affine ambient spaces .",
    "the _ size _ of a code is measured by the dimension of its ambient space .",
    "the ( optimal ) encoding of _ discrete _ ( e.g. finite ) sets of mathematical objects is a well known subject in theoretical computer science and the main theme of kolmogorov complexity theory ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this paper addresses the problem of optimal encoding of _ continuous _ classes of mathematical objects .",
    "the continuous case differs in many aspects from the discrete one and merits particular attention .",
    "any object class @xmath12 we are considering in this paper will possess a _",
    "natural topology _ and may be thought to be embedded in a ( huge ) affine or projective ambient space .",
    "the given topology of @xmath12 becomes always induced by the zariski ( or strong ) topology of its ambient space . in this paper , the _ closure _ @xmath15 of the object class @xmath12 in its ambient space will generally have a natural interpretation as a class of objects of the same nature as @xmath12 . in this sense",
    "we shall interpret a given element of @xmath16 as a _ limit _ ( or _ degenerate _ )",
    "object of @xmath12 .",
    "we shall always suppose that data structures , object classes and graphs of encodings form _ constructible _ subsets of their respective ambient spaces .",
    "if @xmath12 is for example a class of equidimensional closed subvarieties of fixed dimension and degree of a suitable projective space , then the topology and the ambient space of @xmath12 may be given by the chow coordinates of the objects of @xmath12 . or if @xmath12 is the class of polynomial functions of bounded arithmetic circuit complexity @xmath17 , then @xmath12 is contained in a finite dimensional linear subspace of the corresponding polynomial ring and has therefore a natural topology .",
    "the limit objects of @xmath12 are then those polynomials which have approximative complexity at most @xmath17 ( see @xcite , @xcite and section [ circuitcorrect ] for details ) .",
    "let be given a data structure @xmath11 encoding an object class @xmath12 . by assumption",
    ", @xmath11 is embedded in a suitable affine or projective ambient space from which @xmath11 inherits a natural topology .",
    "we shall always assume that @xmath11 encodes @xmath12 _ continuously _ or _ holomorphically _ ( see section [ holocont ] for precise , mathematical definitions ) .",
    "however , in order to capture the important case of the arithmetic circuit representation of polynomials , we shall not insist on the injectivity of the given encoding .",
    "more precisely , we say that @xmath18 encodes @xmath19 _ injectively _ or _ unambiguously _ if for any object @xmath14 the data structure @xmath11 contains a single element encoding @xmath20 ( otherwise we call the encoding _ ambiguous _ ) .",
    "a fundamental problem addressed in this paper is the following :    given an  efficient \" ( i.e. short ) data structure @xmath11 encoding the object class @xmath12 , how may we find another data structure @xmath21 encoding the object class @xmath15 ? how does the _ size _ of @xmath21 ( i.e. the size of its codes ) depend on the size of @xmath11 ?    in theorem [ theorem :",
    "encode1 ] , corollary [ encode3 ] , corollary [ coro : encode2 ] and in section [ section4real ] below we shall see that the solution of this problem depends strongly on the type of questions about the object class @xmath22 which the data structure @xmath21 allows to answer .",
    "this leads us to the subject of the questions we wish to be answered by a given data structure @xmath11 encoding a given object class @xmath12 .",
    "we shall always require that any element @xmath13 encoding an object @xmath14 contains enough information in order to distinguish @xmath20 from other elements of the object class @xmath12 .",
    "thus a typical question we wish to be answered by the data structure @xmath11 is the following :    let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be two elements of @xmath11 encoding two objects @xmath20 and @xmath25 of @xmath12 .",
    "are @xmath20 and @xmath25 identical ?",
    "in other words , we require to be able to deduce whether @xmath26 holds by means of processing the codes @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we call this problem the _ identity question _ associated to the data structure @xmath11 . a common way to solve this identity question consists of the transformation of the ( supposedly ambiguous ) data structure @xmath11 in a new one , which encodes the objects of @xmath12 injectively .",
    "another typical question arises in the following context :    suppose additionally that the object class @xmath12 consists of ( total ) functions which can be evaluated on a continuous ( or discrete ) domain @xmath27 .",
    "suppose furthermore that we have free access to any element of @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath20 be a given element of the object class @xmath12 and let @xmath13 be an arbitrary code of @xmath20 .",
    "the question we wish to be answered by the data structure @xmath11 about the object @xmath20 is the following :    for any given argument value @xmath28 , what is the function value @xmath29 ?",
    "in other words , we require to be able to compute the function value @xmath29 by means of processing the code @xmath23 and the argument value @xmath30 .",
    "we call this problem the _ value question _ associated to the data structure @xmath11 . of course , for a class @xmath12 of polynomial functions whose number of variables and degree was previously bounded , the value question for a continuous domain @xmath27 can be reduced by means of interpolation techniques to the value question for a discrete domain , namely to the task of determining , for any monomial @xmath31 and any polynomial function @xmath14 , the coefficient of @xmath31 in the polynomial @xmath20 .      in algebraic geometry ,",
    "polynomial equation systems are the  simple \" mathematical objects which encode the real objects of interest : algebraic varieties or schemes . except for the particular case of hypersurfaces",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ privileged _ canonical _ equation system that defines a given algebraic variety .",
    "it depends on the questions we are going to ask about the given variety , whether we shall feel the need to transform a given equation system into a new , better suited one for answering our questions .",
    "as far as possible , we wish just to modify the syntactical form of our equations , without changing their meaning , represented by the underlying variety or scheme .",
    "let us explain this in two different situations .",
    "very often the new equation system we are looking for is _ uniquely determined _ by the underlying variety or scheme and the syntactical requirements the new system has to satisfy .",
    "we meet this situation in the particular case of the ( reduced ) grbner basis of a given ideal ( representing a scheme ) for a previously fixed monomial order .",
    "the monomial order we shall choose depends on the kind of questions we are going to ask about the given scheme : we choose an ( e.g. lexicographical ) elimination order if we wish to  solve \" the given equation system ( i.e. uncouple its variables ) or we choose a graded order if we wish to compute the hilbert polynomial ( the dimension and the degree ) of the given ( projective ) scheme , etc . if we want to analyze a given scheme or variety by means of deformations , suitable ( i.e. flat ) equation systems , like grbner bases , are even mandatory ( @xcite ) .",
    "although grbner bases are able to answer all typical questions about the variety or scheme under consideration , they are not well suited for the less ambitious task of polynomial equation solving ( this constitutes the main elimination problem the paper is focusing on ) .",
    "since grbner bases are able to answer too many questions about the scheme or variety they define , they may become difficult to encode : a complete intersection ideal given by low degree binomial equations , may have a grbner basis of doubly exponential degree for a suitable elimination order , whereas it is possible to solve the corresponding elimination problem in singly exponential time using only polynomials of singly exponential degree ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider another case of this general situation :    for the particular task of polynomial equation solving it suffices to replace the original algebraic variety ( which is supposed to be equidimensional ) by a birationally equivalent hypersurface in a suitable ambient space .",
    "this hypersurface and its minimal equation may be produced by means of generic linear projections ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or by means of dual varieties ( see @xcite and the references cited there ) .",
    "the minimal equation encodes the necessary information about the dimension and degree of the original algebraic variety and about a suitable set of independent variables .",
    "however , as a consequence of bzout s theorem , the degree of the canonical output equation may increase exponentially with respect to the degree of the given input equations if we apply this strategy of elimination .",
    "we call an elimination procedure _ kronecker  like _ if in terms of suitable data structures , the procedure computes from the representation of equations of the given variety a representation of the minimal equation of the corresponding hypersurface ( see section [ section4.1 ] for more details ) .    in either case of this general situation",
    ", we need an _ input object _",
    "( a polynomial equation system describing an algebraic variety or scheme ) and an _ output object _ that describes the same variety or scheme ( or a birationally equivalent one ) and satisfies some additional syntactical requirements ( allowing e.g. the uncoupling of the variables of the original system ) .",
    "the corresponding elimination problem maps input objects to output objects . since",
    "an output object may have degree exponential in the degree of the corresponding input object we are led to ask about short encodings of high degree polynomials in few variables . in this context",
    "let us mention the main outcome of @xcite , namely the observation that using the arithmetic circuit representation , elimination polynomials ( i.e. the output objects of kronecker  like procedures ) have always size polynomial in their degree , whereas the size of their sparse ( or dense ) representation may become exponential in this quantity .",
    "but unfortunately , elimination polynomials may have exponential degrees .",
    "this inhibits the elimination procedure of @xcite and @xcite to become polynomial in the input length , at least in worst case .",
    "we consider therefore in more generality the following task :    _ let be given an elimination problem and a data structure @xmath11 encoding the input objects .",
    "find a data structure @xmath32 encoding the corresponding output objects and an elimination algorithm @xmath0 which maps input codes belonging to @xmath11 to output codes belonging to @xmath32 and solves the given elimination problem_.    in this terminology , the main problem this paper tries to solve can be formulated as follows :    _ is it possible to find in the given situation a data structure @xmath32 and a continuous algorithm @xmath0 ( in the sense specified in sections [ section2 ] and [ section4 ] ) such that the size of each output code belonging to @xmath32 is only polynomial in the size of the corresponding input code belonging to @xmath11 ?",
    "under which circumstances do such a data structure @xmath32 and such an algorithm @xmath0 exist and under which circumstances do they not ? _    as mentioned before , the solution of this problem depends strongly on the questions about the output objects we wish to be answered by the output data structure @xmath32 .    in view of the methodological progress made in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( leading to a substantial improvement of previously known complexity bounds ) and motivated by our interest in lower complexity bounds , we limit our attention to basic and relatively simple elimination problems of the following type :    * let be given a zero  dimensional algebraic variety @xmath33 by an input equation system in @xmath34 variables @xmath35 and let be given a supplementary input polynomial @xmath36 in these @xmath34 variables and possibly some additional parameters @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 and @xmath39 and let us suppose that the input equation system and @xmath36 have short encodings in a previously fixed input data structure @xmath11 .",
    "the problem is to find an output data structure @xmath32 and a kronecker  like elimination procedure @xmath0 such that @xmath0 associates to each input code of @xmath11 representing a specialization @xmath40 of the parameters @xmath41 of @xmath36 , an output code of @xmath32 representing the canonical elimination polynomial of @xmath42 with respect to the given variety @xmath33 ( see sections [ section4.1 ] and [ section4.2 ] for definitions and an example ) .",
    "* let be given a class @xmath12 of mathematical objects and a data structure @xmath11 encoding the object class @xmath12 .",

    "vermeidung von divisionen \" algorithm of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the limit objects are polynomials of degree at most @xmath44 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "another example of such a procedure is the transformation ( by means of  tensoring \" ) of approximative algorithms for matrix multiplication into exact ones @xcite .    in elimination theory",
    "one meets very natural non  closed input object classes with limit objects not encoded by the given input data structure .",
    "however , such a limit object may possess a well  defined output object . in this case",
    "one may require that the given output data structure is able to encode this output object .",
    "this is the typical context where a problem of type ( _ ii _ ) arises in elimination theory .",
    "another context , related to approximation and interpolation theory is the following :    let @xmath45 be a given encoding of an object class of @xmath46variate polynomial functions over @xmath47 having degree bounded by an a priori constant @xmath48 . consider @xmath12 as a metric space equipped with the corresponding ( strong ) topology .",
    "suppose that the encoding @xmath49 is holomorphic , allowing for each code @xmath50 and any argument @xmath51 the computation of the value @xmath52 using a fixed number of arithmetic operations in @xmath47 ( see section [ holocont ] for details ) .",
    "let @xmath53 be a limit object of @xmath12 , let @xmath54 be a sequence of codes of @xmath11 such that the sequence @xmath55 converges to the limit object @xmath20 and let @xmath51 be a given argument . as one easily sees , @xmath20 is again a @xmath46variate polynomial over @xmath47 of degree at most @xmath48 and therefore the value @xmath29 is well defined .",
    "moreover , the sequence of complex numbers @xmath56 converges to the value @xmath29 .",
    "however , the convergence rate of @xmath57 will typically depend on the argument @xmath30 .",
    "our goal is to compute the value @xmath29 using only a _ fixed _ number of arithmetic operations and limit processes in @xmath47 for sequences which do not depend on the argument @xmath30 .",
    "we reach this goal if we are able to solve in this context problem @xmath58 by a data structure which answers the value question .",
    "all known algorithms solving problem ( _ i _ ) or , limited to the context of classical elimination theory , problem ( _ ii _ ) , possess branching  free versions of the same order of complexity .",
    "we shall therefore consider only _ branching  free _",
    "algorithms for the solution of these two elimination problems . in this case",
    ", we shall always assume that our output codes depend _ holomorphically _ ( or at least continuously ) on our input codes ( see section [ models ] for details ) .",
    "an elimination algorithm is called _ universal _ if it solves for appropriate input and output data structures any standard elimination problem on arbitrary inputs consisting of boolean combinations of _ parameter dependent _ polynomial equations .",
    "a universal elimination algorithm is called _ branching  parsimonious _ if it avoids branchings for the solution of suitable instances of problems of type ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :    in section [ section2 ] we introduce the language and tools from algebraic geometry and algebraic complexity theory we are going to use in this paper . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we discuss different types of encodings of object classes : holomorphic , robust and continuous ones .",
    "we prove our first main result , namely theorem [ theorem : encode1 ] , saying that any holomorphic ( ambiguous ) encoding may be replaced by a continuous and unambiguous one of similar size .",
    "we retake the subject of this section in an appendix of this paper , namely in section [ appendix ] , generalizing theorem [ theorem : encode1 ] to corollary [ coro : encode2 ] and estimating the vc  dimension of a given , holomorphically encoded object class in terms of the size of its encoding .    in section [ section4real ]",
    "we introduce the main technique we are going to apply in this paper in order to prove lower bounds for robust encodings of specific object classes .",
    "we exemplify this technique by two fundamental examples .",
    "in section [ section4 ] we apply the tools developed in the preceding sections to elimination theory .",
    "we introduce the notion of a robust elimination procedure for flat families of zero  dimensional elimination problems and show that any robust elimination procedure requires necessarily exponential ( sequential ) time on infinitely many inputs ( theorem [ lemma : section4.2 ] ) . this result",
    "is then used in order to prove the second main result of this paper , namely theorem [ theorem : section5.3 ] , which may be paraphrased as follows :    suppose that there is given a universal , branching ",
    "parsimonious elimination procedure @xmath0 which is also able to solve in the context of elimination theory suitable problems of the above type ( _ ii _ ) .",
    "in particular , we suppose that the procedure @xmath0 is able to eliminate quantifiers in parametric existential first order formulas of the language of the elementary theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero and that @xmath0 is able to compute equations for the zariski closure of any given constructible set and the generically square  free parametric greatest common divisor of any given algebraic family of univariate polynomials ( see sections [ models ] , [ section5.2 ] and [ section5.3 ] for precise , mathematical definitions ) .",

    "we deduce now the estimate @xmath1293 .    since by assumption the sequential time complexity measure @xmath1188 is monotone , we conclude now that @xmath1294 holds for a suitable universal constant @xmath677",
    ".    therefore @xmath1188 can not be a polynomial function .",
    "finally we remark that the same conclusion is valid if we replace in our argumentation the formula @xmath1113 by the formula @xmath1114 .",
    "we may now summarize these considerations by the following general result :    [ theorem : section5.3 ] let @xmath0 be a universal elimination procedure for the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero with constants @xmath578 , @xmath1295 and let @xmath1188 a sequential time complexity measure for @xmath1296 .",

    "suppose that @xmath1296 and @xmath1188 satisfy conditions ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) above . then @xmath1188 is not a polynomial function .",
    "there exists a general opinion between computer scientists that proving lower complexity bounds for specific problems defined by existential prenex formulas ( see @xcite ) is an extremely difficult task which requires tricky methods or deep mathematical insight .",
    "simple minded algorithmic models and the absence of operative notions of uniformity make in our opinion excessively intricate or impossible to prove striking complexity results for many fundamental algorithmic problems of practical interest .",
    "a way out of this dilemma consists in the restriction of the computational model under consideration .",
    "thus one may for example think to consider only unbounded fan  in and fan  out arithmetic circuits of _ bounded depth _ for the computation of polynomials of interest , as e.g. the resultant of two generic univariate polynomials or more generally , the general solution of a flat family of zero  dimensional elimination problems .",
    "asymptotically optimal lower sequential time complexity bounds become then easy to prove . however",
    "the restriction to bounded depth circuits represents a highly artificial limitation of the computational model ( this restriction excludes for example the evaluation of monomials of high degree by means of iterated squaring ) and the complexity result obtained in this way becomes irrelevant as a guide for future software developers .",
    "the ultimate aim of this paper was not a theoretical but a practical one .",
    "we tried to give a partial answer to the following fundamental question :    what has to be changed in elimination theory in order to obtain practically efficient algorithms ?",
    "we established a list of implicit or explicit requirements satisfied by all known ( symbolic or seminumeric ) elimination algorithms .",
    "these requirements are : universality , no branchings and robustness for certain simple elimination problems , capacity of computing certain closures ( as e.g. equations for the zariski closure of a given constructible set or the greatest common divisor of two polynomials ) . moreover , by means of a suitable preparation of the input equation , all known universal elimination procedures may be transformed easily into kronecker  like procedures which are able to evaluate the corresponding canonical elimination polynomial in any given argument or to compute its coefficients . in this sense",
    "the known elimination procedures are all able to  compute canonical elimination polynomials \" .",
    "the fulfillment of these requirements and the capacity of computing canonical elimination polynomials implies the experimentally certified non ",
    "polynomial complexity character of these elimination procedures and explains their practical inefficiency .",
    "the results of this paper demonstrate that the complexity problem we focus on is not a question of optimization of algorithms and data structures .",
    "there is no way out of the dilemma by changing for example from dense to sparse elimination or to fewnomial theory .",
    "hybridization of symbolic and numeric algorithms leads us again back to the same complexity problems we started from .    in this sense",
    "the paper is devoted to the elaboration and discussion of a series of `` uniformity '' notions which restrict the ( mostly implicit ) computational models relevant for the present ( and probably also the future ) design of implementable elimination procedures in algebraic geometry .",
    "emphasis was put on the motivation of these algorithmic restrictions and not on the mathematical depth of the techniques used in this paper in order to prove lower complexity bounds .",
    "in fact , it turns out that elementary methods of classical algebraic geometry are sufficient to answer the complexity questions addressed in this paper .",
    "it is not the first time that a refined analysis of the complexity model produces not only elementary and simpler proofs of lower bound results in algebraic complexity theory , but also stronger complexity statements .",
    "examples are the `` elementarizations '' of strassen s degree method @xcite , due to schnhage @xcite and baur ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.5 ) , and the combinatorial method of aldaz and montaa for the certification of the hardness of univariate polynomials ( compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) with @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless there are two points addressed in this paper , which call for the development of deep new tools in mathematics and computer science : the problem of algorithmic modeling addressed in section [ section3.3 ] calls for the search of mathematical statements which generalize hilbert s irreducibility theorem to ( not necessarily unirational ) algebraic varieties containing `` many '' integer or rational points and to the characterization of unirational varieties ( in the sense of @xcite ) by means of arithmetic properties .    on the other hand our discussion of the notion of robustness of elimination procedures in section [ section4.1 ] leads to the question in which sense the concept of programmable function can be distinguished from the notion of elementarily recursive function ( here",
    "the concepts of specification and data type make the main difference ) .",
    "a programmable function appears always together with a certificate ( `` correctness proof '' ) that it meets its specification .",
    "the existence of such a proof necessarily restricts the syntactical form of the underlying program and hence the complexity model in which the running time of the program is measured .",
    "in this section we are going to formulate a slight generalization of the main results of section [ correct ] and [ circuitcorrect ] namely lemma [ ts ] , corollary [ corollary : tcs2 ] and theorem [ theorem : encode1 ] .",

    "<S> we investigate the _ intrinsic _ sequential time complexity of _ universal _ elimination procedures for _ arbitrary continuous _ data structures encoding input and output objects of elimination theory ( i.e. polynomial equation systems ) and admitting the representation of certain limit objects .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the following : let be given such a data structure and together with this data structure a universal elimination algorithm , say @xmath0 , solving arbitrary parametric polynomial equation systems . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the algorithm @xmath0 avoids `` unnecessary '' branchings and that @xmath0 admits the efficient computation of certain natural limit objects ( as e.g. the zariski closure of a given constructible algebraic set or the parametric greatest common divisor of two given algebraic families of univariate polynomials ) </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath0 can not be a polynomial time algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper contains different variants of this result and discusses their practical implications .    _ </S>",
