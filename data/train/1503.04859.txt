    "in the realm of adiabatic evolution  @xcite , the dynamics of a two - state system whose energies cross at some point plays an important role . the exactly solvable model of landau - zener - stueckelberg - majorana ( )",
    "@xcite is the most famous example of such class of problems .",
    "its widespread applications range from quantum optics and atomic physics to chemistry and biophysics .",
    "in fact , this model is of interest in several physical systems  @xcite , such as josephson junctions  @xcite , cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite and spinorial bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in order to better consider realistic situations , the implications of having a finite duration  @xcite or a nonlinear crossing  @xcite in the experiments",
    "have also been studied .",
    "generalizations of the original model to the cases wherein more than two states are involved have been considered @xcite , as well as level crossings occurring in systems described by nonlinear equations  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the  model in statistical physics , especially in connection with phase transitions in the ising model , has been discussed  @xcite . moreover , recently , a geometric landau - zener - stckelberg interferometer has been realized in single trapped ions by zhang _",
    "@xcite on the basis of a proposal by gasparinetti _",
    "et al _  @xcite , and landau - zener transitions in frozen pairs of rydberg atoms have been observed by saquet _",
    "et al _  @xcite .    in the original  model , the bare energy levels of a two - state system cross at some instant of time , but , due to the presence of a ( constant ) interaction , the degeneracy",
    "is removed in the adiabatic eigenenergies",
    ". then the adiabatic following of an instantaneous eigenstate of the hamiltonian leads to a perfect transition from one bare state to the other . beyond the perfect adiabaticity",
    ", the correction to the dynamics is given by the formula found by landau , zener , stckelberg and majorana which expresses the transition probability between the eigenstates ( non - adiabatic transitions ) of the hamiltonian  @xcite , and which is equal to the no - transition probability between the bare states .    in 1990",
    "et al _ have introduced a variant of the original  model where neither the bare energies nor the dressed ones really cross  @xcite , showing that , even in the presence of the same dressed energies , the circumstance that the bare energies do not cross as in the standard model determines significatively different results .",
    "one of the most interesting experimental realizations of this modified  model has been provided by bouwmeester _",
    "@xcite , who have observed such modified landau - zener dynamics ( they call the relevant mathematical description the hidden - crossing model ) in classical optical systems . by the way ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that with their experiment bouwmeester _",
    "et al _ have demonstrated that the validity of the model ( and related ones ) is not limited to the realm of quantum mechanics .    the variant of the  model complementary to the hidden - crossing model corresponds to a physical situation where both bare and dressed energies cross at the same time , which has never been studied .",
    "it is then of interest to analyze the adiabatic evolution of a two - state system in the special case where a real degeneracy occurs at the crossing of the bare energies . in other words ,",
    "we want to study the case where at the same time when the bare energies cross , the interaction , assumed non vanishing in the rest of the process , vanishes too . at this instant",
    "the adiabatic ( i.e. , dressed ) energies , just like the diabatic ( i.e. , bare ) energies , become degenerate . in this case",
    "the  formula is not applicable , and in order to estimate the transition probability we have to scrutinize the intricate behavior of the eigenenergies and the nonadiabatic coupling in the vicinity of this real crossing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the model hamiltonian we are going to analyze . in section  [ sec : adiabaticity ]",
    "we discuss the condition for the validity of the adiabatic approximation , firstly in general and secondly focusing on the instant of time when the level crossing occurs . in section",
    "[ sec : diabatic_transitions ] we report on an analysis that allows to predict the efficiency of population transfer on the basis of the peculiarities of the hamiltonian .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we summarize the results and provide some conclusive remarks .",
    "consider a two - state system whose dynamics is governed by a hamiltonian having the following form ( @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 this hamiltonian has eigenvalues @xmath2 and eigenstates    @xmath3    where    @xmath4    in the  model , the interaction is constant ( @xmath5 ) and the bare energies change linearly ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "if the change is very slow ( @xmath7 small enough ) then the evolution is adiabatic .",
    "moreover , when @xmath8 varies from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , the dressed states change from one bare state to the other ; for example , @xmath11 becomes @xmath12 ) . therefore",
    ", if the system is prepared in one of the bare states , and the system follows the corresponding dressed state , then in the end of the process each bare state is perfectly mapped to the other bare state : population inversion has occurred .",
    "perfect adiabatic evolution does not exist ( except for constant hamiltonian or for @xmath13 ) , and the  formula gives the deviation from perfect population inversion .    in the following , we will instead study the adiabatic evolution when @xmath14 and @xmath15 are such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 , when @xmath18 , so that a real level crossing occurs at the time instant @xmath19 .",
    "of course , there are several ways the two quantities can approach zero , and depending on this , the evolution of the system can be very different .    in order to maintain the possibility of having a complete population transfer , we will always assume that @xmath20 varies from @xmath9 ( i.e. , a huge negative value ) to @xmath10 ( a huge positive value ) or vice versa .",
    "indeed , this will make each of the dressed states change from being exactly ( i.e. , essentially ) equal to one bare state to being exactly ( i.e. , essentially ) equal to the other bare state along the experiment .",
    "after introducing the unitary operator describing the passage to the basis of the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian , @xmath21 we easily find that in this basis the evolution is generated by the following operator : @xmath22 it is worth noting that for @xmath23 one would seemingly have perfect adiabatic evolution ( in fact , each of the two instantaneous eigenstates would just acquire a phase , without undergoing any transitions ) .",
    "but , if @xmath23 then there is no change of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and then there is no real adiabatic evolution .",
    "in fact , the adiabatic following of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian governing the system is intrinsically the result of some approximations and obtaining an exact adiabatic following of the eigenstates of the system hamiltonian is a _",
    "chimera_. there is , seemingly , a violation to such an assertion given by the shortcuts to adiabaticity  @xcite .",
    "in fact , such techniques allow to realize the exact adiabatic following of the eigenstates of a given hamiltonian .",
    "but the crucial point of such shortcuts is that the exact following is obtained through an additional interaction , so that , in the end , the adiabatic evolution does not coincide with the adiabatic following of the eigenstates of the system hamiltonian . in other words , in order to realize the adiabatic following of the eigenstates of a given hamiltonian @xmath24 it is necessary to let the system evolve under the action of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a suitable additional term that allows to realize the shortcut and which does not commute with @xmath24 . in this way",
    ", there is no following of the eigenstates of the total hamiltonian of the system @xmath25 .      in order to have an adiabatic evolution the terms responsible for transitions between the eigenstates of the hamiltonian must be negligible , which in our case means : @xmath27 one finds : @xmath28 which can also be cast in the following form ( consider that @xmath29 and then @xmath30 ) : @xmath31    putting @xmath32 in this form , it is clear that a sufficient condition to guarantee an adiabatic evolution is @xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , in some cases , a finite or even a divergent value of @xmath34 can be compensated by the smallness of @xmath35 .",
    "let us come back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_condition_alpha ] ) and consider what the condition for adiabaticity becomes in the cases @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "first of all , consider that both for @xmath36 and @xmath37 one can say that latexmath:[$\\eta \\sim \\left|\\dot\\alpha / \\omega\\right| =    @xmath38 one has @xmath40 , for @xmath41 one has @xmath42 , while for @xmath43 it turns out @xmath44 , and then @xmath45 in both cases .",
    "this is just the case mentioned above where smallness of @xmath35 can compensate higher values of @xmath46 , and this is the reason why the condition for having an adiabatic evolution assumes a different form .",
    "it is of interest to give some general indication of the validity of the adiabatic approximation close to the level crossing . in order to develop such an analysis ,",
    "let us consider the behavior of @xmath47 and @xmath48 close to the level crossing occurring at @xmath19 , assuming that the leading terms in their taylor expansions versus @xmath8 at the crossing ( @xmath19 ) are    @xmath49    with @xmath50 .",
    "then , in the case @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , one has :    @xmath53    and to guarantee @xmath54 one needs @xmath55 . in the case",
    "@xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) it turns out , @xmath58    and to guarantee @xmath54 one needs @xmath59 . therefore ,",
    "each of the following inequalities guarantee adiabaticity in the very neighborhood of @xmath19 :    @xmath60    the last case to consider is given by the situation @xmath61 , which deserves a specific analysis since it requires the analysis of further terms in the taylor expansion of both @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in this section we give some general dynamical properties that allow to forecast the efficiency of the population transfer on the basis of an analysis of @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the level crossing .",
    "let us first of all assume that the evolution of the system is essentially adiabatic everywhere , with the only possible exception of the very neighborhood of @xmath19 .",
    "the total evolution operator ( that is , the evolution operator in the schrdinger picture ) can be written as : @xmath62 where we have introduced the adiabatic evolution operator : @xmath63 with @xmath64    now , since around @xmath19 the hamiltonian @xmath65 does not exhibit singularities ( far from this , it is infinitesimal ) , one has @xmath66 , and then : @xmath67 from which : @xmath68 where    @xmath69    now , consider what follows :    @xmath70    and , more important ,    [ eq : matreqs ] @xmath71    with @xmath72 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : matreqs ] ) we can derive the probabilities of the nonadiabatic transitions .",
    "the failure of adiabatic passage in the overall process can be quantified through the parameter @xmath73 :    @xmath74    the first of such two equations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : survprob ] ) , says that each of the two eigenstates of @xmath65 , @xmath75 or @xmath76 , follows the adiabatic change of the hamiltonian with probability @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand , eq .  ( [ eq : transprob ] )",
    "says that each of such two states undergoes a transition to the other state with probability @xmath78 .",
    "the nonadiabatic transitions are determined by the abrupt change of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian at @xmath19 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that , from the dynamical point of view , nothing really happens around @xmath19 , because the hamiltonian is essentially zero in that time interval .",
    "nevertheless , what happens from there on is mainly determined by the possible abrupt change of the hamiltonian eigenstates occurring at @xmath19 .",
    "the case @xmath79 can be obtained when @xmath80 , which implies @xmath81 . on the contrary ,",
    "the case @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) can be obtained when @xmath84 ( @xmath10 ) on the left of @xmath19 and @xmath85 ( @xmath9 ) on the right .",
    "therefore , we can say that when @xmath15 is infinitesimal of higher order than @xmath14 there is no abrupt change of the eigenstates and then there is a total transfer of population . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath14 is infinitesimal of higher order than @xmath15 we expect an abrupt change of the eigenstates and then a very low population transfer efficiency .",
    "when @xmath15 and @xmath14 are infinitesimals of the same order , a specific analysis of the behavior of @xmath86 is necessary .",
    "all these results have been derived under the assumption that the adiabatic approximation is valid everywhere far from @xmath19 , and that a possible critical behavior can occur only when the levels cross ( @xmath19 ) .    in the standard treatment of landau - zener - stueckelberg - majorana processes , @xmath14 is assumed to be constant and @xmath15 is considered as a linear function of time . in our examples , both for the sake of simplicity and to make it easier to compare our situations with the standard one , we have always assumed @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being a suitable parameter .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega_exp ] we show the population transfer efficiency ( i.e. , the final population of the initially unpopulated state ) when the @xmath14-pulse is essentially constant except for the neighborhood of the level crossing : @xmath87 .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 measures the size of the region where @xmath14 mainly varies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega_sin ] we consider a case where the shape of @xmath14 is far from being constant : @xmath89 , where @xmath90 represents the duration of the whole process , while @xmath91 determines the maximum values of the pulse . in both figs .",
    "[ fig : omega_exp ] and [ fig : omega_sin ] , a very good agreement between the results from the numerical analysis and the theoretical predictions ( @xmath77 ) is evident .",
    "figure  [ fig : omega_tsin ] compares numerical and analytical results for @xmath92 .",
    "we observe nearly zero population transfer efficiency , which is due to the fact that @xmath93 diverges at @xmath19 , assuming negative values for @xmath94 and positive values on the other side , which makes @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the numerical results and theoretical predictions have a very good agreement also this time . of course , in order to support the applicability of our theoretical analysis , we have always carefully checked ( through numerical evaluation of @xmath32 ) that the adiabatic approximation is valid essentially everywhere , with the only possible exception of @xmath19 and its vicinity .",
    "it can happen that the validity of the adiabatic approximation is broken before reaching the level crossing and for a while after it has occurred .",
    "in such a case , assuming that it is valid out of the ( small ) time interval @xmath97 $ ] , one can write : @xmath98    since @xmath99 is very small and assuming that @xmath65 does not exhibit singularities at any time , we can make the following ( rough ) approximation : @xmath100    if @xmath15 is an odd function , then one easily obtains : @xmath101 therefore , assuming adiabaticity everywhere out of the interval @xmath97 $ ] , the efficiency of the population transfer could be roughly given by : @xmath102\\\\ \\label{eq : eff_with_psi } & & \\qquad + \\sin^2\\xi \\ , \\sin^2[\\theta(\\tau)+\\theta(-\\tau)]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if the adiabaticity is broken far from the level crossing then all this treatment is not able to describe the behavior of the system .",
    "on the other hand , even under the proper hypotheses about adiabaticity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff_with_psi ] ) may give a wrong prediction because the first order approximation to evaluate @xmath103 can be insufficient .",
    "in this case , further terms of the relevant dyson expansion have to be used .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the dynamics of a two - state system whose energies undergo a level crossing .",
    "this is a kind of situation that can not be treated by the  model , because the interaction between the two states approaches zero when the bare energies cross .",
    "the theoretical analysis makes it possible to predict the transition probability from one bare state to the other on the basis of the way the bare energies and the intensity of the interaction between them approach zero at the same time . indeed , under the assumption that the adiabatic approximation is valid essentially everywhere except , possibly , around the crossing , the efficiency is mainly affected by the possible abrupt changes of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , if the bare energies cross faster than the interaction there is no abrupt change of the eigenstates and the population transfer efficiency tends to unity , while in the opposite case there is the most dramatic abrupt change of the eigenstates ( each eigenstate immediately after the crossing is orthogonal to the corresponding eigenstate just before the crossing ) and the efficiency tends to zero .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath14 approach zero as infinitesimal of the same order , then a specific analysis is required and the exact value of their ratio determines the efficiency of the population transfer .",
    "our theoretical analysis is supported by numerical calculations . we have always found a good agreement between the theoretically predicted efficiency and the corresponding numerical result , and in some cases this agreement is perfect .",
    "it is worth noting that in the very neighborhood of the level crossing nothing really happens , from the dynamical point of view , in the sense that the state of the quantum system essentially does not evolve ( being @xmath104 ) , but what happens at the level crossing significantly affects the dynamics from there on .",
    "this circumstance is typical of any sudden change of the hamiltonian , but in our case the peculiarity is that such a change is determined by infinitesimal quantities and the way they compare each other .",
    "somehow , it resembles a symmetry breaking , since the perfectly symmetric situation at the crossing ( @xmath105 ) is significantly altered , with important consequences on the system , by very small perturbations such as the pulses around @xmath19 .",
