    "the study of the dynamics of ionization process attracted significant attention last years , because laser sources allowing intense ultra - short pulses with the control over the fast optical waveform shape became available .",
    "such studies gained importance also because generation of shortest possible pulses is based heavily on high harmonic generation , which exploits the ionization dynamics .",
    "although the ionization process in most simple single - electron systems such as noble gases is studied for several decades , its details are still far from being fully clarified , thus being in a focus of recent studies @xcite .",
    "one of the most known peculiarities of the ionization process is its strongly nonlinear dependence on the input field strength",
    ". for high enough intensities ionization has predominantly a character of an instantaneous tunneling , whereas for lower intensities it is better described as rather slow multiphoton process .",
    "the boundary is not exact and was several time revisited @xcite , but , roughly speaking , it depends on the ratio of the ionization time @xmath0 and the optical oscillation period @xmath1 known as keldysh parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the ionization process above this threshold @xmath3 is nearly instantaneous and depends on the current field strength .",
    "this leads to an essentially step - wise dynamics of ionization rate , with steps localized near extrema of the electric field . on the other hand , below this threshold @xmath4",
    ", ionization depends more on the cycle - averaged field intensity rather than on the instantaneous field .",
    "it should be noted also that for multicolor fields the keldysh parameters can not be defined anymore in a universal way .",
    "creation of free electrons due to ionization leads to modification of the material s refractive index , thus making the later field - dependent and therefore introducing nonlinearity .",
    "the presence of nonlinearity leads to generation of harmonics of the pump field , which are sometimes called brunel harmonics @xcite .",
    "we remark that this mechanism does not requires return of the electron back to the core and therefore involves the harmonics of relatively low order ( in contrast to high harmonics generation ) .",
    "in particular , if the pump field is also asymmetric in time , this may create also a net macroscopic asymmetric current which persists after the pulse and thus gives rise to a low - frequency harmonic .",
    "this process is a type of plasma - induced rectification and leads to generation of frequencies in terahertz ( thz ) range @xcite , or the `` zero - order '' brunel harmonic .",
    "higher order harmonics are also generated , for both single- and multi - color fields , although with decreasing efficiency .",
    "brunel harmonics are to be distinguished from the ones appearing due to dynamics of the bounded electrons ( so called four - wave - mixing process ) . in general ,",
    "experimental differentiation between the two is a rather complicated task @xcite .    in this article",
    "we show that , looking from the perspective of the classical electron motion in the continuum , the brunel harmonics appear to be extremely sensitive to the subcycle step - wise character of the ionization process .",
    "if the ionization is `` fast enough '' ( tunnel ionization regime ) , it gives rise to the new harmonics whereas if the ionization `` slow '' ( multiphoton ionization regime ) , brunel harmonics do not appear .",
    "we show the transition between these two regimes for the pump pulses containing only one frequency .",
    "we also prove that this is the case for the thz harmonics in two - color case .",
    "furthermore , we show that the situation may change if the two - color field contains incommensurate harmonics , that is harmonics with the non - integer frequency ratio .",
    "such harmonics lead to beatings in the envelope which can be slow enough to switch on the brunel mechanism again , even if the ionization process is slow .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : el - traj ] we make a short introduction into the mechanism of brunel harmonics generation and describe the details of ionization process relevant to our consideration . in sec .",
    "[ sec : single - col ] we analyze the brunel harmonics in tunnel and multiphoton ionization regime in single - color pump whereas sec .  [ sec:2-col - comm ] and sec .",
    "[ sec:2-col - incomm ] are devoted to two - color pulses , with commensurate and incommensurate frequencies , respectively .",

    "brunel radiation can be described classically as a radiation created by a current of all free electrons . in particular , assuming a small volume of gas ( smaller than the considered wavelengths ) ionized in a pump field @xmath5 , the brunel radiation created by the free electron current @xmath6 in this volume will be : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a factor depending on the observation point . if delays in light propagation can be neglected but still the distance to the observer @xmath9 is large enough , is given as @xcite : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the volume of the plasma spot . in the current article",
    "we assume argon as a working gas .",
    "the expression for the current is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the electron charge , density of electrons and their average velocity , respectively .",
    "the change of current @xmath16 after time moment @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath18 .",
    "when calculating the change of average velocity @xmath19 , we take into account that the newly ionized electrons have zero average velocity , thus reducing @xmath20 : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electron mass . as a result",
    ", we get a remarkably simple expression @xmath23    the electron density @xmath14 is related to the ionization rate @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the density of non - ionized atoms before interaction with the pulse .",
    "ionization rate dynamics is important and is described below .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] one can see an exemplary process of free electron creation and their dynamics for single- and two - color pump field .",
    "we consider the electric field @xmath5 in the form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the phase which we allow to vary slowly in time , and @xmath29 are slowly varying field amplitudes and intensities which describe the corresponding pulse envelope , @xmath30 is the pulse duration , and @xmath31 is the relative phase .    in fig .",

    ", the electrons are ionized with highest probability close to the maxima of electric field and by subsequent acceleration move , in average , away from the origin .",
    "neither recollision no core potential were taken into account in our simulations .",
    "remarkably , the net current in the case of a two - color field in fig .  [ fig : trajectories](b ) possesses a spatial asymmetry , which is absent in the single - color case .",
    "therefore , the net current @xmath6 is also very different in both cases .",
    "already this simple example shows that the net current @xmath6 and thus the brunel radiation @xmath38 can be significantly modified by the field dynamics on the subcycle scale .    here",
    "we will show that the dynamics of ionization process itself can be also of critical importance for the macroscopic current buildup .",
    "as far as we know , there is no universally acceptable model which describes ionization dynamics for all intensities on all relevant timescales which is also valid for multicolor field .",
    "as it was mentioned before , for high intensities ( @xmath3 ) the ionization takes place on the subcycle scale . in this case , the ionization rate depending on the instantaneous field strength , describing tunneling process in quasi - static approximation , is acceptable for arbitrary pulse shapes and thus arbitrary number of frequencies in the pulse .",

    "now ionization does not depend on the instantaneous field but rather on the _ slow envelopes _ of the harmonics as well as on their phase @xmath31 .",
    "finally , for the case of a _ single - color _ field there is a relatively simple formula derived by ivanov and yudin @xcite , which correctly describes both cycle - averaged ionization rate and its slow and subcycle dynamics in both tunnel and multiphoton regimes .",

    "this formula is not applicable for multicolor fields , but for single - color ones it provides a possibility to inspect the transition between tunnel and multiphoton regime in details , which is done in the next section .",

    ", the bare ionization rate @xmath69 in the case of the weak field is many orders of magnitude lower than in the tunnel one .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics , thus the ionization rate as well as brunel radiation @xmath70 is renormalized to their maximum values in every case .",
    "the ionization rate in the tunnel regime demonstrates strong subcycle - scale dynamics whereas in the multiphoton regime it changes on much longer timescale of the slow field envelope .",
    "the brunel radiation @xmath70 looks not very different in the time domain , but significant difference can be observed in the frequency range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-col](c ) .",
    "namely , one can see that the brunel harmonics at the frequencies @xmath71 , @xmath72 indeed arise if the ionization is in the tunnel regime ( red lines ) and disappears if multiphoton ionization takes place ( blue lines ) . as it is shown in the next section , this is because the field of brunel harmonics appears as a convolution of the fast optical field with the electron density , and this convolution has no new harmonics if the @xmath14 changes slowly in time , as it is the case for the multiphoton regime . note that the harmonic at @xmath73 is related related to the free electron movement ( in contrast to electron birth ) and is not interesting for us in the present article .     of a single - color pulse with the parameters as in fig .",

    "such transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : par ] , where the energies of the 3th and 5th brunel harmonics are shown ( solid black and blue lines , respectively ) in dependence on the peak amplitude @xmath74 of the single - color field with the parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories](a ) .",
    "as the field amplitude decreases , the intensities of the brunel harmonics decrease rather dramatically .",
    "there are two effects in this , one is connected to the overall density of free electrons , which also decreases , the other is connected to the ionization dynamics on its own . to demonstrate clearly the later effect , we plotted the energies rescaled per single ionized atom ( technically , to obtain such quantities we rescale the ionization current @xmath75 and thus @xmath38 to @xmath76 ) .",
    "the resulting quantities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : par ] by dashed lines .",
    "if the brunel harmonic energies depended only on the number of ionized electrons and not on the corresponding ( subcycle ) ionization dynamics , such rescaled energies would not depend on @xmath77 .",
    "however , this is not the case.as one can see , they also decay quickly with decreasing @xmath77 ( although with much lower rate ) , demonstrating the importance of the fast tunnel ionization dynamics .",
    "this decay is also much faster for the 5th harmonics than for the 3th one , indicating strong nonlinearity of the process . as it will be shown in sec",
    ".  6 , the appearance of 3th and 5th harmonics would be impossible if the ionization rate were truly slow ( contains no harmonics at the pump frequency and higher ) .",
    "this shows also that the fast tunneling component in ionization dynamics is still present also for very low fields .",
    "now let us return to the case when the pump pulse consists of the fundamental frequency @xmath36 and its second harmonics @xmath50 , that is , eq .  ( [ eq:5afirst ] ) ,  eq .  ( [ eq:1 ] ) with @xmath78 , @xmath79 . in this case , both odd and even harmonics can appear .",
    "that is , brunel harmonics are located near frequencies @xmath71 with @xmath80 . in particular , a zero one , which is located typically in realistic setups at thz frequency , is of special importance because thz radiation is difficult to generate .",
    "the appearance of even harmonics is related to the asymmetry of the field as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories](b ) .",
    "for the two color case , as it was mentioned before , there is no general formula for ionization process allowing to track the transition from tunnel to multiphoton regime as we did this in fig .",
    "[ fig : par ] .",
    "nevertheless , we can consider these two cases separately , using tunnel ionization rate @xmath81 ( eq .  ( [ eq:11 ] ) ) for higher intensities and gac ionization rate @xmath53 for lower ones as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : el - traj ] .",
    "the corresponding figure for two - color case is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2-col ] .",
    "the parameters are the same as in the single - color case in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-col ] , but now @xmath78 , namely @xmath82 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories](b ) .",
    "in particular , we have taken @xmath83 which delivers the maximal energy for the thz harmonic @xcite .",
    "one can see that the same behavior is observed : in the tunnel ionization regime the brunel harmonics at @xmath71 are visible whereas in the multiphoton regime they disappear .",
    "this behavior is completely analogous to the single - color case and takes place because in the multiphoton regime ionization is `` too slow '' to create harmonics as discussed further in sec .  6 .",
    "let us now try two - color pump fields with incommensurate frequencies . by incommensurate frequencies we assume the ones with the ratio between them being not - integer .",
    "for this , we slightly detune the second harmonic @xmath50 to @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "that is , the electric field we consider is : @xmath86 the idea behind consideration of such field shape is the following : slight detuning @xmath87 leads in some slow beatings in the field amplitude , and in this case even `` slow '' ionization in multiphoton regime may `` see '' these beatings and thus generate some harmonics .        for the high intensity in the tunnel ionization regime we can still use the tunnel formula eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the gac formalism is valid for _ commensurate _ frequencies .",
    "however , we note that with the condition @xmath87 , we can interpret the frequency shift as additional relative phase which is slowly varying in time : @xmath88 and thus consider the field in the form eq .",

    "one can see the generation of new frequencies in the vicinity of the pump frequencies in the form of a comb - like pattern with spacing of roughly @xmath97 both in the case of tunnel and multiphoton ionization regimes .",
    "this is in contrast to the pump pulse which have peaks only at @xmath36 , @xmath98 . in the multiphoton regime , only few such frequencies is generated [ blue line in fig .",
