    "the kondo lattice model ( klm ) consists of conduction electrons magnetically coupled to a spin array through the kondo interaction .",
    "this model is ruled by two important parameters , namely the hopping strength @xmath2 of the conduction electrons , and the kondo coupling @xmath3 which can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "this model has been actively studied in the context of an antiferromagnetic kondo coupling .",
    "empirically , kondo lattices are described by a large and positive ratio @xmath4 , they resemble metals with very small fermi energies of the order of several degrees .",
    "it is widely believed that conduction and localized electrons in the kondo lattice hybridize at low - temperature to create a single narrow band .",
    "but understanding of this process remains vague and it is not clear whether the localized electrons contribute to the volume of the fermi sea .",
    "the available experimental data apparently support the fact that at low temperatures , this class of compounds behave as semiconductors with very small gaps@xcite . from another point of view",
    ", the compounds which show a small and positive ratio @xmath4 are generally described by a magnetic ground state , generated by conduction electron exchange or the so - called ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction@xcite . in that case ,",
    "rkky interactions induce an antiferromagnetic spin ordering transition at a temperature of order @xmath5 before the kondo effect has the opportunity to quench the local moment .",
    "finally , for more general and positive ratios @xmath4@xcite the competition between the rkky interaction and the kondo effect leads generally to heavy - fermion systems like @xmath6@xcite , which correspond to fermi liquid systems on the brink of magnetism .",
    "for some years , quantum effects in low - dimensional antiferromagnetic spin systems have also attracted theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "one such effect is the formation of a spin gap , which competes with antiferromagnetic long - range order instabilities .",
    "the origin of the spin gap in relation to the structural features has been extensively studied in a unified way for various systems .",
    "an example of such a system is the spin-1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain which behaves quite differently from a spin-1/2 chain and which exhibits the so - called haldane gap@xcite .",
    "the ground state of the spin-1 chain , with an open boundary condition has a novel string - topological order@xcite and resembles a valence bond solid ( vbs ) state@xcite .",
    "a typical s=1 quasi one - dimensional antiferromagnet @xmath7 ( nenp ) exhibits spin gap behavior@xcite and provides experimental evidence to support the existence of a vbs state . in this material",

    "another compound which shows spin - gap behavior is the 2-leg spin - ladder system , @xmath8@xcite .",

    ", we will show that the so - called ferromagnetic 2-leg spin ladder and the s=1 antiferromagnet systems occur as new interesting kondo insulators .",
    "then , we will investigate the effects of very weak exterior perturbations , in these two similar kondo insulators .",
    "more precisely , by applying standard bosonization methods@xcite and renormalization group methods , we will prove that a substantial change occurs in the bulk spin state of the 2-leg spin ladder kondo insulator by the introduction of few holes , and also by the application of quenched disorder .",
    "in the strong coupling regime , the problem lacks a small parameter and can not be analyzed by perturbation theory .",
    "but , we will give some indisputable qualitative and topological arguments to check that in that case , the haldane phase is rather stable against the same weak exterior perturbations . + finally , we introduce a weak - coupling `` analogue '' of the s=1 antiferromagnet kondo insulator , and we will prove that the transition into the anderson localization state@xcite may be suppressed in that unusual weak - coupling haldane system .",

    "since the two spin bosons @xmath64 and @xmath65 turn out to be very similar to the ones usually discussed for two spin chains , this variety of kondo insulator is assumed to be very similar to a 2-leg spin ladder system ; it can be viewed as a spin system , defined by a spin operator which is larger than a s=1/2 spin but smaller than a s=1 spin .",

    "+ at long distance , the matrices f and g are traceless ; from topological and kinetic points of view , the spin problem becomes equivalent to the problem of two coupled `` identical '' spin chains . in that sense",

    "finally , a coupling like @xmath82 is not relevant at long distance either .",
    "then , since the topological charge is defined `` modulo 2 '' , the hamiltonian @xmath83 behaves as a system without any topological charge and this indisputable fact rules all the low - energy physics .",
    "+ first , the dynamical coupling @xmath84 is now asymptotically free and by using the well - known `` background method '' @xcite , we obtain : @xmath85 by the use of the relevant cut - off @xmath86 for the spin excitations , it comes that the ground state is _ confined _ inside the small characteristic length : @xmath87 second , site parity @xmath88 is not broken and as a consequence , the ground state is non - degenerate .",
    "we remember that site parity acts on f simply as : @xmath89 third , spin-1/2 excitations can not occur .",
    "definitively , we obtain the same short - range rvb state which does not possess any free spinon , than in the purely two - leg spin ladder problem .",
    "finally , lowest - energy spin excitations ( well - modelled by the instantonic term @xmath90 ) are composed of singlet - triplet excitations ; they occur by the `` spin - flip '' of a spinon , and generate magnetism characterized by spin - spin correlation functions decreasing exponentially . at higher energy ,",
    "singlet - singlet excitations may occur due to the spin flip of two spinons ; they bring corrections to spin - spin correlation functions .      even for a very small hole - doping ,",
    "the @xmath55 oscillation is not commensurate with the alternating localized spin operator , and the term @xmath56 can be dropped out .",
    "the system behaves as a metallic state , and it is not well - described by any rvb state since the spin gap is destroyed by the commensurate - incommensurate transition .",
    "inevitably , a substantial change occurs in the bulk spin state of the 2-leg spin ladder kondo insulator , by doping with few holes .",
    "now , it is necessary to properly re - define the ground state and the low - energy spin excitations in that situation .",
    "+ the nearest neighbour @xmath20-coupling favors @xmath0 excitations in the spin chain .",
    "the rkky interaction , characterized by the energy scale @xmath91 , has also to be taken into account ; indeed , the energy scale @xmath92 is more relevant than the mass gap m. it implies that the term @xmath51 is not submitted to renormalization effects , and the rkky interaction may control the short - range distance behavior either , making a characteristic structure around @xmath1 in correlation functions . in the present case ,",
    "the form factor of the @xmath21-spin correlation function may exhibit two structures in momentum space at @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "then , by using general results on the tl liquid and on the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic chain , the precise power - law for the spin - spin correlation functions are given : @xmath93 we have omitted less relevant contributions .",
    "the term @xmath94 comes from the magnetic polarization by the 1d electron gas ; it corresponds to the usual spin - spin correlation functions in the 1d electron gas .",
    "the term @xmath95 is generated by the direct exchange @xmath20 . in the model , @xmath96 is assumed to be much larger than @xmath5 ; hence , we deduce that @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath0 structure is expected to be more prominent than the @xmath98 one .",
    "for a small hole - doping , the incommensurate rkky interaction enhances the antiferromagnetism generated by the heisenberg exchange but , at quarter filling it would favor a ferromagnetic exchange between localized spins which tend to compete with it . in the limit @xmath99 , the antiferromagnetism wins and the @xmath1 spin excitations are assumed to vanish . + it is interesting to remark that , as in the impurity - doped haldane system @xmath10 , the disappearance of the haldane phase enhances much the antiferromagnetic spin - spin correlation functions in that case .",
    "+ finally , we also insist on the fact that the 1d electron gas is weakly affected by the rkky process .",
    "more precisely , if we keep only the terms which contain the spinon field @xmath64 ( in the hamiltonian ) , we obtain an hamiltonian of the form : @xmath100 now , the precise spinon field writes : @xmath101 and : @xmath102 in the limit @xmath103 , the angle @xmath104 is very small .",
    "it proves that the spin array does not manage to quench the 1d electron gas , in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "accordingly , the single notable effect producing in the 1d electron gas is that the velocity of the free spinons @xmath105 is increased to @xmath106 due to the rkky process ; it is increased due to the magnetic diffusion by the spin array .",
    "finally , since no charge fluctuation is authorized in the spin array , the charge sector of the 1d electron gas is not affected ; it is always ruled by the boson field @xmath27 .        when @xmath107 , the ope used to obtain eqs.([uu ] ) and ( [ p ] ) breaks down in this limit , and therefore the problem can not be analyzed in perturbation theory .",
    "however , since the two spin bosons @xmath108 and @xmath109 turn out to be very similar to the ones usually discussed for two spin chains , the ground state is expected to be very similar to a pure s=1 antiferromagnet system . instead , a variety of approximate methods have been suggested to study the s=1 antiferromagnetic spin chain@xcite .",
    "but , it is not our purpose to review them here .",
    "we give some topological arguments to confirm that the so - called valence bond solid ( vbs ) state corresponds to the ground state of the 1d klm in that strong coupling regime .",
    "we remember that , in the vbs state each spin-1 is composed of two symmetrized spin-1/2 objects , and the spin-1/2 objects form singlets with the spin-1/2 objects on neighboring sites , resembling rather the ground state of a dimerized spin-1/2 chain . + here , the su(2 )",
    "spin symmetry of the electronic spin operator is explicitly broken onto @xmath110 , and the @xmath111 symmetry which corresponds to @xmath112 is spontaneously broken due to the influence of the term @xmath51 .",
    "we expect : @xmath113 first , we may conclude that the above short - range rvb description is certainly not available in that case ; `` interchain '' singlet valence bonds could not occur , and it proves that the term @xmath56 becomes meaningless in the strong coupling limit .",
    "second , as in the strong antiferromagnetic kondo coupling limit , the strong ferromagnetic kondo coupling tends to quench the 1d electron gas .",
    "unlike the weak - coupling regime , we expect a large charge gap which varies like @xmath114 ; obviously , the umklapp process does not change anything about this conclusion .",
    "+ finally , in contrast to the previous case , the low - energy physics can not be described by spin-1 objects .",
    "indeed , in that case , the ground state is still submitted to the fact that we couple two level-1 @xmath115 wzw theories in the spin sector@xcite .",
    "it means that the asymptotic behavior of the spin-1 system is also ruled by an hamiltonian of type @xmath83 ; the relevant topological charge is @xmath75 and the dynamical coupling is @xmath116 .",
    "we deduce that , the ground state of the s=1 antiferromagnet kondo insulator , is also non - degenerate and especially it is also described by a sea of singlet valence bonds . of course , since `` interchain '' valence bonds could not occur in the strong coupling limit , the latter are now formed separately in the tl liquid and in the spin array .",
    "it produces a non - zero haldane gap in the excitation spectrum but in that case , it is of the same order of magnitude @xmath48 .",
    "we also remember that in the weak - coupling limit , we have fixed the large velocity @xmath117 of the free spinons to 1 ; in the strong coupling regime , the 1d electron gas is rather trapped by the spin array , and it leads to impose @xmath118 . with the used formalism ,",
    "it consists to renormalize , @xmath119 with @xmath120 ; the dynamical parameter @xmath121 is free at high energy , and eq.([r ] ) is not correct : the ground state has no finite characteristic length , and @xmath122 .",
    "definitively , we conclude that the ground state resembles a vbs state .",
    "away from half - filling , localization remains in the transport properties due to the large charge gap of order @xmath114 imposed by the term @xmath51 , and the weak - coupling treatment obviously breaks down ( it would correspond to @xmath123 ) . here",
    ", since the massless charge excitations are considerably reduced by the magnetic interaction with the spin array , we argue that the ground state of a hole - doped s=1 antiferromagnet kondo insulator is very similar to the ground state of an impurity - doped s=1 antiferromagnet .",
    "thus , we can use some results concerning the effects of non - magnetic impurities driven on a s=1 antiferromagnet , to investigate hole - doping effects on the s=1 antiferromagnet kondo insulator .",
    "+ in the case of a very small hole doping , by using ref.@xcite , we conclude that the haldane phase and its topological structure should be quite stable against weak - bond randomness .",
    "low - energy excited states below the spin gap may appear upon hole - doping due to the presence of few free spinons , but the haldane gap is not `` filled '' in the context of weak - bond randomness .",
    "+ for larger doping regions , the haldane state can not survive anymore ; it can not fight against an important number of free spinons .",
    "the topological features become obviously badly defined because the spin system shows now a large number of residual s=1/2-spins .",
    "it is very difficult to investigate theoretically such a spin system ; we may treat only the other limit of a very small electronic density of state . in that context , the resulting spin system consists of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet where some rare s=1 impurities are included . from a topological point of view , the presence of a single s=1 magnetic impurity disturbs locally the spin-1/2 chain .",
    "accordingly , we expect to flow to the open spin-1/2 chain fixed point@xcite .",
    "more precisely , to stabilize the system , the s=1 magnetic impurity tends to couple antiferromagnetically to the next pair of spins in the chain ( via the kondo effect ) and consequently , the antiferromagnetic couplings to the screening spins give a purely s=0 singlet which cuts the chain .",
    "+ finally , due to the narrow link between charge and spin excitations in the 1d klm , we have proved that in contrast to the weak - coupling limit , the haldane phase which describes the strong coupling regime is still stable against a very small hole - doping .",
    "it is due to the important fact , that massless charge excitations are considerably suppressed by the strong kondo coupling ; charge excitations are not prominent , that allows to still stabilize the vbs state in the presence of few holes . to summarize , a schematic phase - diagram of the ( pure ) 1d klm , in the case of a ferromagnetic kondo coupling",
    "is proposed in figure . 1 .",
    "now , since the 1d klm couples charge and spin degrees of freedom , it is relevant to investigate randomness effects on these two similar kondo insulators .",
    "first , the s=1 antiferromagnet kondo insulator should not be really affected by the presence of defects since it opens a large charge gap of order @xmath114 .",
    "the 1d electron gas is quenched by the spin array and backward scatterings due to impurities appear irrelevant .",
    "second , we do not know randomness effects in the two - leg spin ladder kondo insulator . to investigate precisely this point ,",
    "it is necessary to switch over to abelian bosonization notation .",

    "but , although in this case we do not know precisely the fixed point , it is expected that sufficiently strong disorder may destroy the tl liquid state and bring about the transition into the anderson localization state .",
    "now , we give physical arguments about this conclusion .",
    "+ in the pure system , the presence of the haldane gap reduces the number of massless excitations .",
    "in fact , the ferromagnetic kondo coupling induces ( magnetic ) backward scatterings due to the spin array of the form : @xmath152 it develops a relevant `` @xmath153 '' charge - density wave ( cdw ) .",

    "definitively , the charge fixed point is the same than for repulsive interaction in the 1d hubbard model@xcite ; the anderson localization by disorder inevitably takes place in this weak - coupling kondo system . since `` @xmath153 '' charge and spin excitations",

    "indeed , reduce the s=1 spin excitations occurring in the 2-leg spin ladder kondo insulator to the doublet @xmath160 , increases considerably the charge gap of the 1d electron gas , imposed by the spin array .",
    "the 1d electron gas becomes more attractive by the spin array than by impurities , that allows to suppress the influence of backward scatterings due to impurities , in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "although our discussions here for the anderson localization rely on weak - coupling renormalization - group methods , we think that the qualitative features should not be changed even if we take into account higher order correction in @xmath175 and @xmath136 .",
    "finally , results concerning disorder effects in the weak - coupling limit , are summarized in the schematic phase - diagram proposed in figure .",
    "summarizing , the 2-leg spin ladder and the s=1 antiferromagnet occur as new interesting kondo insulators ; both are described by a valence bond state and massive singlet - triplet excitations . in this paper , it has been proved for the first time that they respond differently to a very small hole doping or quenched disorder , in the 1d klm .",
    "+ in the strong coupling limit , a narrow equivalence occurs between the breaking of the discrete spin symmetry ( @xmath112 ) and the pinning of the 1d electron gas by the spin array .",
    "it allows the haldane state to be quite stable against a very small hole - doping , although low - energy excited sates below the spin gap may occur due to the presence of the rare free spinons , and either against the presence of defects in the system .",
    "+ conversely , we have shown precisely that a substantial change occurs in the bulk spin state of the 2-leg spin ladder kondo insulator in the presence of few holes , and also in the presence of defects .",
    "first , in the presence of few holes , the charge sector becomes inevitably massless in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the tl liquid is now governed by free spinons , and the haldane state is immediately destroyed . that produces an antiferromagnetic ground state , characterized by a form factor of the spin - spin correlation functions which exhibits two structures respectively at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "second , in the presence of quenched randomness , the transition into the anderson - localization state inevitably takes place .",
    "indeed , in the pure system , the ferromagnetic kondo coupling opens a small charge gap of order the haldane gap ; that does not allow to suppress the influence of backward scatterings due to the defects . + finally , a weak - coupling `` analogue '' of the s=1 antiferromagnet kondo insulator has been proposed . in that unusual weak - coupling system , due to the reduction of the massive s=1 spin excitations to the doublet @xmath160 ,",
    "the charge gap imposed by the spin array becomes much larger than the spin gap .",
    "accordingly , it has been proved precisely that the transition into the anderson - localization state is suppressed in that system , in presence of randomness ; the 1d electron gas becomes more attractive by the spin array than by the defects . from this point of view , the haldane state prevents impurity potential from pinning the cdw .",
    "+ remarkably , in the weak - coupling regime , suppress planar spin excitations tends also to suppress massless charge excitations ; we conclude that as in the strong coupling limit , the anderson - localization by disorder becomes replaced by a magnetic localization by the spin array .",
