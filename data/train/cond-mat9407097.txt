    "the unusual properties of high - temperature superconductors have led to great interest in the physics of correlated electrons near a mott - hubbard metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "thereby a particularly intriguing problem is the volume of the fermi surface ( fs ) for the slightly less than half - filled band : should one model the doped insulator by a dilute gas of quasiparticles corresponding to the doped holes ( this would imply that the volume of the fs is proportional to the hole concentration ) or do all electrons take part in the formation of the fermi surface , so that its volume is identical to that of free electrons ? it is the purpose of this paper to present evidence that for finite clusters of @xmath3@xmath8@xmath5 model the first picture is the correct one : the fs as deduced from the momentum distribution takes the form of small hole pockets .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath8@xmath5 model reads : @xmath9.\\ ] ] the @xmath10 are the electronic spin operators , @xmath11 and the sum over @xmath12 stands for a summation over all pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "various authors@xcite have computed the momentum distribution @xmath13@xmath14@xmath15 for the two - hole ground state of small clusters of this model ( corresponding to a nominal hole concentration of @xmath16@xmath17% ) and found it roughly consistent with a free - electron picture : @xmath0 is maximum at @xmath18@xmath14@xmath19 , minimum at @xmath18@xmath14@xmath20 .",
    "it has become customary@xcite to cite this as evidence that already at such fairly low hole concentrations the @xmath3@xmath8@xmath5 model has a free electron - like ( ` large ' ) fs .",
    "it is straightforward to see , however , that this shape of @xmath0 is simply the consequence of elementary sum - rules and has no significance for the actual topology of the fs@xcite .",
    "we have therefore performed a systematic study of the @xmath0 for various doping levels and @xmath2 .",
    "as compared to the uniform value of @xmath21 for the half - filled case , the introduction of only a single hole changes @xmath22 in a rather complex way .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows @xmath0 for the single hole - ground states with momentum @xmath23 in the @xmath24-site cluster and momentum @xmath25 in the @xmath26-site cluster .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath0 is roughly consistent with free electrons , i.e. @xmath0 is large near @xmath19 and small near @xmath27 .",
    "this structure , which simply ensures negative kinetic energy@xcite , is less pronounced the smaller @xmath2 . the second characteristic feature are ` dips ' at @xmath28 for the minority spin ( i.e. the ` hole spin ' ) and at @xmath29 , for both spin directions .",
    "these dips are more pronounced for smaller @xmath2 .",
    "the question arises which of these features should be associated with the fs , i.e. do we have a ` large ' fs already for a single hole or is there a ` hole pocket ' at @xmath28 ?",
    "we note that the magnitude of the discontinuity in @xmath0 has to be equal to the weight of the quasiparticle peak in the single particle spectral function , @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath30 has a pronounced@xcite ( and therefore characteristic ) dependence on @xmath2 , a potential fs discontinuity must have the same characteristic dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "then , the ` depth ' of the dip at @xmath28 can be estimated by comparing with a symmetry equivalent @xmath18-point i.e. for @xmath31 we consider @xmath32 , for @xmath33 we study @xmath34 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] these differences are compared to @xmath30 ( obtained from the single particle spectral function for momentum transfer @xmath28 at half - filling ) for various values of @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , @xmath35 over the entire range of @xmath2 , so that that the dip clearly originates from the fermi level crossing of the quasiparticle band , i.e. we have a ` hole pocket ' at @xmath28 .",
    "on the other hand , differences @xmath36 across the ` large ' fs always show the opposite behaviour under a variation of @xmath2 as @xmath30 , indicating that these drops in @xmath0 are unrelated to any fs crossing .",
    "this suggests to associate this structure in @xmath0 with the well - known ` backflow ' for interacting fermi systems@xcite .",
    "such a strong backflow effect is by no means surprising if we consider the change in the single particle greens function upon removing one electron with momentum @xmath28 near the fs : naively one might expect that the only effect be the shift of the quasiparticle peak at @xmath28 from the photoemission to the inverse photoemission spectrum . if this were true , however , the integrated photoemission weight ( which equals the total number of electrons ) had decreased only by @xmath37 .",
    "hence the bulk of spectral weight shift from photoemission to inverse photoemission must occur for momenta @xmath38 , i.e. the strong backflow .",
    "what is remarkable is the wide spread of the backflow in @xmath18-space .",
    "this implies that for each individual @xmath18 the change of @xmath0 due to removal of an electron at @xmath39 is @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the system size . for",
    "a small finite hole concentration @xmath42 it seems reasonable that the backflow contributions from the individual holes are additive , so that the total backflow contribution would scale with @xmath42 . + what remains to be explained are the ` satellite dips ' at @xmath29 .",
    "the most natural explanation are antiferromagnetic spin correlations . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the case @xmath43 , where the state @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 the half - filled ground state ) to good approximation is an eigenstate . for this state @xmath46 with @xmath47 the static spin structure factor of @xmath45 .",
    "since the latter is peaked sharply at @xmath48 we have a natural explanation for the ` satellite dips ' , and it seams reasonable to adopt this explanation also for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "+ summarizing the results obtained so far , we may say that the introduction of a single hole changes @xmath0 in a rather complex way : there is a dip at the momentum of the hole , which originates from the fermi level crossing of the quasiparticle band and thus represents the ` fermi surface ' .",
    "the dip is superimposed over a smooth free - electron - like variation , the familiar many - body backflow . as a consequence of the small quasiparticle weight , this backflow is very pronounced in the @xmath1 model . for later reference",
    "we note that the backflow contribution to @xmath0 to good approximation is a function of @xmath49 only ( this is also confirmed by investigating @xmath0 for other @xmath28 ) . finally , the strong antiferromagnetic spin correlations produce dips also at @xmath50 .",
    "+ this shape of @xmath0 can be easily understood by recalling@xcite that the elementary excitations near the fermi energy are spin bags , where the hole is dressed by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ; a simple calculation in terms of the string picture@xcite reproduces the numerical results quantitatively .",
    "we proceed to the ground state with two holes .",
    "various authors@xcite have found that the free electron - like variation of @xmath0 observed already for a single hole becomes more pronounced for this doping level , and based on the criterion @xmath51@xcite the ` luttinger fermi surfaces ' in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] would be assigned . however , by the same arguments as for a single hole , these luttinger fermi surface are ruled out : fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] compares the @xmath2 dependence of differences @xmath36 across the respective luttinger fs to that of the quasiparticle weight in the spectral function for the two - hole ground state .",
    "@xmath30 decreases sharply , the @xmath36 increase monotonically with @xmath2 .",
    "the drop in @xmath0 upon crossing the large fs thus is obviously unrelated to any true fermi level crossing . instead ,",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath36 is very similar to the backflow contribution for a single hole .",
    "more precisley , if we assume that the backflow for the two holes is simply additive , we expect for the ` large fs ' differences in the two - hole ground state : @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the corresponding differences in the single hole ground state .",
    "[ fig5 ] compares the ` large fs ' @xmath36 with the estimates obtained from ( [ add ] ) by using the @xmath53 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . both the magnitude and the @xmath2 scaling",
    "are predicted very well by ( [ add ] ) , which clearly suggests to associate the ` large fs ' with the backflow contribution .",
    "+ the question then is : what is the true fs and how can we make it visible in @xmath0 ?",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that for a single hole the true fermi surface ( i.e. the hole pocket ) is most clearly visible for large @xmath54 .",
    "this is simply related to the fact that the quasiparticle weight is large in this parameter region ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) . since the @xmath2-scaling of @xmath30 is essentially the same at half - filling and in the two hole ground state , ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] ) we thus may expect to see the clearest fs signatures for large @xmath54 also in the two - hole ground state .",
    "+ for more than one hole , however , we face an additional problem : the strong interaction between the holes , which manifests itself e.g. in a sizeable negative binding energy@xcite . an interacting state of two ` quasiparticles ' reads @xmath55 thus , whereas for a single hole we could fix the location of the pocket simply by choosing the total momentum , in the two - hole ground state the holes will be distributed over different momenta with probability @xmath56 and one may not hope to observe any fs signature unless @xmath57 is well localized in @xmath18-space , i.e. @xmath58 with the quasiparticle ground state @xmath28 .",
    "this in turn necessitates that the interaction energy be smaller than differences in single particle energy between neighboring @xmath18-points , i.e. weak interaction and sufficiently strong dispersion . with this in mind",
    "we add a density interaction term @xmath59@xmath14@xmath60 , to the hamiltonian ; adjusting the parameter @xmath61 , one may hope to reach a situation , where @xmath59 to a certain degree ` cancels ' the intrinsic attractive interaction of the holes . in addition , we include a small next - nearest neighbor hopping term in the hamiltonian , so as to lift the unfavourable ( near ) degeneracy of the quasiparticle dispersion along the surface of the magnetic brillouin zone ; we fix the value of the respective hopping integral to be @xmath62 . for the @xmath24-site cluster this term has the additional advantage that it breaks the spurious additional symmetry due to the mapping to a @xmath63 hypercube and selects a unique two - hole groundstate with momentum @xmath19 .",
    "+ let us stress the following : due to the addition of these terms we are strictly speaking no longer considering the original @xmath3@xmath8@xmath5 model .",
    "it seems quite plausible , however , that if a fs exists at all , its volume should be changed neither by changing the kinetic energy ( @xmath64-term ) nor by introducing an additional interaction ( @xmath61-term ) .",
    "+ to demonstrate the adjustment of @xmath61 , fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the variation of the hole density correlation function @xmath65@xmath14@xmath66 in the two - hole ground states of the @xmath24 and @xmath67 site cluster with @xmath61 ( due to a subtle but understandable pathology in its geometry , analogous results can not be obtained for the @xmath26-site cluster , see appendix ) .",
    "its essentially identical behaviour in both clusters clearly signals a change of the net interaction between the holes from attraction to repulsion . for intermediate values of @xmath61 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath65 is quite homogeneous indicating that the single particle delocalization energy of the holes dominates over their interaction .",
    "given this plus the large @xmath30 we should therefore be in an optimal position for observing the fs",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] show the single particle spectral function @xmath68 for @xmath54@xmath14@xmath69 and the momentum distribution for @xmath54@xmath14@xmath70 and @xmath54@xmath14@xmath69 ( and the respective ` optimal ' @xmath61 ) . in the spectral function",
    ", the chemical potential @xmath71 is located near the top but within a group of pronounced peaks , well separated from another such group in the inverse photoemission spectrum .",
    "there are pronounced peaks both immediately above and below @xmath71 which comprise the bulk of spectral weight for the respective momenta .",
    "corresponding to the well defined ` quasiparticle peaks ' in the spectral function , @xmath0 exhibits a sharp variation : hole pockets at @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "they are superimposed over the familiar backflow contribution , which again has the generic free electron like form so as to ensure negative kinetic energy .",
    "[ fig8 ] also gives the values of the quasiparticle weight for the ` fermi momenta ' .",
    "for @xmath74 in the @xmath67-site cluster the ` quasiparticle peak ' in the phtoemission spectrum ( pes ) actually consists of two peaks with approximately equal weight ; we consider these as a single ` broadened ' peak , so that the two weights should be added .",
    "this is supported by the good agreement with @xmath30 at @xmath75 in the @xmath24-site cluster ( where no splitting occurs ) and the reasonable agreement with the @xmath30 deduced from the inverse photoemission spectrum ( ipes ) at @xmath72 ( where no splitting occurs either ) .",
    "the ` depth ' of the pockets approximately equals @xmath30 and both quantities consistently decrease with decreasing @xmath54 . +",
    "a somewhat astonishing feature of these results is the location of the pockets at @xmath72 rather than at @xmath75 .",
    "this can be traced back to the point group symmetry of the ground two - hole ground state : when the symmetry of the half - filled ground state is @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) , that of the two - hole ground state is @xmath78 ( or @xmath79 ) and vice versa ( the former situation is realized in the @xmath24 and @xmath26-site cluster , the latter in the @xmath67-site cluster ) .",
    "addition of two holes thus always is equivalent to adding an object with @xmath79-symmetry , which implies that the pair wave function @xmath57 in ( [ bound ] ) should have this symmetry as well .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath80 for @xmath18 along @xmath81 , so that occupation of @xmath72 is favoured .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the ` fs discontinuities ' in the @xmath82 cluster under a variation of the repulsion strength @xmath61 .",
    "they show maxima when the density correlation function is most homogeneous , precisely as one would expect for fermions with a variable interaction strength . in the spectral function",
    "the reduction of the discontinuities as @xmath83 manifests itself by the reduction in intensity of the big ipes peak at @xmath72 and the appearance of small low energy ipes peaks at the momenta next to @xmath72 : the pockets are ` washed out ' .",
    "we note that the @xmath36 across the ` large ' fs remains unaffected , another indication that it is unrelated to low - energy physics .",
    "+ a possible explanation for the hole pocket fs would be spin - density - wave - type broken symmetry : although the ground states under consideration are spin singlets , this might be realized if the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization @xmath84 were slow as compared to the hole motion , so that the holes move under the influence of an ` adiabatically varying ' staggered field . a possible criterion for this situation would be @xmath85@xmath86@xmath87@xmath88@xmath89 , where @xmath85 is the time it takes for a hole to transverse the cluster and @xmath87 is the frequency of fluctuations of @xmath84 .",
    "we estimate ( for @xmath90 ) the group velocity of the holes from the dispersion of the ` quasiparticle peak ' in the pes spectrum and , using the energies indicated by arrows in fig .",

    "typical frequencies for fluctuations of @xmath84 can be obtained from its correlation function , which , up to a constant , equals the dynamical spin susceptibility for momentum transfer @xmath27 ; a rigorous lower bound on @xmath87 thus can be obtained by subtracting the ground state energy from the energy of the lowest state with total momentum @xmath27 and the same point group symmetry as the ground state .",

    "[ fig10 ] : the momentum distribution , hole density correlation function and spin correlation function @xmath101 ( with @xmath102 ) .",
    "the density correlation function is homogeneous ( no charge ordering ) , the spin correlations decay rapidly ( no long range antiferromagnetic or spiral ordering ) but still there are unambiguous hole pockets in @xmath0 .",
    "the only possible conclusion is that it is only the large @xmath30 which makes the pockets visible in the large @xmath5 region , and not the onset of any kind of ordering .",
    "+ while the hole pockets can be made clearly visible for large @xmath5 , the situation is more involved for @xmath3@xmath6@xmath5 . in this parameter region",
    "the small overlap between ` quasiparticle ' and ` bare hole ' ( as manifested by the small @xmath30 ) makes the @xmath61-term ( which couples only to the bare hole ) increasingly inefficient in enforcing a noninteracting state : rather than separating from each other , the two holes remain bound on second - nearest neighbors up to fairly large values of @xmath61 and the ` crossover ' from attraction to repulsion , which gave an unambigous prescription for choosing @xmath61 , can not be obtained any more .",
    "we thus abandon both the @xmath61 and @xmath64 terms and adopt a more indirect way of reasoning . + in the single hole case , we found that the pocket was superimposed over the smooth backflow contribution .",
    "we assume that the situation for @xmath69 holes is similar , only with the additional complication that the pockets are now ` washed out ' due to the interaction between holes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "therefore we expect that @xmath0 can be written as @xmath103 with the pair wave function @xmath57 introduced in ( [ bound ] ) . as discussed above ,",
    "the point group symmetry of the two - hole ground state necessitates that @xmath57 has @xmath79 symmetry , so that the pockets are located at @xmath72 .",
    "then , since the symmetry of the ground state is unchanged by adding either the @xmath64 or @xmath61 term , we conclude that this should also hold true in the absence of these terms . +",
    "since @xmath104 to good approximation is a function of @xmath49 only ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , this contribution can be eliminated by forming the difference of two momenta with ( almost ) equal @xmath49 .",
    "next , if we choose one of these momenta along ( or near ) the @xmath81 direction , where the @xmath79-symmetry requires that @xmath57 vanishes ( or is small ) , and the other at ( or near ) @xmath72 we should obtain @xmath105 so that , in contrast to the ` large fs ' differences indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] this difference should scale with @xmath30 . to check this prediction ,",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of various such differences is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] and obviously , they are to excellent approximation proportional to @xmath30 over a wide range of @xmath2 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath2 thus is completely consistent with the assumptions + a ) that there are washed out hole pockets at @xmath72 , + b ) that these are superimposed over the smooth backflow contribution , which is the sum of the backflows for the two individual holes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "while the hole pockets are very clearly visible for large @xmath5 , the evidence for their existence in the physical regime is of a more indirect character .",
    "a comparison with other numerical calculations and experiments on high - temperature superconductors is therefore necessary . as far as numerical studies on small clusters are concerned ,",
    "hole pockets and/or rigid band behaviour upon doping are consistently suggested by most of the available numerical calculations . for the @xmath1 model , poilblanc and dagotto@xcite studied the @xmath68 for single hole states and concluded that the two - hole ground state in the @xmath106 cluster shows hole pockets at @xmath72 , in agreement with the present result . on the other hand ,",

    "in addition to the inconsistent scaling behaviour found above ( fig . [ fig4 ] ) , numerical calculation of @xmath68 for the @xmath67-site cluster@xcite rules out the luttinger fs postulated by stephan and horsch .",

    "finally , a systematic study of the doping dependence of the single particle spectral function@xcite shows rigid - band behaviour , i.e. holes are filled into the quasiparticle band present at half - filling ( which naturally implies hole pockets ) .",
    "+ the situation is quite similar for the hubbard model .",
    "while the generic@xcite free - electron like shape of @xmath0 found in earlier monte - carlo studies@xcite was initially considered as evidence against hole pockets , more careful and systematic analysis@xcite showed that hole pockets are in fact remarkably consistent with the numerical data , their nonobservation in the earlier studies being simply the consequence of thermal smearing .",
    "it seems fair to say that the available numerical results for small clusters of both hubbard and @xmath3@xmath8@xmath5 models , when interpreted with care , are all consistent with rigid band behaviour and/or hole pockets .",
    "+ let us next discuss experimental results on high - temperature superconductors assuming that the hole pockets found in the cluster studies persist in the real systems .",
    "the volume of the fs associated with the @xmath107 plane - derived bands in these materials presents a well - known puzzle : early photoemission experiments@xcite show bands , which disperse towards the fermi energy and vanish at points in @xmath108-space which are roughly located on the free electron fs corresponding to electron density @xmath109 , where @xmath42 is the hole concentration ; on the other hand transport properties can be modelled well@xcite by assuming a fs with a volume @xmath110 . in a fermi liquid",

    "a trivial argument for such a strong @xmath18-dependence of the quasiparticle weight is , that a distribution of pes weight in the brillouin zone ( and hence a @xmath0 ) that resembles the nointeracting fs , always optimizes the expectation value of the kinetic energy .",

    "moreover , it would not be the positions of the electrons which enter this slater determinant , but those of the hole - like quasiparticles , so that we have a very different nature of long range phase coherence .",
    "the fermi surface in an interacting system , being a ` remnant ' of the noninteracting one , is obviously a consequence of the requirements to have minimum kinetic energy and to satisfy the pauli principle . on the other hand , close to half - filling most of the electrons are immobile , so that the gain in kinetic energy from creating the long range phase coherence between electrons ( which is responsible for the singularity of @xmath0 ) may not be very large . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> structures in @xmath0 which were previously interpreted as a ` large ' fermi surface are identified as originating from the well known many - body backflow . to obtain reliable information about the true fermi surface , we focus on the regime @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 , where the backflow effect is weak and suppress the formation of a bound state by introducing a density repulsion between holes . </S>",
    "<S> we find clear signatures of a fermi surface which takes the form of small hole pockets . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the scaling of @xmath0 and that of the quasiparticle weight with @xmath2 suggests that these pockets persist also for @xmath3@xmath6@xmath5 .    </S>",
