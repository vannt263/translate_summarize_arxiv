    "the continuum emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is both highly luminous and rapidly variable , especially for the blazar class ( bl lac objects and violently variable quasars ) . determining the continuum production mechanism is critical for understanding the central engine in agns , a fundamental goal in extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "the observed radiation of blazars is dominated by the emission of a jet whose plasma moves relativistically at small angles to the line of sight ( blandford & rees 1978 ) .",
    "early multiwavelength studies provided the first strong evidence for bulk relativistic motion , later confirmed directly with vlbi observations ( vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) .",
    "however , single epoch spectra can not constrain the models of variability in relativistic jets ( e.g. knigl 1989 ; ulrich et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars shows two broad emission peaks : the lower frequency peak is believed to be produced by synchrotron emission , while the higher frequency peak should be due to the inverse compton process .",
    "the location of the synchrotron peak is used to define different classes of blazars : hbl ( high frequency peak blazar , peaking in the uv or x  ray frequencies ) and lbl ( low frequency peak blazar , peaking in the ir or optical bands ) ( giommi & padovani 1994 ) .    since blazars emit over the entire electromagnetic spectrum , a key for understanding blazar variability is the acquisition of several wide band spectra in different luminosity states during major flaring episodes .",
    "coupling spectral and temporal information greatly constrains the jet physics , since different models predict different variability as a function of wavelength .",
    "important progress in this respect has been achieved recently for some of the brightest and most studied blazars , as pks2155 - 304 ( chiappetti et al .",

    "we successfully used the _ beppo_sax satellite to perform observations of blazars that were known to be in a high state from observations carried out both in other bands ( mainly optical and tev ) and in the x  ray band itself .",
    "the good _ beppo_sax sensitivity and spectral resolution over a very wide x  ray energy range ( 0.1200 kev ) are ideal to constrain the existing models for the x  ray emission .    the bllac object ( , , @xmath1 ) , which had been observed in the x  ray band by _ einstein _",
    "ipc in june 1980 with a 1 kev flux of @xmath2jy ( worrall & wilkes 1990 ) and by rosat pspc in june 1991 with a 1 kev flux of @xmath3jy and energy spectral index @xmath4 ( lamer et al .",

    "1997 ) , had an exceptional optical outburst in april  may 1998 , reaching the most luminous state ever recorded , about 40 mjy in the r band .",
    "the optical broad band spectrum was strongly variable .",
    "in particular , it was very flat at the maximum with a broad band energy spectral index of 0.52 , while before the flare it was found to be 1.4 ; the peak frequency moved from near ir to beyond the b band . during the flare a sudden and large increase of the linear polarisation , from about 3% to 10% ,",
    "was also observed and it remained high at least to the end of may , indicating a non - thermal origin of the burst ( massaro et al .",
    "an optical spectrum of on231 was obtained by weistrop et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and it shows two weak emission features identified with the h@xmath5 ( ew   1 or 2  ) and oiii , from which a redishift estimate of z=0.102 was derived .",
    "no more recent spectra , in particular during the flare , have been published .",
    "following the optical flare , we triggered our x  ray observation and on231 was observed by _",
    "beppo_sax in may , with a second pointing performed a month later , in june .",
    "we measured for the first time the hard x  ray spectrum of this source above 3 kev and in different brightness states . in these occasions",
    "simultaneous optical observations were also performed .",
    "unfortunately the source was already close to the sun and it was impossible to monitor it long enough to search for correlated variability at optical and x  ray frequencies .",
    "in this paper we present and discuss the results of these @xmath0sax observations together with simultaneous optical data .",
    "the _ beppo_sax satellite is the result of an international collaboration between the italian space agency ( asi ) , the netherlands agency for aerospace programs ( nivr ) and the space science department of the european space agency ( ssd - esa ) .",
    "it carries on board four narrow field instruments ( nfi ) pointing in the same direction and covering a very large energy range from 0.1 to 300 kev ( boella et al .",
    "two of the four instruments have imaging capability , the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) , sensitive in the range 0.110 kev ( parmar et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the three medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs ) sensitive in the range 1.310 kev ( boella et al .",
    "the lecs and three mecs detectors are all gas scintillation proportional counters and are at the focus of four identical grazing incidence x  ray telescopes .",
    "the other two are passively collimated instruments : the high pressure proportional counter ( hpgspc ) , sensitive in the range 4120 kev ( manzo et al .",
    "1997 ) and the phoswich detector systems ( pds ) , sensitive in the range 13300 kev ( frontera et al . 1997 ) . for a full description of the _ beppo_sax mission",

    "ray band is symmetrical ( equal rise and decay timescale ) , suggesting that the variability timescale is determined by the light crossing time of the emitting region , @xmath6 ( see chiaberge & ghisellini 1999 ) .",
    "this in turn implies that the cooling time is shorter than @xmath6 , allowing us to put limits on the value of the magnetic field and on the energy of the electrons producing the variable flux at the oberved frequency @xmath7 . using @xmath8 hours and @xmath9 hz",
    ", we derive @xmath10 gauss and @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12^{-1}$ ] is the doppler beaming factor , where @xmath13 is the viewing angle .",
    "since the peak of the synchrotron emission must be at a frequency @xmath14 hz , the corresponding lorentz factor of the electrons emitting at the peak is @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that the peak of the self compton flux is at @xmath16 mev .",
    "tighter constraints can be obtained assuming that the optical and x  ray emission are cospatial , and that also the cooling time of the optical emitting electrons is shorter than the light crossing time .",
    "massaro et al . ( 1999 ) report intranight variations in the i and b bands of 0.2 magnitude in 1 hour , with an approximately symmetric time profile . assuming again @xmath8 hours , we obtain @xmath17 gauss and @xmath18 .",
    "the far ir to @xmath19ray emission from blazars can be explained by simple homogeneous and one  zone synchrotron inverse compton models , with the emitting region moving relativistically towards the observer .",
    "the inverse compton emission may have two components : the first is produced by relativistic electrons scattering off locally produced synchrotron photons ( ssc ) , while the second corresponds to the scattering of photons produced in other regions ( ec ) , either elsewhere in the jet or by the broad emission line clouds , or by some scattering plasma within these clouds .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , analyzing all blazars of known redshift detected by egret with spectral information in the @xmath19ray band , found that the ec component decreases its contribution as the total luminosity decreases , with lowest luminosity bl lac objects requiring a negligible amount of ec .",
    "we applied a pure ssc model to the sed of on 231 , as shown in fig.[fig : sed ] .",
    "in particular we have tried to explain the different sed by changing the minimum number of parameters .",
    "the applied models assume to continuously inject , in a spherical source of radius @xmath20 embedded in a tangled magnetic field @xmath21 , relativistic electrons with a power law energy distribution @xmath22 , between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the total luminosity injected in the form of relativistic electrons is @xmath25 , calculated in the comoving frame .",
    "we also assumed to observe the source at the viewing angle @xmath26 , so that the doppler factor @xmath27 .",
    "the steady  state particle distribution is the result of the injection and cooling processes , and we also account for possible escape of the particles , which may be relevant for on 231 . it is assumed that particles escape at some velocity @xmath28 , independent of their energy .",
    "further details about this model can be found in ghisellini et al .",
    "the input parameters for the models shown in fig.[fig : sed ] are given in table 3 .",
    "the size of the source and the doppler factor have been kept fixed ; the slope @xmath29 of the injected electron distribution and @xmath24 are similar",
    ". the magnetic field does not change , while @xmath30 changes by @xmath31 , from 2300 to 3000 .",
    "the largest change concerns the injected power , increasing from @xmath32 erg s@xmath33 ( 1991 model ) , to @xmath34 erg s@xmath33 ( 1998 model ) , an increase of a factor 7 . within the ssc model ,",
    "it is not possible to account for the very hard @xmath19ray spectrum of 19911992 .",
    "the quasi  simultaneous optical data requires the peak of the optical emission to be at frequencies between the near ir and the optical , while the hard egret spectrum indicates that the compton peak is at energies greater than a few gev .",
    "this translates in a lower limit for the energy of the electron emitting at the peaks of @xmath35 .",
    "these electrons emit at @xmath36 hz if the magnetic field @xmath37 gauss .",
    "this is not consistent with the limits derived in the previous section .",
    "in addition , a small magnetic field would imply a very large radiation to magnetic energy density ratio , @xmath38 , and then an excessive self compton flux , unless the doppler factor is exceedingly large ( @xmath39 , see eq .",
    "2.5 and 2.6 in ghisellini et al .",
    "we then conclude that either the hard 19911992 @xmath19ray spectrum is due to another source , or , if it will be confirmed to be associated with on 231 , is produced by another component ( i.e. to inverse compton scattering with photons produced externally to the jet ) .",
    "note that bl lacertae showed a similar behavior ( hardening of the @xmath19ray spectrum ) during the flare of summer 1997 ( bloom et al .",
    "this was interpreted ( sambruna et al . 1999 ; madejski et al . 1999 ; bottcher & bloom 1999 ) as due to an increased contribution of emission line photons to the inverse compton scattering process .",
    "something similar could have happened also to on 231 ( during the 19911992 egret observation ) , but the lack of spectroscopic observations preclude any further conclusions .    what is interesting , and peculiar , in on 231 is the sharp flattening , above @xmath40 kev , of the x  ray spectrum .",
    "a population of electrons which cools only radiatively can not account for spectra as flat as observed in on 231 : the flattest predicted spectrum in the case of radiative cooling has an energy spectral index @xmath41 ( see e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "we therefore must invoke an additional mechanism .",
    "one likely possibility is escape . in this case",
    "high energy electrons would cool before escaping , while low energy electrons would preferentially escape before cooling radiatively .",
    "the corresponding steady  state particle distribution would then show a flattening towards the low energy part , accounting for the very flat inverse compton component emerging above 4 kev . the model we have applied to on 231 indicates that @xmath42@xmath43 , corresponding to an escape time of the order of 23 light crossing times @xmath6",
    ".    the variability predicted by the model can account for the observed variability in the soft x ",
    "ray band and for the much less variable hard x  ray flux , even if the bolometric luminosity does not change .",
    "this can be achieved by changing ( even by a small amount ) the slope @xmath29 of the injected electron distribution , without changing the total injected power .",
    "this will change the synchrotron spectrum above the synchrotron peak ( characterized by @xmath44 ) , but not the flux below , nor the self compton flux below the compton peak , produced by low energy electrons scattering low frequency synchrotron photons .",
    "the @xmath0sax data of on 231 show that this source can be considered a bl lac object intermediate between the hbl and lbl sources .",
    "the concave shape of the x  ray spectrum in the 0.110 kev band can be used to define the class of intermediate blazars , which should be characterized , in this band , by the presence of the steep tail of the synchrotron radiation and the hard emerging of the compton emission .",
