    "over the past 15 years , the original proposal of bender and co - workers that systems with @xmath0-symmetry may constitute relevant extensions of the usual hermitian quantum mechanical models has gained considerable traction .",
    "part of the reason for the interest in this theme has been the theoretical proposal  @xcite , but perhaps especially so the experimental implementation  @xcite in linear and nonlinear optics of systems that follow the proposed @xmath0-symmetric dynamics .",
    "more recently , similar systems have been implemented in electrical  @xcite and mechanical  @xcite linear systems , as well in the realm of whispering - gallery microcavities  @xcite and in a @xmath0-symmetric dimer of van - der - pol oscillators in  @xcite .    in numerous ones among these systems ( e.g. in  @xcite ) ,",
    "the underlying linear dynamics is of the oscillator type i.e. , it involves a dimer of two oscillators , one with loss and one with gain , typically in the form of a linear dashpot .",
    "the relevant oscillator pair reads ( at the linear level ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the frequency of the oscillators , @xmath3 their coupling , while @xmath4 is strength of the loss / gain in the two oscillators @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this , in turn , has motivated a number of studies that considered both the discrete  @xcite , as well as the long - wavelength continuum  @xcite generalization of such models in the realm of klein - gordon partial differential equations of the form ( now for the field @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is anti - symmetric in order to enable regions of loss ( with @xmath10 ) and gain ( with @xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 contains the nonlinearity potentially present in the model .    here",
    ", we explore the long - wavelength limit of a modified form of the oscillator problem whereby the oscillation of @xmath5 involves a dashpot effect from @xmath6 and that of @xmath6 a gain effect from @xmath5 .",
    "this type of velocity dependent coupling has been argued , for instance , to exist in the coupling of pendula in the recent experiments and associated modeling of  @xcite . our own investigation ,",
    "however , is chiefly motivated by the the continuum properties of the corresponding long - wavelength limit mathematical system which in this case will be of the following klein - gordon form , again for the field @xmath7 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a real - valued and bounded potential and @xmath15 is a real parameter .",
    "we will give general stability conditions involving @xmath14 , although our interest will be chiefly towards the @xmath0-symmetric case , whereby the invariance under @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as well as @xmath18 clearly indicates that @xmath19 and @xmath14 should be an even function to ensure @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "an alternative way of thinking of this partial differential equation ( pde ) is as a schrdinger model with an added inertial term .",
    "this , in turn , suggests the underlying conservative nature of this pde , which we will not explore further below but which will be somewhat implicit in our spectral considerations .    in what follows , we will be interested in standing wave solutions in the form @xmath20 , with real - valued carrier @xmath21 , which naturally satisfy @xmath22 the equation will have homoclinic orbit , pulse - like solutions under appropriate conditions on the nonlinearity @xmath23 and the function @xmath9 .",
    "for example , if @xmath24 for some @xmath25 and @xmath14 is a bounded function , one can show that a ( positive ) solution to may be obtained as a ( multiple of ) the solution to the following constrained minimization problem @xmath26dx\\to \\min   \\\\",
    "\\int_{{{\\mathbf r}^d } } h^{p+1}(x ) dx = 1 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] in all these cases , the present work will focus on the spectral stability of such solutions . in order to study this question , we linearize by @xmath27 $ ] . by keeping the linear terms and ignoring all higher terms @xmath28",
    ", we arrive at @xmath29=0.\\ ] ] furthermore , introducing the vector @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 we now give a definition for stability / instability of such linearizations .",
    "we say that the linearized problem is spectrally unstable , if there is @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 otherwise , we say that the linearized problem is spectrally stable .",
    "we should mention that eigenvalue problems of this type have been considered in the literature ; see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "in fact , they are frequently referred to as operator pencils .",
    "this is due to the quadratic dependence on the eigenvalue parameter in .",
    "the following general result helps us decide about the stability of such pencils .",

    "that is , the kernel of @xmath45 may be one dimensional , in which case , @xmath46 is vacuous .",
    "our aim in the present work is to quantify this general theorem in the special case of the operator pencils discussed above in  ( [ 40 ] ) .",
    "more specifically , in section 2 , we give the precise condition that is relevant to our operator pencil . in section 3 , we give a series of specific examples for power law nonlinearities and particular forms of @xmath9 . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider some typical ones among these examples numerically and corroborate the prediction of the theorem .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we present our conclusions and propose some possibilities for future work .",
    "let us start by saying a few words on how our principal example of satisfies the requirements of theorem [ theo:10 ] .",

    "the split @xmath37 is then not hard to guess , namely @xmath48 , @xmath49 clearly , the requirements @xmath50 are satisfied , since the operators @xmath51 are self - adjoint with a domain @xmath52 and @xmath53 , while @xmath54 .",

    "thus , in the 1 d case by sturm - liouville theory , it follows that @xmath57 , with a ( normalized ) eigenfunction @xmath58 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath59 satisfies the condition @xmath60 is non - trivial .",
    "namely , we need @xmath59 to have at most one negative eigenvalue ( counting multiplicities ) and @xmath61 $ ] be empty or @xmath61=span[\\psi_1 , \\ldots , \\psi_l]$ ] .",
    "if the second possibility occurs , then we need to make sure , by @xmath46 , that @xmath62 .",
    "this will actually turn out to be automatic in our case .",
    "the following is the main result of the present contribution .",

    "@xmath59 always has negative point spectrum .",
    "the requirement is therefore asking for such spectrum to be reduced to a single point .",
    "we first show that it suffices to require only and then our pencil satisfies the assumptions of theorem [ theo:10 ] .",

    "numerical results also show that as @xmath15 increases , the value of @xmath168 decreases .",
    "hence , our numerical computations indeed illustrate the sharpness of the relevant criterion .",
    "in the present work , we have considered , motivated by @xmath0-symmetric considerations and perturbations respecting the parity and time - reversal symmetries , to explore a variant of the recently explored @xmath0-symmetric klein - gordon systems , which also can be thought of as a schrdinger type equation with additional inertial terms . for this pde",
    ", we have explored the general stability criterion of  @xcite in order to derive a more precise / specific stability condition .",
    "the latter has the natural form of an extension to the well - known vakhitov - kolokolov criterion of nonlinear schrdinger type models .",
    "the relevant inequality has not only been theoretically proposed and directly computed in some simple case examples ( such as @xmath88 ) , but its sharpness has been numerically corroborated in analytically intractable forms of the relevant function .",
    "nevertheless , there are numerous extensions of the present setting that may still be relevant to explore . while , partially also due to space restrictions , here we constrained ourselves and our numerical study to the prototypical cubic case , it would be interesting to explore more general ( power or other e.g. saturable ) nonlinearities that may well impart additional instabilities , as well as provide settings where the setup of the theorem will not apply . here , the numerical computations may provide insights towards suitable generalizations . also , considering more complex forms of @xmath9 may provide multiple changes of monotonicity ( of the relevant quantity of the theorem ) , and it would be interesting to seek the corresponding stability reversals . finally , in the case of one or more of these instabilities , it would be useful to dynamically investigate the fate of the resulting dynamical evolutions .",
