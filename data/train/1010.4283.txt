    "nuclear reactions are the engine of stellar evolution and determine the overall production of the known chemical elements and their isotopes in a variety of nucleosynthesis patterns .",
    "a detailed understanding of the characteristic production and depletion rates of nuclei within the framework of a nucleosynthesis process is crucial for reliable model predictions and the interpretation of the observed abundances .    instead of the number @xmath2 of nuclei of a given species per volume @xmath3 ( the number density @xmath4 ) , it is advantageous to use a quantity independent of density changes : the abundance @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the plasma density and @xmath7 denotes avogadro s number .",
    "the change of abundances @xmath8 with time due to nuclear processes is traced by coupled differential equations . due to the nature of the involved reactions and the vastly different timescales appearing , the equation system is non - linear and stiff .",
    "in addition , for complete solubility of the coupled equations the number of equations @xmath9 has to equal the number of involved nuclei acting as reaction partners and thus an equation matrix of size @xmath10 has to be solved .",
    "nucleosynthesis processes include thousands of nuclides and tens of thousands reactions .",
    "this still makes it impossible to fully couple such a reaction network to a full set of hydrodynamic equations as would be required for a complete modeling of nucleosynthesis in a given astrophysical site .",
    "a reaction network generally can be written as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 numbers the nucleus , @xmath13 is the @xmath14th rate for destruction or creation of the @xmath15th nucleus without a nuclear projectile involved ( this includes spontaneous decay , lepton capture , photodisintegration ) , and @xmath16 is the rate of the @xmath14th reaction involving a nuclear projectile and creating or destroying nucleus @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , we have three - body reactions where nucleus @xmath15 is produced or destroyed together with two other ( or similar ) nuclei .",

    "two - body rates @xmath22 include the abundances of two interacting particles or nuclei .",

    "the number of reactions per volume and time is given by @xmath36 and involves the reaction cross section @xmath37 as a function of velocity , the relative velocity @xmath35 and the thermodynamic distributions of target and projectile @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the evaluation of this integral depends on the type of particles ( fermions , bosons ) and distributions which are involved .    however , many two - body reactions can be simplified and effectively expressed similarly to one - body reactions , only depending on one abundance ( or number density ) .",
    "if reaction partner @xmath32 is a photon , the relative velocity is always @xmath38 and the quantities in the integral do not depend on @xmath34 .",
    "this simplifies the rate expression to @xmath39 where @xmath40 stems from an integration over a planck distribution for photons of temperature @xmath41 .",
    "this is similar to the decay rates introduced earlier and therefore we replaced @xmath22 by @xmath21 in our notation and can include this type of reaction in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : network ] ) .",
    "a similar procedure is used for electron captures by protons and nuclei . because the electron is about 2000 times less massive than a nucleon , the velocity of the nucleus is negligible in the center - of - mass system in comparison to the electron velocity ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the electron capture cross section has to be integrated over a fermi distribution of electrons .",
    "the electron capture rates are a function of the plasma temperature @xmath41 and the electron number density @xmath43 . in a neutral , completely ionized plasma ,",

    "furthermore , at high densities ( @xmath48g@xmath49 ) the size of the neutrino scattering cross section on nucleons , nuclei , and electrons ensures that enough scattering events occur to lead to a continuous neutrino energy distribution",

    "the nuclear cross section @xmath55 is defined as in standard scattering theory by @xmath56 however , in an astrophysical plasma reactions not only proceed on the ground state of a nucleus but also from excited states .",
    "this is implied in the notation for the modified cross section @xmath57 , contrasting the usual laboratory cross section ( denoted by @xmath55 or @xmath58 ) for reactions acting only on the ground state of the target nucleus .",
    "the implications of using such a cross section modified in the stellar plasma , instead of the usual laboratory one , will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : stellar ] . it should be noted that @xmath59 may be a function not only of energy but also of plasma temperature .",

    "the angle brackets stand for the appropriate averaging , i.e.  integration , over the energy distribution .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we will be concerned with the determination of this reactivity and the involved cross sections , respectively .",
    "before we proceed to the details of the determination of the reaction cross sections , it is instructive to further investigate the rate equation and to derive the relevant energies at which the nuclear reaction cross sections have to be known .",
    "although the integral in eq .  ( [ eq : rate ] ) runs to infinity , the mbd folded with the cross section selects a comparatively narrow energy range with non - negligible contributions to the total value of the integral .",
    "historically , this energy range is called the gamow window because gamow realized early on the astrophysical relevance of the fact that  if the energy dependence of the cross section is dominated by the coulomb barrier between the projectile and the target  the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) can be factorized as@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the astrophysical @xmath65-factor @xmath66 which is assumed to be only weakly dependent on the energy @xmath67 for non - resonant reactions .",
    "the second exponential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : penet ] ) is called the gamow factor and contains an approximation of the coulomb penetration with the sommerfeld parameter @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 are the charges of projectile @xmath32 and target @xmath31 , respectively , and @xmath62 is their reduced mass . while the first exponential ( the tail of the mbd ) decreases with increasing energy , the gamow factor increases , leading to a confined peak of the integrand , the so - called gamow peak .",
    "the location of the peak @xmath71 is shifted to higher energies with respect to the maximum of the mbd at @xmath72 ( @xmath73 mev when @xmath74 is the plasma temperature in gk ) .",
    "the width of the peak gives the astrophysically relevant energy range in which most of the reactions will take place .    in absence of a coulomb barrier the energy dependence of the non - resonant cross section",
    "is roughly given by the one of the wave number of the particle ( @xmath75 ) folded with the angular momentum barrier .",
    "this does not , however , lead to a relevant shift of the peak of the integrand compared to the peak of the mbd .",
    "thus , the effective energy window for neutrons is simply the peak of the mbd .",
    "the above considerations concerning the location and size of the energy window have given rise to simple approximation formulae extensively used by experimentalists to estimate the energies of interest .",
    "for instance , with a charged projectile the location @xmath76 and width @xmath77 of the gamow window is often computed from @xmath78 which is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : penet ] ) assuming a gaussian shape of the peak and using appropriate numerical constants , yielding @xmath76 and @xmath77 in mev.@xcite this approximation of the gamow window @xmath79 is valid for some but not all cases because it is oversimplified .",
    "the above factorization with the given sommerfeld parameter including the charges of projectile @xmath32 and target",
    "@xmath31 implicitly assumes that the energy dependence of the cross section is given by the coulomb penetration in the entrance channel @xmath80 of the reaction @xmath81 .",
    "it has been realized , however , that sometimes resonances below the gamow window derived with the above approximation significantly contribute to the reaction rate for certain capture reactions.@xcite in those considered cases the energy dependence of the cross section is dominated by the energy dependence of the @xmath82 width in the exit channel instead of the charged particle width in the entrance channel . this can be generalized@xcite and leads to the important realization that the energy dependence of the integrand @xmath83 has to be numerically examined in order to derive reliable energy windows .",
    "this has been generally and extensively studied in ref .  . here",
    ", only a few examples are shown .",
    "figure [ fig : sn112pa ] shows a comparison between the actual @xmath83 and the integrand assumed with the standard approximation . in this case , the relative shift of the energy window is to higher energy because of the higher coulomb barrier in the exit channel .",
    "in other cases , the shifts can also be to much lower energy than predicted by the standard approximation",
    ".    for a detailed understanding of these differences one has to realize that both resonant and hauser - feshbach cross sections ( see secs .  [ sec : reso ] ,  [ sec : statmod ] ) can be expressed as@xcite @xmath84 with @xmath85 being either breit - wigner widths or averaged hauser - feshbach widths , depending on the context .",
    "the width of the entrance channel is given by @xmath86 , the one of the exit channel by @xmath87 , and the total width including all possible emission channels from a given resonance or compound state with spin @xmath88 by @xmath89    it has become common knowledge that a cross section of the form shown in eq .  ( [ eq : cs ] ) is determined by the properties of the smaller width in the numerator if no other channels than the entrance and exit channel contribute significantly to @xmath90 ( see also sec .  [ sec : sensigeneral ] ) .",
    "then @xmath90 cancels with the larger width in the numerator and the smaller width remains .",
    "( the effect is less pronounced and requires a more detailed investigation when other channels are non - negligible in @xmath90 . ) in consequence , the energy - dependence of the cross section will then be governed by the energy dependence of this smallest @xmath91 . only if this happens to be the charged - particle ( averaged ) width in the entrance channel , the use of the standard formula for the gamow window ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : e0approx ] , [ eq : deltaapprox ] ) will be justified .",
    "since @xmath92 and @xmath93 have different energy dependences , it will depend on the specific energy ( weighted by the mbd ) which of the widths is smaller .",
    "therefore , the above approximation should not be applied blindly but rather the actual gamow windows have to be determined from the true energy dependence by inspection of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "extensive tables of revised effective energy ranges for astrophysics from such a numerical inspection are given in ref .  .",
    "these ranges can be shifted by several mev to higher or lower energy compared to the ones obtained with the standard formula .",
    "furthermore it is found that the assumption of a gaussian shape of @xmath83 is untenable for the majority of cases with intermediate and heavy target nuclei .",
    "rather , the integrand @xmath83 may show a pronounced asymmetry around its maximum value .",
    "therefore , the energy of the maximum alone is not sufficient to determine the astrophysically relevant energy range .    although derived from cross sections of a specific model prediction , the energy windows given in ref .",
    "are supposed to be robust .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that they mainly depend on the relative energy dependence of the acting reaction channels and not the absolute value of the cross sections .",
    "this dependence is governed by the relative energy and the coulomb barrier seen in each reaction channel .",
    "therefore , the limits of the energy windows are set by the knowledge of the charges of the nuclei involved in the different reaction channels , and the reaction @xmath94-values",
    ". only the latter may be unknown for nuclei far off stability and mass measurements may have an impact .",
    "another important consequence of using the correct energy dependence is that different reactions may not have necessarily the same effective energy window , even when projectile and target nucleus are the same .",
    "this is immediately seen when considering the case of a reaction with a positive @xmath94-value for one channel but a negative one for another reaction channel .",
    "the astrophysically relevant energy window of the exothermic reaction may lie below the threshold of the other reaction channel .",
    "obviously , the relevant energy window for the endothermic channel can not open below the threshold energy and thus has to lie at higher energies than the one for the capture .",
    "a randomly chosen example for such a reaction pair would be @xmath95pd(p,@xmath82)@xmath96ag and @xmath95pd(p , n)@xmath95ag , with the energy windows at @xmath97 mev and @xmath98 mev , respectively , for a plasma temperature of 2 gk.@xcite below the ( p , n ) threshold at 5.06 mev , the ( p , n ) cross section is zero and does not give a contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "this also further illustrates the limitation of the standard approximation which yields identical energy windows for reactions with identical entrance channels but different exit channels .",
    "it has to be noted , though , that the effective energy windows only point out the energy range contributing mostly to the rate integral at given stellar temperature but do not make a statement on the size of the rate or its astrophysical relevance .",
    "it has already been mentioned that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) applies to reactions either exhibiting isolated resonances treatable by a breit - wigner resonance formula or smooth cross sections stemming from an averaging over a large number of narrowly spaced and unresolved resonances .",
    "therefore the derived energy windows are also applicable to obtain the relevant energy ranges in which narrow resonances have to be considered .",
    "they do not , however , specify the relative strengths of the resonances within a given window .    definition ( [ eq : sfactor ] ) only makes sense when using the laboratory cross section @xmath99 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : labcs ] ) in the following section ) .",
    "strictly speaking , with the laboratory cross section the energy windows apply to laboratory measurements only , i.e.  to the determination of the ground state component of the actual stellar cross section . for low stellar temperatures and positive @xmath94-values ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : stellar ] ) , however , this will dominate the stellar cross section .",
    "relevant energy windows can also be derived numerically for stellar cross sections ( see next section ) , of course , in the same manner . since these can not be measured ( yet ) , they may be of limited use , though .    a general scrutiny of the astrophysically relevant energy windows up to a plasma temperature of 5 gk ( above this temperature , reaction equilibria are established which do not require the knowledge of individual rates ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    ") shows that the appearing interaction energies are small by nuclear physics standards . for neutron - induced reactions ,",
    "the encountered maximum energies are a few hundred kev , depending on the examined nucleosynthesis process ( e.g. , in the @xmath100 process they are more like 8 - 60 kev).@xcite the relevant energy windows are shifted to higher energies for charged reactants , with a few mev for reactions with protons and several mev up to about 10 mev for reactions involving @xmath0 particles .",
    "the formulae given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e0approx ] ) , ( [ eq : deltaapprox ] ) are inadequate for the determination of these energies and should not be used anymore .",
    "in an astrophysical plasma , nuclei quickly ( on the timescale of nuclear reactions and scattering ) reach thermal equilibrium with all plasma components .",
    "this allows thermal excitation of nuclei which follows a boltzmann law and gives rise to the _ stellar _ cross section @xmath101 where the sum runs over all excited states @xmath102 of the target nucleus @xmath31 ( for simplicity , here we assume the projectile @xmath32 , i.e.  the second reaction partner , does not have excited states ) with spin factor @xmath103 and excitation energy @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the stellar cross section is the sum of cross sections @xmath105 ( evaluated at their respective center - of - mass energies @xmath106 with @xmath107 when @xmath108 ) for reactions on a nucleus in excited state @xmath102 , weighted by the population coefficient @xmath109 .",
    "the above relation can be derived from a saha equation@xcite .",

    "likewise , the sums appearing in ( [ eq : csstar ] ) can be amended with a supplemental integration over the level density above the last discrete level used .",
    "although the product of the boltzmann factor @xmath117 and @xmath115 does not have a trivial energy dependence , it has been shown that for the application of ( [ eq : partfuncint ] ) at temperatures @xmath118 gk it is sufficient to integrate only up to @xmath119 mev.@xcite temperatures above 10 gk are encountered in some explosive astrophysical events , in accretion disks , and in the formation of neutron stars and black holes .",

    "having assured that the approximation of the planck distribution in the derivation of ( [ eq : revphoto ] ) does not introduce a considerable error in the obtained rates , it is important to realize that further conditions have to be fulfilled to allow the application of the relations discussed above . we started from introducing a thermal population @xmath109 in ( [ eq : csstar ] ) above and consequently all derivations up to here depend on the assumption that the excited states in all participating nuclei are occupied according to this population factor .",
    "this is a valid assumption for most astrophysical plasmas and most nuclei reach thermal equilibrium very rapidly through collisions and interactions with photons and other plasma components .",
    "however , there are some nuclei which exhibit long - lived isomeric states ( well - known examples are @xmath182al , @xmath183lu , and @xmath184ta)@xcite with such spins that they can not be easily excited or de - excited through electromagnetic transitions . at sufficiently high temperature they may still get into equilibrium , sometimes through couplings to intermediate states , but the relevant transitions have to be carefully studied .",
    "this can be achieved through an internal reaction network , not connecting different nuclei but rather including the different levels within one nucleus.@xcite levels not being in thermal equilibrium can be included in regular networks in such a manner as if they were a different nucleus .",

    "this also applies when ensembles of excited states are in equilibrium but the different ensembles within a nucleus are not .",
    "then each ensemble can be treated as a separate species in a reaction network and the reactions connecting the ensembles have to be included explicitly .",
    "although not discussed in further detail here , it is worth mentioning that also weak interactions are affected by the thermal population of excited states .",
    "for example , the @xmath27-decay half - life @xmath185 of a nucleus will be changed relative to its ground state half - life when the ground state becomes depopulated and excited states with different decay half - lives are populated .",
    "thus , the decay `` constant '' @xmath186 is actually temperature - dependent @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 is the decay lifetime of the excited state .",
    "similar considerations also apply to other processes , such as electron capture and neutrino - induced reactions .",
    "using the reciprocity relations derived above allows to simplify the full reaction networks as defined in ( [ eq : network ] ) .",
    "such simplifications are instructive because they enable us to study nucleosynthesis properties which are independent of details in the hydrodynamic evolution of the system or even , as shown below , independent of individual reaction rates .",
    "they usually go along with a restriction to only types of reactions in the network which are actually necessary instead of blindly evolving a large system of differential equations .",
    "such an approach is not always feasible but considerable understanding of nucleosynthesis has been gained in the past through such means by circumventing the necessity of computationally intensive calculations .",
    "such simplifications remain important today because it is still impossible to couple multi - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to full reaction networks .",
    "furthermore , restriction to the essential often provides a much better insight into the physical processes than a brute - force full network calculation .",
    "here we are concerned with the simplifications because it has to be understood when it is necessary to know astrophysical reaction rates and when not .    setting the abundance change @xmath190 on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : network ] )",
    "implies that the sum of all rates destroying the nuclear species @xmath15 is exactly balanced by all production rates and the net change in abundance is therefore zero , leaving the abundance constant .",
    "this is called _ steady flow equilibrium_. it is especially useful with reaction chains where most rates ( perhaps except one ) are in steady flow equilibrium",
    ". then the slowest reaction sets the timescale of the reaction flow and all other reactions adjust .",
    "as long as steady flow is upheld , no full reaction network has to be solved .",
    "rather , the ratios of the steady flow abundances of the involved nuclei are related by the ratios of their net destruction rates ( or , equivalently , production rates as these have to be the same ) . for illustration ,",
    "let us assume a chain of reactions @xmath191 connecting nuclei through reactions with the same projectile , where all net reactions are in steady flow and therefore the same , except for the one starting at nucleus @xmath31 . then @xmath192 and @xmath193 the slowest rate sets the abundance of @xmath194 through @xmath195 .",

    "local approximation _ in s - process studies .",
    "a slightly different concept is to assume equilibrium between a forward and its reverse rate .",

    "the individual rates do not appear anymore in the relation between the abundances .",
    "note that this does not imply that the abundances remain constant , they still depend on @xmath41 which may vary with time as well as on @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",

    "cross sections @xmath225 measured in terrestrial laboratories do not include thermal effects . therefore the rates derived from them do not obey reciprocity relations . to derive astrophysical rates appropriate for the utilization in reaction networks , laboratory cross sections almost always have to be supplemented by theory to account for the additional transitions not included in the measurement .",
    "the energy- and temperature - dependent stellar enhancement factor for the cross sections ( again obtained via theory ) @xmath226 compares the stellar cross section including reactions from thermally populated excited states to the cross section obtained with reactions proceeding from the ground state of the target nucleus only .",

    "then the fraction of the ground state contribution to the stellar rate is @xmath229 .    on the other hand , @xmath230 is supposed to provide information for the experimentalist on how much off the measured @xmath231 is in comparison to @xmath224 at each energy for a given stellar temperature . to this end",

    "let us start with the dependence on stellar temperature .",
    "naively , one would assume that the higher the temperature , the larger the stellar enhancement will become .",
    "indeed , this is often the case but there are further intricacies .",
    "there are two dependences on @xmath41 appearing in ( [ eq : sefrate ] ) , one in the rate in the numerator and the other in the normalized partition function in the denominator .",
    "the latter is monotonically increasing with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "the integration of the product of the effective cross section and the mbd may show a different @xmath41-dependence , however , which even may not prove to be monotonic .",

    "since the effective cross section sums over transitions with relative energies @xmath242 and @xmath243 , it becomes obvious that the higher the relevant energy window , the more transitions are included .",
    "this does not necessarily result in an increased rate although it often will .",
    "it is also conceivable that the additionally included transitions at large @xmath41 have small cross sections and do not provide a considerable increase in the rate .",
    "depending on the type of reaction , cross sections for transitions already included at small @xmath41 may also decrease with increasing relative energy . in these cases , @xmath228 will be reduced at larger @xmath41 because @xmath234 is always increasing . the stellar `` enhancement '' may even become smaller than unity and not live up to its name anymore .",
    "this behavior should not be viewed as monotonic , either , because as additional transitions become accessible at even larger @xmath41 the stellar rate again may increase faster than @xmath234 .",
    "it is to be expected , however , that @xmath228 is decreasing to very small values for very large @xmath41 after having reached a maximum value , i.e. , for very high ( but not necessarily astrophysically important ) temperatures @xmath244 will always be achieved .",
    "this is because with increasing relevant energy @xmath245 other reaction channels become increasingly important , reducing the cross sections of the individual transitions .",
    "additionally , more unbound levels will be included in the effective cross section .",
    "these may lose particles to other reaction channels ( e.g. , through pre - equilibrium emission ; see also sec .  [",
    "sec : statmod ] ) and also not contribute to the effective cross section anymore .",
    "it was suggested in ref .   to include only bound states in the definition of the effective cross section .",
    "although this may be a good approximation , it may neglect some transitions which still can contribute to the effective cross section at high temperature .",
    "note , however , that unbound states may not be in thermal equilibrium although the timescale for reaching equilibrium under stellar burning conditions is short compared to the one of a nuclear reaction.@xcite a more suitable cutoff , if required , would be the energy @xmath246 appearing as cutoff in the calculation of the partition function in ( [ eq : partfuncint ] ) , although this may include already too many transitions with negligible cross sections .",

    "the average level spacings typically are larger than @xmath266 kev and thus @xmath255 remains close to unity , with a few notable exceptions .",
    "the r - process@xcite involves neutron captures at temperatures of @xmath267 gk which translates to a location of the mbd peak at @xmath268 kev and we will expect slightly larger @xmath255 than for the s - process on average .     and @xmath269 in the initial and final nucleus , respectively , under the assumption of a positive reaction @xmath94-value @xmath270 . in both nuclei a few low - lying states",
    "are explicitly numbered , above them nuclear level densities are indicated ( shaded areas ) .",
    "[ fig : excweights2],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    reactions having their relevant energy window determined by charged particle widths have considerably larger @xmath76 , in the range of about @xmath271 mev , depending on the stellar temperature and the charges of the interacting particles .",
    "accordingly , @xmath255 can already become large at rather low temperature because transitions from many excited states have to be considered . only in light ,",
    "strongly bound nuclei with level spacings of several mev above the ground state , @xmath255 may still remain close to unity .",
    "the relative effective weights @xmath272 derived in ( [ eq : effweights ] ) also allow to understand a rule - of - thumb which has been known , but never quantified , for quite some time ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the rule states that exothermic reactions ( @xmath273 ) usually have smaller @xmath255 than their endothermic inverses . defining the forward reactions by the exothermic reaction and the reverse reaction by its endothermic counterpart ,",
    "this means that @xmath274 and frequently @xmath275 .",
    "this is not immediately comprehensible upon inspection of the boltzmann weights @xmath260 as these seem to act similarly in the initial and final nuclei . as stated above , however , it is a mistake to straightforwardly use the @xmath260 together with a single mbd .",
    "the rule becomes obvious when using the appropriate @xmath259 .",
    "the situation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : excweights2 ] where the behavior of the weights is shown for two nuclei @xmath31 and @xmath129 being the target and the final nucleus of a reaction , respectively . for the relevant interaction energy set to @xmath76",

    "provided that @xmath277 the energy range of possible transitions @xmath278 in the final nucleus is larger than in the target nucleus . in consequence , the relative effective weights @xmath279 in nucleus @xmath129 decline slower with increasing excitation energy and thus a larger range of levels contributes .",
    "this assumes similar spin structure in the two nuclei , of course , and the rule may not work at small @xmath280 when @xmath259 , @xmath279 are similar and the spin factors @xmath261 , @xmath281 dominate .",
    "the largest reaction @xmath94-values are encountered in capture reactions .",
    "for instance , neutron captures close to stability exhibit @xmath94-values of the order of @xmath282 mev , for highly proton - rich nuclei they can reach @xmath283 mev .",
    "similar values are found for proton captures around stability and on the neutron - rich side of the nuclear chart . in the light of the above it",
    "is not surprising that endothermic photodisintegration reactions exhibit very large @xmath228 of the order of several hundreds to thousands as illustrated in table  [ tab : photosefs ] .",
    "an exception to the above rule @xmath274 , however , has recently been discovered.@xcite although the effective weight @xmath284 may be slowly decreasing with increasing excitation energy @xmath104 of a level , the corresponding cross section @xmath105 may decrease much faster , even exponentially .",
    "this is because with increasing @xmath104 the relative interaction energy in that channel @xmath143 is reduced .",
    "if the cross section @xmath105 is strongly decreasing with decreasing energy  as it is the case in the presence of a coulomb barrier or at high relative angular momentum ",
    "transitions on excited states will cease to importantly contribute to the effective cross section even when being strongly weighted .",
    "this is the reason why charged particle reactions show only moderate values of @xmath255 at low @xmath41 even though their relevant energy window may be high above the reaction threshold .",
    "this , of course , acts in the entrance channel of a reaction as well as in its exit channel .    the point , however , is to realize that the barriers may be different in the two channels , leading to a different suppression of contributions .",
    "for instance , a ( n , p ) or ( n,@xmath0 ) reaction has a coulomb barrier only in the exit channel , ( p,@xmath0 ) reactions have different barriers in entrance and exit channel .",
    "this has the consequence that low - energy transitions in the exit channel of an exothermic reaction may be suppressed in such a manner as to yield @xmath285 . whether this is the case",
    "will strongly depend on the @xmath94-value because it determines the range of transition energies to be efficiently suppressed .",
    "the higher the barrier , the larger @xmath94-value is allowed while still permitting to suppress most transitions from excited states .",
    "the stellar temperature also plays a role but its impact is smaller .    a global search across the chart of nuclides for reactions exhibiting @xmath285",
    "was performed in refs .  .",
    "the study focused on identifying cases which are interesting for experiments by requiring @xmath286 and the stellar enhancement factors for forward and reverse reaction to differ by more than 10% . at stellar temperatures @xmath287 gk about 1200 reactions were found but not all of them are astrophysically interesting.@xcite figure  [ fig : qsupp ] shows the dependence of the @xmath94-values on the charge of the target nucleus of two types of reactions selected from the total set .",
    "the envelope from the maximal @xmath280 appearing for each type at each charge @xmath288 illustrates the action of the increasing coulomb barrier .",
    "it can be clearly seen that larger maximal @xmath289 is allowed with increasing charge @xmath288 .",
    "the increase with increasing charge is steeper for ( @xmath0,n ) reactions than for ( p , n ) reactions due to the higher coulomb barrier for @xmath0 particles .",
    "the scatter at a fixed charge number @xmath288 is due to the range of @xmath94-values found within an isotopic chain .    summarizing the above , comparing the position of the relevant energy window with the average level spacing in a nucleus already gives an estimate of the magnitude of the stellar enhancement to be expected . when measuring reaction cross sections for astrophysics it is desireable to perform the experiment in the reaction direction showing smallest @xmath255 in order to stay as close as possible to the actually required stellar cross section .",
    "this favored direction turns out to be the exothermic one in the vast majority of cases , i.e. , a reaction with positive @xmath94-value , with comparatively few exceptions ( compared to the total number of conceivable reactions ) as discussed above .",
    "it should be remembered that the reverse rate can always be calculated using the reciprocity relations ( [ eq : revrate ] ) and ( [ eq : revphoto ] ) . , appearing in ( [ eq : revrate ] ) , ( [ eq : revphoto ] ) , when @xmath290 . ]    finally , it is worth mentioning that similar considerations for the transformation of effective weights and deviations @xmath255 from the ground state values also apply to other types of reactions , not only the ones discussed here . for instance , also for electron captures and other reactions mediated by the weak interaction an effective cross section , effective weights , and relevant energy windows can be derived , applying the appropriate energy distributions .",
    "they may become more complicated , however , than the ones obtained for the mbd because an explicit dependence on the chemical potential is required in the general case .",
    "moreover , neutrinos are not in thermal equilibrium with nuclei and thus their temperature will enter as an additional parameter .",
    "the plasma temperature in the astrophysical sites where nuclear reactions occur is so high that the nuclei are fully ionized and embedded in a cloud of free electrons .",
    "this situation affects reactions and decays and has to be considered when preparing a rate to be used in astrophysical reaction networks .",
    "similar to the treatment of stellar enhancement factors , these corrections also have to be modeled theoretically and experimental rates have to be corrected for them . for completeness , some of the effects are discussed briefly without going into detail here .",
    "decays ( and electron captures ) are affected not only by the thermal excitation of the nucei as shown in ( [ eq : stelldecay ] ) but also by the electrons surrounding the nuclei . a nucleus in an atom",
    "can be converted by , e.g. , capture of an electron from the atomic k - shell . in the plasma ,",
    "electrons are captured from the electron cloud and this may alter the half - life of a nucleus considerably . a well - known example for this is the decay of @xmath291be .",
    "its lifetime under central solar conditions ( @xmath292 d ) is almost double the one under terrestrial , non - ionized conditions ( @xmath293 d ) .",
    "also the @xmath218 decay lifetimes are modified by a change in the electron emission probability .",
    "the plasma electrons reduce the phasespace available for emission to the continuum and thus increase @xmath294 . on the other hand , bound - state decay , i.e.  the placement of the emitted electron into a low - lying atomic shell , becomes possible even when it were forbidden in an atom because of the occupation of available electron shells .",
    "similar considerations apply to charged - current reactions with electron neutrinos .",
    "these effects act in addition to the alteration of the lifetimes through thermal excitation of the nucleus and depend on the plasma temperature , density , and composition , which may all affect the distribution of the electrons throughout the plasma .",
    "nuclear reactions with charged nuclei are affected by _",
    "electron screening_. electrons in the vicinity of the nucleus shield part of its charge and thus effectively lower its coulomb barrier .",
    "theoretical predictions of cross sections and rates always assume bare nuclei without any electrons and therefore have to be corrected for screening .",
    "the magnitude of the screening is strongly dependent on the temperature @xmath41 , density @xmath6 , and composition @xmath295 of the plasma . at high density",
    ", electron screening can increase the rate by several orders of magnitude and lead to _ pycnonuclear _ burning at much lower temperatures than otherwise needed to ignite nuclear burning .",
    "moreover , dynamical effects due to the fast movement of electrons may also play a role , although there is discussion on whether this is important when all reactants are in thermodynamic equilibrium.@xcite it is apparent that the theoretical treatment of screening is complicated and we are far from complete microscopic descriptions.@xcite the proper inclusion of screening effects remains a challenging problem in plasma physics .    under most conditions",
    ", the screened reactivity can be decomposed into the regular stellar reactivity and a screening factor@xcite @xmath296 this implies that the coulomb potential @xmath297 seen by the reaction partners can be described by the bare coulomb potential and an effective screening potential @xmath298 @xmath299 then the screening factor acquires the form @xmath300 .",
    "the challenge is in the determination of @xmath301 depending on the plasma conditions .    an often used static approximation , being appropriate for early burning stages of stars , is _ weak screening _ in the debye - hckel model.@xcite weak screening assumes that the average coulomb energy of each nucleus is much smaller than the thermal energy , i.e.  @xmath302 .",
    "then a nucleus will be surrounded by a polarized sphere of charges , with a radius @xmath303 with @xmath304 where the sum runs over all charged plasma components .",
    "the screening factor @xmath305 is transformed to @xmath306 with @xmath307 .    for _ strong screening _ in high density plasmas",
    "it is more appropriate to use the ion - sphere model instead of the debye - hckel approximation.@xcite the ion - sphere model is equivalent to the wigner - seitz model used in condensed matter theory .",
    "another type of screening is observed in nuclear experiments in the laboratory .",
    "there , nuclei are present in atoms , molecules , or metals , each with specific electron charge distributions around the nucleus .",
    "although completely different from plasma screening , this type of screening has to be understood because it is especially important at the low interaction energies of astrophysical relevance . the _ measured _ reaction cross sections have to be corrected to obtain the bare cross section which can be compared to theory or used to determine the rate .",
    "atomic screening can be treated in the adiabatic approximation , leading to @xmath308 with the sommerfeld parameter @xmath309 from ( [ eq : sommerfeld ] ) .",
    "the screening potential @xmath310 in this approximation is given by the difference in the electron binding energy of the target atom and the atom made from target atom plus projectile @xmath311 . in light systems ,",
    "the velocity of the atomic electrons is comparable to the relative motion between the nuclei .",
    "therefore a dynamical model is more appropriate.@xcite however , the adiabatic approximation provides an upper limit on the expected screening effect on the cross section .",
    "there seem to be discrepancies between theory and laboratory determinations of @xmath310 , the latter often yielding much larger values of @xmath310 .",
    "some of them have been resolved through improved stopping powers used in the determination of the experimental cross sections,@xcite while others remain puzzling , especially regarding cross sections of nuclei implanted in metals.@xcite thus , the laboratory screening seems to be less understood than the stellar screening .",
    "having discussed the special requirements of astrophysics for the determination of the stellar rates in the preceding sections , we turn to the question of how to obtain the cross sections @xmath312 required in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) , ( [ eq : csstar ] ) and ( [ eq : effcs ] ) at the energies of astrophysical relevance .",
    "it has become apparent that astrophysical rates include more transitions than usually obtained in straightforward laboratory reaction cross section measurements .",
    "cleverly designed experiments may study some of them but especially at larger stellar temperatures , as they are typical for explosive burning , theory will be indispensable for providing the appropriate _ stellar _ reaction rates . even at stability , the small cross sections of charged - particle reactions at astrophysically relevant energies ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : energies ] ) pose a considerable challenge for current measurements and future experiments have to employ novel techniques or new facilities to address this problem .",
    "moreover , hot astrophysical environments produce highly unstable nuclei which can not be studied in the laboratory , yet .",
    "reaction cross sections of nuclei far from stability at astrophysical energies probably will never be experimentally determined .",
    "therefore reaction networks for explosive nucleosynthesis have to include the majority of their reaction rates from theoretical predictions although experiments may help to determine nuclear properties and some of the transitions required for the calculation of effective cross sections .",
    "although reaction theory dates back as far as the 1950s , the special requirements of astrophysics and the need for cross section predictions of nuclei far from stability provide an interesting and stimulating environment for the application and further developments of different approaches .",
    "the challenges are manyfold . on one hand ,",
    "astrophysical energies are very low and , as we will see below , different reaction mechanisms may contribute or interfere .",
    "on the other hand , even if the reaction mechanism is unique and well understood , nuclear properties entering the reaction model have to be predicted for nuclei far off stability .",
    "this proves challenging even for modern nuclear structure calculations .",
    "although a fully microscopic treatment is preferrable , good parameterizations and averaged quantities are still necessary in many cases due to the sheer number of reactions and involved nuclei , especially for intermediate and heavy nuclei consisting of more than @xmath313 nucleons and thus not allowing the application of few - body models . finally , the interpretation of experiments has to be supported by theory .",
    "this latter case may involve different methods than the one dealing with the prediction of astrophysical rates because experiments may be conducted at higher energies and theory is needed to extract the information to be included in the rates.@xcite for example , the properties of excited states and their spectroscopic factors can be studied by ( d , p ) reactions at comparatively high energy which are not directly relevant in astrophysics . in",
    "the following i focus on theory for the prediction of astrophysical reaction rates .",
    "theoretical models can be roughly classified in three categories:@xcite    1 .",
    "models involving adjustable parameters , such as the @xmath314-matrix@xcite or the @xmath315-matrix@xcite methods ; parameters are fitted to the available experimental data and the cross sections are extrapolated down to astrophysical energies .",
    "these fitting procedures , of course , require the knowledge of data , which are sometimes too scarce for a reliable extrapolation .",
    "ab initio \" models , where the cross sections are determined from the wave functions of the system .",
    "the potential model@xcite , the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba)@xcite , and microscopic models@xcite are , in principle , independent of experimental data .",
    "more realistically , these models depend on some physical parameters , such as a nucleus - nucleus or a nucleon - nucleon interaction which can be reasonably determined from experiment only .",
    "the microscopic generator coordinate method ( gcm ) provides a  basic \" description of a nucleonic system , since the whole information is obtained from a nucleon - nucleon interaction . since this interaction is nearly the same for all light nuclei , the predictive power of the gcm is high for such nuclei .",
    "the above models can be used for low level - density nuclei only .",
    "this condition is fulfilled in most of the reactions involving light nuclei ( @xmath316 ) .",
    "however when the level density near threshold is large ( i.e. more than a few levels per mev ) , statistical models , using averaged optical transmission coefficients , are more suitable ( see sec .  [ sec : statmod ] ) .",
    "the nuclear level density ( nld ) at the compound nucleus excitation energy corresponding to the astrophysical energy window determines which reaction mechanism is applicable and which model to choose . the compound formation energy @xmath317 is given by the astrophysical energy @xmath76 relative to the ground state of the target nucleus and the separation energy of the projectile @xmath318 .",

    "resonances in reaction cross sections are important for the majority of nuclei .",
    "depending on the number of nucleons in the target nucleus resonances appear in the reaction cross section at lower or higher energy and their average spacing also depends on the structure of the nucleus .",
    "astrophysical energy windows cover regions of widely spaced , isolated resonances to regions of a large number of overlapping , unresolved resonances .",
    "accordingly , different approaches have to be combined .",
    "the latter region is more important for reactions between charged reactants because the coulomb barrier shifts the relevant energy window to higher energy compared to reactions where neutrons determining the location of the window ( see sec .",

    "the resonance properties ( resonance energy , spin , partial and total widths ) have to be known .",
    "often , an inverse approach is used and the resonance properties are derived from experimental data by , e.g. , @xmath314-matrix fits .",
    "where this is impossible , nuclear theory has to be invoked to predict the required quantities .",
    "this remains problematic , however , because the reaction cross sections are very sensitive to the resonance properties .",

    "the usual hauser - feshbach equations do not account for these fluctuations .",
    "therefore , a meaningful comparison to experimental data is only possible after averaging the data over a sufficiently wide energy range , comparable to the average resonance widths . when using the statistical model to compute astrophysical reaction rates ( or when deriving rates experimentally directly ) this is taken care of automatically .",
    "however , when using beams with a very narrow energy spread it should be noted that the results can not be directly compared to calculations.@xcite    it is worthwhile to point out that the reaction rate is rather `` forgiving '' to deviations around a `` true '' cross section value , provided the deviations go both ways and can cancel within the integration in ( [ eq : rate ] ) .",

[ sec : relevance ] .",

    "may barely reach the required high energy for additional processes , such as semi - direct reactions , this may not affect the reaction rates much .",
    "this is because they also include transitions from excited states according to ( [ eq : effrate ] ) and ( [ eq : effweights ] ) , which proceed at lower relative energy and thus remain unaffected by modifications of the cross sections at higher energy .",
    "the hfm assumes that the compound nucleus has sufficient time to distribute the energy gained through the interaction with the projectile among all nucleons of the compound system before it decays . at a high compound formation energy @xmath319 of several tens of mev transitions occurring before this energy - equilibration lead to multistep reactions and pre - equilibrium emission of particles and",
    "photons.@xcite the required compound excitation energy is too high to be of astrophysical relevance .",
    "the second type of modifications introduced above is discussed in the following , focussing on two ideas .",

    "it can be treated approximately by applying an iterative application of ( [ eq : hf ] ) , ( [ eq : tottrans ] ) , and ( [ eq : parttrans ] ) to transitions to states in each system formed in each emission process .",
    "this has been used , for example , for calculating neutrino - induced particle emission which is relevant to the construction of neutrino detectors.@xcite in such calculations , the formation transmission coefficients @xmath424 in ( [ eq : hf ] ) are replaced by neutrino transmission coefficients @xmath425 describing the population of compound states by neutrino interactions ( using , e.g. , the random phase approximation ) .",
    "neutrino reactions select high excitation energies and thus multi - particle emission will also be important at stability .",
    "the same approach can be used to determine @xmath27-delayed particle emission when @xmath27-decay produces a daughter nucleus in an excited state above a particle - separation energy .",
    "it can also be used to study @xmath27-delayed fission .",
    "both processes are important in the r - process.@xcite    the second idea revolves around the fact that regular hfm calculations assume a compound formation probability independent of the compound nld at the compound formation energy .",
    "therefore the sum in ( [ eq : cs ] ) runs over all @xmath426 pairs ( a high - spin cutoff is introduced in practical application of the model because spin values far removed from the spins appearing in the initial and final nuclei do not contribute significantly to the transmission coefficients ) .",
    "the availability of compound states and doorway states defines the applicability of the hfm.@xcite relying on an average over resonances , the hfm is not applicable with a low nld at compound formation .",
    "furthermore , not all spins and parities will be available with equal probability at each @xmath319 , especially at low nld .",
    "on average the hfm will then overpredict the resonant cross section ( unless single resonances dominate ) because it will overestimate the compound formation probability .",
    "this can be treated by introducing a modification of the formation cross section which includes the compound nld dependence .",
    "the summands of ( [ eq : cs ] ) will then be weighted according to the available number of states with the given @xmath426 .",
    "( formally this is the same as assuming @xmath426 dependent potentials for particle channels . ) in the most general case this will require a dependence on a @xmath426-dependent compound nucleus nld at @xmath319 . note that the standard hfm only includes the nld of the compound nucleus in the photon transmission coefficients ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : relevance ] ) to determine the endpoints of the @xmath82-transitions .",
    "the assumption that all spins and parities are available can be lifted in several steps .",

    "although the parities are not equidistributed up to sizeable excitation energies , the impact on _ stellar _ rates remains small ( in comparison to other uncertainties ) because the effective cross section ( [ eq : effcs ] ) also includes transitions from excited states which washes out the selectivity on parity .",

    "[ sec : relevance ] for further details .",
    "there are different ingredients required to calculate the hfm cross section with the formulas given in the preceding sections . which ingredients impact different parts of the calculation in what manner is discussed below , but how a change in the transmission coefficients ( of certain or all included transitions ) affects the resulting cross section",
    "can only be understood with the help of ( [ eq : cs ] ) .",
    "similar to the determination of the energy - dependence of the cross section ( which is crucial in the derivation of the relevant energy windows in sec .",
    "[ sec : energies ] ) , the sensitivity of the cross section and rate to a change in the nuclear properties of the participating nuclei depends on which transmission coefficient ( or averaged width ) actually affects the cross section while the others cancel from ( [ eq : cs ] ) . as already pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : energies ] , the discussion applies to both the bwf and the hfm .",
    "thus , the sensitivities are rather well known in certain parts of the experimental community studying resonances and in the field of nuclear data evaluation . since they do not seem to be so well known in nuclear astrophysics and their implications also have to be interpreted in terms of stellar cross sections and astrophysical reaction rates , it is helpful to outline briefly the main points here .    by comparison",
    "to ( [ eq : hf ] ) and ( [ eq : hfrate ] ) we find that ( [ eq : cs ] ) transforms to @xmath428 for each @xmath429-dependent summand . in laboratory cross sections ( usually with @xmath112 ) only few @xmath429-summands contribute due to the spin selection rules , and so the application of @xmath430 to determine the sensitivities to changes in the widths is straightforward .",
    "the situation is different for stellar rates and ratios @xmath431 because transitions from excited target states additionally contribute and more terms in the sum may be relevant , depending on the nucleus and the plasma temperature .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath410 includes @xmath432 in both cases . depending on whether the average entrance transmission @xmath433 significantly defines the size of @xmath432 , a variation of the entrance transmission will affect the total transmission more or less",
    "this can lead to a different sensitivity of laboratory cross sections to the entrance channel than to the transmission in the exit channel , even if everything else is comparable .",
    "the interpretation of experimental results concerning the impact on stellar rates has also to proceed carefully .",
    "for example , if a strong dependence is found on the entrance transmission coefficient and some deficiencies when comparing the model to experimental data , this does not necessarily mean that this is of relevance to the astrophysical rate . or",
    "strength functions @xmath434 can be determined experimentally , it is more useful to obtain the latter because they are directly proportional to the transmission coefficients @xmath381 without an additional dependence on the compound nld.@xcite ] since the astrophysical rate involves @xmath432 also in the numerator , it may more often cancel with the denominator , even if it would not for @xmath433 in the numerator . only for rates with low sef @xmath435 .",
    "this shows again that stellar rates and laboratory cross sections do not have a one - to - one correspondence and additional , mostly theoretical considerations have to be included",
    ".    several special cases can appear in ( [ eq : fraction ] ) : ( i ) the larger of the two transmissions in the denominator also dominates the numerator ; then the cross section or rate will change similarly to a change of the smaller transmission coefficient in the numerator and be oblivious to any others ; ( ii ) three channels will be important when neither of the transmission coefficients in the numerator dominates the total transmission ; then any change in the two transmissions in the numerator will be translated into an equal change in the cross section but a change in the one determining the denominator will result in an inverse proportional change in the cross section . in the general case when @xmath410 is not dominated by a single channel",
    "the situation is more complicated as any change in a transmission coefficient will not fully affect the cross section at a similar level .",
    "a helpful visual aid to estimate the relative importance of the different channels is a sensitivity plot .",
    "i define the sensitivity @xmath436 as a measure of a change in the cross section @xmath437 as the result of a change in a transmission coefficient ( or width ) by the factor @xmath438 , with @xmath439 when no change occurs and @xmath440 when the cross section changes by the same factor as the transmission coefficient ( or width ) : @xmath441 plotting @xmath436 as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy yields a plot like the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensi ] for the reaction @xmath442ru(p,@xmath82)@xmath443rh .",

    "[ fig : sensi ] that the sensitivities are very different at lower and higher energies .",
    "for example , a measurement closely below the neutron threshold would be in a region where @xmath436 is largest for the @xmath82 transmission coefficient ( or width ) but smallest for the proton transmission , just the opposite of what is found in the astrophysically relevant energy region . above the neutron",
    "threshold the situation is even more complicated because there is additional sensitivity to the neutron channel ( dominating @xmath446 ) , although not as large as to @xmath447 . if any discrepancy between measured and predicted cross sections was found , it would be hard to disentangle the different contributions .",
    "in this example , no information on the astrophysically important proton transmission coefficient can be extracted from a measurement at higher energies .",
    "the above example also shows that some of the standard assumptions usually used in nuclear physics experiments do not apply .",
    "for instance , it is usually assumed that the @xmath448width is always smaller than particle widths and therefore a capture reaction will always only be sensitive to the @xmath448width .",
    "many , if not most , astrophysical reactions with charged particles , however , proceed close to or below the coulomb barrier .",
    "this leads to very narrow charged particle widths and they may well become smaller than the @xmath448widths . even neutron widths close to a neutron threshold become smaller than photon widths ( which are relatively independent of energy compared to the particle widths ) . therefore it is always important to closely inspect the widths and to perform a thorough sensitivity study when investigating the astrophysical impacts of changes in the hfm inputs .    from the general considerations above it also follows that it is advantageous to use reactions with neutrons in one channel for investigating the sensitivity to the charged - particle optical potential , i.e. , using ( @xmath0,n ) , ( n,@xmath0 ) , ( p , n ) , or ( n , p ) reactions . except within a few kev above the neutron threshold",
    ", the neutron width will always be much larger than the charged - particle width , even at higher than astrophysical energies .",
    "therefore it will cancel with the denominator in eq .   and leave the pure energy dependence of the charged - particle width . on the other hand",
    ", the neutron channel may not be open at the energies required to study the astrophysically important charged particle width and extrapolations have to be performed .",
    "furthermore , this shows that it is difficult to obtain information on the neutron potential from reactions .",
    "but this also implies that the sensitivity of astrophysical rates to the neutron optical potential is not high .",
    "nuclear properties and how they affect the calculation of transmission coefficients ( or averaged widths ) are briefly discussed in the following .",
    "this is by no means meant to be an exhaustive listing and discussion but rather some exemplary points are taken to explain the special requirements in the calculation of astrophysical rates and to point out the challenges .",
    "further information on the nuclear input used in statistical model calculations for nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics can be found , e.g. , in refs .   and references therein .",
    "while the hfm has been used extensively to study reaction data , its application in nuclear astrophysics has a slightly different focus .",
    "standard nuclear physics investigations use the hfm by including measured or known properties of nuclei .",

    "stellar cross sections not only require the modification of the hfm shown above but also the inclusion of mostly unknown further input because the reactions proceed at much lower energy and/or involve unstable nuclei .",

    "the fission transmission coefficient is calculated from the penetration probability through a fission barrier . since most of the astrophysical fission occurs at energies below or close above the barrier , the resulting rates are very sensitive to the height and width of the fission barrier .",

    "nuclear physicists working at the boundary to astrophysics have to be aware of these special requirements and it is one of the aims of this work to having outlined a number of them .",
    "a further noteable fact is that it is necessary to not only point out special effects or important possible improvements but to actually apply them across the nuclear chart and produce large - scale sets of reaction rates which can be readily used by astrophysicists .",
    "this implies that they are made accessible in a form suitable to be implemented in astrophysical models .",
    "it should not be forgotten that the other essential aspect of nuclear astrophysics is the astrophysical modeling using reaction networks . only in conjunction with this part of the field progress",
    "can be made .",
    "the models set the stage and define the ranges of conditions within which nuclear processes occur .",
    "nevertheless , it can be treacherous to rely too strongly on a certain model .",
    "reliable nuclear models and astrophysical reaction rates should cover a large range of possibilities and provide a sound base for pinpointing the sites of nucleosynthesis processes or even for discovering new types of nucleosynthesis in different astrophysical models .",
    "moreover , the modifications of the cross sections and rates in a stellar plasma are an interesting topic in itself and warrant an independent study even without connection to a specific astrophysical site .",
    "the prediction of astrophysical reaction rates takes nuclear physics in a new direction and tests nuclear theory at the limits . due to the finite number of nuclei",
    ", however , this is a finite task .",
    "this is also why parameterizations or phenomenological models may still have their justification , if designed in an appropriate manner .",
    "we do not have to extrapolate to infinity but within rather limited ranges of nucleon numbers .",
    "it is reassuring that the overall abundance distributions obtained by combining several postulated nucleosynthesis processes are already closely resembling what we find in nature , even when explosive events and highly unstable nuclei are involved .",
    "this tells us that the most important properties seem to be described acceptably well .",
    "there are remarkable exceptions , however , both in explaining abundance distributions ( e.g. , of the p - nuclei , the light s - process elements , isotopic anomalies in meteorites , the heaviest nuclei at the endpoint of the r - process , and many more ) and in assigning astrophysical sites ( e.g. , to the r - process , probably also to parts of the p - process ) . a detailed understanding and reliable reaction rates are also essential for using nuclear cosmochronometry to determine astronomical timescales .",
    "to go beyond previous estimates and reach a new level of detail , however , requires a large , dedicated effort of both experiment and theory .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation , grant 200020 - 105328 , and by the european commission within the ensar / thexo project .",
