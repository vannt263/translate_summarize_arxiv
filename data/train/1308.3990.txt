    "one critical requirement for employing the above relations is an accurate determination of the effective temperature . to accomplish this we make use of the infrared flux method ( irfm ) , originally developed to determined angular diameters with high accuracy ( ( *",
    "* blackwell & shallis ( 1977 ) ) ) .",
    "briefly , the irfm aims at simultaneously recovering the bolometric and infrared monochromatic flux of a star measured at the top of earth s atmosphere , and compare them to the same theoretical quantities .",
    "this reduces to a proper derivation of stellar fluxes , which in turns results in a determination of @xmath7 and therefore also in the angular diameter .    as the irfm requires a value of stellar gravity to determine @xmath7 ,",

    "as a first validation of the asteroseismic radii and angular diameters determined , we considered a sample of 22 _ kepler _ targets in the main - sequence and subgiant phase . these were selected because they have solid detections of solar - like oscillations , as well as parallaxes measurements accurate to better than 10% . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the comparison of our distance determinations with those from parallaxes .",
    "there is an excellent level of agreement between both determinations , with a weighted mean difference in the results below the 3% level .",

    "the agreement with independent measurements of parallaxes and interferometric angular diameters gives us confidence that asteroseismic determinations of stellar parameters can be accurate in radius and therefore distance to a level better than 5% .",

    ".  [ fig2 ] the histograms of mass and radius distributions are shown , revealing a slight excess of low - mass stars in the center direction compared to the anti - center results .",
    "since the center observations encompassed stars at lower galactic latitudes , the authors interpret this result as a vertical gradient in the mass distribution ( and thus age ) in the galactic disk .",
    "[ fig2 ]    a natural step to follow in this line of research is to determine accurate ages for these stars .",
    "unfortunately in the case of red giants , using only the scaling relations provides ages with uncertainties of the order of 30 - 40% ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* bedding et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) ) .",
    "unfortunately this information is not always readily available for all giants with detected oscillations , and other means of calibrating the scaling relations for ages of evolved stars must be employed .    in this respect , and considering that ages of red giants are mostly determined by their main - sequence lifetime , accurate determination of asteroseismic ages for unevolved stars can provide a sound base for calibrating the red giant phase . in the case of main - sequence pulsators , techniques relying on individual frequencies of oscillations have been widely studied and can set stricter constraints on ages .",
    "since 1-d stellar models poorly reproduce the outer layers of stars , it is useful to consider combinations of frequencies that eliminate the contribution of these regions .",

    "* silva aguirre et al . ( 2013 ) ) performed a detailed study of two _ kepler _ targets with accurate individual oscillations frequencies available . using four different evolutionary codes coupled to three oscillation codes , the authors modelled the two targets and determined the stellar parameters by fitting the ratios @xmath14 and @xmath15 as depicted in fig .",
    "their results show that radii , masses , and ages of main - sequence field stars can be determined by this technique with a precision of @xmath81.5% , @xmath84% , and @xmath810% , respectively .",
    "we have shown that asteroseismic scaling relations , coupled to photometric determinations of stellar temperature and metallicity , can yield sets of accurate stellar parameters for field stars .",
    "a particularly interesting product of this technique is the determination of distances to stars , that allow us to dissect the galactic disk and study its different components .",
    "using red giants in different fields of the galaxy , asteroseismic analysis reveals a mass gradient as a function of galactic latitude in the milky way disk .",
    "this is interpreted as evidence of an age gradient that provides another constrain for models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "although ages for red giants remain to be determined once information on the evolutionary state is available from seismology , calibrations of the techniques can be achieved using main - sequence oscillators as a benchmark . in this context , we have shown that detailed analysis using frequency combinations can result in ages of field stars precise to a level of @xmath810% . the asteroseismic revolution pioneered by the corot and _",
