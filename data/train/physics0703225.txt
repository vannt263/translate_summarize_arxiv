    "the markov chain monte carlo algorithms @xcite sample a configuration or phase space by means of an ergodic markov chain that leaves the equilibrium distribution invariant . except for a few remarkable exceptions , such as swendsen and wang s cluster algorithm and follow - ups @xcite ,",
    "the chain s transition matrix is constructed by means of the rejection technique , according to the metropolis - hastings prescription . typically , the ensuing markov chains are local in nature . in the limit of small displacements ( nearest - neighbor moves on a lattice ) ,",
    "the generated stochastic dynamics becomes an activated diffusive process , akin to the smoluchowski dynamics .",
    "for such dynamics , the rate of equilibration is controlled by the mean escape times from the dominant basins , which times are proportional to @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the inverse temperature and @xmath7 being the energy barrier .",
    "the transition state theory can provide more accurate estimates , which involve free energy barriers .    to attenuate the negative influence of the energetic barriers , one may attempt to alter the sampled distribution by means of carefully - chosen weighting factors , as is the purpose of umbrella sampling @xcite and multicanonical ensembles @xcite . if such modifications are not what is desired , the mixing times can be improved by attempting larger jumps , ideally , directly through a barrier .",
    "however , examples of truly global algorithms are few and their existence depends on specific properties of the systems that are investigated .",
    "general - purpose algorithms that achieve non - locality , such as , j - walking @xcite , simulated tempering @xcite , or replica exchange @xcite , do so by means of extending the dimensionality of the system , therefore , introducing new parameters that provide alternative communication routes . in the enlarged space ,",
    "the algorithms remain local , making the following question pertinent to the design of algorithms : what determines the size of the jumps ? in this paper",
    ", we provide the answer in the form of an entropic mismatch between the distribution that is sampled and the trial distribution utilized in the construction of the monte carlo transition matrix .    for standard random walk metropolis samplers , numerical observations evidencing",
    "the entropic nature of the displacement - limiting factors exist in the form of experimental knowledge that updating many particles simultaneously results in a decrease of the average displacements . nevertheless , somewhat at odds with the observed dimensional sensitivity",
    ", the standard justification for the decrease has been that the likelihood that the particles collide is increased .",
    "owing to the ensuing increase in the energy , high - dimensional moves are more likely to be rejected .",
    "it was recently realized that this explanation is erroneous and that the influence of the dimensionality on the efficiency of samplers is an entropic effect @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that the effect features a behavior similar to that predicted for systems made up of independent particles , which particles can not collide . in the original work , the effect has not been properly quantified .",
    "given the importance of the rejection - based monte carlo algorithms in the physical sciences , the author feels that a proper analysis is desirable .",

    "the present study allows us to make several general recommendations on the design of algorithms .",
    "we begin by considering the case of a single - particle sampling strategy .",
    "the approach can be regarded as a monte carlo implementation of a gibbs sampler @xcite .",
    "the latter is an idealized technique whereby the new coordinates for a particle are proposed directly from the conditional distribution of the particle . obviously , a gibbs sampler has a built - in correlation that sets a limit on the performance of metropolis algorithms that update only a few variables at a time .",
    "as such , we can not indefinitely improve the efficiency of the algorithms by increasing the average displacements for the trial distribution .",
    "for example , in the case of a lennard - jones cluster , a particle essentially moves in a cage created by its environment .",
    "even if we sample independently from the conditional distribution of the particle , we still propose moves mostly in this cage , which is the statistically important region .",
    "the evolution of the heat capacity profiles is similar to that from fig .  1 of ref .  .",
    "each of the six curves has been obtained by collecting averages for groups of @xmath214 million steps .",
    "early in the simulation , the heat capacity develops a fake maximum , which is subsequently transformed in a `` shoulder . ''",
    "the last four curves fluctuate around this shoulder , with the fluctuations providing an estimate for the errors .",
    ", width=321 ]    coping with the gibbs correlation requires updating more than one particle at a time . to set things in perspective , in the limit that all particles are updated and",
    "that the displacements are comparable with the size of the cluster , the sampling becomes almost independent .",
    "unfortunately , by comparison with the monte carlo gibbs - like sampler described in the preceding paragraph , the displacements are further decreased by the entropic effects . in the limit of small displacements ,",
    "the metropolis sampler is essentially diffusive .",
    "consequently , if the decrease in the displacements is @xmath215 , we will roughly need @xmath216 steps to cover distances comparable to those for a gibbs - like sampler .    despite its intrinsically local nature ,",
    "an all - particle metropolis sampler can be more efficient than a gibbs sampler if the paths followed by the latter involve energetic barriers that are significantly larger than those characteristic of paths close to the minimum energy path .",
    "the latter paths are available to an all - atom sampler and more so to the smart monte carlo method , whereas a gibbs sampler may have little choice in effectuating a rare transition other than placing the particles successively on the edges of the conditional cages . in case of high cooperativeness for the minimum energy path @xcite , a large number of particles must be correctly positioned in order to cause a successful transition .",
    "unfortunately , the transition probability is exponentially decreasing with the aforementioned number of particles , because probabilities for individual particles multiply .",
    "which strategy must be utilized depends also on the computational cost to implement a given step . for general potentials , there might be the case that updating a single particle costs the same as updating all particles .",
    "if this is true , then it seems more advantageous to utilize the all - particle metropolis algorithm .",
    "indeed , we need @xmath1 calls to the potential function to defeat the entropic effects and span reasonable distances .",
    "the gibbs - like sampler makes @xmath1 calls to the potential function to complete a sweep",
    ". however , the first technique is in principle not limited by the formation of cages .",
    "nevertheless , in practice , the situation is more complicated because updating a single particle rarely requires a full evaluation of the potential .",
    "for example , a lennard - jones system can be updated one particle at a time in such a way that the cost for a complete sweep is twice the cost for an all - particle move .",
    "the gain in computational efficiency is large enough that the monte carlo implementation of the gibbs sampler is the default sampler for lennard - jones clusters or liquids . owing to its superiority in dealing with the entropic effects ,",
    "the smart monte carlo method is a good candidate for sampling subsystems containing tens or hundreds of atoms .    to summarize ,",
    "the ideal sampling strategy would divide the system in small subsystems ( which may overlap ) in a way that optimally compromises on the following requirements : i ) the correlation between the subsystems be as small as possible and ii ) the dimensionality of each subsystem be as small as possible .",
    "an efficient implementation may require the utilization of variables other than cartesian ones , as the subsystems may become nearly uncorrelated in such coordinates .",
    "each subsystem , which is described by strongly correlated degrees of freedom , is sampled utilizing an all - particle strategy or the smart monte carlo method , if forces are easily computable . finally ,",
    "if techniques of reducing the dimensionality of the system are not available , then the designer should introduce tuning parameters that can arbitrarily increase the similarity between the direct and reverse sampling distributions . a case",
    "is constituted by the replica - exchange techniques .",
    "if tuning parameters are not provided , then one unavoidably ends up with an algorithm that suddenly stops working for systems of sufficiently large dimensionality , owing to the severe exponential decay in the acceptance probability .",
    "the present study seems to favor coarse - graining and constrained - sampling as techniques capable of dealing with the negative impact of the dimensionality on the maximal displacements .",
    "such approaches reduce the effective dimensionality to that of the space of coarse variables , ideally described by their marginal distributions , or to that of the manifold defined by the set of constraints .",
    "resolution exchange @xcite can restore exactness in the first case , while at the same time improve the rare - event statistics , owing to the superior computational performance for the coarser levels of resolution . in this context",
    ", it appears that the estimators for the average acceptance probabilities derived here may prove useful in determining with reliability the degree of overlap between replicas of different resolutions .    finally , on a separate topic , the influence of dimensionality on the global properties of molecular dynamics integrators is an issue that has to be more carefully investigated . as kennedy and pendleton",
    "have shown , hybrid monte carlo , albeit guaranteeing exactness by means of detailed balance , requires time steps that decrease as a fractional power with the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the cause is precisely the entropic divergence documented here , this time between the phase - space boltzmann distributions of the true and shadow hamiltonians . thinking that systems of @xmath217 degrees of freedom are typical nowadays",
    ", a decrease in the time step by a factor of @xmath205 is not trivial .",
    "however , more worrisome seems to be the reverse scenario , where hybrid monte carlo is not utilized .",
    "it is not at all clear whether or not the extensive entropic divergence may lead to differences between the exact and the integrator s statistics of such a nature that the validity of the latter as an approximation becomes questionable .",
    "such a scenario could happen if the energy error is not equally divided between the degrees of freedom , and instead is transferred in an unfavorable way to crucial low - dimensional subsystems .",

    "<S> the efficiency of monte carlo samplers is dictated not only by energetic effects , such as large barriers , but also by entropic effects that are due to the sheer volume that is sampled . </S>",
    "<S> the latter effects appear in the form of an entropic mismatch or divergence between the direct and reverse trial moves . </S>",
    "<S> we provide lower and upper bounds for the average acceptance probability in terms of the rnyi divergence of order @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the asymptotic finitude of the entropic divergence is the necessary and sufficient condition for non - vanishing acceptance probabilities in the limit of large dimension . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we demonstrate that the upper bound is reasonably tight by showing that the exponent is asymptotically exact for systems made up of a large number of independent and identically distributed subsystems . for the last statement , we provide an alternative proof that relies on the reformulation of the acceptance probability as a large deviation problem . </S>",
    "<S> the reformulation also leads to a class of low - variance estimators for strongly asymmetric distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the entropy divergence causes a decay in the average displacements with the number of dimensions @xmath1 that are simultaneously updated . for systems that have a well - defined thermodynamic limit , the decay is demonstrated to be @xmath2 for random - walk monte carlo and @xmath3 for smart monte carlo ( smc ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of the @xmath4 cluster show that smc is virtually as efficient as the markov chain implementation of the gibbs sampler , which is normally utilized for lennard - jones clusters . </S>",
    "<S> an application of the entropic inequalities to the parallel tempering method demonstrates that the number of replicas increases as the square root of the heat capacity of the system . </S>"
