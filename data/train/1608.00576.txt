    "the first rr  lyrae star pulsating simultaneously in two radial modes ( an rrd star )  aq leonis  was identified by @xcite . for years",
    ", rrd stars have been considered as pure radial pulsators , with no peculiar behaviors like non - radial oscillations or blazhko effect .",
    "this simple picture has changed in recent years with the advent of space - based and massive ground - based photometry .",
    "observations from the space telescopes  most , corot , and kepler ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively )  led to the discovery of additional non - radial modes in rrd variables .",
    "similar detections were also done in the ground - based photometry @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for the most recent summary ( their table 4 ) and @xcite for the theoretical model explaining the excitation of non - radial modes in rr lyrae stars .",
    "nowadays , the number of known rrd stars reaches several thousands and most of them have been discovered in the time - series photometric databases obtained by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) .",
    "the large ( lmc ) and small magellanic clouds ( smc ) host particularly rich populations of double - mode rr  lyrae stars .",
    "the latest release of the ogle collection of variable stars @xcite contains in total 2624 double - mode rr  lyrae stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "rrd stars constitute about 5% and 10% of all rr  lyrae variables in the lmc and smc , respectively . in turn , in the central regions of the milky way the rate of double - mode rr  lyrae is below 0.5% of the entire sample @xcite .",
    "double - mode rr  lyrae variables occupy a limited region in the petersen diagram in which the ratios of the first - overtone to fundamental - mode periods ( @xmath0 ) are plotted against the logarithm of the fundamental - mode period ( @xmath7 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pet ] we present petersen diagrams for rrd stars in four environments : lmc , smc @xcite , galactic bulge @xcite , and globular cluster m3 @xcite . most of the rrd stars form a curved sequence continuing over a narrow range of period ratios @xmath8 .",
    "the only known exception to this rule is the galactic bulge , where rrd variables form a sequence reaching the period ratios as small as 0.726 , which can be explained by a high metal abundance in these stars @xcite .    in many environments",
    ", a number of double - mode rr  lyrae stars lies below or above the curved sequence in the petersen diagram .",
    "the first rrd stars showing the blazhko effect ( quasi - periodic modulations of pulsation amplitudes and/or phases ) were found just among these outliers in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "the same feature was discovered by @xcite for four rrd stars in the globular cluster m3 .",
    "it seems that blazhko rrd stars avoid the sequence delineated by regular rrd variables in the petersen diagram ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pet ] ) .    in this paper , we report the discovery of a group of 22 double - mode rr  lyrae stars in the magellanic cloud .",
    "our variables have period ratios within the range @xmath9  considerably lower than observed in the `` classical '' rrd stars in these galaxies .",
    "we show that both classes of double - mode pulsators present distinct features , like amplitude ratios , shapes of the light curves , presence of the blazhko effect , and the spatial distribution on the sky .",
    "we call the newly identified variables `` anomalous rrd stars '' .",
    "the sample of anomalous rrd stars has been extracted from the ogle collection of @xmath10 rr  lyrae variables in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "each light curve was searched for secondary periodicities and , as a result , more than 2600 `` classical '' rrd stars have been identified .",
    "moreover , five rr  lyrae stars with superimposed eclipsing variability and a number of other multi - periodic variables were found . in the latter group we noticed 22 ( 20 in the lmc and 2 in the smc ) double - mode rr  lyrae stars located just below `` classical '' rrd stars in the petersen diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pet ] , top panels ) . with the longer periods ranged between 0.45  d and 0.55  d and the period ratios between 0.725 and 0.738 , these stars distinctly cluster in this region of the petersen diagram , but they do not form a continuous structure with typical rrd stars .        in the first place",
    ", we ensured that our nonstandard double - periodic variables are rr  lyrae stars . among radially pulsating stars in the magellanic clouds ,",
    "double- or triple - mode classical cepheids may have periods around 0.5  d ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but generally they are brighter than rr  lyrae stars with the same periods .",
    "anomalous cepheids are fainter than classical cepheids @xcite , but these stars are exclusively single - mode pulsators . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] , we plot period ",
    "luminosity diagram ( where as a luminosity we use the extinction - independent wesenheit index , defined as @xmath11 ) , for rr  lyrae stars in the lmc and smc .",
    "both modes of the anomalous double - mode variables are overplotted with large yellow circles .",
    "also the fits to the period  luminosity relations for classical and anomalous cepheids are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl ] .",
    "one can see that our double - mode stars lie exactly on the period  luminosity relations followed by fundamental - mode ( rrab ) and first - overtone ( rrc ) rr  lyrae stars .",
    "classical and anomalous cepheids are much brighter than rr  lyrae stars with the same periods .",
    "the @xmath12 colours of our variables are practically the same as for typical rrd stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "only one star in the lmc is highly reddened by the interstellar extinction and one object in the smc seems to be slightly bluer and fainter than typical double - mode rr  lyrae stars , but still in the range occupied by rr  lyrae stars .",
    "we conclude that our targets must be rr  lyrae stars or , at least , are photometrically indistinguishable from rr  lyrae stars .",
    "the positions of these objects in the period  luminosity diagram show that they have fundamental and first - overtone radial modes simultaneously excited .",
    "positions of our anomalous rrd stars in the sky are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] . for comparison , in the bottom panels we plot the distributions of metal poor ( @xmath13}<-1.8 $ ] ) and metal rich ( @xmath13}>-0.7 $ ] ) rrab stars .",
    "the metallicities were derived using the photometric method developed by @xcite and calibrated to the @xmath14 band by @xcite .",
    "the anomalous rrd stars tend to cluster towards the center of the lmc , confirming their genuine lmc membership and indicating likely higher metallicity and younger population ( see later in the discussion ) .",
    "we note that metallicity determination for anomalous rrd stars using the @xcite method is not possible , due to the anomalous shape of the light curves , as we describe in more detail below .",
    "the basic properties of the anomalous rrd stars are collected in tab .",
    "[ tab : basics ] .",
    "these are : periods of the two pulsation modes , period ratio , amplitude of the fundamental mode , amplitude ratio , and mean @xmath14 and @xmath15 band magnitudes .",
    "the complete solution of the light curve decomposition is provided in the appendix available in the on - line version of the journal .",
    "tables a1-a22 contain identifications of all detected frequencies , their values , amplitudes and phases , all with standard errors . because the vast majority of the ogle observations have been obtained in the _ i _ photometric band , our analysis is based on the light curves in this passband . between march 2010 and july 2015 ogle",
    "collected from about 200 to nearly 750 _",
    "i_-band data points per star .",
    "a median uncertainty of individual photometric measurements for stars as faint as rr lyrae variables in the magellanic clouds is about 0.04  mag .",
    "anomalous rrd stars differ from normal rrd variables not only by the @xmath16 period ratios .",
    "the first striking difference is the amplitude ratios of both modes . in the bulk of typical rrd stars ,",
    "the first overtone is the dominant pulsation mode . in anomalous rrd stars in the magellanic clouds ,",
    "the fundamental mode has larger amplitude than the overtone mode in all but three variables ."
