    "in a recent work @xcite suggested that the extreme runaway star hd  271791 was polluted by gas from a core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) . the observed",
    "enrichment indicates that hd  271791 had been ejected by a sn explosion of a very massive compact primary , probably a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star . to avoid engulfment during the giant phase of the ccsn progenitor",
    ", the polluted star can not be too close to the ccsn . hence , to intercept a large fraction of the newly synthesized elements in the ccsn",
    ", the companion should be a giant .",
    "we here study some aspects of the evolution of such binary systems .",
    "we set aside the question whether the ccsn ejecta actually removes a large part of the giant , and no pollution occurs , as claimed by @xcite .    such a pollution might account for the presence of rare stars with peculiar abundances , e.g. , hv2112 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the evolved star hv2112 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) to have peculiar abundances .",
    "they suggested that the star is a red supergiant ( rsg ) star , and that the peculiar abundances can be understood if hv2112 is a thorne - ytkow object ( tzo ) .",
    "tzos are rsg stars that have a neutron star ( ns ) at their center @xcite .",
    "the star is powered by accretion on to the ns and/or by nuclear burning in a region away from the ns .",
    "the most likely formation scenario for a tzo in this case is a ns that in - spiraled inside the envelope of a rsg star , down to the core .",
    "the ns then destroyed the core and replaced the core as the central dense object .",
    "part of the destroyed core formed a temporary accretion disk around the ns .",
    "@xcite examined whether hv2112 is a tzo or perhaps a super asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) star .",
    "sagb stars are stars with a typical initial mass range of @xmath2 ( with dependence on the convective overshoot treatment ; ) with an oxygen / neon core undergoing thermal pulses with third dredge up .",
    "@xcite argued that sagbs can synthesize most of the elements that are used to claim that hv2112 is a tzo through s - process , e.g. , molybdenum , rubidium , and lithium .",
    "however , they found no way for a sagb star to synthesize calcium .",
    "they suggested that the observed high calcium abundance can be attributed to its synthesis in the temporary accretion disk around the ns , composed of the destroyed core material in the tzo formation process .",
    "in such an accretion disk temperatures and densities are high enough for calcium nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy of the disk wind that is required to spread calcium in the giant has enough energy to unbind the envelope , and thus @xcite postulated that the outflow is collimated , hence most of it escapes from the star .",
    "however , it is not clear that a tzo can form at all .",
    "based on earlier studies of common envelope ( ce ) ejection by jets @xcite , @xcite studied the removal of the ce that supposedly leads to the formation of tzos .",
    "@xcite found that the jets are launched by the accretion disk while the ns is still in a keplerian orbit around the central part of the core that is still intact .",
    "therefore , they argued , the jets are not well collimated , and the envelope and a large part of the core will be ejected .",
    "@xcite speculated that the calcium in hv2112 comes from an explosion of a supernova ( sn ) while hv2112 was already a giant star , hence could intercept a large fraction of the sn ejecta .",
    "the exploding star was just slightly more massive than hv2112 when they both were on the main sequence .",
    "in such massive binary systems the lighter star expands to become a giant before the more massive star explodes .    in the present paper",
    "we examine in more detail the scenario proposed by @xcite . in this sn - polluted giant ( snpg )",
    "scenario we specifically study binary systems of two stars that are massive , @xmath3 , and are very close in initial masses , @xmath4 .",
    "the sn explosion of the primary star might pollute the secondary if the two stars are not too far apart .",
    "the secondary stars on the more massive end of this range will result in rsg stars with enhanced newly synthesized elements , whereas those at the lower end would become polluted sagbs .",
    "therefore , we also examine a sub - group of binaries where the secondary also qualifies as a sagb star , @xmath5 , and examine the ejecta fraction that might be intercepted by the secondary star .",
    "in section [ sec : evolution ] we study the binary evolution of such systems . in section [ sec : hv2112 ] we discuss a sub - group of such systems and propose a possible explanation for the calcium enrichment in hv2112 . in section [ sec : br ] we estimate the birthrate of such systems .",
    "our summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we examine the evolution of massive binary systems where on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) the primary of mass @xmath6 is slightly more massive than the secondary of mass @xmath7 , as schematically presented in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] .",
    "we are interested in primary stars that end as ccsne , which implies an initial primary mass of @xmath8 . to intercept a large fraction of the newly synthesized elements in the ccsn of the progenitor",
    ", the companion should be a an evolved giant while the explosion of the primary takes place ( third row in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] ) .",

    ", is slightly larger than that of the secondary ( blue ) , @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution is plotted from zams ( row 1 ) until the primary star explodes as a core collapse supernova ( ccsn ) ( row 3 ) . during the explosion the primary",
    "chemically pollutes the red super giant ( rsg ) secondary star which then becomes a sn - polluted giant ( snpg ) ( row 4 ) .",
    "roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) is possible once the primary is a red giant branch ( rgb ) star ( row 2 ) .",
    "this is possible for an initial separation of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the maximum radius of the primary during its rgb phase . in such cases the post - transfer secondary star , @xmath13 ,",
    "is the more massive star in the system since the two stars are of close initial masses ( row 3 ) . since this possible early mass transfer episode",
    "does not influence much the final snpg outcome , we do not study it here in much detail . the resulting secondary star will be a super asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) star in case its initial mass is @xmath14 . , width=302 ]",
    "the initial orbital separation can not be too small since we must avoid the possibility that the secondary would be engulfed by the primary during the primary giant phase .",
    "yet we point out that for the case of close binaries it is possible for the primary to fill its roche lobe during its red giant branch ( rgb ) phase and transfer some of its outer envelope to its less massive companion ( second row of fig .[fig : mech ] ) .",
    "we find that for our close systems @xmath15 rlof occurs for @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the maximum radius of the primary on the rgb .",
    "hence , assuming the initial orbital separation of the system is @xmath18 , the primary might fill its roche lobe and transfer the outer layers of its envelope to the secondary star , while the latter is still on the ms . due to the close initial mass of the stars , in case of mass transfer the post - transfer primary continues to evolve with a lower mass envelope , and the post - transfer ( pt ) secondary evolves as a star slightly more massive than the initial primary , @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , since the stars are of close initial masses , as the the secondary grows to be the more massive star in the system the orbital separation grows and the mass transfer might cease , at least for some period .",
    "we do not go into details of such an early - rlof phase since it has little importance to the pollution of the secondary and the snpg outcome .",
    "in addition , it is possible that later the secondary will fill its roche lobe before the primary explodes .",
    "if this occurs we might form a common envelope .",
    "this is not studied here .    the evolutionary scheme presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] is significantly different from those in @xcite as here there is no reverse evolution , the primary experiences a ccsn explosion , and the secondary is a giant when the primary ends its evolution ; these do nt hold in the scenarios discussed in @xcite .    to follow the evolution of each star from zero age main sequence ( zams ) we use the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) , version 7184 @xcite , for non - rotating stars .",
    "for the lower mass range of the systems studied here we were able to evolve the stars until the formation of an one core .",

    "another process that can overcome the difficulties posed by the results of @xcite and allow large quantities of calcium and other heavy elements to be accreted on to the companion is if the newly synthesized elements from the core of the sn expand in dense clumps .",
