    "the number `` @xmath9 '' here is the lyapunov exponent of a certain renormalizing dynamical system associated to the initial one .",
    "more precisely , it is the lyapunov exponent of certain subbundle of the hodge bundle under the kontsevich  zorich cocycle .",
    "the lyapunov exponents of the hodge bundle also govern the deviation spectrum for the asymptotic cycle of an orientable measured foliation , as well as the rate of convergence of ergodic averages for interval exchange transformations and for certain area preserving flows on surfaces see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the range of phenomena where the lyapunov exponents of the hodge bundle are extremely helpful keeps growing : nowadays , it includes , in particular , the evaluation of volumes of the moduli spaces of quadratic differentials on @xmath10 , see  @xcite , and the classification of commensurability classes of all presently known non - arithmetic ball quotients  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop the study of the lyapunov spectrum of invariant subbundles of the hodge bundle under the kontsevich  zorich cocycle ( with respect to general @xmath0-invariant measures ) .",
    "we revisit variational formulas of g.  forni from  @xcite for the hodge norm interpreting them in more geometric terms and we generalize them to invariant subbundles .",
    "we generalize forni s formulas for partial sums of the lyapunov exponents of the kontsevich ",
    "zorich cocycle in terms of geometric characteristics of the hodge bundle ( theorem  [ thm : partialsum ] in   [ ssec : formulas ] ) .",
    "we establish the reduciblity of the second fundamental form with respect to any decomposition into hodge star - invariant , hodge orthogonal subbundles and generalize the kontsevich formula for the sum of all non - negative exponents ( corollary  [ cor : kzformgen ] in   [ ssec : reduc ] ) .",
    "we investigate the occurrence of zero exponents with a particular emphasis on the relation between the central oseledets subbundle and the kernel of the second fundamental form .",
    "our main theorem in this direction ( theorem  [ th : ann ] in   [ ssec : central ] ) establishes sufficient conditions for the inclusion of one into the other , hence for their equality .",

    "the first model case , inspired by recent work of a.  eskin , m.  kontsevich and a.  zorich @xcite , is given by arithmetic teichmller curves of _ square - tiled cyclic covers _ ( introduced in @xcite ) ; the second model case is a certain @xmath0-invariant locus @xmath11 ( inspired by a paper of c.  mcmullen  @xcite ) supporting an @xmath0-invariant ergodic probability measure with some zero exponents .",
    "the study of square - tiled cyclic covers was motivated by the discovery of two arithmetic teichmller curves of square - tiled cyclic covers with maximally degenerate kontsevich  zorich spectrum ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "conjecturally there are no other @xmath0-invariant probability measures with maximally degenerate spectrum .",
    "progress on this conjecture has been made by m.  mller  @xcite in the case of teichmller curves and , recently , by d.  aulicino  @xcite in the general case .",
    "a conditional proof of the conjecture in sufficiently high genera can also be derived from a quite explicit formula for the sum of all non - negative exponents ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the case of square - tiled cyclic covers is especially rigid . in this case , the central oseledets subbundle is always @xmath0-invariant , smooth and in fact coincides with the kernel of the second fundamental form .",
    "this pictures does not hold in general .",
    "in fact , in our second model case the central oseledets subbundle does not coincide with the kernel of the second fundamental form even though it has the same rank .",
    "we emphasize that the rank of the kernel of the second fundamental form at generic points can be explained in all examples by symmetries ( automorphisms ) of the underlying surfaces . indeed , the discovery of the two above - mentioned maximally degenerate examples was based on a symmetry criterion for the vanishing of the second fundamental form on the complement of the tautological subbundle ( see @xcite , @xcite and   [ symmetry ] of this paper ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in  2 , we introduce the kontsevich ",
    "zorich cocycle on the hodge bundle over the moduli space of abelian differentials and we compute the relevant geometric tensors of the bundle , endowed with the hodge hermitian product , namely , the second fundamental form and the curvature of the hermitian connection with respect to the gauss - manin connection .",
    "we then prove first and second variational formulas for the hodge norm in terms of the second fundamental form and of the curvature . in  3 ,",
    "we derive formulas for partial sums of the exponents of the restriction of the kontsevich ",
