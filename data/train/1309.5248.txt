    "a set of effects is called coexistent if the members of the set can be measured together in a single experimental setup , meaning that they are in the range of a positive operator valued measure @xcite .",
    "the obvious mathematical problem related to this concept is to characterize those sets of effects that are coexistent .",
    "the first characterization of coexistence for a special type of qubit effect pairs was given in @xcite .",

    "the von neumann algebra of all bounded operators on @xmath2 is a factor of type @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the simplest choice for a generalization is a type @xmath3 von neumann algebra , i.e. , one which is a direct integral of two - dimensional matrix algebras . in finite dimensions direct integral is just a direct sum , and two matrices belonging to the same type @xmath3-algebra just means that they can be simultaneously diagonalized up to two - by - two blocks .",
    "this immediately suggests that the qubit characterization of coexistence generalizes to this case .",

    "we generalize the qubit coexistence result to all pairs of effects belonging to an arbitrary von neumann algebra generated by a pair of projections .",
    "technically , the characterization is expressed as the positivity of a certain function defined on the spectrum of a fixed central element of the algebra .",

    "as explained in the introduction , our characterization of coexistence of two effects belonging to the algebra of two projections is done by reducing the problem to two - dimensional cases .",

    "the coexistence relation in @xmath72 can be characterized by a single inequality :    [ qubitcoexthm ] @xmath28 if and only if @xmath73 .",
    "the form of the function @xmath69 simplifies for some special classes of effects , hence leading to an easier coexistence criterion .",
    "for instance ,    * if @xmath74 or @xmath75 is rank-1 then @xmath76 * if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are unbiased then @xmath77    in the latter case the coexistence criterion was first derived in @xcite .",
    "we also recall from @xcite that for two unbiased effects their coexistence is equivalent to . however , the coexistence of two arbitrary qubit effects is not equivalent to .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the idea of the present paper is to extend the qubit coexistence result to higher dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "this in mind , it is appropriate to review some quite direct ways how coexistence results for effects in a smaller hilbert space can be used to get information on the coexistence of some related effects in a larger hilbert space , and vice versa .",
    "let us first consider the passage from finite - dimensional hilbert spaces to infinite - dimensional .",

    "concerning the other direction , we first note that the projections @xmath86 converge strongly to the identity , so the effects @xmath87 and @xmath88 converge in the weak- * topology to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . assuming that @xmath89 ( as elements of @xmath84 ) , it follows that @xmath42 ( as elements of @xmath90 ) , because they act trivially outside the subspace .",
    "hence , it follows from prop .",
    "[ limitcoexlemma ] that @xmath28 .",
    "we conclude from prop .",
    "[ prop : sequence ] that coexistence in any separable hilbert space can in principle be reduced to coexistence in its finite - dimensional subspaces .",
    "next , we look at a basic way of obtaining larger finite - dimensional hilbert spaces from small ones , namely via the tensor product .",
    "let us consider a hilbert space @xmath91 and two pairs of effects : @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath94 and @xmath95 imply that @xmath96 . indeed , suppose that @xmath97 is a joint observable for @xmath98 and @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "then clearly the observable @xmath103 contains the effects @xmath104 and @xmath105 in its range .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the converse is not true : we may have @xmath96 even if @xmath94 and @xmath95 do not hold .",
    "this is demonstrated in the following example .",

    "hence , coexistence in a tensor product hilbert space can not be characterised in terms of coexistence in the tensor factors , even when the effects are in the product form .",
    "accordingly , the qubit characterisation only provides a sufficient condition for coexistence of two product form effects in a hilbert space of the form @xmath109 .",
    "in contrast to this fact , it is easy to see that coexistence is respected by _ direct sum",

    "the effect @xmath33 is decomposable , so all the effects of the corresponding joint observable given by are decomposable as well . for the converse part ,",

    "the generalisation is needed for the infinite - dimensional case , which is relevant because of applications to continuous variable systems , in particular , binarizations of the canonical variables .",
    "the proof requires some measure theoretic technicalities , which we do not consider essential at this point .",
    "we conclude from this discussion that direct sums , unlike tensor products , behave neatly under the coexistence relation .",
    "therefore , direct sums seem more appropriate way to generalize the qubit coexistence characterization to higher dimensions than tensor products .",
    "explicitly , the above proposition has the following consequence : in a hilbert space of even dimension , the coexistence of any two effects which can be simultaneously diagonalised up to two by two blocks , can be checked using the qubit characterisation .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , an interesting class of such effects is given by the algebra of two projections .",
    "this is the topic of the next section .",
    "we will utilize the known structure of the algebra generated by the two projections .",

    "[ dirintcoex ] that @xmath465 and @xmath466 are coexistent if and only if @xmath504 and @xmath505 are coexistent for almost all @xmath412 , in which case there exists a decomposable operator @xmath407 with @xmath480 for almost all @xmath412 .",
    "assuming now that this is the case , we fix @xmath506 , and define an isometry @xmath507 via @xmath508 , and set @xmath509 for all @xmath412 .",
    "then we have , for each @xmath510 , that @xmath511 is measurable ( because @xmath512 defines a vector in the direct integral ) , so @xmath513 is weakly , hence also strongly , measurable .",
    "since @xmath514 is a positive map , and @xmath515 for all @xmath441 , it follows that @xmath516 for almost all @xmath441 . hence , @xmath501 and @xmath502 are coexistent for almost all @xmath441 .",
    "moreover , @xmath517 is clearly an element of @xmath484 for almost all @xmath441 , so the decomposable operator @xmath518 given by @xmath519 defines a joint four - outcome observable for @xmath465 and @xmath466 .",
    "assuming , conversely , that @xmath501 and @xmath502 are coexistent for almost all @xmath441 , it trivially follows that @xmath467 and @xmath468 are coexistent for any such @xmath441 .",
    "finally , we will make use of the following form of the spectral theorem :    [ spectraltheorem ] let @xmath344 be a bounded selfadjoint operator in some separable hilbert space @xmath4 .",
    "then there exists a borel measure @xmath151 on the interval @xmath520\\subset { \\mathbb r}$ ] , and a family of hilbert spaces @xmath521 , such that @xmath4 is the direct integral space @xmath522 and @xmath344 is the diagonal multiplication operator @xmath523 .",
    "moreover , the measure class of @xmath151 is uniquely determined , and the spectrum @xmath524 of @xmath344 coincides with the support of @xmath151 , that is , @xmath525 the abelian von neumann algebra generated by @xmath344 coincides with the algebra of diagonal decomposable operators in this direct integral representation .",
    "we have presented a general condition for the coexistence of a pair of effects belonging to some von neumann algebra generated by two projections .",
    "this condition relies on a decomposition of given effects to blocks of two - by - two matrices and checking their coexistence , for which conditions are already known . by comparing our condition to the condition of generalized infimum we conclude that although provides a good sufficient condition , it is not a necessary condition .",
    "that is where our result proves useful .",
    "in a particular exemplary case of scaled projections we found our condition to provide another advantage .",
    "although the coexistence is in this case equivalent to , our results allow uncomplicated analysis .    since the main result of this paper characterizes the coexistence of effects in an algebra generated by two projections , one can ask when a given pair of effects belongs to such algebra .",
    "another natural question is if algebras generated by more than two projections also allow similar analysis .",
    "interestingly , the situation becomes rather intractable even with three projections .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the full algebra @xmath5 corresponding to any separable hilbert space is generated by three projections .",
    "this emphasises the special character of the algebra of two projections , which does not coincide with @xmath5 if @xmath526 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath527 , then the central element @xmath138 defined in [ eq : centralc ] must be a scalar multiple of the identity , but a short argument ( p. 970 in @xcite ) shows that this can not be true if @xmath526 . in general , the structure of algebras generated by three or more projections is known only in some special cases @xcite .",
    "after this negative result we can still ask whether every pair of effects belongs to the algebra generated by some pair of projections .",
    "this would mean that we could always apply prop .",
    "[ prop : compatibilityvnm ] , the remaining problem would just be to find the projections in question .",
    "however , it is easy to give examples of pair of effects that do not belong to any algebra generated by two projections .",
    "for instance , fix two orthonormal bases @xmath528 and @xmath529 satisfying @xmath530 for all @xmath531 .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be two full rank effects that are diagonal with nondegenerate eigenvalues in the bases @xmath528 and @xmath529 , respectively .",
    "then the spectral projections @xmath532 and @xmath533 are all in the von neumann algebra generated by these effects , so also each rank one operator @xmath534 is in the algebra . since any bounded operator is a weak- * limit of linear combinations of such operators , the von neumann algebra generated by @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the whole @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath526 there can not be projections @xmath123 and @xmath124 such that @xmath535 .",
    "we conclude that the results presented in this paper generalize the qubit coexistence characterization to a large set of effect pairs in all dimensions , and the introduced machinery provides an effortless tool to decide coexistence",
    ". however , we are still quite far from a complete characterization of all coexistent pairs of effects .",
