    "extinction in astronomy describes how much light is absorbed ( or scattered ) by dust grains in the medium between the source and the observer .",
    "locally , extinction is measured by comparing the light emitted from stars of similar spectral type , for which differential variations from interstellar dust can be assessed .",
    "local measurements in the milky way reveal a general trend in the extinction law although with significant scatter ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the behaviour of the extinction law reveals the overall properties of the dust grains in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "closer to home , light scattered by the small air molecules in the atmosphere follow a typical @xmath3 law that explains the blueness of the day - time sky .",
    "the typical milky way extinction law implies a shallower scaling dependence within the optical and near - infrared window , @xmath4@xcite .",
    "this effective law results from the integration of the contribution from all grains in the dust component . a distribution with smaller grain sizes would make this law steeper , and a distribution with larger grains would induce a shallower dependence with wavelength , approaching the mie regime @xcite , where there is no wavelength dependence ( i.e. clouds are white ) .",
    "one classical parameterisation of this smooth wavelength dependence is the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the extinction , measured in magnitudes , in the @xmath7 band , and @xmath8 is the colour excess , i.e. the additional reddening , measured as a @xmath9 colour , caused by dust .",
    "in addition to this smooth trend in the extinction law , there are some features characteristic of a specific component . in our analysis  extended to the near uv and optical spectral window ",
    "the most remarkable feature is the nuv bump at 2,175  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : atten ] . although the component responsible for this feature is not confirmed , it is possibly carbonaceous material , graphite , or pah molecules @xcite , although a more complex mixture is possible @xcite .",
    "nuv observations of the milky way extinction curve consistently find this feature ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in contrast , both lower metallicity regions , such as the small magellanic cloud @xcite , and starbursting galaxies @xcite , lack the nuv bump .",
    "an extinction law is a function that takes into account the wavelength - dependent obscuration due to absorption and scattering processes as light traverses a distribution of dust particles .",
    "one can therefore think of it as a foreground screen between the source and the observer .",
    "such a scenario is a valid representation when observing stars in the milky way .",
    "however , when we extend the analysis of dust to distant , mostly unresolved , galaxies , this process is complicated by the distribution of the dust , the variation of the composition within the observed region , and the underlying stellar populations .",
    "it is common to refer to this integrated effect of dust in galaxies as attenuation .",
    "galaxies with the same dust properties , hence with the same extinction , can yield different attenuation laws ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , the absence of the nuv bump in the attenuation law of starbursting galaxies @xcite can either be caused by an intrinsic lack of the component that causes this bump , or by the superposition of several stellar populations with different dust geometries @xcite .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this paper to disentangle extinction and attenuation , one should bear in mind this subtlety in the interpretation of the observational constraints .",
    "this work focuses on the dust component in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 ( ngc3034 ) located at a distance of @xmath103.3 - 3.5mpc @xcite , with a dynamical mass of @xmath11m@xmath12 @xcite . the ongoing strong star formation in this galaxy is believed to have been triggered by a close encounter with the more massive galaxy m81 , located in the same group .",
    "uv light extends out from the central regions of the galaxy where star formation is the strongest , revealing the presence of dust entrained in the supernov - driven wind . in (",
    "* hereafter hf14 ) we found that the dust obscuration in the nuv required the presence of an nuv bump , with the puzzling result that the prototypical starburst attenuation law of @xcite  which features no nuv bump  gave poorer fits than the standard milky way extinction of @xcite .",
    "this paper extends this issue by probing in more detail the dust properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of m82 , as a function of galactocentric distance .    literally , as the accepted hf14 paper went to press , an enthusiastic and diligently - led team of students at ucl s university of london observatory discovered sn2014j , a type  ia supernova , within 1kpc of the central starburst of m82 @xcite .",
    "a number of papers followed the evolution of the supernova ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and , most relevant to this paper , the properties of the dust ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) is a 30 cm instrument working as a photon counter , with three passbands in the nuv region , straddling the position of the 2,175  bump .",

    "the data were taken between 2008 and 2012 , therefore our photometry corresponds to the galaxy before the sn2014j event .",
    "in addition to the uvot data , we retrieved optical images from the sdss dr8 server @xcite .",
    "all images were registered to a common grid with a 0.5arcsec pixel size ( i.e. the uvot reference ) .",
    "the optical ( sdss ) images were convolved to a common spatial resolution with a moffat profile .",
    "we note that the effective resolution of the uvot images is @xmath20arcsec .",
    "photometry is performed within 5arcsec ( radius ) apertures , following the standard calibration of the uvot camera @xcite .",
    "the apertures were chosen to follow the disc of m82 ( see fig .  2 of hf14 ) .",
    "we also retrieved the galex/@xmath21 images of m82 from the mast archive , creating new sets of photometric measurements by convolving the uvot data to the ( poorer ) resolution of galex colour ] ( @xmath22arcsec ) .",
    "therefore , our combined dataset comprises photometry in the @xmath23 passbands .",
    "we refer the interested reader to hf14 for further details about the dataset .",
    "there are , however , two differences with respect to the hf14 data . here , we make use of an updated estimate of the foreground ( milky way ) reddening towards m82 . in hf14",
    "we took the value derived by @xcite , as given in the ned database , @xmath24mag . following the suggestion of @xcite , updated by @xcite , we choose a lower estimate of @xmath25mag .",
    "this correction is due to the fact that m82 affects the reading of the large scale dust maps used for the determination of foreground reddening .",
    "this change affects the correction made to the observed photometry , and the derivation of the dust parameters , since in this paper , the amount of correction from the milky way  which follows a @xmath26 @xcite law  is significantly reduced .",
    "nevertheless , we find that our results are compatible with hf14 .",
    "in addition , we use 3.3mpc for the distance to m82 , for a more consistent comparison with recent papers ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this change only affects the translation from angular distances to projected physical distances .",
    "the photometric apertures adopted in this paper map into a projected 160pc diameter .",
    "we follow the parameterisation of the attenuation law of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter csb10 ) .",
    "this function depends on two basic parameters : @xmath0 ( defined in  [ sec : intro ] ) , and @xmath1 , which controls the strength of the nuv bump .",
    "[ fig : atten ] shows a few realizations of the csb10 function , along with the standard milky way attenuation law from @xcite , assuming @xmath27 .",
    "notice that within the nuv spectral window ( left - hand panels ) , the uvot filters sample the bump , with uvm2 located in the middle of the feature and uvw2/uvw1 straddling it on the blue and red sides , respectively .",
    "in addition , the galex / fuv filter includes an additional measurement blueward of the bump .",
    "the case @xmath1=1 corresponds very nearly to the standard milky way extinction curve , by construction .",
    "we follow a simple one - zone model for the dust component , assuming the light from the stellar populations is affected by a foreground dust screen",
    ". other methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would result in a more complex set of parameters , whereas we focus here on an `` effective '' attenuation law integrated to all the light within the aperture ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    in hf14",
    ", we compared the nuv and optical photometry of m82 with a range of stellar population models , and two typical attenuation curves , the above mentioned milky way standard of @xcite , and the law of @xcite usually applied to star - bursting systems such as m82 .",
    "we found that the latter  which lacks the presence of an nuv bump  gave poorer fits to the nuv photometry with respect to a milky - way law . in this paper , we explore in more detail this issue by use of the parameterization of csb10 .",
    "in addition to the nuv bump , the photometric data can be used to constrain the parameter @xmath0 , which depends on the composition of the dust grains . a standard milky way law assumes @xmath27 , although with significant scatter , roughly between 2.2 and 5.8 @xcite .",
    "lower ( higher ) values of @xmath0 will require a distribution of smaller ( larger ) dust grains , with respect to the milky way standard . in hf14 , we studied the extraplanar light originated from the reflection of the stellar light in the galaxy , that impinged on the dust grains above and below the galactic plane .",
    "these dust grains were entrained in the material ejected by the strong galactic winds triggered by the starburst . we fitted the photometric data assuming the absorption / scattering processes are described by a power law ( @xmath28 ) , finding a value ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "note , however , that this case pertains to the scattering of light from dust grains in the extraplanar wind region , as they are illuminated by the galaxy .",
    "in contrast , we focus in this paper on the efective attenuation law in the main body of the galaxy .    the right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : atten ] show a wide nuv / optical spectral window , focusing on variations of @xmath0 .",
    "note how higher values of @xmath0  as expected in an ism with larger dust grains  result in a flatter attenuation law , closer to the mie regime .",
    "therefore , the use of a wide spectral range ( nuv and optical photometry ) will allow us to constrain this parameter .",
    "in order to constrain the dust attenuation parameters , we need to quantify the effect of the other , `` nuisance '' , parameters related to the underlying stellar population .",
    "our methodology involves a comparison of the observed nuv and optical photometry with a large grid of synthetic populations from the models of @xcite . tab .",
    "[ tab : params ] shows the grid of 8,388,608 models used in this paper .",
    "they correspond to simple stellar populations ( ssp , representing a population with a single age and metallicity ) for a standard initial mass function @xcite . within our wavelength interval",
    ", dust simply introduces a smooth , long ( spectral ) range behaviour ( aside from the nuv bump ) .",
    "therefore it is possible to factor out the attenuation law from the different trends introduced in the photometry by the age and metallicity distribution of the populations . to prove this point , we ran three sets of simulations , each one with a different assumption about the star formation history : i ) ssp ( as above ) ; ii ) exp : a composite of stellar populations following an exponentially decaying star formation rate , choosing the formation epoch , decay timescale and metallicity as free parameters of the populations ; iii ) 2ssp , a superposition of two ssps , where the age of the young and old components , the fractional contribution , by mass , of the young component , and the metallicity are free parameters .",
    "these three choices encompass a wide range of both smooth and bursty star formation histories .",
    "this exercise serves to understand whether systematic biases are being introduced because of a methodology where the analysis is based on a grid of ssps .",
    "the derivation of the model parameters follows a bayesian approach , using a @xmath30-based likelihood as a probability distribution function ( @xmath31 ) from which we derive the errors as the 68% confidence level of this distribution .",

    "[ fig : m82_rv ] ) , with the central regions showing a standard milky way attenuation law , progressing outwards towards an extinction with a weaker nuv bump and steeper @xmath0 , more characteristic of a smaller grain size distribution , effectively tending towards the standard attenuation law of the smc @xcite .",
    "we should note here that our results correspond to a one - zone model , where the dust only contributes as a foreground screen .",
    "changes in the geometry of the dust distribution can therefore cause variations on the dust parameters presented here ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the weaker bump in the outer regions can be indicative of changes in the dust properties @xcite , although an age - dependent attenuation law can produce similar effects @xcite .",

    "a trend towards a weaker bump is found at large galacto - centric distances , _ away _ from the central starburst , where the dust content is lower , and where @xmath0 is low , indicative of smaller dust grains ( see fig .  [",

    "our data were taken before the event , and therefore probe the properties of the dust of the ism . at the position of sn2014j , we find a standard dust component , typical of the milky way , with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
