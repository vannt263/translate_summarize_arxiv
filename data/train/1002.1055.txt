    "the well - known hilbert s 16th problem is remained unsolved since hilbert  @xcite proposed the 23 mathematical problems at the second international congress of mathematics in 1990 .",
    "recently , a modern version of the second part of the 16th problem was formulated by smale  @xcite , chosen as one of the 18 challenging mathematical problems for the 21st century . to be more specific ,",
    "consider the following planar system : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent @xmath5-degree polynomials of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the second part of hilbert s 16th problem is to find the upper bound @xmath8 on the number of limit cycles that the system can have , where @xmath9 is a universal constant , and @xmath10 is called hilbert number . in early 90 s of the last century ,",
    "ilyashenko  @xcite and calle  @xcite proved the finiteness theorem pioneered by dulac , for given planar polynomial vector fields .",
    "in general the finiteness problem has not been solved even for quadratic systems .",
    "a recent survey article  @xcite ( and more references therein ) has comprehensively discussed this problem and reported the recent progress .",
    "if the problem is restricted to the neighborhood of isolated fixed points , then the question is reduced to studying degenerate hopf bifurcations , which give rise to fine focus points . in the past six decades",
    ", many researchers have considered the local problem and obtained many results ( e.g. , see  [ 612 ] ) . in the last 20 years , much progress on finite cyclicity near a fine focus point or a homoclinic loop has been achieved .",
    "roughly speaking , the so - called finite cyclicity means that at most a finite number of limit cycles can exist in some neighborhood of focus points or homoclinic loop under small perturbations on the system s parameters .    in this paper , we particularly consider bifurcation of limit cycles in quadratic systems .",
    "early results can be found in a survey article by ye  @xcite .",
    "some recent progress has been reported in a number of papers ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) . for general quadratic system ( [ b1 ] ) ( @xmath11 ) , in 1952 , bautin  @xcite proved that there exist @xmath12 small limit cycles around a fine focus point or a center .",
    "after @xmath13 years , until the end of 1970 s , concrete examples were given to show that general quadratic systems can have @xmath0 limit cycles  @xcite , around two foci with @xmath1 configuration .",
    "since then , many researchers have paid attention to integrable quadratic systems , and a number of results have been obtained .",
    "a question was naturally raised : can near - integrable quadratic systems have @xmath0 limit cycles ?",
    "a quadratic system is called near - integrable if it is a perturbation of a quadratic integrable system by quadratic polynomials . on one hand , it is reasonable to believe that the answer should be positive since general quadratic systems have at least @xmath0 limit cycles ; while on the other hand , near - integrable quadratic systems have limitations on their system parameters and thus it is more difficulty to find @xmath0 limit cycles in such systems .",
    "in fact , this is still an open problem after another @xmath13 years since the finding of @xmath0 limit cycles in general quadratic systems .",
    "the study of bifurcation of limit cycles for near - integrable systems is related to the so called weak hilbert s 16th problem  @xcite , which is transformed to finding the maximal number of isolated zeros of the abelian integral or melnikov function : m(h , ) = _ h(x , y)=h q_n dx - p_n dy , b2 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are all real polynomials of @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the weak hilbert s 16th problem is a very important problem , closely related to the maximal number of limit cycles of the following near - hamiltonian system  @xcite : = + p_n(x , y ) , = - + q_n(x , y ) , b3 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are polynomials of @xmath23 and @xmath7 , and @xmath24 is a small perturbation .",
    "general quadratic systems with one center have been classified by oladek  @xcite using a complex analysis on the condition of the center , as four systems : @xmath25  the lotka - volterra system ; @xmath26  hamiltonian system ; @xmath27  reversible system ; and @xmath28  codimension-4 system . in 1994 ,",
    "horozov and iliev  @xcite proved that in quadratic perturbation of generic quadratic hamiltonian vector fields with one center and three saddle points there can appear at most two limit cycles , and this bound is exact .",
    "later , gavrilov  @xcite extended horozov and iliev s method to give a fairly complete analysis on quadratic hamiltonian systems with quadratic perturbations .",
    "quadratic hamiltonian systems , with at most four singularities , can be classified as three cases  @xcite : ( i ) one center and three saddle points ; ( ii ) one center and one saddle point ; and ( iii ) two centers and two saddle points . in  @xcite",
    ", gavrilov showed that like case ( i ) , cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) can also have at most two limit cycles . therefore ,",
    "generic quadratic hamiltonian systems with quadratic perturbations can have maximal two limit cycles , and this case has been completely solved .    for the @xmath27 reversible system , there have been many results published . for example , dumortier _ el al . _",
    "@xcite studied a case of @xmath27 system with two centers and two unbounded heteroclinic loops , and presented a complete analysis of quadratic @xmath12-parameter unfolding .",
    "it was proved that @xmath12 is the maximal number of limit cycles surrounding a single focus , and only the @xmath29-configuration can occur in case of simultaneous nests of limit cycles .",
    "that is , @xmath12 is the maximal number of limit cycles for the system they studied  @xcite .",
    "later , peng  @xcite considered a similar case with a homoclinic loop and showed that @xmath30 is the maximal number of limit cycles which can bifurcate from the system . around the same time ,",
    "yu and li  @xcite investigated a similar case as peng considered but with a varied parameter in a certain interval , and obtained the same conclusion as peng s .",
    "later , iliev  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite re - investigated the same case but for the varied parameter in a different interval ( which yields two centers ) and got the same conclusion as that of  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath12 is the maximal number of limit cycles which can be obtained from this case . recently , li and llibre  @xcite considered a different case of @xmath27 system which can exhibit the configurations of limit cycles : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath29 and @xmath33 .",
    "again , no @xmath0 limit cycles were found . in order to explain why the above authors did not find @xmath0 limit cycles from the @xmath27 reversible system ,",
    "consider the @xmath27 system with quadratic perturbations , which can be described by  @xcite    ll = - y + a x^2 + b y^2 + ( _ 1 x + _ 2 xy ) , + = x ( 1 + c y ) + _ 3 x^2 ,    b4 where @xmath34 are real parameters , @xmath35 are real perturbation parameters , and @xmath36 . when @xmath37 , system ( [ b4])@xmath38 is a reversible integrable system . it has been noted that in all the cases considered in  @xcite , the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 were chosen as @xmath41 , but with @xmath42 in  @xcite ; @xmath43 in  @xcite , @xmath44 in  @xcite , and @xmath45 in  @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "complete analysis on the perturbation parameters was carried out with the aid of poincar transformation and the picard - fuchs equation , but it needed to fix all ( or most of ) the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 . this way it may miss opportunity to find more limit cycles , such as possible existence of @xmath0 limit cycles . as a matter of fact , for the cases considered in  @xcite , a simple scaling on the parameter @xmath48 ( @xmath49 )",
    "can be used to eliminate @xmath48 .",
    "so , suppose the non - perturbed system ( [ b4])@xmath38 has two free parameters and let us consider the 2-dimensional parameter plane .",
    "then , all the cases studied in the above mentioned articles are special cases , represented by just a point or a line segment in the 2-dimensional parameter plane ( see more details in section 2 ) .",
    "it has been noted that a different method was used in  @xcite with melnikov function up to second order , but no more limit cycles were found .",
    "it should be mentioned that zhang  @xcite has proved that the possible cycle distributions in general quadratic systems with two foci must be @xmath50-distribution or @xmath51-distribution , @xmath52 .",
    "so far , no results have been obtained for @xmath53 .",
    "this result also rules out the possibility of @xmath54-distribution .",
    "it is conjectured that at most @xmath12 limit cycles can exist around one focus point .",
    "the problem of bifurcation of @xmath12 limit cycles near an isolated homoclinic loop is still open .    in this paper",
    ", we turn to a different angle to consider bifurcation of limit cycles in quadratic near - integrable systems with two centers .",
    "we shall leave more free parameters in the integrable systems , so that we will have more chances to find more limit cycles .",
    "the basic idea is as follows : we first consider bifurcation of multiple limit cycles from hopf singularity , which does not need to fix any parameters , and use expansion of melnikov function near centers to get such limit cycles as many as possible .",
    "this leads to determination of a maximal number of parameters .",
    "then , for the remaining undetermined parameters , we compute the global melnikov function to look for possible large limit cycles . indeed , although , due to the complex integrating factor in the analysis , we are not able to give a complete analysis for classifying the perturbation unfolding , we do get a positive answer to the open question of existence of @xmath0 limit cycles in quadratic near - integrable systems . in particular , we will show that perturbing a reversible , integrable quadratic system with two centers can have at least @xmath0 limit cycles , with @xmath1 distribution , bifurcating from the two centers under quadratic perturbations .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a different classification in real domain for quadratic systems with one center , and compare it with that given by oladek  @xcite .",
    "also , we use our classification to present a simple summary on some of the existing results for the reversible near - integrable system .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis on bifurcation of small limit cycles from hopf singularity . in section 4 ,",
    "we show how to find large limit cycles bifurcating from closed orbits to obtain a total of @xmath0 limit cycles .",
    "finally , conclusion is drawn in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we give a different classification in real domain for quadratic systems with a center , which is consistent with the hamiltonian systems considered in  @xcite .",
    "we start from the following general quadratic system :    ll = c_100 + c_110 z_1 + c_101 z_2 + c_120 z_1 ^ 2 + c_111 z_1 z_2 + c_102 z_2 ^ 2 , + [ 1.5ex ] = c_200 + c_210 z_1 + c_201 z_2 + c_220 z_1 ^ 2 + c_211 z_1 z_2 + c_202 z_2 ^ 2 ,    b5 where @xmath55 s are real constant parameters .",
    "it is easy to show that this system has at most four singularities , or more precisely , it can have @xmath56 , @xmath30 or @xmath0 singularities in real domain . in order for system ( [ b5 ] ) to have limit cycles , the system must have some singularity . in this paper , we assume that system ( [ b5 ] ) has at least two singularities . without loss of generality , we may assume that one singular point is located at the origin @xmath31 , which implies @xmath57 , and the other at @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "further assume the origin is a linear center .",
    "then introducing a series of linear transformations , parameter rescaling and time rescaling to system ( [ b5 ] ) yields the following general quadratic system :    ll = y + a_1 x y + a_2 y^2 , + [ 1.5ex ] = - x + x^2 + a_3 x y + a_4 y^2 ,    b6 which has a linear center at the origin @xmath31 and another singularity at @xmath60 .    in order to have the origin of system ( [ b6 ] ) being a center",

    "b12 we will show later in this section , when we compare our above real classification with the complex classification given by oladek  @xcite , that the case defined by ( [ b12 ] ) actually belongs to the @xmath68-reversible system .",
