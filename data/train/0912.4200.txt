    "<S> a variety of detectors has been proposed for dark matter direct detection , but most of them  by the fact  are still at r&d stage . in many cases , it is claimed that the lack of an adequate detectors radio - purity might be compensated through heavy uses of montecarlo simulations , subtractions and handlings of the measured counting rates , in order to claim higher sensitivity ( just for a particular scenario ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of a correct evaluation of systematic effects in the use of montecarlo simulations at very low energy ( which has always been safely discouraged in the field so far ) and of multiple subtractions and handling procedures applied to the measured counting rate is shortly addressed here at some extent . </S>",
    "<S> many other aspects would also deserve suitably deep investigations .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> some arguments presented at the taup09 conference will be shortly summarized . </S>",
    "<S> more details , tables and figures can be found in the slides at the conference site@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us firstly comment the possibility of reliable evaluations of the background contributions at the kev energy region in the field of dark matter searches . as well known , it has been generally discouraged this procedure in the field of dark matter over more than twenty years . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the estimation by a montecarlo simulation of the background component in the counting rate from the residual radioactivity requires a detailed knowledge of : i ) the exact set - up geometry ( detector or detectors matrix , all materials , details of the assembling , of the shield layers , of the site , etc . ) ; ii ) the detector response function ( e.g. energy resolution , @xmath0 ratio , channeling , etc . ) ; iii ) the nature , the position and the concentration of all the existing radioactive contaminants ; iv ) etc .. unfortunately , apart from the geometrical layout of the set - up that are generally well known by people inside the experimental group , all the other quantities necessary in the montecarlo simulation require dedicated measurements . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there are some quantities ( such as concentration of residual contaminants , etc . ) that can be poorly known and just upper / lower limits are available ; in some cases these quantities can be even totally unknown . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , the experimental energy resolution as a function of the energy and the energy scale should be measured / verified down to the energy threshold , as done e.g. by the dama / libra experiment where they are continuously measured by external / internal known sources from mev down to the energy threshold @xcite . on the contrary , in other experiments these quantities </S>",
    "<S> are instead extrapolated from calibrations at much higher energy ( as done e.g. by liquid noble gas set - ups , where the energy threshold and the few kev energy scale are generally unproven , also because of position dependence , of non - uniform signal collection , etc . ; see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the presence of residual contaminants in the set - up , generally only limits on the contributions of the `` standard '' contaminants are given ; these limits forbid any reliable estimation of the background ( being unknown the exact values ) and can not be obviously exceeded ( see also later ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , possible presence of many non - standard contaminants should be also included . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the montecarlo simulation also depends on the precise location of all the contaminants  that is generally unknown even for the `` standard '' ones  in complex set - ups . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is more complex for multi - detectors set - up and when the energy distribution refers to events where each detector has all the others in anticoincidence ( _ single - hit _ events ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is trivial to conclude that a reliable precise simulation of the background counting rate  in particular at kev energy region  is not univocally determined and is a quite impossible task .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , beyond the fore - mentioned arguments , we need to take into account that a montecarlo code can not manage all the possible low energy atomic physical processes . </S>",
    "<S> this argument is still subject of improvements ; in fact , as an example , non - negligible differences are also obtained by different versions of the same montecarlo code @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> some instructive examples are given by the trails in montecarlo simulations in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown there , these simulations noticeably differ from the measured energy distributions in the cases of xenon-10 and of zeplin - iii . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , they predict twice the measured rate for xenon-10 near 200 kev , and more than one order of magnitude the measured rate for zeplin - iii in the mev range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same approach has been also pursued by the same authors @xcite trying a montecarlo simulation of the background in the dama / libra set - up . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , apart from errors in the details of the set - up geometry reconstruction and in the multiple - hit definition , many crude and arbitrary approximations in the nature and in the location of the residual contaminants have been arbitrarily assumed ; in fact , e.g. : i ) only standard contaminants , ii ) only unbroken chains , iii ) only uniform location of contaminants in the detectors , etc . have been taken into account . as a result of this rough , partial and arbitrary approach , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted rate has been estimated within a factor 10 lower than the measured one . instead of refining the quality of the simulation or reasonably recognizing the impossibility of precise determination , the authors just pursued the exercise of arbitrarily increasing `` by hand '' the assumed values of the contaminants at levels much larger than the measured experimental limits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this also implies an overestimate of the background in higher energy region with respect to the measured experimental rate . in conclusion , although the arbitrary and the erroneous adopted procedures , these authors do not succeed in reproducing either the low or the high energy spectra . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as a conclusion of this arbitrary exercise @xcite , this artificially - boosted simulated spectrum has been subtracted by the measured one , attempting to obtain a limit for the unmodulated dark matter signal component . </S>",
    "<S> this example shows how subtraction procedures using montecarlo simulations in the few kev energy region can give rise to erroneous conclusions ; thus , any constraint on dark matter signal on this basis would be an artefact .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , let us also note that the measured spectra e.g. of the existing / past nai(tl ) detectors ( such as e.g. anais , frejus , naiad , elegant , etc ... ) do not support even the shape presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , well different counting rates at kev energy region are present even for detectors of the same experimental group , as e.g. the case of naiad in 1996 and in 2003 @xcite . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , it does not exist an unique recipe for a precise and reliable montecarlo simulation of whatever set - up , and for nai(tl ) in particular .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally remind that a safer approach has been presented in this conference by dama collaboration ; this shows that enough space is present in the measured counting rate of the dama / libra kev energy spectrum for the unmodulated component of dark matter signal @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in the second part of this contribution @xcite , problems related to the application of multiple subtraction procedures of the measured counting rate , as pursued by experiments trying to identify the presence of recoil nuclei in the measured energy spectrum , have been summarized . in fact , many of the existing dark matter candidates  also in the wimp class  can give rise to signals that either have totally an electromagnetic nature ( see e.g. @xcite ) or involve electromagnetic signals associated to nuclear recoils ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; obviously , approaches that are based on multiple subtraction procedure of the electromagnetic component of the counting rate are blind to similar scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , well known side processes exist for recoils ( such as recoils induced by neutrons , fission fragments , end - range alphas , surface electrons , etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is generally pursued when the detectors suffer from a not - suitable radiopurity level in the sensitive target - material and in the surroundings .    </S>",
    "<S> those activities generally apply a large number of cut procedures to the data ; each one is affected by non - negligible systematic errors which are usually not suitable quantified . as an example , the xenon-10 experiment applies more than 10 different cuts to the data ; the experiment collects @xmath1 events but only 10 are claimed to survive to the cuts and handling procedures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very high reduction factors following applied multiple cuts are dangerous because of the difficult precise estimate of all the involved systematics . for example , it has been shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that zeplin - i has claimed a sensitivity 3 orders of magnitude larger than the one properly obtained when accounting for systematics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the robustness of some results appeared in the `` race for the best exclusion - plot '' ( valid just in a single set of assumptions for a certain kind of wimp ) should be considered `` cum grano salis '' . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for some liquid noble gas set - ups , apart from the robustness of the applied cuts themselves , the very low energy scale and the energy threshold are determined by extrapolating from calibrations at much higher energy and applying some kind of corrections for relevant non - uniformity of the detector s response ; with a light yield of about 2.2 photoelectrons / kev and not specific calibrations even @xmath2 1.5 - 2 kev electron equivalent is claimed as energy threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering the energy threshold dependence of the exclusion plots , up to several orders of magnitude differences can be present between claimed and realistic evaluation of the experimental sensitivity .    </S>",
    "<S> another crucial aspect is the proper accounting for the existing experimental and theoretical uncertainties in the calculation and in the comparison of experiments using different target materials and approaches . </S>"
