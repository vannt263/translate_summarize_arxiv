    "photon pairs have been utilized in various fields such as fundamental physics and have found applications in quantum computation and communication , because they show various types of quantum correlations , for example , polarization correlation @xcite , time - frequency correlation @xcite , and spatial correlation @xcite .",
    "two - photon interference is one of the pure quantum phenomena attributed to quantum correlations . in experiments on two - photon interference",
    ", each photon pair behaves like a quantum object called a `` _ biphoton _ , '' whose effective energy ( or frequency ) is twice that of the original photons , and the interference fringe of the photon pair has half the period of a one - photon interference fringe @xcite .",
    "two - photon interference can be applied to high - resolution lithographic technology that overcomes the classical diffraction limit @xcite .    three - wave mixing ( twm ) in @xmath0 nonlinear crystals has been extensively used for the generation of photon pairs @xcite . recently , four - wave mixing ( fwm ) in @xmath1 nonlinear material has also been studied as an effective method to produce entangled photon pairs @xcite . in twm ,",
    "a pump photon is split into a pair of photons , while in fwm , two photons in the pumping beam are converted into a pair of time - correlated photons .",
    "therefore , in fwm , the resolution of two - photon interference is twice that of one - photon interference produced by the pumping light .",
    "optical fibers can be used for fwm because of the single - transverse - mode , low loss , propagation in the small cores .",
    "high - visibility interference requires a single - mode character that allows us to introduce the generated photon pairs into fiber - based networks easily .",
    "high nonlinearity can be achieved by confining the optical field to small area .",
    "therefore , photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) with small core diameters are expected to be useful .",
    "the phase matching condition for fwm requires that the pump wavelength be close to the zero - dispersion wavelength of the fiber .",
    "various types of pcfs with zero - dispersion wavelengths different from those of conventional fibers are commercially available .    in this paper , first , we discuss a method for the generation of photon pairs with a pcf .",
    "we derive the phase matching condition , which is a function of the dispersion relation of a @xmath1 medium , and obtain the photon pair spectrum from the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) in the datasheet of the pcf used in our experiment .",
    "the calculated result shows that the width of the photon pair spectrum is sufficiently high to evade the effect of raman - scattered photons when the wavelength of pump light is slightly above the zero - dispersion wavelength . in accordance with the result",
    ", we demonstrate the generation of photon pairs and obtain @xmath2 / @xmath3 photon pairs at a rate of @xmath4 and a pump power of @xmath5 .",
    "next , we introduce these photon pairs into an unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer with a long arm and a short arm to verify their time correlation . in this interferometer , which shares the same principle as franson interferometer @xcite , two quantum states corresponding to the case where both photons transverse the same arm contribute to the two - photon interference . by precise coincidence counting for eliminating the possibility that each photon follows a different path",
    ", we obtain definite two - photon interference fringes with 83% visibility exceeding the classical limit , which provides clear evidence for the time correlation of the photon pairs .",

    "the energy conservation law requires that @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 correspond to the angular frequencies of the pump , signal , and idler photons , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of photon pairs is determined by the dispersion relation @xmath11 of the medium .",
    "the number of photon pairs within a spectral width @xmath12 and a time interval @xmath13 is expressed as follows : @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a nonlinear coefficient , @xmath17 is the pump power , and @xmath18 is the interaction length @xcite .    equation ( [ energy_conservation ] ) shows that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are symmetrically located with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the spectral separation between the pump photon and the photon pairs can be written as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the separation @xmath21 should be large in order to evade spontaneous raman scattering , whose spectrum spreads over several hundred nanometers around the pump wavelength .",
    "we use a polarization - maintaining pcf with the zero - dispersion wavelength @xmath22 ( crystal fiber , nl - pm-760 ) , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath11 can be derived from the group velocity dispersion @xmath25 , which is provided by the manufacturer .",

    "( [ n ] ) as a function of the pump wavelength @xmath28 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by two distinct parts : the trunk near @xmath28 and the branches bifurcating at @xmath29 .",
    "these parts are classified with the phase matching condition @xmath30 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phasematch ] ) : @xmath31 for the trunk part and @xmath32 for the branch part . because the trunk part usually overlaps the spectrum of the raman - scattered photons , it is difficult to single out the photon pairs .",
    "in contrast , the spectrum of the branch part is well separated from that of the raman - scattered photons for @xmath33 .    in order to avoid raman scattering , we set the pump wavelength slightly higher than the zero - dispersion wavelength @xmath34 .",

    "if the path difference @xmath61 is larger than the coherent length of each photon , the probability of finding both the photons at port @xmath46 is given as follows : @xmath62 the visibility of two - photon interference is only 50% , which is equal to the classical limit @xcite , because the second and third terms in eq .",

    "we can derive the relation between @xmath71 and the voltage applied to the piezo actuator from the one - photon interference pattern @xmath72 for the pump field by monitoring the signal of the photodiode ( pd ) .",
    "in all experiments , the pump laser is operated at a power of @xmath5 , which produces about @xmath73 pairs per second at the detectors without the interferometer .",
    "the rate at which photon pairs are produced is sufficient for the experiment on two - photon interference , and the accidental coincidence rates are negligibly small .",
    "we first measured one - photon interference for the signal and idler photons by individually counting the photons .",
    "figure [ fig : one ] shows the count rates as a function of @xmath71 . as expected , there is no clear interference fringe , because @xmath61 is much larger than the coherent length of each photon . (",
    "the faint fringe for the idler photons can be attributed to the influence of the residual pump light . )",
    "we performed two types of two - photon interference experiments by changing the gate time @xmath68 for coincidence counting .",
    "first , we set @xmath74 to measure the coincidence count rate that involves all the photon pairs passing through the interferometer .",
    "figure [ fig : result - long ] shows the one - photon interference pattern of the pump light ( dotted line ) for a reference and the two - photon interference pattern of the photon pairs ( circles ) . the period of the two - photon interference fringe is half that of the one - photon interference fringe for the pump light . the visibility is only 40% , which is consistent with eq .",

    "the result shows that the photon pairs generated in the pcf have time correlations that can be explained only by the quantum theory .",
    "the main reason for the degradation of the visibility is mainly due to the chromatic aberration of the objective lens that collimates the photon pairs from the pcf . by using an objective lens specially designed for red and infrared wavelengths , the visibility of two - photon interference",
    "will be improved .",
    "in this paper , we report the generation of photon pairs by four - wave mixing in the photonic crystal fiber and the two - photon interference of the photon pairs . by maintaining the wavelength of the pump light slightly above the zero - dispersion wavelength",
    ", we obtained a wider spectrum of photon pairs as compared to that of raman - scattered photons .",
    "we set the pump light wavelength to @xmath76 and obtained @xmath2/@xmath3 photon pairs at @xmath77 with a pump power of only @xmath5 , which could be generated by a diode laser . because the photon pairs were emitted in a single - transverse mode of the fiber , all of them contributed to the interference effectively without any spatial filtering .",
    "the high brightness of the photon pairs per mode is an advantage of the fiber - based sources over crystal - based sources .    for higher photon - pair flux",
    ", we can use an intense pulse laser with slight modification in the two - photon interferometer @xcite . in general , the conversion efficiency increases with the fiber length .",
    "however , due to the losses , a fiber longer than the fiber attenuation length , which is about @xmath78 for our fiber with @xmath79 losses , is of no use .    two - photon interference achieved using the unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer produced clear interference fringes with 83% visibility , which exceeds the classical limit .",
    "the period of the fringes was half that of the pump light wavelength , which is different from the case of two - photon interference where photon pairs were generated through twm .",
    "this shows that two - photon interference of photon pairs through fwm can be beneficial to high - resolution lithographic technology and phase - sensitive interferometries .",
