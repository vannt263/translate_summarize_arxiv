    "quantum billiards are quite simple models for many practical applications in solid state and nuclear physics , as e.g. quantum dots , microdisk lasers and electron transport in microstructures .",
    "an important means for the study of quantum billiards is the statistics of the quantum mechanical energy levels of a given system , where the distance distribution @xmath5 of the normalized distances @xmath6 between two consecutive energy levels @xmath7 and @xmath8 with the mean distance @xmath9 has the following two limiting cases .",
    "( i ) the poisson distribution , @xmath10 $ ] , which is the distance distribution of uncorrelated numbers @xmath8 and ( ii ) the wigner distribution @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "an example for the case ( i ) are the energy levels of a single symmetry group of an electron in a 2d potential well in the shape of a square , rectangle or circle ( integrable systems ) . as a second example",
    ", localized states in disordered systems tend to the poisson distribution with increasing system size , which is largely used in solid state physics to distinguish between localized and extended states in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "an example for the case ( ii ) are the energy levels of chaotic billiards , as e.g. the stadium or the sinai billiard .    in close analogy",
    "is the behavior of a classical particle in a billiard , which undergoes elastic reflections at the walls .",
    "it also has two limiting cases , depending on the billiard geometry .",
    "if the billiard is chaotic , the motion of the particle is ergodically extended over the whole energy surface in phase space .",
    "two particles whose trajectories are very close at the beginning , diverge exponentially from each other .",
    "if the system is integrable on the other hand , the motion of the particle is restricted to a two - dimensional torus in phase space and neighboring trajectories diverge only linearly from each other .",
    "there are , however , several classes of intermediate systems between the two limiting cases , as e.g. polygonal pseudointegrable systems @xcite , on which we focuse in this paper , or systems with a pointlike scatterer (  seba - billiards  ) @xcite . like in integrable systems , the motion of a classical particle in a pseudointegrable system",
    "is restricted to a two - dimensional surface in phase space .",
    "however , these surfaces do not have the shapes of tori but are more complicated objects with more than one hole .",
    "they are called  multihandeled spheres  . examples for pseudointegrable systems are polygons with only rational angles @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and at least one @xmath14 .",
    "they are described by their genus number @xmath15 which is equal to the number of holes in the multihandeled sphere in phase space . here",
    ", @xmath16 is the number of angles and @xmath17 is the least common multiple of the @xmath18 .",
    "the reason that those systems are not completely integrable is their property of beam splitting . at some points in their geometry , neighboring trajectories of particles can be split into two opposite directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "several works @xcite found the distance distribution of pseudointegrable systems intermediate between the poisson- and the wigner distribution . ref .",
    "@xcite presented a numerical investigation of pseudointegrable billiards of small genus numbers , where the boundary was approached by a step function , which was arranged along the curved shape of the ( chaotic ) sinai billiard . with decreasing size and increasing number of the steps",
    ", the level statistics of this system approached the wigner statistics .",
    "however , as it was pointed out in this work , the analysis was performed at very small energies , where the wavelengths were larger than the step sizes .",
    "so , it was assumed that the wigner - like level statistics was not an inherent feature of the pseudointegrable shapes , but came from the underlying assymptotic shape of the sinai billiard .",
    "pseudointegrable systems of small genus numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 were investigated numerically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , showing an intermediate level statistics that clearly deviated from the wigner distribution . in @xcite ,",
    "numerical simulations on systems with increasing genus numbers up to @xmath21 indicated that for not too small energies , the distance distribution changes systematically from poisson - like towards wigner - like behavior with increasing @xmath2 . also for seba billiards , it was shown by general arguments and numerical calculations that the level statistics is intermediate and close to wigner - like behavior for small level distances @xcite .",
    "the wigner - like behavior is increased with the number and the coupling strength of the pointlike scatterers in the system @xcite .",
    "the level statistics seems to be connected to the properties of the eigenfunctions .",
    "for example , in a billiard with @xmath19 it was found that there are regular and irregular eigenfunctions coexisting @xcite . in the husimi representation ,",
    "the eigenfunctions of systems with small @xmath2 show signatures of pseudointegrability , whereas those of systems with large @xmath2 tend to be irregular @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we want to investigate the energy dependence of the level statistics of a special class of pseudointegrable systems with high genus numbers . at low energies",
    ", it is known that one can observe a level statistics that deviates from the high - energy limit , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for pseudointegrable and in refs .",
    "@xcite for chaotic billiards . here",
    "we find that for our systems , there can be many energy windows , where the level statistics is comparatively close to poisson statistics , and other energy intervals , where the behavior is close to wigner statistics .",
    "we show that this behavior is correlated to the properties of the eigenfunctions and that there exist several characteristic types of such intervals , even at energy values , where the boundary roughness is resolved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the special pseudointegrable geometries that we consider . in section iii , we show the results of the level statistics of the eigenvalues for several systems of different values of @xmath2 . in section iv , we investigate the eigenfunctions @xmath22 in these energy intervals and introduce several quantitative measures , i.e. , the localization volume @xmath23 , the amplitude distribution @xmath24 and the behavior of the eigenfunctions in @xmath25-space .",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 differ in their normalization , @xmath28 , with the area @xmath29 of the system .",
    "finally , in section v , we apply those measures to many eigenfunctions in the different energy intervals .",
    "we find that in intervals where the energy - levels behave poisson - like , the eigenfunctions are either localized or regular .",
    "energy intervals with level statistics close to wigner - like behavior , on the other hand , contain eigenfunctions that are random superpositions of plane waves .",
    "also an interesting mixed case appears , where the superposition of plane waves leads to weak localization .",
    "we consider a membrane of the sound velocity @xmath30 that lies in the @xmath31-plane and vibrates in the @xmath32-direction .",
    "when the restoring forces are considered as scalar , the vibrations of this membrane are described by the helmholtz equation @xmath33 with the @xmath34 eigenfunction @xmath35 , the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath36 .",
    "the boundary conditions can be of dirichlet or of neumann type , referring to a membrane that is kept fixed at the boundary or that can vibrate freely , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ basic ] ) has the same form as the stationary schrdinger equation with zero potential @xmath37 inside the system .",
    "therefore , under dirichlet boundary conditions , which refer to an infinite potential on the boundary , it also describes an electron of mass @xmath38 in an infinite potential well . in this case",
    ", one has to replace @xmath39 by @xmath40 , with the energy eigenvalue @xmath8 .    for the numerical calculations , eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) is discretized on a square lattice , which reduces the problem to the diagonalization of a symmetric matrix , which is carried out here by the lanczos algorithm @xcite , a numerical procedure to compute eigenvalues und -vectors of sparse @xmath41-matrices by reducing them iteratively to a tridiagonal form , for which effective algorithms exist .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath8 are calculated numerically under dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions and their spectra are analyzed by the means of level statistics .",
    "the @xmath8 are dimensionless quantities , as we set @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the lattice constant of the discrete lattice .    as a model for our studies we chose rational billiards of the shape presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with different parameters , refering to different numbers , widths , distances and heights of the  teeth  .",
    "the genus numbers of these geometries can be easily increased by increasing the number of teeth .",
    "two different angles occur , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . applying eq .",
    "( [ genus ] ) we find that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of angles of values @xmath46 .",
    "the systems have no symmetry axes and it is therefore not necessary to separate the calculated eigenvalues according to their symmetry groups ( which would be technically difficult ) .",
    "the considered parameters range from systems with only few teeth and therefore very small genus numbers up to systems of @xmath49 .",
    "we now analyze the eigenvalues by the means of level statistics .",
    "the energy levels @xmath8 are normalized (  unfolded  ) to new values @xmath50 , such that their mean distance @xmath51 is equal to @xmath52 .",
    "then , we calculate the following two quantities :    \\(i ) from the nearest neighbor spacing distribution @xmath5 , it has become common to calculate the second half moments @xmath53 which lie between the two limiting values @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( see refs .",
    "this enables us to decide , if the statistics is closer to wigner or closer to poisson by comparing just one number @xmath0 and is more comfortable in handling than @xmath5 itself .",
    "\\(ii ) another measure , which turns out to be even more sensitive to @xmath2 is the spectral rigidity @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the length of the considered energy interval @xcite .",
    "@xmath56 starts from the integrated density of states @xmath58 of the unfolded energy levels @xmath50 , which is a staircase and can be approached by a straight line of slope one .",
    "@xmath56 is defined as the least square deviation , @xmath59 ^ 2 d{\\varepsilon}\\right{\\rangle},\\ ] ] where @xmath60 means that the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are chosen such that the line @xmath63 is the best fit of @xmath64 . for the calculation of",
    "@xmath56 we use the technique derived in ref .",
    "the limiting values are @xmath65 for integrable systems and @xmath66 for the ensemble of gaussian orthogonal matrices ( goe ) @xcite , which serves as a general accepted good limit for chaotic systems .",
    "this means that in the first case , @xmath56 increases linearly with @xmath57 , and in the second case logarithmically .",
    "as discussed above , we expect intermediate behavior for pseudointegrable billiards .    in this paper , we will basically use @xmath0 as the easier of the two measures . however , we first want to compare the behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for several systems , ranging from very small values of @xmath67 until @xmath68 at higher energies . the parameters of these systems are shown in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] .",
    "all systems have roughly the same area and exactly the same widths and heights of the teeth , @xmath69 , where @xmath44 is the lattice constant .    in figs .  [ fig2](a ) and ( c )",
    "we plotted the values of @xmath0 for dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions versus the energy . in figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and ( d ) we show the @xmath56-data of the fixed energy intervals @xmath70 $ ] versus @xmath57 .",
    "the energy interval is chosen such that the wavelength , @xmath71 is smaller than the widths of the teeth and therefore the boundary roughness is resolved .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 shows many fluctuations but its average value decreases systematically with growing @xmath2 towards the wigner limit , which is shown as a solid line . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( c ) , we also see that the behavior for both boundary conditions is quite similar .",
    "the only exception occurs at very small energies , where @xmath0 lies considerably higher in the dirichlet case .",
    "the reason for this is that the condition @xmath72 exactly at the boundary prevents the long - wavelengths eigenfunctions to penetrate into the small boundary teeths .",
    "the same  screening  of the boundary roughness at small energies has already been observed for fractal drums @xcite . for @xmath1 of pseudointegrable systems",
    "it was shown in @xcite by a semiclassical periodic orbit theory that it depends on several details , e.g. on the energy interval and on the area of the system . however , by keeping the billiard area , the energy interval and the height and width of the teeth fixed , we find also for @xmath1 a smooth and systematic behavior , that depends on @xmath2 .    the behavior of @xmath56 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( c ) ) corresponds to the one of @xmath0 .",
    "those systems with small genus numbers @xmath2 show high values of @xmath0 and accordingly values of @xmath56 , which are close to @xmath73 ( dotted line ) .",
    "systems with high genus numbers @xmath2 on the other hand , show @xmath0-values close to @xmath74 and accordingly @xmath1-curves , which are also closer to the wigner - limit ( solid line ) . similar to the case of seba billiards , they come very close to the wigner distribution for small @xmath57 . @xmath56 turns out to be a more sensitive measure than @xmath0 in the case of large @xmath2-values . while the values of @xmath0 for systems with genus numbers @xmath75 lie already so close to the wigner limit that a succession between them can hardly be recognized , we still observe clear differences between the individual curves of @xmath1 in the case of larger level distances .",
    "however , also the @xmath1 data indicate a systematic change from poisson - like towards wigner - like behavior with increasing @xmath2 .    in the following , we concentrate on @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 for several selected systems with different heights , widths and numbers of the teeth in the energy range of @xmath76 $ ] , which corresponds to roughly @xmath77 energy levels .",
    "the calculations were made in intervals of energy @xmath78 , each of them containing about @xmath79 levels . here , we applied neumann boundary conditions in all cases .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 under dirichlet boundary conditions is qualitatively similar .",
    "first , we discuss the case of random values of the parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( tab .",
    "[ table2 ] ) . for the first system @xmath84 the values were uniformly distributed between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , for the second system @xmath87 between @xmath85 and @xmath88 .",
    "the areas of the systems are again kept roughly constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) , @xmath0 is plotted versus the energy @xmath89 for the systems @xmath84 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath87 ( solid lines ) . for most energy values",
    ", we find a roughly constant value of @xmath0 that lies close to the wigner - value .",
    "only for very low energy values , @xmath90 $ ] ( which corresponds to roughly @xmath91 levels ) , @xmath0 shows deviations from the high energy behaviour , towards higher values .",
    "this is due to the finite resolution of the boundary roughness in the limit of long wavelengths , where the systems look more regular .",
    "so , for a random structure of the boundary roughness , the high energy limit is reached quickly and no deviations of the @xmath0 values from the wigner limit are seen beyond the first @xmath92 states .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b - c ) , @xmath0 is plotted versus @xmath89 for two types of systems with periodic boundary roughness , whose parameters are presented in tab .",
    "[ table3 ] .",
    "in the first group ( fig .  [ fig3](b ) ) , all systems have the same widths @xmath93 and numbers @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the  teeth  ( and correspondingly the same genus number @xmath96 ) .",
    "the heights of the teeth are different , @xmath97 for system @xmath98 ( solid lines ) , @xmath99 for system @xmath100 ( dotted lines ) and @xmath101 for system @xmath102 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we first see that the narrow teeth account for a large low - energy regime with poisson - like behaviour .",
    "additionaly , we observe sharp peaks of the @xmath0 values at several energies , which become more pronounced with increasing @xmath83 and are most probably due to the periodic structures of the geometry .",
    "we will discuss these peaks in the following sections .",
    "the second group ( cf .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ) consists of billiards with larger widths @xmath103 .",
    "this group of billiards shows less and only small peaks in the @xmath0-values and the high energy regime is reached quite quickly .",
    "therefore we found two types of systems , where the high energy limit is reached quickly : geometries with broad teeth and geometries with a random distribution of the teeth widths . in systems with very narrow and regular teeth , on the other hand , energy windows appear , where the behavior of the system deviates significantly from the described behavior in the high - energy regime . in these intervals , the values of @xmath0",
    "are considerably larger than the expected high - energy values .",
    "these energy windows are most interesting and we look at them in more detail now .",
    "there are three different effects , which may lead to higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "first , at smaller energies ( larger wavelengths ) , the teeth could not be sufficiently resolved and the states see only the rectangular main body of the system .",
    "this is the case for small energies , when half a wavelength is larger than the width @xmath80 and the eigenfunctions are not small enough to penetrate the teeth .",
    "second , also at higher energy values , the periodic structure of the teeth could allow for very regular functions , even if the boundary roughness is fully resolved .",
    "also in this case , we expect a distribution close to poisson .",
    "third , also localized states can be a reason for the spectrum to behave poisson - like .",
    "therefore , we expect that @xmath0 is closely related to special system properties and should be reflected in the shape of the eigenfunctions . in order to understand this",
    ", we now investigate the eigenfunctions in the different energy windows .",
    "some typical eigenfunctions of the system @xmath102 under neumann boundary conditions are presented on fig .",
    "they are taken from the different energy regimes ( labeled from @xmath104 to @xmath105 ) , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig4](f ) . due to technical restrictions of the lanczos algorithm",
    ", we could not calculate eigenfunctions of arbitrary high energies in large system sizes .",
    "the reason is that the density of states increases with the energy and the eigenfunctions become too close to each other and thus could not be seperated . at lower energies , we find the following characteristic shapes :    the eigenfunctions @xmath106 and @xmath107 of fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and ( b ) are taken from the energy regime @xmath104 , where @xmath0 has the peak value of @xmath108 , very close to the poisson value .",
    "the functions look different . while the function @xmath106 on fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) looks very regular and extended , function @xmath107 on fig .  [",
    "fig4](b ) is a rather localized ( and regular ) function , where non - zero amplitudes exist basically close to the boundary , i.e. inside the boundary teeth .",
    "figure  [ fig4](c ) ( regime @xmath109 on the fig .",
    "[ fig4](f ) ) represents rather the case of a chaotic function , i.e. the amplitude looks very random .",
    "accordingly , we find @xmath110 in this energy regime , closer to the wigner value . the function @xmath111 on fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) ( regime @xmath112 on the fig .  [ fig4](f ) ) looks again regular and @xmath113 is again close to the poisson value .",
    "the difference of this function to the function @xmath106 is the smaller wavelength in regime @xmath112 . here ,",
    "the boundary roughness is to some extent resolved and the reason for the regular wavefunction lies in the periodicity of the teeth .",
    "these regular wavefunctions at higher energies should disappear in systems with random boundary roughness .",
    "figure  [ fig4](e ) ( regime @xmath105 on the fig .",
    "[ fig4](f ) ) represents an interesting intermediate case of a function that is chaotic as well as localized .",
    "@xmath0 in this case is @xmath114 , rather close to the wigner value . the function @xmath115 looks random in the inner rectangular part of the billiard , but its amplitudes in this part are very small .",
    "the largest amplitudes of the function are localized on the border of the teeth .",
    "so this case is in some sense intermediate between a localized and a chaotic function .",
    "this seems to be a weak localization mechanism , where the wave is reflected at the boundary roughness and interferes constructively inside the teeth .",
    "accordingly , we found four characteristic types of eigenfunctions , regular ones , localized ones , chaotic ones and intermediate ones between chaotic and localized .",
    "all eigenfunctions seem to correspond to energy windows , which can be characterized by their corresponding @xmath0-values .",
    "we now introduce several measures for the eigenfunctions that allow us to distinguish between those cases .",
    "\\(i ) as a first characteristics for the eigenfunction analysis we used the distribution of the amplitudes @xmath3 . by semiclassical arguments",
    "it was conjectured that for classically chaotic systems most eigenfunctions are a random superposition of plane waves , which leads to an amplitude distribution that is a gaussian function @xcite , @xmath116 where @xmath28 is normalized according to @xmath117 with the area @xmath29 of the billiard .",
    "this normalization allows us to compare eigenfunctions of systems with different sizes .",

    "next , we look at the average amplitude distributions in our four regimes , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( a - e ) by the full circles .",
    "since in the regime @xmath104 two types of eigenfunctions exist , we split them into two groups according to their @xmath140-values .",
    "the average amplitude distribution for 263 states with @xmath168 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and the one for 78 functions with @xmath169 on fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "the distributions in the regimes @xmath170 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( c - e ) by full circles .",
    "the distributions are very close to those for the individual functions ( open circles ) , from the preceeding section , showing that the features , which we found for the single functions are characteristic for a whole energy regime .",
    "the eigenfunctions of regime @xmath104 are either localized or regular , the eigenfunctions of regime @xmath109 chaotic , the eigenfunctions of regime @xmath112 again close to regular functions and in regime @xmath105 , there are a lot of intermediate functions between localized and chaotic .",
    "it is remarkable that even the intermediate functions cover a whole energy window and explains the discrepancy between the rather small values of @xmath140 and the value of @xmath0 , which is close to the wigner - limit .    with these measures in mind",
    ", we can finally look at the systems with a random distribution of teeth widths , where @xmath0 approached the wigner limit very fast . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we show ( a ) the histogram of the @xmath140-values and in ( b ) the amplitude distribution of @xmath171 eigenfunctions of system @xmath84 in the energy interval @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "the values of the localization volumes show a narrow distribution around the value of @xmath173 of gaussian functions and the amplitude distribution @xmath3 coincides with a gaussian function .",
    "so , these functions are quite obviously a random superposition of plane waves .",
    "in summary , we investigated the level statistics and the eigenfunctions of pseudointegrable rough billiards with high genus numbers @xmath2 .",
    "they had a rectangular body and a rough boundary with small  teeth  of different widths , distances and heights .",
    "the level statistics was found to be intermediate between poisson- and wigner - like behavior and approached the latter with increasing @xmath2 . especially for small level distances , the @xmath1-curves can come very close to the wigner statistics .",
    "this behavior was similar to the one of seba billiards with an increasing number of pointlike scatterers @xcite .",
    "additionally , we found different energy intervals with characteristic types of eigenfunctions , which correspond to a special behavior of the level statistics . in order to classify the eigenfunctions we employed several measures : the localization volume @xmath140 , the amplitude distribution @xmath3 and the behavior of the eigenfunctions in @xmath25-space .",
    "we found that all systems have a low - energy regime , where the wavelengths of the eigenfunctions are too large to resolve the boundary teeth and thus only see the main rectangular body of the billiard .",
    "the eigenfunctions in the low - energy regime have the characteristics of regular functions with the level statistics close to the poisson distribution .",
    "however , for systems with a random distribution of the boundary teeth or for very broad teeth , this regime stays very small and the high - energy regime is quickly reached .    for higher energies , the eigenfunctions of systems with either random boundary roughness or with not too small teeth , are characterized by a close - to - gaussian amplitude distribution @xmath3 with a localization volume of @xmath4 .",
    "they can be constructed by a random superposition of many regular functions .",
    "the second half moments @xmath0 of the energy spacing distribution @xmath5 at higher energies are ",
    "apart from fluctuations  energy - independent and close to a wigner - like behavior for large @xmath75 .",
    "also the spectral rigidity @xmath1 changes from poisson - like towards wigner - like behavior when @xmath2 increases .",
    "however , @xmath1 changes slower and still shows deviations from the wigner behavior even for large @xmath2 .    for the case of periodic and narrow boundary teeth ,",
    "we find many energy regimes , where the level statistics is close to poisson behavior .",
    "we find that those functions are either localized with very small values of @xmath140 or regular cosine functions with @xmath140 close to @xmath165 .",
    "also an interesting regime occurs , where the eigenfunctions show intermediate behavior with chaotic traces in the main body of the system but very high amplitudes inside the teeth , indicating weak localization .",
    "accordingly , deviations from a wigner - like behavior of the level statistics are due to three different effects , ( i ) a poor resolution of the boundary roughness at very small energies , ( ii ) regular wavefunctions due to periodic boundary roughness and ( iii ) localization . however , for random boundary roughness and not too small energies , those effects are not pronounced and the eigenfunctions can mostly be described by a random superposition of plane waves , which is for pseudointegrable systems remarkable .    for further research it would be interesting to investigate the eigenfunctions in the high - energy regime , which might help to understand the @xmath1 data for large values of @xmath2 . as @xmath1 measures the long - range correlations between eigenvalues it seems likely that even a very small amount of regular or localized eigenfunctions in an energy interval of otherwise chaotic functions can lead to these deviations",
