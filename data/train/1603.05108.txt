    "in recent years , plasmonics has been receiving a great attention from scientists because of its ability to achieve highly confined electromagnetic field and to manipulate light at nano - scale .",
    "nonlinear plasmonics might be of interest because the nonlinearity can be controlled by the power allowing a management of the solution unlike the linear case .",
    "nonlinear plasmonic slot waveguides ( npsws ) have been a flourishing research topic , at least since 2007 ,  @xcite due to the strong light confinement in the nonlinear dielectric core ensured by the surrounding metal regions and due to its peculiar nonlinear effects  @xcite .",
    "one of the key property of symmetric npsws is the existence of asymmetric modes that emerge at critical powers through hopf bifurcations from the first symmetric mode and also from some higher order symmetric modes  @xcite .",
    "several applications have already been proposed for npsws including phase matching in higher harmonic generation processes  @xcite , nonlinear plasmonic couplers  @xcite or switching  @xcite , and also for biological and chemical sensors  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental observation of plasmon - soliton waves in these npsws is still lacking even if linear slot waveguides have already been fabricated  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of the single nonlinear dielectric / metal interface structures  @xcite , the modes already studied in the simple npsws suffer from high propagation losses that seriously limit the propagation length of the waves . in the present study",
    ", we propose and study an improved structure in which buffer linear dielectric layers are added between the nonlinear dielectric core and the two semi - infinite metal regions . for the tm case ,",
    "these supplementary layers have two main consequences .",
    "first , they modify the types of solutions that propagate in the npsws adding new profiles , enlarging the possibilities offered by theses nonlinear waveguides .",
    "second , they reduced overall losses and allow the losses to decrease with the power in most of the cases . for the te case ,",
    "they reduce the cut - off core thickness for the fundamental linear mode , and increase its propagation length . for the nonlinear case , the losses decrease with the increase of the power for all the te modes , and the nonlinear symmetric mode moves gradually to new nonlinear mode in which the soliton intensity profile displays two peaks in the middle of the waveguide .",
    "we also demonstrate the bifurcation of the asymmetric nonlinear mode from the symmetric one for the te polarized waves .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we describe the model and numerical method we use to study the stationary nonlinear waves in the improved npsw we propose . in sec .  [",

    "third , we provide the full nonlinear phase diagram of the main tm modes as a function of the total power and the buffer layer . in sec .",

    "this approximation of the kerr nonlinearity , taking into account only the transverse component of the electric field has already been used in several models of the npsws  @xcite .",
    "it provides similar results than the more accurate approach where all the electric field components are considered in the optical kerr effect  @xcite , even if at high power its results differ from the ones obtained with the full model taking into account all the electric field components in the nonlinear term  @xcite .",
    "this approximation allows us to use the fixed power algorithm in the finite element method ( fem ) to compute the nonlinear stationary solutions and their nonlinear dispersion curves  @xcite . in the core ,",
    "the approximated relation between the nonlinear parameter @xmath14 and the coefficient @xmath15 , that appears in the definition of an intensity dependent refractive index @xmath16 , is @xmath17 , where the intensity inside the core is defined as @xmath18 , and the vacuum permittivity is denoted by @xmath19 . for the te case , the only nonzero component of the electric field is @xmath20 and the permittivity in the core is defined as @xmath21 , with @xmath13 ( focusing nonlinearity ) . in general , the te surface plasmon waves do not exit due to continuity of the component @xmath20 .",
