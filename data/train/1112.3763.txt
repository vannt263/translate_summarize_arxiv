    "understanding effective equilibrium interactions between two charged mesoscopic bodies immersed in a solution , is essential in various fields of colloid science , from physics @xcite to biochemistry @xcite .",
    "references @xcite offer a general overview .",
    "a breakthrough in the field was achieved when it was realized in the 1980s , from numerical evidences , that equivalently charged surfaces may effectively attract each other , under strong enough coulombic couplings .",
    "such couplings can be realized in practice by increasing the valency of the counter - ions involved @xcite .",
    "this `` anomalous '' like - charge attraction explains the formation of dna condensates @xcite or aggregates of colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "a complementary interesting although simpler to rationalize problem is the possibility of an effective repulsion between two plates with opposite uniform surface charges .",
    "the weak - coupling limit is described by the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) mean - field approach .",
    "formulating the coulomb problem as a field theory , the pb equation can be viewed as the first - order term of a systematic expansion in loops @xcite . while the like - charge attraction is not predicted by the pb theory @xcite",
    ", the opposite - charge repulsion can occur already in the mean - field treatment @xcite , since it is merely an entropic effect with a large cost for confining particles in a small volume .",
    "a remarkable theoretical progress has been made during the past decade in the opposite strong - coupling ( sc ) limit , formulated initially for a single wall or two parallel walls at small separation .",
    "the topic was pioneered by rouzina and bloomfield @xcite and developed further by shklovskii , levin with collaborators @xcite .",
    "an essential aspect is that counter - ions form two - dimensional ( 2d ) highly correlated layers at charged walls at temperature @xmath0 . for small but non vanishing temperatures ,",
    "the structure of interfacial counter - ions remains close to its ground - state counterpart .    within the field - theoretical formulation , which has been put forward by netz and collaborators in @xcite ,",
    "the leading sc behavior is a single - particle theory in the potential of the charged wall(s ) .",
    "next correction orders as obtained as a virial or fugacity expansion in inverse powers of the coupling constant @xmath1 , defined below ; we refer to this approach as the virial strong - coupling ( vsc ) theory .",
    "the method requires a renormalization of infrared divergences via the electroneutrality condition . a comparison with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite indicated the adequacy of the vsc approach to capture the leading large-@xmath1 behaviour of the density profile , which was an important achievement in the field .",
    "the first correction has the right functional form in space but an incorrect prefactor , whose values even depart further from the mc ones as the coupling constant @xmath1 grows .",
    "this deficiency was attributed by the authors to the existence of an infinite sequence of higher - order logarithmic terms in the fugacity which have to be resummed to recover the correct value of the prefactor .",
    "the _ leading _ order of the vsc theory was generalized to non - symmetrically charges plates @xcite , image charge effects @xcite , presence of salt @xcite and to various curved ( spherical and cylindrical ) geometries , for a review , see @xcite . beyond refs .",
    "@xcite , several investigations assessed numerically the adequacy of the leading order vsc approach @xcite .    since the coupling constant @xmath2 , the zero temperature is contained in the vsc approach as the limit @xmath3 .",
    "this question requires some care though , since a natural rescaled distance @xmath4 in the direction perpendicular to the plate(s ) is set by the gouy - chapman length @xmath5 , which tends to zero as @xmath6 . from this point of view",
    ", the vsc method can be seen as a low - temperature theory approaching @xmath0 under a special spatial scaling of particle coordinates .",
    "one of the restrictions is the applicability of the theory to small ( rescaled ) distances between the charged plates .",
    "there exist other possibilities to approach the zero temperature limit .",
    "one of them is to construct an expansion in @xmath1 around the limit @xmath3 , under the fixed ratio of the distance @xmath7 ( in the two plate problem ) and the lattice spacing @xmath8 of the wigner crystal formed at @xmath0 .",
    "the low - temperature theory proposed by lau et al .",
    "@xcite , can be considered in some respect as being of this kind .",
    "the considered model consists of two staggered hexagonal wigner crystals of counter - ions condensed on the plates ; the particles are not allowed to move in the slab between the plates .",
    "the attraction between the plates at zero and non - zero temperatures , which results from the interaction of the staggered wigner crystals and from the particle fluctuations , can be computed . since the particles are not allowed to leave their wigner plane , the counter - ion profile between the two plates is trivial and",
    "there is no need for a spatial scaling .",
    "such a model is interesting on its own , but has a restricted applicability to realistic systems of counterions because the particles are assumed to stick to the plates",
    ". this assumption may be perhaps acceptable at large distances between plates , but discards from the outset the excitations that are relevant at small distances , where the counter - ions unbind from the interfaces ( see e.g. @xcite and the analysis below ) .",
    "an interpolation between the poisson - boltzmann ( low @xmath1 ) and sc regimes ( high @xmath1 ) , based on the idea of a `` correlation hole '' , was the subject of a series of works @xcite .",
    "the correlation hole was specified empirically in refs . @xcite and self - consistently , as an optimization condition for the grand partition function , in @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation in @xcite , corroborated by a comparison with the mc simulations , was that the first correction in the sc expansion is proportional to @xmath9 , and not to @xmath10 as suggested by the vsc theory .",
    "our exact expansion below shows that indeed , the first correction scales like @xmath9 .",
    "recently , for the geometries of one plate and two equivalently charged plates with counter - ions only , we proposed another type of sc theory @xcite .",
    "it is based on a low - temperature expansion in particle deviations around the ground state formed by the 2d wigner crystal of counter - ions at the plate(s ) .",
    "the approach points to the primary importance of the structure of the ground state , a point emphasized by some authors , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "our starting point therefore resembles that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but in the subsequent analysis , the particles vibrations around their wigner lattice positions are allowed along all directions , including the direction perpendicular to the crystal plane along which the particle density varies in a nontrivial way . the theory is formulated in the set - up of the original vsc approach : an sc expansion around the same limit @xmath3 is made , together with the same scaling of the coordinate in the direction perpendicular to the plate(s ) , @xmath4 . since the formation of the wigner crystal is the basic ingredient from which the method starts , we shall refer to it as the wsc theory .",
    "its leading order stems from a single - particle theory , and is identical to the leading order obtained in the vsc approach . in the present planar geometry ,",
    "both wsc and vsc differ beyond the leading order , when the first correction is considered . in this respect , in assessing the physical relevance of wsc and vsc , comparison to `` exact '' numerical data is essential .",
    "remarkably , the first wsc correction has the functional form in space of the vsc prediction , but the prefactor is different : its @xmath9 dependence on the coupling parameter and the value of the corresponding prefactor are in excellent agreement with available data of mc simulations , while the vsc prediction is off by several orders of magnitude under strong coulombic couplings @xcite .",
    "unlike the vsc theory , the wsc expansion is free of divergences , without any need for a renormalization of parameters .",
    "the wsc expansion turns out to be in inverse powers of @xmath11 , and not of @xmath1 like in the case of the vsc expansion . due to its relatively simple derivation and algebraic structure",
    ", the wsc method has a potential applicability to a large variety of sc phenomena .",
    "in particular , the wsc can be worked out beyond the leading order for asymmetric plates , which , to our knowledge , was not done at the vsc level , possibly due to the technical difficulty to overcome .",
    "the specific 2d coulomb systems with logarithmic pair interactions were treated at wsc level in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at laying solid grounds for the wsc method .",
    "we develop the mathematical formalism initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on a cumulant expansion , to capture systematically vibrations of counter - ions around their wigner crystal positions .",
    "this formalism enables us to deal , in the leading order plus the first correction , also with asymmetric , likely or oppositely charged plates .",
    "the results obtained are in remarkable agreement with mc data , for large as well as intermediate values of the coupling parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the one - plate geometry is studied in sec . [",
    "sec : oneplate ] .",
    "an analysis is made of counter - ions vibrations around their ground - state positions in the wigner crystal , along both transversal and longitudinal directions with respect to the plate surface .",
    "the cumulant technique , providing us with the wsc expansions of the particle density profile in powers of @xmath9 , is explained in detail .",
    "[ sec : twoplates ] deals with the geometry of two parallel plates at small separation .",
    "the cumulant technique is first implemented for equivalently charged plates and afterwards for asymmetrically charged plates . in the case of the opposite - charged plates , the wsc results for the pressure are in agreement with mc simulations for small plate separations and lead to the correct ( nonzero ) large - distance asymptotics . in the case of the like - charged plates",
    ", the accurate wsc results for the pressure are limited to small plate separations .",
    "all obtained results represent an essential improvement over the vsc estimates .",

    "before we embark on our study , a semantic point is in order .",
    "some authors refer to the vsc approach as the `` sc theory '' . clearly , the vsc route is not the only theory that can be put forward to describe the strong coupling regime . in",
    "what follows , the sc limit refers to @xmath12 , and we carefully discriminate between vsc and wsc predictions , that will both be tested against monte carlo data .",

    "it is well behaved when @xmath44 , which is nevertheless a limit where in unscaled variables , all counterions stick to the plate , forming the wigner crystal ( @xmath45 for @xmath3 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present discussion is to resolve the structure of the double - layer at large but finite @xmath1 . according to the vsc method @xcite , the density profile of counter - ions",

    "a generalization of the formalism to quantum statistical systems of counter - ions is straightforward : vibrations of counter - ions around their wigner - lattice positions possess energy spectrum of quantized harmonic oscillators .",
    "another perspective is to formulate a strong - coupling theory valid for an arbitrary distance between the plates . indeed , both the original virial sc and the present wigner sc theories are so far limited , in the two plate case , to the regime @xmath391 , which means that the inter plate distance should be smaller than the lattice spacing @xmath8 in the underlying wigner crystal ( up to an irrelevant prefactor , the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath258 introduced in this article refer to the same length ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that the limitation @xmath391 is not intrinsic to the strong coupling limit , but is a technical requirement that should be enforced to allow for the validity of the single particle picture , and subsequent higher order corrections as worked out here .",
    "performing the sc expansion for distances @xmath392 requires to bypass the single particle picture , which is a challenging goal .",
