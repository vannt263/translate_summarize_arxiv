    "gaia rvs is a slitless spectrograph , so some degree of crowding due to spectral tracing overlaps in the focal plane is to be expected .",
    "overlapping spectra increase the effective background signal and make it highly ununiform . in an acompanying paper ( zwitter 2002 )",
    "we show that superpositions of spectral lines of background stars can be removed by careful modelling . here",
    "we use photometry of actual stellar fields in 66 directions in the galaxy to assess the probability for an overlap , as well as the typical spectral type of overlappers .",
    "we use b , v , and i@xmath1 photometry of 66 fields around a sample of symbiotic stars ( henden &  munari 2000 , 2001 ) . these fields",
    "were observed with the usno flagstaff station , 1.0 m telescope and two ccd detectors .",
    "the exposures were designed to permit accurate photometry of the symbiotic star , and so were of varying depth depending on the brightness of the target star .",
    "however , all fields are relatively complete to @xmath2 with stellar detections reaching @xmath3 . only photometric ,",
    "good seeing nights were used , with extinction and transformation coefficients determined from nightly measures of landolt standard stars .",
    "aperture photometry was used , with a minimum of three observations on separate photometric nights per field .",
    "typical zeropoint errors are around @xmath4mag .",
    "more complete description of the observations and techniques can be found in the referenced papers .",
    "these fields can be used to assess stellar density and distribution of spectral types down to the gaia faintness limit .",
    "a total of 75959 stars were analyzed .",
    "the luminosity function for @xmath5 is frequently described by a potential law . here",
    "we adopt a heuristic law @xmath6 which gives a better fit to the data ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the relation is compatible with star counts predictions by the galaxy model ( esa - sci(2000)4 , torra et al .",

    "average star density of ( @xmath0 ) stars equals 15100 stars / degree@xmath7 close to the galactic plane ( @xmath8 ) and 1900 stars / degree@xmath7 away from it ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the corresponding values ( 6100 and 1200 stars / degree@xmath7 ) from the galaxy model ( esa - sci ( 2000)4 ) .",
    "this is probably a statistical anomaly ; symbiotic stars tend to lie close to the galactic plane and selection effects may emphasize regions of higher star density . even so only 10%  of directions close to the galactic plane ( @xmath8 ) reach the density of 40000 ( @xmath0 ) stars per degree@xmath7 .",
    "spectral types of field stars cluster around an early k type at the bright end , reaching a mid - k for the faintest targets ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the sampling law of the gaia satellite guaranties that the arrangement of stars in the focal plane will be different for each of the @xmath10 transits of a given star , providing that the spin and precession periods of the satellite are kept incommensurate .",
    "two stars that badly overlap in one passage have non - overlapping tracings on the next pass .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that the length of the spectral tracing in the dispersion direction is much larger than its width .",
    "there will be unfortunate cases , for example close optical doubles , with tracings overlapping in a significant fraction of observations .",
    "but such stars are rare and so of no interest to us here .",
    "below we discuss the results on spectral overlaps for typical randomly positioned stars in the focal plane .",
    "two spectra overlap with a probability @xmath11 if the length of the spectrum is larger than the free length @xmath12\\ ] ] where the star density equals @xmath13 stars per degree@xmath7 and the width of the stellar tracing is @xmath14 arc - sec ( @xmath15 arc - sec for the astrium design of the gaia spectrograph ) .",

    "we shall comment on the result for a resolution of 10,000 assuming a spectral width of 4.5 arcsec .",
    "results for other resolutions and spectral widths can be easily judged from table 1 .",
    "the wavelength interval of gaia spectra covers 250    around @xmath16   .",
    "the spectral length for @xmath17 is 580 pixels , assuming 2 pixels per resolution element .",
    "since each pixel covers 1  arcsec on the sky in the dispersion direction the spectral overlap with another ( @xmath0 ) star will occur if the distance between spectral heads is smaller than 580 arcsec .",
    "one can see from table 1 that this happens in some 21 out of 100 spectra if the star density is 1200 stars / deg@xmath7 , a typical value for field stars with @xmath0 at high galactic latitudes . density of fainter stars at the same position is much higher ( see eq .  1 ) , so overlaps with @xmath18 stars are common even at high latitudes",
    ". if one considers overlapping stars down to @xmath19 the probability for an overlap increases to 97% . if the resolution were smaller than @xmath20 the length of the spectral tracing covering the gaia spectral wavelength interval would be shorter .",
    "still it is clear that lower spectral resolutions can not make spectra free from spectral overlaps of faint stars even at high galactic latitudes .",
    "fraction of spectra overlapped with @xmath0 background stars increases to 70%  at the star density of 6000 ( @xmath0 ) stars / deg@xmath7 ( i.e.  a value typical close to the galactic plane ) .",
    "spectral overlap is never complete . even at extreme star densities of 50.000 stars",
    "/ deg@xmath7 only 16%  of the spectra would have an overlapping ( @xmath0 ) spectrum starting within 10 arcsec ( @xmath21 pixels ) behind its head .",
    "spectral tracings in the focal planes of the gaia spectrograph will overlap at all star densities and at all resolutions .",
    "the policy can not and should not be to keep only the spectra that are free from overlaps .",
    "should this be the case one would throw away most of the collected gaia spectra .",
