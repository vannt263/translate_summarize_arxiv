    "we consider the heat equation with random potential on the integer lattice @xmath3 and study the cauchy problem with localised initial condition , @xmath4 u(0,z ) & = & { \\mathbh{1}}_{\\{0\\}}(z ) , \\qquad z\\in{\\mathbb{z}}^d , \\end{array } \\ ] ] where @xmath5 , \\qquad z\\in{\\mathbb{z}}^d , f\\dvtx{\\mathbb{z}}^d\\to{\\mathbb{r}}\\ ] ] is the discrete laplacian , and the potential @xmath6 is a collection of independent identically distributed random variables . the problem ( [ pam ] ) and its variants are often called the _ parabolic anderson model_.    the model originates from the seminal work @xcite of the nobel laureate p.  w. anderson , who used the hamiltonian @xmath7 to describe electron localisation inside a semiconductor , a phenomenon now known as anderson localisation . the parabolic version of the model appears naturally in the context of reaction  diffusion equations ;",
    "see @xcite , describing a system of noninteracting particles diffusing in space according to the laplacian @xmath8 and branching at rate @xmath9 at any given point  @xmath10 .",
    "it turns out that the solution @xmath11 gives the average number of such particles at time @xmath12 at location @xmath10 .",
    "a lot of mathematical attention to the parabolic anderson model over the last 30 years has been due to the fact that it exhibits the _ intermittency effect_. in general , a random model is said to be intermittent if its long - term behaviour can not be described using an averaging principle ; see @xcite . in the context of the parabolic anderson model ,",
    "this means that , for large times @xmath12 , the solution @xmath11 is mainly concentrated on a small number of remote random islands ; see @xcite for a survey .",
    "the long - term behaviour of the parabolic anderson model is determined by the upper tail of the underlying distribution of the potential @xmath0 , and it is believed that the intermittency is more pronounced for heavier tails .",
    "however , an initial approach to understanding intermittency was proposed for light - tailed potentials ( those with finite exponential moments ) .",
    "it was suggested to study large time asymptotics of the moments of the total mass of the solution @xmath13 which are finite for such potentials .",
    "the model was defined as intermittent if higher moments exhibited a faster growth rate , and it was proved in @xcite that the parabolic anderson model is intermittent in this sense .",
    "this method , however , does not work for heavy - tailed potentials ( those with infinite exponential moments ) , as for them the moments of @xmath14 are infinite .",
    "such distributions include the exponential distribution and all heavier - tailed distributions .    in order to understand the intermittent picture in more detail",
    ", it proved to be useful to study various large - time asymptotics of the total mass @xmath14 , as they provided some insight into the geometry of the intermittent islands .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there are four types of behaviour the parabolic anderson model can exhibit depending on the tail of the underlying distribution .",
    "the prime examples from each class are the following distributions :    1 .   weibull distribution with parameter @xmath15 ,",
    "that is , @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   double - exponential distribution with parameter @xmath17 ,",
    "that is , @xmath18 .",
    "`` almost bounded '' distributions , including some unbounded distributions with tails lighter than double - exponential and some bounded distributions .",
    "4 .   other bounded distributions .",
    "the asymptotics of the total mass @xmath14 was studied in @xcite for cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , in @xcite for case ( 3 ) and in @xcite for case ( 4 ) .",
    "heuristics based on the asymptotics of @xmath14 suggests that the intermittent islands will be single lattice points in case ( 1 ) , bounded regions in case ( 2 ) and of size growing to infinity in cases ( 3 ) and  ( 4 ) .",
    "however , a rigorous geometric picture of intermittency has not been well understood .",
    "in particular , it is not clear how many intermittent islands are needed to carry the total mass of the solution , and where those islands are located .",
    "moreover , the four classes above only cover light - tailed potential , and the class of all heavy - tailed distributions should be included to complete the picture .",
    "the prime examples of such distributions are    1 .",
    "pareto distributions , that is , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; 2 .",
    "weibull potentials with parameter @xmath21 .",
    "heavy - tailed potentials were first studied in @xcite , and it turned out that the asymptotics of @xmath14 in this case becomes nondeterministic and difficult to control .",
    "it was suggested to study the nondeterministic nature of @xmath14 using extreme value theory and point processes techniques .",
    "this approach was further developed in @xcite , where the intermittency was fully described in its original geometric sense for pareto potentials ( 0a ) .",
    "polynomial tails are the heaviest tails for which the solution of the parabolic anderson model still exists ( see @xcite ) , and one expected the localisation islands to be small and not numerous .",
    "it was proved that the extreme form of this conjecture is true , namely , that there is only one localisation island consisting of only one site . in other words , at any time the solution is localised at just one point with high probability , a phenomenon called _",
    "complete localisation_.    it is a challenging problem to describe geometric intermittency for lighter tails . in @xcite , intermittent islands were described for potentials from classes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , but the question about the number of islands remained open .",
    "case ( 0b ) was studied in @xcite , and it was shown that the solution is localised on an island of size @xmath22 .",
    "however , it was believed that a much smaller region should actually contribute to the solution .    in this paper , we assume that the potential has _ weibull distribution _ with parameter @xmath23 , that is , the distribution function of each @xmath24 is @xmath25 we focus on @xmath2 , which covers case ( 0b ) and partly case ( 1 ) .",
    "we prove that for such potentials the solution of the parabolic anderson model completely localises at just one single site , exhibiting the strongest form of intermittency similar to the pareto case ( 0a ) .",
    "this was plausible for @xmath26 as in this case the spectral gap of the anderson hamiltonian @xmath7 in a relevant @xmath12-dependent large box tends to infinity , but is quite surprising for the exponential distribution ( @xmath27 ) where the spectral gap is bounded , and even more so for @xmath28 where the spectral gap tends to zero .",
    "we identify the localisation site explicitly in terms of the potential @xmath0 and describe its scaling limit .    for all sufficiently large @xmath12",
    "( so that @xmath29 is well defined ) , denote @xmath30 and let @xmath31 be such that @xmath32 the existence of @xmath31 will be proved in lemma  [ welldef ] .",
    "denote by @xmath33 the @xmath34-norm of @xmath35 , and denote by @xmath36 weak convergence .",
    "[ main_w ] let @xmath2 . as @xmath37 , @xmath38    it is easy to see that the solution can not be localised at one point for all large times @xmath12 since occasionally it has to relocalise continuously from one site to another , and at those periods the solution will be concentrated at more than one point .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for pareto potentials the solution in fact remains localised at just two points at all large times @xmath12 almost surely .",
    "we conjecture that the same is true for weibull potentials with @xmath2 .",
    "there is a chance that our proof could be adjusted to the case .",
    "however , new ideas are required to deal with @xmath39 , and there is a high chance that complete localisation will simply fail in that case .",
    "the technical reasons why our proof breaks down for @xmath40 are explained in remark  [ rem1 ] and remark  [ rem2 ] in sections  [ s_neg ] and  [ s_loc ] , respectively .",
    "[ main_z ] let @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath41 as @xmath37 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is an @xmath44-valued random variable with independent exponentially distributed coordinates with parameter @xmath45 and uniform random signs , that is , with density @xmath46    although we prove theorem  [ main_z ] for all @xmath47 , it only describes the scaling limit for the concentration site for @xmath2 as otherwise the solution may not be localised at @xmath31 .",
    "this scaling limit agrees with the scaling limit for the centre of the intermittent island obtained in @xcite for @xmath48 .",
    "however , according to theorem  [ main_w ] , this island is now of radius zero ( being a single point ) rather than @xmath49 , and the result holds for the wider range @xmath2 .",
    "the notion of _ ageing _ is a key paradigm in studying the long - term dynamics of large disordered systems .",
    "a system exhibits ageing if , being in a certain state at time @xmath12 , it is likely to remain in this state for some time @xmath50 which depends increasingly , and often linearly , on the time @xmath12 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the system becomes increasingly more conservative and reluctant to change .",
    "the ageing phenomenon has been extensively studied for disordered systems such as trap models and spin glasses ; see @xcite and references therein . in the context of the parabolic anderson model , a certain form of ageing based on correlations",
    "was studied for some time - dependent potentials in @xcite , and it was shown that such systems exhibit no ageing . the recent paper @xcite dealt with potentials from class ( 1 ) and studied the correlation ageing ( which gives only indirect information about the evolution of localisation ) and more explicit annealed ageing ( which , in contrast to the quenched setting , is based on the evolution of the islands contributing to the solution averaged over the environment ) .",
    "it was shown that these two forms of ageing are similar , and somewhat surprisingly , ageing was observed for weibull potentials with parameter @xmath39 but not for heavier - tailed weibull potentials with parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the explicit ageing in the quenched setting has so far only been observed for pareto potentials ; see @xcite . in that case , the solution completely localises at just one point and ageing of the parabolic anderson model is equivalent to ageing of the concentration site process . in this paper",
    ", we use a similar approach to show that the parabolic anderson model with weibull potential with parameter @xmath2 exhibits ageing as well . notice that , remarkably , this is in sharp contrast to the absence of annealed and correlation ageing observed for @xmath15 in @xcite",
    ".    for each @xmath52 , denote @xmath53    [ main_a ] let @xmath23 . as @xmath37 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a nondegenerate almost surely positive random variable .    in the proof of theorem  [ main_a ]",
    ", we identify the distribution function of @xmath55 as a certain integral over @xmath56 .",
    "although we prove theorem  [ main_a ] for all @xmath47 , it only characterises the ageing behaviour of the parabolic anderson model for @xmath2 as otherwise the solution may not be localised at @xmath31 .",
    "it follows from @xcite , theorem  2.1 , that the parabolic anderson model with weibull potential possesses a unique nonnegative solution @xmath57 , which has a _",
    "kac representation _ @xmath58,\\qquad ( t , z)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times{\\mathbb{z}}^d,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a continuous - time simple random walk on the lattice @xmath3 with generator",
    "@xmath60 , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the corresponding probability and expectation given that the random walk starts at @xmath63 . the feynman ",
    "kac formula suggests that the main contribution to the solution @xmath64 at time @xmath12 comes from paths @xmath65 spending a lot of time at sites @xmath10 where the value @xmath66 of the potential is high but which are reasonably close to the origin so that the random walk would have a fair chance of reaching them in time @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that the functional @xmath67 defined in ( [ phi ] ) captures this trade - off , being the difference of the energetic term @xmath24 and an entropic term responsible for the cost of going to a point @xmath10 in time @xmath12 and staying there .",
    "furthermore , the maximiser @xmath31 of @xmath67 turns out to be the site where the solution @xmath64 is localised at time @xmath12 .    in order to prove this",
    ", we decompose the solution @xmath64 into the sum @xmath68 according to two groups of paths ending at @xmath10 :    a.   paths visiting @xmath31 before time @xmath12 and staying in the ball @xmath69 centred in the origin with radius @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a certain function tending to zero ; b.   all other paths .",
    "we show that @xmath72 localises around @xmath31 and that the total mass of @xmath73 is negligible .",
    "to prove the localisation of @xmath72 , we use spectral analysis of the anderson hamiltonian @xmath7 in the ball @xmath69 . in order to do so ,",
    "we show that , although the spectral gap tends to zero for @xmath15 , it is still reasonably large .",
    "we suggest a new technique which allows us to show that the principal eigenfunction just manages to localise at @xmath31 .",
    "then we use a result from @xcite to show that this is sufficient for the localisation of @xmath72 .    in order to prove that the total mass of @xmath73 is negligible",
    ", we notice that the paths from the second group fall into one of the following three subgroups :    1 .",
    "paths having the maximum of the potential at the point @xmath31 but making more than @xmath70 steps ; 2 .   paths having the maximum of the potential not at the point @xmath31 , with the maximum being reasonably large ; 3 .",
    "paths missing all high values of the potential .    in section  [ s_neg ] , we show that the total mass of the paths corresponding to each group is negligible . in all cases , this is due to an imbalance between the energetic forces ( which do not contribute enough if the site @xmath31 is not visited ) and entropic forces ( as the probabilistic cost is too high if a path is too long ) , as well as to the fact that the gap between @xmath74 and the second largest value of @xmath67 is too large .",

    "for sufficiently large @xmath12 , we denote @xmath78 further , for all @xmath63 and all sufficiently large @xmath12 , we denote @xmath79 where @xmath80 is defined by ( [ rrr ] ) , and define a point process @xmath81 where we write @xmath82 for the dirac measure in @xmath83 . in section",
    "[ s_ppp ] , we show that the point processes @xmath84 are well defined on a carefully chosen domain , and that they converge in law to a poisson point process with certain density .",
    "this allows us to analyse the joint distribution of the random variables @xmath31 , @xmath75 , @xmath74 , @xmath85 and , in particular , prove theorem  [ main_z ] .",
    "finally , to prove ageing , we argue that due to the form of the functional @xmath67 the probability of @xmath86 , for each @xmath87 , is roughly equal to @xmath88 where @xmath89 \\\\[-8pt ] & & { } \\cup \\bigl({\\mathbb{r}}^d\\times[y,\\infty ) \\bigr ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath90 in particular , the integral in ( [ inti ] ) converges to the corresponding finite integral with respect to the poisson point process @xmath91 as @xmath37 .",
    "this proves theorem  [ main_a ] since that integral is a continuous function of @xmath92 decreasing from one to zero as @xmath92 varies from zero to infinity and so it is the tail of a distribution function .",

    "finally , in section  [ s_age ] , we study ageing and prove theorem  [ main_a ] .",
    "we focus on potentials with weibull distribution ( [ wei ] ) with parameter @xmath2 .",
    "however , most of our point processes results can be obtained for all @xmath23 at no additional cost .",
    "therefore , we will assume @xmath23 in sections  [ s_pre ] , [ s_ppp ] and  [ s_age ] , and restrict ourselves to the case @xmath2 in sections  [ s_neg ] and  [ s_loc ] .",
