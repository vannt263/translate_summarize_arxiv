    "the analysis and the control of numerical error in discretized propagation - type equations is of major importance for both theoretical analysis and practical applications .",
    "a huge amount of works has been devoted to the analysis of the numerical errors , its dynamics and its influence on the computed solution ( the reader is referred to classical books , among which @xcite ) .",
    "the emergence of _ dispersion - relation - preserving ( drp ) _ schemes @xcite ) , which have the same dispersion relation as the original partial difference equations , enables one to have very accurate high order finite difference schemes . +",
    "the two sources of numerical error are the dispersive and dissipative properties of the numerical scheme , which are very often investigated in unbounded or periodic domains thanks to a spectral analysis .",
    "+ it appears that existing works are mostly devoted to linear , one - dimensional numerical models , such as the linear advection equation    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a constant uniform advection velocity .",
    "the two sources of numerical error are the dispersive and dissipative properties of the numerical scheme , which are very often investigated in unbounded or periodic domains thanks to a spectral analysis . following this approach ,",
    "a monochromatic wave is used to measure the accuracy of the scheme .",
    "such a tool is very powerful and provides the user with a deep insight into the discretization errors .",
    "but some results coming from practical numerical experiments still remain unexplained , despite the linear character of the discrete numerical model . as an example , let us note the sudden growth of the numerical error for long range propagation reported by zingg @xcite for a large set of numerical schemes , including optimized numerical schemes .",
    "the usual modal analysis is almost always applied to monochromatic reference solutions , with the purpose of analyzing the error committed on both their amplitude and their phase , leading to classical plots of the relative error as the function of the courant number and/or the number of grid points per wavelength .",
    "therefore , dispersive phenomena associated to polychromatic solutions are usually not taken into account . + the present paper deals with the analysis of linear dispersive mechanism which results in local error focusing , i.e. to a sudden local error burst in the @xmath0 norm for polychromatic solutions .",
    "this phenomena is reminiscent of the physical one referred to as the caustic phenomenon in linear dispersive physical models @xcite , and will be referred to as the spurious caustic phenomenon hereafter .",
    "it extends our previous work @xcite to _ drp _ schemes .",
    "the present analysis is restricted to interior stencil , and the influence of boundary conditions will not be considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "main elements of caustic theory of interest for the present analysis are recalled in section [ caustiques ] .",

    "is taken under the form :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the complex phase , and @xmath5 the real wave number . for dispersive waves",
    ", it is recalled that the group velocity @xmath6 is defined as    @xmath7    a caustic is defined as a focusing of different rays in a single location .",
    "the equivalent condition is that the group velocity exhibits an extremum , i.e. there exists at least one wave number @xmath8 such that    @xmath9    the corresponding physical interpretation is that wave packets with characteristic wave numbers close to @xmath8 will pile - up after a finite time and will remain superimposed for a long time , resulting in the existence a region of high energy followed by a region with very low fluctuation level .",
    "the linear continuous model eq .",
    "( [ transp ] ) is not dispersive if the convection velocity @xmath2 is uniform , and therefore the exact solution does not exhibits caustics since the group velocity does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the discrete solution associated with a given numerical scheme will admit spurious caustics , and therefore spurious local energy pile - up and local sudden growth of the error , if the discrete dispersion relation is such that the condition ( [ eq : caustic ] ) is satisfied .",
    "for a uniform scale - dependent convection velocity , such spurious caustics can exist in polychromatic solutions only , since they are associated to the superposition of wave packets with different characteristic wave numbers .",
    "+ set :    @xmath10    the general dispersion relation associated with the discrete scheme enables us to obtain the corresponding group velocity , given by :    @xmath11    the numerical solution will therefore admits spurious caustics if    @xmath12    the corresponding values of @xmath13 and @xmath5 will be respectively denoted @xmath14 and @xmath8 .",
    "spurious caustics are associated with characteristic lines given by    @xmath15    where    @xmath16",
    "the burgers equation :    @xmath17    @xmath2 , @xmath18 being real constants , plays a crucial role in the history of wave equations .",

    "+ the courant - friedrichs - lewy number ( @xmath30 ) is defined as @xmath31 . + a numerical scheme is specified by selecting appropriate values of the coefficients @xmath27 . then , depending on them , one can obtain optimum schemes , for which the error will be minimal .",
