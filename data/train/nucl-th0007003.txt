    "according to the fundamental theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) , normal nuclear matter is expected to undergo a phase transition to deconfined quarks and gluons when its density and/or temperature are high @xcite .",
    "to produce such a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in the laboratory , experiments involving collisions of nuclei at relativistic energies have been carried out at the cern sps @xcite .",
    "possible evidences for the production of this new phase of matter have recently been announced @xcite .",
    "further experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , which allows collisions at much high energies than those available previously , are expected to provide a better opportunity to create the quark - gluon plasma and to study its properties .    since",
    "quarks and gluons can not be directly detected in experiments , many indirect observables have been proposed as possible signatures for the qgp .",
    "these include : enhanced production of strange hadrons as a result of the short strangeness equilibration time in qgp @xcite , suppression of @xmath0 production due to color screening in qgp @xcite , quenching of high @xmath1 jets due to passage through the qgp @xcite , and enhancement of low mass dileptons as a result of medium modifications of hadron properties in high density matter @xcite .",
    "although all these signals have been observed in heavy ion collisions at cern sps , alternative explanations without invoking the formation of the quark - gluon plasma have also been proposed . as the qgp",
    "is expected to be produced at rhic , it is of interest to study these signatures in heavy ion collisions at such high energies . since the quark - gluon plasma has a finite size , exists for a finite time , and may not be in equilibrium , it is important to use a dynamical model to take into account these effects . using the parton cascade model @xcite , satz and srivastava @xcite",
    "have recently studied the time evolution of the density profile of the parton system in these collisions and demonstrated the possibility of using a dynamical model to study the onset of deconfinement and its effect on quarkonium suppression . in this paper",
    ", we shall investigate explicitly @xmath0 suppression in central nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic energies using a multiphase transport model ( ampt ) @xcite .",
    "since the ampt model includes both initial partonic and final hadronic interactions as well as the transition between these two phases of matter , it allows us to study the relative importance of the partonic and hadronic effects on @xmath0 suppression .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ ampt ]",
    ", we briefly describe the ampt model for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and its extension to include @xmath0 production .",
    "the mechanisms for @xmath0 suppression are given in section [ absorption ] .",
    "results for au+au and s+s collisions at rhic are given in section [ results ] .",
    "first , we show the time evolution of the particle number and energy densities in both the partonic and hadronic matters .",
    "this is then followed by the time evolution of various @xmath0 suppression effects and the @xmath0 survival probability .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section [ summary ] .",
    "in the ampt model , the initial conditions are obtained from the minijets generated by the heavy ion jet interaction generator ( hijing ) @xcite by using a woods - saxon radial shape for the colliding nuclei and including the nuclear shadowing effect on partons via the gluon recombination mechanism by mueller - qiu @xcite .",
    "after the passage of the colliding nuclei , the gyulassy - wang model @xcite is then used to generate the initial space - time information of partons .",
    "the subsequent time evolution of the parton phase - space distribution is modeled by the zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) @xcite , which at present includes only the gluon elastic scattering .",
    "after partons stop interacting , the lund string fragmentation model @xcite is used to convert them into hadrons .",
    "the dynamics of resulting hadronic matter is described by a relativistic transport model ( art ) @xcite .",
    "details of the ampt model can be found in @xcite .    to include @xmath0 in the ampt model , we use the perturbative approach @xcite as",
    "its production probability is small in heavy ion collisions .",
    "specifically , the reaction @xmath2 is selected from the pythia program whenever there is an inelastic scattering between projectile and target nucleons . instead of allowing the produced @xmath0 to undergo multiple interactions , fragmentation , and decay in the pythia",
    ", its momentum is stored in a file and read into hijing .",
    "the transverse position of the @xmath0 is determined by propagating it to the time of formation from the average transverse position of the colliding projectile and target nucleons . since the @xmath0 production probability is increased from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , each @xmath0 is given a probability of @xmath5 in order to have the correct number in an event , given by the total probability of all @xmath0 s .",
    "the @xmath0 formation time is taken to be 0.5 fm/@xmath6 , which is suggested by the virtuality argument of kharzeev and satz @xcite and is also consistent with the uncertainty principle used for estimating the lifetime of an expanding @xmath7 @xcite . before this time , the @xmath8 pair is considered a precursor @xmath0 .",
    "after a pair of @xmath8 is produced in the initial collisions , whether it can materialize as a @xmath0 depends on its interactions in the initial partonic and final hadronic matters . in the partonic matter , the @xmath8 pair , which are initially close in phase space and would normally form a @xmath0 after the formation time of 0.5 fm/@xmath6 , will move beyond the confinement distance of @xmath0 and become unbound if the plasma screening remains strong @xcite .",
    "they will later combine with the more abundant light quarks to form instead the charm hadrons when the parton density is low .",
    "the critical density for the plasma screening to be effective can be estimated using @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the critical debye screening mass , @xmath11 is the qcd coupling constant , and @xmath12 is the slope parameter of the transverse momentum distribution . using @xmath13 gev , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 gev ,",
    "one obtains a critical density of @xmath16 @xmath17 . following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , we first determine from the ampt model the time evolution of the radius of the volume in which the parton density is above the critical density .",
    "a @xmath0 is thus not formed from the @xmath8 pair if its radial position after the formation time of 0.5 fm/@xmath6 is within the critical radius at that time .    besides dissociation due to plasma screening , a @xmath0 may also be dissociated by collisions with gluons in the partonic matter @xcite .",
    "the cross section for @xmath18 has been estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite to be 3 mb .",
    "similarly , a precursor @xmath0 can also be dissociated by gluon scattering .",
    "the cross section is expected to be smaller as its size is smaller than a physical @xmath0 . in the present study , we ignore the difference between the scattering of a gluon with precursor and physical @xmath0 , and use the same cross section .",
    "since this cross section is not well - known , we have also used a value of @xmath19 mb in the following study .    in the hadronic matter following the parton stage ,",
    "a @xmath0 can be further destroyed by collisions with hadrons .",
    "the @xmath0 absorption cross section by baryons is taken to be 6 mb @xcite while that by meson is taken to be 3 mb @xcite above their respective thresholds .",
    "although earlier studies based on the perturbative qcd @xcite and simple hadronic model @xcite give a much smaller @xmath0 absorption cross sections by hadrons , the above values are consistent with recent studies using the quark - interchange model @xcite and the more complete hadronic model @xcite . using these cross sections in the transport model , it has been found that the observed suppression of @xmath0 production in heavy ion collisions at the sps energies can be reasonably described except for the most central collisions @xcite . as the formation time of @xmath0 is comparable to the passing time ( @xmath20 fm/@xmath6 ) of two colliding nuclei at rhic energies , @xmath0 absorption by the projectile and target nucleons",
    "is not expected to be important @xcite and will be ignored in the present study .",
    "we note that as the @xmath0 is treated perturbatively in the simulation , the momenta of other hadrons are not affected by their interactions with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ fig : auauden5 ] , we show the time evolution of the particle number and energy densities of partons and hadrons in central au+au collisions at @xmath21 gev .",
    "they are the densities in the central cell , which has a transverse radius of 1 fm for partons and 2 fm for hadrons .",
    "the longitudinal dimension of the central cell is taken to be @xmath22 of the time @xmath23 , which is equivalent to taking the central space - time rapidity cell .",
    "the results are not significantly changed if @xmath24 of the time is used for the longitudinal dimension .",
    "we see that the initial parton density is about @xmath25 @xmath17 and is much higher than the @xmath0 dissociation critical density ( about @xmath26 @xmath17 ) given above .",
    "the time evolution of these densities is seen to deviate from that based on the ideal bjorken boost invariant scenario @xcite , which would lead to a linear curve on the log - log plot .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the more realistic treatment of initial collisions by using the the gyulassy - wang model for the formation time and the presence of radial flow as well as a gradual freeze - out @xcite at the later hadronic stage . from the ratio of the parton energy density to its number density",
    ", one sees that the average energy of a parton is more than @xmath19 gev .",
    "the parton stage lasts about @xmath27 fm/@xmath6 , while the hadron stage starts gradually at around @xmath28 fm/@xmath6 and lasts until about @xmath29 fm/@xmath6 .",
    "the average energy of a hadron is less than @xmath19 gev , since the central rapidity is dominated by mesons instead of baryons in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssden9 ] , we show the results for central collisions of s+s at @xmath21 agev . due to the smaller size of the system comparing to that of au+au collisions , the plasma lifetime is shorter , i.e. , about @xmath30 fm/@xmath6 , and the hadron stage sets in at about @xmath27 fm/@xmath6 .",
    "we note that even in the smaller parton system produced in s+s collisions , the initial density is much higher than the critical density for @xmath0 dissociation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : auaurho4c ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ssrho4a6 ] , we show , respectively , the parton density in central au+au and s+s collisions at different times . as minijet gluons are produced from initial hard collisions , their densities at different radii reflect the number of initial binary nucleon - nucleon collisions . as seen from the figure , they are different from the initial nuclear density distribution given by a woods - saxon form .",
    "as expected , both the size and lifetime of the partonic matter produced in s+s collisions are smaller than those in au+au collisions . from the time evolution of the parton density",
    ", one can determine the time evolution of the critical radius for @xmath0 dissociation , and this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : auaurhoc3 ] by full dots for au+au collisions and open dots for s+s collisions .",
    "the solid lines are polynomial fits to the above results using the form , @xmath31 for @xmath32 , with @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath36 . for the partonic matter produced in au+au collisions , we have @xmath37 fm/@xmath6 , @xmath38 fm/@xmath6 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . for s+s collisions , they are @xmath43 fm/@xmath6 , @xmath44 fm/@xmath6 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . in au+au collisions ,",
    "the critical radius for @xmath0 dissociation extracted from our model is about 6 fm at beginning of the parton cascade and vanishes after about 1.2 fm/@xmath6 .",
    "the critical radius is reduced to about 2 fm initially and vanishes after only about 0.5 fm in s+s collisions .",
    "since the duration of the partonic matter that is above the critical density for @xmath0 dissociation is shorter than the @xmath0 formation time , @xmath0 suppression due to plasma screening is therefore unimportant in central s+s collisions .      including the above three mechanisms for @xmath0 suppression in the ampt model",
    ", we have evaluated the @xmath0 survival probability in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob2a ] , we show for central au+au collisions the time evolution of the @xmath0 formation probability @xmath49 , the @xmath0 absorption probability @xmath50 by gluon scattering , the @xmath0 dissociation probability @xmath51 by plasma screening , the @xmath0 absorption probability @xmath52 by hadrons , and the @xmath0 survival probability @xmath53 .",
    "the results are taken for the @xmath0 produced in the central rapidity interval @xmath54 .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath0 formation probability increases quickly with time and about @xmath55 of the @xmath0 are formed by @xmath56 fm/@xmath6 .",
    "absorption by gluons starts very early in the process and ends at about @xmath19 fm/@xmath6 after dissociation due to plasma screening begins .",
    "the latter also ends at about @xmath19 fm/@xmath6 .",
    "both dissociation due to plasma screening and absorption by gluon collisions give comparable contributions , accounting for the suppression of about 90% of the @xmath0 , while absorption by hadrons contributes only about a few percent .",
    "the final @xmath0 survivability is about 6% .",
    "the results for the case without plasma screening is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob2b ] .",
    "comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig : prob2a ] , we see that the @xmath0 absorption probability by gluons is similar for time up to @xmath56 fm/@xmath6 , but it lasts longer until @xmath27 fm/@xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that there is a competition between @xmath0 suppression due to gluon scattering and plasma screening , i.e. , some @xmath0 s that are destroyed by collisions with gluons would have been dissociated by plasma screening if they are not allowed to scatter with gluons .",
    "[ fig : prob2c ] shows the results without @xmath0 absorption by gluon scattering . in this case , the plasma dissociation probability saturates quickly .",
    "compared to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob2b ] , the @xmath0 suppression probability is seen to start late but saturate early .",
    "this difference in the survival probability may be seen by studying the azimuthal distribution of final survival @xmath0 in mid - central collisions .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath0 suppression during the parton stage is similar whether when both plasma screening and gluon scattering are present or when only one of them is present .",
    "the effect of reducing the @xmath0 scattering cross section by gluon is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob2d ] . compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : prob2a ] , we see that the decrease in the contribution from gluon scattering is partly compensated by the plasma screening .    in table",
    "[ table : auauprob ] , we summarize the final absorption probabilities due to gluons ( @xmath57 ) , hadrons ( @xmath58 ) , plasma dissociation ( @xmath59 ) , and the survival probability ( @xmath60 ) in central au+au collisions .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath0 survival probability after the parton stage , @xmath61 , is about 9% and 17% for @xmath62 3 mb and 1 mb , respectively .",
    "the parton stage thus has a large effect on @xmath0 suppression in heavy ion collisions at rhic . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath0 suppression factor in the hadron stage is @xmath63 .",
    "depending on the different assumptions on the mechanisms for @xmath0 suppression , the final survival probability can range from about @xmath64 to about @xmath65 .",
    "this indicates that finite size effects may be important in @xmath0 suppression at rhic energies .",
    "we have also studied @xmath0 suppression in s+s collisions at rhic energies , and the results are summarized in table [ table : ssprob ] . as expected from the discussion of fig . [",
    "fig : auaurhoc3 ] , there is no contribution from plasma screening in collisions of such light system , although the initial density is above the critical density . as a result , the @xmath0 has an appreciable survival probability ( about 50% ) after absorption by gluons and hadrons .",
    "since @xmath0 absorption by gluon scattering still contributes appreciably to the final @xmath0 suppression , it may provide an opportunity for studying this mechanism .",

    "@xmath0 suppression in heavy ion collisions between light nuclei thus provides a possible opportunity for studying the interactions between @xmath0 and gluon .    in our study ,",
    "we have ignored both @xmath0 formation from the recombination of @xmath8 pairs during hadronization and @xmath0 production from charm mesons in the final hadronic matter . the number of @xmath0 formed from charm quarks during hadronization can be roughly estimated from considerations of the phase space and the spin and color factors . at the end of parton stage ,",
    "the volume of the partonic matter in the central unit of rapidity is approximately given by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the transverse radius and longitudinal dimension , respectively .",
    "for au+au collisions , they are @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the probability that an anticharm quark is found within a distance of the @xmath0 radius from a charm quark",

    "one obtains the probability @xmath78 . in order for this charm pair to form a @xmath0",
    ", their spins must be parallel and their total color should be neutral .",
    "this reduces the probability by the factor @xmath79 . requiring that the charm pair has a relative momentum distribution within @xmath80 gev at @xmath81 mev further suppresss the probability by a factor of 0.29 .",
    "since there are about 1.5 charm pairs per unit rapidity per central au+au collision at rhic , the number of @xmath0 formed from their recombination is about @xmath82 , which is much smaller than the expected number of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath83 . in the above ,",
    "the factor 40 is the ratio of charm to @xmath0 production in initial hard collisions @xcite and the factor 0.061 is the final @xmath0 survival probability from table [ table : auauprob ] . as to @xmath0 production from charm mesons in hadronic matter",
    ", it has been shown to be insignificant in heavy ion collisions at rhic , although it may not be negligible at lhc @xcite .",
    "we have not included the effect due to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which are also produced in initial collisions and can decay to @xmath0 . since these particles are less bound than @xmath0 , they are more likely to be dissociated and absorbed in both the quark - gluon plasma and the hadronic matter . as a result ,",
    "inclusion of @xmath86 and @xmath85 is expected to lead to a smaller number of @xmath0 than predicted in the present study .",
