    "maldacena s ads / cft correspondence @xcite has helped us disentangle strongly coupled dynamics of field theories by considering their dual via the correspondence . generally , strongly coupled regimes of strongly interacting field theories can be described using classical einstein gravity , reducing the problem to one which can be described using geometry .",
    "also , considerations of strongly coupled field theories in different backgrounds can be studied simply by adding the same background in the gravity picture . specifically to our interest , we study the effects of a background magnetic field on the strongly coupled dynamics .",
    "ads / cft systems with background magnetic fields have already been studied in the context of describing @xmath6 gauge theories in magnetic fields @xcite using magnetic branes in ads@xmath1 .",
    "the ads@xmath7 case has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we consider a new case of the ads@xmath1 duality which exhibits exotic phenomena that can help shed more light on the physics of the duality .",
    "another aim is to understand the version of the duality in two dimensions , namely the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath8 case .",
    "surprisingly , this version is the least understood @xcite .",
    "further interest in this duality stems from the emergence of quantum critical behavior , namely non - fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "we thus present a setup in which the ads@xmath0 picture becomes relevant .    in this paper",
    "we construct a bulk solution with a background magnetic field that interpolates between ads@xmath1 in the uv to ads@xmath9t@xmath10 in the ir .",
    "we consider the gravity description by starting with m theory in 11 dimensions .",
    "we consider a stack of m2 branes sitting on an ade singularity @xcite . upon dimensional reduction , this system is equivalent to d2 branes localized within d6 branes probed near the the core of the d6 branes @xcite .",
    "we work in the regime @xmath11 where the supergravity limit is valid @xcite . in the low energy limit of the 11 dimensional theory ,",
    "one obtains the space ads@xmath12/@xmath13 .",
    "the magnetic field we consider is obtained by switching on the kaluza - klein gauge fields of the @xmath3 .",
    "we consider first the case of gauging the diagonal @xmath14 of the @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "we solve the system exactly and obtain an interpolating solution for all @xmath16 .",
    "we find at small @xmath16 a product of a two dimensional black hole and an @xmath5 .",
    "this black hole being extremal gives us a finite entropy at zero temperature which tells us that the strongly coupled field theory contains a degenerate ground state at strong coupling .",
    "we further investigate the supergravity in ads@xmath1 for the general embeddings of @xmath14 in @xmath15 to find the conditions for supersymmetric solutions .",
    "we find , by setting appropriate variations to zero , that we are left with two real supersymmetries for the appropriate choice of @xmath14 s .",
    "this feature is important as it ensures stability , which is a property usually not found in systems used to describe condensed matter systems .",
    "we also study the effects of the orbifold and magnetic fields on the dual field theory of the m2 brane system .",
    "this dual field theory at low coupling is given by 2 + 1 @xmath17 sym .",
    "we view the field theory through the iia picture using the d2-d6 system .",
    "we find that the defining representations of @xmath15 containing the scalars and fermions break as @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "we discus how these particles are charged under the @xmath20 magnetic fields . also , we discuss that the considered compactification which takes one from m - theory to iia theory taken along the orbifolded direction results in a ramond - ramond background field which sources d2-d6 .",
    "however , we argue that d2-d6 states can be ignored in this case since we are considering the limit @xmath21 . with this particle content",
    "we calculate the entropy of the system and find that it is also finite at zero temperature .",
    "this is a novel feature of the system in consideration where we have a description of the field theory that contains a degenerate ground state in both limits of the coupling .",
    "however , we find that the entropies are different in the two limits .",
    "we therefore expect that the degenerate states lift up from the zero level once the coupling is turned on , only to recombine in the infinite coupling limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin in section 2 with the general magnetic m2 brane system and obtain interpolating solutions between ads@xmath1 and ads@xmath0@xmath2@xmath5 . in section 3 we look for the conditions that determine the class of supersymmetric solutions from the previous section .",
    "we proceed then in section 4 to discuss the field theory dual to this bulk and thereby calculate the resulting entropy from the field content .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in section 5 by comparing the entropies across the duality .",
    "the main results in the present paper were reported in @xcite . as we were completing this paper we received @xcite , which rederives and extends them .",
    "in this section we look for solutions that interpolate between ads@xmath1 at high energies and ads@xmath0@xmath2@xmath5 at low energies with a constant magnetic field . we obtain this as the truncated bulk theory outside a stack of m2 branes subjected to a constant magnetic field .",
    "in particular the system we are considering arises from reducing the @xmath3 of the supergravity limit of m theory on the ads@xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 vacuum .",
    "this gives rise to @xmath15 gauged @xmath22 supergravity in four dimensions . in our case , we are interested in an abelian gauging of @xmath15 , which under an appropriate rotation amounts to gauging the four @xmath14 s of @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in orbifolding one of the dimensions of the @xmath3 , which amounts to placing the m2 branes on an ade singularity , the @xmath23 orbifold singularity .",
    "as shown in @xcite , compactifying on the orbifold direction gives rise to a d2-d6 system that exhibits a very rich phase structure as a function on the brane content , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the number of m2 branes .",
    "the truncation ansatz of @xmath15 gauged @xmath22 supergravity is @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . placing the m2 branes on the @xmath23 orbifold singularity considered amounts to orbifolding on two planes of the @xmath3 : @xmath31 in the d2-d6 picture these two planes",
    "are reduced to three dimensions and are orthogonal to the d2 and d6 branes . under this action",
    "we write the metric anstaz as , @xmath32 where @xmath33 the truncated lagrangian for this system has the form , @xmath34 where the @xmath35 s are four scalars that parameterize a set of deformations of the @xmath3 and satisfy @xmath36 .",
    "the gauge fields are the result of kaluza kleining the @xmath3 directions and the @xmath37 s determine the embedding of the @xmath14 s in @xmath15 via @xmath38 .",
    "the scalar field equation of motion is given by , @xmath39 where @xmath40 we proceed now to find gravity solutions .",
    "our target is to obtain a spacetime which at low energies becomes ads@xmath41t@xmath10 .",
    "thus we are looking for solutions which interpolate between this spacetime at low energies and ads@xmath1 at high energies .",
    "we consider the magnetic field to be tangent to the boundary directions .",
    "we also assume lorentz invariance in the boundary directions . with these conditions ,",
    "the metric ansatz takes the form @xmath42 the maxwell stress tensor is given by @xmath43 the field equations that follow are @xmath44 where @xmath45@xmath46 now we can solve for the resulting spacetimes in the uv and ir .",
    "we are looking for solutions that represent fixed points in those two limits , thus at each limit we take the scalars to be constant and solve for them using ( [ xmotion ] ) . generally the @xmath47 s will vary with @xmath16 and will not attain the same value in the uv as in the ir .",
    "however , we find that for the specific embedding of @xmath48 the @xmath47 s are constant in @xmath16 and @xmath49 .",
    "in fact we find that this is the only case where the scalars have a constant profile for all @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , an analytic solution to einstein s equations can be found for all @xmath16 in this special setup .",
    "however , we focus on the general case for the time being .",
    "we start by looking for an ads@xmath1 solution in the uv . in this limit",
    ", the contribution from the magnetic field is suppressed as @xmath50 and can be ignored in einstein s equations and the scalar equations of motion .",
    "the resulting solution for the scalars is @xmath49 and the spacetime is given by , @xmath51 fitting this into the ansatz ( [ kk ] ) the full metric of the orbifolded m2 system in the uv is , @xmath52 where the @xmath3 radius , @xmath53 , given in string theory parameters is , @xmath54^{1/6}\\ ] ] next , we look at the system in the ir .",
    "we can not disregard the magnetic field anymore and we look for its effect on the ir geometry . in this limit the scalar equations of motion ( [ xmotion ] ) take on the form , @xmath55 along with the cyclic permutations of @xmath56 . using these equations",
    "one can solve for the scalars , @xmath35 , in terms of the charges , @xmath57 . moving on the gravitational solutions ,",
    "einstein s equations produce the spacetime , @xmath58 this is the desired ads@xmath41r@xmath10 solution .",
    "we see that the magnetic field gives a minimum size of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 directions as the endpoint of the flow from the uv to the ir",
    ". we do not present interpolating solutions for all @xmath16 .",
    "those can be solved for numerically for general @xmath14 embeddings and analytically for the symmetric case of @xmath61 .",

    "this can be done by shifting the radius by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the location of the horizon .",
    "the metric becomes , @xmath64 we now fit this ads@xmath0 blackhole into the 11 dimensional picture .",

    "this is promising as this supersymmetry guarantees stability of this solution relieving the system from the main problems with such configurations that are dual to interesting condensed matter systems .",
    "in this section we investigate the properties of the field theory dual to the stack of m2 branes with the considered orbifold . as discussed in @xcite , the dual field theory of a stack of m2 branes",

    "alternatively we can study the field content from the d2-d6 picture .",
    "the particle content that we consider is that which corresponds to string states stretched between the d2s .",
    "since the geometric picture is only valid in the limit @xmath11 @xcite , string states stretched between d2 and d6 branes are few in comparison and thus do not contribute significantly to the entropy . also , the field theory d2-d6 states is modified by the emergence of a background rr field which originates from kaluza kleining on the orbifolded m - theory direction . this field sources d2-d6 string states which partially fill the landau levels .",
    "we conclude however that this does not alter our assertion that the d2-d6 states are still few in number and can be ignored in the limit of interest .",
    "the full r - symmetry group of 2 + 1 @xmath17 sym is @xmath15 .",

    "the field theory contains scalars @xmath142 in the @xmath139 and fermions @xmath143 in the @xmath140 . to obtain the particle content of the system after the dimensional reduction on the m - theory direction , or the orbifold direction , we need to construct the states which are invariant under the orbifold action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "singling out the orbifold planes breaks the full @xmath15 symmetry into @xmath144 , where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are with respect to the four d6 dimensions orthogonal to the d2 .",
    "as for the orbifold action itself , it further breaks this into @xmath147@xmath2@xmath148@xmath2@xmath149@xmath2@xmath150 where the @xmath14 gauges the m - theory direction to be reduced on .",

    "the entropy of the system is completely goverened by the lll states we can fit into the system . for the fermions we expect the entropy @xmath175 because the number of possible states is two ; either having no fermions or one fermion ( the one with the appropriate spin alignment ) , and by pauli exclusion , we ca nt fit anymore fermions of zero energy . moving on the case of the bosons",

    "we construct the ratio , @xmath181 and plot the function @xmath182 for the different orbifolding considered .",

    "this leads one to expect that the degeneracy lifts once interactions are turned on only to recombine once again at large enough coupling .    as described in @xcite , the geometric description in only valid in the limit of @xmath11 due to the minimization of curvature tensors . by varying @xmath25 under this limit",
    ", we can go between the m - theory picture for @xmath184 and the iia picture for @xmath185 which corresponds to the d2-d6 system considered .",
    "the field theory picture is valid in the limit where @xmath186 .",

    "for @xmath195 the theory flows to its strongly coupled ir fixed point before the @xmath188 field becomes significant , and so the gravity description is accurate . at first glance",
    "it would seem that comparing the entropy between those two systems should not be justified since the @xmath188 fields in the two regimes have completely different magnitudes .",
    "however , we conclude that this is not an issue since we imagine that the magnetic field is changed adiabatically between the two limits , and this adiabatic change should not modify the entropy .",
    "this is summarized in figure 2 .",
    "in this paper we considered a system that can shed some light on the duality in two dimensions . by switching on a magnetic field in an m2 brane",

    "we also found that we can go between descriptions , be it d2-d6 branes or m - theory by adjusting the ratio @xmath196 .",
    "we compared the entropy of the magnetic system across the duality and found the striking feature that both were finite at zero temperature .",
    "the entropies had different scaling dependence on the number of branes : @xmath197 for the gravity side and @xmath198 for the field theory .",
    "regardless of the mismatch , this nonvanishing entropy presents an interesting question as to how the states move from the degeneracies in the two limits , and since the interactions , once turned on , are bound to remove this degeneracy this result shows that at large coupling some mechanism should recombine the states to have a nonvanishing zero temperature entropy .",
