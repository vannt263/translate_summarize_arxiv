    "jones ( 1976 ) studied the propagation of light in a moving dielectric and showed by experiment that a rotating medium induces a rotation of the polarisation of the transmitted light . player ( 1976 ) confirmed that this observation could be accounted for through an application of maxwells equations in a moving medium . more recently",
    "padgett _ et al . _",
    "( 2006 ) reasoned that the rotation of the medium turns a transmitted image by the same angle as the polarisation .",
    "this is in contrast to the faraday effect ( faraday 1846 ) , where a static magnetic field in a dielectric medium , parallel to the propagation of light , causes a rotation of the polarisation but not a rotation of a transmitted image .",
    "rotation of the plane of polarisation and image rotation in a rotating medium may be attributed respectively to the spin and orbital angular momentum of light ( allen _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "the first theoretical treatment of this problem was published by fermi ( 1923 ) , who considered plane waves and a non - dispersive medium .",
    "the theoretical analysis of player ( 1976 ) was also restricted to the propagation of plane waves , but took the dispersion of the medium into account .",
    "player assumed that the dielectric response does not depend on the motion of the medium . in our treatment",
    "we follow his assumption although a more careful analysis by nienhuis _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) showed that there will be an effect of the motion on the refractive index for a dispersive medium near to an absorption resonance ( see also baranova & zeldovich ( 1979 ) for a discussion on the effect of the coriolis force on the refractive index ) .",
    "in contrast to player we allow for more general electromagnetic fields that can carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "this leads to an additional term in our wave equation , which corresponds to a fresnel drag term familiar from analysis of uniform motion . for a rotating medium , however",
    ", this drag leads to a rotational shift of the image .",
    "the propagation of light in a rotating medium thus involves both spin angular momentum ( sam ) and oam .",
    "we solve the wave equation for circularly polarised bessel beams and consider two different superpositions of such bessel beams to quantify the effects of both polarisation and image rotation .",
    "for rotation of the polarisation we examine a superposition of left- and right - circularly polarised bessel beams carrying the same amount of oam . for image rotation",
    "we consider a superposition of bessel beams with the same circular polarisation but opposite oam values .",
    "such a superposition creates an intensity pattern with lobes or ` petals ' . in both cases the constituent bessel beams",
    "propagate differently in the medium , which leads to a change in their relative phase .",
    "this is the origin of the rotation of both the polarisation and the transmitted image . for both phenomena",
    "we derive an expression for the angle per unit length of dielectric through which the image or the polarisation is rotated .",
    "the significance of the total angular momentum can be most easily seen in the wave equation for the propagation of light in a rotating medium .",
    "we derive this wave equation in section [ sec : waveeq ] . in the remaining sections we calculate the rotation of polarisation ( section [ sec : polrot ] ) and the image rotation ( section [ sec : imgrot ] ) and reveal their common form .",
    "the wave equation for a general electric displacment @xmath0 in a rigid dielectric medium rotating with angular velocity @xmath1 is given by : @xmath2   \\left [ \\mathbf{\\omega } \\times \\dot{\\mathbf{d } } - ( \\mathbf{v } \\cdot \\nabla ) \\dot{\\mathbf{d } }   \\right].\\ ] ] an analoguous wave equation can be derived for the magnetic induction @xmath3 .",
    "compared to the form derived by player ( 1976 ) , who considered the special case of a plane wave propagating along the direction of @xmath1 , these wave equations contain an additional term @xmath4 ( \\mathbf{v } \\cdot \\nabla ) \\dot{\\mathbf{d } } $ ] .",
    "this term is responsible for the fresnel drag effect which modifies the speed of light in a moving medium ( mccrea 1954 ; barton 1999 ; rindler 2001 ) . in the following",
    "we will derive this wave equation for the electric displacement .",
    "our analysis starts with the same considerations as player ( 1976 ) , by introducing a rest frame and a moving frame . in the rest frame",
    "the dielectric medium rotates with an angular velocity @xmath5 and in the moving frame the medium is at rest .",
    "we restrict our analysis to small velocities with @xmath6 and use maxwell s equations in both reference frames ( landau & lifshitz 1975 ) . for the medium at rest",
    "we assume the following constitutive relations :    [ eq : constitutive ] @xmath7    where we have used primes to denote the fields and their frequency @xmath8 in the moving frame .",
    "the fields in the moving frame can be expressed in the rest frame by a lorentz transformation ( stratton 1941 ; jackson 1998 ) , which gives to first order in @xmath9 :    [ eq : transforms ] @xmath10    where we have set @xmath11 and work with units in which @xmath12 .",
    "the two constitutive relation in ( [ eq : constitutive ] ) in the rest frame are thus given by    @xmath13    the dielectric constant is still given as a function of the frequency in the moving frame .",
    "we also assume that the dielectric constant depends only on the frequency and is otherwise independent of the state of motion of the medium .",

    "the two remaining terms @xmath46 and @xmath47 together give @xmath48 : @xmath49 this concludes the derivation of the wave equation ( [ eq : finalwaveeq ] ) .",
    "it is possible to derive the same wave equation for @xmath3 using similar methods .    for a rotation around the @xmath50 axis with constant angular velocity @xmath51 ,",
    "the directional derivative @xmath52 is proportional to an azimuthal derivative , as @xmath53 .",

    "player s derivation does not contain the term proportional to @xmath56 because he treated only the case of a plane wave propagating in the @xmath50-direction and for such fields @xmath0 is independent of @xmath57 .",

    "the rotation of the polarisation arises from the difference in the refractive indices for left- and right - circularly polarised light .",
    "the angle per unit length by which the polarisation is rotated is called the specific rotary power . for an optically active medium at rest the specific rotary power is characteristic for a given material , but from ( [ eq : transversewaveeq ] ) it can be seen that light propagates differently in a rotating medium , depending on whether the circular polarisation turns in the same rotation sense as the dielectric or in the opposite sense .",
    "this phenomenon is described by the effective specific rotary power ( jones 1976 ; player 1976 ) .    the specific rotary power , defined as ( fowles 1975 ) : @xmath75 is the angle of rotation of the plane of polarisation in an optical active medium . here , the indices @xmath76 and @xmath77 refer to right- and left - circularly polarised light .",
    "it was convenient to set @xmath11 for our derivation in section [ sec : waveeq ] but we reintroduce it here to facilitate the calculation of measurable quantities . in order to illustrate the effect of the oam of light we choose a bessel beam as an ansatz for the electrical displacement in the @xmath78 plane : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the transverse and longitudinal components of the wavevector .",
