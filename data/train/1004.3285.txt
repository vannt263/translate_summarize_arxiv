    "recently there has been much discussion of how the intervening mass from clustered matter between the last scattering surface ( at @xmath0 ) and an observer at the present time distorts the cmb anisotropy by means of gravitational lensing @xcite . on the level of the two - point correlation function",
    ", this effect distorts the tt ( temperature - temperature ) correlation power spectrum @xcite and mixes the ee and bb polarization power spectra as well as distorting them @xcite .",
    "lensing also introduces non - gaussianities that manifest themselves in the higher - point correlation functions @xcite . at the level of the three - point correlation function , to leading order",
    "there is no nonzero expectation value if we regard the lensing potential as a random field @xcite .",
    "however if we consider the cmb lensing potential as fixed , we find that expectation values of the form _ ( ^ ) do not vanish , and this property may be exploited to recover or `` reconstruct '' the lensing field using estimators quadratic in @xmath1 ( or in @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted to developing an optimal reconstruction of the lensing potential in harmonic space , which implicitly assumes full sky coverage with no galactic cut , no bad pixels due to point sources that must be excised , and no nonuniform weighting to account for uneven sky coverage @xcite . for a reconstruction based on the temperature",
    "anisotropy alone , it has been shown how to construct the optimal quadratic estimator in this idealized context @xcite , and the improvement that can be gained from using an even more optimal maximum likelihood estimator is marginal @xcite , because the distortion due to lensing is small compared to the intrinsic cosmic variance and noise of the experiment ( although this assumption is less valid at very large @xmath4 for very clean maps where the lensing signal is dominant ) . for the exploitation of polarized anisotropies ,",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated .",
    "when the experimental noise is large compared to the b polarization mode generated by lensing , the situation is essentially the same as for a reconstruction using the temperature data @xcite .",
    "however at a higher sensitivity where the b signal is essentially entirely due to lensing , the quadratic estimator underperforms because the actual multipole moments rather than their averages should be used for the optimal weighting . in this case",
    ", the higher order corrections to the quadratic estimator present in the maximum likelihood estimator are no longer negligible @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a real space approach to lensing reconstruction . under the ideal conditions often assumed and described above",
    ", this approach would naturally yield the same result as the conventional approach in harmonic space .",
    "our interest however lies in considering slightly non - optimal estimators that have been modified to have a finite range so that cuts , excisions of pixels , and non - uniform coverage may be included in a simple and flexible way .",
    "we believe that such non - ideal but more robust local estimators defined in real space may prove superior for confronting the complications inherent in analyzing real data @xcite .",
    "another advantage of the approach here is that the dilatation and pure shear provide separate and essentially independent lensing reconstructions which may be confronted with each other .",
    "this feature may prove useful as a way of diagnosing spurious signals , which are unlikely to affect the two reconstructions in the same way .",
    "moreover the presence of two shear components enables one to estimate the noise of the reconstruction through the implied transverse displacement field , which is forbidden in weak lensing .    before proceeding to the details of this program , it is useful to consider the relation between the various descriptions of the lensing and the deformation of the anisotropies in real space",
    ". it is also useful to consider which angular scales contribute the most statistical weight to the lensing reconstruction .",
    "the lensing distortion of the cmb anisotropy on the surface of last scatter may be described in three ways : by a lensing potential @xmath5 by a deflection field @xmath6 or by the three components of the shear tensor =    _ 0+_+ & _ _ & _ 0-_+    = _ a_b . even if we have simultaneous access to the entire sky , the descriptions @xmath7 and @xmath8 suffer from an ambiguity .",
    "@xmath7 can not be distinguished from @xmath9 and the vector field @xmath8 can be measured only up to a constant translation ( or more properly a rotation in the presence of sky curvature ) .",
    "this is because if we know only the cmb power spectrum , a patch of sky and its translation necessarily have the same likelihood on account of isotropy of the underlying stochastic process .",
    "consequently , the absolute translation due to lensing can not be observed . by contrast ,",
    "locally the shear and dilatation ( which are gradients of the translation vector field ) are completely well defined .",
    "this can easily be seen by considering the effect of a constant deformation described by a deformation matrix @xmath10 relating the angular coordinates @xmath11 the actual coordinates on the celestial sphere of a point on the last scattering surface , to the coordinates @xmath12 , the coordinates that the same point would have in the absence of lensing . represents a point on the flattened celestial sphere and @xmath13 represents a wavevector . at times summations over @xmath14 shall also be used .",

    "we may consider a toroidal domain in the limit that the periods of the torus become arbitrarily large ( though the toroidal domain is not essential for the application of the real space estimator presented in this paper ) . before proceeding it is useful to consider the relation of this simplified problem to the real problem of reconstructing the lensing field starting from a cmb map of finite resolution .",

    "however , in the present paper we do not explore how this would work .",
    "we have demonstrated how to reconstruct in real space using a filter of compact support the weak gravitational lensing field , here represented as three fields , a dilatation field @xmath121 and the two components of the pure shear distortion field @xmath122 and @xmath123 the three fields are related by a set of nonlocal consistency conditions , which may subsequently be exploited to reduce the noise of the reconstruction . except for an integration constant and two translational and one rotational zero modes ,",
    "the weak lensing may alternatively and equivalently be described by either ( 1 ) a gravitational lensing potential @xmath124 ( 2 ) a displacement field @xmath125 @xmath124 ( 2 ) a displacement field @xmath126 or ( 3 ) the dilatation field @xmath121 and the two components of the pure shear distortion field @xmath122 and @xmath123 in this paper we argue that for the purpose of reconstruction the representation ( 3 ) is advantageous because this is the representation for which the lensing field bears a local relation to the real space cmb maps .",
    "this locality comes at a price because the three components are not independent and subject to nonlocal consistency conditions , which may be exploited to improve the reconstruction .",
    "locality allows different regions of the sky to be analyzed independently in a natural way , quite unlike the quadratic reconstruction in harmonic space , where the entire sky must be analyzed simultaneously .",
    "this approach and variations thereof hold promise for dealing with partial sky coverage and excised point sources . for the filters developed in this paper",
    "there is very little loss of information for the lensing field at low wavenumbers .",
    "however at larger wavenumbers the lensing signal is attenuated according to a wavenumber dependent form factor , which can be deconvolved by applying a correction filter .",

    "<S> we explore the reconstruction of the gravitational lensing field of the cosmic microwave background in real space showing that very little statistical information is lost when estimators of short range on the celestial sphere are used in place of the customary estimators in harmonic space , which are nonlocal and in principle require a simultaneous analysis of the entire sky without any cuts or excisions . because virtually all the information relevant to lensing reconstruction lies on angular scales close to the resolution scale of the sky map , the gravitational lensing dilatation and shear fields ( which unlike the deflection field or lensing potential are directly related to the observations in a local manner ) </S>",
    "<S> may be reconstructed by means of quadratic combinations involving only very closely separated pixels . </S>",
    "<S> even though harmonic space provides a more natural context for understanding lensing reconstruction theoretically , the real space methods developed here have the virtue of being faster to implement and are likely to prove useful for analyzing realistic maps containing a galactic cut and possibly numerous small excisions to exclude point sources that can not be reliably subtracted . </S>"
