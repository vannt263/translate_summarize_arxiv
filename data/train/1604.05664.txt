    "state - of - the - art experimental techniques allow the experimentalist today to directly study a plethora of minimal models that have been developed in a solid - state physics context @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates loaded into optical lattices , which realize spatially periodic structures , are used , e.g. , to implement many - body models such as the celebrated bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) in one , two or even three dimensions .",
    "other possible realizations of lattice systems with controllable couplings and interactions are based on arrays of optical cavities @xcite or superconducting circuits @xcite , for instance .    already in 2003 and 2004 ,",
    "the spectral statistics of one - dimensional bhm were studied @xcite .",
    "later extended models were also investigated , see e.g. @xcite , which essentially confirmed these results .",
    "recently , a semiclassical theory has been developed to understand the chaotic behavior of one - dimensional bhms and to put the results mentioned above onto a firmer ground @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the spectral characteristics in a many - body system can be exploited to understand , engineer and control the system s dynamics , making such models and their experimental realizations interesting for the study of quantum thermalization and non - equilibrium transport phenomena , see e.g. @xcite .    in this paper , we want to extend the spectral analysis to the case of two - dimensional bhms with strong interparticle interactions .",
    "the dynamics of two - dimensional tight - binding systems was studied before in the noninteracting case @xcite , or in the specific case of a four mode interacting system @xcite . analyzing different minimal models of up to a 3x3 square lattice",
    ", we will see how the geometry of the lattice and the number of permitted couplings ( i.e. the number of bonds ) determines the spectral properties of the systems .",
    "we restrict to such small numbers of lattice sites but treat particles numbers @xmath0 , such that the size of the total hilbert space is sufficiently large for obtaining good statistics .",
    "this still allows for a full diagonalization of the many - body quantum problem and the scanning of a broad parameter space .",
    "the next section presents our class of models and the studied lattices .",
    "it introduces all the spectral measures we computed as well .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] reports our main results , showing the transition from regular to chaotic spectral statistics in dependence on the lattices structures and the system parameters .",
    "section [ sec : con ] concludes the paper discussing also experimental ramifications of our work .",
    "the most general form of the types of hamiltonians we are studying is @xmath1     sketch of the lattice geometries used here .",
    "we study three basic settings of a 2x2 ( a ) , a 2x3 ( b ) and a 3x3 lattice ( c ) .",
    "the minimal bonds are always present ( solid lines ) , while the additional diagonal bonds ( green dotted and red dashed lines ) are gradually added . in ( b ) and",
    "( c ) we allow also for periodic boundary conditions ( represented by the blue dot - dashed lines ) . ]        here the vector @xmath2 describes one point in the two - dimensional plane of a quadratic lattice , with the indices running from @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the matrix of on - site energies @xmath5 is assumed to be identical to zero .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively , and @xmath8 is the number operator .",
    "the specific geometries we investigate in the following are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . for all connected bonds the tunneling coupling @xmath9 ,",
    "otherwise it is zero .",
    "the particle number @xmath10 is chosen accordingly to the number of lattice sites @xmath11 such that the total dimension @xmath12 of the many - particle fock space is @xmath13 typical dimensions of the systems studied here are @xmath14 , which provide us with sufficient statistics over the eigenvalues at numerically easily affordable computation times .",
    "when doing spectral statistics with hubbard models , we must consider the symmetries of the systems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "typical symmetries are translation invariance in the presence of period boundary conditions , mirror symmetries and parity . which symmetries are simultaneously present depends on the form of the lattice and the number of bonds .",
    "in the case of the 2x3 lattice sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , for instance , we have the symmetries discussed in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . the four symmetry reduced subspaces shown in fig . [ fig:2](a )",
    "have dimensions ranging between @xmath15 , and in ( b ) we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the two subspaces respectively . in fig . [ fig:2](c )",
    "the dimensions of the subspaces vary between @xmath18",
    ". the larger variation of the dimensions in the latter case is due to the fact that some subspaces decompose further than others .",
    "the reason for this is the presence of an additional symmetry not commuting with all the other ones .",
    "note that in the cases where diagonal bonds are present , the periodic boundary conditions also involve diagonal bonds such that translational invariance is respected .    with the right choice of the basis , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "can be written in block - diagonal form corresponding to the irreducible representation that takes care of all symmetries which simultaneously commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "then we can focus our analysis on just one of these blocks so that level crossing due to states from different symmetry sectors are excluded . for large problems , this reduces the numerical complexity by about the number of independent blocks . for achieving optimal statistics we can analyse the individual blocks separately and then we collect in one plot",
    "all data thus obtained .    before analyzing the eigenvalues of a symmetry reduced block",
    ", we must unfold the spectrum such that global trends in the spectrum are taken out .",
    "the effect of the unfolding procedure is that we can directly study the local spectral fluctuations which are crucial in any comparison with random matrix theory , see e.g. @xcite for details .",
    "the unfolding procedure we use is described as follows .",
    "after normalizing the spectral range to the interval @xmath19 $ ] , we take the differences between consecutive energies @xmath20 and divide them by a local average : @xmath21 where @xmath22 averages over the window @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the window size is typically @xmath24 .",
    "we use in practice a smoothed energy level density , obtained by replacing the delta - functions in its definition by gaussian peaks of a width @xmath25 .",
    "then the parameter @xmath25 can be optimized such that we obtain good statistics without loss of relevant spectral information .",
    "after reducing the system into block - diagonal form , finding the eigenvalues by diagonalizing and unfolding the such obtained spectra , we analyze them using several methods which we are describing now .",
    "it is well known that symmetry - reduced ( sub)systems can show regular , mixed and chaotic signatures which manifest in their spectral distributions @xcite .",
    "typically , one compares them to the predictions coming from the theory of random matrices ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "this is also what we do here .",
    "the standard measure for short - range spectral correlations is the distribution of the distances @xmath26 of nearest neighbor levels . for regular ( pseudo-)random spectra ,",
    "one expects a poisson distribution @xmath27 fully chaotic spectra do not allow for level crossings which are suppressed by level couplings .",
    "the corresponding distribution for our type of systems is the wigner - dyson one for time - invariant systems without spin ( goe ) : @xmath28 for mixed systems , an interpolating distribution is usually seen .",
    "one of the standard candidates is the so called brody distribution with the brody parameter @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 . the unfolding procedure mentioned in subsection [ sec :",
    "level ] guarantees a mean level spacing @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the numerical data is readily fitted with the normalized distributions above .",
    "we tested also the measure @xmath33 introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the ratio of consecutive nearest neighbor spacings @xmath34 and @xmath35 , defined by @xmath36 this measure has the advantage that no unfolding is needed ( because of the ratios of consecutive distances ) and , therefore , statistical fluctuations are better controlled .",
    "the limiting case for poisson spectra @xcite is @xmath37 and for goe wigner - dyson spectra @xcite @xmath38    to test also the long - range correlations in the spectra we analyze in parallel to the short - range measures mentioned above the number variance of levels defined by @xmath39     ( left panels : ( a ) , ( c ) , ( e ) ) and @xmath40 ( right panels :",
    "( b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) ) .",

    "it is controlled by the system parameter @xmath50 . in panel",
    "( b ) , for the regular case , we do not have a fully regular spectrum for this parameter @xmath50 .",

    "@xmath57 is the euler constant .    finally , in order to scan over a wide range of parameters , it turned out that it is useful to quantify the spectral correlations by a single number ( i.e. averaged over an entire spectrum ) .",

    "moreover , we define the new measure based on the number variance : @xmath60 this correlation length characterizes up to which @xmath61 the numerical @xmath62 follows the predictions for quantum chaos .",
    "since the poissonian case corresponds to a totally uncorrelated spectrum , we can indeed interpret it as a measure of the correlation length in the spectrum .",
    "the typical choice @xmath63 is justified by the fact that due to the unfolding procedure the energy scale of distances is normalized to unity .",
    "statistical tests for the regular - to - chaotic transition for a 2x3 lattice at @xmath44 .",
