    "understanding the effect of confinement on crystalline materials is crucial to many technological applications , such as lubrication , adhesion , and fabricating novel optical , catalytic materials  @xcite .",
    "for example , during film processes , which are important for optoelectronics , magnetic and electronic materials  @xcite , internal stresses often arise affecting the mechanical stability and strength of the film  @xcite . here",
    "we study increasingly confined colloidal crystals to investigate how changes in their microstructure affect the microscopic stresses ultimately responsible for their bulk mechanical properties .",
    "such colloidal systems are comprised of particles small enough to undergo brownian motions that preserve a thermodynamic ensemble , while still large enough to be optically imaged with high temporal and spatial resolutions  @xcite .",
    "as such , colloidal crystals have been widely used as a model system to elucidate many phenomena associated with confinement including crystal growth  @xcite , packing  @xcite , and melting mechanisms@xcite .    in principle , knowing all particle positions and their interactions is sufficient to determine the suspension s structural order and stress distribution .",
    "unfortunately , resolving the stress distribution within colloidal materials has remained experimentally challenging . in the simplest colloidal system  hard - spheres ",

    "the steep hard - sphere potential and experimental noise in locating particles make potential - based stress calculation ( force times relative vector ) impractical in experiment . in this work",
    ", we use a new technique  stress assessment from local structural anisotropy ( salsa )  to measure the stress distribution in confined hard - sphere colloidal polycrystals  @xcite .",
    "salsa uses the particle positions captured using confocal microscopy to calculate the orientation dependent particle collision probabilities .",
    "these probabilities are used to determine the stress at the single particle scale . using salsa",
    "we follow the evolving stress distribution in a polycrystal as it is compressed quasi - statically between two parallel plates .",
    "we conduct experiments with suspensions comprised of sterically stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate ) , pmma , particles .",
    "the particles have a diameter of @xmath0 @xmath1 m , polydispersity @xmath2 , and are fluorescently labeled with diic@xmath3(3 ) ( 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ) for confocal imaging .",
    "the solvent  a mixture of decalin and cxb ( cyclohexylbromide )  has a refractive index and density that nearly match those of the pmma particles .",
    "while a slight mismatch between the particle and solvent density @xmath4 0.03 g/@xmath5 is introduced to induce slow sedimentation for the bulk samples , the confined crystal samples are all density - matched .",
    "we approximate the hard - sphere interparticle force by saturating the solvent with tetrabutyl ammonium bromide ( tbab ) at a concentration  ( @xmath6 260 nm )  @xcite , and using a syringe filter to remove any excess salt granules  @xcite .",
    "the added tbab salt screens the electrostatic force and results in a debye length , @xmath6 100 nm , substantially smaller than the particle diameter@xcite .",
    "we use a high - speed confocal laser scanning microscope ( zeiss , lsm 5 live ) to image the 3d structure of the sample .",
    "we acquire a time series of 15 image stacks where each stack contains up to 512@xmath7512@xmath7500 voxels , corresponding to a sample volume of 71@xmath771@xmath768 @xmath1m@xmath8 .",

    "while the trace of the time - averaged fabric tensor @xmath41 determines the contact particle number , the off - diagonal terms report the anisotropy of these contact particle configurations .",
    "when averaged over time , the fabric tensor of the selected particle captures the probability of brownian collisions between it and its neighbors .",
    "this probability is linearly proportional to the cutoff distance , or shell thickness @xmath34 when @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , when scaling the collision probability by @xmath34 , the stress is independent of @xmath34 .",
    "the last step of the salsa calculation scales the probability by the energy density per collision @xmath43 . in a defect - free crystal , @xmath44 is simply the system volume divided by the particle number .",
    "however , in a crystal containing defects , the local volume occupied by each particle varies .",
    "this variation needs to be considered to correctly measure the stress near defects .",

    "@xmath46 in theory , should be an infinitesimal volume . in practice , when the pointwise stresses are assigned to a 3d discrete grid , @xmath46 is the single box volume of the grid .",
    "the continuum stress field @xmath47 is then smoothed , @xmath48 , where in our experiments @xmath49  the weighting kernel  is a gaussian function @xmath50  @xcite . in particular , we set @xmath51 to remove stress features on length scales smaller than a particle .",
    "we have tested different discrete grid sizes , and other normalized weighting kernels , and find the results insensitive to those changes .",
    "this spatial average effectively addresses local volume variation .  finally , while salsa can be modified to account for the contributions due to the confining surfaces , for simplicity , in the data presented here , we exclude boundary particles in all final presentations of local structure and stress distributions .",

    "[ htp ]    to determine whether the crystalline order affects the stress distribution we apply salsa to our polycrystal . since the magnitudes of individual stress components depend on the orientation of the coordinate system , we focus on primary tensor invariants , including the pressure , the three principal stresses , and the von mises stress .",
    "our polycrystal sample has a mean pressure @xmath55 approximately 39 mpa , consistent with the prediction from previous numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the measured pressure as a function of height is also consistent with the estimated trend of hydrostatic pressure arising from gravitational settling due to the slight mismatch in the particle and solvent densities ( @xmath4 0.03 g/@xmath5 ) .",

    "the pressure fluctuation has a length scale @xmath56 10 particles considerably smaller than the size of a single domain indicating _ intragrain _ stress fluctuations . by comparing the pressure ( fig .",

    "since this invariant satisfies the property that two stress configurations with equal deviatoric strain energy have the same value of @xmath61 , such a scalar is effectively a stress field signature capturing the distortion energy of a material under various loads  : the corresponding von mises stress is @xmath62 .",

    "counterintuitively , the distribution of the high @xmath61 particles does not follow the trend of the grain boundaries shown in fig .",

    "the rheoscope has three differential screws that allow us to finely adjust the alignment and gap @xmath67 between two parallel plates holding the sample .",
    "we study the confined sample for seven different gap heights , starting with a bulk sample ( @xmath68 @xmath1 m @xmath69 ) .",
    "we then gradually move the bottom plate upward , reducing the gap height down to @xmath70 @xmath1 m @xmath71 .",

    "similar to the bulk measurements , the pressure fluctuations in confined samples are evenly spread , and roughly uncorrelated with the grain boundary arrangement .",
    "furthermore , as anticipated , the mean pressure remains approximately constant ( to within @xmath72 of the mean ) as @xmath67 decreases .",

    "in particular , we do not see evidence of significant deviations from gaussian behavior as is typically observed in glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "although the mean and standard deviations of the pressure are unaffected by confinement , its spatial distribution substantially changes . in the bulk sample",

    "more importantly , the mean deviatoric stress approximately doubles while @xmath94 decreases only by @xmath95 . in atomic systems",
    "higher @xmath93 indicates the system is closer to yielding suggesting a lower shear stress would be required to induce plastic deformation of the crystal .",
    "our studies , which combine both structure and stress measurement at the single particle scale , clearly illustrate that confinement can have profound consequences for stress distributions in hard sphere crystals .",
    "while we find that the distribution of the pressure and the von mises stress are weakly correlated with the grain boundary location , their fluctuations become more localized due to the additional grain boundaries introduced by our confining procedure .",
    "thus , the grain boundaries effectively shield each grain from the specific spatial distribution of stresses in neighboring grains .",
    "in addition , we find that the deviatoric stress has a much wider distribution of magnitudes and a mean value that nearly doubles as the gap is reduced from @xmath96 to @xmath97 . in our system , this reduction in gap produces smaller grain sizes .",
    "such a grain size reduction has been suggested to have a great influence on the microstructure@xcite , defect density@xcite , and particle diffusivity  @xcite in polycrystals .",
    "more importantly , in atomic nanocrystals , grain size reduction leads to substantially lower yield stress a phenomena known as the inverse hall - petch relation  @xcite .",
    "such trends are consistent with our observed enhancement in the deviatoric stress ",
    "typically a measure of how close a system is to yielding .",
    "further experiments in which the normal force is continuously measured or experiments in which the yield stress under shear is determined for crystals under different degrees of confinement would shed light on whether a direct link can be made between our colloidal system and films comprised of nanocrystalline grains .    such studies would also help determine whether different yielding mechanisms dominate when the grain size is reduced .",
    "for example , it has been shown in numerical simulations that in large grains dislocations penetrate the grains and entangle resulting in strain hardening . in contrast , for small grains , plastic flow induces stacking faults and twining that localize near grain boundaries , and do not contribute significantly to the flow stress .",
    "experiments in which we can simultaneously plastically deform the crystals while measuring their order and stress evolutions would elucidate whether similar mechanisms are at play in these hard sphere colloidal crystals .    more broadly , combining the bulk stress measurement and salsa provides a direct way to quantify the interplay between microscopic defect structures and macroscopic mechanical properties .",
    "this approach opens the door to uncovering the mechanisms that underly many defect - dominated phenomena in solid mechanics including defect - assisted premelting , strain hardening , and material fatigue .",
    "to grow a bulk crystal , we set the solvent density value ( @xmath98 g/@xmath5 ) slightly lower than the particle density ( @xmath99 g/@xmath5 ) , so the particles can sediment and form a crystal with a higher volume fraction .",

    "we calculate the three principal stresses @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 and show them in fig .",
    "[ afig_3_principal_stress ] .",
    "the three principal stresses are the eigenvalues of the stress tensor , and are thus independent of the coordinate orientation .",
    "the common trend between the three principal stresses corresponds to the hydrostatic pressure variation , while the difference is related to the deviatoric stress @xmath61 .",
    "we calculate @xmath61 and visualize its distribution within the sample by excluding particles with @xmath61 < 22 mpa . the thresholded field is shown in fig .  [ afig_4_threshold_vonmises ] .",
    "we find no obvious correlation between the distribution of the particles with large @xmath61 and the grain boundaries within the polycrystal .",
