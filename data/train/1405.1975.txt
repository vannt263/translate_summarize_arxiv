    "so far , all available lhc higgs data has been found to be consistent with the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . in addition , the lhc has not detected any signals of beyond the standard model physics @xcite , so it is reasonable to assume that the standard model correctly describes nature at the weak scale . with the discovery @xcite of the higgs boson @xcite with a mass of @xmath1 gev @xcite all the parameters of the standard model",
    "are now known and one can extrapolate the sm to higher energies to verify it s consistency . +",
    "recently the the behaviour of the higgs quartic coupling , @xmath2 , has been of particular interest , since it determines whether the standard model electroweak ( higgs ) vacuum is stable , metastable or unstable @xcite . the previously most accurate calculations @xcite show that the higgs quartic coupling , @xmath2 , may become negative at energies @xmath3 gev , if so , this means that the higgs potential has a global minimum at large higgs field values , @xmath4",
    ". this minimum corresponds to the true vacuum state of the theory , with large negative energy density @xmath5 gev@xmath6 .",
    "however , the previous calculations found the experimentally determined value of the higgs mass to be @xmath7-@xmath8 away from that required for absolute stability of the ew vacuum @xcite , which was not accurate enough to establish the fate of the vacuum conclusively .",
    "+ in @xcite , the standard model parameters were extrapolated to high energies by solving three - loop renormalisation group equations ( rges ) in the modified minimal subtraction scheme ( @xmath9 ) , which is an example of a mass - independent renormalisation scheme in which the @xmath10-functions take an explicitly mass and renormalisation scale , @xmath11 , independent form ( of course , the couplings are still implicitly a function of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the mass and scale independence of the @xmath12 rges makes them simpler and easier to solve than their mass - dependent counterparts .",
    "however , as a result of this mass independence , @xmath12 @xmath10-functions violate the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem @xcite and one must define a sequence of effective field theories , with massive particles integrated out at their mass thresholds , and with the effective couplings of each theory suitably matched together @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath9 higgs quartic self - interaction coupling @xmath13 , the higgs - top yukawa coupling @xmath14 and the electroweak gauge couplings were computed by matching them with physical observables : the pole masses of the higgs boson ( @xmath15 ) , the top quark ( @xmath0 ) , the @xmath16-boson ( @xmath17 ) , the @xmath18-boson ( @xmath19 ) , the @xmath9 strong gauge coupling at @xmath16-pole ( @xmath20 ) , and the fermi constant @xmath21 .",
    "this matching takes place at the top quark pole - mass with 2-loop threshold corrections included .",
    "small uncertainties arise as a result of this procedure , but since the bounds on @xmath22 and @xmath0 for absolute stability of the higgs vacuum are so sensitive to errors in the boundary conditions it is important to reduce the uncertainties as much as possible .",
    "+     plane .",
    "the colouring shows regions of ew vacuum instability ( red ) , metastability ( yellow ) and stability ( green ) .",
    "the ellipses are centred at the experimentally determined central values of @xmath0 and @xmath22 and show the @xmath23-@xmath8 error bands .",
    "the shaded regions between the dashed lines indicate the @xmath24-@xmath8 bands in the determination of the maximum @xmath0 allowed for metastability ( upper set of lines ) and absolute stability ( lower set of lines).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    here we perform the evolution of all couplings for the running of @xmath2 to one - loop in a mass - dependent scheme , which avoids the need for large matching corrections and treats threshold effects analytically . at two and three loops we use the @xmath12 rges from @xcite and second loop matching and threshold corrections from @xcite .",
    "this results in a sizeable reduction in the theoretical error associated with with the use of threshold corrections , and a reduction in the error from ignoring higher - order perturbative corrections .",
    "we now find that the largest source of uncertainty in the determination of the fate of the ew vacuum comes from the experimental error in the measurement of @xmath0 . in order to ensure absolute stability of the electroweak vacuum we find the following bound on the top pole mass @xcite @xmath25",
    "the upper value from the above bound , @xmath26 gev , is @xmath27-@xmath8 away from the central experimental value of @xmath28 gev @xcite . using the @xmath12 mass obtained from total top pair production cross section",
    "is presented in @xcite .",
    "the authors of the analysis used in this work discuss uncertainties of up to @xmath24 gev coming from possible differences between the measured ( monte - carlo ) and pole masses .",
    "however , even taking into account these , the total error is significantly less than the error in the analysis of @xcite.we leave it to the reader to decide which is the more appropriate result . ] in other words , we find that absolute stability of the higgs vacuum within the standard model is excluded at 99.98% c.l .",
    "( one sided ) .",
    "the results of our improved stability analysis are shown in figure [ fig : higgs phase diagram ] .",
    "+ the outline for the remainder of this work is as follows : in section [ schemes ] we compare mass - dependent and mass - independent renormalisation schemes , then , in section [ boundary conds ] , we explain the particular mass - dependent scheme we will use and the weak - scale boundary conditions for the rges in this scheme . following that we perform the extrapolation of @xmath2 and related couplings up to the planck scale and derive bounds on the physical inputs based on the requirement of absolute stability of the electroweak vacuum in section [ sec : running ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : implications ] we will discuss the physical implications of our findings , particularly those for inflationary cosmology and the consequences for new physics .",
    "given an arbitrary field theory the first task at hand is to compute the green s functions .",
    "going beyond tree - level , one encounters divergent loop diagrams which are rendered finite through a choice of subtraction scheme .",
    "+ in the case of an unphysical renormalisation scheme , one is purely interested in finiteness of the greens functions , which is achieved by removing any divergent terms , and possibly some renormalisation scale , @xmath11 , independent constants .",
    "since the counterterms only contains poles and constants , the resulting @xmath10-functions take a simple mass and @xmath11 independent form , as is the case for the most commonly used mass - independent schemes , @xmath12 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , we now find that massive particles do not decouple from the running of couplings .",
    "this is an artifact of the unphysical renormalisation scheme used ",
    "the counterterms and rges are blind to massive particle thresholds and in general these schemes violate the applequist - carazzone decoupling theorem @xcite . in order to satisfy the theorem and get a massive particle to decouple below it s mass threshold , @xmath30 ,",
    "one must set @xmath31 below @xmath30 and @xmath32 above by hand . for more complicated theories with multiple mass thresholds one",
    "is forced to use a series of effective field theories with the massive particles integrated out at their respective threshold .",
    "the contribution of a massive particle to the rges is then artificially switched on at threshold with a step function . since a step function is used , this method fails to take into account the finite probability for a particle to contribute to some physical process by appearing in loop diagrams at momenta below mass threshold .",
    "+ in practice one is able to approximately correct for these threshold effects by matching @xmath12 ( or whichever unphysical scheme is being used ) couplings with physical observables ( e.g. pole masses ) . in our example",
    "we would force the low energy limit of the charge to coincide with the macroscopic electron charge .",
    "technically this is achieved by comparing expressions for green s functions with couplings renormalised in the on - mass - shell ( oms ) scheme to those renormalised in the unphysical scheme as outlined in @xcite .",
    "one is then able to invert the resultant expression and solve for the @xmath12 couplings in terms of oms quantities and logarithms of @xmath11 .",
    "errors arise in two places  firstly , if the green s functions are renormalised to @xmath33th loop order then the matching relations will suffer errors of ( @xmath34)th loop order and greater since these terms are ignored when one inverts @xmath12 couplings in terms of oms ones .",
    "additional errors creep in when one uses the matching formulae away from the pole masses appearing in the un - resummed logarithmic terms . taking the standard model as an example and matching couplings at the top - pole we would find that reasonably large errors arise from neglecting higher order corrections in the top yukawa , strong gauge and higgs quartic couplings .",
    "+ on the other hand , for a physical renormalisation scheme , such as momentum space subtraction ( mom ) @xcite or , equivalently , an effective charge scheme , the green s functions are directly related to a set of physical observables ( e.g. pole masses and/or cross sections ) at a given reference momentum through choice of the the counterterms .",
    "then the counterterms necessarily contain finite expressions in particle masses and the renormalisation scale @xmath11 , as well as divergent parts .",
    "the @xmath10-functions which follow from these will then , in general , depend explicitly on particle masses and @xmath11 ( mass - dependent rges ) . using mom ,",
    "our renormalisation conditions stipulate , for example , that the counterterms should absorb the radiative corrections to a given green s function when the momentum @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is equivalent to spacelike scale @xmath37 , and the resulting @xmath10-functions resulting from the renormalisation of , e.g. the two point functions , look like @xmath38 now we find that that appelquist - carazzone is automatically satisfied with @xmath39 as @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath42 smoothly .",
    "by contrast with @xmath12 , no matching between mom and oms couplings is necessary since the mom renormalisation conditions reduce to the oms ones when @xmath43 coincides with the corresponding pole mass squared .",
    "additionally , if one uses a physical renormalisation scheme to @xmath33-loop order the resulting rges automatically encode the analytic @xmath33-loop threshold behaviour of the couplings in question , and also the @xmath33th log threshold behaviour since the logs describing the threshold behaviour are now included in the counterterms and are resummed via the renormalisation group .",
    "alternatively , an analytic extension of the @xmath12 scheme was proposed in @xcite + it must be stressed that , in principle , predictions for observables are renormalisation scheme independent . however , working to finite order in perturbation theory different schemes will give different predictions . in the case of qcd differences",
    "were found in the two loop running of the mass - dependent mom @xmath44 and it s @xmath12 counterpart , which could only be resolved by a rescaling of the couplings @xcite .",
    "coupling should be rescaled to match the mom coupling .",
    "however , since the @xmath12 scale was already fixed for the experimental fit , the authors were forced to rescale the mom coupling , in order to make a comparison between the two .",
    "] this reflects the inclusion of higher order threshold effects in the rge running of the mom coupling as compared to the fixed order matching for the @xmath12 coupling .",
    "+ in mass - dependent renormalisation schemes we find that the two point green s functions evaluate to elements of a class of log like functions @xcite , of which is just one example .",
    "these arise from the appearance of passarino - veltman ( pv ) integrals @xcite in the evaluation of loop diagrams .",
    "the two - point functions involve the two - point pv scalar integral , @xmath45 , which , for @xmath43 at a multi - particle threshold , has a pole , and develops an imaginary part for @xmath43 above this threshold .",
    "if we wish to use observables to determine boundary conditions on the couplings we must analytically continue our @xmath10-functions to complex @xmath46 ( or equivalently , real @xmath11 ) , a prescription for the analytic continuation can be found in @xcite . to avoid the poles at multi particle thresholds one must integrate the rges from timelike to spacelike scales , then up the real @xmath46 line far enough so that all poles are passed when one integrates back to real @xmath11 . in the limit @xmath47 all imaginary parts of the @xmath10-functions disappear , but at finite scales they contribute to the rges . +",
    "if accuracy is not the principle concern then unphysical renormalisation schemes provide the rges for the theory in question in their simplest mass - independent form .",
    "however , by removing some of the chief problems that plague these unphysical schemes , physical renormalisation offers a significant improvement in precision when extrapolating the couplings of a qft to high energies .",
    "this was previously exploited to perform a high - precision analysis of gauge coupling unification in supersymmetric gut models @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on a different question , namely the fate of the standard model electroweak vacuum , which rests upon a similarly high - precision determination of the behaviour of the higgs quartic at high energies , under the assumption of no new physics beyond the standard model before the planck scale .",
    "tree - level inputs for our calculation are obtained from observables and are summarised in table [ ew inputs ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table 3 ]",
    "following @xcite , our condition on @xmath22 for absolute stability of the electroweak vacuum is the minimum value of @xmath22 for which @xmath48 for some scale @xmath49 , with all other inputs at the weak - scale set to their central values . to obtain the condition on @xmath0 for absolute stability we use the same definition , but we now find the maximum @xmath0 that satisfies with @xmath22 and the other inputs fixed to their central values .",
    "we perform the above analysis using @xmath13 from the rg - improved tree level potential @xmath50 in principle a more accurate determination of these conditions can be obtained using @xmath51 from the rg - improved two loop effective potential , however , the effective potential , renormalised in bfmom , is unavailable . in the @xmath12 case ,",
    "@xcite compared the critical value for @xmath22 obtained from the effective potential to that from the rg - improved tree - level potential and found that the difference was @xmath52 gev .",
    "we include this in our estimate of error in the stability conditions .",
    "+ to construct the stability phase diagram ( figure [ fig : higgs phase diagram ] ) we must decide if the electroweak vacuum is stable , metastable or unstable given the inputs values for @xmath22 and @xmath0 .",
    "in practice the definition reduces to checking if @xmath53 over the range of the running , if so , the region in @xmath0@xmath22 phase space is classified as stable . on the other hand , if we find that @xmath54 for some @xmath11 over the running , we must then determine if this point corresponds to a metastable or unstable region in phase space .",
    "following @xcite we classify a point in phase space as metastable if the current vacuum decay probability , @xmath55 .",
    "points in phase space with @xmath54 and @xmath56 are classified as unstable .",
    "the semi - classical result for @xmath57 is @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the current hubble rate and @xmath60 is the action for a bounce with size @xmath61 . since the potential in is classically scale invariant we find that bounces of any @xmath62 have equal action , so any @xmath62 will do .",
    "radiative corrections break the scale invariance when one calculates the one - loop action for the bounce , as in @xcite .",
    "formally , to use the one loop corrected @xmath57 , one must replace @xmath2 with the running coupling , add a correction @xmath63 to the action and then minimise over the scale @xmath64 , however , approximately the same @xmath57 may be obtained by simply minimising @xmath2 over the running @xcite .",

    "the complete set of rges in our renormalisation scheme may be found in appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "qualitatively the running is very similar to that in the @xmath12 case - at high energies @xmath66 and @xmath67 . with regard to issues concerning criticality and boundary conditions at the planck scale , we will not add anything further than has already been discussed in @xcite .",

    "following the prescription outlined in @xcite we obtain a @xmath72 gev uncertainty coming from higher perturbative order corrections , and @xmath52 gev error coming from our use of the rg - improved tree - level , rather than effective , potential . in their error analysis @xcite also included an uncertainty arising from the use of the matching formulae as opposed to using the exact running .",
    "we believe that our mass - dependent scheme effectively removes this uncertainty , but since these errors were not accounted for in @xcite our estimates for the uncertainties end up being roughly the same as theirs . combining all the errors in quadrature we obtain @xmath73",
    "we find a larger variation in the critical value of @xmath22 than in @xcite as a result of the increased error in the latest measurement of @xmath0 ( compare @xcite with ref . [ 86 ] in @xcite ) . since the error in our determination of the stability condition is greater than the error in the measurement of the higgs mass we use the former to determine the significance of our result .",

    "( one sided ) .",
    "very recently there has been a renewal of interest in the cosmological aspects of the vacuum stability problem , with the bicep collaboration s announcement of their discovery of b - mode polarisation in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "these polarisation modes are widely attributed to primordial gravitational waves .",
    "bicep measures a tensor - to - scalar amplitude ratio of @xcite @xmath80 with which one can infer the rate of inflation : @xmath81 given such a large rate of inflation , and assuming a simple model in which the inflaton does not couple to the higgs ( the case of higgs - inflaton interations will be discussed later ) , the transition from a metastable electroweak higgs vacuum to the true vacuum ( with large negative energy density ) is dominated by the hawking - moss ( hm ) instanton @xcite .",
    "an analytical expression for the decay rate of the electroweak vacuum via the hm instanton was calculated and implications for inflationary models discussed in @xcite .",
    "the probability that the electroweak vacuum , @xmath82 , decays during ` visible ' inflation , @xmath83 , via the hm instanton is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is @xmath87 evaluated at the instability scale @xmath68 ( the expression was also derived using stochastic arguments in @xcite ) .",
    "given the large inflationary scale and the sm instability scale , the numerical value of the decay probability via the hm instanton was calculated in @xcite and found to be @xmath88 . even though there is up to a two order - of - magnitude gauge dependence in the instability scale used to calculate @xmath57 @xcite , since the rate of inflation is so large it turns out that the result for @xmath89 is robust .",
    "consequently , the measured value of @xmath0 must be very close to the stability bound , otherwise vacuum decay prevents simple inflation from proceeding .",
    "in fact , repeating our analysis from section [ sec : running ] , with the flat spacetime decay probability replaced with the decay probability during inflation , we find that , in order to ensure inflation proceeds , the top quark mass must satisfy the condition @xmath90 which is @xmath91-@xmath8 away from the experimental value ( table [ ew inputs ] ) . given that the required value of the top - pole is so far from the experimentally measured value , we can conclude that the electroweak vacuum could not have survived simple inflation if one assumes no new physics beyond the sm up to the planck scale . + it has been argued that , within the multiverse picture of eternal inflation @xcite , only patches of universe with electroweak vacuum initial conditions survive due to the collapse of ads bubbles formed if vacuum decay occurs @xcite , which amounts to a process of cosmological selection. however , as was found in @xcite , higgs vacuum decay via the hm instanton occurs quickly enough for inflation to cease globally and not only within one hubble volume , and , again , we arrive at the conclusion from our previous paragraph .",
    "+ now we discuss the implications of our new results for non - minimal models of inflation . it has been suggested that non - minimal inflationary models such as those with inflaton - higgs interactions , or non - minimal higgs - gravity interactions ( that induce a large effective mass for the higgs boson during inflation ) , may suppress higgs vacuum decay , even with a large inflationary rate @xcite .",
    "however , these interactions only suppress the mechanism whereby the higgs vacuum decays due to superhorizon quantum fluctuations during inflation @xcite .",
