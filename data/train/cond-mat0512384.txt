    "the mesoscopic aharonov - bohm interferometer ( abi ) has been used widely in attempts to measure both the magnitude and the phase of the quantum transmission amplitude for an electron traversing a quantum dot ( qd ) .",
    "many of these experiments have been done on the _ closed _ abi , where the qd is placed on one of the two paths which surround an area which is penetrated by a magnetic flux @xmath0 , and the two paths are connected to two reservoirs via only two terminals .",
    "@xcite in some experiments , the states on the whole path replace the qd .",
    "@xcite unlike for the multi - terminal _",
    "abi , for small fluxes the conductance of the closed interferometer turned out to be an _ even and periodic function of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) phase _",
    "@xmath1 , with @xmath2 and with the period @xmath3 .",
    "away from resonances of the transmission , and for relatively small magnetic fields , the conductance of the ` ideal ' closed abi could be fitted to the simple ( two - slit - like ) formula @xmath4 , and therefore its maxima ( and minima ) remained fixed at integer multiples of @xmath5 , independent of the gate voltage on the qd ( which only affected the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "this phenomenon , called  phase rigidity \" , has been accepted as a landmark of the closed abi .",
    "@xcite closer to a resonance , @xmath8 becomes a more complicated function of @xmath9 , which contains higher harmonics in the flux , but continues to depend only on powers of @xmath10 ( and not of @xmath11 ) .",
    "indeed , the symmetry @xmath12 is now well understood , due to the onsager relations .",
    "@xcite the periodicity of @xmath8 with @xmath9 , and the resulting phase rigidity , have also been reproduced theoretically , in models which describe both the paths around the abi ring and the leads to the reservoirs as being one - dimensional ( 1d ) .",
    "@xcite however , although phase rigidity obeys the onsager symmetry , this rigidity does not really _ follow _ from this symmetry .",
    "in fact , many of the measurements at higher fluxes break phase rigidity .",
    "the breakdown of phase rigidity in experiments on closed abi s shows up as deviations from the simple pure oscillation @xmath13 , even far away from resonances .",
    "such deviations already appeared in the pioneering work of webb _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite which demonstrated the ab oscillations in normal metal rings",
    ". in these experiments ( and in practically all the other experiments mentioned above ) , the ab oscillations appear on top of a background , whose slow variation with the magnetic flux has been described as an _ aperiodic fluctuation _ , due to the penetration of the magnetic field into conducting parts of the abi ring .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations have shown that such fluctuations do result from the fluxes which penetrate small areas within the finite width of the ring , whose properties fluctuate randomly .  @xcite as noted by imry ,  @xcite such fluctuations can be observed only at high fluxes , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ratio of the area of the conducting ring to the area of the hole inside it . as stone and imry  @xcite note , this background may also contain beats .",
    "however , we are not aware of a detailed theoretical analysis of such beats , or of any other _ periodic _ aspect of the deviations from a simple aharonov - bohm oscillation .    in the first part of this paper we concentrate on two aspects of the breakdown of phase rigidity .",
    "first , the beats. figure 2 of ref . already showed two main peaks in the power spectrum of the flux - dependent conductance : one at the aharonov - bohm period and the other at a much smaller period ( higher field ) . ignoring the aperiodic fluctuations , both periods are clearly visible in the flux dependence of the conductance . the ratio of the two periods is presumably related to the ratio between the areas of the ring and of the hole , @xmath15 .",
    "similar ` beats ' show up in practically all the experiments on closed abi s .",
    "@xcite the second aspect concerns the location of the conductance maxima and the related phase shift .",
    "figure 4 of the first reference in shows a contour plot of the conductance versus the gate voltage and the magnetic field . in its restricted sense",
    ", phase rigidity implies that ( except close to resonances ) the maxima should be at fixed fields , namely on lines parallel to the gate voltage axis .",
    "however , in the data ( taken at relatively high fields ) these lines have a non - zero slope relative to that axis .",
    "similar slopes show up in many similar experimental plots ( see e.g. fig . 4 in ref . , or",
    "fig . 4 of ref .",
    "a slow change of the location of the maxima with increasing magnetic fields is visible even in the original papers by yacoby _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite analysis of the data within a finite narrow window of fields ( away from zero ) would thus be described by @xmath16 , with a non - zero phase shift @xmath17 , which depends on both the flux and the gate voltage , apparently contradicting phase rigidity .",
    "( this behavior holds only at large fields ; as the field goes to zero , @xmath17 also vanishes , in accord with the onsager requirement . )",
    "all of these papers also exhibit a slow variation of the aharonov - bohm oscillation amplitude @xmath18 with increasing field , which is related to the ` beats ' .",
    "below we present some additional experimental data , and give a theoretical discussion of these observations .    the second part of this paper concerns the fano shape of the coulomb blockade resonances . in the coulomb blockade regime ,",
    "the qd exhibits a sequence of resonances as function of the gate voltage , whenever another electron is added to its bound states .",
    "the interference between these states and the continuum of the electrons in the leads then results in the fano effect ,  @xcite which modifies the shape of these resonances .",
    "these resonances are further modified once the qd is placed in the abi .",
    "@xcite in the experimental papers ,  @xcite each resonance has been fitted to the ` standard ' fano asymmetric breit - wigner form , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the normalized distance of the gate voltage from its resonance value and @xmath21 is the so - called ` fano asymmetry parameter ' , which can become complex at non - zero magnetic fluxes , when time - reversal symmetry is broken . below we show that _ all _ the asymmetric resonances follow from a _ single _ unified expression for the transmission amplitude , and present fits to the data which demonstrate the utility of this representation for many resonances .",
    "@xcite    section [ exp ] presents some new data , taken from the same mesoscopic closed abi described in ref . .",
    "section [ theory ] then proceeds to describe a simple theory , which takes account of the finite width of the ring .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ fits ] uses this theory to fit experimental data from the abi .",
    "for a quantitative discussion of the points listed above , we start by presenting some new data , taken from the same sample described in refs . .",
    "as explained there , the closed ring - shaped abi , shown in fig . [ sample ] , was fabricated by wet etching the 2deg at an algaas / gaas heterostructure .",
    "au / ti metallic gates define the qd and control the gate voltages on the qd ( sitting on the lower branch of the ring ) and on the reference ( upper ) branch .",
    "the sample was cooled by a dilution refrigerator , the base temperature of which was 30mk though the electron temperature measured from the line shape of the coulomb oscillation was around 100mk .",
    "are indicated .",
    "the contours a , b and c indicate possible paths of the electrons . ]",
    "all our data are found to be symmetric under @xmath22 , in agreement with the onsager relations . in order to investigate the nature of electronic paths in the ring geometry , we first connected all the gates to ground .",
    "the sample was hence a simple ring without a dot at this stage .",
    "figure [ osci ] shows a typical flux dependence of the conductance through the abi , for these grounding conditions .",
    "the data clearly show the aharonov - bohm oscillations , with a small period as demonstrated in the insets .",
    "in addition , apart from some aperiodic fluctuations , the data exhibit oscillations on a larger scale . to quantify these oscillations , fig . [ fft ]",
    "shows the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of these data .",
    "the top graph shows the fft of all the data .",
    "interestingly , the results between @xmath23250/t and @xmath23280/t seem to contain several separable peaks . the top graph also shows arrows for the aharonov - bohm periods associated with the contours a , b and c in fig .",

    "the maxima remain fixed at integer multiples of the flux unit , as follows from phase rigidity .",
    "in addition , maxima and minima can suddenly interchange between resonances , in a ` phase lapse ' which is attributed to a fano vanishing of the conductance .",

    "cplots ] never stay on lines parallel to the gate voltage axis . instead , they move continuously towards larger fields , indicating a non - zero phase shift @xmath17 .",
    "the variation of the maxima can be characterized by three typical forms , indicated by white arrows : in form a , the maximum moves almost linearly with the gate voltage , so that @xmath9 changes by @xmath5 , returning to the value it had before the previous resonance . in form b , one observes a fast change in the location of the maximum , about half way between the resonances .",
    "although reminiscent of the fano jump by @xmath5 , this change has a finite width and seems continuous . finally , in form c the maximum moves by @xmath5 over the resonance , but very soon it moves quickly back to its location before the resonance , so that the line of this maximum remains almost parallel to the gate voltage axis for a range of gate voltages .",

    "this means that the abi  ring \" surrounds a well defined unique area , which is penetrated by a _",

    "it is this uniqueness that then results in the periodicity of @xmath8 with @xmath9 , resulting with phase rigidity . to explain the deviation of our ( and practically everyone else s ) data from this periodicity",
    ", we note that the real rings are _ never _ 1d ( see fig . [ sample ] ) .",
    "@xcite due to the finite width of the abi ring , electrons which move on different paths within the ring surround different areas , and therefore different magnetic fluxes .",
    "@xcite we demonstrate the implications of these different fluxes by a simple tight - binding model , which generalizes models used earlier to describe the abi in the coulomb blockade regime .",

    "<S> although the conductance of a closed aharonov - bohm interferometer , with a quantum dot on one branch , obeys the onsager symmetry under magnetic field reversal , it needs not be a periodic function of this field : the conductance maxima move with both the field and the gate voltage on the dot , in an apparent breakdown of ` phase rigidity ' . </S>",
    "<S> these experimental findings are explained theoretically as resulting from multiple electronic paths around the interferometer ring . </S>",
    "<S> data containing several coulomb blockade peaks , whose shapes change with the magnetic flux , are fitted to a simple model , in which each resonant level on the dot couples to a different path around the ring . </S>"
