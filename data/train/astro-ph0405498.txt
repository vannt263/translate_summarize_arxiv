    "ulxs may represent the high - luminosity end of a continuous distribution of typical x - ray sources such as supernovae and x - ray binaries ( e.g. , grimm , glifanov , & sunyaev 2003 ) or they may include new classes of objects including intermediate mass black holes ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; makishima et al .  2000 ; colbert & ptak 2002 ; van  der  marel 2004 ) , beamed sources ( king et al .",

    "part of the reason ulxs are , as a class , poorly understood is that past x - ray observatories lack the combination of high angular resolution and moderate spectral resolution needed to adequately characterize discrete x - ray sources in nearby galaxies . the highest spatial resolution instruments aboard both _ einstein _  and _ rosat _  provide little or no spectral information and their spectroscopic instruments have poor angular resolution .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "satellite provides moderate spectral resolution but very poor angular resolution . as a result ,",
    "ulxs are difficult to resolve from other nearby x - ray sources and from diffuse emission in the field ; their positions and morphologies are poorly known thus impeding follow - up investigations in other wavebands ; and ulx x - ray spectra and timing properties are often sparsely sampled .",
    "we have undertaken an extensive x - ray spectrophotometric survey of the discrete source populations in nearby galaxy fields anchored upon archival data obtained with the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the main goal of the survey is to systematically search for and evaluate the physical properties of ulxs .",
    "the survey encompasses a sample of ulxs large enough for meaningful statistical analyses ; the survey is based upon high spatial resolution images that provide accurate celestial positions as well as medium - resolution broad - band spectral signatures and time sampling .",
    "the galaxies included in the survey span the range of hubble morphological types and include galaxies of various mass , gas content , dynamical state , and evolutionary history ; thus allowing correlations between ulxs and their local environments to be studied .    the galaxy selection process and",

    "the implications of the current survey for contemporary physical models for the ulx phenomena is discussed in  [ s : discussion ] .",
    "_ chandra_/acis , operating in imaging mode , provides moderate spectral resolution and throughput at the highest spatial resolution available in an x - ray telescope facility .",
    "as our primary goals are to obtain accurate celestial positions and to perform spectroscopic analysis of ulx candidates , acis is the ideal instrument for the present study . to achieve these goals requires a minimum of @xmath250 x - ray counts per source distributed over several spectral energy bins .",
    "thus , our sample includes nearly all available non - grating , timed exposure mode , acis galaxy observations ( those listing a galaxy or a supernova as a target in the _ chandra _  approved target lists ) publicly - available c.  may 2003 with 50 counts expected from sources with intrinsic 0.58.0 kev luminosities of @xmath8@xmath9@xmath7  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "ngc  221 , ngc  224 , and the magellanic clouds are the only galaxies purposely excluded from the sample . these galaxies are known to contain no ulxs and require multiple pointings for full coverage ( except for the dwarf elliptical ngc 221 ) .",
    "there were no non - targeted galaxies in the _ chandra _  fields that met the selection criterion .    for each candidate galaxy in the archive",
    ", the number of counts expected from a ulx was estimated using the portable interactive multi - mission simulator ( pimms , mukai 1993 ) ; the distance , @xmath10 , to the galaxy ; the duration , @xmath11 , of the observation ; and assuming an absorbed power law spectral shape with spectral index @xmath12 and with a hydrogen column density , @xmath13 , equal to the galactic column density along the line of sight .",

    "the _ chandra _  sample of galaxies is not expected to be complete to any specified limiting distance , magnitude , or other property .",
    "however , the _ chandra _  sample can be compared to , for example , the tully ( 1988 ) nearby galaxy catalogue of 2367 galaxies .",
    "the distribution of absolute blue magnitudes of the _ chandra _  sample of galaxies is compared in figure  [ f : cxo_tully.b ] to those of the 1768 galaxies in the tully catalogue with tabulated absolute blue magnitudes .",

    "thus , the _ chandra _  sample is comprised of nearby galaxies of large angular size and high blue luminosity compared to the tully catalogue of galaxies .",
    "the sample is also expected be more luminous in x - ray light as x - ray luminosity correlates with blue luminosity ( e.g. , fabbiano & trinchieri 1985 ; fabbiano 1989 ) though the correlation varies with morphological type and is nonlinear ( fabbiano & shapley 2002 ) . the departure of the _ chandra _  sample from the tully catalogue is not unexpected as the _ chandra _  sample represents an x - ray - selected sample .    in order to further assess the extent of any selection bias in the _ chandra _  sample , a subsample of galaxies having the same distribution of absolute @xmath26 magnitudes as tully - catalogued galaxies within @xmath10@xmath929  mpc was selected . in   [ s : hosts ] , this subset is used along with the full _ chandra _  sample of galaxies to study correlations between the ulx candidates and properties of their host galaxies .",

    "the @xmath27 colors of the _ chandra _  sample all fall within the range of 0.5 to 1.0 mag . therefore , although blue light is more sensitive to the properties of the stellar population of the host galaxy than is visible light , the blue luminosity is used here as a proxy for galaxy mass with an estimated factor of two uncertainty assuming @xmath61  mass . on the other hand ,",
    "a galaxy s far - infrared luminosity is proportional to its recent star formation rate ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the distribution of the sample of galaxies in blue and far - infrared luminosity is shown in figure  [ f : bvf ] .",
    "elliptical galaxies tend to cluster near the upper left in this figure indicative of a relatively high mass but little or no recent star formation .",
    "in contrast , spiral galaxies span from lower - left to upper - right showing a general trend of star formation rate proportional to galaxy mass .",
    "it is also evident that spirals have a higher star formation rate per unit mass ( blue light ) compared to the ellipticals .",
    "approximately 3400 x - ray sources were detected above a signal - to - noise ratio of 2.8 ( resulting in @xmath5010  c per source and much less than 1 false detection per field ) within the @xmath24  areas of the 82 galaxies analyzed . among these",

    "the subset of ulx candidates is complete to the extent that the derived luminosities ( and hence adopted distances ) are correct .",
    "the completeness level of the 357 sources with spectral fits made can be estimated as the luminosity where their cumulative luminosity function begins to flatten .",
    "this occurs at @xmath8@xmath2@xmath62  ergs  s@xmath1  with about 20% lying below this completeness level .",
    "these lower - luminosity sources tend to be those from nearby galaxies with deep exposures but are otherwise not expected to differ from sources above the completeness limit .",
    "the lowest luminosity of a source for which spectral parameters have been established is @xmath63  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "the luminosities for the first group were estimated from the number of detected counts in the manner described in   [ s : methods_galselect ] and are therefore much more uncertain than for the other two source populations .",
    "the completeness level for this population , based on its cumulative luminosity function is also @xmath2@xmath62  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "more importantly for this population , however , is that there are sufficient counts detected for analyzing their x - ray colors and timing properties without overwhelming statistical uncertainties .",
    "thus , this population is limited to sources with @xmath5050  c detected .",
    "the 3-parameter absorbed power law model provides one of the simplest phenomonological descriptions of x - ray spectra .",
    "this model was applied to the observed spectra to constrain the observed and intrinsic luminosities of the sources ( see also   [ s : pegpwrlw ] above ) and to establish their basic spectral shapes .",
    "statistically - acceptable ( @xmath5090% confidence ) fits were obtained using this model for 83% ( 298 of 357 ) of sources for which spectral parameters have been determined and for 130 ( 84% ) of the ulx candidates .",
    "this does not imply that a power law is the only acceptable model for these spectra nor that a power law fully describes the physical mechanism(s ) responsible for the observed x - ray emission .",
    "indeed , an absorbed thermal emission line ( mekal ) model , for example , results in an acceptable fit to @xmath278% of the sources analyzed .",
    "the fitted power law indices of the ulx candidates with statistically - acceptable power - law fits are compared in figure  [ f : bingamma ] to the weaker sources .",
    "overall , the distributions are very similar and can be described by the same gaussian shape .",
    "however , there is a significant population of sources ( 20 of 130 ) with @xmath643 in the ulx population that does not have a counterpart in the sample of weaker sources ( 7 of 168 ) .",
    "closer inspection showed that sources with a steep power law index often also required a high absorbing column density that compensates for an observed spectral rollover toward low energies .",
    "the average column density is @xmath65@xmath9@xmath66  @xmath6 for ulx candidates with @xmath64@xmath503 compared to @xmath67 for the @xmath64@xmath683 sources .",
    "the ultimate effect is to promote steep power law sources with low _ observed _ luminosities into the high _ intrinsic _ luminosity ulx candidate category .",
    "in contrast , thermal models such as the mekal model have a natural rollover at low energies , do not require as large an absorbing column density , and result in a lower intrinsic luminosity .",
    "this trend is illustrated in the upper panel of figure  [ f : lmlpvsgamma ] where the ratio of the intrinsic luminosity derived using the mekal model to that derived using the power law model is shown against the power law index .",

    "the difference in derived intrinsic luminosities increases rapidly with increasing @xmath64 . for the bulk of the sources modeled ( those with @xmath64@xmath21.8 ) however",

    "this systematic effect helps explain the high-@xmath64 tail apparent in the ulx candidate population of figure  [ f : bingamma ] but lacking in the lower luminosity source population . applying the mekal model to the 20 ulx and 7 non - ulx sources with @xmath64@xmath69 and acceptable power law fits resulted in mekal - derived intrinsic luminosities @xmath38@xmath7  ergs  s@xmath1  for 17 of the 27 sources .",
    "these 17 are denoted in table  2 .",
    "thus , adopting the mekal luminosities would result in similar high-@xmath64 distributions for both populations .",
    "the lack , at the outset , of steep power law sources in the non - ulx population is due to the relatively low number of counts in the 0.58.0 kev band for this spectral shape combined with the fact that low - count sources were not selected for spectral analysis .",
    "however , the x - ray color analysis of   [ s : results_colors ] shows that there are sources with colors equivalent to a steep power law in the low - count population .",
    "it is evident that more than one spectral model often provides statistically - acceptable fits to the observed x - ray spectra .",
    "often these models ostensibly represent quite different physical emission mechanisms .",
    "for example , physical models of x - ray phenomena that predict `` soft '' x - radiation , corresponding to a steep power law index , are cool thermal emission sources ( lower panel , figure  [ f : lmlpvsgamma ] ) , such as supernovae , while phenomena that can be characterized as non - thermal , such as synchrotron emission from a power - law distribution of electrons or comptonization , tend to result in relatively flat power law indices .",
    "thus , while either model is statistically - acceptable , it is reasonable to _ assume _ that the majority of the steep power law sources are thermal sources .",
    "many of these may be supernovae though three @xmath64@xmath503 sources are among the most variable x - ray sources in the ulx sample ( table 2 and   [ s : results_timing ] ) .",
    "one of these is a known super - soft source in ngc  5457 ( mukai et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "having established that both the power law and the mekal models predict similar luminosities for the majority of sources ( those near @xmath64@xmath21.8 ) and that both models effectively disriminate between `` soft '' and `` hard '' x - ray spectra , it remains to chose one or both models ( or some other ) as a baseline .",
    "the power law is arguably the easier to grasp conceptually and requires the fewest number of parameters .",
    "therefore , the absorbed power law model fit parameters and derived luminosities are reported in table  2 whenever this model provided a statistically - acceptable fit .",
    "additional models applied to sources not well - fit by an absorbed power law were thermal emission line models ( mekal or vmekal ) , disk blackbody models ( diskbb ) and combinations of these three ( including power law ) basic spectral models . of the 24 ulx candidates poorly fit by the absorbed power - law model , 11 were acceptably - fit using 1 or 2component thermal emission line models , 9 using disk blackbody models , and 4 were not well - fit by any of the trial spectral models .",
    "parameters for these models are reported in table  2 ( the power law parameters are quoted for the 4 spectra with no acceptable fits ) .",
    "figure  [ f : gammavscts ] shows the value of the power law spectral index , @xmath64 , against the number of detected source counts and figure  [ f : gammavsl ] displays @xmath64 against the derived intrinsic source luminosity .",
    "not surprisingly , sources for which the simple absorbed power law model was unacceptable tend to be those sources with a high number of detected counts ( e.g. , a power law is unacceptable for 39% of the 51 sources with @xmath501000 detected counts compared to only 8% of 177 sources with @xmath38200 detected counts ) .",
    "the average value of the power law index , @xmath70 , for sources with statistically - acceptable power law fits , are 1.79@xmath560.09 ( for sources with @xmath38137  c ) , 1.78@xmath560.07 ( 137 to 268  c ) , and 1.75@xmath560.03 ( @xmath50268  c ) where the 3 ranges were chosen to contain equal numbers of sources .",
    "similarly , @xmath70 is displayed in figure  [ f : gammavsl ] for the ulx candidates ( 1.74@xmath560.03 ) , and for the weaker sources ( 1.77@xmath560.04 above the completeness limit and 1.76@xmath560.10 for sources below @xmath62",

    "the dispersion of @xmath64 about the mean value is @xmath37@xmath91.18 for the ulx candidates and 0.43 for the non - ulx sources .",
    "the steep power law sources account for the larger dispersion in the ulx candidates population . restricting the range to @xmath64@xmath383 results in @xmath37@xmath90.51 and 0.40 for the two groups .",

    "colors of absorbed power law model spectra ( for sources imaged on back - illuminated ccds ) are also shown for reference as solid curves .",
    "the front - illuminated devices have relatively lower response in the soft band so that similar curves for these devices do not extend to such low values of @xmath42 . nevertheless , the differences are typically much less than the uncertainties in the x - ray colors .",
    "highly - absorbed sources lie near ( 1,0 ) and super - soft sources near ( 0,-1 ) in these figures .",
    "the colors of steep power law sources are constrained along a narrow band extending from the super - soft source location at ( 0,-1 ) upwards and to the left towards @xmath2(-0.6,0.5 ) .",

    "the k - s test is sensitive to long term variability even when the data has been finely binned .",
    "this is in contrast to other methods which often have an optimal binning typically of the same order as the variability timescale under consideration .",

    "as displayed in figure  [ f : ks1 ] , the distributions are themselves cumulative distribution functions and applying the kolmogorov - smirnov test to compare these two distributions shows that they are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution ( @xmath86 ) .",

    "fits to the smaller subsets of spirals or ellipticals give large ranges to the fit parameter values when all parameters are allowed to vary .",

    "if ulx emission is beamed and weaker sources are not , then one would expect the two populations to have different spectral indices .",
    "while the spectral shape of the majority of the ulx candidates are consistent with power laws , their spectral indices do not differ from the less luminous population .",

    "the high mass transfer rates implied for the mildly beamed sources ( king et al .  2001 ; kalogera et al .",

    "however , thermal - timescale mass transfer occurs when the main - sequence mass - donor ( companion ) star is more massive than the compact accretor .",

    "supernovae display the distinct thermal emission - line x - ray spectrum from shock - heated plasma ; often with a harder bremsstrahlung component from a forward shock .",

    "[ s : results_spectra ] , about 15% of the ulx candidates with acceptable power law fits have steep slopes , @xmath643 , suggesting a thermal spectrum .",
    "thus , at least 22% of the ulx candidates are likely thermal sources .",
    "the actual number could be higher since a thermal model does provide a formally - acceptable fit to 78% of the ulx candidates . nevertheless , it is unlikely that the majority of ulx candidates are thermal sources since the average power law model slope of 1.8 ( or the average thermal model temperature of 18.4  kev ) is much more descriptive of non - thermal sources .",
    "supernovae should be steady sources on short timescales and decline slowly over periods of months to years . again , while results of variability tests are consistent with the majority of ulx candidates being steady sources , individual observations are too short to discern long - term trends and some low - level variability may be hidden in the low - count light curves .",

    "core collapse supernovae have massive star progenitors consistent with the association of ulxs with late - type star - forming galaxies .",
    "it has long been known ( david , jones , & forman 1992 ) and recently confirmed ( ranalli , comastri , & setti 2002 ; grimm , gilfanov , & sunyaev 2003 ) that the total x - ray luminosity of a galaxy correlates with recent star formation rate as measured by its far - infrared luminosity , @xmath52 .",

    "a similar conclusion can be indirectly deduced through studies of the cumulative x - ray luminosity functions of nearby galaxies : the flat slopes of the xlfs implies that the most luminous sources dominate the total x - ray luminosity of spiral and starburst galaxies ( e.g. , kilgard et al .",

    "( 2001 ) as a reasonable representation of the _ majority _ of ulxs .",
    "does the model of king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) provide a viable explanation for the results of the present survey ?",
    "the model is essentially that of a high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxrb ) undergoing an episode of thermal - timescale mass transfer .",

    "particulars of the mass transfer mechanism , possibilities of common envelope formation , and details of beaming and resulting luminosities are beyond the scope of the present work .",

    "thus , the number of ulxs in high @xmath52  galaxies follows the trend expected for a short - lived high stellar mass origin .",
    "leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) also predict a peak massive - star supernova rate of 0.02  yr@xmath1 at a sfr of 1  m@xmath130  yr@xmath1 which will also contribute to the ulx population of active star - forming galaxies in proportion to @xmath52 .    for lower @xmath52 , and particularly for elliptical galaxies , the number of ulxs is larger than this simple estimate predicts .",

    "this is consistent with what is inferred from the ulx cumulative luminosity function for ellipticals , figure  [ f : lf ] : there is one ulx per 100 x - ray sources above 6.3@xmath156@xmath152  ergs  s@xmath1 . of order 100",
    "x - ray sources per @xmath51@xmath9@xmath150  ergs  s@xmath1  are routinely detected above a few @xmath152  ergs  s@xmath1 in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4697 , sarazin et al .",

    "the average blue luminosity of the elliptical galaxies in our sample is @xmath157 ( figure  [ f : bvf ] ) .",
    "thus , the observed rate of @xmath22 ulx candidates per elliptical galaxy ( or 1 ulx candidate per @xmath51@xmath9@xmath150  ergs  s@xmath1 ) is consistent with a lmxrb origin .",
    "the actual number is somewhat less since nearly 50% of the ulx candidates in elliptical galaxies are potentially background sources (   [ s : bgsrcs ] ) but this line of reasoning suggests that the dominant factor determining the slope of the cumulative x - ray luminosity function for ellipticals is simply the lifetimes of the lmxrbs .",
    "low - mass xrbs also exist in spiral galaxies .",
    "however , inspection of figure  [ f : bvf ] shows that , for spirals , @xmath51  is more a measure of the young stellar content than of the total number of stars ( or galaxy mass ) .",
    "thus , while the contribution of lmxrbs to the ulx population is expected to scale with galaxy mass , it may not vary linearly with @xmath51  for spirals in the present sample .",
    "colbert et al .  ( 2004 ) used @xmath26 and @xmath21 luminosities as a measure of galaxy mass to conclude that more than 20% of ulxs in spiral galaxies originate from the older stellar population .",

    "( 2004 ) show that x - ray point source populations can also be described as a superposition of contributions from these two stellar populations . here",
    "it has been shown that the ulx candidate population also displays this dichotomy .",
    "considering ulxs as a subset of all x - ray sources or , equivalently , as a subset of the total x - ray luminosity of a galaxy , this result supports the idea that ulxs are the high - luminosity end of a distribution of hmxrbs and supernovae and of lmxrbs .",
    "x - ray properties and celestial positions of a sample of 154 ulx candidates have been tabulated .",
    "the x - ray properties alone are unable to discriminate between ulxs and the less - lumious population ( to a formal completeness limit of @xmath2@xmath62  ergs  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "this could perhaps be foreseen since , for example , the power law indices of accreting x - ray sources ranging from stellar - mass neutron stars and black holes to supermassive active galactic nuclei are , on average , comparable to the mean power law index , @xmath64@xmath91.74@xmath560.03 , obtained here for ulx candidates . based on spectral shape , namely a steep power law index or , equivalently , a cool plasma temperature , about 20% of the ulx candidates are potentially supernovae but this group also includes a few variable and/or supersoft sources .",
    "the supersoft ( or ` quasisoft ' ) spectra may be a signature of imbhs as these objects are expected to have a soft blackbody disk component . most of the sources studied here , however , can be described by a simple power law and do not require an additional ( soft ) thermal component .",
    "future spectrophotometric x - ray observations will help distinguish between transient xrbs and slowly - evolving young supernovae but optical and radio data ( and rapidly - sampled x - ray timing data ) will be needed to discern , e.g. , beamed sources from imbhs .",

    "chandra _  should be a tremendous aid to such followup observations .",
    "the number of ulx candidates per galaxy is roughly the same for spirals and ellipticals but the luminosities of the ulxs are @xmath210 times higher in spirals compared to ellipticals and the ulx candidate population in ellipticals is severely compromised by background sources ( estimated to be 44% in the present sample compared to only 14% for spirals ) .",
    "there is also a strong correlation between the number and average luminosity of ulxs in spirals and their host galaxy s far - infrared luminosity ; and a weaker ( anti-)correlation with nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "the x - ray data do not favor any particular model for ulx phenomena .",
    "the similarity to properties of weaker sources strongly suggests ulxs are not a distinct class but composed of a heterogeneous mixture as are the weaker sources ; in which case all models remain viable on a case by case basis .",
    "the association with recent star formation , and the significant lack of bright ulxs in elliptical galaxies , does make a strong case for young , short - lived , systems such as hmxrbs as the dominant component of the more luminous ulx population . on the other hand ,",
