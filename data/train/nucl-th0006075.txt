    "already in the 1950 s k. watson @xcite and a. migdal @xcite have shown that the energy dependence for meson production reactions @xmath2 near threshold is predominantly determined by the strong @xmath3 interaction in the final state .",
    "their arguments have been used for justifying a rather simple treatment of effects from the final state interaction ( fsi ) ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it consists in simply multiplying the basic production amplitude with the on - shell @xmath3 @xmath4-matrix , i. e. @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath3 phase shift , @xmath7 the @xmath3 scattering length , @xmath8 the on - shell meson production amplitude and @xmath9 a normalization factor .",
    "this expression suggests that the fsi effect is universal , i. e. does not depend on the specific meson emitted .",
    "recently , some aspects of fsi effects in the reaction @xmath10 were investigated by hanhart and nakayama @xcite and niskanen @xcite .",
    "in particular , these authors pointed out that the evaluation of the total reaction amplitude by just multiplying the production amplitude by the on - shell @xmath3  @xmath4-matrix is not acceptable for obtaining quantitative predictions . in the present paper",
    "we want to study those fsi effects in more detail .",
    "specifically , we want to shed some light on the validity of the multiplication prescription eq .",
    "( [ mtot ] ) .",
    "we examine the influence of the @xmath3 fsi on the absolute value of the reaction amplitude by employing realistic models of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "furthermore we investigate the dependence of the fsi effects on the mass of the produced meson . for that purpose",
    "we will vary the mass of @xmath11 and adopt values corresponding to those of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath0 mesons .",
    "in general the total amplitude for the reaction @xmath14 can be determined from the dwba expression @xmath15 where the term on the very right side implies an integration over the off - shell production amplitude and the off - shell @xmath3 @xmath4-matrix .",
    "( [ mgen ] ) corresponds to the sum of the two diagrams shown in fig .",
    "meson production in @xmath3 collisions requires a large momentum transfer between the initial and final nucleons which is typically of the order of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the nucleon mass and @xmath18 the mass of produced meson .",
    "thus the range of the production interaction will be much smaller than the characteristic range of the @xmath3 interaction in the final state .",
    "goldberger and watson argued that in such a case the meson can be considered to be produced practically from a point like region so that the production amplitude can be factored out of the integral @xcite , i.e. @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the ( suitably normalized ) @xmath3 wave function in the continuum @xcite , where @xmath21 is related to the jost function @xmath22 via @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "clearly also in this case one arrives at results where the fsi effects are reduced to a mere multiplicative factor @xmath24 ( commonly referred to as enhancement factor ) .    the prescription eq .",
    "( [ mdru ] ) has been utilized by several authors @xcite in their studies of meson production .",
    "its validity has been examined by an explicit calculation of the loop diagram in ref .",
    "@xcite employing an @xmath25 model for the production amplitude .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that this investigation is based on a simple separable yamaguchi potential for the @xmath3 fsi .",
    "it is well - known that the off - shell behavior of the @xmath4-matrix for the yamaguchi potential is rather different from the one resulting from realistic models of the @xmath3 force .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we compare the off - shell properties of the paris @xcite and ( one version of ) the bonn @xcite @xmath3 models with the one of the yamaguchi potential for the @xmath26 partial wave .",
    "the most striking difference is definitely the zero crossing of the @xmath4-matrix that occurs for realistic potential models at off - shell momenta @xmath27 mev / c whereas the one of the yamaguchi potential never changes sign . as we will show below , this specific feature has a strong and important influence on the result for the fsi effects .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in sect .",
    "2 we present our formalism .",
    "we specify the meson production amplitude that we use in the present investigation and we give the explicit expression for the loop diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . in sect .",
    "3 we present and discuss our results . specifically , we show calculations for the effects of the fsi considering different @xmath3 models and the production of mesons with different masses . furthermore we take a look at the energy dependence of the fsi effects and examine the validity of some commonly used approximations .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "for the calculation of the loop diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig1]b with off - shell amplitudes of realistic @xmath3 interactions we need to specify a model for the production amplitude .",
    "we assume that it has the form @xmath28 which corresponds to the exchange of a scalar meson @xmath29 of mass @xmath30 in the @xmath31-channel followed by the production of a meson @xmath11 in a rescattering process .",
    "the corresponding diagram is shown in fig .",
    "the coupling @xmath32 at the @xmath33 vertex and the amplitude @xmath34 are assumed to be constants .",
    "for @xmath30 we take the value of the pion mass , i.e. @xmath30 = 135 mev . furthermore , for simplicity reasons , we use non - relativistic kinematics for the intermediate nucleons . the total reaction amplitude for this production model is then given by the sum of the two diagrams of fig .",

    "@xmath39 is given by the expression @xmath40}{r }   \\int^{\\infty}_0\\frac{dqq \\ t_{nn}(q , k)}{[q^2-k^2-i0 ] } \\",

    "@xmath42 is the @xmath3 half - off - shell t - matrix in the @xmath26 partial wave .",
    "the function @xmath43 can be considered as a generalization of the fsi enhancement factor @xmath44 that follows from the factorization assumption eq .",
    "( [ mdru ] ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that ( contrary to @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ mdru ] ) ) @xmath39 does contain also information on the production mechanism and not only on the @xmath3 fsi .    in the actual calculations we want to include the coulomb interaction between the outgoing protons .",
    "therefore we have to replace the @xmath3 half - off - shell @xmath4-matrix in eq .",
    "( [ summ1 ] ) by the quantity @xmath46 , i.e. the coulomb - distorted hadronic @xmath4-matrix .",
    "this quantity is obtained by the prescription introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely via @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the on - shell and off - shell momentum , respectively . @xmath50 and @xmath42 are the on - shell and half - off - shell @xmath4-matrices for the strong interaction alone .",
    "the coulomb penetration factor @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 the fine - structure constant .",
    "furthermore , the first term on the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ summ1 ] ) ( the `` 1 '' ) has to be replaced by @xmath54 .",
    "first we want to discuss the dependence of @xmath55 on the mass of the produced meson . for that purpose",
    "we start out from a somewhat simpler expression for @xmath56 which follows from eq .",
    "( [ summ1 ] ) for the kinematics at the production threshold : @xmath57}{\\sqrt{mm_x+m_x^2/4 } } \\int^{\\infty}_0\\frac{dqq \\ t^{cs}_{nn}(q , k)}{[q^2-k^2-i0 ] } \\   ln[\\frac{(q+\\tilde r)^2+\\tilde\\lambda^2}{(q-\\tilde r)^2+\\tilde\\lambda^2 } ] \\ , \\label{summ2}\\ ] ] where @xmath58    for the production of a light meson , @xmath59 , we get @xmath60 , @xmath61 , so that there is a dependence of the integral on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ summ2 ] ) on @xmath18 . in the case of a heavy meson , @xmath62",
    ", it follows that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and consequently @xmath55 does not depend on the mass of the emitted meson @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , we expect that fsi effects are getting universal for the production of heavy mesons via an obe - type production mechanism eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "let us now come to the results for the fsi factor @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show calculations for different @xmath3 models and for some typical masses of the emitted meson @xmath11 .",
    "it can be seen from those figures that the magnitudes of @xmath66 resulting for the bonn and the paris potentials are fairly similar whereas the one for the separable yamaguchi potential is quite different .",
    "( note that different scales are used for each @xmath3 model ! ) this result can be understood qualitatively from the features of the corresponding off - shell t - matrices shown in fig .",
    "the t - matrices for the bonn and paris potentials are very similar .",
    "in particular , for both models there is a change of sign at an off - shell momentum of @xmath67 350 mev / c . because of",
    "this change of sign cancellations occur in the integral for @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ summ1 ] )",
    ". the off - shell t - matrix of the yamaguchi potential does not change sign .",
    "therefore , no such cancellations take place in the integration and as a consequence the fsi factor @xmath66 is significantly larger than the ones for the realistic interaction models , cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "there is also a striking difference in the results with regard to the mass of the emitted meson . for the paris and bonn potentials the fsi factor decreases with increasing mass of the produced meson .",
    "however , for the yamaguchi potential we observe the opposite effect . here",
    "@xmath68 becomes larger with the mass of the produced meson .",
    "these features can again be understood in terms of the @xmath3 off - shell properties .",
    "however , now the off - shell behavior of the production amplitude , that enters into the integral ( [ summ1 ] ) as well , becomes also relevant . with increasing mass of the produced meson the required momentum transfer @xmath31 increases as well and , accordingly , the production mechanism gets more and more short - ranged . as a consequence",
    "the production amplitude remains a constant over a larger ( off - shell ) momentum range , as can be seen in fig .",
    "this feature enhances the cancellation effects for the bonn and paris @xmath3 t - matrices , discussed above , and therefore leads to a reduction of @xmath66 for larger meson masses . in case of the yamaguchi",
    "potential no such cancellations can occur and therefore the fsi factor turns out to be almost independent of the mass of the produced meson .",
    "nevertheless , we see that also for realistic @xmath3 potentials the fsi factors become more and more similar with increasing mass of the produced meson , i.e. for high momentum transfers .",
    "this is expected .",
    "it simply reflects the universality of fsi effects for the production of heavy mesons as discussed above .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the universality of fsi effects at large @xmath31 should set in not only for the particular production amplitude used in the present investigation ( cf .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) ) , but is expected to occur in general .",
    "actually , we examined the behavior of @xmath66 for the obe - type production amplitude eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) with inclusion of form factors of monopole and dipole type at the @xmath33 vertex .",
    "corresponding numerical calculations clearly indicate that the qualitative behaviour of the fsi factors remains basically unchanged",
    ".    however , it is important to realize that the actual values for the fsi factors do , of course , depend on the particular production amplitude .",
    "thus , the results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] are _ by not means",
    "_ absolute predictions that can be taken from this paper and used blindly for fsi corrections in any other study of meson production . rather our results demonstrate that fsi effects have to be calculated always explicitly , utilizing the respective production amplitudes and a proper @xmath3 off - shell t - matrix , if one wants to obtain reliable quantitative predictions .",
    "( in this context we also would like to draw attention to the requirement of a consistent treatment of both the @xmath3 scattering and production amplitudes as discussed in the appendix of ref .",
    "specifically , this means that the apparent universality of the fsi effects for large meson masses _ does not _ imply that one can use the prescription applied in the studies @xcite , i.e. take the production amplitude out of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ summ2 ] ) . even though the factor @xmath55 becomes independent of the mass of the produced meson its actual magnitude is still determined by the off - shell properties of the @xmath3 t - matrix as well as by the production amplitude . in order to demonstrate this we show",
    "also results based on the factorization assumption eq .",
    "( [ mdru ] ) ( dash - dotted curves ) . in this case",
    "the fsi factor is simply given by the enhancement factor @xmath69 .",
    "it is really startling how strongly the results for the yamaguchi potential and for realistic @xmath3 interaction models differ .",
    "for the former potential the enhancement factor based on the jost function is larger than the fsi factor obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mgen ] ) whereas for the latter models it turns out to be much smaller than the dwba values .",
    "clearly , these results suggest that it is rather questionable to use the jost function of some arbitrary potentials for the evaluation of fsi effects in meson - production reactions @xcite .",
    "finally a remark on the differences between the results for realistic @xmath3 models .",
    "obviously these are small ( about 20 % ) for the pion - production case .",
    "but for the @xmath70 meson the paris result is almost a factor 2 larger then the one for the bonn model .",
    "this is not too surprising because for the production of heavier mesons a larger momentum transfer is required and therefore the features of the @xmath3 interaction at shorter distances ( or larger off - shell momenta ) become more and more important in the actual calculations . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] there are fairly large differences in the off - shell properties of these two models for large off - shell momenta .",
    "note that such a sensitivity to the off - shell behaviour of realistic @xmath3 models at large off - shell momenta has been also seen , e.g. , in proton - proton bremsstrahlung producing hard photons @xcite .",
    "by all the variations we see in the magnitudes of the fsi factors presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we would like to point out that their energy dependence is basically the same for all the different potentials and for the different meson masses . if we normalize them to the same value for small @xmath48 ( e. g. , at the peak of @xmath66 at @xmath71 20 mev / c ) all curves would lie essentially on top of each other .",
    "this means that the energy dependence of the fsi factors is really primarily determined by the on - shell @xmath3 t - matrix .",
    "consequently , the on - shell prescription eq .",
    "( [ mtot ] ) is indeed a fairly good approximation , at least for energies near the production threshold . in order to demonstrate this",
    "let us compare one of the curves based on the paris potential with the result corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ mtot ] ) ( normalized to the paris curve at @xmath71 20 mev / c ) , cf .",
    "none - the - less , we do observe an increasing difference between these two curves for @xmath72 50 mev / c , which corresponds to excess ( cms ) energies @xmath73 3 mev . for @xmath48 = 100",
    "mev / c ( @xmath74 10 mev ) the curves differ already by a factor of around 2 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the jost function approach ( eq . ( [ mdru ] ) ) deviates even more strongly from the correct results than the on - shell approximation in the energy range @xmath75 100 mev / c .",
    "let us now investigate the origin of those discrepancies in more detail .",
    "for that purpose we re - write the amplitude @xmath76 eq .",
    "( [ mgen ] ) in the form given in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath77 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & -a_{prod}^{on}\\frac{e^{i\\delta}\\sin\\delta}{ka_{pp } } \\cdot   [ p(k)+1 - 1/2a_{pp}r_0k^2+o(k^4)+ ... ] \\label{pk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath78 is proportional to the principal value of the loop integral ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) and contains the information on the off - shell behavior of both @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "( note that we have neglected corrections coming from the coulomb interaction in eq .",
    "( [ pk ] ) for simplicity reasons .",
    "those terms do nt play a role anymore at the energies were the discrepancies discussed above occur . )    evidently corrections to the simple on - shell prescription eq .",
    "( [ mtot ] ) come from the energy dependence of the function @xmath78 as well as from the @xmath81 term .",
    "actual calculations with the @xmath3 potentials utilized in the present study revealed that the value of @xmath78 at @xmath48 = 0 is positive and about 3 to 5 units large which makes it to be the dominant piece of the terms in the bracket of eq .",
    "( [ pk ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath78 is slowly decreasing with @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath82 term is slowly increasing with @xmath48 ( note that @xmath83 is negative for the @xmath26 partial wave ! ) so that there is a compensation in the energy dependence of the terms in the brackets of eq .",
    "( [ pk ] ) .",
    "this circumstance is certainly partly responsible for the fact that eq .",
    "( [ mtot ] ) works relatively well .",
    "as already mentioned above , the value at @xmath84 is positive and fairly large ( cf . also the comments in ref .",
    "note that in order to get eq . ( [ mtot ] ) with the normalization @xmath9 set to one , as chosen in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have to assume that @xmath85 and omit all the terms proportional to @xmath82 , @xmath86 , etc .",
    ", in the square brackets on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ pk ] ) .",
    "therefore , this particular normalization can be only obtained under very specific conditions , cf .",
    "the discussion in the appendix of ref .",
    "in the present paper we have studied some aspects of effects from the final state interaction in the meson - production reaction @xmath10 near threshold .",
    "specifically , we have demonstrated that the nucleon - nucleon fsi can not be factorized from the production amplitude if one wants to obtain reliable quantitative predictons .",
    "this conclusion confirms the arguments given in the paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that the absolute value of the fsi factor depends on the momentum transfer , i. e. on the mass of the produced meson .",
    "it is not universal ! only for large momentum transfers , i. e. for the production of heavy mesons , the fsi factor is getting independent of the mass of the produced meson .",
    "finally , we have shown that the use of the jost function of some arbitrary potentials for the evaluation of fsi effects is rather questionable and may lead to a considerable over - estimation of those fsi effects .",
