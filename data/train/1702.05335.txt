    "blazars are active galactic nuclei with a relativistic jet pointing in the observer direction .",
    "they are highly variable in all spectral bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and periodicities for these sorces have been hypothesized since the discovery of the first members of the class . yet ,",
    "no fully convincing case has been identified , with the possible exception of oj287 , with a reported 12 year period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that appears rather robust , but not uncontroversial ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years it has become also clear that blazars are the main constituents of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray sky and the _ fermi _ mission since its launch has monitored the entire celestial sphere every 3 hours .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-ray light curves of blazars are becoming easily available @xcite , opening the possibility to look for periodicities in multiple and independent bands .",
    "in addition , robotic telescopes often developed for the monitorig of high - energy transients as gamma - ray bursts , are now operational since almost a decade , providing a large amount of homogeneous data that can fruitfully be analyzed for identifying long - term oscillations .",
    "one of these small - size robotic facilities is the rapid eye mount ( rem , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) telescope ( fig.[figrem ] ) located at the eso premise of la silla since 2004 and since then devoting a large fraction of the available observing time to blazar monitoring in the southern hemisphere ( fig.[figlc ] ) .",
    "our team derived and analyzed the rem data for six bl lac objects : pks0537 - 441 , pks0735 + 17 , oj287 , pks2005 - 489 , pks2155 - 304 , and wcomae , and of the flat spectrum radio quasar pks1510 - 089 @xcite .",
    "for some of the monitored sources , a search for periodicity has been carried out with optical , from rem and other facilities , and high - energy _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "we recently also performed analogous analyses on three bl lac objects in the northen sky ( 0716 + 714 , mrk421 and bllac , * ? ? ? * ) and similar investigations have been proposed by other teams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "generally speaking , in a fair fraction of the analyzed sources , possible periodicities at year time - scale have been singled out ( fig.[figper ] ) .",
    "days is indicated .",
    "95% and 99% significance curves derived from the local noise model ( dashed line ) are also shown . ]",
    "the proposed quasi - periodicities correspond to peaks in the power density spectra that stand out of the local structured noise rather clearly .",
    "however , once a correction for the `` trial - factors '' due to the large number of frequencies analyzed is applied , the global significance of the periods turns out to be rather low .",
    "the whole subject is rather complex and widely discussed in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a proper treatment of the statistical significance of the discussed quasi - periodicities will be subject of a forthcoming paper . at this stage",
    "it is enough to consider that , beyond any correct evaluation of the chance probabilities for these findings , we observe that in several cases there is a coincidence , within the errors , of the same periods in independent bands as the optical and gamma - rays .",
    "this suggests that there could be a physical meaning associated to these periods worth discussing in some detail .",
    "for a few sources low - significance periodicities simultaneously present in the optical and in the gamma - rays have been identified , enforcing their possible physical relevance .",
    "the convincing cases are pks2155 - 304 @xcite , pg1553 + 11 @xcite , pks0537 - 447 @xcite and bllac @xcite .",
    "these oscillations could be directly related to a real periodicity , as the orbital one of a system of two binary supermassive black holes , or indirectly as being due to an accretion disc / jet precession .",
    "blazar emissions are characterized by a chaotic component with superimposed a possible periodicity , which is therefore possibly hidden and difficult to single out if , as it is typically the case , the data are unevenly sampled and the time - series have of course a finite length .",
    "furthermore , the fact that optical observation campaigns on a blazar are basically activated in case of a high state of the source introduces another complicating factor .",
    "recently , year - like periodicities have been searched for quasars starting from various surveys , detecting several positive candidate cases among hundred thousands objects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . therefore , there could be a remarkable difference with respect to bright _ fermi _ blazars in terms of fraction of quasi - periodicity detections with roughly a year time - scale .",
    "if this will be proved to be true it could be related with the main characteristic that distinguishes them from quasars , the presence of a relativistic jet pointing in the observer direction .",
    "the net effect would be to obviously amplify the visibility of the oscillations , since it can magnify the variability through known relativistic effects .",
    "furthermore , as already mentioned , it is possible that the oscillations are due to jet instabilities , independent of the presence of a binary companion ."
