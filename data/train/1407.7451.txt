    "the high density of colour charges , present in a plasma of quarks and gluons ( qgp ) created in heavy - ion collisions , is expected to screen the binding between heavy ( charm or beauty ) @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks , suppressing the production of quarkonium states with respect to the production in  @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", the different binding energies of the various @xmath8 states should lead to a sequential suppression pattern , where , in case of charmonium resonances , the more loosely bound @xmath0  melts at lower temperatures with respect to the more tightly bound j/@xmath4 .",
    "the na50 experiment has indeed observed a stronger @xmath0  suppression relative to the j/@xmath4  one in collisions at @xmath9 gev  @xcite .",
    "however , a strong modification of the @xmath0  yields was measured also in collisions  @xcite , where no qgp formation is expected . in particular , a stronger @xmath0  suppression relative to the j/@xmath4  was observed at central rapidity ( @xmath10 ) , while at forward-@xmath10 the two resonances followed a similar trend .",
    "this behaviour is interpreted in terms of cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects , such as nuclear parton shadowing , energy loss and @xmath11 break - up in interactions with nucleons . while the first two mechanisms are not expected to significantly depend on the charmonium state ,",
    "the @xmath11 break - up probability is sensitive to the size of the object crossing the medium .",
    "more in details , while the coloured @xmath11 pair produced by gluon fusion evolves first into a colour neutral object and eventually into a fully formed resonance  @xcite , its size grows , increasing the break - up probability .",
    "if the charmonium formation time ( @xmath12 ) is smaller than the nucleus crossing time ( @xmath13 ) , the object experiencing the nuclear medium is a fully formed resonance which can be suppressed according to its binding energy . on the contrary , if the resonance forms outside the nucleus , i.e. if a @xmath11 pair not yet evolved into a j/@xmath4  or @xmath0  crosses the medium , a similar behaviour is expected , independently of the final charmonium state . as the collision energy increases , the time spent by the @xmath11 pair inside the nucleus decreases due to its large lorentz-@xmath14 factor .",
    "the @xmath11 break - up contribution becomes negligible and a similar j/@xmath4  and @xmath0  suppression is envisaged .",
    "in contrast to these expectations , the phenix collaboration has observed a stronger @xmath0  suppression relative to the j/@xmath4  in collisions at @xmath15 gev  @xcite .",
    "alice has now addressed the study of the @xmath0  production in collisions at lhc energies to shed some light on this observation and to clarify the role of cnm effects .",
    "the alice collaboration has studied both j/@xmath4  and @xmath0  production in collisions at @xmath1 tev  @xcite .",
    "charmonium resonances are measured , through their dimuon decay channel , in the muon spectrometer , covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath16 .",
    "the two innermost layers of the inner tracking system provide the vertex identification , and two scintillator hodoscopes ( vzero ) are used for triggering purposes .",
    "a set of zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) helps to remove de - bunched collisions and to determine the event activity .",

    "the difference in the covered @xmath10 ranges reflects the shift of the centre of mass of the nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath19 ) with respect to the laboratory frame , induced by the different energies per nucleon of the colliding beams .",
    "the resonance yields are extracted by fitting the dimuon invariant mass distributions with a superposition of signals and background shapes . for the signal pseudo - gaussian or crystal ball functions , with asymmetric tails on both sides of the resonance peak ,",
    "are used , while for the background a gaussian with a mass - dependent width or polynomial @xmath20 exponential functions are adopted . the @xmath0  yield and its statistical uncertainty",

    "the charmonium suppression with respect to the corresponding yield is quantified through the nuclear modification factor @xmath27 .",

    "are also compared to theoretical calculations based on nuclear shadowing  @xcite or coherent energy loss , with or without shadowing contribution  @xcite . since the kinematic distributions of gluons producing the j/@xmath4  or the @xmath0  are rather similar and since the coherent energy loss does not depend on the final quantum numbers of the resonances , the same theoretical calculations hold for both j/@xmath4  and @xmath0 .",
    "theoretical models predict a @xmath10 dependence which is in fair agreement with the j/@xmath4  data , but in strong contradiction with the @xmath0  result , indicating that other mechanisms should be invoked to describe the @xmath0  production in .",
    "the resonance break - up cross section in the medium depends on the binding energy of the charmonium state and could be , in principle , a natural explanation for the experimental observation of the different j/@xmath4  and @xmath0  suppression , as for low energy results .",
    "however , this process can only play a role if the charmonium formation time is smaller than the time spent by the @xmath11 in the nucleus , defined as @xmath38  @xcite , where @xmath39 is the average length of nuclear matter crossed by the pair and @xmath40 is the velocity of the @xmath11 along the beam direction in the nucleus rest frame .",
    "thus , at forward-@xmath10 , the value of @xmath13 is about 10@xmath41 fm/@xmath42 , while at backward-@xmath10 the corresponding quantity is @xmath13@xmath437@xmath44 fm/@xmath42 .",
    "estimates for @xmath12 range between 0.05 and 0.15 fm/@xmath42  @xcite . under these assumptions ,",
    "no break - up effects can be expected at forward-@xmath10 , and even at backward-@xmath10 the similar @xmath13 and @xmath12 can hardly accomodate the large discrepancy observed .    and j/@xmath4  @xmath27  @xmath24  dependence compared to theoretical calculations in the forward ( left ) and backward ( right ) @xmath10 regions .",

    "theoretical calculations , that fairly describe the j/@xmath4  behaviour , overestimate the @xmath0  @xmath27  pattern . as the @xmath24  increases , the @xmath11 pair crossing time decreases and , in particular for backward production , @xmath13 varies by a factor 2 from @xmath430.07 ( at @xmath45 ) to @xmath430.03 fm/@xmath42 ( at @xmath46 gev/@xmath42 ) .",

    "finally , the @xmath0  production is studied versus the event activity , as shown in fig .",

    "the double ratio @xmath5_{\\rm ppb}/[\\sigma_{\\psi(\\rm 2s)}/\\sigma_{\\rm j/\\psi}]_{\\rm pp}$ ] and the @xmath0  and j/@xmath4  @xmath27  ( @xmath47 ) , obtained at forward and backward @xmath10 , have been studied as a function of @xmath24  ( event activity ) .",
    "both quantities indicates that the @xmath0  is significantly more suppressed than the j/@xmath4 , with a feeble @xmath24  dependence , but with a visible decrease towards large event activity classes .",
    "initial state effects alone can not account for the observed difference between the j/@xmath4  and the @xmath0  behaviour and final state effects as the break - up by interaction with cold nuclear matter seems unlikely , given the short time spent by the @xmath11 pair in the medium , in particular at forward rapidity .",
    "other final state effects as @xmath11 interaction with the final state hadronic medium created in collisions should probably be considered to explain the unexpected observation .",
