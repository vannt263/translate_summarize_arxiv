    "what is special about the scalar field responsible for our mechanism , is that it must not couple to gauge and other scalar fields which would result in an upward sloped effective potential .",
    "what remains to be shown is that , from the moment when the energy density becomes dominated by the residual fermionic energy density @xmath226 in  ( [ new potential ] ) , the universe enters a slow roll regime .",
    "we thus need to estimate the rate of change of the hubble parameter . from eq .",
    "( [ h : iterative:0 ] ) we infer , @xmath227 in the slow roll regime we have , @xmath228 .",
    "this and eq .  (",

    "the electron yukawa is sufficiently small , @xmath233 , to marginally satisfy the bound  ( [ slow roll ] ) .    from the rate of change of dark energy , @xmath234 , which is defined in eq .",
    "( [ new potential ] ) , @xmath235 we immediately infer , @xmath236^{5/2 }      \\simeq \\frac{1\\times 10^{24}~{\\rm gev}}{1+w_{\\rm de } } \\ , .",

    "the _ r.h.s . _ changes by about @xmath240 for each order of magnitude change in the scale of primordial inflation , @xmath241 . since the current observational bounds on @xmath237 , @xmath242  @xcite and @xmath243  @xcite",
    ", do not resolve @xmath237 from @xmath238 , we can not yet use  ( [ de - dot:2 ] ) to constrain the fundamental parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath1 , of the theory .",
    "next we estimate the number of e - foldings and the time before the universe reaches the singular point at @xmath2 ( flat minkowski space ) . the number of e - foldings can be estimated as ( @xmath244 ) , @xmath245 since we do not know the value of @xmath246",
    ", we can not yet calculate @xmath247 .",
    "based on the slow - roll bound  ( [ slow roll ] ) we can however estimate the minimum number of e - foldings before the universe hits the singularity at @xmath178 , @xmath248 the amount of time left before the universe reaches the singular point can be estimated as , @xmath249 with @xmath250 .",
    "hence , the singular point @xmath157 is reached only at an infinite future , which protects us from the singularity .",
    "flat minkowski space is thus the singular point of yukawa theory , which is reached only at future infinity .",
    "if that point were ever reached , strictly speaking one would loose all information about the initial state , since all universes with an initial @xmath185 converge to that point , representing a new type of information loss .",
    "figure  [ figure 3 ] is thus incorrect in the following sense .",
    "if one ever reaches the point @xmath157 , @xmath178 , any information about the initial @xmath1 would be lost , such that it makes no sense to continuously connect de sitter and anti - de sitter curves , as indicated in figure  [ figure 3 ] . for a negative @xmath1 , the evolution in anti - de sitter space is trivial , in the sense that the effective cosmological term does not change , @xmath3 .",
    "if for some reason the universe starts at the upper near - minkowski branch  ( [ ads : upper branch ] ) , @xmath251 , then it will rapidly descent to @xmath252 , as explained at the end of section  [ dynamical relaxation of the cosmological term ] .",
    "this is really an instability associated with anti - de sitter space .",
    "minkowski space is the space with @xmath253 , and it is thus fully stable .",
    "when viewed as a function of the fermion mass @xmath7 , as @xmath7 becomes smaller and smaller , the singular point @xmath157 is approached faster than exponentially , implying that at late times trajectories with different initial @xmath1 rapidly bunch up , and as time goes on it becomes more difficult to resolve the original @xmath1 of the universe .",
    "since our theory contains essentially three free parameters ( @xmath254 and @xmath7 ) , to resolve @xmath1 and @xmath44 , in addition to @xmath225 and @xmath237 , one has to measure @xmath255 , which is planned to be measured in the near future .",
    "a dynamical mechanism for relaxation of the cosmological term is presented in section  [ dynamical relaxation of the cosmological term ] by making use of the yukawa theory coupled to einstein s gravity .",
    "the mechanism is generic however and should apply to any theory , which in minkowski space exhibits an effective scalar potential with instability or runaway behavior .",
    "when the matter backreaction to einstein s gravity is taken into account , the scalar field is dynamically driven towards the attractor at @xmath2 , for any initial positive cosmological term below the planck scale , @xmath256 , and for any reasonable tree level coupling parameters . if @xmath200 , the dynamics is trivial , and @xmath257 .",
    "related work on yukawa theory does not offer an explanation for why @xmath251 today .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite we read , `` there is no particle creation in de sitter space . '' in references which discuss the coleman - weinberg - type of effective theories , it is universally claimed that the effective yukawa theories pose a problem , because of the instability of the effective scalar potential induced by the radiative effects of fermions .    an early attempt to attribute dark energy to the quantum fermionic fluctuations in expanding space - times dates a couple of years back  @xcite . the attempt failed since at that time the authors were not aware of ref .",
    "@xcite and did not properly calculate the contribution of fermionic fluctuations to the stress - energy tensor in de sitter and other expanding backgrounds .",
    "it is worth noting that in the light of our dynamical relaxation mechanism for @xmath0 , the problem of constructing quasi - stable local minima with a small but positive effective cosmological term , an example being the recent construction within the context of string theory  @xcite , loses its main motivation .",
    "the next question is whether it is reasonable to assume that the effective scalar potentials in de sitter and anti - de sitter spaces are dominated by the yukawa coupling to fermions .",
    "it is well known that coupling to scalars contributes positively to the scalar potential energy  @xcite ( in the latter reference , replace @xmath258 by @xmath259 ) .",
    "it is less known that gauge fields contribute also positively to the effective potential  @xcite , such that for the dynamical mechanism to be operative as advocated , it must be that the coupling of scalars to fermions dominates over the coupling to scalars and gauge fields at large scalar field expectation values at least for one scalar field .",
    "if the heaviest fermion of that kind has a mass , @xmath260 , and the yukawa coupling not larger than the electron yukawa , then our mechanism can explain the dark energy of the universe , which makes up about @xmath261 of the energy density of the universe , and which has a negative equation of state , @xmath262  @xcite .",
    "the history of the universe gets revised within the yukawa theory  ( [ yukawa action][yukawa lagrangian ] ) as follows .",
    "the universe begins with an initial positive cosmological term , @xmath185 , and with a scalar field vacuum expectation value close to zero .",
    "the latter can be achieved , for example , with a positive scalar mass term or quartic self - coupling .",
    "the initial cosmological term is not just of geometric origin , but it also comprises contributions of vacuum fluctuations of all matter fields . even though the precise value of @xmath1 is not important ,",
    "if we want to realise primordial inflation within our model , then @xmath263 .",
    "if the initial @xmath1 differs significantly from @xmath264 , than one or a series of phase transitions in the pre - inflationary universe can eventually generate a value suitable for primordial inflation .",
    "what is important is that the last slow roll regime of the theory corresponds to a scale , @xmath265 , since then the amplitude of cosmological perturbations will correspond to the measured value . since vacuum fluctuations of fermions in de sitter background generate the effective potential  ( [ ds : effective potential ] ) , the field rolls driven by , @xmath266 . if the potential happens to be trapped at a small value of the field by _",
    "e.g. _ a positive scalar mass term , the field eventually tunnels to a value above which @xmath266 .",
    "one gets a slow roll inflation and enough of e - foldings when the condition , @xmath267 , is met ( note that this condition is milder than the slow roll condition today  ( [ slow roll ] ) ) , such that the universe s homogeneity , isotropy , flatness , age and size problems are solved in the usual way  @xcite .",
    "our inflationary model neither suffers from the usual runaway problem , presumed to be present in inflationary models with the coleman - weinberg potentials  @xcite , nor it suffers from the naturalness problem related to the usual fine tunning of the zero potential energy at the end of inflation .",
    "after the end of inflation , the field decays , the universe reheats , and the potential energy is approximately given by  ( [ ds : potential - rho : large ] ) and  ( [ v : large m / h ] ) , where @xmath25 is now dominated by the radiation contribution , and can be viewed as a thermal ( renormalisation ) scale .",
    "the nature of the potential changes again in the matter era at a redshift , @xmath268 , when dark energy starts dominating , and the universe enters a new slow roll regime , driven by the effective potential  ( [ new potential ] ) . while our model does not really solve the coincidence problem ( why are the densities of dark energy and matter so similar today ? ) , we point out that the required fermion mass  ( [ heaviest fermion = de ] ) , whose fluctuations yield the correct amount of dark energy , is of the gut scale , which is well motivated by particle physics .",
    "if during some earlier epoch in radiation or matter era the vacuum energy starts dominating ( this may happen for example after a higgs - like phase transition , or at the time of chiral condensate formation ) , then again  ( [ new potential ] ) becomes the relevant potential , driving dynamically @xmath0 toward smaller values .",
    "this means that phase transitions mediated by scalar fields or some other condensates , which may change the vacuum energy and thus the effective cosmological term , do not anymore pose a problem , since any vacuum energy gets eventually compensated . even though it is not necessary to change the standard electroweak beh mechanism  @xcite @xcite",
    ", the higgs potential may still happen to have a nonvanishing negative mass - squared term and a positive quartic self - coupling .",
    "a positive quartic coupling is not any more required , since the potential ultimately gets stabilised through the yukawa couplings to the standard model fermions by the mechanism presented here .",
    "since in this modified mass generation mechanism the higgs mass would be of the order or smaller than the hubble parameter today , @xmath269 , the higgs particle would not be seen at the lhc or any future accelerator experiments .",
    "if the quartic self - coupling of the higgs field is chosen to be strictly zero , then there is no hierarchy problem associated with large higgs field radiative corrections ( gauge fields radiative corrections still contribute ) .",
    "furthermore , the issue of the electroweak vacuum stability  @xcite , and more generally the question whether this modified electroweak mass generation mechanism is consistent with all accelerator experiments , requires further investigation .",
    "finally , there are many possible improvements to this work : one can relax the assumption that the background space - time is ( anti-)de sitter , and work with quasi-(anti-)de sitter space and more general expanding space - times ; one can study how gradient corrections affect the results , _ etc .",
    "i wish to thank richard woodard for infinite patience when explaining to me the how - to - do s of quantum field theories in curved space - times , and for a long term collaboration , which has been the main inspiration of this work .",
    "i would like to thank my advisor robert brandenberger for introducing me to the cosmological constant problem .",
