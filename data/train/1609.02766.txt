    "on the journey towards the neutron drip - line one needs a reliable theoretical model which incorporates the known features of the nuclear many - body system and has enough predictive power for a range of unexplored nuclei .",
    "the nuclear shell model is one such , providing the basic framework for understanding the detailed structure of complex nuclei as arising from the individual motion of nucleons and the effective nuclear interactions between them . in the shell model , doubly magic nuclei ,",
    "especially those far from the line of stability , such as @xmath0sn , act as cornerstones for exploring the unknown regions .",
    "experimentally , the observation of isomers has been key to the understanding of the shell structure and the development of the shell model  @xcite .",
    "recently , nuclei around @xmath0sn have been the subject of intensive experimental studies with respect to the persistence of the @xmath15 shell gap and its relevance to the astrophysical @xmath16-process path .",
    "early @xmath17-decay results seemed to indicate a substantial shell quenching  @xcite , while isomeric spectroscopy studies gave evidence for the persistence of the @xmath15 shell down to @xmath18 , @xmath5pd  @xcite .",
    "along the @xmath19 line isomeric states were also observed in @xmath3sn  @xcite , and mixing between seniority-2 and -4 configurations was revealed for the @xmath20 isomer of @xmath21sn  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mass measurements have been crucial for experimental determination of the shell gaps @xcite .",
    "in addition , isomers in the region far from the @xmath17-stability line could serve as stepping stones towards the drip - lines .",
    "for example , the high - spin @xmath22 isomer in @xmath23co provided the first example of proton radioactivity  @xcite . similarly in the very neutron - rich region , a neutron may `` drip '' from an isomer before the neutron drip - line itself is reached , if the isomer s excitation energy takes it above the neutron separation energy  @xcite .    in this paper , shell - model calculations",
    "are performed to investigate the isomerism in the south - east quadrant of @xmath0sn , i.e. with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , including the possibility of neutron radioactivity from such isomers .",
    "the construction of an effective hamiltonian is one of the key elements in a shell - model study .",
    "the model space for the present work is @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , corresponding to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 major shells , respectively . below @xmath0sn ,",
    "the robustness of the @xmath38 shell gap has been experimentally examined and confirmed down to cd and pd  @xcite .",
    "the core excited states in @xmath8 in are found to be at nearly 4 mev  @xcite , thus this model space is suitable for the investigation of the low - lying states around or lower than 2 mev in sn , in , cd , ag , and pd isotopes with @xmath39 .",
    "so far there is no well established effective hamiltonian for this model space due to the lack of experimental data on the excited states in this most neutron - rich region around @xmath0sn .",
    "an effective hamiltonian for this model space is proposed below . in a very recent work , shell - model calculations for @xmath0 in",
    "were performed employing a modern realistic effective interaction and two - body matrix elements deduced from the @xmath40pb region @xcite .",
    "the single - particle energies for the four proton orbits and the six neutron orbits in the present model space are fitted to the reported energies of the single - particle states of @xmath8 in and @xmath41sn , respectively .",
    "these energies are from ref .",
    "@xcite and the recently discovered @xmath28 and @xmath27 single - hole states in @xmath8 in  @xcite . the single - particle energy for the @xmath35 orbit in ref .",
    "@xcite is estimated from the excitation energy of the @xmath42 state in @xmath43sb  @xcite .",
    "the present hamiltonian fixes the relative single - particle energies to the observed excited states .",
    "it is reasonable as the present work concentrates on the excitation energies of levels and neutron separation energies .",
    "the proton - proton interaction is based on the proton - proton part of jj45pna hamiltonian , which has been derived from the cd - bonn potential through the @xmath1 matrix renormalization method by hjorth - jensen and is included in the oxbash package  @xcite . the theoretical method to derive the jj45pna effective interaction and its application in the @xmath44 region",
    "is described in ref .",
    "recently , the hamiltonian jj45pna was also used to investigate the @xmath17 decay of @xmath45cd and @xmath46 in  @xcite , and the low - lying states of in isotopes around a=125  @xcite .",
    "the strength of this interaction is modified by a factor @xmath47 to reproduce the low - lying states of @xmath4cd .",
    "the neutron - neutron interaction is from the neutron - neutron part of cwg hamiltonian , which is derived from the cd - bonn renormalized @xmath1 matrix and used to study nuclei around @xmath0sn  @xcite .",
    "the proton - neutron interaction is calculated through an effective nucleon - nucleon , monopole - based universal interaction v@xmath48",
    "@xcite plus a spin - orbit force from m3y  @xcite(v@xmath48+ls ) .",
    "the validity of the v@xmath48+ls interaction in shell - model calculations has been examined in different regions of the chart of nuclei .",
    "the structure features of neutron rich c , n , o  @xcite , si , s , ar , ca  @xcite , cr , and fe isotopes  @xcite have been nicely described by shell - model calculations by taking v@xmath48+ls as the proton - neutron interaction between the @xmath49 proton shell and the @xmath50 neutron shell  @xcite , the @xmath50 proton shell and the @xmath51 neutron shell  @xcite , and the @xmath51 proton shell and the @xmath52 neutron shell  @xcite , respectively .",
    "for example , the neutron drip - lines for carbon , nitrogen and oxygen isotopes are simultaneously explained , revealing the impact of the proton - neutron interaction on the evolution of the nuclear shell  @xcite .",
    "recently , the first @xmath53 state of @xmath54s has been identified as a high-@xmath55 isomer  @xcite through the hamiltonian suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the heavier region , close to @xmath0sn ,",
    "the change of the energy difference between the @xmath42 and @xmath56 yrast levels in the @xmath57 isotones down to @xmath58pd is well explained by v@xmath48+ls  @xcite .",
    "thus it is natural and reasonable to use this interaction as the proton - neutron interaction in the present study .    in the present hamiltonian the strength of the central - force parameters of v@xmath48",
    "is enhanced @xmath59 times the original one in ref .",
    "@xcite to give a better description of the one - neutron separation energies @xmath60 .",
    "it should be noted that the original form of v@xmath48 comes from the effective hamiltonian in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 regions . in @xmath61 region ,",
    "the strength of its central part is reduced by a factor of @xmath62 to reproduce the binding energies of the b , c , n , and o isotopes .",
    "the new hamiltonian is named as @xmath63 in the following discussion as it includes 4 and 6 valence proton and neutron orbits , respectively .",
    "the present shell - model calculations are performed using the code oxbash  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the present hamiltonian operates in the particle - particle model space .",
    "the doubly magic nucleus @xmath0sn has fully occupied valence protons and no valence neutrons in the present model space .",
    "starting from @xmath0sn , the proton - hole energies of @xmath8 in and the neutron - particle energies of @xmath41sn are not directly taken as the single particle energies in the hamiltonian , but are modified by the residual proton - proton and proton - neutron interactions , respectively .",
    "the proton - hole states in the present work are affected by the missing correlations due to the removal of protons from the fully occupied @xmath64-@xmath65 shell . in the following discussion ,",
    "the configurations are written in the proton - hole neutron - particle scheme for simplicity .",
    ".[sn]one neutron separation energies of experiments @xmath66 from ref  @xcite except @xmath8cd from @xcite , predictions @xmath67 of ame2012  @xcite , calculations through the finite range liquid drop model @xmath68  @xcite and the present work @xmath69 .",

    "their semi - magic nature validates the neutron - neutron and proton - proton parts of the shell - model interactions in the present work . in some other nuclei in this region , some of the levels are possibly isomeric because of the slow transition rates resulting from low transition energies .",
    "these isomer candidates are listed in table  [ isomer ] together with those experimentally confirmed in sn isotopes and n=82 isotones .",
    "@xmath70 is the mean life - time of @xmath11 transitions obtained from the theoretical reduced transition probability @xmath2 values and predicted transition energies .",
    "the experimental @xmath71 values of @xmath3sn are from ref .",
    "the two @xmath71 values of @xmath4cd are due to the two possible decay transition energies  @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath74 isomer in @xmath7sn is analogous to the @xmath20 isomer in @xmath43sn , but its @xmath2 value is much larger than that of @xmath43sn , as shown in table .",

    "the one - body transition density of the neutron @xmath75 orbit from @xmath20 to @xmath53 in @xmath43sn is almost the same as that from @xmath74 to @xmath76 in @xmath7sn , and the @xmath2 enhancement in @xmath7sn is mainly due to the transition from @xmath77 to @xmath78 and @xmath75 to @xmath79 . although the occupancies of @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the @xmath76 state are small , the large number of @xmath77 and @xmath75 particles in the @xmath74 state result in a large one - body transition density .",
    "the transition energy between @xmath74 and @xmath76 in @xmath7sn is predicted to be almost the same as that between @xmath20 and @xmath53 in @xmath43sn .",
    "@xmath70 around @xmath80 ns is predicted for the @xmath74 isomer in @xmath7sn .",
    "the yrast @xmath12 states in @xmath10 in and @xmath4ag are predicted to be closely below the @xmath81 levels and only around @xmath82 kev above the @xmath56 ground states , as shown in fig .  [ 132 in ] for @xmath0 in , leading to long life - times . a much larger @xmath70 in @xmath0 in",
    "is predicted because of the small @xmath2 value caused by the cancellation between the proton and neutron contributions .",
    "it should be noted that due to the lack of experimental information on the proton - neutron interaction in this quadrant of @xmath0sn , large uncertainties related to the isomerism in these odd - odd nuclei are not unexpected in the present shell - model calculations .",
    "for example , the @xmath12 isomer will disappear if it is higher than the @xmath81 state . or alternatively the @xmath83 state could be isomeric , if it lies below the @xmath12 state .",
    "@xmath14 isomers are predicted in the @xmath84 isotones @xmath8cd and @xmath9pd , with @xmath70 @xmath85 ns and @xmath86 @xmath87s , respectively .",
    "the excitation energy of the predicted @xmath14 isomer in @xmath9pd is around @xmath88 mev above its neutron separation energies predicted by the present work and by moller et al .",
    "@xcite ( table  [ sn ] ) and so it may decay to the ground state of @xmath5pd by emitting a neutron with an orbital angular momentum of @xmath89 = 9@xmath90 ( not to @xmath91 state of @xmath5pd because of its @xmath92 mev excitation energy ) .",
    "the half - life of neutron emission is calculated by using the widely - used formula of the two - potential approach  @xcite , in which both the pre - exponential factor and exponential factor are explicitly defined .",
    "the potential that the emitted neutron feels is a sum of the nuclear potential , the spin - orbit potential and the centrifugl potential .",
    "the form of both the woods - saxon nuclear potential and the spin - orbit potential and the parameters used are taken from textbook  @xcite , @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 fm , @xmath96 fm , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the average mass of a nucleon .",
    "the depth of the nuclear potential @xmath100 is determined by the bohr - sommerfeld condition to ensure a quasi - bound state @xcite , @xmath101 where @xmath87 is the reduced mass of the neutron , @xmath102 is the decay energy , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are classical turning points defined by @xmath105 , and @xmath1 is the global quantum number .",
    "the predicted life - time for neutron emission from the @xmath14 state of @xmath9pd to the ground state of @xmath5pd ranges from @xmath106 to @xmath107 @xmath87s with the decay energy @xmath102 = 0.35 - 0.50 mev , comparable to that of the calculated electromagnetic decay . the global quantum number in the bohr - sommerfeld condition is fixed at 9 due to the very low decay energy .",
    "in summary , a shell - model study has been performed in the south - east of @xmath0sn to search for possible isomeric states .",
    "a new shell - model hamiltonian has been constructed for the present investigation .",
    "the proton - proton and neutron - neutron interactions , which are each limited to one major shell , have been obtained from existing cd - bonn @xmath1 matrix calculations .",
