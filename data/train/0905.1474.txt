    "are relatively weak , and in some cases , no optically thick winds occur .",
    "however , the occurrence condition of winds has not been well studied yet .",
    "@xcite mathematically examined the occurrence of optically thick winds with the kramers opacity and found that the optically thick wind occurs when the luminosity approaches the eddington luminosity and the opacity increases outward .",
    "@xcite showed that the optically thick wind occurs only in massive wds of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wd mass .",
    "wind acceleration is due to opacity enhancements at hydrogen and helium ionization zones .",
    "they also showed that a nova evolution can be well represented by a sequence consisting only of static solutions for @xmath5 , and by a sequence of wind and static solutions for @xmath6 .    in the beginning of 1990 s ,",
    "opacity tables are revised ( opal opacity : * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which show a prominent peak at @xmath7(k)@xmath8 strong enough to accelerate winds even in less massive wds of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the occurrence condition of winds has not been clarified yet , because the opal opacity has an intense peak at much higher temperature region than the helium ionization zone .",
    "therefore , we re - examine the occurrence of optically thick winds for the opal opacity .",
    "we focus on less massive wds in view of the application to slow novae or symbiotic novae in which less massive wds certainly inhabit .    in  [ sec_model ]",

    "optically thick winds blow in massive wds during the extended envelope stage ( from point b to point d through c ) .",
    "the star reaches the maximum radius at point c , where the envelope settles down into a thermal equilibrium in which nuclear energy generation is balanced with radiative loss .",
    "afterwards , the star moves leftward keeping luminosity almost constant .",
    "hydrogen nuclear burning stops at point e , and the star cools down to point a.    when the wind occurs we solve the equations of motion , mass continuity , radiative diffusion , and conservation of energy , from the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope through the photosphere assuming steady - state and spherical symmetry .",
    "this steady - state is a good approximation in the decay phase or in weak shell flashes @xcite .",
    "when the optically thick wind does not occur , we solve the equation of hydrostatic balance instead of the equation of motion . in the rising phase , we integrated energy conservation equation without energy generation term due to nuclear burning and later estimated energy generation using the temperature and density obtained @xcite . in the decay phase",
    "we set the condition that the energy generation is balanced with radiative energy loss .",
    "these equations and method of calculations are already published in @xcite .    in the rising phase , i.e. , from point a to c in figure [ hr_diagram ] , we approximate the nova evolution by a sequence of envelope solutions as follows .",
    "when the optically thick wind occurs we use static solutions from point a to b and steady - state wind solutions from point b to c in figure [ hr_diagram ] .",
    "when the wind does not occur the entire sequence consists only of static solutions .",
    "the occurrence of optically thick winds is detected by the condition described in @xcite : ( 1 ) the photospheric luminosity approaches the eddington limit and ( 2 ) at the same time the thermal energy at the photosphere is comparable to the gravitational energy .",
    "we further assume that the envelope mass does not decrease much in the rising phase , i.e. , we approximate the rising - phase by a sequence of envelope solutions with a constant mass which we define as the `` ignition mass '' , @xmath10 .",
    "this approximation may be too simple but we are interested in qualitative properties of the envelope evolution , which are hardly changed even if we assume decreasing envelope mass .    in the decay",
    "phase the envelope settles down into a thermal equilibrium , that is , the energy release due to nuclear burning is balanced to the outgoing energy flux .",
    "we approximate this stage by a sequence of optically thick wind solutions ( from point c to point d ) and static solutions ( from point d to point e ) .",
    "when the wind does not occur , the entire decay phase are approximated by a sequence only of static solutions . in this sequence ( from point c to e ) the envelope mass is decreasing from its initial value of @xmath10 at point c. time - evolution is calculated from the mass decreasing rates by nuclear burning and wind mass - loss if it occurs ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "hydrogen burning stops at point e and after that , from point e to a , the evolution is followed by a static solution with a constant envelope mass .    we have neglected effects of convection in wind solutions , because convection is ineffective in a rapidly expanding envelope @xcite .",
    "convective energy transport is calculated in static solutions using the mixing length theory with @xmath11 otherwise specified .",
    "effects of the @xmath12 parameter on our results are discussed in  [ sec_mixinglength ] .",
    "we use the opal opacity @xcite .",
    "we further assume that the chemical composition of the envelope is uniform throughout the envelope and is unchanged with time , because the convection widely develops to mix the whole envelope in the early phase of outbursts .",
    "the solar composition is assumed for the envelopes otherwise specified , which is a good approximation for weak shell flashes .",
    "@xcite showed that the composition of ejecta is close to the solar for high mass accretion rates .",
    "the above approximations may not be accurate enough to follow nova outbursts but sufficient for our purpose of qualitative study on the occurrence of winds and on the internal structures of wd envelopes .",
    "figures [ novam05 ] , [ novam10 ] , and [ novam06 ] show the quasi - evolution sequences that mimic the rising and decay phases of nova outbursts . in a case of @xmath13 wd",

    "the maximum expansion shifts toward lower temperature when we increase the ignition mass . in a case of @xmath18 ( fig . [ novam05]b ) the temperature and radius at the maximum expansion are @xmath7 ( k)@xmath19 and @xmath16 ( cm)@xmath20 , respectively , and for @xmath21 ( fig .",

    "if we further increase the ignition mass to @xmath35 , winds are suppressed and static solutions exist instead of wind solutions .",
    "this is because hydrostatic balance is established in the envelope when a substantial amount of matter above the super - eddington region , i.e. , around the opacity peak , supresses down the wind - acceleration .",
    "we define this critical mass for static expansion , as @xmath36 . if @xmath37 no winds are accelerated and the envelope expands without optically thick winds . however , this critical value is too large for the ignition mass of an accreting @xmath24 wd @xcite , so such static solutions are not realized and we do nt go into details .",
    "these two critical masses of @xmath32 and @xmath36 depend on the wd mass .",
    "for a 0.6  @xmath38 wd , we obtained @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ novam06]a shows a case of @xmath41 , in which no winds occur because the photospheric temperature does not reach the opal peak even at the maximum expansion at @xmath7 ( k)= 5.35 and @xmath16 ( cm)@xmath42 . in the case of @xmath43 ( fig .",

    "the two decay phases in figures [ novam05]a and [ novam05]b are a part of that in figure [ novam05]c .",
    "similarly the decay phases of figures [ novam10]a and [ novam10]b are identical to that of figure [ novam10]c . on the other hand , there are two different paths in the @xmath51 wd even when it is in thermal equilibrium . the decay phase of figure [ novam06]b consists of wind and static solutions , only the latter part of which is identical to that of figure [ novam06]c . the wind sequence in figure [ novam06]b and the static sequence at @xmath52 in figure [ novam06]c are different from each other all in envelope structure , in evolution time scale , and in light curve as we will see later .",
    "figure [ lledt_dm423e-5 ] shows the distribution of the diffusive luminosity and the local eddington luminosity against the temperature for solutions along the rising phase of figure [ novam06]b , i.e. , @xmath53 wd of @xmath43 . here",
    ", the local eddington luminosity is defined as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the opacity in which we use the opal opacity @xcite .",
    "since the opacity @xmath55 is a function of the temperature and density , the eddington luminosity is also a local variable .",
    "this eddington luminosity has a local minimum at @xmath44 ( k ) = 5.25 corresponding to the opacity peak as shown in figure [ lledt_dm423e-5]f .    as the star moves upward in figure [ novam06]b , the diffusive luminosity increases and approaches the eddington luminosity near the photosphere ( figures [ lledt_dm423e-5]a , b , and c ) .",
    "when the photospheric temperature decreases to @xmath44 ( k ) @xmath34 , matter is accelerated and steady mass - loss begins ( figure [ lledt_dm423e-5]d ) .",
    "after that , the envelope continuously expands to until point c in figure [ hr_diagram ] .",
    "a narrow super - eddington region appears corresponding to the opacity peak at @xmath44 ( k ) @xmath34 .",
    "the change of envelope structure is shown in figure [ internal_dm423e-5 ] .",
    "we see that the structure of the static solution just before the wind occurs is very similar to that of the adjacent wind solution .",
    "this property has been already pointed out by @xcite for the old opacity and here we confirm it for the opal opacity having a prominent peak at a much higher temperature region .    in the massive envelope of @xmath56 , however ,",
    "no winds arise when the envelope expands beyond the opacity peak of @xmath44 ( k ) @xmath34 .",
    "figures [ lledt_dm7e-5 ] and [ internal_dm7e-5 ] show internal structures in such an evolution sequence .",
    "difference from the wind sequence becomes prominent as the envelope expands ( see figs .",
    "[ lledt_dm423e-5 ] and [ internal_dm423e-5 ] ) .",
    "a remarkable difference can be observed in the density distribution .",
    "figure [ internal_dm423e-5 ] shows the monotonically decreasing density having a @xmath57 dependence in the outer envelope ( @xmath46 ( cm ) @xmath58 ) as expected from the equation of continuity @xmath59 const , where the velocity @xmath60 is almost constant in an outer part of the envelope . on the other hand , the envelope in the static sequence ( fig .",
    "[ internal_dm7e-5 ] ) develops large density - inversion at @xmath46 ( cm ) @xmath61 corresponding to a super eddington region .",
    "this density - inversion arises in order to keep hydrostatic balance in the super - eddington region ( @xmath62 ) as expected from the equation of hydrostatic balance .",
    "inefficient convections occur in the region of @xmath62 but are unable to carry all of the diffusive energy flux , thus the structure is super - adiabatic . comparing figure [ internal_dm7e-5 ] with figure [ internal_dm423e-5 ]",
    "we see a prominent core - halo structure in the density and temperature distributions in the static solutions .",
    "such differences between the wind and static sequences can be also seen in the decay phase .",
    "figure [ internal_decay ] demonstrates the difference between the two solutions in the decay phase of @xmath51 wd .",
    "both the static and wind solutions have the same photospheric temperature @xmath63 ( k ) @xmath64 but they are very different in their internal structures .",
    "the mass - losing envelope shows the density distribution of @xmath57 in the outer part while the quasi - static envelope develops a wide density - inversion region .",
    "as we have seen in the previous sections , the wind mass - loss occurs in a limited range of the envelope mass .",
    "when the ignition mass is smaller than @xmath32 the envelope expands a little and the photospheric temperature does not reach the opacity peak of @xmath44 ( k ) @xmath34 ( see figs . [ novam10]a and [ novam06]a ) . therefore , no optically thick winds occur .",
    "on the other hand , if the ignition mass is larger than @xmath36 , winds are suppressed in a way that density - inversion balances to radiation - pressure gradient in a super - adiabatic region ( see fig . [ internal_dm7e-5 ] ) . in this case",
    "the envelope expands without optically thick winds .",
    "therefore , optically thick winds occur only for @xmath65 as we have already seen in the 0.6  @xmath66 wd .",
    "figure [ lsmaxdm ] depicts these two critical masses of @xmath32 and @xmath36 for various wd masses .",
    "optically thick winds are driven in the right hand side of the thick solid line . in the lower region",
    "@xmath67 the envelope does not expand much and no optically thick winds arise . in the upper region",
    "@xmath68 ) the envelope is so massive and winds are suppressed . here ,",
    "we label the lower region `` no expansion '' , and the upper region `` expansion '' , which is an abbreviation of `` quasi - static expansion '' .",
    "as the opal opacity depends on the chemical composition of the envelope , both @xmath36 and @xmath32 depend on the composition . for a composition of typical classical novae ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 the wind",
    "is strongly accelerated and the `` wind '' region extends as shown in figure [ lsmaxdm ] . on the other hand , for population ii stars with lower metal content ,",
    "the wind is weak @xcite and the `` wind '' region becomes narrower .",
    "figure [ lsmaxdm ] also shows that @xmath36 increases with the wd mass and reaches as large as @xmath71 for @xmath72",
    "such a large ignition mass is unlikely to be realized in accreting wds .",
    "dynamical calculations have shown that the envelope mass is up to @xmath73 for a 1.0  @xmath38 wd and @xmath74 for a 1.4 @xmath75 for the accretion rate of @xmath76  yr@xmath77 and @xmath78  yr@xmath77 for cold wds @xcite .",
    "these values are practically upper limits for the envelope mass in nova outbursts but are still much smaller than @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , we regard that the `` expansion '' region and a part of the upper `` wind '' region theoretically exist but may not be realized in the actual mass - accreting @xmath79 wds .    in less massive wds such as @xmath80 ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath36 is as small as @xmath81 , which corresponds to the mass - accretion rates of @xmath82  yr@xmath77 @xcite , a typical mass accretion rate in cataclysmic variables .",
    "therefore , the `` expansion '' region becomes a subject of realistic interest .",
    "if the ignition mass is larger than @xmath36 the envelope expands in a quasi - static manner . in less massive wds of @xmath83",
    "the `` wind '' region disappears completely and the envelope evolves in a quasi - static manner .",
    "as we see in figure [ novam06 ] there are two different sequences that represent the decay phase of nova outbursts on a 0.6  @xmath66 wd .",
    "these two sequences are different from each other in its envelope mass and mass decreasing rate , so the light curves are also different .",
    "figure [ lightm06 ] shows the light curves corresponding to these sequences , both of which start from @xmath63 ( k ) @xmath84 .",
    "the light curve of the static sequence decays much slowly , because its evolution speed is determined by the mass - decreasing rate due only to hydrogen nuclear burning , whereas in the `` wind '' sequence the evolution is accelerated by the winds which carry away a large part of the envelope matter .",
    "the most remarkable difference is in the flat peak of the static sequence , whereas it decays sharply in the wind sequence .",
    "the flat peak in the static sequence reminds us a peculiar light curve of the symbiotic nova pu vul , which shows a very long plateau peak of 3000 days followed by a slow decline of 3 magnitudes/2500 days .",
    "the spectra suggest a very quiet expansion with no indication of wind mass loss during the flat peak @xcite",
    ". we may apply our static `` expansion '' sequences to such slow outbursts .",
    "detailed light curve fitting will be presented separately .    both of the wind and static expansion solutions are certainly stable because they represent nova envelope and red giant envelope , respectively",
    ". however , it is interesting to point out a possibility that a nova evolves along the static expansion sequence but it suddenly jumps in the wind sequence or vice versa during the course of evolution .",
    "if this kind of transition occurs it may proceed from a higher total enthalpy state to a lower one .",
    "the enthalpy integrated for the entire envelope is , for example , @xmath85  erg for a static envelope solution of @xmath86 with @xmath63 ( k ) @xmath87 , and @xmath88  erg for a wind mass - loss solution of a similar envelope mass and photospheric temperature .",
    "therefore , if the transition occurs it possibly goes from the static expansion sequence to the wind sequence .",
    "as the internal structure of the two solutions are very different ( see fig .",
    "[ internal_decay ] ) and the excess energy will be released , the transition may not occur in a quiet way but accompany some violent activities",
    ". it may be interesting to connect such activities to oscillatory behaviors often observed in early light curves of slow / symbiotic novae .",
    "figure [ lightm06 ] demonstrates that both of the static `` expansion '' and `` wind '' sequences exist for the same wd mass and the same chemical composition of the envelope .",
    "if the accretion rate onto the wd changes with time and , as a result , the ignition mass changes from one outburst to the next around @xmath36 , these two different types of outbursts can be realized on the same wd .",
    "in such a case outbursts behave very differently for a small change of mass - accretion rate .    in this way",
    ", we expect many active phenomena associated with static expansion sequences .",
    "more quantitative studies including light curve analysis of slow / symbiotic novae are necessary .      we have obtained @xmath32 , the lower critical mass for the envelope having optically thick winds .",
    "this critical mass is compared with hydrodynamical calculations by @xcite who presented a number of shell flashes for various parameters .",
    "the open circles with a dot in figure [ lsmaxdm ] denote their models in which mass ejection occurs , and the crosses indicate the models with no mass ejection . in these models",
    "the chemical composition of the envelope is not uniform but close to the solar value because dredge - up of wd material is insignificant for high mass - accretion rates .",
    "therefore , these models can be compared with our model labeled `` solar '' .",
    "our critical line is quite consistent with their results except the @xmath89 wd , in which their crosses are above our line .",
    "these authors defined the `` mass ejection '' by that the expansion velocity exceeds the escape velocity , which is different from our definition of occurrence condition of the winds described in  [ sec_internal ] . in our wind solutions of @xmath53",
    "the velocity does not exceeds the escape velocity as shown in figure [ internal_dm423e-5 ] . considering this difference and other difference of input parameters",
    ", we can say that our @xmath32 is quite consistent with results in @xcite .",
    "we assumed a mixing - length parameter of @xmath11 .",
    "many authors have estimated the @xmath12 parameter to be @xmath90 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) for various types of stars .",
    "the mixing - length parameter could be a function of stellar parameters or could depend on stellar structure , but these dependences are not known yet .",
    "therefore , we simply adopted @xmath11 .    in order to see the dependence of light curves on the mixing - length parameter we have calculated additional models with @xmath91 and @xmath92 as shown in figure [ lightm06 ] . for a smaller @xmath12 ,",
    "the energy transport is more efficient and the star evolves faster , resulting in a steeper light curve .",
    "even though , the static sequences still show a long - lasted flat peak and slow decline after that .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows ;    \\(1 ) for a given wd mass and chemical composition , the optically thick wind occurs when the ignition mass ( @xmath10 ) satisfies the condition , i.e. , @xmath65 . if @xmath93 the envelope does not expand and no wind is accelerated . when @xmath37 , winds are suppressed and the envelope expands with no optically thick winds .",
    "\\(2 ) optically thick winds occur smoothly from a static envelope because the structure is not drastically changed before and after the wind occurs .",
    "this property was already reported in @xcite for the old opacity but we confirm this for the opal opacity .",
    "\\(3 ) for a given wd mass and chemical composition , there exist two solutions with different structures .",
    "one is the wind solution with a monotonic decrease in the density distribution .",
    "another is the static solution that develops a wide super - adiabatic region with density inversion .",
    "\\(4 ) in massive wds ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath36 is very large and the static - expansion sequence is not practically realized ( @xmath95 ) . in the intermediate mass wds ( @xmath96 ) , both the optically thick wind and quasi - static expansion are realized depending on the ignition mass . in less massive wds ( @xmath97 )",
    "no optically thick wind occurs independently of the ignition mass .",
    "\\(5 ) the wind sequence has been applied to nova outbursts in which strong mass - loss is observed .",
