    "two methods have been used in order to estimate the anisotropies produced by the nonlinear voids of the galaxy distribution in _",
    "open universes_. one of these methods is based on the so - called _ swiss - cheese _ model ( rees & sciama 1968 ) . the original version of this model applies to the case of overdensities surrounded by underdensities , but suitable modifications lead to a model for underdensities surrounded by overdensities ( thompson & vishniac 1987 ) .",
    "estimates of the anisotropies produced by swiss - cheese voids were obtained by thompson & vishniac ( 1987 ) , and martnez - gonzlez & sanz ( 1990 ) .",
    "the main elements of these spherical voids are : an absolute vacuum in the void core , a uniform overdense shell compensating the vacuum , and a general friedmann - robertson - walker background outside this shell ; hence , the density profile of the resulting structure is very particular , while the background is general and the compensation is exact .",
    "the second method is based on the tolman - bondi solution ( tbs ) of the einstein equations ( tolman 1934 ; bondi 1947 ) .",
    "a general assymptotic friedmann - robertson - walker background and a general spherically symmetric energy density profile are compatible with this solution ; such a general profile can be used in order to model both a partial vacuum in the void core and a sharped wall .",
    "two different codes based on the tbs were built up by panek ( 1992 ) and arnau et al .",
    "panek s code was used ( panek 1992 ) to estimate the anisotropy produced by voids with small compensating walls , while the code due to arnau et al .",
    "was used ( arnau et al . 1993 ) in the case of voids without walls ; here , the void walls are modeled in some detail taking into account some observational data .    in _ flat universes",
    "_ , another powerful method is being used in order to estimate the anisotropy produced by nonlinear cosmological structures .",
    "this method does not require any symmetry , it is based on the potential approximation developed by martnez - gonzlez , sanz & silk ( 1990 ) , which applies beyond the linear regime . in the flat case ,",
    "the method was applied by anninos et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , martnez - gonzlez , sanz & silk ( 1992 , 1994 ) , tuluie & laguna ( 1995 ) and quilis , ibez & sez ( 1995 ) ; these authors used various complementary techniques and conditions ( n - body simulations , high resolution shock capturing methods and particular spectra and statistics ) .",
    "recently , arnau , fullana & sez ( 1994 ) proved that some great attractor - like structures evolving in open universes ( @xmath6 ) and placed at redshifts between @xmath7 and @xmath8 produce anisotropies of the order of @xmath9 on angular scales of a few degrees .",
    "these structures had a density contrast of the order of 1 when they influenced the microwave photons ; hence , the resulting nonlinear gravitational anisotropies are produced in the mildly nonlinear regime .",
    "the following question arises : are there void - like objects suitable structures , locations and backgrounds producing significant anisotropies as in the case of the great attractor - like objects studied by arnau , fullana & sez ( 1994 ) ? .",
    "in the case of nonlinear structures ( density contrasts @xmath10 ) evolving in open universes , the tbs and the swiss - cheese model can be used in order to answer this question .",
    "the use of the tbs seems to be preferable because this solution involves appropriate density profiles .    in order to model void - like objects",
    ", some observational data must be taken into account . in the eighties",
    ", there has been a great deal of observations on the spatial distribution of galaxies ; in these observations , some voids with walls have been detected ( kirshner et al .",
    "1981 , davis et al . 1982 ,",
    "vettolani et al .",
    "1985 , de lapparent , geller & huchra 1986 , rood 1988 , dey , strauss & huchra 1990 ) ; among them , the botes void ( bv ) seems to be the greatest one .",
    "this void was first described by kirshner et al .",
    "( 1981 ) . from the data given by these authors and those due to",
    "de lapparent , geller & huchra ( 1986 ) it follows that the void in botes is a big quasispherical region with a defect of galaxies ; its centre is located at @xmath11 150 @xmath12 from the local group and its radius is @xmath11 30 @xmath12 .",
    "this region only contains the @xmath13 of the galaxies expected in the same volume of the background ; hence , the energy density contrast of galaxies inside the void is @xmath0 .",
    "surrounding this region , there is an irregular shell having an excess of galaxies , in other words , there is an inhomogeneous sharped wall . although the observations are not very accurate ( kirshner et al . 1981 ,",
    "de lapparent , geller & huchra 1986 ) , current data suggest that the amplitude of the density contrast of galaxies inside the wall is @xmath14 and the mean width of this wall is @xmath15 .",
    "the above observational data must be complemented with appropriate assumptions about the dark matter distribution .",
    "since the nonlinear anisotropy produced by voids located far from the last scattering surface is a gravitational effect , this anisotropy is produced by the total energy density contrast @xmath16 .",
    "this contrast can be obtained from the observational value of the density contrast produced by galaxies @xmath17 and the value of the the so - called _ linear bias parameter b_. this parameter is defined by the relation @xmath18 . in this paper , it is assumed that luminous galaxies trace the mass distribution .",
    "this means that the parameter @xmath19 is assumed to be unity and , consequently , the relative defects ( excesses ) of galaxies and dark matter are identical inside the void ( wall ) .",
    "the case @xmath20 has not either theoretical or observational support , it corresponds to a void ( wall ) with an amount of dark matter smaller ( greater ) than that of the case @xmath21 ; by this reason , the anisotropy of the case @xmath20 is expected to be greater than that estimated in the case @xmath21 .",
    "similar arguments lead to the conclusion that , in the case @xmath22 , the anisotropies are smaller than those of the case @xmath23 . since the condition @xmath21 is used along the paper , we can state that our computations give upper limits to the anisotropy produced by botes - like objects , except in the unlikely case @xmath20 .    in this paper ,",
    "the wall is described by two parameters , the amplitude , @xmath24 , of the total density contrast inside the wall and the distance , @xmath25 , between the two points of the wall in which @xmath16 is the @xmath26 of @xmath24 ; the distance @xmath25 is called the wall width . in the case",
    "@xmath23 , current data suggest that the value of @xmath24 is @xmath14 and the wall width @xmath25 is @xmath15",
    ". it can be easily verified ( see section 2 ) that a wall having these features overcompensates the central underdensity described above .",
    "the mass excess of this wall is about two times the mass defect of the underdense region .",
    "this is not a model dependent conclusion , but a direct consequence of the observations . in this task ,",
    "the anisotropy produced by an isolated structure is estimated .",
    "the chosen overcompensated structure is formed by a void and all the matter surrounding it . according to the above observational evidences , overcompensated structures of this kind are present in the universe . as required by the cosmological principle ,",
    "each of these structures should be compensated by other structures in large volumes containing various voids . in order to imagine this compensation",
    ", it is useful to take into account that the energy excess surrounding a certain underdensity is shared by the neighboring ones and , consequently , this excess also contributes to the compensation of other neighboring underdensities ; in other words , only a part of this excess must compensate the central underdensity .",
    "the anisotropy produced by a realistic distribution of irregular voids and walls can not be calculated from the anisotropy produced by an isolated void with walls ; nevertheless , if the chosen isolated structure produces large enough anisotropies and its spatial distribution is appropriate , the true distribution of voids could produce relevant effects ; in this case , the information obtained from the study of isolated structures strongly motivates further researches based on suitable approaches .",
    "since the effects of isolated voids with walls placed far from the last scattering surface are expected to be small , the greatest observed void , namely , the bv has been selected .",
    "several bv realizations evolving in various backgrounds have been considered in order to do an exhaustive study of the anisotropies produced by isolated voids .",
    "observational evidences are taken into account in order to select these realizations and backgrounds .",
    "henceforth , @xmath27 is the scale factor , @xmath28 is the cosmological time , an overdot stands for a derivative with respect to @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the ratio @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the density parameter .",
    "the subscripts @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 indicate that a quantity has been valued at decoupling , at present time and in the background , respectively ; for instance , @xmath35 is the hubble constant .",
    "if @xmath35 is given in units of @xmath36 , the parameter @xmath37 is the reduced dimensionless hubble constant .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : several bv models compatible with current observations are defined in section 2 .",
    "the initial conditions at decoupling leading to these models are derived in section 3 .",
    "the anisotropies produced by the bv models of section 2 are presented in section 4 ; appropriate comparisons with previous computations are also given in this section . finally , the main conclusions are summarized and discussed in section 5 .",
    "a bv realization is defined by the present density contrast inside the void @xmath38 , the present radius of the underdense region @xmath39 , the present amplitude of the density contrast inside the wall @xmath24 and the present wall width @xmath25 .",
    "any present configuration of the void in botes is a bv realization .",
    "each bv realization is the final state of an evolutionary process , which takes place in a certain friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "hereafter , a bv realization and a background define a bv model .",
    "any model describes the time evolution of the void in a certain background .",
    "this evolution leads to a present state ( a realization ) . if the cosmological constant vanishes , @xmath40 and @xmath31 are the free parameters of the background .",
    "the numerical codes need a fixed value of @xmath40 ; nevertheless , if the distances are given in units of @xmath12 , the final results do not depend on the chosen value of @xmath40 ; so , only the background parameter @xmath31 is a physically significant free parameter to be varied .",
    "six bv realizations have been selected to be considered in the next sections .",
    "one of the chosen bv realizations corresponds to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this realization is only studied in the case @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting model is considered with the essential aim of testing our codes and comparing our results with previous ones ( panek 1992 )    the remaining five bv realizations are obtained as follows :    the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fixed ; their values are assumed to be @xmath0 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the amplitude @xmath24 is varied from 2 to 6 , and the wall width @xmath25 is varied from @xmath47 to @xmath48 . taking into account that the values of these parameters suggested by the observations ( de lapparent , geller & huchra 1986 ) are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we proceed as follows : in a first step ,",
    "the wall width @xmath51 is fixed and the amplitudes @xmath7 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are considered and , in a second step , the amplitude @xmath54 is fixed and the wall widths are assumed to be @xmath47 , @xmath55 and @xmath48 . note that the realization @xmath49 and @xmath50 is considered in each of the above steps .",
    "hereafter , any of these five realizations is identified by the values of the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "each of these realizations has been studied in several cases corresponding to @xmath31 values ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 ; nevertheless , for the sake of briefness , only some appropriate models corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath45 are presented .    for each bv realization",
    ", the wall compensates the central underdensity at a certain distance from the void centre .",
    "this distance is called the compensation radius , @xmath58 .",
    "tables 1 and 2 ( seventh column ) show these radius for all the models considered in this paper . in the cases of the first and fourth rows of table 1 and the second row of table 2 ,",
    "the compensation occurs outside the wall , while in the remaining cases , it occurs inside the wall ; for example , in the case @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the compensation radius is @xmath59 and , consequently , the compensation of the central underdensity takes place near the wall centre ; this means that about one - half of the wall compensates the central void , while the remaining of the wall must compensate other underdensities .    for a given @xmath31 value ,",
    "the quantities defining any bv realization ( present contrasts and distances ) must be numerically obtained after evolution from appropriated initial conditions ; the choice of the initial conditions corresponding to a given model ( a bv realization evolving in a defined background ) is now discussed .",
    "the main goal of this task is the estimation of the secondary gravitational anisotropies produced by big voids located far from the last scattering surface .",
    "since the evolution of the microwave photons must be studied from the last scattering surface to our position in the universe , the initial conditions for the void evolution are set at decoupling time ( redshift @xmath60 ) .",
    "the initial profiles of the total energy density and the peculiar velocity field fix the two arbitrary functions involved in the tbs ( see arnau et al .",
    "1993 ) ; hence , these initial profiles fix the time evolution of the resulting void from decoupling to present time .    in this paper , the initial density profile is assumed to be    @xmath61 \\ , \\ ] ]     + where @xmath62 is a radial coordinate and the conditions @xmath63 are satisfied .",
    "the initial peculiar velocity is @xmath64 + where the angular brackets denote a mean value from @xmath65 to @xmath62 .    since the cosmological constant vanishes , the background parameters involved in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be written in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath40 .",
    "only the choice of the profile ( 1 ) is arbitrary . the profile ( 2 )",
    "is obtained from eq .",
    "it corresponds to vanishing nongrowing modes ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the form of the initial density profile ( 1 ) has not any theoretical justification .",
    "this form only gives a certain parametrization of the initial conditions , this parametrization is expected to be suitable in order to describe voids with walls as a result of two facts : ( 1 ) for small values of @xmath66 , the quantities @xmath67 and @xmath68 become very small and @xmath69 becomes quasiconstant ; this means that the profile ( 1 ) describes a central underdensity with a density contrast @xmath70 and , ( 2 ) the central underdensity is initially surrounded by an overdensity , which is the origin of the present void wall .",
    "it has been verified that the exponent @xmath53 is suitable in order to get the required amplitudes and wall widths at present time , but other exponents could be also tested .",
    "a realization is defined by the quantities @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the question is : which are the values of the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 leading to a given realization in a fixed background ? .    for each @xmath31 value , a numerical code based on the tbs plus eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) calculates the quantities @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 from initial values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; this means that the quantities defining a bv realization are not initial conditions for the numerical code , but quantities derived from it .    given a bv model ,",
    "the corresponding initial conditions are obtained as follows : arbitrary values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are assumed and the resulting values of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are compared with those of the chosen model ; if they are different , the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are varied and the results are compared again .",
    "these calculations and comparisons are carried out by a numerical code based on the `` gradient method '' ( as in sez , arnau & fullana 1993 ) .",
    "this code modifies the initial values of the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 in such a way that the new parameters lead to a bv model better than the previous one .",
    "this code repeats the modification of the parameters until the resulting bv model is similar enough to the required one .",
    "this process requires nonlinear techniques because the final bv model is a nonlinear one ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; in other words , nonlinear methods are necessary as a result of our bv normalization , which is based on present nonlinear observational data .",
    "table 1 gives the initial values of the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for each of the @xmath75 models studied in this paper .",
    "table 2 gives the same information for the @xmath76 models .",
    "the present @xmath16 profiles corresponding to our bv models are shown in fig .",
    "1 . for a given realization , the present energy density profiles of the models @xmath2 and @xmath45 are indistinguishable because the same values of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 have been chosen in both cases ( see tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "it is well known that the tbs only applies before shell crossing .",
    "hellaby and lake ( 1985 ) gave the necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of shell crossing ; these conditions are satisfied in the cases studied in this paper ; hence , the shell crossing is unavoidable .",
    "the time at which this phenomenon takes place is not given by the hellaby and lake conditions ; this time must be determined in each particular case . in the cases studied in this paper",
    ", it has been verified that the shell crossing does not take place before present time ; hence , the tbs can be used in our computations .",
    "the initial conditions discussed in sect .",
    "3 define the space - time structure and , consequently , these conditions fix the differential equations of the photon trajectories .",
    "these differential equations must be integrated in order to estimate the anisotropy produced by a bv model ; this integration is carried out by using the code due to arnau et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and sez , arnau & fullana ( 1993 ) plus the initial profiles ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .    the centre of the bv open models ( @xmath2 ) has been located at a significant set of distances from the observer , which correspond to redshifts between 0.052 ( @xmath77 ) and 100 ( @xmath78 ) ; nevertheless , only the results corresponding to a few appropriate distances are displayed in the figures .",
    "the centre of the bv flat model corresponding to the first row of table 2 has been placed at the same redshifts , while the model used for comparisons with previous computations ( second row of table 2 ) has been only located at @xmath79 in order to facilitate these comparisons ; hence , all the selected structures are located far from the last scattering surface and , consequently , they produce negligible temperature fluctuations and doppler shifts on this surface ; in which , the temperature is assumed to be constant .",
    "our code ( arnau et al . 1993 , sez , arnau & fullana 1993 ) numerically computes the temperature t of the microwave background as a function of the observation angle @xmath80 ; this is the angle formed by the line of sight and the line joining the observer and the inhomogeneity centre .",
    "the function @xmath81 is then used to calculate the mean temperature @xmath82 and the total temperature contrast @xmath83 \\ / \\",
    "< t>$ ] . in the expansion of @xmath84 in spherical harmonics , @xmath85 , @xmath32 and @xmath86 are the total dipole and quadrupole , respectively .",
    "the dipole @xmath32 is assumed to be a doppler effect appearing as a result of the present peculiar velocity of the observer produced by the botes - like object ; in other words , any gravitational contribution to the dipole is neglected ; thus the relativistic doppler quadrupole is @xmath87 .",
    "the total doppler effect ( dipole and quadrupole ) produced by the peculiar motion of the observer is subtracted from @xmath88 to obtain the residual anisotropy @xmath89 ; therefore , on account of the large distance separating the chosen voids from the last scattering surface , this anisotropy is a pure gravitational effect .",
    "the rigorous computation of this effect requires nonlinear techniques when the amplitude of the density contrast reaches values greater than @xmath90 in some region of the structure .",

    "all the cases of the left panels of fig .",
    "2 correspond to the same backgrounds and locations and the central underdense regions have the same structure ; hence , the differences between the anisotropies of two of these cases are due to the wall .",

    "3 ) is @xmath112 in the case @xmath100 .",
    "the modulus of this amplitude decreases as @xmath104 increases from @xmath100 to @xmath105 and it is an slowly increasing function of z for @xmath106 ; hence , at redshifts between @xmath57 and @xmath113 , the value of this modulus is much smaller than the amplitude of the residual anisotropy corresponding to the open case ( top panel of fig .",

    "our code based on the gradient method plus eqs ( 1 ) and ( 2) gives the initial conditions leading to any bv model .    as a result of the fact that the void walls have been modeled taking into account the observational evidences , the compensation of the central underdensity takes place at scales larger than that of a single void .",
    "various voids contribute to this compensation .",
    "the anisotropy produced by a botes - like void strongly depends on the wall structure , the density parameter and the location of the symmetry centre .",
    "according to previous estimates , which are confirmed in this paper , the anisotropy produced by compensated voids evolving in a flat universe has an amplitude of a few times @xmath125 ; however , for @xmath2 and locations between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the overcompensated voids suggested by the observations produce anisotropies of a few times @xmath3 on scales of a few degrees .",
    "a question is relevant : what is the effect produced by a distribution of voids in an open universe ? .",
    "in the flat case @xmath45 , the anisotropies corresponding to the same range of redshifts are much smaller .",
    "the value of the density parameter is of crucial importance . in the case of overcompensating walls ,",
    "the sign of the effect towards the central region of the void is positive ( negative ) for open ( flat ) universes .",
    "if this effect is detected in future in the case of a single observable structure , results could be used in order to constraint the density parameter ; nevertheless , it should be pointed out that such a detection is not easy , in particular , in the flat case , where the resulting anisotropy is very small .    for the above interval of redshifts @xmath128 and @xmath2 , the present distances from the void centre to the observer range from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "there are many voids located between these distances ; nevertheless , only some rare voids would be botes - like voids ( or greater ) producing anisotropies of a few times @xmath3 . given two observation angles @xmath131 and @xmath132 , the number of big voids @xmath133 and @xmath134 crossed by the photons traveling along the chosen directions can be different . for",
    "@xmath135 , the relative temperature difference corresponding to @xmath131 and @xmath132 would be near @xmath9 . this possibility can not be rejected _",
    "a priori_. it must be either rejected or accepted after quantitative calculations .",
    "the feasibility of the condition @xmath135 depends on the abundance of big voids .",
    "since the anisotropy on scales of a few degrees observed in experiments as cobe ( smoot et al . 1992 ) and tenerife ( watson et al 1992 ) is near @xmath9 , the contribution of big voids at low redshifts could be important .",
    "in the flat case , this contribution is expected to be too small . in any case , it would appear superimposed to the primary anisotropy produced near the last scattering surface in the linear regime .",
    "similar results were obtained in the case of great attractor - like objects ( arnau , fullana & sez 1994 ) . for @xmath6 and @xmath136 ,",
    "these structures produce anisotropies of the order of @xmath9 on scales of a few degrees . in both cases , either the universe is open enough or the anisotropy is negligible .",
    "results about great attractor - like object enhance the interest of the above question , which should be rewritten as follows : what is the anisotropy produced by a distribution of voids and great overdensities in an open universe ? .",
    "although a model of overcompensated isolated voids based on the tbs is currently competitive , it has some important limitations related to the spherical symmetry .",
    "even if the central underdense region is quasispherical , the true wall is not regular and the motion of the matter contained in this part of the structure is not strictly radial . there are clusters and structures in the walls , which produce local peculiar motions tangent to the wall .",
    "these motions would also produce anisotropy ( tuluie & laguna 1995 ) .",
    "the anisotropy produced by the substructures of the walls are expected to be important on angular scales smaller than a few degrees and , consequently , the estimates of this paper should be admissible .",
