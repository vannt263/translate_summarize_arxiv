    "the @xmath0 scuti pulsators occupy a region in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) where many physical processes occur .",
    "for instance , it is in the classical instability strip where the transition between deep and efficient to shallow convective envelopes takes place . the so called granulation boundary ( gray & nagel 1989 ) was found from bisector measurements to cross following spectral types : f0v , f2.5iv , f5iii , f8ii , g1ib , which intersects the @xmath0 sct instability strip . because convection has an impact not only on pulsational stability but also on stellar evolution , activity , stellar atmospheres , transport of angular momentum , etc . , it is of great interest to understand how this transition takes place .",
    "@xmath0 sct stars are pulsating stars with masses between 1.5 and 2.5 m@xmath4 , effective temperatures ranging from 6700 to 8000 k and are situated on the pre main sequence ( pms ) , main sequence ( ms ) and on the immediate post ms .",
    "the periods of pulsation range from 15 minutes to 8 hours and are the result of low radial order pressure and gravity modes , driven by the @xmath9 mechanism acting like a heat engine , converting thermal into mechanical energy ( e.g. eddington 1919 , cox 1963 ) . while a star is contracting , pressure and temperature increase . as a consequence",
    "the opacity ( @xmath9 ) will increase in certain layers which can block the radiative flux from below .",
    "when the star returns to its state of equilibrium ( due to the pressure and temperature increase ) the additional stored thermal energy will be transformed into mechanical energy and the stellar layers will shoot past the equilibrium . while the star is expanding the temperature and pressure decrease and",
    "so does the opacity , the latter is because the ionized gas is more transparent .",
    "the star will stop expanding and contracts , the ions will recombine and @xmath9 increases again and the cycle repeats .",
    "the specified layers where the thermal energy is stored , are the zones connected to ( partial ) ionization of abundant elements which can take place only at specific temperatures .",
    "the zone where neutral hydrogen ( h ) and helium ( he ) are ionized has about 14 000 k and is close to the surface .",
    "the second ionization zone of he ii is at @xmath1050 000 k and drives the pulsation in @xmath0 sct stars .",
    "the location in the hrd is confined within a region defined by the so called red ( cool ) and blue ( hot ) edges , respectively .",
    "stars with effective temperatures higher than the blue edge do not pulsate because the he ii opacity bump is at a depth where the density is too low to excite pulsation ( pamyatnykh 2000 ) .",
    "near the cool border of the instability strip , the oscillations are damped due to the increasing depth of the convective outer layers .",
    "this border of the instability strip was theoretically calculated by dupret et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , using time dependent convection , which requires a non - adiabatic treatment that considers the interaction between pulsation and convection as described by grigahcne et al .",
    "interestingly , the instability domain of the @xmath11 doradus ( @xmath11 dor ) stars , pulsating in high radial order g modes , overlaps that of the @xmath0 sct stars , suggesting that both types of pulsation should be excited simultaneously in stars in the overlap region ( handler 1999 ) .",
    "satellite missions like most , corot and _ kepler _ have established that the @xmath0 sct and @xmath11 dor hybrids are a common phenomenon , rather than an exception ( grigahcne et al .",
    "2010 , uytterhoeven et al . 2011 ) .    in earlier days",
    ", models of @xmath0 sct stars predicted many more frequencies to be excited than were observed .",
    "extensive ground - based observing campaigns showed that lowering the detection level is imperative to finding additional independent modes ( e.g. , breger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "nowadays , thanks to asteroseismic space missions , in some cases `` too many '' frequencies are observed .",
    "for instance , poretti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) needed around 1000 frequencies to fit the corot light curve of the @xmath0 sct star hd 50844 .",
    "mode identification based on spectroscopic data suggested that modes with high spherical degree ( @xmath12=14 ) are excited .",
    "several radial orders of high spherical degree modes split by rotation would be required to explain the large number of observed frequencies . a second corot star ( hd 174936 , garca hernndez et al .",
    "2009 ) was found to have approximately 500 significant frequencies attributed to pulsation .",
    "kallinger & matthews ( 2010 ) suggested that the major part of the observed frequencies originates from granulation noise and is not due to pulsation .",
    "their interpretation assumes the presence of non - white granulation noise , as observed in sun - like stars and red giants .",
    "the granulation time scales found in the two corot stars are consistent with scaling relations from cooler stars .",
    "the granulation hypothesis is strongly supported by earlier spectroscopic measurements , where line profile variations were found to be caused by convective motions in the atmosphere of a and am stars ( landstreet et al .",
    "in general , a type stars have rather high microturbulent velocities which is further evidence for granulation ( montalban et al .",
    "balona ( 2011 ) confirmed that in the _ kepler _ a type stars ( whether variable or not ) there is a correlation between the noise level and the effective temperature as expected for the signature of convection .",
    "however , it is plausible that we observe a combination of both high order @xmath12 modes and granulation noise .",
    "the data quality from space is indeed high enough to also observe higher @xmath12 modes , as already shown by balona & dziembowski ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors calculated that the amplitudes should drop below 50 @xmath8mag for modes with @xmath13 due to geometrical effects , assuming the same intrinsic amplitude of @xmath14 for all modes .",
    "this is a value which can be detected from space .",
    "even given the present possibilities to detect large numbers of pulsational mode frequencies , unique seismic modelling of @xmath0 sct stars is still hampered by many obstacles . the major difficulty concerns the identification of the pulsation modes .",
    "it is not yet known why some of the modes observed in @xmath0 sct stars are excited to observable amplitudes while others are not .",
    "to clearly determine the geometry of a mode , long observing campaigns , multicolour photometry and/or high - resolution time - resolved spectroscopy are needed .",
    "houdek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and samadi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) predicted that the convection in outer layers of @xmath0 sct stars is still efficient enough to excite solar - like oscillations . using time - dependent , nonlocal ,",
    "mixing - length convective treatment , they calculated the intrinsic stability of modes excited by the @xmath9 mechanism .",
    "only when modes are intrinsically stable acoustic noise generated by turbulent convection can excite the natural eigenmodes in a given frequency range .",
    "contrary to the modes excited by the @xmath9 mechanism , the amplitudes of stochastically excited oscillations can be approximated by theoretical and empirical scaling relations as they are determined by the interaction between excitation and damping .",
    "convection excites _ all _ the modes in a certain frequency regime , again in absolute contrast to the @xmath9 mechanism , allowing mode identification from pattern recognition .",
    "this is possible because consecutive high radial order p modes are approximately equally spaced in frequency , which gives rise to a comb - like structure in periodograms .",
    "the large frequency separation @xmath15 is the mean separation between high radial order modes of the same degree @xmath12 and measures the mean density of the star .",
    "the stochastic oscillation spectrum is described by a broad envelope with a maximum at the frequency of maximum power @xmath16 , which is related to the acoustic cut - off frequency . a very tight scaling relation relation between these two parameters",
    ", @xmath15 and @xmath16 allows to derive basic stellar parameters , such as radius and mass ( cf . kjeldsen & bedding , 1995 , stello et al .",
    "2009 , huber et al . 2011 ) .    all these tight relations ,",
    "even if not perfect in some cases , allow to perform seismology of solar - like stars with high accuracy .",
    "the derived mass distribution of the _ kepler _ population of sun - like stars may have a large impact on the models predicting the population of our galaxy ( chaplin et al .",
    "can the same be done for @xmath0 sct stars ? are there relations we can use to study these stars as a group ?",
    "if so , uytterhoeven et al . (",
    "2011 ) and balona ( 2011 ) who statistically analyzed all the a and f stars in the _ kepler _ fov , at least did not find any .",
    "recently , antoci et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reported the first evidence for solar - like oscillations in the @xmath0 sct star hd 187547 observed by the _",
    "kepler _ spacecraft , but in no other member of the same type .",
    "new observations , however suggest that the situation is more complicated than anticipated .",
    "it is true that all sun - like stars observed with sufficient accuracy show solar - like oscillations but should all the @xmath0 scuti stars behave alike ?",
    "sun - like stars are , compared to more massive stars like the @xmath0 sct stars , more homogeneous when it comes to rotation for example .",
    "the stars located in the @xmath0 sct instability strip have rotational velocities from very slow ( 44 tau has a projected rotational velocity , v sin i = 2 @xmath3 1 kms@xmath6 , zima et al .",
    "2009 ) to almost break - up velocity ( altair , e.g. monnier et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the case of altair",
    "the authors find a difference in temperature between the pole and the equator of more than 1500k ( ! ) .",
    "fast rotation , for example , ( also common in @xmath0 sct stars , e.g. solano & fernley ( 1997 ) ) combined with differential rotation is suggested to influence the depth of the convective outer layers such that solar - like oscillations might be excited in stars in which otherwise the convection would not be effective enough ( macgregor et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand , theoretical modelling of the stars fg vir ( daszyska - daszkiewicz et al . 2005 ) and 44 tau ( lenz et al . 2010 ) suggests insignificant convection in their envelopes .",
    "this emphasizes the _ inhomogeneity _ of @xmath0 sct stars which may cast some doubts on whether _ all _ stars with a given temperature and luminosity should show solar - like oscillations .",
    "carrier et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have searched for solar - like oscillations in the spectroscopic binary am star hd 209625 ( which is not classified as a @xmath0 sct star ) , but did not detect any .    the main motivation for the present work were the theoretical predictions that solar - like oscillations should be present in @xmath0 sct stars ( houdek et al .",
    "1999 , samadi et al .",
    "if detected , that would allow us to perform mode identification for the stochastically excited oscillations from pattern recognition and therefore to also identify the modes of pulsation excited by the @xmath9 mechanism . as a result we would be able to model the deep interior of the star by using the @xmath0 sct oscillations and constrain the overshooting parameter @xmath17 , which is the primary factor to influence the main sequence lifetimes of stars with convective cores . the solar - like oscillations on the other hand are most sensitive to the outer ( convective ) envelope , which so far is poorly understood in stars with masses typical of @xmath0 sct stars . to search for solar - like oscillations in @xmath0 sct stars",
    ", we chose in this case to use radial velocity ( rv ) measurements .",
    "the reason is that the noise due to granulation is lower in rv measurements than in photometry , in the solar case between 10 and 30 times lower , depending on the frequency ( e.g. , see fig .",

    "( 1996 ) , was initially used to detect doppler shifts caused by planets orbiting their host stars .",
    "it is based on the idea that the stellar light and the reference frame should follow the same path through the telescope and the spectrograph , minimizing temporal and spatial error sources on the radial velocity measurements .",
    "the cell is mounted in front of the spectrograph .",
    "the reason for choosing @xmath32 is that it shows a forest of absorption lines between 5000 and 6000 , a region where stars with a spectral type later than a have many spectral lines providing the necessary information for precise radial velocity measurements .",
    "the wavelengths of the @xmath32 absorption lines are very well determined by scanning the cell with a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) .    for the search of signals with tiny amplitudes of the order of few meters per second a complex reduction method , involving the modelling of the instrumental point - spread - function ( psf ) of the spectrograph",

    "the shape of the instrumental profile is influenced by many sources , such as seeing changes during the night , optical elements , dust , etc .",
    "a change of only 1% in the psf shape , which is normally approximated by a gaussian , can introduce shifts in the radial velocity measurements of several ms@xmath6 ( butler et al .",

    "@xmath41 , the transmission function of the spectrum of the iodine cell is the fts spectrum obtained as described above .",
    "the intrinsic stellar spectrum @xmath34 must resemble the spectrum free of any instrumental effects , which is done by deconvolution of the target spectrum ( not observed through the iodine cell ) and the psf .",
    "for the latter , a rapidly rotating ob type star is observed through the iodine cell , mimicking a calibration lamp .",
    "it can be assumed that the stellar spectral features are smeared out , and the iodine spectrum is imaged . from that , the psf of the instrument can be derived .",
    "this procedure is more accurate than measuring a real calibration lamp , because the calibration star light follows the same path as that of the target star .",
    "the psf itself is a sum of several gaussians at fixed position and widths but with variable height . in this way a possible non - symmetric psf can be described . for a detailed explanation on how to derive a psf see valenti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . to preserve the detailed wavelength information provided by the @xmath32 cell , the stellar spectra",
    "are oversampled by a certain factor ( at least 4 times ) to which also the @xmath32 cell is resampled .",
    "now having the deconvolved intrinsic stellar spectrum @xmath34 , the psf of the instrument and the iodine cell spectrum , the observations can be modelled as described in equation [ iobs ] . for this final step",
    "the doppler shift @xmath42 becomes an additional free parameter , the one of interest which allows to reproduce the observations .",
    "figure 1 by butler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) nicely illustrates the procedure described above .    the _ stellar observations network group _ ( song , grundahl et al .",
    "2011 ) is an ongoing project which aims to establish a global network of eight robotic 1-m telescopes equipped with high - resolution spectrographs . to obtain ultra - precise radial velocity measurements",
    "the iodine cell method was chosen . during the planning phase of the song project a code ( isong ) to extract precise radial velocity measurements of a star observed through an iodine cell was developed by fg and is based on the method described above ( butler et al .",
    ". a direct comparison ( grundahl et al . 2008 ) using the same data set of @xmath24 cen a observed with uves@vlt , demonstrates that isong is capable of reaching nearly the same precision as mentioned by butler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . to analyse the data for the present work we used isong .      to obtain the instrumental profile of ucles , we observed the rapidly rotating early b type star hd  64740 , whereas for the mcdonald spectrograph we observed the rapidly rotating b type star hd  67797 .",
    "the psf of each spectral chunk was calculated by first approximating the instrumental profile by a single gaussian with a fixed position but a variable height and width ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the latter values were then used as an initial guess for the multiple gaussian . for ucles and the mcdonald spectrographs",
    "we find a mean psf of 3.2 and 2.4 pixel widths respectively .",
    "these values are significantly lower than the size of the chunks which were chosen to be 71 pixels in both cases .    even if the b type stars used to derive the instrumental psf had very few absorption lines , some were still present .",
    "the chunks covering those wavelengths regions could not be used . in some other cases we obtained unusual - looking gaussians as well , but with no obvious reason . to avoid losing these chunks ( @xmath44 ) , we replaced them by the mean psf computed from the reliable chunks .      in the case of isong",
    "the deconvolution is done by using the procedure described by crilly et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . to model the intrinsic stellar spectrum a very high s / n spectrum of the target star , not taken through the iodine cell , is needed . to this end ,",
    "usually many stellar templates without iodine lines are combined . in the case of the aat data",
    "we only had few and all were from different pulsation phases .",
    "as there are equivalent width ( eqw ) variations due to the high amplitude of pulsation of the dominant @xmath0  scuti - type pulsation ( @xmath10 10 kms@xmath6 peak - to - peak amplitude ) , it turned out that not combining our template spectra resulted in less scattered rv measurements .",
    "to have consistent data sets , the same was done for the mcdonald measurements .",
    "finally we chose the spectra with a phase closest to the _ minimum change _ in eqw .",
    "butler et al .",
    "( 1993 ) observed a cepheid which has very large changes in eqw during a pulsation cycle using the same technique .",
    "they chose to use more templates , each observed in a specific phase of pulsation .",
    "in the case of @xmath1 puppis however , the average difference in rv when using templates observed at different phases of pulsations is minimal , of the order of @xmath45 ms@xmath6 per spectrum .",
    "both , the aat and mcdonald template spectra have a s / n of 200 and higher .      to derive the rv we used the instrumental profile , the intrinsic stellar spectrum and the information provided by the iodine absorption lines as described above .",
    "as an initial guess we used the rv obtained by cross - correlating one order without @xmath46 absorption lines of each of the science spectra with the same wavelength region of the template .    because the dominant mode is radial , during a pulsation cycle the lines are periodically blueshifted and redshifted .",
    "this means that a given spectral line is captured on a different pixel .",
    "if the chunk would be fixed at the same position on the ccd the spectral lines would move in and out and the actual rv measurement would always reflect different parts of the spectrum . in the case of @xmath1 puppis",
    ", we first determined the pixel shift induced by the pulsation for every measurement using the cross - correlated rv .",
    "this information was then used to shift each chunk such that it measures the same wavelength region regardless of the pulsation phase .",
    "experiments have shown that the scatter decreased when deriving the rv using this sliding window technique . in fig .",
    "[ pixelshift ] we show the shift in pixels relative to the first spectrum for the aat and mcdonald data respectively .",
    "another parameter that influences the results is the oversampling factor .",
    "it is usually set to 4 or higher ( butler et al . 1996 ) and determines by how much the stellar spectra are oversampled with respect to the spectral resolution , to make use of the wavelength information provided by the @xmath46 cell .",
    "the latter is also resampled to the same scale .",
    "increasing this factor also increases the computing time significantly , and can last up to hours for only one science frame . in the case of aat data , for example , with a total number of 1165 spectra the computations would take several weeks for an oversampling factor of 16 or higher ! tests with different oversampling factors , 4 , 8 and 16 , have shown that 8 is the best in keeping the balance between a satisfactory quality and acceptable duration of computing time , which was also chosen for all further data analyses .",
    "once the modelling was finished , each spectrum delivered 21 orders @xmath47 36 chunks = 756 `` independent '' rv measurements in the case of the aat data , whereas each mcdonald science spectrum consisted of 13 orders @xmath47 22 chunks = 286 rvs . excluding the outliers and combining the remaining values to their mean",
    "should then result in a very precise rv measurement .",
    "unfortunately , identifying the outliers in an objective way is not straightforward .",
    "more importantly , we also tried to separate the factors which mostly influence the measurement precision : rv information originates from stellar absorption lines that are not uniformly distributed across the spectrum .",
    "the wavelength region that can be used is restricted to approximately @xmath48   when using the @xmath46 technique .",
    "there are several chunks which do not show any stellar lines and therefore are not expected to carry any useful rv information . also the density of the @xmath46 lines is getting lower when approaching the wavelength limits given above . the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ zzzz217wlrv ] shows the eqw of a given spectrum as a function of wavelength as well as a linear trend , clearly illustrating that the number of lines decreases with increasing wavelength .",
    "this is consistent with what is expected for a and f type stars .",
    "nevertheless it should be kept in mind that at higher wavelength also telluric lines start to appear in the spectrum , in other words a high eqw does not necessarily mean a stellar line .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ zzzz217wlrv ] , where the rv measurements of each chunk of a given spectrum are plotted as a function of the eqw of the chunk .",
    "there is a clear trend showing that chunks having a higher eqw cluster around a rv value of 2000 ms@xmath6 , but we can also see outliers .",
    "the goodness of the fit is expressed by the rms value and represents the residuals between the observations and the model in percent . in principle , the lower the value the better the model fits the observations .",
    "we used the measurements with a cutoff at a sigma fit value of @xmath49 , only few outliers can be found above .",
    "chunks with an eqw larger than @xmath50 also tend to have a larger sigma .",
    "as already mentioned a large eqw does not necessarily mean a stellar line , but can be attributed to telluric lines or to a mixture of both .",
    "the errors per measurement ( i.e. per spectrum ) were estimated by calculating the rms scatter . to obtain the lowest error and to find out which parameter has the largest impact on the quality of the measurements , experiments varying three different parameters restricting the number of chunks used , were undertaken .",
    "the errors per measurement were then calculated for each spectrum using the rv information from the selected chunks depending on eqw , wavelength range , rms value . to decide which parameter constellation delivered the best data set , a `` lowest mean error '' was introduced , by averaging the errors per measurement for the entire data set ( for aat 1165 errors ) . the lowest mean error ( 14.5 ms@xmath6 ) was found when all the chunks with wavelengths between 5000 and 5900 , eqw @xmath51 0.2 and with sigma fit value @xmath52 0.1 were used .",
    "the minimum eqw seems to have the largest impact on the errors , which is not surprising because chunks with very low eqw values carry little or no rv information .",
    "even if there were systematic effects which might have been introduced by the lack of absorption lines or by strong telluric lines in some chunks or by any other effect , we concluded that the amplitude of the dominant mode intrinsically varies from chunk to chunk , i.e. from line to line .",
    "amplitude variability ( from chunk to chunk ) is also present in the mcdonald data and the espadons measurements , the latter data set was not observed through an iodine cell and therefore was not reduced using isong .",
    "further support for amplitude variability comes also from literature : yang et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and mathias et al .",
    "an example of several rv curves derived from different chunks for the aat as well as for the mcdonald data can be found in fig .",

    "the amplitudes differ up to 2000 ms@xmath6 from peak to peak amplitude which translates to approximately 20% of the pulsation amplitude .",
    "such large differences in amplitude preclude a possible detection of the predicted solar - like oscillations with expected amplitudes between 1 - 2 ms@xmath6 if averaging over all chunks , even after careful selection .",
    "in the end it turned out that an additional visual inspection of all the `` best '' rv curves , selected using the method described above , ( aat and mcdonald data ) was the best method to determine which chunks to keep for further analyses .",

    "this is very different in the case of signals with small amplitudes , originating from , e.g. , solar - like oscillations or planetary companions , where a statistical approach is the only possible method to quantify the quality of the data set .",
    "after the barycentric correction was done , the dominant frequencies derived photometrically ( see section 3 ) where prewhitened ( the amplitudes and phases were free parameters ) from each of the rv curves independently and only then the residuals where combined allowing to increase the precision significantly ( see section on analyses for details ) .",
    "the radial velocities measured with espadons were extracted using bisectors , which are usually used to study line asymmetries .",
    "the latter can be caused by different mechanisms such as pulsation , stellar rotation , magnetic fields , mass loss , granulation , etc .",
    "a bisector is constructed by connecting the blue and the red line component of an absorption line at the same height and taking its middle point .",
    "if the line is symmetric a vertical straight line will be the result , whereas non - symmetric lines will cause different shapes depending on the velocity fields occurring in the photosphere of a star .",
    "this method has been extensively used to , e.g. , study convective motions in cool stars ( see e.g. gray 2005 ) as well as to map the photospheres of roap stars ( e.g. elkin et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this can be done because the core of an absorption line is formed in higher photospheric layers relative to its wings .",
    "the shape , the span of velocity as well as the absolute position in wavelength of a bisector display important depth information ( see , e.g. , gray 2009 ) .",
    "it is out of scope of the present paper to disentangle the velocity fields originating from pulsation from those caused by granulation .",
    "this means that we were not necessarily restricted to unblended lines , which are normally used when line asymmetries are studied , but could also use lines blended by the same element with the same contribution to the line as we only want to determine the rv .",
    "this procedure might influence the amplitude of non - radial modes , but for radial modes it should be safe because the line will periodically blue and red shift with the pulsation period . for line identification we used the synthetic spectra computed for the abundance analyses of @xmath53 puppis as described by antoci , nesvacil & handler ( 2008 ) .",
    "the code to derive the line bisectors was kindly provided by luca fossati and was written in idl .",
    "after analysing several lines we found a strong rv amplitude dependence on relative fluxes . as the data were reduced using the _ libre esprit _ pipeline available for the espadons instrument , which has been tested extensively , it is very unlikely that we are dealing with artefacts .",
    "the normalisation of the spectrum has a very high impact on the bisector , because it can introduce or cancel asymmetries in the spectral line .",
    "however , our results should not be affected by this because , firstly , we do not use the part of the bisector close to the continuum ( see fig .",
    "[ bis ] ) . secondly , to explore this problem",

    "in fact mathias et al .",
    "( 1997 ) already reported amplitude variability as function of line depth for the ca ii @xmath20  6122    line .",

    "figure [ bis ] illustrates several bisectors at different phases of the dominant mode of pulsation ( 7.09823 cd@xmath6 ) .",

    "these can be excluded to originate from non - radial modes , as the amplitude of the strongest non - radial mode is expected to be below 200 ms@xmath6 , i.e. , less than one - tenth of the measured effect .",
    "a likely scenario is that we observe the running wave character of the dominant mode as described in mathias et al .",
    "( 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "however to confirm this interpretation more detailed analyses are needed which are not the scope of this present paper .",

    "a new interferometric measurement of @xmath1 puppis yielded an angular diameter of 1.68 @xmath3 0.03  mas , which translates into a radius of 3.52 @xmath115  r@xmath4 .",
    "the dominant mode of pulsation is the radial fundamental mode , which allows us to directly determine the expected large frequency separation @xmath116 . using the @xmath116-@xmath16 scaling relation we predict the solar - like oscillation to have a maximum amplitude at @xmath117  cd@xmath6 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "given the noise level of 0.4 ms@xmath6 we can exclude the presence of significant peaks higher than 1.2  ms@xmath6 using the significance criterion of s / n=3.05 introduced by carrier et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . finally , following kjeldsen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we exclude the presence of solar like oscillations with a peak - amplitude per radial mode of 0.5 ms@xmath6 .",
    "recently , antoci et al . (",
    "2011 ) reported the first evidence for the presence of solar - like oscillations in the @xmath0 sct am star hd 187547 .",
    "their interpretation was supported by the striking similarities between the observed signal and the properties of solar - like oscillations .",
    "new observations of this star , however make the picture somehow more complicated , as additional data from the _ kepler _ spacecraft indicate that the mode lifetimes of the modes interpreted as being stochastically excited are longer than duration of the data sets .",
    "this is not consistent with stochastically excited modes as observed in sun - like stars .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 puppis and hundreds other _ kepler _ @xmath0 sct stars do not show solar - like oscillations may lead to the conclusion that the theory predicting this type of pulsation is still incomplete , especially because all solar - like stars observed long enough show stochastic oscillations .",
    "the question , however , is if this is also to be expected for the @xmath0 sct stars , mainly because these stars are certainly not as homogeneous as solar - type stars , e.g. when it comes to the distribution of rotational velocities , e.g. 44 tau , zima et al . ( 2009 ) and altair , e.g. monnier et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in the case of hd 187547",
    ", there is a smooth transition between the @xmath0 sct modes and the modes interpreted as solar - like oscillations , as predicted from the @xmath116-@xmath16 scaling relations , suggesting similar time scales and therefore an interaction that might also explain the observed mode lifetimes .",
    "this is not predicted to be observed in @xmath1 puppis .",
    "so far there is no theoretical work to investigate to which extent and how the @xmath9 mechanism may influence the acoustic oscillations driven by the turbulent motion of convection , but the fact that even in the sun the @xmath9 mechanism plays a role ( balmforth 1992 ) , even if minor , shows the necessity to consider this .",
    "maybe solar - like oscillations are only excited in @xmath0 sct stars where the two regions overlap , because the convection might not be effective enough to excite these pulsations alone but gets additional power from the @xmath9 mechanism which acts at similar time scales . at the moment",
    "this hypothesis is purely speculative but needs to be tested , both from theoretical point of view but also observationally .    for results of our photometric campaign and modelling of the @xmath0  scuti pulsations of @xmath1 puppis we refer to antoci et al .",
