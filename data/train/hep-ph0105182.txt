    "for a very large volume second generation neutrino detector with superb angular resolution and large statistics for atmospheric neutrinos of order @xmath60 events per year for icecube , this background can be reduced , in fact , essentially eliminated .",
    "because the atmopheric neutrino background will be known with high precision , the number of events in the angular bin of the sun can be determined by interpolation from adjacent bins .",
    "it should be possible to estimate the rate of atmospheric neutrinos to the level of a few events , and to achieve a background much smaller than the fluctuations on the events in the bin .",

    "the prospects for searching msugra parameter space are less optimistic than in the mssm .",
    "if non - universal boundary conditions are considered , the prospects of detecting sugra neutralino dark matter with such detectors are increased .",

    "4 .   for large values of large @xmath151 the neutralino annihilation cross section and the indirect detection rate",

    ", a higher muon energy threshold will be advantageous if @xmath268 gev .",
    "6 .   for the icecube and the antares experiments , the large number of background events will make background subtraction possible with only a small remaining irreducible background @xcite and allow measurement of the neutralino annihilation signal .",
    "susy neutralino dark matter with a mass larger than about 200 gev offers great promise for indirect detection experiments .",
