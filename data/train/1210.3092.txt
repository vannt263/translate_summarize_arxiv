    "we view `` persistence theory '' as the computer science friendly application of morse theory to data analysis .    * _ data _ considered in this thesis is called pcd ( point cloud data ) which is , mathematically , a _ finite metric space _ @xmath2 of very large cardinality .",
    "a pcd often appears as a collection of points in some euclidean space @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the euclidean distance .",
    "it is hard to visualize a pcd or to study its structure directly , since the cardinality is large and dimension of the euclidean space in which it embeds can be more than three",
    ". however , we can understand qualitative features of a pcd by analyzing the family of simplicial complexes associated to it . in this thesis",
    "we use vietoris - rips complexes which were introduced first by vietoris then by rips in connection with the group theory ( vietoris @xcite , hausmann @xcite ) .",
    "* morse theory @xcite is part of geometric and algebraic topology , whose purpose is to describe the topology of reasonably nice spaces @xmath5 , for example smooth manifolds , with the help of a generic real valued functions @xmath6 , for example proper smooth functions with all critical points nondegenerate .",
    "it uses the local changes in the homology of the sub - levels @xmath7)$ ] to describe the global topology ( homology ) of the space @xmath5 .",
    "the topology of the sub - levels for such generic functions changes for a discrete collection of @xmath8 s , called critical values .",
    "if @xmath5 is compact then the topology changes for a finite collection of @xmath8 s , say @xmath9 and a finite filtration @xmath10 is obtained .    persistence theory , as considered by h. edelsbrunner",
    ", d. letscher , a. zomorodian @xcite , p. frosini and c. landi @xcite , also anticipated in rene deheuvels @xcite , provides a slight change of perspective .",
    "the object to start with is a space @xmath5 equipped with a finite filtration rather than a function @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to the concepts of _ persistence vector spaces _ , and then to _ linear algebra of persistence vector spaces _ , and to additional type of invariants , _ bar codes _",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "( as recognized by carlsson and zamorodian @xcite the concept of bar codes corresponds to `` torsion and rank '' of a finitely generated graded module over the ring of polynomials of one variable .",
    "this concept was not previously used in the work of computer scientists . )",
    "when the underlying space @xmath5 is a simplicial or more general polytopal complex , algorithms of reasonably low complexity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as proposed in @xcite , @xcite can be used to calculate efficiently the _ bar codes _ of the persistence vector space associated with a filtration of the complex . from the bar codes",
    ", one can derive the homology of the sub - levels and then of the underlying space .",
    "_ relationship with data analysis _",
    "the persistence theory becomes relevant to data analysis due to remarkable new ideas :    one can understand the qualitative features of a pcd by analyzing geometric shapes , in this case simplicial complexes , associated to it .",
    "one associates to the finite metric space @xmath12 and @xmath13 a simplicial complex @xmath14 ( so called `` vietoris - rips complex '' ) . since a single vietoris - rips complex @xmath14 does not contain enough information of @xmath12 , one considers all of these complexes for all @xmath13 .",
    "fortunately only finitely many of them are different and they form a finite filtration of the standard simplex of dimension the cardinality of @xmath15 less one unit . the result of this analysis is encoded in bar codes , which carry information about the qualitative features of the data and signal the missing parts and `` accidental noises '' in the data .",
    "this theory had already nice applications in many areas of science cf .",
    "carlsson @xcite and one expects much more to follow .",
    ".2 in    section [ sec 2 ] , mathematical preliminaries , provides a concise presentation of the mathematical concepts behind the persistence theory . in section [ sec 2 ]",
    "we recall the definitions of simplicial complexes , simplicial homology , polytopal complexes , cellular homology , singular homology and betti numbers as well as the methods to calculate them when the coefficient field is @xmath0 or @xmath1 .    when the field is @xmath0 , the calculation is done by the _ elz algorithm _ ( h. edelsbrunner , d. letscher , and a. zomorodian ) @xcite .",
    "when the field is @xmath1 , the calculation can be done by the _",
    "hodge decomposition_. this is a new method , at least as long as the calculation of bar codes is concerned , based on the elementary hodge theory @xcite .",
    ".2 in    in section [ sec 3 ] , persistent homology of a pcd , one reviews the basic algebra of ( tame ) persistence vector spaces and introduces the _ bar codes _ of a tame persistence vector space .",
    "these are by now standard concepts but our presentation is slightly different from the existing literatures .    from a point cloud data ( pcd ) , @xmath2 , one derives a filtration of simplicial complexes ( vietoris - rips complexes mentioned before ) @xmath16    then @xmath17-dimensional homology groups with coefficients in a fixed field of the spaces of this filtration with the linear maps induced by inclusions define a tame persistence vector space . the `` _ _ bar codes _ _ '' of this tame persistence vector space are referred to as the bar codes of the pcd . for the definition of bar code see subsection [ secpla ] .",
    "when the coefficient field of homology groups is @xmath0 , the calculation of bar codes is done by the elz algorithm .",
    "when the coefficient field of homology groups is @xmath1 , the calculation of bar codes is done by a slight generalization of the hodge decomposition as described in section [ sec 2 ] .",
    "_ this is a new contribution . _",
    "the _ simultaneous persistence _ used in section [ sec 4 ] in relation with _ level persistence _ _ is also a new contribution _ , and requires appropriate modifications / improvements of the elz algorithm .",
    ".2 in    in section [ sec 4 ] , persistence theory refined , one considers continuous maps @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath18 is weakly tame ( definition [ weakly tame ] ) , a finite filtration @xmath19 is defined , where @xmath20)$ ] and @xmath21 are critical values .",
    "the homology groups in each dimension of the above filtration provide a persistence vector space whose bar codes are referred to as the bar codes of the ( weakly tame ) map @xmath18 in that dimension . in section [ sec 4 ] the `` persistence '' for such filtration ( which is the standard persistence considered in section [ sec 3 ] ) is referred to as the _ sub - level persistence _ and its invariants as the _ bar codes for the sub - level persistence _ of @xmath18 .",
    "the sub - level persistence analyzes the changes in the homology of sub - levels .    in section [ sec 4 ]",
    "we refine the sub - level persistence to _ level persistence_. the level persistence considers the changes in the homology of the level sets @xmath22 rather than the changes in the homology of the sub - level sets @xmath7)$ ] . in a more primitive form",
    "the level persistence was first considered in @xcite under the name `` interval persistence '' . for tame maps ( definition [ tamemap ] )",
    "the level persistence is equivalent to zigzag persistence previously introduced in @xcite .    in this work",
    "the maps considered will be tame , i.e. the topology of the levels changes at finitely many @xmath8 .",
    "the theory requires the tameness hypotheses , however almost all continuous maps and in particular all maps of practical interest like simplicial maps or generic smooth maps on smooth manifolds are tame .",
    "tame maps are weakly tame ( corollary [ tametoweaklytame ] ) .",
    "the level persistence determines and is determined by the _",
    "relevant persistence numbers _ introduced in section [ sec 4 ] . for a tame map the relevant persistence numbers are equivalent to the bar codes for the zigzag persistence , a concept introduced by carlsson and silva @xcite .",
    "we call these bar codes _ bar codes for level persistence _ and also provide their definition from a slightly different perspective .    for a tame map",
    "the relevant level persistence numbers consist of a finite collection of numbers while the bar codes for level persistence ( equivalently for zigzag persistence ) consist of a finite collection of intervals of four types : closed , open , left open right closed and left closed right open . for a tame map",
    "@xmath23 they carry considerably more information than the bar codes for sub - level persistence of the map @xmath18 .",
    "in fact the former implies the latter as explained and illustrated by examples in section [ sec 4 ] .",
    "there are two fundamental concepts in the level persistence : _ death _ and _ detectability _ ( or _ observability _ ) .",
    "these concepts should be compared with _ birth",
    "_ and _ death _ in sub - level persistence , however are not quite the same .",
    "we also introduce in section [ sec 4 ] the concept of positive and negative bar codes since they are related to relevant persistence numbers and can be calculated efficiently when the underlying space of the map is a simplicial complex and the map is linear on each simplex .",
    "we reduce the calculation of bar codes for level persistence or of relevant persistence numbers to the calculation of bar codes for sub - level persistence .",
    "however the sub - level persistence is not for the map @xmath18 but for other maps associated with @xmath18 .",
    "these associate maps are derived via the construction of _ cuts along levels_. for this purpose we provide new algorithms to calculate `` cuts along levels '' , of interest to computational geometry , and improve on the existing algorithms ( e.g elz ) .",
    "section [ sec 4 ] also contains a number of examples and pictures to describe the implementation of the algorithms .    the level persistence as presented in this thesis was also considered in papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is the ph.d thesis written under the direction of d. burghelea at osu .",

    "<S> persistence theory discussed in this paper is an application of algebraic topology ( morse theory ) to data analysis , precisely to qualitative understanding of point cloud data . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically a point cloud data is a finite metric space of a very large cardinality . </S>",
    "<S> it can be geometrized as a filtration of simplicial complexes and the homology changes of these complexes provide qualitative information about the data . </S>",
    "<S> there are new invariants which permit to describe the changes in homology ( with coefficients in a fixed field ) and these invariants are the `` bar codes '' .    in section [ sec 3 ] </S>",
    "<S> we develop additional methods for the calculation of bar codes and their refinements . when the coefficient field is @xmath0 , the calculation of bar codes is done by elz algorithm ( named after h. edelsbrunner , d. letscher , and a. zomorodian ) . when the coefficient field is @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an algorithm based on the hodge decomposition .    </S>",
    "<S> the original persistence theory involves the `` sub - level sets '' of a nice continuous map ( tame map ) . </S>",
    "<S> with dan burghelea and tamal dey we developed a persistence theory which involves level sets discussed in section 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a refinement of the original persistence . </S>",
    "<S> the level persistence we propose is an alternative to zigzag persistence considered by g. carlsson and v. d. silva . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce and discuss new computable invariants , the `` relevant level persistence numbers '' and the `` positive and negative bar codes '' , and explain how they are related to the known ones .    </S>",
    "<S> we provide enhancements and modifications of elz algorithm to calculate such invariants and illustrate them by examples .    </S>",
    "<S> sections 3 is preceded by background materials ( section [ sec 2 ] ) where the concepts of algebraic topology used in this paper are defined . </S>"
