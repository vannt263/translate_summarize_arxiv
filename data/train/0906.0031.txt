    "the kohlrausch ( stretched exponential ) function has been largely employed to describe luminescence decays of different materials and in different time scales ( see @xcite , and references therein ) , and it has the following form :    @xmath0 \\text { , }   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    with @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the value of parameter @xmath2 in the range @xmath1 makes @xmath3 decays slower than the exponential function , whereas for @xmath4 the function ( [ eq1 ] ) is called compressed exponential and it has short - tails , consequently , it decays faster than the exponential function .    for the general consideration of the study of luminescence decay @xmath3",
    ", it is usually considered the distribution of rate constants @xmath5 berberan1 connected with @xmath3 by the laplace transform given by@xmath6with @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , @xmath5 must be nonnegative for all @xmath8 in order to be considered as a distribution function .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath9 is normalized , i.e. , @xmath10d@xmath11 .",
    "we note that @xmath12 may have a large change for a small change in @xmath3 . in this way",
    ", the precision of the experimental data will be important for the choice of the distribution of rate constants @xmath5 .",
    "modification and generalization of the stretched exponential function as a decay function has been recently considered , for instance , a decay function unifying the modified stretched exponential and becquerel decay laws berberan1,berberan2,berberan3 .    in this work",
    "we consider a simple distribution of rate constants @xmath5 based on the tsallis distribution @xcite .",
    "our idea of employing this distribution is due to its simplicity and it has been applied to a variety of natural systems ( see , for instance , plastino1,plastino2,lyra , beck ) .",
    "we shall show that the luminescence decay function generated by the tsallis distribution can be useful to describe experimental data .",
    "to do so we shall fit the data of porous silicon at low temperature @xcite and the simulation result of the trapping controlled luminescence model described in @xcite with our luminescence decay function .",
    "for the luminescence decay @xmath3 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the distribution @xmath9 can be expressed in an integral representation @xcite as follows :    @xmath13 \\cos \\left [ u^{\\beta } \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\beta \\pi } { 2}\\right ) -k\\tau _ { 0}u\\right ] \\ . \\label{eq4}\\ ] ]    we see that this last expression is quite complicated .",
    "now we consider the tsallis distribution for @xmath5 , and it is given by    @xmath14 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q } }   \\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is a normalization factor .",

    "1 . all the curves decay monotonically with time , and two of the curves of @xmath27 have fat tails .",
    "we note that the lowest curve of @xmath27 in the figure is very close to the curve of @xmath30 ; this means that any experimental data fitted with these curves must have a good level of precision in order to choose which one of the curves is preferable .    for application of our result",
    "we consider the experimental data of porous silicon at low temperature given in @xcite . in fig .",
    "2 we compare the best fit of the data by using the stretched exponential and @xmath27 . we see that both curves can fit the data ( which are not shown in our figure ) very well . then , in this case , the experimental data do not offer us sufficient precision to discard one of the curves .",
    "we note that the behavior of @xmath27 is not the same of  @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath28 describes a straight line , whereas @xmath27 does not .",
    "another application of our result is to consider the model of trapping controlled luminescence given in ref .",
    "the process during the excitation is described by the following equations :    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the instantaneous concentrations of electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band , respectively ; @xmath37 is the retrapping coefficient , @xmath38 is the recombination coefficient and @xmath39 is the trapping coefficient of free holes during the excitation ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the concentrations of the traps and recombination centers , whereas @xmath42 and @xmath43 are their respective instantaneous occupancies .",
