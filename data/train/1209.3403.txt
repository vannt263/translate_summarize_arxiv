    "if quantum cosmology is ever to be part of empirical science , it must be described by a good effective theory .",
    "there is no hope of exactly solving its equations in realistic models or to tame conceptual quantum issues made even more severe in the context of cosmology .",
    "the derivation of testable predictions requires systematic approximations at semiclassical order and beyond , and by experience with other areas of physics , effective actions or equations are the best available tools .",
    "while the speculative part of quantum cosmology , addressing for instance the planck regime or the status of multiverses , requires all subtleties of quantum physics to be considered  such as choices of hilbert spaces , self - adjointness properties of hamiltonians or unitarity of evolution , an understanding of deep conceptual issues and the measurement problem  physics can and must proceed without all these problems being solved .",
    "compare this situation for instance with quantum field theory , for which no rigorous interacting and non - integrable version is known . and",
    "yet , at the effective level it is the key tool behind the success of elementary particle physics . given the immensity of the planck scale , potentially observable effects in quantum cosmology are realized at low energies where semiclassical quantum gravity , with the first few orders in @xmath0 taken into account , suffices .",
    "this feature makes effective theory in quantum gravity and cosmology even more powerful than in other settings @xcite .",
    "as we will see in the course of this review , somewhat surprisingly , even conceptual problems of quantum gravity can advantageously be addressed with effective methods , especially with an extension to effective constraints .",
    "given the amount of research on effective theories and their applications , one may think that deriving an effective theory of quantum cosmology is a simple and well - understood problem . however , this is not at all the case .",
    "quite general and powerful techniques of effective actions or potentials do exist , employed with great success in particle physics and condensed - matter physics alike .",
    "quantum cosmology , on the other hand , is unique by virtue of several features .",
    "it requires aspects of effective equations not encountered in other fields , related for instance to the prevalence of canonical methods , the generally covariant setting lacking evolution by a unique time parameter , or the absence or inapplicability of non - perturbative ground states or other distinguished classes of states .",
    "these technical problems will be discussed in due course . for now , as a motivation of our detailed look into effective theory , we state the following two general problems by which quantum cosmology differs from other fields .",
    "first , quantum cosmology is much like condensed - matter physics , with microscopic quantum degrees of freedom manifesting themselves on length scales far larger than their own .",
    "while the precise nature of microscopic degrees of freedom ( strings , loops ,  ) remains unclear and disputed among the different approaches , their presence in some form is widely agreed upon . by considering large structures or space - time regions",
    "made from many building blocks , quantum cosmology differs significantly from most situations encountered in elementary - particle physics , where events with a comparatively small number of particles in excited states close to the vacuum are studied .",
    "quantum cosmology is a many - body problem , a situation in which it is difficult to derive and justify valid effective descriptions .",
    "the effective view has been put to good use in condensed - matter physics , but only thanks to rich and merciless experimental input to weed out wrong ideas and stimulate new successful ones .",
    "quantum cosmology is not ( yet ? ) subject to experimental pressure , and many ( good and bad ) ideas are sprouting .",
    "effective cosmological theory must be able to stand on its own , requiring a systematic and rigorous formulation taking into account all features and consistency conditions to be imposed in quantum gravity .    as the second problem , we observe that the theoretical foundation of quantum cosmology is much weaker than that of condensed - matter physics to which it is otherwise quite close .",
    "we know well which hamiltonian we should use to find all states and energies of excitations in a crystal , but mathematically the problem is challenging and calls for the approximations of effective theory . in quantum cosmology , we do nt even know which precise hamiltonian or other underlying object to use for the dynamics of a universe .",
    "even if we choose one particular approach to quantum gravity , its mathematical objects or its specializations to cosmology are incompletely known or understood , opening wide the door for ambiguities and spurious constructions .",
    "we need a well - understood theory to pinpoint places where best to look for observational effects , and we need observations to guide our theoretical constructions .",
    "quantum cosmology , with an incompletely understood theory and no current observations , is a slippery subject , depriving us of a good handle to grasp its implications . in the absence of experiments ,",
    "we can only rely on conceptual arguments and internal mathematical consistency conditions which , however , come along with their own problems .",
    "in this situation , effective techniques have proven to be one of the few reliable approaches for physical evaluations of the theory , allowing one to include all crucial quantum effects in equations with clear physical meaning , and to take into account ambiguities by sufficiently general parameterizations .",
    "this general framework and its current status in the context of quantum cosmology are the topics of this review .",
    "one source of technical and conceptual problems in quantum cosmology and quantum gravity in general is that the theory deals with relativistic space - time , in the absence of a unique hamiltonian to generate evolution in time .",
    "instead , many choices for time and corresponding hamiltonians or evolution equations are possible , and they must all lead to the same physics . while this invariance is guaranteed classically , it implies a complicated problem after quantization , presenting the strongest set of consistency conditions to restrict possible choices of quantum cosmologies .",
    "unfortunately , these issues are often set aside in research on quantum cosmology and even quantum gravity , owing to their complicated nature .",
    "this intentional oversight implies a large number of ambiguities , fixed in those contexts only by ad - hoc constructions . to keep this review focused",
    ", we will not discuss the rather large body of works in such directions , for instance those crucially using the distinction of a time variable by gauge - fixing or deparameterization in canonical settings , and only mention shortcomings in contexts in which they become apparent .",
    "generally speaking , results derived with a distinguished choice of time ( or gauge ) can not be considered physically reliable unless one can make sure that they do not depend on one s choice of time .    in this section",
    ", we will discuss the main features that an effective theory of quantum cosmology must deal with , which includes covariance and state properties .",
    "the former ensures independence of choices of time , the latter deals with additional freedom in quantum theories . by these considerations , we will be guided toward suitable ingredients for the mathematical formulation of effective theory .",
    "effective equations of quantum cosmology are supposed to modify some cosmological version of einstein s equation by quantum corrections . in most cases ,",
    "such a cosmological version is a reduction to isotropic friedmann ",
    "lematre  robertson ",
    "walker space - times or homogeneous bianchi models ( minisuperspaces ) , a restriction to some specific form of inhomogeneous degrees of freedom such as lematre ",
    "tolman  bondi or gowdy geometries ( midisuperspaces ) , or an inclusion of unrestricted but perturbative inhomogeneity around a background in the former classes of models .      in homogeneous models , the dynamics",
    "is completely determined by one equation for gravitational degrees of freedom ( such as the friedmann equation ) and one for matter ( such as the continuity equation ) .",
    "the friedmann equation of isotropic models , @xmath1 depends only on first - order derivatives and is therefore a constraint , to be satisfied by initial values of second - order equations of motion . when interpreted as a constraint ( the hamiltonian constraint ) ,",
    "it is usually written in the form of an energy - balance law : @xmath2 with the matter energy @xmath3 contained in some region of unit coordinate volume .",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of coordinate factors when the volume is not fixed , especially in the context of quantization . ) in this form , the hamiltonian constraint of gravity is obtained by varying the action by the lapse function @xmath4 .",
    "( for more on constraints and canonical gravity , see @xcite . )",
    "given the friedmann equation and the continuity equation @xmath5 with pressure @xmath6 , one can derive a second - order equation of motion by taking a time derivative of ( [ friedmann ] ) and eliminating @xmath7 : the raychaudhuri equation @xmath8 at this stage , we have all equations expected from the components of the isotropic einstein tensor : the time - time component providing the friedmann equation , the ( identical ) diagonal components of the spatial part amounting to the raychaudhuri equation , and all off - diagonal components vanishing identically .",
    "the equations obtained are automatically consistent with each other : by construction , the time derivative of the friedmann equation vanishes if the raychaudhuri equation holds .",
    "therefore , if the constraint imposed by the friedmann equation holds for initial values at some time , it holds at all times .",
    "this latter property is realized for a large class of systems describing versions of isotropic ( or homogeneous ) cosmology , not just for the classical one resulting from einstein s equation . as a phase - space function , @xmath9 in ( [ constraint ] ) , with the momentum @xmath10 as it follows from the variation @xmath11 of the einstein ",
    "hilbert action reduced to isotropy , plays the role of the hamiltonian generating all equations of motion in proper time .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation indeed follows from the hamiltonian equations of motion @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( the first of which is identical to the definition of the momentum @xmath14 ) .",
    "the matter terms @xmath15 and @xmath6 are realized by @xmath16 the negative change of energy by volume change .",
    "matter equations of motion follow once @xmath17 in ( [ constraint ] ) is expressed in terms of canonical degrees of freedom .    the phase - space function @xmath9 itself evolves according to the same hamiltonian law , @xmath18 and is automatically constant in time , no matter what form @xmath9 has . in homogeneous situations , the single hamiltonian constraint that determines evolution is automatically preserved and consistent with evolution equations . we can easily modify @xmath19 by any form of quantum corrections without encountering consistency problems , issuing a powerful license to cosmological model builders .",
    "consistency remains valid when we consider different choices of time .",
    "so far , the equations were in proper time @xmath20 .",
    "all other choices @xmath21 in homogeneous models are related to @xmath20 by @xmath22 , with a lapse function @xmath23 that enters hamiltonian equations as well : if @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 for any other time with @xmath26 . in the last step ,",
    "we are allowed to pull the lapse function @xmath23 inside the poisson bracket , keeping the equality satisfied as a `` weak '' one , one that is valid provided the constraint @xmath27 holds . applying the general law to the constraint itself",
    ", we again observe consistency : @xmath28 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint generates not only evolution with respect to a given time choice , but also the transition between different choices as a gauge transformation .",
    "infinitesimally , with @xmath23 close to one , we have @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and for any function @xmath31 , @xmath32 the friedmann equation , amounting to the hamiltonian constraint , is automatically invariant under changes of time , and so are its solutions . also the evolution equations are invariant if we use the jacobi identity for poisson brackets : @xmath33 rearranging , we see that the gauge - transformed @xmath31 evolves in agreement with the gauge - transformed @xmath34 , with a correction taking into account a possible gauge transformation of @xmath23 and time dependence of @xmath35 .",
    "the presence of a single hamiltonian constraint therefore ensures dynamical consistency and invariance , even if quantum modifications occur .",
    "for this reason , homogeneous minisuperspace models are a simple and popular tool to investigate possible consequences of quantum gravity and cosmology .",
    "but for the very same reason , extreme care must be exercised when such models are used for physical predictions : the trivialization of consistency conditions does not hold in a more general context , and therefore spurious results can easily be produced in their absence .      compared with minisuperspace models ,",
    "inhomogeneous cosmology presents a very different situation regarding consistency , even if inhomogeneity is small and treated perturbatively . for gravity and matter to fit together in einstein s equation or a quantum modification thereof ,",
    "a version of the contracted bianchi identity must hold . but",
    "this identity , relating different types of dynamical equations , is easily destroyed if quantum corrections , for instance those found in minisuperspace models , are inserted blindly .",
    "when amending inhomogeneous equations by quantum corrections , one must face the problem of anomaly freedom or covariance .",
    "certain relations between different dynamical equations and gauge generators , classically implemented by the contracted bianchi identity , must be preserved in the presence of quantum corrections .",
    "this well - known classical fact is often overlooked in quantum treatments , especially those making use of gauge fixing or deparameterization .",
    "gauge generators disappear when the gauge is fixed .",
    "a simple but illegitimate way out of difficult consistency problems is therefore to fix the gauge before quantum corrections are inserted .",
    "however , one then dispenses with ways to check consistency and can not be sure that results obtained are physically viable .",
    "most cases in which cosmological perturbations have been computed by gauge fixing in loop quantum cosmology , for instance , have by now been shown to be incorrect ; important effects such as signature change have been overlooked .",
    "see also the instructive discussion of @xcite in this context .",
    "we will come back to this issue later and for now continue with a classical discussion to provide more details .",
    "the first implication of the bianchi identity is the presence of constraints .",
    "if we write @xmath36 in the form @xmath37 with spatial indices `` @xmath38 , '' it becomes evident that the components @xmath39 of the einstein tensor can not contain second - order time derivatives : on the right - hand side , all factors in the three terms are at most second order in time , and there is one explicit time derivative on the left - hand side , leaving only the option of first time derivatives in @xmath39 .",
    "these components of the einstein tensor ( minus @xmath40 times the corresponding stress - energy components @xmath41 if there is matter ) are constraints on initial values , while the remaining components provide evolution equations .",
    "in contrast to minisuperspace models , we are dealing with a larger constrained system of four independent and functional constraints , the hamiltonian constraint @xmath42 and the diffeomorphism constraint @xmath43 , which are to be imposed pointwise or for all possible multiplier functions @xmath23 and @xmath44 in @xmath45=-\\int{\\rm d}^3x",
    "n(g^0_0-n^ag^0_a)\\quad\\mbox { and } \\quad d[n^a]= -\\int{\\rm    d}^3x n^a n g^0_a\\,.\\ ] ] we are dealing with an infinite number of constraints .",
    "( to define these integrations , one introduces a foliation of space - time into spatial surfaces @xmath46 , also used to set up canonical variables . the time direction @xmath47 at each point , used to define time derivatives in evolution equations ,",
    "may be different from the normal direction @xmath48 to spatial slices in space - time , a freedom parameterized as @xmath49 with the lapse function @xmath23 and the shift vector field @xmath44 .",
    "the linear combinations of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in ( [ constraints ] ) , depending on the shift @xmath44 and lapse @xmath23 , take into account that constraints refer to directions normal and tangential to spatial slices , not to coordinate directions such as the zero - index of the einstein tensor for a component along the time - evolution vector field @xmath47 . )    as before , for consistency the constraints must always hold provided they are imposed for initial values , a feature that is guaranteed by the bianchi identity as well . if we combine the einstein tensor and the stress - energy tensor @xmath52 of matter in ( [ contractedsplit ] ) , we see that @xmath53 vanishes at any time provided the constraints @xmath54 themselves ( and therefore their spatial derivatives ) vanish at that time and the evolution equations hold . by virtue of the contracted bianchi identity ,",
    "the constraints are consistent with evolution . finally , as a third consequence , we see that all equations , einstein s equation and the contracted bianchi identity as a consistency condition , are covariant and independent of coordinates used .",
    "therefore , solutions will be covariant .",
    "all equations hold irrespective of the choice of coordinates , a well - known feature in perturbative cosmology which allows one to express all equations explicitly in terms of gauge - invariant variables @xcite .",
    "as in our discussion of minisuperspace models , a canonical view is useful to analyze which consistency conditions are satisfied automatically and which ones are non - trivial . there is a hamiltonian constraint , and therefore hamiltonian equations @xmath55 are generated by a constraint @xmath56 .",
    "however , in the inhomogeneous context , the constraint is not unique ( up to a pre - factor @xmath23 ) , nor is time evolution .",
    "we have a much larger choice of possible time variables to generate evolution .",
    "the most general version of equations of motion is obtained if we use all our constraints in a linear combination , defining @xmath57:= h[n]+d[n^a]$ ] . for fixed",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath44 , the hamiltonian flow @xmath58\\}$ ] is then equivalent to lie derivatives @xmath59 along the time - evolution vector field @xmath49 in space - time , foliated by spatial slices with unit normals @xmath48 .    for all constraints to be preserved by the evolution equations they generate , we need @xmath60,h[n , n^a]\\}\\approx 0",
    "$ ] for all @xmath61 , @xmath23 , @xmath62 and @xmath44 .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , the constraints are said to form a first - class system . unlike in homogeneous models , where @xmath63 $ ] always commutes weakly with @xmath64 $ ] , the general condition is highly non - trivial and provides strong restrictions on consistent modifications of einstein s equation .",
    "quantum corrections can no longer be inserted at will .    the same constraints that generate evolution provide gauge transformations , classically equivalent to coordinate changes .",
    "we use the same general combination as before , @xmath65 $ ] , but interpret the multipliers @xmath35 and @xmath66 differently , not related to a time - evolution vector field . instead , the gauge transformation @xmath67+d[\\epsilon^a]\\}$ ] with the classical constraints is equivalent to a coordinate transformation or the lie derivative @xmath68 along the space - time vector field @xmath69 with components such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the factors of @xmath23 and @xmath44 again result because space - time coordinate changes and the components of @xmath69 refer to coordinate directions , while constraints refer to directions normal and tangential to spatial slices with normal @xmath72 . also regarding gauge invariance ,",
    "the condition of a first - class constraint algebra is then sufficient for consistency : in this case , all constraints are gauge invariant , @xmath73=\\{h[n , n^a],h[\\epsilon,\\epsilon^a]\\}\\approx 0 $ ] , and so are the evolution equations they generate . with this full set of gauge transformations",
    ", one can freely change the constant - time spatial surfaces used to define canonical variables and to integrate the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) .",
    "we are then dealing with a covariant theory of space - time , not just with a theory on a fixed spatial foliation .",
    "the crucial consistency condition for any classical constrained system , its quantization , or an effective theory thereof , is therefore that it be first class : all constraints @xmath57 $ ] must have poisson brackets that vanish when the constraints are imposed , @xmath74,h[n , n^a]\\}\\approx 0\\,.\\ ] ] for gravity , or any generally covariant space - time theory , the specific form is the hypersurface - deformation algebra @xcite @xmath75,d[n^a]\\}&= & d[{\\cal l}_{n^b}m^a ] \\label{dd } \\\\",

    "must be realized with commutators for constraint operators instead of poisson brackets , and an effective constrained system must have quantum - corrected constraints such that a first - class algebra holds with poisson brackets .",
    "if this is realized , no gauge transformations are broken by quantization and the quantum or effective theory is called anomaly - free .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , all consistency conditions that are classically implied by the contracted bianchi identity hold in the presence of quantum corrections , and the ( quantum ) theory describes space - time rather than just a family of spatial slices .",
    "this property may be achieved with exactly the same form of the algebra , or with one that shows quantum corrections not just in the constraints but also in the structure functions of the algebra , as long as two constraints still commute up to another constraint .",
    "one universal example found in loop quantum gravity , as the most prominent result regarding hypersurface deformations with quantum corrections , has ( [ dd ] ) and ( [ hd ] ) unchanged , but ( [ hh ] ) modified to @xcite @xmath77,h[n]\\}= d[\\beta q^{ab}(m\\nabla_bn - n\\nabla_bm ) ] \\label{hhbeta}\\ ] ] with some phase - space function @xmath78 .",
    "if the classical hypersurface - deformation algebra is modified , gauge transformations no longer correspond to lie derivatives by space - time vector fields . not just the dynamics but even the structure of space - time may be modified by quantum effects .",
    "we will discuss specific examples and results in later parts of this review .    by analyzing quantum or effective constraints and their algebra , one can draw conclusions about quantum space - time structures .",
    "for instance , once the full hypersurface - deformation algebra is known , one can specialize it to poincar transformations by using linear @xmath23 and @xmath44 . with @xmath79 , for instance , we have a combination of a time translation by @xmath80 and a boost by @xmath81 . with @xmath82 in ( [ hhbeta ] ) ,",
    "the usual poincar relations are modified .",
    "although this may look like a version of deformed special relativity @xcite , there is no direct relation : in deformed special relativity , one has non - linear realizations of the poincar algebra , with structure constants depending on the algebra generators . in ( [ hhbeta ] )",
    ", we have corrections of structure functions depending on phase - space degrees of freedom , not directly on the algebra generators @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "a deformed version of special relativity would require a relation between phase - space variables , such as extrinsic curvature , and some space - time generators , such as energy .",
    "relations of this form do exist in some regimes , for instance in asymptotically flat ones using the adm energy , but not in general .",
    "in general terms , the problem of canonical quantum cosmology can be formulated as follows : find quantum corrections in @xmath57 $ ] , perhaps motivated by some full theory of quantum gravity , such that these constraints remain first class .",
    "this statement presents a well - defined mathematical problem of classifying deformed algebras . for every consistent version that may exist , we can compute and analyze equations of motion by standard means , as explicitly written out above in the general classical case . at the present stage ,",
    "several examples of consistent deformations of constraints remaining first class are known , mainly from loop quantum gravity , but there is no general classification of these infinite - dimensional algebras .    as already mentioned , there are attempts to shortcut through the difficult calculation of these algebraic structures by fixing the gauge before quantum corrections or other modifications are put in .",
    "if the gauge is fixed , one would no longer consider @xmath65 $ ] as gauge generators , but only use @xmath57 $ ] as constraints and to generate evolution .",
    "some consistency conditions still need to be satisfied because the constraints are to be preserved by evolution , but this can usually be achieved more easily than in the non - gauge fixed case in which more fields are present .",
    "however , even if formally consistent versions of preserved constraints can be found in this way , such as those in @xcite , they are not guaranteed to be consistent because only a subclass of the constraint algebra can be tested when some modes are eliminated beforehand .",
    "even if these are classical gauge modes , some consistency conditions and physical effects are overlooked .",
    "moreover , the procedure is intrinsically inconsistent because one would first fix the gauge as it is determined by the classical constraints , and then proceed to modify the constraints that generate the gauge .",
    "a consistent scheme could be obtained only when the modified gauge structure is taken into account from the very beginning , but for that one would have to know a consistent version of non - gauge fixed constraints , not just of the gauge - fixed ones .",
    "finally , having fixed the gauge , there is no way of calculating general gauge - invariant observables . also here",
    ", one could only refer to the classical invariant variables , whose form however must be modified when quantum corrections are put into the constraints .",
    "note that quantum space - time structures and modified constraints in most cases imply departures from classical manifold pictures , as we will see explicitly in the examples provided later .",
    "one can no longer refer to the usual form of coordinate transformations to compute gauge - invariant variables without using the constraints explicitly . in modified space - times , the constraints are the only means to compute gauge flows and invariants , but this can be done only if the gauge has not been fixed .",
    "algebraic conditions can be simplified even more when gauge fixing is combined with deparameterization . with the latter procedure ,",
    "one chooses a phase - space degree of freedom , for instance from matter , to rewrite constraint equations as relational evolution equations with respect to this variable . not just gauge transformations but even constraints then disappear from the system , and no strong consistency conditions remain .",
    "a popular example is the coupling of a free , massless scalar field @xmath84 , whose homogeneous mode @xmath85 in an expansion @xmath86 around some background can be treated as a global time function .",
    "the canonical scalar hamiltonian @xmath87 with the momentum @xmath88 then has a purely kinetic background term and is completely independent of @xmath85 .",
    "the momentum @xmath89 is therefore a constant of motion and never becomes zero unless it vanishes identically .",
    "the background scalar @xmath85 has no turning points and is monotonic , serving as a global internal time along classical trajectories .",
    "the hamiltonian generating evolution with respect to this variable is obtained by solving the hamiltonian constraint @xmath90 ( with fixed @xmath23 as part of the gauge choice ) for @xmath91 : we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 , consistent with evolution with respect to @xmath85 where the dot stands for @xmath94 , as well as hamiltonian equations for the remaining variables , such as @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "there is just one hamiltonian generating all evolution equations , instead of a set of infinitely many constraints .",
    "almost as in minisuperspace models one can then implement in @xmath97 any quantum corrections one may desire .",
    "( in the context of cosmology , this approach has been suggested for instance in @xcite in an analysis of gowdy models and possible quantizations . )",
    "deparameterization is a powerful mathematical tool to derive properties of physical hilbert spaces , for which no general method exists in the absence of deparameterizability .",
    "( see also section  [ s : effcons ] . ) in quantum cosmology , this method has been applied in @xcite , and used recently to derive several aspects of self - adjointness and unitarity of evolution @xcite .",
    "but it can not serve as a valid procedure to evade the anomaly problem and do physical evaluations . to start with ,",
    "most realistic systems are not globally deparameterizable , with one variable having no turning points at all .",
    "moreover , also this procedure , on its own , can not weed out physical inconsistencies in spite of its formal consistency .",
    "one has the same drawbacks as in the gauge - fixed approach , and on top of that one has distinguished ( or even introduced ) one degree of freedom as time . for physical consistency",
    ", one should then show that results for observables do not depend on one s choice of time after quantization , but no systematic procedures exist to this end , constituting part of the problem of time in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion in the context of deparameterization or reduced phase - space quantization . ) and even if one thinks that the distinguished time @xmath85 should be sufficient for all physical purposes and does not worry about relating results in different times , the fact that there is no analog of the bianchi identity to constrain modifications should arouse suspicion .",
    "gauge fixing and deparameterization are not necessarily bad , but they provide reliable results only when they are used _",
    "after _ a consistent version of quantum - corrected constraints has been found .",
    "when this is the case , it is clear that all equations are consistent and gauge covariant , and instead of computing complete gauge - invariant variables for the corrected constraints , one may well pick a gauge or choose an internal time and work out physical implications .",
    "there is also a possibility of providing consistent results with gauge fixing or deparameterization before quantization , but then one would have to show that all possible gauge fixings or deparameterizations would lead to the same physical observables .",
    "this requirement can be achieved in cases of simple constraints , such as the gauss constraint of gravity in triad or connection variables as described at the end of section  [ s : sphsymm ] , but presents a much more involved problem for the complicated hamiltonian constraint .",
    "problems and physical inconsistencies arise always when the gauge or time is chosen according to the classical system , and modifications of the constraints and thereby gauge transformations are inserted later .",
    "covariance or analogs of the contracted bianchi identity severely constrain consistent versions of quantum corrections , raising the manifold and metric structures underlying space - time in general relativity to the effective or quantum level .",
    "although space - time structures and their covariance principles may then differ significantly from well - known classical ones , there is still a consistent dynamical theory independent of coordinates and gauge choices , and the set of all equations has meaningful solutions available for well - defined predictions .",
    "in addition to these restrictions on quantum corrections based on gauge aspects , the quantum theory of gravitational degrees of freedom itself should tell us what form of modifications we can have .",
    "effective equations , in general terms , describe quantum evolution by a smaller , more manageable number of degrees of freedom compared with the full quantum theory considered .",
    "when we go from classical physics to quantum physics , every degree of freedom we have at first is replaced by infinitely many parameters , for instance values the whole wave function takes at all points in configuration space .",
    "it is difficult to deal with values of wave functions in physical terms .",
    "another parameterization , more convenient for effective equations as it turns out , is the set of expectation values of basic operators , @xmath98 and @xmath99 in wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantum cosmology , together with fluctuations and higher moments @xmath100 with operators in totally symmetric , or weyl , ordering . for generic states , all these moments with integer @xmath101 and @xmath102 such that @xmath103 , are independent of one another and of the expectation values , and therefore provide infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "( for @xmath104 , for instance , we have the two fluctuations @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and the covariance @xmath107 . )",
    "any set of effective equations provides a description between the classical limit and the full quantum theory of the system considered , making use of finitely many degrees of freedom for each classical one .",
    "there may be additional degrees of freedom compared with the classical theory , but not infinitely many more . by the new degrees of freedom",
    "included and their coupling to expectation values  the variables with a direct classical analog  quantum corrections result .",
    "this is our general definition of effective theories , which we distinguish from coarse - grained theories .",

    "often , such a state dependence enters effective theories only implicitly , for instance in the unique - looking low - energy effective action @xcite free of any state parameters .",

    "quantum cosmology in its non - perturbative form , or quantum gravity in general , does not have a vacuum or other distinguished low - energy state .",
    "effective theories of quantum cosmology must therefore be more general than the low - energy effective action , leaving more freedom for states parameterized in some suitable way .",
    "even if we restrict attention to semiclassical regimes , the class of states to be considered may be large : simple gaussians provide at most a 2-parameter family within a large set of semiclassical states when they are fully squeezed . for uncorrelated gaussians , wave functions",

    "deviations from saturation are much more difficult to parameterize , but easily occur for evolved semiclassical states even if they start out as a gaussian . and",

    "it is customary to explore semiclassical features using simple and nicely peaked gaussian states . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "such states provide interesting information , and they are realized in exactly this form as coherent states or the ground state of the harmonic oscillator . in quantum field theory ,",

    ", we should therefore allow for the possibility of mixed states , again going beyond pure gaussians or other specific wave functions .",
    "moments provide a parameterization of mixed states as well since they are based only on the notion of expectation values . *",
    "the question of covariance affects also the choice of classes of states .",
    "a state chosen in a minisuperspace model must have a chance of being the reduction of a full state that does not break covariance .",
    "this question may be difficult to analyze at the level of wave functions , but it also shows that a sufficiently large freedom in the choice of states must be included in considerations that aim to provide a consistent formulation of quantum cosmology .",
    "since state properties are important for effective actions and quantum back - reaction , we should be as general as possible with the choice of states we consider . with wave functions or density matrices for mixed states ,",
    "such a generality is difficult to achieve , but it is possible with parameterizations such as the one by moments .",
    "moments provide a general form of semiclassical states , as already introduced . in effective theories , they are subject to their own evolution equations which show how they may change as high - density regimes are approached .",
    "they go well beyond the 2-parameter family of squeezed gaussians , and describe pure and mixed states alike .",
    "covariance at the level of effective equations with quantum back - reaction can be addressed by combining the moment parameterization with the methods of the previous section , deriving consistent constrained systems amended by quantum corrections that include the moments . for the last question",

    "if we extend it to polynomials of expectation values by imposing the leibniz rule , all laws for a poisson bracket are satisfied , and we can apply the definition to moments . for instance , we obtain @xmath144 and @xmath145 for all @xmath101 and @xmath102 . the moments , as defined here , are symplectically orthogonal to expectation values , a convenient feature for calculations .",
    "poisson brackets between different moments have been computed explicitly but are lengthy ; see @xcite and the correction of a typo in @xcite . for low orders , it is usually more convenient to compute poisson brackets directly from the definition ( [ poisson ] ) .",

    "if we know how a state enters effective constraints via its moments , a question which we will address in due course , we can compute poisson brackets of effective constraints and see whether they provide a consistent deformation of the classical constraint algebra .",
    "if a consistent deformation is realized , the system can be analyzed further by standard canonical means to arrive at observables and dynamical equations .",
    "note , however , that the poisson tensor for moments truncated to some order is in general not invertible , for instance on the three second - order moments which form an odd - dimensional poisson manifold : with ( [ fluctbracket ] ) and similar calculations for the other second - order moments , we obtain @xmath147 the 3-dimensional poisson manifold of second - degree polynomials .",
    "symplectic geometry therefore can not be used for effective theories , while poisson geometry is available from the definition ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "all relevant properties of constrained systems , such as the distinction between first and second class or properties of gauge transformations , can be formulated at the level of poisson geometry @xcite .      in summary of this section",
    ", we note that there are several specific issues in the derivation of effective theories for quantum cosmology , compared to other fields in which such methods are in use .",
    "the central theme is covariance , an issue which can be addressed only if one goes beyond the traditional quantum - cosmological realm of minisuperspace models .",
    "the notion of covariance and the question whether it is realized consistently may be affected by new quantum space - time structures introduced by the specific form of quantum geometry in one s approach to quantum gravity .",
    "the second , less obvious source of potential modifications of covariance is the form of dynamical quantum states used .",
    "effective actions or equations depend on the classes of quantum states whose evolution they approximate , which should be specific solutions of some underlying quantum theory of gravity .",
    "even if a theory such as quantum gravity is covariant , the selection of specific solutions may always break this symmetry .",
    "covariance may then be realized in a deformed way , or only partially within one effective theory .",
    "for instance , even if the states used are peaked on covariant classical fields , giving rise to covariant effective terms depending on expectation values , their fluctuations or higher moments may not be fully covariant .",
    "changing the gauge in quantum gravity may then require the transition to a different effective theory , in which different state parameters have been used ( reminiscent of the application of background - field methods in standard quantum field theory ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the class of states is sufficiently large , all gauge - related parameters could be encompassed within one effective theory .",
    "these considerations highlight the importance of the selection of states in the derivation of effective theories",
    ".    both quantum geometry and quantum dynamics must be part of one consistent quantum theory of gravity ; in a complete treatment , their effects therefore can not be separated from each other .",
    "however , they are derived by different means , making use of different expansions of the expectation - value function @xmath126 of the hamiltonian or hamiltonian constraint in the class of states used . in",
    "what follows , as in most derivations in the literature , we will split the treatment into one of quantum - geometry corrections first , as they are easier to see , followed by a discussion of quantum - dynamics corrections . when their expressions are known , we can compare implications of different effects and see if some are more relevant than others in specific regimes .",
    "in the canonical setting , quantum - geometry corrections are specific to loop quantum gravity which has given rise to many results regarding background - independent quantization @xcite .",
    "the effects in @xmath126 are not unique , but characteristic enough to show implications for quantum space - time structure . after an overview of these terms in the next section",
    ", we will discuss dynamical quantum back - reaction , obtained from a further expansion of @xmath126 by the moments parameterizing states .",
    "we will see the relation of canonical formulations to the low - energy effective action used in particle physics and the role of higher time derivatives in effective equations .",
    "finally , we will put together our results to find properties of general effective actions taking into account all possible effects of canonical quantum gravity , and thereby shed light on quantum space - time structure .",
    "canonical gravity implements space - time structure by imposing the constraints @xmath64+d[n^a]$ ] and requiring invariance under the gauge flow they generate .",
    "( there may be additional constraints , such as the gauss constraint if triad variables are used .",
    "such constraints , however , restrict auxiliary degrees of freedom not related to transformations of space - time . )",
    "the diffeomorphism ( and gauss ) constraint generates a simple flow by lie derivatives , and has a direct action on quantum states .",

    "dewitt quantum gravity ( leaving aside the complicated question of how to define an inner product ) we have a formal action @xmath149\\psi[q_{bc}]= \\psi[{\\cal l}_{n^a}q_{bc}]$ ] .",
    "states are annihilated by the diffeomorphism constraint if they depend only on spatial invariants , of the same form as classically , and expectation values in non - invariant states transform according to the classical gauge transformations . in loop quantum gravity ,",
    "the action on states is different because discrete spatial structures do not allow infinitesimal diffeomorphisms to be represented .",
    "but for finite diffeomorphisms , the situation is exactly as just described .",
    "therefore , we do not expect significant quantum modifications of the spatial diffeomorphism constraint ( but see section  [ s : diffeo ] ) .",
    "similarly , the gauss constraint , if there is one , has a simple and direct action that does not suggest modifications ; see also the end of section  [ s : sphsymm ] .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint @xmath150 $ ] presents a different story .",
    "it can not be quantized directly by promoting its ( complicated ) classical gauge flow to an action on states .",
    "the only procedure to arrive at a constraint operator is tedious : inserting basic operators quantizing the classical kinematical phase space into the expression for the hamiltonian constraints . as a phase - space function",
    ", the constraint contains rather involved combinations of the basic fields , which require regularization and sometimes even other modifications for a well - defined operator to result @xcite . also on general grounds",
    ", we do expect quantum corrections in the hamiltonian constraint because it includes all about the dynamics of the theory . the theory being interacting",
    ", quantum corrections must result .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is therefore the place where we should look for characteristic quantum corrections of different theories , as well as possible restrictions by consistency requirements .      a constraint operator @xmath150 $ ] restricts states by @xmath150|\\psi\\rangle_{\\rm phys}=0 $ ] and generates a gauge flow @xmath151/\\hbar)|\\psi\\rangle$ ] .",
    "physical states , on which @xmath152/\\hbar)$ ] acts as the identity , are gauge - invariant , and the gauge flow need not be considered separately if first - class constraint operators are solved .",
    "but exact solutions are complicated to find , and when quantum corrections are computed by systematic approximation schemes , the situation is quite different .",

    "these constraints in general are all independent , constraining not just expectation values but also moments . in an effective theory ,",
    "as spelled out in detail later , one solves this infinite set of quantum phase - space constraints order by order in the moments . to",
    "any given order , the sharp condition @xmath150|\\psi\\rangle_{\\rm phys}=0 $ ] for physical states is not fully implemented , and on the corresponding solution space there is a non - trivial gauge flow by quantum constraints .",
    "moreover , the effective treatment at this stage is more general because one does not assume a ( kinematical ) hilbert - space structure when solving the constraints for moments ; therefore the standard argument of a trivial gauge flow does not apply . at the effective level , there are non - trivial gauge transformations by quantum constraints , bringing solution procedures closer to classical ones : one solves phase - space constraints and factors out their gauge .    for an effective theory ,",
    "the key ingredient is therefore the expectation value @xmath153\\rangle$ ] in a sufficiently large class of states , or the general expression parameterized by the moments of states .",
    "as in ( [ qconstraint ] ) , moments then appear in quantum corrections that change the constraint surface . with a modified constraint surface ,",
    "the gauge flows must receive quantum corrections as well for them to be tangential to the constraint surface mapping solutions to constraints into other solutions , as required for a first - class system .",

    "since all expressions such as @xmath165 vanish when computed in physical states , they provide effective constraints ( in general independent of @xmath166 as phase - space functions ) . if all these constraints are imposed , the effective constrained system is first class and has a consistent gauge flow generated by all these constraints @xcite .",
    "such systems of infinitely many constraints for each local classical degree of freedom can be difficult to analyze .",
    "however , just as the moments obey a @xmath0ierarchy in semiclassical regimes , the effective constraints can be truncated to finite sets to any given order in @xmath0 or in the moments .",
    "the leading corrections can be found in direct expectation values @xmath163 , restricting expectation values with quantum corrections that depend on the moments .",
    "for instance , ( [ qconstraint ] ) , when imposed as a constraint , shows how the classical constraint surface and the gauge flow of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are changed by fluctuations @xmath167 .",
    "these corrections depend on the value of @xmath167 , which is constrained and subject to gauge flows by higher - order constraints such as @xmath168 . when all constraints have been solved and gauge flows factored out to a certain order , the condition @xmath125 has been implemented for states used in expectation values and moments .",
    "one has then computed observables in physical states , sidestepping the complicated problem of computing an integral form of the physical inner product .",
    "this is one example for the use of effective methods to tame complicated technical and conceptual issues in quantum gravity .",

    "we will come back to these conceptual question in section  [ s : effcons ] , and for now note the lesson that expectation values of constraints supply the key ingredient for effective gauge theories .",
    "we should then apply effective techniques to the hamiltonian constraint of gravity , computing @xmath153\\rangle$ ] .",
    "expressions for the hamiltonian constraint are rather complicated even classically , given by @xmath169 in adm variables , the spatial metric @xmath170 and its momentum @xmath171 in terms of extrinsic curvature ( with the spatial ricci scalar @xmath172 ) .",

    "fortunately , there are several characteristic features , common to both versions : the hamiltonian constraint is quadratic in the connection or extrinsic curvature , and it requires an inverse of the spatial metric or the densitized triad .",
    "these two features , when combined with quantum - representation properties , imply characteristic structures of quantum geometry and associated corrections to classical equations .",
    "these corrections , in turn , can be analyzed for potential implications even if their precise form can not be determined from a complete calculation of @xmath126 in semiclassical states .",

    "suitably parameterized , one can look for consistent deformations of the constraint algebra to find versions for a physical evaluation of these corrections , or to derive further restrictions on the quantization choices made .",
    "in effective equations , the use of holonomies as basic operators of the quantum theory has another consequence : the holonomy - flux algebra ( [ holflux ] ) is not canonical , with non - constant poisson brackets .",
    "moments of states used for effective descriptions are based on expectation values of basic operators , holonomies and fluxes in loop - quantized models .",
    "the general constructions of effective theories still go through : poisson brackets on the quantum phase space , the quantum hamiltonian or constraints , and so on . however , the explicit poisson relations ( [ poisson ] ) evaluated between individual moments of the form @xmath211 are different from the canonical case .",
    "in particular , moments no longer poisson - commute with expectation values .",
    "this feature requires care and complicates some calculations .",
    "these problems , however , are only technical ; see the examples provided later in section  [ s : harmlqc ] and in @xcite .",
    "fluxes are linear in the densitized triad and do not suggest the same kind of modification as holonomies .",
    "nevertheless , there is a characteristic effect associated also with them .",
    "flux operators have discrete spectra , containing zero as an eigenvalue .",
    "such operators do not have densely - defined inverses , and yet we need an inverse of the densitized triad for the classical hamiltonian constraint . to obtain such quantizations , a more indirect route is taken in loop quantum gravity , which does result in well - defined operators but introduces another kind of correction , called inverse - triad correction .    to see the form of these corrections ,",
    "we show a lattice calculation of inverse - triad operators .",
    "as proposed in @xcite , the combination of triad components required for the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hash ] ) is first rewritten as @xmath212 in the new form , no inverse is needed , @xmath184 can be expressed by holonomies , the volume operator can be used for @xmath213 , and the poisson bracket be turned into a commutator divided by @xmath214 .",
    "the resulting operators are rather contrived , especially with su(2 ) holonomies and derivatives involved .",
    "but the presence of corrections and their qualitative form can be illustrated by a u(1)-calculation , for which we also assume regular cubic lattices .    on a cubic lattice",
    ", we can assign a unique plaquette to each link @xmath189 , by which we then label fluxes .",
    "our basic operators are @xmath200 , which as a multiplication operator by @xmath215 takes values in u(1 ) , and @xmath216 for a fixed set of edges @xmath189 in a regular cubic lattice .",
    "we are therefore computing inverse - triad operators and their expectation values for a fixed subset of cylindrical states , but the lattice can be as fine as we want , allowing us to capture all continuum degrees of freedom .",
    "for this u(1)-simplification , the holonomy - flux algebra , quantizing an abelian version of ( [ holflux ] ) , reads @xmath217= -8\\pi\\gamma\\ell_{\\rm p}^2\\hat{h}_e$ ] while all operators commute if they belong to different edges .",
    "moreover , the u(1)-valuedness of holonomies implies the reality condition @xmath218 , which we will make use of below .",
    "we first rewrite ( [ inverse ] ) in terms of holonomies instead of connection components , and express the volume @xmath219 by lattice fluxes @xmath220 per vertex , with the three fluxes through plaquettes in all three directions around the vertex : @xmath221 or , more symmetrically , @xmath222 , computes the poisson bracket at the vertex .",
    "since @xmath201 commutes with all but one of the @xmath223 , we can focus on one of them , @xmath224 . keeping the power more general",
    ", the quantization of some inverse power of flux takes the form @xmath225 for any @xmath226 we quantize an inverse power of @xmath227 but need not use any inverse in the commutator .    following @xcite , we can now easily simplify these operators , if we observe the relations of the u(1)-holonomy - flux algebra , together with the reality condition .",
    "these relations imply @xmath228 such that @xmath229 eigenvalues of this operator can easily be computed , with eigenstates equal to flux eigenstates @xcite .",
    "all eigenvalues are finite , as required for a densely - defined operator , and show how the classical divergence of @xmath230 at @xmath231 is cut off . for inverse - triad corrections in effective hamiltonians ,",
    "however , we need expectation values of @xmath232 in semiclassical states . explicit calculations would require good knowledge of semiclassical wave functions or coherent states .    for general effective equations it is sufficient , and even more useful , to perform a moment expansion , keeping the specific state free and parameterized by moments .",
    "staying at the expectation - value order of effective expressions , we have @xmath233 already to this order we see characteristic corrections ( depending on @xmath0 via the planck length ) .",
    "inverse - triad corrections therefore have a contribution independent of quantum back - reaction .    interpreting @xmath234 as the discrete quantum - gravity scale ( the lattice spacing as measured by flux operators )",

    "corrections are strong for @xmath238 or smaller , typically in the deep quantum regime , where @xmath237 drops to zero at @xmath239 .",
    "however , even for larger @xmath240 , @xmath241 is not identical to one and implies interesting corrections .",
    "in addition to corrections contained in ( [ alpha ] ) and quantum back - reaction from moment terms , the flux dependence implies corrections from a derivative expansion of the integrations involved , as already seen for holonomies .",
    "moreover , non - abelian holonomies do not lead to exact cancellations in the substitution of @xmath242 for @xmath243 and rather imply additional higher - order corrections by powers of @xmath184 @xcite . as noted in the context of holonomy corrections , such extra terms mix with higher - curvature corrections .",
    "the leading term in ( [ alpha ] ) , on the other hand , shows a different dependence on parameters that distinguish a given cosmological regime and are more characteristic .",
    "their effects can thus be studied in isolation .",
    "we have already stated that the diffeomorphism constraint can be quantized by its direct action on spatial functions or other objects such as curves and surfaces . in loop quantum gravity , for instance , a diffeomorphism @xmath244 acts by shifting all arguments of a cylindrical function by @xmath245 , the usual pull - back of functions .",
    "the representation of the holonomy - flux algebra is diffeomorphism covariant under this action , showing that no quantum corrections to classical diffeomorphisms result .",
    "it is not possible to compute or represent an infinitesimal action or the diffeomorphism constraint because two states that differ by a non - trivial diffeomorphism are either identical ( if the diffeomorphism does not change the underlying graph ) or orthogonal . but finite diffeomorphisms suffice to remove the related gauge , which is done without quantum corrections .    nevertheless , the situation is not completely satisfactory because the diffeomorphism constraint is a crucial ingredient of the hypersurface - deformation algebra .",
    "if diffeomorphisms are represented without quantum corrections , there should be no deformations of the relations ( [ dd ] ) and ( [ hd ] ) of the hypersurface - deformation algebra for commutators involving at least one spatial deformation .",
    "however , the diffeomorphism constraint also appears on the right - hand side of ( [ hh ] ) , the crucial part for space - time structure . on the left - hand side",
    ", we have two hamiltonian constraints , which we do quantize in loop quantum gravity and whose commutators we can , in principle , compute .",
    "the result should be a well - defined operator , which must vanish on physical states for the quantization to be anomaly - free .",
    "however , classically it corresponds to a diffeomorphism constraint , which can not be represented directly .    to check for anomaly freedom , one",
    "must then find an operator version of the right - hand side of ( [ hh ] ) , taking into account the structure function @xmath76 , to be turned into an operator as well .",
    "this is one of the most important but still outstanding issues in loop quantum gravity , which was evaded by the arguments of @xcite and only partially addressed by the advanced constructions of @xcite .",
    "more recently , the issue has been revisited in several models @xcite , with encouraging results . at least in u(1)-versions of @xmath246-dimensional gravity",
    ", one can indeed make sense of the right - hand side of ( [ hh ] ) as an operator , in such a way that the quantum constraint algebra is anomaly - free .",

    "do not seem required because , in any canonical space - time theory , one is dealing with fields as functions on space .",
    "these functions are represented using some coordinates , but physics as always must be independent of the choice .",
    "there must therefore be a part of the gauge content of the theory that requires independence under arbitrary changes of spatial coordinates or , infinitesimally , invariance under spatial lie derivatives .",
    "but then , a gauge transformation that amounts to a lie derivative of all fields must have a generator identical to the diffeomorphism constraint uniquely associated with the fields @xcite .",
    "the spatial structure assumed in canonical formulations leaves no room for corrections in the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "the space - time structure is not presupposed in canonical quantum gravity and may well change , as indicated by some quantum corrections in the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "space - time , unlike space , has dynamical content and can easily receive quantum corrections , as borne out in loop quantum gravity . having",
    "the classical structure of space but modified space - time is therefore consistent .",
    "nevertheless , in an effort to relax some of the general assumptions of canonical formulations , one could expect changes to the spatial manifold structure as well , as perhaps indicated by potential corrections in the diffeomorphism constraint such as those in @xcite .",
    "comparing holonomy and inverse - triad corrections , we have several important properties :    * holonomy corrections crucially add higher powers of the connection to the classical quadratic form of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "in flat isotropic cosmological models , the connection is proportional to the hubble parameter @xmath247 , which in turn is proportional to the square root of the energy density .",
    "holonomy corrections in cosmological models therefore depend on the dimensionless parameters @xmath248 or @xmath249 , both of which are tiny in observationally accessible regimes",

    "it is not easy to estimate @xmath240 , but the dimensionless ratio associated with it certainly need not be small .",
    "inverse - triad corrections can be more significant than holonomy corrections in observationally accessible regimes .",
    "( the scale @xmath240 may change in time , depending on the form of lattice refinement realized @xcite . ) * holonomy corrections and inverse - triad corrections are both obtained from properties of integrated objects , holonomies and fluxes .",
    "one should therefore expect not just higher - order terms as in the expansions already discussed , but also higher spatial derivatives in a derivative expansion of inhomogeneous models . for holonomy corrections , higher - derivative terms",
    "are crucial because they should be part of higher - curvature corrections together with higher powers of the connection that immediately arise from expanded holonomies .",
    "only a suitable combination of higher powers and derivatives can result in consistent covariant versions . * following up on the last item ,",
    "we also need higher time derivatives to complete higher - order corrections to covariant objects related to curvature .",
    "such corrections should be present even in homogeneous models , but are not easy to see directly from the form of holonomies",
    ". however , such terms can not be ignored , because high - curvature regimes have significant contributions from higher - order and higher - derivative terms . in isotropic models , @xmath250 and @xmath251",

    "an expansion of holonomies only by @xmath247 ( related to the isotropic connection ; see section  [ s : modfried ] ) but ignoring higher time derivatives would be inconsistent . to see how higher time derivatives arise in canonical quantum theories , we have to pause our description of loop quantum gravity and return to more details of quantum back - reaction .",
    "for a canonical effective theory , quantum hamiltonians and quantum constraints @xmath126 , generating evolution or gauge flows by ( [ dodt ] ) , must be expanded systematically by moments of states to see all quantum effects .",
    "this is also the case for individual non - linear correction functions such as @xmath252 of inverse triads ( [ iexp ] ) or @xmath253 of holonomies as they may be implied by quantum - geometry effects of loop quantum gravity .",
    "additional terms , products of expectation values and moments , are then added to the constraints .",
    "the correctness of the quantum dynamics resulting from a moment - expanded @xmath126 can be illustrated with a quantum - mechanical example .",

    "the quantum potential is defined as a function on the infinite - dimensional quantum phase space of expectation values and moments , whose poisson structure is given by ( [ poisson ] ) . in a quantum hamiltonian @xmath263",
    "we therefore have terms generating a dynamical flow of the moments by @xmath264 the coupled set of equations for expectation values and moments , ( [ ehrenfest ] ) and ( [ deltadot ] ) , is equivalent to the schrdinger flow of quantum mechanics , but its solutions do not provide wave functions but rather variables directly related to observations .",
    "it can be solved with different approximations , most importantly a semiclassical one by the order of moments , sometimes combined with an adiabatic one . in the latter case ,",
    "applied to anharmonic oscillators , effective equations are equivalent to those of the low - energy effective action @xcite .",
    "the validity and usefulness of the canonical effective scheme is thereby established .    in the context of quantum gravity ,",
    "the feature of higher time derivatives in effective equations , a crucial ingredient of higher - curvature corrections , is of particular interest .",
    "the moments are related to such terms , although not in a direct way .",
    "equation ( [ ehrenfest ] ) combined with ( [ fq ] ) already shows that a specific linear combination of the moments , with coefficients depending on expectation values , amounts to the time derivative of the momentum , or the second derivative of the position expectation value .",
    "higher than second time derivatives of @xmath258 can be computed by taking further derivatives of ( [ ehrenfest ] ) and inserting @xmath265 and , for higher than third order , @xmath266 according to equations of motion ( [ deltadot ] ) generated by the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "different combinations of the moments therefore provide all higher time derivatives of @xmath258 . with the scheme just sketched , it is difficult to invert the equations to find expressions for moments in terms of higher time derivatives , or to eliminate all moments and end up with a higher - derivative equation just for @xmath258 instead of the moment - coupled ( [ ehrenfest ] ) , ( [ fq ] ) and ( [ deltadot ] ) . but with more - refined methods , as well as an adiabatic expansion , this task can be performed . for quantum cosmology",

    "to avoid such a restrictive condition , we proceed to higher adiabatic orders , from order @xmath278 to order @xmath279 by inserting time derivatives of @xmath280 on the left - hand sides of ( [ dqqdt])([dppdt ] ) to compute @xmath281 on the right - hand sides .",

    "without any symmetry assumptions , requiring irregular lattices and non - abelian su(2)-features , it is complicated to derive inverse - triad operators or to parameterize holonomy corrections .",
    "one therefore starts using all information about such correction functions that can be obtained in tractable models , such as a homogeneous background , and inserts those background functions just like @xmath487 , @xmath512 , @xmath513 , @xmath514 , @xmath515 and @xmath516 in spherically symmetric models .",

    "the condition of anomaly - freedom is often so restrictive that the counterterms can be derived uniquely from known inverse - triad or holonomy correction functions of the background .",
    "consistent constraints can therefore be computed even if not all quantum corrections are known in detail .",
    "another small difference between spherical symmetry and cosmological perturbations is the treatment of the su(2)-gauge .",
    "in spherical symmetry , ( [ dsph ] ) and ( [ hqsph ] ) are manifestly invariant under these transformations , even after deformation by quantum corrections . in perturbative treatments , on the other hand ,",
    "one usually fixes a background triad , including its su(2)-gauge .",
    "but then , one can see that physical results and the deformation of the space - time algebra are independent of the specific su(2)-fixing chosen .",
    "the constructions are therefore consistent even if some gauge has been fixed : all gauge fixings produce the same results .",
    "( the same arguments can be applied to the time gauge used to descend from space - time tetrads to spatial triads . )",
    "such consistent derivations in the presence of gauge fixing are possible in simple cases such as the gauss constraint , which moreover survives unmodified after quantization .",
    "making gauge - fixings consistent is much less trivial if attempted for complicated constraints such as @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "first , it is difficult to find any good gauge fixing in general terms ; having to study even all possible gauge fixings and to make sure that physical results do not depend on the choice is then nearly impossible .",
    "in such cases , the only manageable approach is to forgo gauge fixing before quantization or deformation , even if it makes derivations more complicated than in one given gauge .",
    "the hypersurface - deformation algebra encodes the space - time structure of generally covariant theories just as the poincar algebra encodes special relativity s structure",
    ". one can recover the poincar relations by using functions @xmath23 and @xmath44 linear in some coordinates amounting to minkowski space - time or a local minkowski patch .",
    "for instance , two linear lapse functions of the form @xmath535 , inserted in ( [ hh ] ) , provide the commutator of lorentz boosts by velocity @xmath81 and time translations @xmath80 . inserting two such functions , @xmath536 and @xmath537 , on the right - hand side of ( [ hh ] )",

    "even if @xmath78 is not exactly @xmath544 but negative , the structure is best described as euclidean even though we do not have classical euclidean space ( just as we do not have classical minkowski space if @xmath78 is positive but not exactly @xmath545 ) .",
    "points in the opposite direction : the sign in the commutator of two normal deformations is reversed .",
    "[ hypdeflin],height=188 ]    signature change is not only a drastic reminder that we can not take much of our usual concepts for granted when space - time is quantized .",
    "it also shows the limitations of approaches in which gauge - fixing or deparameterization is used before quantization or modifications of the constraint .",
    "if one fixes the gauge before quantization , one can only assume the classical space - time structure , which does not allow signature change .",
    "after gauge fixing and quantization , the full space - time structure can no longer be accessed , leaving one with the conclusion that space - time is unmodified . however , since the constraints are modified in quantization after gauge fixing and determine the gauge and space - time structure , the procedure becomes intrinsically inconsistent .",
    "deparameterization can not capture all quantum space - time effects either .",
    "when one distinguishes a phase - space degree of freedom to measure change and evolution , there is no guarantee that this degree of freedom actually behaves like time in a space - time sense .",
    "also euclidean theories can formally be deparameterized ( internal time simply parameterizes gauge orbits of the hamiltonian constraint ) , showing that deparameterized `` evolution '' does not necessarily imply evolution in a temporal sense .",
    "again , only a complete analysis of the off - shell constraint algebra , without eliminating some of its more complicated ingredients by gauge - fixing or deparameterization , can show what space - time structure is realized .    in our diagrams",
    "so far , we have assumed that normals are drawn using either minkowski or euclidean geometry .",
    "we did not use quantum corrections of angles even though distances and displacements did receive corrections as a consequence of the algebra ( [ hhbeta ] ) .",
    "one may expect angles to change too , in particular angles of normals to spatial slices drawn to visualize the commutator of two time deformations .",
    "such corrections could indeed happen , in general deformations of space - time structures , but since the angle between space and time directions would be involved , they would amount to deformations of the commutator ( [ hd ] ) of a time and a space deformation .",

    ", however , it is no longer consistent to treat holonomy corrections in isolation because they mix with quantum back - reaction , together forming higher - curvature corrections .",
    "so far , no consistent deformation of the constraint algebra has been found for quantum corrections caused by quantum back - reaction , adding moment - dependent terms to the classical constraints .",
    "the problem is well - defined because we know the poisson algebra of moments , and even though canonical effective field theory techniques remain incomplete , one could use those of quantum mechanical models in loop quantum gravity restricted to fixed graphs . in any finite region , there would then be a finite , though large , number of degrees of freedom given by link holonomies and plaquette fluxes .",
    "( most calculations in the full theory are done with fixed graphs , anyway . )",

    "if hamiltonian constraint operators are self - adjoint , the commutator @xmath562,\\hat{h}[n]]/i\\hbar$ ] quantizing @xmath563,h[n]\\}$ ] in ( [ hh ] ) is self - adjoint too .",
    "but classically the bracket equals a product of the local diffeomorphism constraint @xmath564 with the structure function @xmath76 , two expressions that have a non - vanishing poisson bracket because @xmath76 is not diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "any quantization of the product @xmath565 can then be self - adjoint and have a chance of agreeing with @xmath562,\\hat{h}[n]]/i\\hbar$ ] only if a symmetric ordering is used .",
    "but if one simply reorders `` @xmath566 '' symmetrically , a metric factor would come to lie to the right of the diffeomorphism constraint , and the product would no longer annihilate physical states",
    ". an anomalous version of the constraints would be obtained .    in an effective description ,",
    "the situation is more manageable .",
    "first , one can use calculations of poisson brackets instead of commutators of operators , even in the presence of quantum corrections and ordering choices .",
    "moreover , quantum corrections may be suitably parameterized , to take into account different ordering choices , quantization ambiguities in the representation of inverse - triad and holonomy operators , and general classes of states in terms of their moments .",
    "one can compute poisson brackets with ambiguity functions , such as ( [ alpha ] ) , or moment terms unspecified , and see what conditions anomaly - freedom imposes on them . an operator calculation with free functions or states , by comparison , would be much more involved .",
    "the self - adjointness question can be left open at first by allowing for complex - valued constraints  kinematical moments appearing in effective constraints are complex - valued anyway , even in the absence of structure - function issues , as seen in section  [ s : effcons ] . with this strategy",
    "the first consistent deformations of the form ( [ hhbeta ] ) have been found @xcite , by now confirmed also by operator calculations @xcite .",
    "the effective view is therefore reliable and powerful also in the context of the anomaly problem .",
    "moments and their quantum back - reaction , if they appear in a consistent deformation of the constraint algebra , are the canonical analog of higher - curvature terms with their higher time derivatives",
    ". however , their form is not directly one of higher time derivatives , and additional steps and expansions , primarily an adiabatic one , are required to put canonical effective equations in the form of higher - derivative ones ; see section  [ s : adia ] .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is not always applicable .",
    "it serves well for anharmonic oscillators expanded around the harmonic vacuum with its constant moments .",
    "moments of the anharmonic vacuum change , but only slowly , and can be treated adiabatically . solving for moments order by order in the adiabatic expansion",
    "then shows how they are related to higher time derivatives of expectation values .",
    "the same statements hold true in quantum field theory , where one expands around the free vacuum in order to describe excitations around the interacting vacuum using the low - energy effective action .",
    "these features have given rise to the expectation that quantum gravity should be subject only to higher - curvature corrections .",
    "however , two hidden assumptions are required for this conclusion .",
    "first , one assumes that quantum gravity implies corrections only in the dynamics of gravitons , say , not in the underlying space - time structure .",
    "since gravity theories are fundamentally about space - time structure , this assumption , valid in a perturbative context of excitations on a fixed background , need not be true in general .",
    "the second assumption is that quantum gravity can be realized perturbatively around some free theory of the usual form .",
    "also this statement may be true for perturbations around a fixed background and perhaps some other situations , but it is not always valid .",
    "quantum gravity is not expected to have a non - perturbative ground state , and other distinguished states may be very different from gaussians as they appear in the harmonic - oscillator ground state or free vacuum states .",
    "such states may not allow adiabaticity of the moments , and therefore can not have a dynamics fully expressed by higher time derivatives .",
    "indeed , examples in quantum cosmology are known in which the adiabaticity assumption is difficult to realize consistently @xcite . even for anharmonic oscillators ,",
    "the adiabatic approximation is not valid when one perturbs around correlated coherent states , such as fully squeezed gaussians , of the harmonic oscillator instead of the ground state @xcite .    instead of a higher - curvature or other higher - derivative effective theory ,",
    "canonical quantum gravity has higher - dimensional effective systems in which the moments play the role of independent degrees of freedom in addition to expectation values .",
    "they are subject to their own equations of motion , and by quantum back - reaction couple to them , as e.g.  in ( [ dqdt])([dppdt ] ) .",
    "their effect can be formulated by higher - derivative terms only in certain regimes , but not in general .",
    "so far , we have stayed in the canonical framework and dealt with effective equations and constraints .",
    "complementary information can be obtained if a corresponding effective action is found . in principle , there is a one - to - one correspondence between canonical and lagrangian formulations , but in perturbative settings , especially those that imply higher derivatives , the transformation is far from obvious .",
    "a derivative expansion of a lagrangian may then correspond to a complicated resummation of a derivative - expanded hamiltonian .",
    "it is therefore of interest to look for and study effective actions even if effective canonical equations are already known .",
    "there are several examples in which effective actions have proven their usefulness in quantum cosmology .",
    "euclidean path - integral techniques have been developed and applied to questions such as tunneling probabilities and some semiclassical issues @xcite .",
    "as expected , in semiclassical regimes , corrections to einstein s equation are of higher - curvature form .",
    "also causal dynamical triangulations have led to effective actions of cosmological systems by comparing detailed numerical studies of volume fluctuations with the dynamics of minisuperspace models @xcite . by matching volume correlation functions with results expected from a higher - curvature effective action ,",
    "quantum corrections can be derived .",
    "a general comparison involving also possible modifications to quantum space - time structure on top of higher - curvature corrections has not yet been completed .",
    "effective actions of such forms often show more directly than other types of effective equations when quantum effects become significant .",
    "effective actions based on path integrals are subject to modified quantum space - time structures just as canonical effective equations and constraints .",
    "path integration for gravitational theories requires an integration over all metrics , with a suitable measure that preserves covariance and does not introduce anomalies .",
    "such a measure has not been found in complete generality , indicating that one encounters in this approach the same difficulties that appear when one tries to represent the canonical constraint algebra consistently .",
    "the path - integral measure is indeed the place to look at when one is interested in possible space - time modifications , but its incomplete nature does not give many clues .",
    "canonical theories , with consistent deformations of the constraint algebra found in recent years , have been able to make more progress in this direction .",
    "( the spin - foam approach @xcite attempts to take the results of loop quantum gravity regarding background - independent representations to a level comparable to path - integrals @xcite .",
    "however , while some aspects of integrations over the space of metrics can be clarified , the issue of the correct measure , or spin - foam face amplitudes , remains open also here @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding these problems , traditional effective - action techniques have been applied to spin foams in @xcite . )",
    "another question in path - integral based approaches is how the state dependence enters effective actions .",
    "the low - energy effective action can be computed quite conveniently with path integrals , but it hides the fact that one is expanding around the ground state . if one tries to go beyond this limitation , which in quantum cosmology with its lack of ground states is a severe one , the required calculations become much more involved .",
    "suitable states would have to be implemented by additional wave - function factors in the path integral , and integrations would no longer be gaussian for general states .",
    "moreover , since path integrals in their most common form provide transition amplitudes between two states separated by some finite time , one would have to put in the initial and final state .",
    "compared to effective canonical equations , which only require initial moments to be specified , more a - priori information about the physical system is therefore required . in quantum cosmology , this information is not easily found by independent means , but is important for an analysis especially of the planckian regime .",
    "in this situation , a combination of canonical and lagrangian effective methods is of interest .",
    "as already mentioned , it may be difficult to perform a transformation for constrained systems , especially those with higher - derivative terms .",
    "if the relation between the momenta and time derivatives of configuration variables involves higher derivatives , as easily happens with quantum - gravity corrections such as holonomy modifications , the lagrangian would appear as a complicated resummation of the higher - derivative expansion of the hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , even if one can legendre transform the hamiltonian constraint to arrive at a lagrangian , one would , for a comparison with path integrals , still have to look for a measure under which the modified lagrangian is covariant . also integrating the lagrangian to an action",
    "requires new constructions even though just a classical measure on space - time is needed .",
    "however , with space - time structures modified and effective metrics non - existent  see section  [ s : spacetimecons ]  defining space - time integrations is non - trivial .",
    "measure issues , therefore , can not be resolved easily , but at least an effective lagrangian for further classical - type analysis may still be found .    instead of attempting a legendre transformation ,",
    "the canonical methods of @xcite can be used to derive a lagrangian ( or the constraints themselves ) directly from a modified constraint algebra , to any given order in derivatives . if only second - order derivatives are assumed and the constraint algebra is classical , the einstein ",
    "hilbert action as a two - parameter family with newton s and the cosmological constant is obtained as the unique solution .",
    "if higher derivative orders are allowed , one expects higher - curvature corrections as well . and if even the constraint algebra is quantum corrected , as suggested by loop quantum gravity , stronger corrections , also to second derivative order , are obtained . with this procedure of `` regaining '' a lagrangian from the constraint algebra one can sidestep the complicated resummations that a legendre transformation from modified constraints to the higher - derivative lagrangian would imply .",
    "not all coefficients in the lagrangian may follow uniquely , especially if higher derivatives are included leaving several options of higher - curvature invariants of the same order .",
    "but the general form of modifications and implications for quantum space - time structure can still be found .      to spell out the general procedure ,",
    "let us assume that we have a hamiltonian or hamiltonian constraint @xmath567 depending on canonical fields @xmath568 and @xmath569 in space .",
    "we introduce @xmath570 as a new independent variable in place of @xmath363 , and then expand equations by this newly defined @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath19 is a hamiltonian generating evolution in some fixed time parameter , we have @xmath571 by hamilton s equations . if @xmath19 is a hamiltonian constraint in the absence of an absolute time , @xmath572\\}$ ] is the derivative of @xmath329 in a direction normal to spatial slices .",
    "for gravitational variables with @xmath329 the metric or triad , @xmath81 would therefore be related to extrinsic curvature .",
    "this change of variables amounts to what is needed for a legendre transformation from @xmath325 with hamiltonian @xmath19 to @xmath573 with lagrangian @xmath574 , whose form will result as a solution of the @xmath81-expanded equations .",
    "note that we can not always assume the hamiltonian to be local and free of derivatives of @xmath363 , which would imply that partial derivatives could be used to compute @xmath81 .",
    "holonomy corrections in loop quantum gravity , for instance , introduce higher spatial derivatives of the momentum conjugate to the densitized triad . in such situations , there is no local relation between the hamiltonian and the lagrangian , and explicitly performing a legendre transformation is complicated .    instead of computing the transformation ,",
    "we intend to calculate the lagrangian directly from the constraint algebra , assuming from now on the relations of the ( deformed ) hypersurface - deformation algebra . using the definition of @xmath81 and @xmath575 for the unsmeared hamiltonian constraint and the lagrangian density , we write the poisson bracket ( [ hhbeta ] ) of two hamiltonian constraints as @xmath576,h[m]\\ } & = & -\\int{\\rm d}^3x\\int{\\rm d}^3y \\frac{\\delta l(y)}{\\delta     q(x ) }   v(x ) n(y)m(x)- ( n\\leftrightarrow m)\\\\ & = & \\int{\\rm d}^3x \\beta d^a(x ) ( n\\nabla_am - m\\nabla_an)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the local diffeomorphism constraint @xmath577 .",
    "taking functional derivatives by @xmath23 and @xmath61 , we arrive at the functional equation @xmath578 for @xmath579 , which can be solved once an expression for the diffeomorphism constraint @xmath577 is inserted , depending on whether @xmath329 refers to gravity or some matter field . in all cases , @xmath577 is linear in the momenta .",
    "a linear equation for @xmath240 is thus obtained @xcite .",
    "if ( [ dd ] ) and ( [ hd ] ) are unmodified , standard expressions for @xmath577 can be used .",
    "( see section  [ s : diffeo ] for a discussion of possible further modifications . )      to illustrate the regaining procedure , we look at a scalar matter field @xmath84 without derivative couplings , whose hamiltonian obeys the ( deformed ) hypersurface - deformation algebra on its own , without adding the gravitational piece .",
    "the lagrangian density must be of the form @xmath580 where @xmath581\\}$ ] , as before , is the normal scalar velocity and @xmath582 is the only remaining scalar that can be formed from @xmath84 and its derivatives , to a total derivative order of at most two .",
    "higher derivatives may easily result in interacting matter or quantum - gravity theories , with higher time derivatives from quantum back - reaction and higher spatial ones , additionally , from possible discretizations .",
    "( see e.g.@xcite for information about discretized space - time theories . ) for now , however , we look for modifications implied by corrections that leave the classical derivative order unchanged .    with the canonical variables of a scalar field and its diffeomorphism constraint @xmath583 , eq .",
    "( [ functionall ] ) assumes the form @xmath584 as in @xcite , we write @xmath585 it follows that @xmath586 satisfies the equation @xmath587 , shown in @xcite to imply @xmath588 .",
    "thus , @xmath589 and @xmath240 must be of the form @xmath590 . with non - trivial deformation , @xmath82 ,",
    "the scalar field therefore obeys a modified dispersion relation .",
    "the kinetic term of the lagrangian does not depend on @xmath591 in space - time terms , but has its time derivatives in @xmath592 rescaled by the correction function @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting modified dispersion relation is in agreement with the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) .    at the canonical level , for comparison ,",
    "we begin with a matter hamiltonian density of the form @xmath593 with general inverse - triad correction functions @xmath594 and @xmath108 , and some potential @xmath327 .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian density , with @xmath595 , takes the form @xmath596 this function has the same kinetic dependence as derived above , provided that @xmath597 , exactly the requirement for an anomaly - free constraint algebra in the presence of inverse - triad corrections , where @xmath486 @xcite .",
    "purely canonically , this consistency condition can be seen to ensure causality in the sense that gravitational waves on quantum space - time travel at the speed of light , modified by a factor of @xmath598 compared to the classical speed @xcite .",
    "no super - luminal propagation happens when anomaly - freedom is taken into account , even if propagation speeds may be larger than the classical speed of light for @xmath599 .      for gravity ,",
    "one example has been worked out in quite some detail with these methods : inverse - triad corrections of loop quantum gravity .",
    "these corrections have a characteristic component independent of higher derivatives , and therefore can be analyzed already at the level of second - order equations . the resulting second - order",
    "effective lagrangian , regained from a modified constraint algebra with a correction function @xmath78 independent of curvature components , is @xmath600 with `` velocities '' @xmath601 , defined again as normal derivatives @xcite . for classical gravity",
    ", @xmath602 would be proportional to extrinsic curvature .",
    "compared with the classical action obtained for @xmath603 , the notion of covariance has changed : space and time derivatives are corrected by different coefficients @xmath598 of @xmath182 and @xmath604 of @xmath605 , respectively .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that the underlying constraint algebra is modified , taking the form ( [ hhbeta ] ) .",
    "for this reason , as already mentioned in the context of line elements , the manifold structure required to integrate @xmath606 to an effective action is not clear .",
    "nevertheless , the effective lagrangian shows several characteristic effects .",
    "first , inverse - triad corrections , having implications even without higher - derivative or higher - order terms in @xmath601 , can easily be separated from holonomy effects and higher - curvature corrections .",
    "they are especially significant for small fluxes , where @xmath78 becomes small . with these constructions , it is possible to use inverse - triad corrections even when they imply strong modifications , regimes in which one would otherwise have to include full holonomy and higher - curvature corrections as well .",
    "these latter types of corrections are indeed present , but affect only higher orders in the @xmath81-expansion .",
    "inverse - triad effects up to quadratic order in @xmath81 are reliable even if the other corrections are not known precisely .",
    "time derivatives are then dominant compared to the spatial ricci scalar when @xmath78 approaches zero at small fluxes , indicating that near - singular geometries are controlled by homogeneous dynamics , strengthening the classical bkl scenario @xcite by a no - singularity scenario in loop quantum gravity @xcite . while holonomy effects can not easily be seen at this level since they would manifest themselves only at higher orders in @xmath601 and mix with higher - derivative terms , they have one drastic implication at high density if they are dominant .",
    "then , the holonomy correction function @xmath78 becomes negative , a feature taken into account by the sign factors in ( [ effac ] ) .",
    "when the sign changes , the signature does too : at the lagrangian level , one can interpret the effect by turning @xmath21 into @xmath607 in ( [ effac ] ) with @xmath601 interpreted as first - order time derivatives .",
    "( the constraint algebra again provides a rigorous interpretation of this signature change ; see section  [ s : deform ] . ) at planckian densities , holonomy effects are so strong that they turn space - time into a quantum version of 4-dimensional euclidean space , lacking time and evolution .",
    "temporal interpretations of high - density holonomy implications , such as bounces , are incorrect .",
    "only large higher - derivative terms could prevent @xmath78 from turning negative , but then other holonomy effects such as bounces would go away too .",
    "it is difficult to test quantum cosmology by any observational means , and given the substantial lack of control over deep quantum regimes , devising high - density scenarios of the universe remains a highly speculative exercise .",
    "higher - curvature corrections , as they always appear in quantum gravity and cosmology except in the most simple harmonic models , are not relevant at currently accessible scales .",
    "they are certainly important in the planckian regime , but then the present theories are so uncontrolled that it is impossible to derive clear effects , and even if some could be suggested , they would most likely be washed away by the immense amount of subsequent cosmic expansion .",
    "if one goes beyond higher - curvature corrections as computed for wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantum cosmology in @xcite , using for instance quantum - geometry effects from loop quantum gravity , the situation has a chance of being more optimistic .",
    "several investigations have been performed @xcite , but not all are based on consistent implementations of inhomogeneity . the general picture is therefore still incomplete .",
    "one type of corrections , holonomy modifications , provides contributions of higher powers of the connection or extrinsic curvature , very similar to some parts of higher - curvature corrections .",
    "holonomy corrections therefore can not be separated from higher - curvature effects , and can not provide more - sizeable consequences regarding observations .    moreover , the quantum space - time structure corresponding to holonomy corrections remains incompletely understood .",
    "consistent deformations of the classical constraint algebra with some holonomy - like effects are known in spherically symmetric models @xcite , @xmath246-dimensional gravity @xcite and for cosmological perturbations @xcite . however , in spherically symmetric and cosmological models , only `` pointwise '' holonomy modifications have been implemented , replacing connection components @xmath102 by @xmath608 but not integrating over curves .",
    "curve integrations , on the other hand , provide additional terms which are non - local or , when a derivative expansion ( [ derexp ] ) is used , introduce higher spatial derivatives . keeping only higher powers of @xmath102 as in an expansion of the exponential , but ignoring spatial derivatives",
    "is not a consistent approximation : in strong curvature regimes , where holonomy effects should be significant , higher powers and higher derivatives of connection components both contribute to the same order of curvature .",
    "inverse - triad corrections , fortunately , are much better - behaved .",
    "first , the derivation of consistent deformations based on them is more complete , achieved in the same kind of models  cosmological perturbations @xcite , spherical symmetry @xcite , and @xmath246-dimensional models @xcite in which operator calculations can be performed  but with all crucial terms included .",
    "also inverse - triad corrections should come along with higher - derivative terms because they depend on fluxes , or integrated densitized triads .",
    "however , the non - derivative contribution is significant , as seen in section  [ s : effinv ] , and , unlike derivative terms , depends on parameters unrelated to curvature components .",
    "moreover , additional derivative terms are included by the counterterms of @xcite , while no connection - derivative counterterms have been used for holonomy corrections in @xcite .",
    "inverse - triad corrections are therefore more reliable than holonomy corrections at the present stage of developments in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "inverse - triad corrections are also more interesting from an observational perspective .",
    "because they do not directly refer to the curvature scale but rather to the discrete quantum - gravity scale related to the planck length , there is no a - priori reason why they should be small at low curvature .",
    "they can play a role in standard cosmological scenarios , for instance during inflation .",
    "indeed , in such a combined scenario , the window allowed for inverse - triad effects is much smaller than the one for curvature or holonomy modifications . for inverse - triad corrections ,",
    "a parameter range of about four orders of magnitude is consistent with observations @xcite , while curvature corrections have an allowed range of about ten orders of magnitude , one compared to the ratio of densities in observationally accessible regimes to the planck density .",
    "there are also indications of interesting and characteristic effects in non - gaussianity @xcite , although the required equations of motion second order in inhomogeneity still have to be made consistent . by inverse - triad effects",
    ", loop quantum gravity becomes falsifiable .    for a more detailed review of phenomenological implications ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "any quantum system can be evaluated consistently and reliably only when all possible quantum effects and the relevant degrees of freedom are taken into account . for quantum cosmology",
    ", this means that one must go beyond the traditional minisuperspace models and find consistent extensions to inhomogeneity .",
    "quantum - representation issues then become much more involved , but can be handled for instance with methods of loop quantum gravity . in this",
    "canonical setting , a large set of effective techniques , described in the main part of this review , is now available .",
    "these methods allow one to forgo ad - hoc assumptions , to implement full ( but possibly deformed ) space - time covariance , and to derive a complete phenomenological setting in which all relevant quantum effects are included .",
    "unlike in traditional canonical quantizations and derivations of wave functions , there do not appear to be major obstacles on the way toward systematic comparisons with observations .",
    "quantum cosmology is therefore empirically testable .    concretely working out all terms and studying",
    "the necessary parameterizations of quantization and state ambiguities still remains to be completed .",
    "even in isotropic models beyond the harmonic one , not much is known about the evolution of generic quantum states and the robustness of singularity avoidance ( see sections  [ s : states ] and [ s : qbr ] ) .",
    "control on inhomogeneous modes , necessary for most physical questions in cosmology and an understanding of quantum space - time , remains poor in strong quantum regimes , suffering from quantization ambiguities and the difficult anomaly problem ( see sections  [ s : cova ] and [ s : qgst ] ) .",
    "effective techniques , especially effective constraints , have relieved some of the pressure caused by the failure of traditional methods to address these problems , but they have not been evaluated in sufficient detail to provide a reliable view on planckian stages in cosmology .",
    "further in - depth investigations are required to change this situation and to provide a complete and reliable phenomenology of quantum cosmology .",
