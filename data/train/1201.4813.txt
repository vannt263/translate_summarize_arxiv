    "since von neumann algebras are rich in projections , they offer a nice representation of quantum _ events _ : projections of a von neumann algebra can be interpreted as 0 - 1valued observables where the expectation value of a projection is the probability of the event that the observable takes on the value 1 in the given quantum state .    two commuting events @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( represented as projections ) are said to be _ correlating _ in a state @xmath28 if @xmath33 .",

    "the above definition , however , is too specific since ( i ) it allows only for causes with a _ positive _ impact on their effects and ( ii ) it excludes the possibility of a _ set _ of cooperating common causes .",
    "hence we need to generalize the definition of the common cause in the following manner :    [ ccs ] a partition @xmath41 in @xmath35 is said to be the _ common cause system _ of the correlation between events @xmath4 and @xmath5 if the following screening - off condition holds for all @xmath42 : @xmath43 where the cardinality @xmath44 of @xmath45 is said to be the _ size _ of the common cause system . a common cause system of size @xmath46",
    "is called a common cause ( without the adjective reichenbachian , indicating that the inequalities ( [ cc3])-([cc4 ] ) are not required ) .    as a next step ,",
    "the notion of the common cause system is generalized to the quantum case : first , one replaces the classical probability measure space @xmath34 by the non - classical probability measure space @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the ( non - distributive ) lattice of projections ( events ) and @xmath28 is a state of a von neumann algebra @xmath49 .",

    "first , in case of a commuting common cause system @xmath63 can be replaced by @xmath28 in ( [ ncqccs1 ] ) since @xmath73 .",
    "second , using the decompositions of the unit , @xmath74 , ( [ ncqccs1 ] ) can be rewritten in an equivalent form : @xmath75 one can even allow here the case @xmath76 since then both sides of ( [ ncqccsrew ] ) are zero . finally , it is obvious from ( [ ncqccsrew ] ) that if @xmath77 with @xmath78 or @xmath79 for all @xmath42 then @xmath41 serves as a ( commuting ) common cause system of the given correlation independently of the chosen state @xmath28 .",
    "these solutions are called _ trivial common cause systems_. in case of common cause , @xmath72 , triviality means that @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "attached to the definition of the common cause ( system ) , reichenbach s common cause principle ( ccp ) is the following hypothesis : _ if there is a correlation between two events and there is no direct causal ( or logical ) connection between the correlating events then there exists a common cause of the correlation . _ the ccp in its present form ,",
    "however , does _ not _ refer to the spatiotemporal localization of the common cause ( system ) . since in a local quantum theory",
    "all local events are supported in a well - defined spacetime region , the ccp needs some tailoring to make it fit well to the local quantum field theoretical setting . to address this point ,",
    "one has to specify the localization of the possible common causes of the correlations .",

    "we summarize the results concerning the commutative ccps . in section 3",
    "we first motivate why commutativity is a physically unjustifiable requirement for common cause systems in local quantum theories and why it should be given up .",
    "then our main theorem will be proven stating that the _ noncommutative weak ccp _ holds in algebraic quantum field theory with locally finite degrees of freedom .",
    "section 4 concludes the paper .",
    "the question whether the commutative common cause principles are valid in a poincar covariant local quantum theory in the von neumann algebraic setting was first raised by rdei ( 1997 , 1998 ) . as an answer to this question , rdei and summers ( 2002 , 2007 )",
    "have shown that the commutative weak ccp is valid in algebraic quantum field theory with locally infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "namely , in the von neumann setting they proved that for every locally normal and faithful state and for every superluminally correlating pair of projections there exists a weak common cause , that is a common cause system of size 2 , in the weak past of the correlating projections . they have also shown ( rdei and summers , 2002 , p 352 ) that the localization of the common cause can not be restricted to @xmath95 or @xmath96 .    concerning the commutative ( strong ) ccp less",
    "if one also admits projections localized only in _ _ un__bounded regions then the strong ccp is known to be false : von neumann algebras pertaining to complementary wedges contain correlated projections but the strong past of such wedges is empty ( see summers and werner , 1988 and summers , 1990 ) .",
    "however , restricting ourselves to _ local _ algebras the situation is not clear .",
    "we are of the opinion that one can not decide on the validity of the ( strong ) ccp without an explicit reference to the dynamics since there is no bounded region @xmath88 in @xmath97 ( hence neither in @xmath98 ) for which isotony would ensure that @xmath99 . but dynamics relates the local algebras since @xmath100 can be fulfilled for certain @xmath101 and for certain time translation by @xmath102 .",
    "coming back to the proof of rdei and summers , the proof had a crucial premise , namely that the algebras in question are _ von neumann algebras of type iii_. although these algebras arise in a natural way in the context of poincar covariant theories other local quantum theories apply von neumann algebras of other type . for example",
    ", theories with locally finite degrees of freedom are based on finite dimensional ( type i ) local von neumann algebras .",
    "this raised the question whether the commutative weak ccp is valid in other local quantum theories . to address the problem hofer - szab and vecsernys ( 2012 )",

    "it turned out that the commutative weak ccp is _ not valid _ in the local quantum ising model and it can not be valid either in theories with locally finite degrees of freedom in general .",
    "since this model , which is a prototype of local uhf - type quantum theories , will play a role in our theorem proven in the next section , we introduce it here . first",

    "the set of half - integers can be interpreted as the space coordinates of the center @xmath104 and @xmath105 of minimal double cones @xmath106 of unit diameter on a thickened cauchy surface in two dimensional minkowski space @xmath107 ( see fig .",

    "what is more , any two local algebras with spacelike separated supports @xmath154 are embedded in simple local algebras with spacelike separated supports contained in the weak future / past @xmath155 of @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "local primitive causality implies that for any triple @xmath158 with @xmath159 the algebras obey @xmath160 .",
    "based on this @xmath161-covariant local quantum ising model hofer - szab and vecsernys ( 2012 ) proved the following proposition :    [ failwccp ] a local uhf - type quantum theory @xmath128 in @xmath113 does _ not _ satisfy the commutative weak ccp , in general .",
    "that is there exist nonzero projections @xmath162 and @xmath163 localized in two spacelike separated double cones @xmath164 and a faithful state on @xmath16 establishing a correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that there exists no nontrivial common cause system of the correlation localized in @xmath165 .",
    "hence , in contrast with local quantum theories having locally _ infinite _ degrees of freedom , the commutative weak ccp is _ not _ valid in general in models having locally _ finite _ degrees of freedom .",
    "obviously , the weak ccp is weaker then the ( strong ) ccp , hence the proposition above falsified the other two commutative ccps as well .",
    "as it was argued at the end of ( hofer - szab and vecsernys 2012 ) , one can react to this fact in two different ways .",
    "on the one hand , one may regard a discrete model as an approximation of a  more detailed ",
    "( discrete or continuous ) model .",
    "then the failure of commutative ccps is explained by the fact that the approximate model does not contain all the observables ; the common cause remains burried beyond the coarse description of the physical situation in question .",
    "only a refined extended model could reveal the hidden common causes .",
    "the other strategy , however , is to accept the discrete model as a self - contained physical model describing a specific physical phenomenon and to endorse the consequence of proposition [ failwccp ] as to the commutative ccp can not be a universally valid principle in local quantum theories . but",
    "this immediately raises the following question : what is the situation if we abandon commutativity between the common cause ( system ) and the correlating events ?",
    "are the noncommutative ccps valid in aqft ?    in ( hofer - szab and vecsernys 2012 )",
    "there have been some indications that replacing commuting common causes by noncommuting ones can help to regain the ccp : for the same state falsifying the commutative weak ccp a noncommuting common cause could be given ( located in the common past of the correlating events ) . in the next section we will show that this specific example is indeed the sign of a more general fact , namely the validity of the noncommutative weak ccp .",
    "commutativity has a well - specified role in quantum theories .",
    "observables should commute to be simultaneously measurable in quantum mechanics ; commutativity of observables with spacelike separated supports is one of the axioms of local quantum theories .",
    "however , as the possible causal time evolutions ( [ causal_automorph1])-([causal_automorph2 ] ) in the local quantum ising model show , the local observable @xmath166 does not commute even with its own unit time translates @xmath167 ( unless @xmath168 or @xmath169 ) .",
    "this happens already in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "let us consider the quantum harmonic oscillator given by the hamiltonian @xmath170 @xmath171 acting on the hilbert space @xmath172 of square integrable functions on the real line @xmath173 .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath174 of @xmath170 are @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the hermite polynomial @xmath177 the corresponding energy eigenvalues are @xmath178 .",
    "the unitary time evolution operator @xmath179 is diagonal in the basis @xmath180 with entries @xmath181 . using the recursion relation @xmath182 for the hermite polynomials",
    ", it is easy to see that the time evolved position operator @xmath183 does not commute with @xmath184 for generic @xmath102 , i.e for @xmath185 . for example , in the ground state @xmath186 \\ , \\psi_0   & = & ( e^{i(e_0-e_1)t}-e^{i(e_1-e_2)t})\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\psi_2      + ( e^{i(e_0-e_1)t}-e^{i(e_1-e_0)t})\\frac{1}{2}\\psi_0\\nonumber\\\\   & = & -i\\sin{(\\hbar\\omega t)}\\psi_0 \\not\\equiv 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , if an observable @xmath4 is not a conserved quantity , that is @xmath187 , then the commutator @xmath188\\not= 0 $ ] in general .",
    "so why should the commutators @xmath189 $ ] and @xmath190 $ ] vanish for the events @xmath0 and for their common cause @xmath3 supported in their ( weak / common / strong ) past ?",
    "we think that commuting common causes are only unnecessary reminiscense of their classical formulation . due to their relative spacetime localization , that is due to the time delay between the correlating events and the common cause , it is also an unreasonable assumption .",
