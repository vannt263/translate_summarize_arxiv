    "the dominant opinion is that we already have both an excellent theory of gravitation  namely , einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , and an excellent theoretical framework for particle physics ",
    "namely , the standard model , which is based on quantum field theory ( qft ) . the important problem of making quantum theory and gr compatible together should then be solved essentially by going to a superstructure including the two former theories as particular and/or limiting cases , the candidates for that superstructure being searched in the wide range of string theory .",
    "this might prove to be the case in the future , but it must be admitted that string theories are very complex , being based on differential geometry on high - dimensional manifolds . even gr and qft",
    "separately are already very complex , to the point that the link between either theory and its experimentally confirmed predictions is not fully understood , being based on rather peculiar algorithms @xcite .",
    "therefore , apart from the main line of research , one can find some risky attempts , in which it is tried to take a quite different route .",
    "+ one such route is suggested by the existence of an alternative version/ interpretation of special relativity , which version was initiated by lorentz @xcite and poincar @xcite . according to this version , the `` relativistic '' effects , which essentially follow from the lorentz transformation , are all due to the `` true '' lorentz contraction of physical objects as they are moving through the `` ether '' or fundamental inertial frame @xcite .",
    "in fact it can be shown that both lorentz s space - contraction and larmor s time - dilation follow from the negative result of the michelson - morley experiment , under the assumption that light propagate in all directions with the same velocity @xmath0 with respect to a rigid reference frame , in which euclidean geometry applies @xcite . in this `` lorentz  poincar version of special relativity '' ,",
    "the time which is defined in an inertial frame by using the poincar - einstein clock synchronization is generally not the `` true time '' : only in the fundamental inertial frame does the poincar - einstein - synchronized time coincide with the true time @xcite .",
    "the lorentz ",
    "poincar version of special relativity has the same equations as the usual version initiated by einstein in his well - known june 1905 paper , and is observationally equivalent to the usual version @xcite .",
    "however , just because of this , the `` ether '' , which is still there in the former version , is indetectable . in particular , the true time of the lorentz ",
    "poincar version is not experimentally accessible .",
    "+ but , precisely , an essential assumption of the investigated alternative theory of gravitation @xcite is that the presence of a gravitational field breaks the lorentz symmetry , thus making the ether detectable @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this theory , the inertial time in the ether frame is a physically identifiable preferred time @xmath1 ( called the `` absolute time '' ) .",
    "it is accepted that the existence of a preferred space - time foliation could give a solution to extend quantum theory to the situation with gravitation @xcite .",
    "the very beginning of this program is the formulation of the free klein - gordon wave equation in a gravitational field , which is ambiguous in gr , but leads to a unique equation ( which is a preferred - frame one ) in the framework of the `` ether - theory '' @xcite .",
    "another motivation for trying a very alternative theory of gravitation is to solve some problems which are common to gr and to most extensions of it  namely , the existence of singularities ( there is indeed no singularity in the investigated theory , neither during gravitational collapse `` in free fall '' with spherical symmetry @xcite nor in homogeneous cosmological models @xcite ) , and the interpretation of the gauge condition ( there is no gauge condition in this scalar theory ) . +",
    "this theory gives the same predictions as gr for light rays @xcite and it unambiguously predicts that the cosmic expansion must be accelerated @xcite . as to celestial mechanics : since this theory predicts schwarzschild s motion for test particles in the static case with spherical symmetry @xcite , one a priori expects that it should improve celestial mechanics as compared with newton s theory , in the same way as gr .",
    "however , due to the existence of preferred - frame effects , one has to check this carefully .",
    "to this end , an `` asymptotic '' scheme of post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation has been built for a weakly self - gravitating system of extended bodies , that consists in associating a one - parameter family of systems with that given system : each system is defined by an initial - value problem @xcite .",
    "this is a correct way to obtain asymptotic expansions of the solution fields , with respect to the small weak - field parameter . for extended bodies in gr ,",
    "this has been done only with a very particular initial condition as to the space metric @xcite , and the obtained local pn equations have not been integrated in the volume of the bodies to get equations of motion of the mass centers .",
    "the latter has been done for the investigated scalar theory @xcite .",
    "the obtained equations of motion of the mass centers depend on the spin rates of the bodies and involve structure - dependent parameters  two natural features for a theory that integrates the mass - energy equivalence . in order to test the theory , these equations",
    "have been implemented @xcite in a code for numerical integration and parameter adjustment , that has been built by the author and tested @xcite with standard equations of motion .",
    "( for the moment , the spin rates of the main bodies of the solar system have been neglected . )",
    "it has thus been found that the difference with a standard ephemeris @xcite does not exceed 3  over the 20th century @xcite .",
    "one may expect to significantly improve the observational agreement by improving the numerical treatment and also by adjusting the equations , not on an ephemeris , but directly on observational data .",
    "indeed some correction factors of observational data are taken as free parameters in the adjustment of an ephemeris , hence the observations are not completely independent of the gravitational model . +",
    "thus the current situation as to the experimental test of this theory is encouraging .",
    "however , it is usually considered that a scalar theory should have problems with gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "( note that it is usually considered that a scalar theory should also have problems with gravitational effects on light rays @xcite , and that it is not the case for the present preferred - frame theory . )",
    "therefore , the aim of the present investigation was to examine gravitational radiation . before discussing the main line of that investigation",
    ", we shall present the theory .",
    "the theory considered is a _ bimetric theory _ : space - time is endowed with both a flat metric @xmath2 and a curved metric @xmath3 .",
    "the relation between the two metrics is fixed by just a scalar field @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this can be true only because this is a _ preferred - frame theory _ and the equations are written in the preferred reference frame @xmath5 ( `` ether '' ) .",
    "( the uniformity and rigidity being defined in terms of the flat metric @xmath2 ) , then one just has to add a constant vector @xmath6 to the unknowns . ]",
    "thus , space - time is the product @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the  space \" manifold , i.e. the set of the positions @xmath9 in the preferred reference frame @xmath5 , and most equations are merely space - covariant .",
    "the preferred time coordinate @xmath1 is the inertial time in the frame @xmath5 ( i.e. @xmath10 with @xmath0 the velocity of light , and where the coordinates @xmath11 are galilean for the metric @xmath2 , that is , @xmath12 with @xmath13 ) . in particular , the scalar field @xmath14 ( thus in coordinates @xmath15 bound to the frame @xmath5 and with @xmath16 ) determines the slowing down of real clocks in a gravitational field , as compared with an `` absolute clock '' that would measure the absolute time @xmath1 .",
    "this is the case for a clock that is fixed in the ether frame , and far enough from any massive body so that it is not affected by any gravitational field @xcite .",
    "+ the equation for the field @xmath4 is @xcite a _ nonlinear wave equation _ : @xmath17 with @xmath18 the usual laplace operator defined with the euclidean metric @xmath19 , which is the spatial part of the flat metric @xmath2 in the frame @xmath5 ; @xmath20 is newton s gravitation constant and @xmath21 is the mass - energy density in the ether frame , @xmath22 being the `` mass tensor '' , i.e. the energy - momentum tensor in mass units . in the most general case , applicable to a heterogeneous universe on a cosmological time - scale ,",
    "the gravitational field is not directly the field @xmath4 but instead the field of the `` ether pressure '' @xmath23 , and a different field equation applies @xcite . but this reduces to ( [ field ] ) if the time variation of the `` reference pressure '' @xmath24 is neglected @xcite , which should be the case except on a cosmological time - scale .",
    "the analysis of homogeneous cosmological models @xcite confirms that the variation of @xmath25 takes place over long time scales , of the order of @xmath26 years .",
    "motion of a _",
    "free test particle _ is defined by an extension of the special - relativistic form of newton s second law : + @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy of the test particle : for a mass particle , @xmath29 with @xmath30 the velocity - dependent inertial mass ( @xmath31 is the lorentz factor ) ; for a photon , @xmath32 with @xmath33 the frequency measured with real clocks affected by the gravitational slowing down and thus measuring the `` local time '' @xmath34 ( see eq .",

    "+ in the static case ( @xmath40 ) , the extension  ( [ newtonlaw ] ) of newton s second law ( thus three scalar equations ) implies that free test particles follow the geodesic lines of metric @xmath3 ( thus four scalar equations : the time component of the geodesic equation is equivalent to the energy equation valid for a test particle in a static field ) @xcite . in the static case with",
    "spherical symmetry , schwarzschild s exterior metric is obtained @xcite .",
    "+ the dynamical equation for a _ continuous medium _ ( fluid , electromagnetic field , ... ) is deduced from newton s second law as defined above for a test particle . indeed , for a _ dust _ , eq .",
    "( [ newtonlaw ] ) may be applied pointwise and implies @xcite : @xmath41 @xmath42 ( recall that @xmath43 is the ( curved ) space metric in the frame @xmath5 .",

    "the universality of gravity means that _ the same equation must hold true for any continuous medium_.      equation  ( [ continuum ] ) may be rewritten in terms of the _ flat _ metric @xmath2 , giving as the time component : @xmath44 ( valid in galilean coordinates for the flat metric ) @xcite . using the equation ( [ field ] ) for the scalar field @xmath4 , the r.h.s . of eq .",

    "the energy rate in a fixed domain @xmath46 , whose boundary @xmath47 is not crossed by any matter , is got by integrating the conservation equation , it is @xmath48 +",
    "in gr and other relativistic theories of gravitation , gravitational radiation is mostly studied with the `` weak - field approximation '' , which is essentially a standard linearization of the field equations .",
    "however , we are here in a domain where the accuracy of the observations ( of the timing of the pulses emitted by binary pulsars ) is very high , and so also is the precision of the comparison theory/ observation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable that the link between the equations of the theory and its numerical predictions should be obtained with the help of a well - defined approximation scheme .",
    "thus one would need to introduce an asymptotic framework , associating with the physical system of interest @xmath49 a family ( @xmath50 ) of gravitating systems ( @xmath51 is the small field - strength parameter ) .",
    "a such `` asymptotic scheme '' was previously developed for celestial mechanics ( see the fourth paragraph of the introduction here ) .",
    "as @xmath52 , the behaviour becomes newtonian .",
    "thus it is a _",
    "post - newtonian _ ( pn ) scheme . like the standard pn scheme @xcite , that `` asymptotic '' pn scheme leads to poisson equations with instantaneous propagation",
    ", therefore it does not fit in the present context , since the aim is to describe how the energy balance is affected by the propagation of gravitational waves at the finite velocity @xmath0 .",
    "+ what one would need is an asymptotic _ post - minkowskian _ ( pm ) scheme , i.e. , one leading to a _ wave equation _ for the gravitational field ( here the scalar @xmath4 ) . in gr , it has been proved that one - parameter families of solutions to the vacuum einstein equations generically exist , and that the successive coefficients of their taylor expansions with respect to the parameter do satisfy the successive equations of the pm approximation @xcite .",
    "however , in order to justify standard calculations based on equating the newtonian energy rate to the energy rate as given by the `` quadrupole formula of gr '' ( see e.g. refs . )",
    ", it is necessary that there is indeed matter which has the relevant quadrupole tensor .",
    "one possible approach that would provide a reasonable justification to such calculations would be to show that the same given self - gravitating system may be consistently envisaged both in well - defined pn and pm approximation schemes ; that the pm scheme ( as applied to the given system and thus also inside the bodies ) gives some calculable non - zero gravitational energy rate @xmath53 ; and that the pm scheme is more general than the pn scheme , so that it does make sense to state the equation @xmath54 this turns out to be feasible .",
    "we shall insist on the essential points of that approach ( the details of which shall be published elsewhere ) and shall skip the calculations .",

    "these equations ( [ pm_ic1])@xmath61 and ( [ pm_ic2])@xmath62 are exactly the same as in the pn scheme @xcite . , where @xmath71 is that used in ref . @xcite . ]",
    "the essential difference with the ( asymptotic ) pn scheme of the scalar theory @xcite is that , in the pm scheme , it is not _",
    "necessary _ that @xmath72 ( in the physical sense ) for the given system @xmath49 , because the velocity in the generic system @xmath50 of the family is order zero with respect to the parameter @xmath51 ( eq .  ( [ pm_ic3 ] ) )  whereas the velocity is order @xmath73 in the pn scheme @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the time derivative of the gravitational potential @xmath74 is order 1 in @xmath51 in the pm scheme ( eq .",
    "( [ pm_ic2])@xmath75 ) , whereas it is order 3/2 in the pn scheme @xcite .",
    "hence , the ( asymptotic ) pm scheme is just _",
    "more general _ than the corresponding pn scheme , in the sense that the given system @xmath49 will automatically be suitable for the pm scheme if it is for the pn one , and the converse is not true .",
    "( but the pm _ family _ ( @xmath50 ) is not `` more general '' than the corresponding pn family : it is just a different family of solutions . ) thus , @xmath53 can be used in the pn scheme .",
    "we assume that the initial - value problem @xmath76 , defined by eqs .",
    "( [ pm_ic1])([pm_ic3 ] ) , has generically a unique solution in some large - enough domain , and that the solution fields admit asymptotic expansions in powers of @xmath51 , which have necessarily the same dominant order in @xmath51 as the initial values .",
    "precisely , we need just the principal part in these expansions .",
    "after changing the mass and the time units , for system @xmath50 , to the new units @xmath77_\\lambda = \\lambda[\\mathrm{m}]$ ] and @xmath78_\\lambda = [ \\mathrm{t}]/\\sqrt{\\lambda}$ ] ( where @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] are the starting units ) , the small parameter @xmath51 becomes proportional to @xmath79 , and all fields : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath74 , @xmath80 , _ but the velocity _ , are order zero , whereas the velocity field @xmath81 is order @xmath0 .",
    "we may hence write : @xmath82 ( recall that @xmath21 is the source of the gravitational field , eq .  ( [ field ] ) ) .",
    "these expansions have primarily to be valid at fixed values of the relevant time and space variables . due to the fact that the velocity is order zero in the small parameter ( in fixed units ) for the pm family , the relevant time variable ( the `` dynamical time '' in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the true time @xmath1 ( as expressed in fixed units )  whereas the relevant time variable is @xmath83 for the pn family of systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the new ( varying ) units , in which the expansions have the convenient form ( [ expans_fields ] ) , and in which @xmath84 , the relevant time variable is @xmath85 . as a consequence ,",
    "the expansion of the field equation ( [ field ] ) leads , as we wished , to the wave equation for the 0pm potential @xmath86 : @xmath87  instead of the poisson equation which applies to the 0pn ( newtonian ) potential . as @xmath52 , the gravitational energy flux ( [ energyrate ] ) has a principal part @xmath88 : @xmath89 where @xmath86 is the relevant ( retarded ) solution of eq .",

    "however , @xmath96 disappears from the flux ( [ pm0_flux ] ) , due to the presence of the partial derivative @xmath97 . as to @xmath98 , it is in the _ limit _ flux just by @xmath99 .",
    "but @xmath100 from the 0pm conservation of the total momentum ( which is obtained when inserting the expansions ( [ expans_fields ] ) into the dynamical equation ( [ continuum ] ) ) .",
    "it follows that the limit as @xmath101 of the pm energy flux contains just quadrupole terms : @xmath102      as already mentioned , the fact that the pm scheme is more general than the pn scheme implies that it makes sense to use the energy rate @xmath53 in the pn scheme .",
    "let us try to expand on this point .",
    "the limit , as @xmath101 , of the principal part of the pm energy flux , is given by eq.([limit_flux2 ] ) , whereas , _ at the zero - order pn approximation _",

    "zero_. indeed , the principal part of the pn energy flux , @xmath103 , is just the newtonian energy flux .",

    "@xmath107 however , although the zero - order pn ( i.e. , newtonian ) energy @xmath108 is thus constant at this same zero - order pn approximation , it has no reason to remain so at the following , truly post - newtonian , approximations . indeed , as the order @xmath109 of the pn approximation increases ,",
    "the energy rate @xmath110 calculated at the @xmath111 pn approximation should become a better and better approximation of the exact energy rate @xmath112 , more precisely one should have @xmath113 moreover , the dominant part of @xmath110 should precisely be the rate of @xmath108 : if the pn expansions are uniform with respect to time , then , by summing the rates of the successive terms in the asymptotic expansion of the energy : @xmath114 one should obtain the asymptotic expansion of the energy rate : @xmath115 more exactly , when we write eq .",
    "( [ energy_rate_npn_sums ] ) , we are using the @xmath111 pn approximation and we must hence rewrite this equation as @xmath116 of course , just the same may be done with the pm scheme .",
    "what happens is that the first iterations of the _ pn _ scheme , in particular the very first one ( the newtonian approximation ) , give the simple prediction that the energy of the gravitating system is conserved , i.e. @xmath117 therefore , the exact energy rate is certainly very small , and one would like to calculate it by using the @xmath118 pn approximation , that gives the first non - zero result ( in gr , the standard pn scheme gives @xmath119 @xcite , the fractional number meaning merely that a taylor expansion in @xmath51 does not apply any more ) .",
    "but this is very complicated , hence one is led to admit that the first non - zero result given by the _",
    "pm _ approximation , and which turns out to correspond to the zero - order pm approximation ( eq .  ( [ limit_flux2 ] ) ) , is a good approximation to the exact result .",
    "the reason to believe so is that the pm approximation , in contrast to the pn one , does take into account naturally the phenomenon of gravitational radiation .",
    "we may summarize by admitting that , for some number @xmath65 ( may be @xmath119 ) : @xmath120      now we consider a binary system and we assume i ) that the two bodies are far enough , so that they do not tidally interact ; and ii ) that the radiative energy loss does not affect the spins . under these assumptions , the rates of the quadrupole tensor @xmath121 , which allow to approximate the gravitational radiative energy loss ( eq .",

    "if one wants to test a given theory of gravitation , then the `` timing model '' used to fit the pulse data should be consistently and entirely based on that theory .",

    "( [ binaryedotgr ] ) ) , while keeping the same order of magnitude for a given orbit and a given @xmath136 . in view of the foregoing sentence about the consistency of the timing model and the theory ,",
    "this does not prove that the scalar theory is not able to accurately fit the pulse data ( which is indeed the true test ) .",

    "a scalar bimetric theory with a preferred reference frame has been motivated and summarized . an asymptotic framework has been introduced for the `` post - minkowskian '' ( pm ) approximation outside _ and inside _ the bodies as well , by considering a family of initial - value problems for a perfect - fluid system ; this seems to be new and could be useful in other theories . in particular , it has been shown that this pm scheme is more general than the corresponding post - newtonian ( pn ) scheme and that , therefore , a simple and reasonable justification can be given for the procedure usually adopted in studies on gravitational radiation .",
    "that is , it is allowable to take the energy rate as given by the pm approximation and to say that it represents ( approximately ) the rate of the newtonian energy . using that pm scheme , the 0pm approximation of the energy rate for an isolated system has been calculated for the investigated scalar theory .",
