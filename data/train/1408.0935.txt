    "one of the most exciting discoveries in cosmology after hubble s discovery of expansion of universe is the accelerated expansion of the universe@xcite . in order to explain the acceleration",
    ", it becomes necessary to modify the existing theory of gravitation proposed by einstein , ie .",
    ", the general theory of relativity .",
    "it can be done in two ways , the first one is to modifying the energy - momentum part of the field equation .",
    "this necessitates the existence of an exotic component called dark energy .",
    "the cosmological constant is the simplest dark energy model . since the effect of dark energy",
    "can be felt only at large scales there are no experimental supports to it till now . the second approach to explain the observed acceleration of the universe is to modify the curvature dependent part of field equation .",
    "this results in extended theories of gravity .",
    "there are a number of extended theories of gravity in literature .",
    "f(r ) gravity , gauss - bonnet gravity , teleparallel gravity and new massive gravity are some examples of extended theories of gravity . among them , f(r ) gravity is simple and successful@xcite .    even though the f(r ) gravity is most simple and comparatively successful",
    ", we can not find out a unified f(r ) model which explains both galaxy rotation curves of different galaxies as well as the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "some f(r ) models like @xmath0 suffers the problem of ghosts .",
    "we must choose an f(r ) model that must be stable for different types of perturbations .",
    "the different studies towards the quantum gravity show that there must be terms of curvature invariants but there are no curvature invariants in general f(r ) theory@xcite .",
    "the action of f(r ) gravity is obtained by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath1 in the einstein - hilbert action by a general function of @xmath1 .",
    "varying the action thus obtained with respect to the metric we get the f(r ) field equation , it is a fourth order equation .",
    "comparing the field equation of general theory of relativity which is second order , the field equation of f(r ) gravity is more difficult to solve .",
    "static cylindrically symmetric interior solutions in f(r ) gravity is studied by sharif et al@xcite and godel solution is obtained by santos@xcite in f(r , t ) gravity .",
    "thermodynamics of evolving lorentzian wormholes is studied by saiedi@xcite . in this work",
    "we use a solution originally obtained by sebastiani et al@xcite .",
    "scattering of scalar field in this metric has been studied by the authors@xcite .",
    "the quasinormal modes are the characteristic sound of black hole , which was first pointed out by vishveshwara@xcite .",
    "chandrasekhar and detweller@xcite studied the quasinormal modes of schwarzschild black hole .",
    "since then there are a number of works appeared in this field . for",
    "a review on quasinormal modes please see the references@xcite and references therein .",
    "the study of quasinormal modes becomes relevant because it gives a direct way to detect black hole using the gravitational waves .",
    "there are a number of methods for evaluating quasinormal frequencies but the wkb method developed by schutz , will and iyer is the simplest@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the static spherically symmetric solution in f(r ) gravity in section 3 , we study the quasinormal modes of the extended black hole perturbed by electromagnetic field . in section 4",
    "we study the quasinormal modes of extended black hole using scalar perturbation for massive and massless cases .",
    "wkb approximation is discussed in section 5 and finally in section 6 conclusion of the present work is given .",
    "starting with the f(r ) action as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the determinant of the metric and @xmath4 is the general function of ricci scalar @xmath1 .",
    "we start with a static spherically symmetric solution.@xcite we take @xmath5 and this particular form of f(r ) is taken as it gives a valid black hole solution .",
    "we take this f(r ) as positive , where @xmath6 is an integration constant .",
    "this is chosen either as positive or zero and all terms in the radical are taken as positive .",
    "we write the static spherically symmetric solution as@xcite @xmath7 with constant @xmath8 , we get the solution as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 comparing with schwarzschild - de sitter solution , the @xmath6 term in the solution which is the coefficient of @xmath12 can represent the cosmological constant term . for in this case",
    "we choose @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we choose @xmath14 because we restrict our study to a space time which is asymptotically flat@xcite .",
    "we select @xmath15 as @xmath16 such that the metric should be positively related to the mass only in such cases we get the correct newtonian limit and @xmath17 is chosen as a length parameter .",
    "thus the extended metric in f(r ) gravity is given by@xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the black hole mass and @xmath17 is a length parameter of the metric .",
    "the black hole mass is related to the metric linearly and thus we assume a linear mass term with one length parameter .",
    "this length parameter can be adjusted to obtain an effective rotation curves of galaxies and gravitational lensing .",
    "f(r ) is chosen as above because only this form of f(r ) will give a static spherically symmetric black hole solution .",
    "f(r ) models with @xmath0 , @xmath20 etc.@xcite have been studied but they do not possess black hole solution .",

    "we can evaluate quasinormal modes of electromagnetic perturbation .",
    "the electromagnetic quasinormal modes are given in table . 1",
    "in this section , we study the quasinormal modes of the extended black hole in f(r ) gravity perturbed by scalar fields .",
    "the metric is given by eq.(5 ) .",
    "since we are considering the scalar perturbation , we can use the klein gordon equation .",
    "we consider here both the massless and massive scalar field .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for a massive scalar field is , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mass of the scalar field . in order to separate the wave function into radial , temporal , and angular parts , we write @xmath37 as @xmath38 substituting eq .",

( 2 ) .",
    "using the third order wkb approximation method developed by schutz and will@xcite and finally modified by iyer and will@xcite , we can obtain the frequency of the quasinormal mode in general as , @xmath46-i(n+\\frac{1}{2})(-2v_{0}'')^{\\frac{1}{2}}(1+\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath47,\\ ] ] and @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , and @xmath50    the potentials given in eq .",

    "we have plotted the data in fig.(1 ) , for electromagnetic field case and from this figure we can see that the real part of quasinormal frequencies decreases with increasing mode number @xmath51 for a given angular momentum quantum number @xmath25 .",
    "the fig.(2 ) and fig.(3 ) show scalar field perturbations for massless and massive field respectively . in fig.(1 )",
