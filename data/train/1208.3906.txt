    "our understanding of the two - body problem in general relativity has advanced substantially in the past decade . besides the celebrated breakthroughs in numerical relativity @xcite which have opened the field of binary phenomenology in general relativity ,",
    "there has been great progress in understanding the extreme mass - ratio limit of this problem , when one member of the binary is much smaller than the other .",
    "this limit is of great interest in describing astrophysical extreme mass - ratio binaries ( a particularly interesting source for space - based gravitational - wave measurements ) @xcite , and as a limiting form of the more generic two - body problem @xcite .",

    "the black hole s spacetime is slightly deformed",
    ". this deformation changes the trajectory that the small body follows , pushing it away from the background spacetime s geodesic .",
    "it is useful to regard the change to the trajectory as arising from a self force which modifies the geodesic equations typically used to describe black hole orbits .",
    "conceptually , it is useful to split the self force into two pieces : a time - symmetric _ conservative _ piece , and a time - asymmetric _ dissipative _ piece . on average",
    ", the impact of the conservative contribution is to shift orbital frequencies away from their geodesic values .",
    "the dissipative self force is equivalent , on average , to a slow evolution of the otherwise conserved constants ( e.g. , the orbital energy and angular momentum ) which characterize geodesic orbits .",
    "it makes the largest contribution to an orbit s phase evolution .",
    "the conservative piece makes a smaller ( though still significant ) contribution which accumulates secularly over many orbits @xcite .",
    "recent work by flanagan and hinderer @xcite ( hereafter fh ) using a post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to the self force together with fully relativistic orbital dynamics has shown that a small body s self interaction becomes particularly important near _",
    "resonances_. the background geodesic motion can be characterized by three orbital frequencies with respect to boyer - lindquist time : a radial frequency @xmath7 , a polar frequency @xmath8 , and an axial frequency @xmath9 . in the weak - field ( large separation )",
    "limit , these three frequencies asymptote to the newtonian kepler frequency . in the strong field",
    ", these frequencies can differ significantly , with @xmath7 always the smallest frequency ( the relative magnitude of @xmath8 and @xmath10 depends on the sign of the orbit s axial angular momentum ) .",
    "resonant orbits are ones for which the radial and angular motions become commensurate : @xmath11 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are small integers with no common factors . on such orbits , components of the self interaction which normally `` average away ''",
    "when examined over a full orbital period instead combine coherently , substantially changing their impact on the system s evolution .    for the purpose of our background discussion , it is useful to include more details from fh s analysis of how resonant effects arise . consider a body of mass @xmath12 moving on a bound trajectory near a kerr black hole of mass @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "fh note that one can describe the motion of this body using action - angle variables and correctly accounting for how the integrals which parameterize geodesic orbits evolve due to the self force .",

    "( [ eq : eom1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) simply describe geodesics of kerr black holes : the integrals of the motion are constant , and each angle variable evolves according to its associated frequency . the leading adiabatic dissipative correction to this motion",
    "can be found by dropping the forcing term @xmath26 and replacing @xmath27 by @xmath29 , the average of this forcing term over the 2-torus parameterized by @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite . to compute this torus - averaged self force , it is sufficient to use the radiative approximation @xcite , which includes only the radiative contributions to the self interaction and neglects conservative contributions . for generic ( non - resonant ) orbits ,",
    "this torus average coincides with an infinite time average , and the averaged quantities @xmath32 are just the time - averaged fluxes of energy , angular momentum and carter constant . in recent years",
    "such time - averaged fluxes have been computed numerically using the frequency domain teukolsky equation @xcite .",
    "these fluxes can be used to compute leading - order , adiabatic inspirals .",
    "the conservative contributions influence the motion only beyond the leading adiabatic order @xcite .      now consider going beyond the leading adiabatic order .",
    "important post - adiabatic effects can be found by continuing to neglect @xmath26 , but now integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom2 ] ) using @xmath27 rather than its averaged variant .",
    "fh show that for `` most '' orbits , @xmath27 is given by @xmath29 plus a rapidly oscillating contribution . over the timescales associated with inspiral ,",
    "this rapidly oscillating piece averages away and has little effect .",
    "the effect of the forcing term @xmath27 is dominated by @xmath29 for all non - resonant orbits .    for resonant orbits ,",
    "this averaging fails : contributions beyond @xmath29 are _ not _ rapidly oscillating , and can significantly modify how the integrals of motion evolve during an inspiral .",
    "a given binary is very likely to evolve through several low - order resonances en route to the final merger of the smaller body with the large black hole @xcite",
    ". a complete quantitative understanding of these resonant effects will thus be quite important for making accurate inspiral models .",
    "prior to fh s analysis , several other papers argued that such resonances may play an important role in the radiative evolution of binary systems @xcite ( albeit without quantifying the detailed impact they can have ) , or else because of other effects which resonances have on the evolution of a dynamical system @xcite .",
    "orbits in which @xmath33 take on a small - integer ratio have been studied in great detail by grossman , levin , and perez - giz @xcite , who called them `` periodic '' orbits and provided a fairly simple scheme for classifying their features . following ref .",
    "@xcite ( as well as more recent work by grossman , levin , and perez - giz @xcite ) , we will call them `` resonant '' orbits , reflecting the fact that our main interest is in understanding how their periodic structure impacts the self interaction .",
    "grossman , levin and perez - giz have more recently argued for the utility of using resonant orbits as sample points in numerical computations of leading order , adiabatic inspirals : evaluating fluxes at resonant orbits may enable a speedup of flux computations @xcite , more efficiently covering the parameter space of generic orbits .",
    "although their goals are rather different from ours here , many of their techniques and results substantially overlap with ours ( modulo minor differences in notation ) .",
    "we highlight the overlap at appropriate points in this paper .    as a binary evolves through a resonance , its self interaction and thus its evolution",
    "are modified compared to what we would expect if the resonance were not taken into account .",
    "the details of how the self interaction is modified depend on the relative phase of the radial and angular motions as the orbit passes through resonance .",
    "because of this , _ resonances enhance the dependence of a binary s orbital evolution on initial conditions .",
    "_ let the phase variable @xmath34 define the value of the orbit s @xmath2 angle at the moment it reaches periapsis ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : generalgeod ] for more details ) . on resonance ,",
    "two orbits which have the same energy @xmath19 , the same axial angular momentum @xmath20 , and the same carter constant @xmath21 will evolve differently if they have different values of @xmath34 .",
    "fh estimate @xcite that the shift to the orbital phase induced by these resonances can be several tens to @xmath35 radians for mass ratios @xmath36 ( as compared to an analysis which neglects the resonances ) .",
    "that there is such a large shift , and that this shift may depend on initial conditions , is potentially worrisome .",
    "resonances could significantly complicate our ability to construct models for measuring the waves from extreme mass - ratio inspirals . on the other hand , the detailed behavior of a system as it evolves through resonances may offer an opportunity to study an interesting aspect of strong - field gravity , providing a new handle for strong - gravity phenomenology .",
    "analytic studies of the effect of the passage through resonance can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the `` several tens to @xmath35 radians '' estimate by fh is based on applying pn self force estimates to strong - field orbits , a regime where pn approximations are generally inaccurate .",
    "it is thus of great interest to estimate the impact of orbital resonances using strong - field methods .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to take a first step in this direction .",
    "our goal is to generalize our computational techniques in order to treat resonances correctly .",
    "a key point is that the flux - balancing technique which can be used to approximate inspiral ( as described in the final paragraph of sec .",
    "[ sec : synopsis ] ) is based on the adiabatic approximation .",
    "this approximation temporarily breaks down during a resonance .",
    "therefore , to treat resonances , one must use the orbital equations of motion ( [ eq : eom1 ] )  ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) to track the evolution of all the orbital degrees of freedom on short timescales .",
    "flux balancing instead just tracks the evolution of the conserved quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 on long timescales .",
    "in addition one must use the full , oscillatory self - force driving term @xmath27 , and not just its averaged version .",
    "as is well known , computation of the full self force is extremely difficult , largely because it requires regularization of the self field @xcite .",
    "fortunately , only the dissipative piece of the self force should contribute to leading order resonance effects . as argued in fh",
    ", there is some evidence suggesting that geodesic motion perturbed by the conservative piece of the self force is an integrable dynamical system , and resonances do not occur in such systems .",
    "thus , if the integrability conjecture of fh is true , only the dissipative self force needs to be computed .",
    "this constitutes a great simplification , since the well - known difficulties of self - force computations apply only to the conservative piece ; the dissipative piece is relatively straightforward to compute .",
    "techniques for doing so with scalar fields were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and generalizing to the gravitational dissipative self force is not terribly difficult @xcite .",
    "while these references focused on the _ averaged _ self force , it is straightforward to generalize the analysis to obtain the full dissipative self force .",
    "it is thus feasible to perform numerical compututations of orbital evolutions through resonances using the full dissipative self force , without any orbit averaging .",
    "our eventual goal is to extend our black hole perturbation theory codes to do just this , and to evaluate how the dissipative self force behaves as a system evolves through resonance .",
    "work in this vein is in progress , and will be presented in future work @xcite .    in this paper , we take a first step in this direction .",
    "we focus here on computation of time - averaged fluxes of the integrals of the motion , and in particular on how these quantities differ between resonant and non - resonant orbits .",
    "these quantities correspond to the fluxes that one would measure at infinity ( and at the black hole horizon ) if one turned off radation reaction effects ; upon averaging over long times , they are equal to the rate at which the dissipative self force evolves these constants .",
    "we emphasize that these quantities are not sufficient to allow computation of orbital evolutions .",
    "however , they provide insight into the characteristic features of the radiation emitted by resonant orbits .",
    "we find that fluxes from resonant orbits generically differ from those from nearby , non - resonant orbits .",
    "] , and in addition vary depending on the relative phase of the radial and angular motions .",
    "the magnitude of this variation is closely related to the `` kick '' that is imparted to the orbit s constants as it evolves through a resonance ( cf .  fig .  1 of fh ) .",
    "as such , characterizing on - resonance fluxes is a useful and natural first step in the process of modifying existing flux - based codes to compute the full dissipative self force .",
    "we explore numerically the magnitude of the difference between the resonant and non - resonant cases , and the dependence on the orbital phase . for specific modes , the fluxes can vary by large factors ( although variations of order unity are more typical ) . for the net fluxes obtained by summing over all modes , variations are typically of order a percent or less .",

    "much of this material has been presented elsewhere , so we leave out most details , pointing the reader to appropriate references .",

    "[ sec : resi ] and [ sec : resii ] .",
    "we describe two complementary approaches to computing fluxes on resonance . although formally equivalent ( as we prove in appendix [ app : equivalence ] ) , their implementation is quite different . having both methods at hand proved useful to us in our numerical study .",
    "one aspect of the on - resonance computation ( the evolution of carter s constant @xmath21 ) is sufficiently complicated that all details of this calculation are given in appendix [ app : qdot ] . our analytic results for fluxes of energy and angular momentum on resonance agree with those obtained by grossman , levin and perez - giz ( compare especially secs .",

    "we begin by examining how fluxes from individual modes ( i.e. , harmonics of the orbital frequencies ) behave as a function of the offset phase of the radial and angular motions , which we denote @xmath34 .",
    "we show that the amplitude of a given mode , and hence the rates of change of conserved quantities associated with that mode , can vary significantly with @xmath34 .",
    "for example , the flux of energy from an orbit can vary by factors of order unity as @xmath34 varies from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the rate of change of the orbit s carter constant can even change sign as @xmath34 varies . the total flux from a given orbit",
    "is given , however , by adding fluxes from many modes .",
    "when many modes are combined , much of the variation washes away ; we find variations of a fraction of a percent in most quantities after summation .",
    "the amount of this residual variation seems to depend most strongly upon the geometry of the orbit s @xmath39 motion on resonance , in particular the topology of the trace in the @xmath39 plane .",
    "orbits whose motion in @xmath39 have a simple topology with few trajectory crossings in the plane ( e.g. , the @xmath40 resonance ) tend to have relatively large variation in the integrals of motion ; orbits whose motion has a more complicated topology with many trajectory crossings show much less variation ( e.g. , the @xmath41 resonance ) .",
    "we argue that this can be explained in terms of how the orbital motion tends ( or fails ) to average away variations in the source - term to the teukolsky equation .    as emphasized in sec .",
    "[ sec : our_paper ] , understanding these fluxes exactly on resonance is only the first step in building a complete strong - field understanding of how resonances impact inspirals .",

    "second , there are two qualitatively different types of resonances that can occur in systems of this kind : a simple linear resonance in which the kicks depend sinusoidally on the phase parameter @xmath34 ( cf .",
    "the final equation of fh ) , and a nonlinear variant in which the dynamics is rather more complicated . for the nonlinear scenario , it is possible to have a `` sustained resonance '' in which the system becomes trapped near the resonance for an extended period of time @xcite .",
    "our numerical results show that @xmath303 at least over all of the parameter space we have surveyed so far , which indicates that the resonances are always of the simple , linear kind .",
    "this agrees with post - newtonian analyses @xcite , as well as recent work by van de meent @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     some interesting trends are apparent from these tables .",
    "first , notice that in all cases the down - horizon variation is quite a bit larger than than the variation in the quantities to infinity .",
    "however , in all cases , the magnitude of the down - horizon fluxes is substantially smaller than the magnitude to infinity .",
    "the total variations are thus dominated by the fluxes to infinity , consistent with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edottot31 ] .",
    "second , notice that the largest variations are seen in either the 2:1 or 3:2 resonances ( always the 3:2 resonance for orbits with @xmath283 , but either 3:2 or 2:1 depending on which quantity we examine for the orbits with @xmath255 ) .",
    "the variations are consistently smallest for the 4:3 resonance .",
    "this behavior correlates with the shape that a resonant orbit traces in the @xmath39 plane .",
    "figure [ fig : compareres ] shows these orbital tracks for the four orbits presented in table [ tab : variations_e0.7_thm20 ] . for simplicity",
    ", we only show tracks for @xmath304 .",
    "the contrasting shapes of the 2:1 and 3:2 orbits on one hand , and of the 4:3 orbit on the other , are particularly noteworthy .",
    "the 4:3 resonant orbit ( bottom right ) traces a rather complicated lissajous figure which comes `` close to '' many of the @xmath39 points which are accessible given @xmath72 .",
    "this complicated trajectory samples much of the accessible domain in @xmath3 and @xmath2 . appealing to the constrained integral method of computing @xmath211 ( cf .",
    "[ sec : resii ] ) , we can say that the motion effectively averages out the variations in the integrand by passing close to so many accessible points .",
    "by contrast , the trajectory for the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances ( top right and bottom left ) are much simpler . these trajectories do not come as close to so many points in their allowed domain , and so do not average the variations in their integrands as effectively .",
    "the trajectory for the 3:1 ( top left ) resonance is similar to that for the 2:1 case , but with an additional angular oscillation at small radius .",
    "this extra oscillation enhances the averaging as the orbit moves through a particularly strong - field part of its domain .",
    "not too surprisingly , the flux variation in this case is generally intermediate to the others .    beyond the fact that orbits with simple shapes in the @xmath39 plane tend to show stronger resonances than orbits with more complicated shapes , we do not as yet see strong evidence of any trend which would allow us to predict which resonances will tend to be `` strong '' ( i.e. , exhibit large variation in orbital parameter evolution ) and which `` weak . ''",
    "consider for example the rate of change of orbital energy , @xmath305 .",
    "as we go from high inclination to shallow and from high eccentricity to low , we see that @xmath305 goes from large to small : it takes the value @xmath306 for high eccentricity , high inclination ( table [ tab : variations_e0.7_thm20 ] ) ; @xmath307 and @xmath308 for the mixed cases ( tables [ tab : variations_e0.7_thm70 ] and [ tab : variations_e0.3_thm20 ] ) ; and the value @xmath309 for the case of small eccentricity , shallow inclination ( table [ tab : variations_e0.3_thm70 ] ) .",
    "this appears to suggest , at least roughly , that the strength of the resonance is correlated with the degree of radial and angular motion .",
    "however , no such pattern is seen when we examine @xmath310 and @xmath311 . for @xmath20 , the high eccentricity",
    ", high inclination case again produces the largest variation ( @xmath312 , in the 3:2 resonance of table [ tab : variations_e0.7_thm20 ] ) .",
    "however , the _ low _ eccentricity , _ low _ inclination case produces the second largest variation ( @xmath313 , in the 3:2 resonance of table [ tab : variations_e0.3_thm70 ] ) .",
    "these values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 likewise produce the largest and second - largest variations in the carter constant ( albeit in different resonances ) .",
    "we do not yet have a compelling way to explain these trends ( or lack of trends ) in the resonances strength , so we leave this mystery to future work .",
    "in this analysis , using a teukolsky - equation - based formalism good for exploring radiation produced by strong - field orbits , we have confirmed the picture that on resonance the gravitational - wave driven evolution of a binary can depend strongly on the relative phase of radial and angular motions . a binary in which this relative phase has the value @xmath314",
    "as the system enters resonance may evolve quite differently from an otherwise identical system in which this phase is @xmath315 entering resonance . a typical extreme mass - ratio binary",
    "can be expected to pass through several orbital resonances en route to its final coalescence . that their evolution through each resonance depends strongly on an `` accidental '' phase parameter has the potential to complicate schemes for measuring gravitational waves from these binaries .",
    "we find that the degree of variation depends strongly upon the topology of the orbital trajectory in the @xmath39 plane plane .",
    "however , its geometry is strongly correlated to its topology , which is an invariant property of a resonant orbit s frequencies @xcite . as such , the topology is a valuable way to characterize this aspect of its resonant behavior . ] . of the cases we have studied in detail ,",
    "the orbital plane trajectory of resonances like @xmath40 have a simple topology .",
    "this trajectory does not cross itself very often , and does not come close to many points in the plane .",
    "such resonances do not effectively average out the behavior of the source to the wave equation . as such ,",
    "if the source varies significantly over an orbit , there can be a strong residue of this variation in the associated radiation .",
    "by contrast , the trajectory of resonances like @xmath316 has a more complicated topology , crossing itself many times , and more completely `` covering '' the plane . in these cases ,",
    "the orbit comes `` close to '' many of the allowed points in the @xmath39 plane , which quite effectively averages out the source s behavior .",
    "although instructive and a nice validation of our ability to examine resonances , these results are not enough to truly assess the importance that resonances have in a strong field analysis . we must be able to analyze a system as it evolves through a resonance , and thereby integrate the full `` kicks '' in the integrals of motion @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 imparted to the system as it passes through resonance .",
    "a first step in this direction has been taken by van de meent @xcite , who examines the likelihood that resonances can `` trap '' an orbit , leading to long - lived resonant waves .",
    "part of van de meent s analysis is adescription of the system s evolution as motion through a one - dimensional effective potential .",
    "this approach is likely to be useful for more general analysis of resonant evolution .    for our planned work",
    ", we have begun expanding our teukolsky code to compute , in the frequency domain , the instantaneous components of the dissipative or radiative piece of the self force .",
    "our formulation is based in part on the discussion of refs .",
