    "in microrheology , the mechanical properties of a substance are studied by monitoring the trajectories of single particles @xcite .",
    "thereby , one distinguishes between two different modes : passive microrheology , in which the equilibrium properties of the material are probed by studying the motion of a single particle @xcite , and active microrheology , in which a single particle is subjected to an external drive . in the latter case ,",
    "the response to strong external perturbations is of particular interest since it allows one to study the properties of the system in an out - of - equilibrium situation @xcite .",
    "recently , this method has been applied to study the properties of glass - forming systems in both , experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite . for these systems ,",
    "several remarkable effects have been observed like a nonlinear thinning of supercooled liquids @xcite , local melting of glassy samples  @xcite and intermittent superdiffusivity in the supercooled regime  @xcite . because of this , there is recently a field of vivid research to provide a theoretical description of the out - of - equilibrium properties @xcite , mostly in the framework of mode - coupling theory @xcite . for diluted colloidal solutions ,",
    "a theoretical description in terms of the two - particle correlations between the probe and the host liquid has been developed by brady et al.@xcite .",
    "a standard experiment in the context of active microrheology is the pulling of a single probe particle through a supercooled liquid with a constant external force @xmath0 @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rheology ] ( a ) of a schematic visualization .",
    "thereby , a characteristic quantity is the mobility @xmath1 of the probe , which is defined as the ratio of the stationary velocity @xmath2 of the particle along the force direction and the strength of the external field @xmath0 .",
    "the mobility is determined by the resistance the particle experiences during the motion through the supercooled liquid and is therefore a direct measure for the mechanical properties of the system @xcite . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rheology](b ) , the mobility is constant for small forces , which is in accordance with the einstein relation @xcite    @xmath3    where @xmath4 denotes the equilibrium diffusion constant , and @xmath5 the thermal energy of the system . for large forces , the mobility becomes itself force - dependent , thereby indicating a thinning of the local environment .",
    "for the physical description of non - equilibrium states , one often finds the concept of _ effective temperatures _ in literature @xcite .",
    "thereby , a new temperature @xmath6 is defined which includes , on the one hand , the temperature imposed by the thermostat and , on the other hand , the control parameter of non - equilibrium , e.g. the maximum strain of a shear cycle or the waiting time in an aging system .",
    "the exact definition can result from evaluating the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , studying the population of energies @xcite , applying weakly interacting degrees of freedom that act as a thermometer @xcite or simply via scaling relations of different dynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "for the case of force - driven active microrheology the latter relations have been observed for the inverse mobility @xmath7 and for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient of the tracer particle @xmath8 , however , with quite different values of @xmath6 . since one would expect a `` physical '' temperature to be independent from the studied quantity , the insights these scaling temperatures are somewhat limited .",
    "a novel way to describe microrheology in supercooled liquids is the application of the potential energy landscape ( pel ) approach .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is to relate the dynamics of the system to its thermodynamic state , characterized by its overall potential energy @xcite .",
    "in particular it turns out that the dynamics of supercooled liquids can be related to escape events out of mesoscopic funnels in the pel , formed by a set of local minima , which is called metabasins ( mb ) @xcite .",
    "although the escape out of a single mb is a complicated process , which may contain several transitions between local minima , it can be described as a single activated process over a energy barrier that depends on the depth of the funnel @xcite .",
    "this is in striking accordance to the trap model @xcite that has been successfully applied to understand the connection between thermodynamics and dynamics in supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "on a more coarse grained level , the sequence of escapes from the mbs is largely uncorrelated and can be described in terms of a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) scheme @xcite .",
    "recently , the pel approach has been used to describe the dynamics of a driven tracer particle in terms of a ctrw through its underlying pel @xcite .",
    "thereby it has been found that the pel approach offers a non - trivial decomposition of the linear and nonlinear response of @xmath9 into two independent quantities . in particular",
    ", one finds that the spatial part of the mobility behaves essentially constant , whereas the average waiting time @xmath10 in between two transitions or , equivalently , the average rate @xmath11 of a transition strongly varies ; thereby , @xmath12 denotes a number average , whereas @xmath13 denotes the average taken with respect to the boltzmann distribution of energies , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : defavgamma ] ) further below .",
    "this very different behavior means that the temporal part of the mobility is the main source of nonlinearity and , thus , that the understanding of the nonlinearity of the relevant timescale is identical to understanding the nonlinearity of the mobility itself .    in this article",
    "we offer a quantitative microscopic description of the thinning behavior of force - dependent mobility @xmath9 . for this purpose",
    "we have conducted computer simulations of a typical glass - forming model liquid which allows us to study the real space dynamics simultaneous to the dynamics of the system in its underlying pel ( for details , see methods ) .",
    "we first analyze the effect of the external force on the energy distribution , which can be rationalized in terms of an effective temperature @xmath6 . for this effective temperature , a universal scaling with a single parameter",
    "is observed which can be applied for nearly all forces and temperatures studied in this work .",
    "second , we study the force dependence of the local escape rates and provide a description in terms of an extended trap model .",
    "thereby we find that the force dependence of this rates is governed by the same effective temperature as it was found for the thermodynamic quantity .",
    "third , both quantities can be combined to obtain a quantitative description of the average escape rate @xmath11 in terms of @xmath6 . as a consequence",
    "the dynamics of the system behaves during the application of an external force similar to the dynamics of a quiescent system at a higher ( bath ) temperature , resulting in a force - temperature superposition .",
    "this result can be directly applied to the real - space mobility . in the last step ,",
    "we apply the concept , within some approximations though , to the diffusive properties of the system .",
    "thereby we observe a similar scaling with the same effective temperature as for the mobility , however , the quality of the scaling depends on the studied quantity , due to the different validity of the applied approximation .",
    "we critically discuss that a slightly different choice of the scaling factor of the effective temperature can enhance the scaling properties of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "however , this can also lead to a loss of the physical meaning of the so defined effective temperature .",
    "we have conducted molecular dynamics simulations ( md ) of a binary ( 80:20 ) mixture lennard - jones particles where the potential parameters of kob and andersen  @xcite have been used . since the analysis of the underlying pel requires small system sizes  @xcite the potential cutoff radius has been reduced to @xmath14 ( in dimensionless lennard - jones units ) which allows us to perform simulations of systems with @xmath15 particles .",
    "this system size is known to display only very small finite size effects concerning its diffusive behavior in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "as is can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsize ] , also the mobility studied in this work is only very weakly dependent on the size of the system and the small system only displays deviations about @xmath16 .    at the beginning of the simulation one of the majority particles of the system",
    "is randomly chosen and pulled by a constant force along a certain direction , thereby reaching a steady - state regime  @xcite .",
    "constant temperature conditions have been achieved by coupling the bath particles ( all particles except of the tracer ) to a nos - hoover thermostat  @xcite .",
    "we show in the supplemental material @xcite that , in the range of forces we are studying in this work , the driving of the tracer causes no unphysical fluctuations of the kinetic energy of the bath particles .",
    "we study a ( bath ) temperature range of @xmath17 which is slightly above the mode - coupling temperature @xmath18 of the system  @xcite . in this regime neither incomplete structural relaxation nor aging has been observed .",
    "the key step of our analysis is the tracking of the path the system has taken through its pel . for this purpose",
    "we compute the current inherent structure of the system at certain points in time by minimizing the potential energy of the system via conjugate gradient method .",
    "the minimization is done with a copy of the system so that the md trajectories are not influenced . for the computation of the potential energy ,",
    "only the lennard - jones interactions are taken into account .",
    "this choice is necessary to compare the states of the driven and to those of the undriven system , since only in this case they all belong to the very same pel .    at the end of the simulations , all inherent structures , between which forward - backwards transitions are observed ,",
    "are combined to metabasins , whereas the structure with the lowest potential energy , which is typically the most frequently visited one , defines the energy . the exact protocol to determine the metabasins involves some minor subtleties which are described in  @xcite .",
    "in the pel description , the overall escape rate from an arbitrary mb depends on two formally independent quantities : the distribution @xmath19 of mb energies @xmath20 populated by the system , which is a purely thermodynamic quantity and the rates @xmath21 to escape from a mb of energy @xmath20 , which describe the local kinetics .",
    "the escape rates @xmath21 are defined as the inverse average waiting time @xmath22 before leaving a mb of energy @xmath20 .",
    "the brackets thereby denote the average over different realizations . the total average escape rate or , equivalently , the inverse average waiting time is given by  @xcite    @xmath23    where the index @xmath24 of @xmath25 shall emphasize that the average has been taken with respect to the energy distribution @xmath19 .",
    "applying an external perturbation may alter the thermodynamics , the local kinetics or both in a different manner , giving rise to the observed nonlinear behavior of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the understanding of the force dependences of @xmath26 and @xmath27 immediately offer the understanding of the nonlinear mobility in general .      *",
    "( a ) *        * ( b ) *        * ( c ) *        * ( d ) *        the thermodynamic state of the system is characterized by the boltzmann distribution of energies @xmath19 .",
    "numerically , @xmath19 can simply determined by computing the energy of a mb at arbitrary chosen points in time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](a ) , @xmath19 is shown for a quiescent system at different temperatures .",
    "all curves display a gaussian shape , which is shifted to larger values as the temperature is increased .",
    "in contrast to the average value , the width as well as the height of the distribution is not dependent on the temperature .    in the quiescent system for @xmath28 , at which the anharmonic contributions of the local minimum are fully negligible @xcite , the energy distribution results from the density of states ( dos ) @xmath29 via    @xmath30    where the states are weighted by the thermal energy of the system . with this equation",
    ", one can determine the underlying dos by rescaling the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](a ) . as it is shown in @xcite ,",
    "the underlying dos is a gaussian with the same width as @xmath19 .",
    "the dynamics of the system can still be described for @xmath31 in terms of the original ( @xmath32 ) potential energy minima since the minima including the external force are , as we show in the supplemental material @xcite , basically the same in the range of forces displayed in .",
    "it will be of key importance how the additional force changes the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](b ) @xmath27 is shown for different force strengths .",
    "one observes that the gaussian shape of the distribution is recovered also in the non - equilibrium case , but the distribution is shifted to higher energies .",
    "the width of the distribution is not altered by the application of the force .",
    "this is remarkable , since it displays the same characteristics which have already been observed for @xmath19 in the quiescent system at different temperatures , see fig .  [",
    "fig : energy](a ) .",
    "in particular , microrheological forcing and heating are indistinguishable in terms of the energy distribution .",
    "this striking similarity between forcing and heating motivates the definition of an effective temperature which characterizes the shift of @xmath27 .",
    "since , as mentioned above , @xmath29 is by construction independent from the force , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : pepst ] ) and insert the @xmath27 for the energy distribution :    @xmath33    thereby it is implicitly assumed that the energy distribution is a boltzmann distribution , however , controlled by the effective temperature @xmath6 rather than the bath temperature @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](c ) for different forces .",
    "it can be observed that plotting the data according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : defteff ] ) offers well defined straight lines whose slopes can be interpreted as the inverse effective temperatures .",
    "this observation supports the idea that the energy distribution can be regarded at least formally as boltzmann distributed .",
    "the definition for @xmath6 used above is similar to that in  @xcite where it has been applied to characterize the non - equilibrium thermodynamics of a aging system and a system under an oscillatory shear strain .",
    "however , in these references only the average value of the energy distribution has been used to determine @xmath6 .",
    "while in this particular case both definitions would lead essentially to the same values , it has been found in another context  @xcite , that the average value alone might be misleading , since it can result from very different distributions . using",
    "the procedure depicted above would uncover such deviations by not showing straight lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy](c ) . for later purposes ,",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : pepst ] ) for @xmath31 according to the effective temperature defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defteff ] ) :    @xmath35    how is this effective temperature dependent on the external force ? since",
    "the shift of the energy distribution must be symmetric concerning the direction of the applied force , it reasonable to assume that it is an even function in @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of @xmath36 , @xmath6 must recover the bath temperature @xmath34 .",
    "because of this , a natural guess for the force dependence of @xmath6 is    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is a force and temperature independent parameter .",
    "a similar guess has been justified by a mean - field theory of a brownian particle in a viscoelastic medium @xcite . in this reference , the prefactor has , however , been identified with the mobility of the brownian particle , which in the present case is strongly dependent on force and temperature .",
    "thus , the relevance of the results from @xcite for microrheology of supercooled liquids is unclear .",

    "one observes two distinct regimes :    @xmath46    with the critical mb energy of the system @xmath47 and a slope @xmath48 .",
    "since the dynamics of the system are merely determined by the slow escape rates , corresponding to large energy barriers , the following analysis will focus on the low - energy part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eapp ] ) .    for the case",
    "@xmath49 , the activation energy is in agreement with the trap model  @xcite , where the mbs serve as traps : the system has to overcome a barrier equal to the depth of the trap plus a small additional barrier @xmath50 .",
    "what is the meaning of the factor @xmath51 at low energies ?",
    "although our simulations are conducted with a very small system , only a small set of particles is moving at the same time  @xcite . to estimate the implications for @xmath44",
    "one may consider that the simulated system consists of @xmath52 non - interacting subsystems , each one relaxing independently from each other .",
    "the escape rates one measures is therefore the rate one observes for the overall system , i.e. sum of the rates of each individual subsystem @xmath53 : @xmath54 .",
    "if one now assumes that the energy of the system is distributed equally among the @xmath52 subsystems , one immediately obtains @xmath55 , thus , the actual barrier , which has to be overcome , is reduced by a factor @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "these ideas give rise to the notion of an `` extended trap model ''  @xcite .",
    "considering that the activation energy is proportional to the trap depth ( eq .  ( [ eq : eapp ] ) ) , one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : get ] ) as    @xmath57    where the right hand side has been identified with the ratio of the energy distribution and the density of states , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : pepst ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : dt ] ) , however , both the diffusive length scales @xmath67 and the average hopping rate @xmath25 have been replaced by their force dependent counter parts .",
    "the only difference between for @xmath8 and @xmath81 is the relevant diffusive length scale , either @xmath85 or @xmath86 , which can be determined from the mean - squared displacements of the respective particle types after a certain number of mb transitions .    for the evaluation purely in real space , eq .",
    "( [ eq : df ] ) is less helpful since the pel parameters are inaccessible .",
    "similarly to what has been done for the mobility in the previous section , one one can therefore make the assumption that the diffusive length scales are basically independent of the external force ( and temperature , since @xmath87 ) .",
    "if this assumption holds , eq .",
    "( [ eq : df ] ) simplifies to    @xmath88    for both diffusion coefficients .",
    "the test of this assumption is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftsd](a),(b ) .    for the diffusion coefficient of",
    "the tracer particle one finds that the theoretical prediction is only in a qualitative agreement with the rescaled data points .",
    "please notice , however , that in the analyzed temperature range the diffusion coefficient varies over three orders of magnitude , which is reasonably reflected by the theory .",
    "for @xmath89 , a much better agreement can be observed : the data points collapse on a master curve which agrees up to the harmonic breakdown at @xmath90 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : df2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the different qualities of the prediction is the validity of the assumption that the spatial part is not dependent on the applied force .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftsd](c ) , the spatial part of the bath particles ( lower branch ) varies only very little as compared to the quiescent length scale .",
    "in contrast , the length scale of the tracer particle grows half an order of magnitude ( upper branch ) . in the first case ,",
    "the applied assumption is much better fulfilled , resulting in a better scaling in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftsd](b ) . for the tracer particle diffusion ,",
    "please consider , that the spatial part of the tracer diffusion varies _ at most _ half an order of magnitude .",
    "in the same regime , the temporal part , which can be very well described by our model , extends over one to two orders of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ftsmu](b ) ) .",
    "this explains why the presented approach still allows a reasonable description of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftsd](a ) .",
    "our results shown above are in some disagreement with the work presented in @xcite where it has been shown that the mobility and the orthogonal diffusion of the tracer particle obey a force - temperature superposition , however , with different effective temperatures .",
    "adopted to our notation , these two temperatures differ in the value of @xmath38 which turns out to be a factor of @xmath91 larger for the orthogonal diffusion than for the nonlinear mobility .",
    "indeed , also for our data a larger value of @xmath38 ( here increased by @xmath92 for a different system ) allows a nearly perfect scaling of the numerical data on a master curve , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ftsd](d ) .",
    "however , the effective temperature resulting from such a rescaling is somewhat artificial , since it has lost its connection to the thermodynamic and , in this application , kinetic properties it was originally derived from .",
    "effective temperatures purely derived from scaling laws should therefore be treated with some caution , because its importance for the description of non - equilibrium thermodynamics is a priori unclear .",
    "in this work , we have derived a microscopic approach to describe the thinning behavior of nonlinear active microrheology in supercooled liquids . for this purpose",
    "we have applied the pel approach to describe the thermodynamics and dynamics of the driven system which offers valuable insight into the relationship of each other , even far away from equilibrium .",
    "our results could show that the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the system far from equilibrium are governed by a single effective temperature that can qualitatively connected to the properties to the quiescent energy landscape . since one can transfer this behavior , within some approximations however , to real space quantities like the force - dependent mobility and the orthogonal diffusion coefficient",
    ", it may encourage tests of this results in experiments as well as in other theoretical models of supercooled liquids .",
    "this work was financially supported by dfg research unit 1394 `` nonlinear response to probe vitrification '' and nrw graduate school of chemistry .",
