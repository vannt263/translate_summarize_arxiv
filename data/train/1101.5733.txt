    "there are three main propagation effects in the magnetosphere of radio pulsars .",
    "they are refraction , cyclotron absorption , and the limiting polarization effects .",
    "the limiting polarization effect is related to the escape of radio emission from the region of dense plasma , where the propagation is well described within the geometrical optics approximation ( in this case , the polarization ellipse is defined by the orientation of the external magnetic field in the picture plane ) , into the region of rarefied plasma , where the polarization of the wave remains almost constant along the ray .",
    "this process has been well - studied ( zheleznyakov , 1996 ; kravtsov & orlov , 1980 ) and applied successfully , e.g. , to the problem of solar radio emission ( zheleznyakov , 1970 )",
    ".    however , in the theory of the pulsar radio emission such a problem has not been finally solved . above the papers , where the position of the transition level @xmath0 between the domains of the geometrical optics and vacuum approximations was estimated ( see , e.g. , cheng & ruderman 1979 ; barnard , 1986 ) , one can actually note only the papers by petrova & lyubarskii ( 2000a ) ( where the problem in the infinite magnetic field was considered ) , and by wang , lai & han ( 2010 ) ( see petrova , 2003 , 2006 as well ) .",
    "but in all these papers the equations describing the evolution of the electric field of the waves were analysed .",
    "this approach can not make the direct predictions concerning the polarization properties of the outgoing radiation .",
    "we use another approach describing the propagation of electromagnetic waves in weakly inhomogeneous media , i.e. , the method of the kravtsov - orlov equation that is well known in plasma physics and crystal - optics .",
    "it gives us the opportunity to write directly the equations on observable quantities , i.e. , the position angle and the degree of circular polarization ( cp ) .",
    "also , the cyclotron absorbtion that naturaly occurs in finite magnetic field , and the possible linear transformation of waves can be easily included into consideration .",
    "the preliminary results based on the simple model of the magnetic field structure and energy distribution of particles flowing in the magnetosphere were already published by andrianov & beskin ( 2010 ) .",
    "it was shown that for radio pulsars with known circular polarization and the swing of the linear polarization position angle one can determine which mode , ordinary or extraordinary one , forms mainly the mean profile of the radio emission .",
    "later , the arbitrary non - dipole magnetic field configuration , the drift motion of plasma particles , and their realistic energy distribution function were taken into account as well . the detailed quantitative analysis of these effects will be presented in our separated paper .",
    "the goal of this letter is in qualitative comparison of the main predictions of the theory with observational data . in our opinion",
    ", they are in a very good agreement .",
    "starting from the pioneer paper by barnard and arons ( 1986 ) , people discussed three waves propagating outward in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1 , for small enough angles @xmath1 between the wave vector @xmath2 and the external magnetic field @xmath3 two of them , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are transverse waves , and the third mode @xmath6 corresponds to plasma wave .",
    "the point is that in the most of papers ( see e.g. melrose & gedalin , 1999 ) the waves properties were considered in the comoving reference frame in which the plasma waves propagating outward and backward are identical .",
    "but in the laboratory reference frame ( in which the plasma moves with the velocity @xmath7 ) the latter wave is to propagate outward as well .",
    "thus , in reality we have four waves propagating outward .",
    "moreover , as was demonstrated by beskin , gurevich & istomin ( 1993 ) , it is the fourth wave that is to be considered as the o - mode in the pulsar magnetosphere . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , for dense enough plasma in the radio generation domain for which @xmath8 where @xmath9 it is this wave that propagates as transverse one at large angles @xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i.e. , at large distances from the neutron star . here",
    "@xmath10 is the plasma frequency , @xmath11 is the concentration of particles , and @xmath12 is the mean lorentz - factor of the outflowing plasma .",
    "two waves , for which the refractive index @xmath13 , can not escape from the magnetosphere as at large distances they propagate along the magnetic field lines ( and due to landau damping , see barnard & arons , 1986 ) .",
    "in the hydrodynamical limit one can easily obtain the dispersion curves shown in fig . 1 from the well - known dispersion equation for the infinite magnetic field ( see , e.g. , petrova & lyubarskii , 2000 ) @xmath14 - n^2 \\sin^2\\theta = 0.\\ ] ] for @xmath15 and for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 there are two transverse and two plasma waves , but for @xmath8 the nontrivial transformation from longitudinal to transverse wave takes place .",
    "it means that for @xmath8 the mode @xmath18 can be emitted as a plasma wave , but it will escape from the magnetosphere as a transverse one .",
    "the kravtsov - orlov equation describes the evolution of the complex angle @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a position angle of the polarization ellipse , and @xmath21 determines the circular polarization by the relation @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the intensity of the wave , and @xmath24 is the stokes parameter . as was shown ( andrianov & beskin , 2010 , beskin & philippov , 2011 ) , the kravtsov - orlov equation can be rewritten as @xmath25 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\omega}{c } \\lambda{\\mathrm{cos}}[2\\theta_1 - 2\\beta(l)-2\\delta(l)]{\\rm sinh}2\\theta_2 , \\label{t1}\\\\ \\frac{{\\rm d}\\theta_2}{{\\rm d}l } = & & \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\omega}{c}\\lambda\\sin[2\\theta_1 - 2\\beta(l)-2\\delta(l ) ] { \\rm cosh}2\\theta_2 , \\label{t2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{x'x'}-\\varepsilon_{y'y'}}{2}\\right)^2},\\ ] ] where the signs corresponds to the regions before / after the cyclotron resonance and @xmath27}{\\varepsilon_{y'y'}-\\varepsilon_{x'x'}}.\\ ] ] we would like to note , that in this equations the circular polarization is defined as it is common in radioastronomy ( positive v corresponds to the co - clockwise rotating electric field vector for the observer ) . here @xmath28 is a coordinate along the ray propagation , and the angle @xmath29 defines the orientation of the external magnetic field in the picture plane . in the geometric optics region ( @xmath30 )",
    "the o - mode corresponds to polarization @xmath31 , and x - mode corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "finally , @xmath33 are the components of plasma dielectric tensor in the reference frame where @xmath34-axis directs along the wave propagation and the external magnetic field lies in @xmath35-plane . in comparison with model considered by andrianov & beskin ( 2010 ) , equations ( [ t1])([t2 ] ) include into consideration nonzero components @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "it allows us to take into account the electric drift of plasma particles .",
    "this effect just corresponds to aberration considered by blaskiewicz , cordes & wasserman ( 1991 ) .",
    "this effect was also considered by petrova & lyubarskii ( 2000a ) , but for the infinite magnetic field only .",
    "thus , knowing the magnetic field structure and plasma properties of the outgoing plasma ( i.e. , knowing the dielectric tensor @xmath33 ) one can determine the observable physical quantities , namely , the stokes parameter @xmath37 defining the cp and the position angle @xmath38 characterizing the orientation of the polarization ellipse .",
    "this approach is valid in the quasi - isotropic case when there are two small parameters , i.e. , the general wkb condition @xmath39 and the condition @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "as the refractive index @xmath18 differs from unity , the appropriate ordinary mode is to deflect from the magnetic axis until @xmath42 .",
    "as was already mentioned , for the o - mode this effect takes place until @xmath43 , i.e. , for small enough distances from the neutron star @xmath44 , where @xmath45 here @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the netron star radius , rotation period ( in s ) , and magnetic field ( in @xmath49 g ) , respectively .",
    "accordingly , @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the wave frequency in ghz , and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the multiplicity of the particle creation near magnetic poles ( @xmath54 is the goldreich - julian concentration ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse extraordinary wave with the refractive index ( x - mode ) is to propagate freely .",
    "as the radius @xmath55 is much smaller than the escape radius @xmath0 ( cheng & ruderman , 1979 , andrianov & beskin , 2010 ) @xmath56 one can consider the effects of refraction and limiting polarization separately .",
    "in particular , this implies that one can consider the propagation of waves in the region @xmath57 as rectilinear .    as a result , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , if two modes are generated at the same distance @xmath58 from the neutron star where @xmath59 , the directivity pattern of the o - mode is to be wider than that for the x - mode .",
    "hence , it is logical to assosiate the x - mode with the core component of the directivity pattern . on the other hand ,",
    "the o - mode is to form the conal component .",
    "e.g. , assuming the constant plasma density across the flow ( more realistic regime was considered by petrova & lyubarskii , 2000 ) , beskin , gurevich & istomin ( 1993 ) obtained for the radio window width @xmath60 @xmath61 for the o - mode , the theory gives two radiation beam widths , depending on the distribution of the energy release power in height .",
    "the main new theoretical result based on the analysis of kravtsov - orlov equations ( [ t1])([t2 ] ) is that for large enough derivative @xmath62 , the sign of the stokes parameter @xmath24 is to be determined not by the poorly defined nondiagonal components of the dielectric tensor @xmath63 , when @xmath64 ( zheleznyakov , 1977 ) and @xmath65 but by the sign of the derivative @xmath62 .",
    "it takes place when one can neglect the first term in the r.h.s . of eqn .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) in comparison with the derivative @xmath66 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) : @xmath69}. \\label{main}\\ ] ] here @xmath70 is dimensionles distance along the ray .",
    "hence , for large enough @xmath71 ( the total turn @xmath72 within the light cylinder @xmath73 ) , and for small angle of propagation @xmath74 through the relativistic plasma ( @xmath75 ) the stokes parameter @xmath24 ( [ main ] ) is indeed much larger than @xmath64 resulting from standard evaluation .",
    "moreover , numerical calculations ( beskin & philippov , 2011 ) shows that the sign of the derivative @xmath62 is opposite to the sign of the derivative @xmath76 .    as a result , one can formulate the following predictions :    * for the x - mode ( @xmath32 ) the theory predicts the same signs of the circular polarization @xmath24 and the derivative @xmath77 .",
    "* for the o - mode ( @xmath78 ) the signs of the circular polarization @xmath24 and the derivative @xmath77 are to be opposite . * for radio pulsar with the tripple mean pulses we have to see the o - mode first , than x- and again the o - mode because , as was shown in fig .",
    "2 , the o - mode deviates from magnetic axis . * in general ,",
    "the trailing part of the main pulse can be absorbed ( see dyks , wright & demorest , 2010 as well ) . * the leading component can be absorbed only if the polarization formes near the light cylinder ( @xmath79 ) . in this case",
    "the @xmath80 is to be approximately constant in given mode as the magnetic field here is approx .",
    "homogeneous ( a.spitkovsky , private communication ) .",
    "* statistically , we expect single profiles for the x - mode ( if only the x - mode is observed ) and the double ones for the o - mode .    in the following section we will try to demonstrate that these predictions are indeed in good agreement with observational data .",
    "in table  [ table1 ] we collected more than 70 pulsars from two reviews by weltevrede & johnston ( 2008 ) and hankins & rankin ( 2010 ) for which both the values of @xmath80 and @xmath24 were well - determined .",
    "as was predicted , most pulsars with double ( d ) mean profile corresponds to the o - mode ( the opposite signs of @xmath24 and @xmath77 ) , and the most pulsars with single ( s ) mean profiles  to the x - mode ( the same signs of @xmath24 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "moreover , statistically the o - mode pulsars have wider mean pulses than x - mode , their values being in good agreement with theoretical predictions ( [ w1])([w3 ] ) .    .statistics of pulsars with known circular polarization @xmath24 and position angle swing .",
    "pulsar period @xmath47 is in seconds , and the window width @xmath81 is in degrees . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]      below we analyse the profiles of several tripple pulsars presented in review by johnston et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for which both @xmath80 and @xmath24 are well - determined at any way at one frequency , 693 , 1374 , or 3100 mhz .    for pulsar psr j0452@xmath821759 the triple structure",
    "is seen at 693 mhz only .",
    "for this reason , it is not surprizing that the @xmath83-switch of the @xmath80 from o - mode to x - mode and return is seen on this frequency only .",
    "the cp is well - determined in the trailing subpulse only , where its sign , as was predicted , corresponds to o - mode .",
    "the tripple structure of the pulsar psr j0738@xmath824042 is seen on the @xmath80 profile at 691 mhz only . nevertheless , as the @xmath80 is approximately constant at low frequency ( see table 2 )",
    ", one can assume that the leading part of the profile is absorbed .",
    "then , the leading subpulse is to correspond the x - mode , and the trailing one  to the o - mode ( the appropriate negative cp is seen in this subpulse only ) .    in pulsar psr j1559@xmath824438",
    "the tripple structure o - x - o is well - seen at all frequencies 691 , 1374 , and 3100 mhz , but in the mean profile the conal component is detected at the frequency 3100 mhz only .",
    "the negative cp for core subpule corresponding to the x - mode is seen at all frequencies .",
    "the cp of the tripple pulsar psr j2048@xmath821616 , as was predicted , corresponds to o - x - o structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the switch of the @xmath80 is absent , that can be caused , in our opinion , by the averaging technique and should be checked in the individual profiles as well ( one can see the influence of the averaging technique on the cp profile in karastergiou et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "thus , as we see , the properties of the pulsars with triple mean profiles are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the central ( core ) components of the mean profiles , in general , connect with the x - mode propagating freely , while the conal parts correspond to the o - mode deflecting via the refraction from the magnetic axis .",
    "here the same analysis for pulsars with interpulses from paper by keith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is given .",
    "the observations were made at the frequency 1.4 ghz .",
    "the main pulse of pulsar psr j0627@xmath840706 is to be connected with the o - mode ( it has the opposite signs of @xmath80 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the trailing subpulse of the double profile , as is well seen from the @xmath80 swing ( the observable subpulse corresponds to the first half of the s - shape curve ) is absorbed . in the interpulse the circular polarization is not high enough to determine modes .",
    "the central part of the main pulse of pulsar psr j1549@xmath824848 is formed by the x - mode ( the same signs of the @xmath80 and @xmath24 ) . in the leading and the trailing parts of the main pulse the cp is too low to say anything about the conal component .",
    "the interpulse has the triple structiure , the sequence of the modes , as was predicted , being o - x - o .",
    "this is clear not only from the negative - positive - negative sequence of the stokes parameter @xmath24 but from the singularity of the @xmath80 at the phase @xmath85 .",
    "the main pulse of pulsar psr j1722@xmath82371 is formed mainly by the x - mode .",
    "the cp of the interpulse is too low to determine the modes .",
    "the double main pulse of the pulsar psr j1739@xmath822903 is to be interpreted as the sequence of the o- and x - modes .",
    "it is clear both from the negative - to - positive change of the stokes parameter @xmath24 and from the @xmath83 jump in @xmath80 the trailing ( o - mode ) component is absorbed because , as for psr j0627@xmath840706 , the leading o - mode subpulse corresponds only to the first half of the s - shape curve of the @xmath80 .",
    "the interpulse is formed by the x - mode .    in the main pulse of pulsar psr",
    "j1828@xmath821101 the value @xmath24 is not high enough to determine the mode .",
    "the interpulse is formed mainly by the o - mode , the trailing subpulse being absorbed ( here again the @xmath80 of the visible pulse corresponds to the first half of the s - shape curve ) .",
    "thus , for radio pulsars with interpulse the interpretation on the ground of the theory under consideration is reasonable as well .",
    "finally , we consider the millisecond pulsars which detailed polarization characteristics were presented recently by yan et al . , ( 2011 ) .",
    "the observations were made at the frequency 1369 mhz .",
    "pulsar psr j0437@xmath824715 has the multiple mean profile .",
    "its leading and the trailing parts ( i.e. , the conal component ) definitely corresponds to the o - mode . on the other hand , both the @xmath83 jump in @xmath80 and the change of the stokes parameter sign in the core component shows that the central subpulse consists not only of the x - mode , but of the o - mode as well .",
    "the leading and the trailing components of the double profile of pulsar psr j1022@xmath841001 , in agreement with the prediction , are formed by the o - mode .",
    "the peak on the @xmath80 curve in the center of the mean profile could be connected with the core x - mode , but its intensity is too low to be seen on the mean pfofile .",
    "pulsar psr j1045@xmath824509 has the triple main profile .",
    "it has different signs of the circular polarization in the core and conal components .",
    "but the position angle swing is irregular , which prevent us to determine the modes .    in pulsar psr j1600@xmath823053",
    "the core component is definitely formed by the x - mode ( the same signs of the stokes parameter @xmath24 and the derivative @xmath77 ) . then , the conal component is to be connected with the o - mode as its @xmath80 curve locates approx . @xmath83 higher that that for the core component .",
    "the circular polarization is too low to confirm this point .",
    "the circular polarization of the central part of the double profile of pulsar psr j1603@xmath827202 is different from the conal ones .",
    "the irregular character of the @xmath80 swing does not allow us to determine the mode .",
    "pulsar psr j1643@xmath821224 has the single main profile which can be easily interpreted as standard o - x - o sequence with the absorbed trailing part .",
    "indeed , the polarization of the leading part definitely corresponds to the o - mode ( the different signs of @xmath24 and @xmath77 ) , while the trailing part is to be connected with the x - mode ( the same signs of @xmath24 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "moreover , the derivative @xmath77 is much larger in the trailing part .",
    "this implies that the visible pulse corresponds the first half of the s - shape curve .",
    "pulsar psr j1713@xmath840747 has multicomponent profile containing both modes .",
    "it has different signs of the circular polarization for different branches of the p.a",
    ". curves .",
    "pulsar psr j1732@xmath825049 has actually zero circular polarization which does not allow us to determine the modes .",
    "nevertheless , one can see that the @xmath80 of the core and conal parts belongs to the different modes .",
    "the profile of pulsar psr j1909@xmath823744 is quite similar to psr j1643@xmath821224 .",
    "hence , it can be easily interpreted as o - x - o sequence with the absorbed trailing part as well .",
    "radiation of pulsar psr j2129@xmath825721 is to be connected with the core conponent formed by the x - mode ( the same signs of @xmath24 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "two subpulses of the mean profile can be easily explained by the central passage through the directivety pattern ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    in addition , the double profile pulsars psr j0613@xmath820200 , j0711@xmath826830 have the same signs of the stokes parameter @xmath24 in both subpulses .",
    "but it is impossibe to connect them with the o - mode because of the irregular swing ofthe @xmath80 .",
    "finally , pulsars j1024@xmath820719 , j1730@xmath822304 , j1744@xmath821134 , j1824@xmath822452 , j1857@xmath840943 , 2124@xmath823358 , and j2145@xmath820750 have irregular structure or actually zero circular polarization which does not allow us to analyse their properties .",
    "thus , in that cases when the @xmath80 swing and the stokes parameter @xmath24 are regular enough , the main properties of the mean profiles can be easily interpreted within the theory under consideration .",
