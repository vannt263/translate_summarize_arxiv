    "neutral hydrogen ( hi ) is one of the most promising probes of the high - redshift universe .",
    "it can be used to uniquely trace the matter distribution at early times well into the dark ages and the cosmic dawn era , reveal the cosmic reionization process and shed light on the complex astrophysics in early galaxy formation , and probe the large - scale structure at late times , allowing measurements of the geometry and structure growth of the universe . to obtain statistical measurement of the three - dimensional structure of hi in emission ,",
    "the intensity mapping technique has been advocated ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . making use of the redshifted",
    "21 cm hi intensity mapping dataset obtained at the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , @xcite and @xcite have measured the hi cross - power spectrum with the wigglez optical galaxies and reported limits on the hi auto - power spectrum , respectively , in the frequency range of 700 - 900 mhz or a redshifted hi range of @xmath6 . combining the cross - power and auto - power spectrum , the neutral hydrogen fluctuation amplitude , @xmath7 has been constrained as @xmath8\\times 10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "the main challenges of hi intensity mapping at these redshifts include synchrotron foreground radiation and man - made radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "localized synchrotron emission from extragalactic sources and diffuse synchrotron emission from the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the milky way are the dominant astronomical foreground signals in the frequency range of interest . in the gbt hi observing fields reported by @xcite , which are at high galactic latitudes ,",
    "the synchrotron emission is still three orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signals .",
    "however , synchrotron radiation is expected to be spectrally smooth ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if all the instrumental effects , including calibration , spectral response , and primary beam pattern , are well understood and controlled , the synchrotron foregrounds will then have fewer degrees of freedom than the hi signals along the line of sight , or along the frequency direction , and can be separated . in the gbt data , rfi is found to be removable or controllable by flagging of frequency channels .    a crucial instrumental effect that needs to be controlled is polarization leakage .",
    "although hi emission is considered unpolarized , the leakage of polarized synchrotron foreground emission into total intensity via imperfect instrumental response could introduce excess power and extra degrees of freedom into the observed intensity signal .",
    "simulations suggest polarized intensity of galactic foregrounds can contain frequency structure via faraday rotation induced by the ism ; leakages of such spectrally fluctuating polarization intensity into total intensity could thus mimic the hi signals along the frequency or redshift direction ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , polarization leakage itself may not be a smooth function of frequency .",
    "therefore , one may not be able to simply separate polarization leakage from hi signals by isolating spectrally smooth patterns .",
    "the polarized galactic foreground is one to two orders of magnitude fainter than total intensity in regions with low galactic synchrotron emission at the frequency of interest .",
    "the amplitude in total intensity due to polarization leakage would be comparable to that of the hi signals if the leakage fraction is at the percentage level , which is common in single dish radio telescopes @xcite .",
    "therefore , polarization calibration needs to be performed very carefully to eliminate the contamination from polarized foreground signals .",
    "recent investigation of lofar polarization leakage by @xcite provides a good estimate of polarization calibration errors ( less than @xmath9 ) of inflicted on the hi signal of interest at 150 mhz . as an interferometer",
    ", the redundancy of lofar baselines dramatically reduces the integrated polarization calibration errors ; this is however not the case for single dish telescopes .",
    "besides , @xcite suggest that the foreground polarization fraction at @xmath10 150 mhz is one order of magnitude lower than that at 1.4 ghz .",
    "polarization calibration with single dishes is potentially a challenge at 800 mhz .",
    "performing polarization calibration with a signal dish radio telescope with dual receptors , such as the gbt , usually entails determining the jones matrix , which describes the instrumental response of the two polarization receptors to sky signals at each frequency channel .",
    "polarized astrophysical sources are often used to solve for the jones matrices ( e.g. : @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "psrchive ( @xcite ) , a software that is widely used for single dish radio polarization calibration in the pulsar community , uses pulsar observations at multiple parallactic angles to solve for the jones matrix at each frequency channel . in this work ,",
    "we use the jones matrix model described by @xcite , which is adopted in psrchive , to parametrize jones matrices .",
    "we obtain both pulsar and quasar observations from the gbt .",
    "we first solve for the first - order approximation to the jones matrix model parameters using pulsar data and the psrchive software , then fine tune the parameters using quasar observations .",
    "we begin with a brief introduction to gbt 800 mhz receiver and the back - end systems we use in this work in section [ sec : instrument ] .",
    "the polarization calibration on boresight is discussed in detail in section [ sec : on_cal ] .    besides polarization leakage on boresight ,",
    "another key element is to characterize the polarized primary beam pattern of a telescope .",
    "pulsar observations have the adventage that it is easy to separate on - axis pulsar signal and stationary off - axis leakage by subtracting off - pulse from on - pulse data . on the other hand ,",
    "since both on - axis signal and off - axis leakage are stationary in our intensity mapping observations , off - axis leakage is therefore an issue that needs to be addressed . in section [ sec :",
    "beam ] , we use spider scans of quasars and pulsars to investigate the polarization beam pattern of the gbt .",
    "these patterns are important for the interpretation of the hi intensity mapping power spectrum .",
    "the procedure we are using to calibrate real data is summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we will discuss the results and limits of our investigation in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "here we briefly describe the gbt 800 mhz receiver and backend system .",
    "the gbt has an off - axis optical design ; the 800 mhz receiver is a prime - focus instrument that operates at 680 - 920 mhz .",
    "the feed is a corrugated feed horn with an orthomode transducer ( omt ) polarization splitter .",
    "there are known resonances associated with the omt at 796.6 mhz and 817.4 mhz , which we omit from the analysis .",
    "a noise diode signal is injected after the omt at 2 k level and switches at 15.26 hz .",
    "we use the green bank ultimate pulsar processing instrument ( guppi ) pulsar back - end systems @xcite , with a bandwidth of 200 mhz ( 700 - 900 mhz ) over 4096 frequency channels , and integrate over 1 ms intervals .",
    "guppi has the pulsar - folding capability which we use in our analysis .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "in this section we present the method for polarization calibration at the beam center , or boresight , without considering the angular response of the primary beam .",
    "we adopt the model described by @xcite to parametrize the jones matrix and use quasar and pulsar observations to find solutions for the jones matrix parameters .",
    "we then apply the parameters on quasar data to further correct for polarization leakage .      in the following sections we follow @xcite and @xcite to model the jones matrix .",
    "the mapping between the real sky electric field signal @xmath11 and the observed signal @xmath12 through an instrument is @xmath13 where @xmath14 , which is typically called jones matrix , is the instrumental response , and @xmath15 is the relative rotation between the sky and the receptor by a parallactic angle @xmath16 . if we transform eqn .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) into the basis of stokes parameters , we get @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a 4-vector representing stokes ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 ) , @xmath19 the @xmath20 mueller matrix , and @xmath21    note the relation between the 2-vector @xmath22 and 4-vector @xmath18 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is kronecker product and @xmath25    the relation between the jones matrix @xmath14 and mueller matrix @xmath19 is then @xmath26    @xmath14 can be parametrized as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , the absolute gain , is a scalar .",
    "@xmath29 is a matrix corresponding to the differential gain @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 is a matrix corresponding to the differential phase @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 is a matrix that represents a receiver with non - orthogonal receptors , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is written as @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the ellipticity and orientation of the receptor , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 is the selection matrix , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the kronecker delta .",
    "@xmath35 can be decomposed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is equivalent to the parallactic angle rotation .",
    "therefore , one can define @xmath46 and @xmath47 to separate the overall rotation from the relative rotation between receptors , and merge @xmath48 into parallactic angle rotation",
    ".    then one can transform @xmath14 to mueller matrix @xmath19 with eqn .",
    "( [ eq : jones_to_mueller ] ) .    to illustrate some of the structure of the jones and mueller matrices , we set ( @xmath49",
    "( [ eq : jones ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath50 and the mueller matrix becomes @xmath51    in summary , the jones matrix is a @xmath52 complex matrix , in principle it has eight degrees of freedom .",
    "however , from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : jones_to_mueller ] ) , one can see that the absolute phase of @xmath14 does not affect the mueller matrix @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the complete jones / mueller matrix model can be described by seven parameters , which are the absolute gain @xmath28 , the differential gain @xmath30 , the differential phase @xmath33 , @xmath53 the orientation of the two receptors , and the ellipticity of the receptors @xmath54 .",
    "one can observe a polarized source , such as a pulsar , to measure @xmath55 at parallactic angle @xmath16 . with data taken at several parallactic angles",
    ", one will have a set of simultaneous equations , @xmath56 , or @xmath57 in the stokes parameter basis .",
    "@xmath58 indexes the observation at parallactic angle @xmath59    before solving for both the incoming signals of the pulsar and the jones matrix parameters using these equations , we have to deal with two degeneracies : one of the degeneracies is between the stokes parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the incoming signal , and the other is between stokes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the degeneracies arise from the following : in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : multi - angle ] ) , one can equally substitute @xmath19 and @xmath18 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , as long as the matrix @xmath62 commutes with @xmath63 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath18 is one solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : multi - angle ] ) , @xmath61 will be another solution as well .",
    "in fact , any matrix @xmath62 of the following form , @xmath64 will commute with @xmath63 ( see appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "the first term of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : degeneracy ] ) corresponds to degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the second term degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "one way to break the degeneracy between stokes @xmath2 and @xmath3 is to observe a standard calibrator with a known ratio of stokes @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "there is a built - in noise diode at the gbt that can serve this function .",
    "ideally , the noise diode will produce pure linearly polarized signals at a position angle @xmath65 to the two orthogonal receptors .",
    "we can therefore break the degeneracy between stokes @xmath2 and @xmath3 by assuming that the noise diode produces no circular polarization signals .",
    "alternatively , we can assume the system circular polarization @xmath3 to be negligible while observing astrophysical calibrators .    as is the standard procedure , by taking the differences of on- and off - source observations of a standard calibrator , such as 3c295 , one can estimate its circular polarization .",
    "one can therefore break the degeneracy by assuming the stokes @xmath3 of standard calibrators , which are reported to have a negligible level of @xmath3 , to be zero .",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which makes it impossible to calibrate absolute polarization angles on the sky without an external reference , is related to the definition of angles .",
    "here we set the orientation of the first receptor by fixing @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , @xmath67 in the following sections .",
    "psrchive solves @xmath14 by using a least - squares minimization method for each frequency channel ( see @xcite for more detail ) .",
    "it automatically selects several pulsar pulse phase bins , from pulsar data taken at different parallactic angles , to solve for the model parameters .",
    "the unknown variables are the stokes parameters of the incoming pulsar signals and the jones matrix parameters of the instrument .",
    "because the total flux density @xmath2 of pulsars typically varies on a time - scale of minutes , psrchive normalizes the stokes parameters by the invariant interval @xmath68 instead ( details in @xcite ) .",
    "we can therefore compare pulsar stokes parameters between different scans .",
    "however , the psrchive does not directly assume the circular polarization of the standard candle to be zero .",
    "instead , psrchive provides two options : either assume the @xmath3 of system temperature while directing the telescope to a standard candle , or the @xmath3 of noise diode , to be zero .",
    "following @xcite , who suggests that the circular polarization of a noise diode is significantly different from zero , we choose the first option .    with pulsar observations at five different parallactic angles , we have 20 measurements ( 4 polarizations @xmath69 5 parallactic angles ) at each frequency channel and each selected pulse phase bin .",
    "in addition to the flux calibrator data from quasar observations ( four polarizations ) and the noise diode data ( four polarizations ) , we have 328 measurements for 16 selected pulse phase bins at each frequency channel .",
    "the number of variables at each frequency is 76 , including a total of 64 stokes parameters of the pulsar for the 16 selected pulse phase bins , six stokes parameters of the flux calibrator and noise diode ( the @xmath2 of flux calibrator is assumed to be known , and the @xmath3 of flux calibrator is set to be zero ) , and six instrumental jones / mueller matrix model parameters ( i.e. , the seven parameters describe in section [ sec : model ] except for @xmath70 , which is set to be @xmath71 to break the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "once psrchive obtains the best fit instrumental parameters , it generates both the jones matrix and mueller matrix for each frequency channel with the formalism described in the above section .",
    "figures [ jones_a_b1133 ] and [ fig : jones_p_b1133 ] show the jones matrix obtained from pulsar data , where we took five five - minute tracking scans for pulsar b1133 + 16 in jan , 2014 at different parallactic angles with the gbt . the standard candle used is quasar 3c295 , which is known to be an unpolarized source at 800 mhz .",
    "the model parameters shown in figure [ fig : jones_p_b1133 ] are consistent with the ones shown by @xcite in the overall .",
    "we find that at the gbt , the value of @xmath33 changes dramatically day by day and needs to be determined with each observation ; the values of @xmath28 and @xmath30 are also found to change slightly day by day and significantly several times in a observing semester over six months .",
    "since at the gbt , the noise diode signal is injected into the receiver only after the separation of orthogonal polarizations , parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which describe the cross - talk between orthogonal polarizations , are expected to be negligible for noise diode signal .",
    "the mueller matrix that applies to the noise diode signal can thus be written as eqn .",
    "( [ eq : ncal_mueller ] ) .",
    "one can therefore solve for @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath33 by inserting a known noise diode standard profile @xmath74 and the observed noise diode data @xmath75 into @xmath76 assuming the noise diode frequency profile is stable over a few months , we can use the noise diode data calibrated by psrchive as the standard profile to solve for @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath33 for each observation session .",
    "combining these parameters with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 obtained from multiple parallactic - angle tracking scans of b1133 + 16 , we can achieve @xmath80 accuracy on all the stokes parameters , with respect to total intensity , of the unpolarized quasar 3c147 .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath81 is the rms fluctuation of dozens of calibrated tracking scans on 3c147 over an entire semester .",
    "the calibration method described above is based on the following assumption : the linear polarization fraction , angle , and the circular polarization fraction of the target pulsar are assumed to be stable over the observation period , which is about six hours . to test the first assumption",
    ", we examine the calibrated pulsar properties as a function of time .",
    "figure [ fig : rms_p_f_b1133 ] shows the rms of linear polarization fraction over five calibrated pulsar tracking scans taken in the same night .",
    "we find that the rms fluctuation of the linear polarization fraction measured over multiple parallactic - angle pulsar tracking scans is higher than the thermal noise level .",
    "it appears the polarization fraction of pulsars is not stable enough for our purpose .",
    "the rms fluctuation of the linear polarization angle ( @xmath82-@xmath83 ) and circular polarization fraction ( @xmath84-@xmath85 ) are also larger than acceptable .    because it takes a good amount of observing time ( including overhead ) to conduct multiple parallactic angle pulsar tracking scans , during our hi intensity mapping observing campaign spread over a few semesters",
    ", we only take multiple parallactic - angle pulsar tracking scans once every several months .",
    "the stability of the noise diode profile becomes crucial .",
    "the stability is tested with observations of on- and off - source quasar tracking scans while blinking the thermal noise diode at 15.26 hz in every observing session . comparing data with and without a bright quasar in the center of the beam , and data with and without the noise diode signal",
    ", one can derive @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the injected noise diode temperature in the two polarization directions , given the known spectrum of the quasar .",
    "we find that the noise diode is not stable over a time span of six months either .",
    "figure [ fig : tcal ] shows noise diode temperature measured with scans on 3c48 in 2011 .",
    "there appears to be a discontinuity in noise diode temperature at scan 22 , below which the receptor x has a higher temperature than receptor y but with a 2db attenuation above 840 mhz .",
    "this discontinuity was observed between june 27 , 2011 and july 17 , 2011 , which coincided with the maintenance activity at the gbt when the 800 mhz receiver was taken down from the prime focus .",
    "it is quite possible that the noise diode was reset when the receiver reinstalled .",
    "therefore , we need to modify the method of estimating the jones / mueller matrix for the gbt .      in order to reduce the impact of noise diode instability",
    ", we examine @xmath86 and @xmath87 as a function of time and frequency , derived from quasar tracking scans in each session , then group all sessions into subsets according to the shapes of the derived noise diode frequency profiles . in practice",
    ", the number of identified noise diode profile shapes in each semester varies between 1 to 9 for the five semesters from 2011 to 2015 .",
    "we average the @xmath88 and @xmath89 profiles within each subset to obtain @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 indexes subsets",
    ". then we normalize the profiles to @xmath93 , averaging over all frequency channels .",
    "we further average @xmath94 over all tracking scans within each session to get a normalization factor @xmath95 for each session , where @xmath96 indexes sessions .",

    "( [ eq : m0_ncal ] ) . in order to reduce the impact of errors associated with the estimation of noise diode profiles , we only allow @xmath99 to vary between sessions , and fix the profile shape within each subset .      assuming @xmath100 , to first - order approximation we can calculate the resulting calibration errors induced by errors in values of jones matrix parameters using eqn .",
    "( [ eq : s  ] ) and ( [ eq : rdeltamr ] ) .",
    "the formalism is described in detail in appendix a. figure [ fig : jones_p_b1133 ] suggests that the assumption of small @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 values is sound for the gbt .",
    "we can also define @xmath104 and @xmath105 , for they are directly associate with @xmath4-@xmath3 and @xmath2-@xmath3 leakages , respectively ( see appendix a and @xcite ) .",

    "the 3c295 data calibrated with the modified parameters are shown as green and red dots in figure [ fig : mod_gamma_theta_1 ] .",
    "modification of @xmath30 and @xmath115 dramatically reduce the fluctuation of calibrated @xmath4 and @xmath5 of 3c295 .",
    "this implies the modification of @xmath30 and @xmath115 parameters is a sound approach .    on the other hand , the matrix element @xmath116 in the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : rdeltamr ] ) describes the leakage from @xmath2 into @xmath3 due to @xmath117 .",
    "the circular polarization level of 3c295 is smaller than @xmath0 at our frequency band , thus we assume that the oscillating pattern of @xmath3 of calibrated 3c295 data , which is shown as the blue curve in figure [ fig : mod_eps_minus ] , is caused by @xmath117 in the parameter set we applied .",
    "just as for @xmath112 and @xmath111 , we also use a modified @xmath118 derived from 3c147 data to calibrate 3c295 data .",
    "the corrected @xmath3 of 3c295 is much closer to zero as shown by the green curve in figure [ fig : mod_eps_minus ] .",
    "once we obtain the modified @xmath30 , @xmath115 , and @xmath118 from quasar data , one can apply the solutions to other quasars including 3c48 , 3c295 , 3c147 , and 3c286 .",
    "the rms of calibrated stokes parameters over dozens of tracking scans through an entire observing semester are about @xmath0-@xmath1 of the quasar intensity in most of the frequency channels .",
    "3c286 , a slightly polarized quasar , is taken as an example to illustrate the outcome of the parameter correction , indicated by the blue and green lines in figure [ fig : cal_compare_a ] .",

    "we denote the latter one as @xmath121 because it is the @xmath122 which noise diode signal experienced . as @xmath123 is strong ( @xmath124 of @xmath125 ) , fluctuations in @xmath121 will contribute to the fluctuations in @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , we postulate that the measured @xmath125 is to correlate with the @xmath115 value estimated from quasar data , if the fluctuation of @xmath121 is not negligible .",
    "we therefore correlate fluctuations over time and frequency channels of @xmath125 and @xmath115 obtained from quasar 3c48 taken in 2014 and 2015 .",
    "the most prominent patterns extracted using singular - value decomposition in frequency - time space are removed before correlation .",
    "these removed patterns of @xmath125 and @xmath115 do not correlate with each other . on the other hand , from previous noise diode data , we found that @xmath126 and @xmath127 tend to preserve spectral shape over several nights with normalization changes each night . this kind of pattern matches what we get in the first svd mode .",
    "these two facts imply that these removed modes can be considered to represent fluctuations of @xmath125 and @xmath115 before the light path of sky signal merge with the noise diode signal .",
    "the residual @xmath125 and @xmath115 have a correlation coefficient of @xmath128 , significantly different from @xmath71 . as a sanity check ,",
    "we remove the correlated part from @xmath125 , and find the rms of measured @xmath125 only reduced by @xmath129 of total @xmath125 .",
    "although there is statistically significant correlation between residual @xmath125 and @xmath115 , the impact of this correlation is much smaller than the uncertainty level , @xmath0-@xmath1 , of our calibration .",
    "we perform a similar check on @xmath118 and noise diode @xmath130 , for @xmath117 would results in leakage from @xmath125 into @xmath130 if @xmath117 happens after noise diode signal injecting into the receiver .",

    "we therefore conclude that the cross talk between @xmath126 and @xmath127 is negligible .",
    "ionospheric faraday rotation is another effect that needs to be accounted for in the data .",
    "faraday rotation is the rotation of linear polarization direction when photons propagate through magnetized free electrons .",
    "the angle of rotation is proportional to the wavelength @xmath131 of light as @xmath132 , and can be written as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is rotation measure ( rm ) .",
    "rm can be calculated as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is free electron density , @xmath137 is the strength of magnetic field component parallel to the line of sight , t stands for tesla , the si unit magnetic field strength , and @xmath138 is integrated along the line of sight .",
    "photons from astronomical sources propagate through the terrestrial ionosphere , composed of the free electrons magnetized by the geomagnetic field , the linear polarization angle of light is thus rotated by the faraday effect .",
    "the rm depends on the spatial distribution of @xmath139 , which is a function of time , and the trajectory of light propagation , which is determined by azimuth and elevation of the pointing of the telescope .",
    "we adopt empirical orthonormal functions ( eofs)@xcite and incorporate ionospheric information released by us - tec ( @xcite and @xcite ) to estimate free electron density at the time of observation .",
    "the geomagnetic field is calculated using the international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) @xcite . after applying the free electron number density and geomagnetic field to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : rm ] ) , we obtain the rm values and calculate @xmath140 caused by ionospheric free electrons .",
    "faraday rotation can be corrected by simply adding @xmath140 to the parallactic rotation angle @xmath16 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : rotation ] ) .    with @xmath141 , which is a typical ionospheric @xmath134 value at the gbt site during night time when we observe , @xmath140 is @xmath142 at 900 mhz and @xmath143 at 700 mhz .",
    "the ionospheric faraday rotation affects the linear polarization direction rather significantly in our observing frequency range .",

    ", the @xmath4-@xmath3 relation could be also from errors in the derived mueller matrix parameters .",
    "assuming errors in @xmath174 is the only source of the observed @xmath4-@xmath3 coupling in spider scan data , we estimate @xmath190 from 3c295 spider scan data , and apply the ` corrected ' @xmath174 to spider scan data of other unpolarized sources , including 3c147 and 3c295 .",

    "in this paper , we present the polarization calibration methodology for the gbt hi intensity mapping experiment .",
    "accurate polarization calibration is critical to properly mitigate the unwanted leakage from polarized synchrotron foregrounds into total intensity .",
    "we use multiple parallactic angle pulsar observations to solve for the six jones matrix parameters at boresight in each of the 256 frequency channels between 700 - 900 mhz at the gbt .",
    "applying the solutions to unpolarized quasar observations , the rms fluctuations of the stokes parameters over time are about @xmath81-@xmath214 of total intensity . as a first - order correction , some of the jones matrix parameters",
    "are further modified based on tracking and spider scans of quasars .",
    "the rms fluctuation reduces to @xmath0-@xmath1 of total intensity after the correction .    in section [ sec : pulsar ] we discuss that there are two ways to break the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in psrchive : one assumes @xmath3 to be negligible while observing a standard calibrator , i.e. , the sum of @xmath3 from the astrophysical calibrator , the ( diffuse ) sky , and the system , is negligible . however , the @xmath118 parameter obtained from psrchive under this assumption , which mainly describes the leakage between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , appears to be incorrect .",
    "this assumption does not seem to be valid in our case .",
    "the other approach is to assume the @xmath215 ratio of the noise diode is known .",
    "section [ sec : quv ] and figure [ fig : corr_quv ] suggest that this could be a good assumption . however , psrchive assumes the noise diode signal is injected early in the system so that it shares the same light path as the sky signal ; this is not the case for our gbt 800mhz observations , since the noise diode signal is injected after the omt as discussed in section [ sec : instrument ] .",
    "another explanation for the imperfection might be the variation of polarized pulsar profiles . psr b1133 + 16 , one of the pulsars we use to solve the jones matrix parameters , has been reported to have `` orthogonally polarized modes '' , which may be responsible for the variations in the integrated fractional polarization and position angle of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "the polarized pulse or frequency profiles of pulsars can in general fluctuate due to the astrophysical complexity of the pulse mechanism , or interference of the interstellar medium .",
    "the polarized frequency profiles of quasars are more stable . however , with high fractional linear polarization and non - negligible circular polarization , pulsars provide more information needed to solve for all the jones matrix model parameters than quasars , which are usually slightly or not polarized .",
    "some of the parameters , including @xmath33 , @xmath174 , and @xmath48 , can not be constrained by unpolarized sources .",
    "we can determine @xmath48 by comparing the calibrated polarization position angle of 3c286 with the known value , while @xmath33 can be constrained by a highly polarized noise diode , which is however found to contain an uncertain @xmath215 spectrum .",
    "the @xmath39 parameter is not affected by the noise diode as the signal injection takes place after the dipole receptor in the signal stream at the gbt .",
    "off - centered polarization leakage is also an important source of contamination . with quasar spider scans",
    ", we find a dominant dipole feature in the stokes @xmath2 to @xmath3 leakage pattern , which is at the @xmath216 level , and secondary quadrupole features of stokes @xmath2 to @xmath4 and i to @xmath5 leakage patterns , which are @xmath217 of total intensity . with the leakage of @xmath3 dipole feature into @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we can estimate @xmath218 and @xmath190 , and improve the calibration of polarized sources , like 3c286 . although there are still potential intrinsic dipole features in @xmath4 and @xmath5 beam pattern which have yet to be separated from leakage of @xmath5 .",
    "we find similar features using off - centered pulsar observations and map out the entire mueller matrix primary beam .",
    "however , the stokes @xmath2 to @xmath3 leakage appears to be the only significantly determined beam pattern .",
    "the beam features of @xmath2 leakage to @xmath4 and @xmath5 are comparable to the variation of polarization profile of psr b1133 + 16 .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that we can not significantly measure these features in the pulsar data .    in this paper , we measured the rms fluctuations of calibrated on - source data of quasars , including unpolarized 3c48 , 3c295 , and 3c147 , and slightly polarized 3c286 , to be @xmath219-@xmath1 of the total intensity .",
    "we also mapped the polarization beam pattern .",
    "accurate polarization calibration at this level is required to mitigate the polarized foreground contribution for hi intensity mapping power spectrum measurements .",
    "we will report improvements on the redshifted hi power spectrum in future work .",
    "we will also investigate the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) synthesis of galactic foregrounds in the hi intensity mapping fields .",
    "we thank willem van straten and paul demorest for their invaluable help with the use of psrchive and pulsar calibration with the guppi backend at the gbt .",
