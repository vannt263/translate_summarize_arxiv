    "grow up to several cm in size in the outer disk and ( weakly ) drift toward the star .",
    "the relative behavior of the dust surface density in the three size - bins ( middle panel of figure [ fig : grainsize ] ) illustrates the high coagulation efficiency at disk radii of 10100 au , where @xmath20m - size grains are depleted by coagulation into larger grains .",
    "when icy grains cross the snow line and evaporate , the fragmentation barrier decreases and the smaller silicate grains feel a weaker drift , producing a  traffic - jam \" effect and increasing the dust surface density inside the snow line ( a similar result was found by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , a grain size variation of a factor @xmath48 is produced across the snow line , with cm - size grains outside and sub - mm - size grains inside .",
    "this , in addition to the change in composition from ices to silicates , produces a sharp increase in @xmath1 from 2.5 up to 4 ( figure [ fig : almasim ] ) . because the optical depth at all mm wavelengths is @xmath49 inside the snow line , the high value of @xmath1 is sensitive to the small dust grains in the optically thin regime through @xmath11 as introduced above .    as the value of @xmath29",
    "is decreased ( middle and bottom in figure [ fig : grainsize ] ) , the maximum grain size achievable at any given disk radius and , in turn , the drift efficiency increase .",

    "dust grains up to @xmath50 cm exist due to the efficient coagulation and drift from the outer disk region , increasing the dust surface density by up to a factor 100 as compared to the initial profile .",
    "traffic - jam \" effect is thus made stronger , pushing @xmath1 toward the optically - thick limit of @xmath51 . with @xmath52 ,",
    "the dust emission is so optically thick at all mm wavelengths inside the snow line ( @xmath53 ) that the radial profile of @xmath1 is opposite to the reference model . in this case",
    ", the @xmath1 map shows a broad ring with maximum value of 3.1 beyond the snow line , where the emission is optically thin , reflecting the dominance of small grains due to the efficient drift - loss of cm - size grains from between 10 and 20 au ( middle panel in figure [ fig : grainsize ] ) .",
    "we simulated the model disk images at 1.3 and 3.0 mm ( alma bands 6 and 3 ) using the simulator included in the casa package for alma data reduction , and divided their intensities to obtain a map of the spectral index @xmath54 we consider wavelengths @xmath55 mm to ensure the possibility of low optical depth inside the snow line at least in one band and in one model ( @xmath47 ) ; at shorter wavelengths , the disk emission is optically thick in all models explored .",
    "it is important to obtain alma observations with comparable beam size at both wavelengths in order to avoid artifacts due to the difference in spatial resolutions . for",
    "the sake of demonstration only , all the simulations presented here assume an integration time of 8 hours in each band .    in figure",
    "[ fig : almasim ] , we show @xmath1 maps for the three models , all with a beam size of @xmath56 after deconvolution of the fourier image from the visibilities .",
    "the extended alma array configurations allow to fully resolve the region inward of the snow line ( @xmath57 , using a distance of 125 pc as for the reference disk of hd163296 ) , while still recovering the disk flux over large enough scales ( spatial filtering takes over beyond @xmath58 depending on the band ) . by adopting different weights during synthesis imaging of the data it is possible to maximize sensitivity ( using natural weights ) rather than spatial resolution ( using uniform weights ) . here",
    "we use briggs weights , which provide an intermediate solution and give best results in retrieving the input model profiles .",
    "the azimuthally - averaged spectral index radial profiles shown in figure [ fig : almasim ] demonstrate that the discontinuity at the water snow line can be imaged by alma in all cases , although convolution with the obtained spatial resolution makes all profiles shallower than they really are in the input models . as the disk emission beyond the snow line becomes weaker ( for @xmath2 ) ,",
    "higher noise fluctuations are seen in the alma simulated images beyond @xmath59  au , without compromising the signal at the snow line radius .",
    "in this work , we have modeled the effects of a water snow line on the properties of the dust grain population in a protoplanetary disk , accounting for coagulation , fragmentation , and transport of dust grains during evolution of the disk .",
    "we find a large variation in dust grain sizes as due to the change in fragmentation velocities across the snow line , as originally found by @xcite , where icy grains coagulate more efficiently beyond and dry silicate grains fragment more efficiently inward the snow line .",
    "this produces a sharp discontinuity in the radial profile of the dust emission spectral index @xmath1 that can be observed with alma using the dust continuum emission measured in two bands .",
    "we find this effect persistent through the range of disk and dust grains parameters that are currently considered canonical .",
    "we propose that alma images of disks should be found to commonly show the water snow line , when the necessary spatial resolution is achieved .    since the maximum grain size and therefore the drift efficiency depend on the disk viscosity",
    ", we have explored the effects of assuming different @xmath29 values .",
    "essentially , the models shown in figures [ fig : grainsize ] and [ fig : almasim ] illustrate how the snow line would be imaged when the emission is optically thin or thick in both bands . from the observational point of view",
    ", these extreme cases are expected to apply broadly to the range of conditions that protoplanetary disks may provide during their evolution from thick to thin inner disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in terms of directly imaging the radius of the water snow line using alma ,",
    "our simulations show a range of situations .",
    "the easiest case to interpret is the model with @xmath47 , where the snow line is unambiguously located by a inner disk region of high spectral index values . in this case , the optically thin emission in both bands is sensitive to the grain properties through their opacity , and @xmath1 increases as driven by the higher @xmath11 from the small grains .",
    "however , our modeling shows that when the disk viscosity is lower ( @xmath60 ) the region inward of the snow line becomes more optically thick due to increasing dust surface densities driven by the efficient radial drift . in this case , the snow line would be seen as a ring in the radial profile of the spectral index , with a central region of @xmath61 where the emission becomes optically thick in both bands .",
    "somewhat similar ring - like features may be produced by disk - carving protoplanets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may require detailed modeling of both dust and gas surface densities to distinguish between the competing scenarios .     overplotted to the radial profile of the spectral index between 0.87 and 1.3 mm as measured in hl tau using alma ( grey - shaded area , * ? ? ?",

    "a snow line interpretation of these rings has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "they argued that each ring may correspond to the condensation front of a different molecule , with water producing the ring at @xmath62au .",
    "figure [ fig : hltau ] compares the spectral index profile from our @xmath52 model to the profile measured in hltau .",
    "the model does produce a qualitatively similar trend of @xmath63 inside the snow line and higher outside , but the model ring is broader than those in hltau .",
    "a narrower ring is produced in our model by using a higher midplane temperature profile , as used in @xcite  k from @xcite . ] .",
    "this happens because a higher temperature increases the dust drift velocities and lowers the maximum grain sizes , as @xmath64 in eqn.[eqn : a_max ] @xcite . within a snow line interpretation ,",
    "our model would suggest a disk viscosity as low as @xmath60 ; this would be consistent with results from the detailed radiative transfer modeling of hltau by @xcite .",
    "however , simple estimates by @xcite using the alma data provide a temperature profile that is @xmath51 times lower than that used by @xcite , and the water snow line in hltau may in fact yet be undiscovered in the unresolved region at @xmath65  au .",
    "it is yet also unclear whether a significant variation in fragmentation velocity may be produced by other ices , to test within our model the interpretation that all @xmath1 rings observed in hltau may be linked to snow lines @xcite rather than planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
