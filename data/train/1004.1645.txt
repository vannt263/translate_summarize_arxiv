    "notably , in order to achieve universality , ancillary qubits are not required .",
    "the approaches used in @xcite and @xcite are similar in many respects and build upon the lie - algebraic approach of divincenzo @xcite . neither approach is constructive and both analyses revolve around the lie algebra generated by @xmath0 and @xmath34 , where @xmath0 is a hamiltonian corresponding to a generic unitary and @xmath35 is the gate exchanging the two qubits ( recall equation  ( [ eq : t1 ] ) ) .",

    "@xcite provides a more complete proof .",
    "our work builds upon some of the techniques described in ref .",
    "unfortunately , the arguments of that paper have some shortcomings :    1 .",
    "the goal of @xcite is to establish the universality of a generic unitary @xmath63 .",
    "the argument begins by replacing @xmath24 with a `` hamiltonian @xmath0 generating @xmath24 , '' defined as a solution to @xmath64",
    ". however , there can be different solutions generating different lie algebras . as a simple example , both @xmath65 generate @xmath66 , while only @xmath67 can be used to approximate some non - identity evolutions .",
    "thus one should give either a prescription for the choice of the generating hamiltonian or a proof that different choices generically have the same power , but neither was provided in @xcite .",
    "2 .   the argument makes use of the fact that any gate @xmath68 given by ( [ eq : barenco ] ) is universal",
    ". however , such gates are only universal _ with ancillae _ ( because @xmath69 is a fixed - point of both @xmath68 and @xmath70 , so composing them can not approximate any @xmath63 that does not fix @xmath69 ) , yet the final result claims universality without the need for ancillae .",
    "3 .   the argument proceeds by considering a hamiltonian @xmath71 that generates the gate @xmath68 .",
    "the authors claim that @xmath71 is universal due to the linear independence of the following 16 nested commutators of @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73,\\quad j\\in{\\left\\{3,\\dotsc,14\\right\\}},\\\\    h_{15 } & { \\colonequals}i[h_2,h_3],\\\\    h_{16 } & { \\colonequals}i[h_2,h_5 ] , \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : scheme}\\ ] ] + however , as in item 1 , the claim may or may not hold depending on the choice of the hamiltonian @xmath71 generating @xmath68 .",
    "in fact , the most natural choice , @xmath74 does not generate @xmath4 since the entire lie algebra fixes @xmath69 . however , there are other choices of @xmath71 for which @xmath75 are linearly independent . for example , if one chooses @xmath71 to act diagonally in a random basis on the degenerate @xmath76-eigenspace of @xmath68 , with eigenvalues @xmath77 and @xmath78 , then @xmath75 are found to be linearly independent in a numerical experiment .",
    "+ for any explicit hamiltonian @xmath0 , it is simple to generate the @xmath79 matrices according to ( [ eq : scheme ] ) and their linear dependence is easily checked .",
    "if these @xmath79 matrices are linearly independent , then we say that ( [ eq : scheme ] ) certifies the universality of @xmath0 .",
    "4 .   to show that almost any unitary gate is universal , non - universal gates",
    "are argued to lie in a submanifold of @xmath33 of at most 15 dimensions .",
    "the argument begins by considering a one - parameter family of hamiltonians @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath0 is arbitrary , and @xmath82 is a fixed hamiltonian whose universality is certified by ( [ eq : scheme ] ) . then , unless @xmath39 is a root of a certain polynomial of finite degree , ( [ eq : scheme ] ) also certifies the universality of @xmath83 .",
    "this argument is claimed to extend to a 16-dimensional neighborhood of @xmath0 ( which could be parametrized as @xmath84 ) .",
    "however , the explicit analysis of the relevant multivariate polynomial is omitted .",
    "furthermore , the argument requires that ( [ eq : scheme ] ) certifies the universality of each of @xmath85 , but this is not demonstrated , and it is unclear to us whether it actually holds for some choice of @xmath71 .",
    "reference @xcite also conjectures that a 2-qubit unitary gate is non - universal if and only if it    1 .",
    "[ item : permute ] permutes states of some orthonormal basis or 2 .",
    "[ item : local ] is a tensor product of single - qubit unitary gates .",
    "we note that a unitary gate @xmath24 satisfying item  [ item : permute ] need not be non - universal , because @xmath24 and @xmath86 may not permute the same basis .",
    "we presume that the authors of  @xcite intended to require that _ both _ @xmath24 and @xmath86 permute states of the same orthonormal basis .    in theorem  [ thm:2nonuniversal ] of this paper",
    ", we disprove the above conjecture and give a complete characterization of the set of non - universal 2-qubit hamiltonians , thereby resolving a variant of the above question .",
    "the first step in our quest for a simple closed - form characterization of universal hamiltonians is a characterization of universality in terms of lie algebras , just as in @xcite .",
    "[ def : liealgebra ] we write @xmath87 to denote the _ lie algebra generated by hamiltonians @xmath88_. it is defined inductively by the following three rules :    1 .",

    "the set of evolutions that can be simulated using a set of hamiltonians is given by the following lemma :    [ lem : lie ] assume that we can evolve according to hamiltonians @xmath93 for any desired amount of time .",
    "then we can simulate the unitary @xmath24 if and only if @xmath94 where `` @xmath95 '' denotes the closure of a set .. we can use @xmath0 to simulate any diagonal @xmath96 unitary but there are diagonal unitary matrices such as @xmath97 that are not of the form @xmath98 for @xmath99 . ]",
    "one can easily prove the above lemma using the lie product formula , the analogous formula for @xmath100}$ ] , and the campbell - baker - hausdorff formula  @xcite .",
    "now we can obtain a simpler and more practical sufficient condition for @xmath1-universality than the original one from definition  [ def : universal ] .",

    "now we proceed to show that if a hamiltonian @xmath0 is n - universal then it is also n-universal for all @xmath107 .",

    "since @xmath0 is n - universal for some @xmath108 , it can be used to simulate all unitary transformations in @xmath110 that act non - trivially on no more than two qubits .",
    "but any unitary gate on @xmath111 qubits can be decomposed into gates that act only on one or two qubits without the need for ancillae @xcite , so @xmath0 is n-universal .",
    "in this section we classify the set of 2-qubit hamiltonians that are _ not _ 2-universal .",
    "since we only consider 2-universality , we simply say that a hamiltonian is universal ( instead of `` 2-universal '' ) or ( instead of `` not 2-universal '' ) for the remainder of this section .",
    "our analysis relies on an equivalence relation that partitions the set of all 2-qubit hamiltonians into equivalence classes , each containing only universal or non - universal hamiltonians ( but not both ) .",
