    "one of the important developments in our understanding of galactic nuclei has been the realization that stars are intimately involved in the dynamics of accretion discs .",
    "direct evidence for this comes from observations of sgr @xmath0 , where three - dimensional stellar orbits are determined within @xmath1 cm of the compact radio source with no preferred orientation @xcite .",
    "these observations lend support to the notion that stars can actually be formed from accreting gas in a disc .",
    "this realization leads to consideration of the dynamical interaction between stars and discsand the observable consequences of this interaction .",
    "the passage of a star through an accretion disc has been the focus of many studies .",
    "stars can influence the disc by imposing a drag and removing its angular momentum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and depositing mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of the stellar orbits can be altered by the disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that each passage through a disc results in the appearance of a bright hot spot on the disc s surface .",
    "@xcite related this passage to a uv bump superimposed upon the continuum spectrum emitted by an optically thick disc .",
    "@xcite showed that star - disc collisions can leave  star tails \" above the disc and produce broad line emission .",
    "@xcite used the passage to explain a large magnitude and short duration x - ray flare at the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "however , a bound star will pass many times through a disc , each passage leading to a flare , as shown in fig .",

    "the timing of these flares can therefore be a measure of the elements of the stellar orbit and , when the orbit is relativistic , it can provide a probe of strong - field gravity . in this paper",
    ", we consider what information could , in principle , be derived from careful observations of a single star in an individual relativistic orbit about a black hole and its attendant disc .    in classical mechanics ,",
    "when a star orbits a massive black hole , the stellar trajectory is a bound ellipse with the position of the heavier object at the focus .",
    "however , in the strong gravitational potential well of black hole , a star s trajectory will be more complicated .",
    "the three - dimensional orientation of each stellar orbit differs due to two general relativity effects .",
    "first , the peribothon , or closest approach to the hole , precesses on the orbital plane .",
    "second , if the black hole is spinning , due to the dragging of inertial frames , the orbital plane itself will precess about the spin of the hole ; henceforth , the orbit becomes even more complex ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the propagation of photons from the accretion disc around black holes has been well studied using semi - analytical methods and direct numerical methods by many people ( see for example , @xcite , and references therein ) .    combining the stellar trajectory , the star - disc collision model , and ray - tracing the photons from the flares",
    ", the time behavior and flux of the flares caused by star - disc collision can be modelled .",
    "these signals exhibit quasi - periodicity for two reasons : ( 1 ) due to the precession of a stellar orbit , intrinsic time separations between two consecutive star - disc collisions are different , and ( 2 ) because the star hits the accretion disc at different ( @xmath2 ) coordinates on the equatorial plane each time , the light - crossing time for the signals is also different .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we give the assumptions and methodology , describe the stellar trajectories , construct our collision model , and discuss the method of ray - tracing . in section 3 , we present simulated results for the quasi - periodic signals , showing in detail how the quasi - periodicity depends on the parameters of the black hole and the star s orbit . in section 4 , we discuss the possibility and method of extracting useful information from the signals . in section 5",

    "the mass of the hole and the size of the stellar orbit need to satisfy different conditions in order to observe general relativistic features of the stellar orbit around the smbh : e.g. produce enough flares in reasonable observing time , reveal the eccentricity through the apsidal motion , reveal the spin through the lense - thirring effect , have a gravitationally stable stellar orbit , and avoid tidal disruption .",

    "thus , the problem of calculating the radiated energy is transformed to calculating the size of the collision area in the disc rest frame .    here",
    "we assume that space - time is flat locally .",
    "the shape of the star in its rest frame is a sphere in 3-d space , ignoring the effect of gravity exerted by the central black hole and rotation . in flat space - time , the major and minor axes of this ellipse are simply @xmath69 and @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the angle between the normal vector of the plane and the velocity of the star in the rest frame of the gas in the disc .",

    "these two obviously become degenerate for circular orbits .",
    "the spin and the inclination are coupled by the lense - thirring effect , and if the black hole does not spin , the orbital inclination is not measurable .    if the peribothon is midway between two hits , the energy released in successive collisions will be similar",
    ". however , due to our assumption of isotropic emission in the star s frame , if the star is approaching the observer in a collision , the observed collision will be brighter due to doppler boosting .",
