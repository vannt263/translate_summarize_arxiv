    "it is known that one - dimensional driven diffusive systems can exhibit many interesting collective phenomena such as jamming and spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "applications of such models are divers and include the kinetics of biopolymerization @xcite and traffic flow @xcite , but to give just a few examples .",
    "+ a powerful framework for studying equilibrium phase transitions in classical statistical mechanics is the yang - lee theory of phase transition @xcite . here",
    "we shall briefly explain the key points of this theory .",
    "consider a simple model consisting of @xmath0 spins in thermal contact with a heat reservoir .",
    "the hallmark of a phase transition in this system is the appearance of nonanalyticities in its free energy which can be defined in terms of the partition function of the system @xmath1 as @xmath2 . in the thermal equilibrium",
    "the partition function ( which is a function of temperature @xmath3 in our example ) determines the statistical properties of the system .",
    "however , since the partition function has no real and positive zeros in the complex-@xmath3 plane , there is no scope for a phase transition in a finite system .",
    "as we increase the number of spins @xmath0 to infinity , the partition function zeros might accumulate towards a point @xmath4 on the real axis so there is the possibility of a phase transition at this point .",
    "the density of zeros near the accumulation point determines the order of the phase transition . at a first - order phase transition",
    "there is a nonzero density of zeros at the critical point whereas the density of zeros decays to zero at a continuous transition .",
    "although we explained the theory of partition function zeros with reference to a system described by a canonical partition function , we should note that the theory still holds when one is working in grand canonical ensembles . in this case",
    "the fugacity ( or chemical potential ) plays similar role as the temperature @xmath3 .",
    "more generally one can look for the zeros of the partition function in the complex plane of any of its intensive variables @xcite .",
    "+ the lack of such a theory in the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics context has recently encouraged people to examine whether a generalized version of it can still work for out - of - equilibrium systems . quite similar to the equilibrium statistical mechanics one can define a generalized partition function as sum over the steady state weights .",
    "these weights can be calculated using different methods such as matrix product formalism in which the stationary probability distribution function is written in terms of the products of non - commuting operators @xcite .",
    "then we look at the zeros of the partition function in the thermodynamic limit in the complex plane of any intensive variable of the model .",
    "the zeros might divide the complex plane into several regions where the free energy of the system is analytic .",
    "each region corresponds to a different phase and as we explained above , the order of transition depends on how the zeros accumulate towards the positive real axis . several out of equilibrium models have been proposed and studied using the generalized version of the yang - lee theory @xcite-@xcite , and it seems that the results obtained from application of this theory accord themselves well with the known results obtained from other approaches .",
    "+ in this paper we will introduce a one - dimensional reaction - diffusion model with open boundary and apply the yang - lee theory thereto .",
    "this model has already been studied with reflecting boundaries @xcite while the open boundary problem has not been solved .",
    "we shall investigate the effects of the open boundary condition on the phase diagram and also the phase transition points of this model .",
    "our work will also be another example ( with more complicated reaction rules ) that shows the applicability of the yang - lee theory to study the critical behaviors of the out of equilibrium systems .",
    "+ in chapter ( 2 ) we define the model . the chapter ( 3 ) is devoted to the application of the matrix product formalism in order to find the steady states weights and therefore the partition function of the model .",
    "using this formalism allows us to find the stationary weights of the model exactly and calculate many interesting quantities such as the density profile of particles on the chain and also the correlation functions .",
    "it turns out that our model has a first - order phase transition between a low - density and a high - density phase provided that there is a constraint on the reaction rates . in chapter ( 4 )",
    "we shall apply the yang - lee theory to our model and calculate the grand canonical partition function of the system and its line of zeros in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the line of zeros is a circle and the density of zeros is constant over it all . in the yang - lee theory language",
    "this signifies a first - order phase transition .",
    "finally in section ( 5 ) we shall conclude and explain the generalizations .",

    "when two of them meet , they can merge into a single particle .",
    "similarly , a single particle can split into two particles .",
    "all of these processes take place preferentially to the leftward direction . specifically , the reaction rules in the bulk of the chain are @xmath7 in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent an occupied and an empty site respectively . at the left boundary we have @xmath10",
    "it is seen that ( [ p1 ] ) consists of transitions which involve only the configurations of nearest neighboring sites . for @xmath11",
