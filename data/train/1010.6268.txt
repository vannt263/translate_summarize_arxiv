    "recent observations like type ia supernova ( sn ia ) @xcite@xmath0@xcite , cmb anisotropy @xcite , and large scale structure @xcite strongly indicate that our universe is spatially flat and there exists an exotic cosmic fluid called dark energy ( de ) with negative pressure , which constitutes about 70 percent of the total energy of universe .",
    "it is an irony of the nature and is a puzzling phenomenon that most abundant form of matter - energy in the universe is most mysterious .",
    "many cosmologists believe that the simplest candidate for the de is the cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) or vacuum energy since it fits the observational data well . during the cosmological evolution",
    ", the @xmath1-term has the constant energy density and pressure @xmath2 .",
    "however , one has the reason to dislike the cosmological constant since it always suffers from the theoretical problems such as the  fine - tuning \" and  cosmic coincidence \" puzzles @xcite .",
    "that is why , the different forms of dynamically changing de with an effective equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath3 , have been proposed in the literature .",
    "other possible forms of de include quintessence ( @xmath4)@xcite , phantom ( @xmath5 ) @xcite etc . while the possibility @xmath6 is ruled out by current cosmological data from sne ia ( supernovae legacy survey , gold sample of hubble space telescope ) @xcite , cmbr ( wmap , boomerang ) @xcite and large scale structure ( sloan digital sky survey ) @xcite data , the dynamically evolving de crossing the phantom divide line ( pdl ) @xmath7 is mildly favored .",
    "some other limits obtained from the observational results coming from sn ia data ( knop et al @xcite ) collaborated with cmbr anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics ( tegmark et al @xcite ) are @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .    following berman @xcite and kumar and singh @xcite , recently singh et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a special law of variation for the average hubble s parameter in bianchi - v space - time , which yields a constant value of deceleration parameter .",
    "such a law of variation for hubble s parameter is not inconsistent with the observations and is also approximately valid for slowly time - varying dp models .",
    "the law provides explicit forms of scale factors governing the bianchi - v universe and facilitates to describe accelerating as well as decelerating modes of evolution of the universe .",
    "models with constant dp have been extensively studied in the literature in different contexts ( see , kumar and singh @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of the models with constant dp have been studied by considering perfect fluid or ordinary matter in the universe .",
    "but the ordinary matter is not enough to describe the dynamics of an accelerating universe .",
    "this motivates the researchers to consider the models of the universe filled with some exotic matter such as the de along with the usual perfect fluid .",
    "akarsu and kilinc @xcite@xmath0@xcite have investigated bianchi - i and bianchi - iii de models with constant dp .",
    "yadav and yadav @xcite have studied the role of de with variable eos in bianchi type - iii universe evolving with constant dp .",
    "kumar @xcite has studied some isotropic and anisotropic models of accelerating universe with de and constant dp .",
    "recently , yadav et al @xcite has presented lrs bianchi - v universe with de characterized by variable eos assuming constant dp .    in this paper , we have considered minimally interacting perfect fluid and de energy components with constant dp within the framework of a bianchi - v space - time in general relativity . the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the models and field equations have been presented .",
    "the section 3 deals with the exact solutions of the field equations and physical behavior of the models .",
    "finally , the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the spatially homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi - v space - time is described by the line element @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the metric functions of cosmic time @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "we define @xmath16 as the average scale factor of the space - time ( [ eq1 ] ) so that the average hubble s parameter reads as @xmath17 where an over dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath14 .",
    "the einstein s field equations in case of a mixture of perfect fluid and de components , in the units @xmath18 , read as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the overall energy momentum tensor with @xmath21 and @xmath22 as the energy momentum tensors of ordinary matter and de , respectively .",
    "these are given by @xmath23\\\\                     = diag[-1,\\omega^{(m)},\\omega^{(m)},\\omega^{(m)}]\\rho^{(m)}\\ ] ] and @xmath24\\\\                     = diag[-1,\\omega^{(de)},\\omega^{(de)},\\omega^{(de)}]\\rho^{(de)}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are , respectively the energy density and pressure of the perfect fluid component or ordinary baryonic matter while @xmath27 is its eos parameter .",
    "similarly , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively the energy density and pressure of the de component while @xmath30 is the corresponding eos parameter .    in a comoving coordinate system , the field equations ( [ eq3 ] ) , for the bianchi - i space - time ( [ eq1 ] ) , in case of ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , read as @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 the energy conservation equation @xmath36 yields @xmath37",
    "integrating ( [ eq10 ] ) and absorbing the constant of integration in @xmath12 or @xmath13 , without loss of generality , we obtain @xmath38    subtracting ( [ eq6 ] ) from ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) from ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) from ( [ eq8 ] ) and taking second integral of each , we get the following three relations respectively : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constants of integration .    from equations",
    "( [ eq13])-([eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) , the metric functions can be explicitly written as @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51{d_{2 } d_{3 } } , ~~   l = \\frac{(x_{2 } + x_{3 } ) } { 3 } \\nonumber\\ ] ] with @xmath52    in order to solve the field equations completely , first we assume that the perfect fluid and de components interact minimally . therefore , the energy momentum tensors of the two sources may be conserved separately .",
    "the energy conservation equation @xmath53 , of the perfect fluid leads to @xmath54 whereas the energy conservation equation @xmath55 , of the de component yields @xmath56    following akarsu and kilinc @xcite , we assume that the eos parameter of the perfect fluid to be a constant , that is , @xmath57 while @xmath58 has been allowed to be a function of time since the current cosmological data from snia , cmb and large scale structures mildly favor dynamically evolving de crossing the pdl as discussed in section 1 .",
    "now integration of equation ( [ eq20 ] ) leads to @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a positive constant of integration .    finally , we constrain the system of equations with a law of variation for the average hubble parameter in bianchi - v space - time proposed by singh et al .",
    "@xcite , which yields a constant value of dp .",
    "the law reads as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants . in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss the de cosmology for @xmath64 and @xmath65 by using the law ( [ eq24 ] ) .      in this case ,",
    "integration of ( [ eq24 ] ) leads to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant of integration .    inserting ( [ eq25 ] ) into ( [ eq16])-([eq18 ] )",
    ", we get @xmath69 @xmath70 , \\ ] ] @xmath71 , \\ ] ]    provided @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the model ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the average hubble s parameter ( @xmath76 ) , energy density ( @xmath25 ) of perfect fluid , de density ( @xmath28 ) and eos parameter ( @xmath58 ) of de , for the model ( [ eq29 ] ) are found to be @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80    the above solutions satisfy the equation ( [ eq29 ] ) identically , as expected .",
    "the spatial volume ( @xmath81 ) and expansion scalar @xmath82 of the model read as @xmath83 @xmath84    the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath85 ) and shear scalar @xmath86 of the model are given by @xmath87 = \\frac{2l^{2}}{3d^{2}}(ndt+c_{1})^{-\\frac{2(3-n)}{n}},\\ ] ] @xmath88 the value of dp ( @xmath89 ) is found to be @xmath90 which is a constant .",
    "the sign of @xmath89 indicates whether the model inflates or not .",
    "a positive sign of @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath91 corresponds to the standard decelerating model whereas the negative sign of @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath92 indicates inflation .",
    "the expansion of the universe at a constant rate corresponds to @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "also , recent observations of sn ia @xcite@xmath0@xcite reveal that the present universe is accelerating and value of dp lies somewhere in the range @xmath95 it follows that in the derived model , one can choose the values of dp consistent with the observations .",

    "therefore , the model has a big bang singularity at @xmath103 , which can be shifted to @xmath104 by choosing @xmath105 .",
    "the singularity is point type as the directional scale factors @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 vanish at the initial moment .    *",
    "fig.1 * shows that the directional scale factors monotonically increase with time .",
    "thus , expansion of the universe takes place in all the three spatial directions .    from * fig . 2 * and * fig .",
    "3 * , we observe that @xmath25 as well as @xmath28 remain positive during the cosmic evolution .",
    "therefore , the weak energy condition ( wec ) as well as null energy condition ( nec ) are obeyed in the derived model .",
    "further , @xmath25 and @xmath28 decrease with time , and approach to small positive values at the present epoch .    the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 start off with extremely large values , and continue to decrease with the expansion of the universe .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath85 also decreases with the cosmic evolution provided @xmath111 .",
    "this shows that anisotropy of the model goes off during the cosmic evolution .",
    "the spatial volume grows with the cosmic time .    , @xmath112 , @xmath97 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102.,height=6 ]    , @xmath113 , @xmath98 , @xmath100 , @xmath114 , @xmath101 , @xmath102.,height=6 ]    * fig .",
    "4 * depicts the variation of eos parameter @xmath115 versus cosmic time for accelerating phase of universe ( @xmath116 ) , as a representative case with appropriate choice of constants of integration and other physical parameters .",
    "the sn ia data suggests that @xmath8 @xcite while the limit imposed on @xmath58 by a combination of sn ia data ( with cmb anisotropy ) and galaxy clustering statistics is @xmath9 @xcite . *",
    ", clearly shows that @xmath58 evolves within a range , which is in nice agreement with sn ia and cmb observations .",
    "the perfect fluid density parameter @xmath117 and de density parameter @xmath118 are given by @xmath119 @xmath120    the overall density parameter @xmath121 is given by @xmath122    from equation @xmath123 , it is observed that for @xmath124 , the overall density parameter @xmath121 approaches to 1 at late times .",
    "thus , the derived model predicts a flat universe at the present epoch . *",
    "fig . 5 * , depicts the variation of density parameters versus cosmic time during the evolution of universe .",
    "it is observed that initially universe was matter dominated and later on de dominates the evolution of universe which is probably responsible for the accelerated expansion of present - day universe .      in this case ,",
    "integration of ( [ eq24 ] ) yields @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a positive constant of integration .",
    "the metric functions , therefore , read as @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 therefore , the model ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "the average hubble s parameter , energy density of perfect fluid , de density and eos parameter of de , for the model ( [ eq46 ] ) are obtained as @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135",
    "the above solutions satisfy the equation ( [ eq46 ] ) identically , as expected .",
    "the spatial volume and expansion scalar of the model read as @xmath136 @xmath137    the dp is given by @xmath138    the perfect fluid density parameter and de density parameter are given by @xmath139 @xmath140    the overall density parameter reads as @xmath141    the anisotropic parameter and shear scalar of model ( [ eq46 ] ) are given by @xmath142 @xmath143    recent observations of sn ia @xcite@xmath0@xcite , suggest that the universe is accelerating in its present state of evolution .",
    "it is believed that the way universe is accelerating presently ; it will expand at the fastest possible rate in future and forever . for @xmath65 , we get * @xmath144 * ; incidentally this value of dp leads to @xmath145 , which implies the greatest value of hubble s parameter and the fastest rate of expansion of the universe .",
    "therefore , the derived model can be utilized to describe the dynamics of the late time evolution of the actual universe .",
    "so , in what follows , we emphasize upon the late time behavior of the derived model .    from equation ( [ eq50 ] )",
    ", we observe that @xmath146 for sufficiently large time @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the late time dynamics of eos parameter @xmath58 represents the vacuum fluid dominated universe , which is mathematically equivalent to cosmological constant .",
    "further , at late times , we have + @xmath147 , + @xmath148 , + @xmath149 .",
    "+ thus , the ordinary matter density becomes negligible whereas the accelerated expansion of universe continues with non - zero and constant de density , which is consistent with recent observations .",
    "also the late time dynamics of the derived model shows that the anisotropy of the universe damps out and universe becomes isotropic . from equation ( [ eq56 ] )",
    ", it is observed that for sufficiently large time , the overall density parameter approaches to 1 , i.e. , @xmath150 .",
    "thus , the model predicts a flat universe .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the role of de with variable eos parameter in the evolution of universe within the framework of a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi - v space - time by taking into account the special law of variation of average hubble parameter , which yields a constant value of dp .",
    "the main features of the work are as follows :    * the models are based on exact solutions of the field equations . * in the present models , the matter energy density and de density remain positive",
    ". therefore , the weak and null energy conditions are satisfied , which in turn imply that the derived models are physically realistic . *",
    "the singular model ( @xmath66 ) seems to describe the dynamics of universe from big bang to the present epoch while the non - singular model ( @xmath65 ) seems reasonable to project dynamics of future universe . * the age of universe , in the singular model , is given by @xmath151 which differs from the present estimate , i.e. , @xmath152 .",
    "but if we take @xmath153 , the model @xmath154 is in good agreement with the present age of universe . *",
    "the eos parameter of de evolves within the range predicted by the observations .",
    "* the de dominates the universe at the present epoch , which may be attributed to the current accelerated expansion of the universe . *",
    "the universe acquires flatness with the dominance of de ( see , * fig.5 * ) .",
    "thus , flatness of the universe seems a natural consequence of de .",
    "hypothetical de is the most popular way of explaining why the universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate .",
    "de plays a massive part in shaping our reality however nobody seems certain of what the dang stuff actually is .",
    "future space missions hope to solve this mystery and shake up our current understanding of the universe .    000 s. perlmutter",
