    "after the discovery of the higgs boson by the atlas and the cms experiments at the lhc  @xcite , the investigation of the properties of the higgs boson has become an important target of study in particle physics . in the standard model ( sm ) , the coupling of the higgs boson to the matter fermions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the yukawa couplings , is proportional to the fermion mass .",
    "the yukawa couplings can deviate from the sm prediction in the presence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "recent studies indicate that the deviations from the sm could be at the few - percent level if there is new physics at the scale of around 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desired to measure the higgs couplings as precisely as possible in order to probe new physics .    in this study , we focus on higgs boson decays into tau lepton pairs ( @xmath1 ) at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "this decay has been studied by the atlas and the cms experiments , who reported a combined signal yield consistent with the sm expectation , with a combined observed significance at the level of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this study is to estimate the projected ilc capabilities of measuring the @xmath1 decay mode in final states resulting from the main higgs boson production mechanisms in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "existing studies on @xmath1 decays at @xmath3 collisions  @xcite did not take into account some of the relevant background processes or were based on a higgs boson mass hypothesis which differs from the observed value , both of which are addressed in this study .",
    "we assume the ilc capabilities for the accelerator and the detector as documented in the ilc technical design report ( tdr )  @xcite together with its running scenario published recently  @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper will be useful for future phenomenological studies .",
    "the contents of this paper are organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the ilc and the ild detector concept , and the analysis setup .",
    "the event reconstruction and selection at center - of - mass energies of 250 gev and 500 gev are discussed in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "section 5 describes the prospects for improving the measurement precision with various ilc running scenarios .",
    "we summarize our results in section 6 .",
    "the ilc is a next - generation electron  positron linear collider .",
    "it covers a center - of - mass energy ( @xmath4 ) in the range of 250500 gev and can be extended to @xmath5  tev . in the ilc design , both",
    "the electron and positron beams can be polarized , which allow precise measurements of the properties of the electroweak interaction .",
    "the details of the machine design are summarized in the ilc technical design report ( tdr )  @xcite .",
    "the ilc aims to explore physics beyond the sm via precise measurements of the higgs boson and the top quark as well as to search for new particles within its energy reach .",

    "the systematic uncertainty in the luminosity measurement has been estimated to be 0.1% or better for the ilc  @xcite and is not expected to be a significant source of systematic errors .",
    "the uncertainties in the selection criteria , such as those caused by the uncertainty in the momentum / energy resolutions and tracking efficiencies , are not included in this analysis , since they are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have evaluated the measurement precision of the higgs boson production cross section times the branching ratio of decay into tau leptons at the ilc .",
    "the study is based on the full detector simulation of the ild model .",
    "the dominant higgs boson production mechanisms were studied at the center - of - mass energies of 250 gev and 500 gev , assuming the nominal luminosity scenario presented in the ilc tdr .",
    "the analysis results are then scaled up to the running scenarios taking into account realistic running periods and a possible luminosity upgrade .",
    "the results for the various modes and scenarios are summarized in table  [ summarytable ] . in short , the cross section times",
    "the branching ratio can be measured with a statistical precision of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the nominal and full running scenarios , respectively .",
    "we evaluate the statistical precision of @xmath9 to be 3.6% for the nominal tdr integrated luminosity and 1.4% for the full running scenario , respectively .",
    "these results serve to provide primary information on the expected precision of measuring higgs decays to tau leptons at the ilc , which will be useful for future phenomenological studies on physics beyond the sm .",
