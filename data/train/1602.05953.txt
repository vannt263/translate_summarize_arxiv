    "flexibility is a key point in the functioning of macromolecules such as proteins @xcite .",
    "one of the few techniques which permit to extract information about the conformational freedom of proteins in physiological condition is nmr spectroscopy . in the last decade",
    "a vast literature has flourished on this topic , we refer the reader to the two recent review papers @xcite for a general discussion on the available techniques .    since the temporal scale of the fluctuations in the fold of a protein is several orders smaller than the time needed to take nmr measurements @xcite , information about the flexibility can be only be recovered as a probability function on the set of allowed states .",
    "this set can be parametrized using for instance cartesian coordinates of atoms involving measurements , dihedral angles of the backbone or euler transformations determining the position of rigid protein domains .",
    "the recovery of this probability distribution is an under - determined ill - posed problem independently of the chosen parameters .",
    "the number of constraints is in fact far too small to determine a unique solution , except in trivial cases . without further assumptions , any set of values of the parameters which is compatible with the measurements",
    "may be seen as a solution , and in principle there is no way of telling if a solution is better than another .",
    "the lack of uniqueness , combined with the heterogeneity of the nmr measurement scenarios , led to a plethora of different techniques with different acronyms all trying to determine the _ `` best '' _ solution .",
    "the two cited review papers try to classify ( each from a different point of view ) these approaches .",
    "from the mathematical point of view it may be observed that there are two limit cases for the solutions .",
    "@xmath0 a first approach is to find the solution which minimizes the additional hypotheses on the data , thus using either the maximum entropy principle ( mep ) @xcite , or the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite , which is the relative entropy .",
    "the mep solution maximizes the uncertainty on the data , so each feature shown by the mep solution is relevant . on the other hand",
    "the mep solution is in general a continuous probability distribution , so that a large number of states is normally needed in order to approximate it @xcite .",
    "the large number of variables involved raises not easy computational issues .",
    "@xmath0 a second approach is to find if the measurements carry some preference for certain states .",
    "the maximal allowable probability ( map ) is the largest weight of a given state in a probability distribution which is a solution . as a function of the state",
    ", the map is not a solution but a sharp bound from above .",
    "the zones with a large map are the positions favoured by the data . on the other hand",
    "it is not possible to establish to what extent the true distribution shows these asymmetries .",
    "we can only say that the largest asymmetries should be in favour of the zones indicated by the map technique .",
    "both approaches are equally able to recover the unknown probability distribution in the extremal cases . when there is very little conformational freedom the physical situation can be thought as a series of oscillations around a central state . in this case",
    "the mep solution tends to a dirac function of the central state , while the map estimate tends to be @xmath1 for the central state and @xmath2 for the other states . on the other hand",
    "when there is a very large conformational freedom the mep solution tends to the uniform distribution in the space metric and the spread of the map estimate is minimal .    in the in - between cases",
    "the two approaches diverge .",
    "the mep solution is obtained as the solution with the minimal spread in the probability density . on the other hand the map estimate for each state is obtained via solutions with the largest possible spread between the probability of the estimated state and the probabilities of the states needed to complete the solution . since the problem is underdetermined , both approaches are consistent with the data .",
    "they focus on different aspects of the problem and they are in some sense complementary . for a deeper discussion of this topic , we refer the reader to @xcite .    in this paper we show a development of the map approach which permits the combination of different nmr constraints .",
    "the map approach has been inspired by @xcite , and the rigorous mathematical definition of the map has been given in @xcite , though different names have been subsequently used for this same bound of the probability .",
    "a geometrical algorithm has been developed in @xcite to calculate the map estimate when only residual dipolar coupling ( rdc ) @xcite are considered , using the linearity properties of these measurements .",
    "residual dipolar coupling and pseudo contact shift ( pcs ) @xcite , which are frequently obtained together , have been used to analyse the conformational freedom of calmodulin in @xcite , using a complicated and time - consuming numerical procedure .",
    "the main difficulty is that pcs ( as is the case for most sets of data ) do not possess the linearity properties of rdc , which permits working on averaged tensors .",
    "the maximum occurrence algorithm @xcite uses a predetermined pool of conformers to calculate the maximal probability .",
    "the choice of a finite number of conformers simplifies the algorithm and reduces the time needed for the calculations . with this choice",
    "the positions which would cause physical violations of the atoms of the two domains may be directly eliminated from the sample .",
    "the ses ( sparse ensemble selection ) method has been developed in @xcite , and is focused on recovering a small set of conformers with large probabilities .",
    "a recent paper compares the two approaches and shows the information content of rdc and pcs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the geometrical algorithm of @xcite to the case of pcs .",
    "indeed , since we drop the linearity requirement only fulfilled by paramagnetic rdc , the approach can be extended to any set of measurements .",
    "we use the calmodulin measurement scenario @xcite as our test case .",
    "calmodulin is a protein made by two rigid domains ( the n and c terminals ) connected by a flexible linker , see figure  [ fig : pdb ] in section  [ se : imple ] .",
    "a paramagnetic ion may be inserted in the binding sites of the n terminal , which is also called the metal domain .",
    "we can then measure nmr data for atoms belonging to both",
    "the n and c terminals .",
    "the rdc measurements @xcite are defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the vector connecting selected pairs @xmath5 and @xmath6 of chemically linked atoms and @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "the paramagnetic tensor @xmath8 is a symmetric and null - trace @xmath9 matrix , thus depending on @xmath10 coefficients .",
    "since the atoms are chemically bound , their distance may be considered fixed , so that @xmath11 is constant , and the only dependence is on the orientation of the vector @xmath12 . if the atoms belongs to the same domain as the metal , the tensor @xmath8 and the vector @xmath12 belong to the same rigid structure .",
    "the rdc of the metal domain can be used to fit the numerical values of the @xmath8 tensor using ( [ eq : rdc1 ] ) .",
    "the pcs measurements @xcite are given by @xmath13 a formula very similar to ( [ eq : rdc1 ] ) , with a different constant .",
    "in this case @xmath12 is however the vector connecting the metal and selected atoms @xmath14 .",
    "when the atom belongs to the metal domain there is no difference between rdc and pcs .",
    "in fact the atom does not move with respect to the metal ion , so @xmath12 is fixed .",
    "indeed rdc and pcs of atoms of the metal domain can be coupled to obtain a better fit for the paramagnetic tensor @xmath8 ( and possibly for the location of the paramagnetic metal ion ) , see for instance @xcite . from now on we suppose that this is the case , so that the paramagnetic tensor is known and only rdc and pcs for atoms belonging to the c terminal are considered . since the c terminal moves with respect to the metal ion , the nmr measurements are averages of different states of the molecule , so that we may speak about _ mean _ pcs or rdc .",
    "the rdc and pcs are in fact the average of the values obtained for different positions of the c terminal ( also called conformers ) .",
    "each conformer is identified by an euler transformation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a rotation and @xmath17 a translation .",
    "note however that the @xmath12 of formulas ( [ eq : rdc1 ] ) for rdc are difference of coordinates , so that the translations cancel , and we have @xmath18 note also that @xmath19 does not depend on @xmath20 in the case of rdc . because of the linker we can always suppose @xmath21 , so that the space of allowed euler transformations is compact",
    ".    let @xmath22 be the space of probability distributions on this compact space .",
    "each @xmath23 is identified by the probability density @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 since @xmath27 does not depend on @xmath17 for the rdc , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 . using the _",
    "mean paramagnetic tensor _",
    "@xmath30 equation ( [ eq : mrdc1 ] ) becomes : @xmath31    the same technique can not be used for pcs because of the term @xmath32 , so that @xmath33    different metal ions @xmath34 may be substituted in the same binding site belonging to the n terminal without influencing the fold of the protein @xcite .",
    "we suppose that each set of measurements relative to metal @xmath34 is obtained by averaging values relative to conformers , using the same probability distribution @xmath23 .",
    "note the following proposition , see for instance @xcite .",
    "[ prp : maxmet ] independent pcs and rdc measurements may be obtained from at most @xmath10 different metal ions @xmath34 .    this is due to the fact there are at most @xmath10 linearly independent paramagnetic tensors @xmath35 relative to metals @xmath36 .",
    "a sixth tensor @xmath37 may be written as a linear combination of the first five tensors .",
    "hence pcs and rdc ( and indeed mean pcs and rdc ) relative to this sixth metal can be written as the same linear combination of the measurements relative to the first five metals , see ( [ eq : mrdc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mpcs1 ] ) .    in general we can not determine @xmath38 from the measurements of the moving terminal .",
    "the problem is in fact underdetermined .",
    "the target distribution @xmath38 is a function of six variables , those defining the euler transformation .",
    "if we only consider rdc , @xmath38 is a function of the three variables identifying the rotation , be them unitary quaternions or euler angles .    on the other hand we only have a finite number of measurements .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the maximal number of independent rdc measurements from atoms of the c terminal is 25 , see for instance @xcite . also , the information content of pcs is weak @xcite .",
    "hence , no matter how many measurements are available , the distribution @xmath38 can not be recovered except in some trivial cases .",
    "we now report some well known properties of rdc and pcs , see for instance @xcite .",
    "we first examine the case of the rdc measurements .",
    "[ prp : maxrdc ] the maximal number of independent mean rdc measurements is @xmath39 .",
    "this result is the consequence of two different properties :    * the maximal number of independent mean paramagnetic tensors is @xmath10 ( see proposition  [ prp : maxmet ] ) . *",
    "the maximal number of independent mean rdc for each metal is @xmath10 .    for a proof , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) .",
    "more precisely , the independence of the rdc measurements is directly correlated to the independence of the mean paramagnetic tensors ( [ eq : measm1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath40 be the number of independent mean paramagnetic tensors .",
    "then the number of independent rdc measurements is @xmath41 .",
    "for the proof we refer to @xcite .",
    "proposition  [ prp : maxmet ] holds also for pcs , thus the maximum number of independent metal ions is again @xmath10 . however , in principle each mean pcs is independent from the other , see formula ( [ eq : measmcont ] ) .",
    "in practise if two atoms @xmath5 and @xmath6 are close , so are @xmath42 and @xmath43 . hence the values of the averaged pcs from ( [ eq : mpcs1 ] ) are also close . mathematically speaking",
    "we may observe that the values @xmath44 and @xmath45 are heavily correlated , so that the new information added by atom @xmath6 is very weak .",
    "suppose we have @xmath46 metal ions , and that @xmath35 are already given or determined via the rdc and pcs of the metal domain .",
    "take any @xmath23 , we can calculate the mean rdc and pcs with the general formula @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the probability density of @xmath38 at @xmath20 , and @xmath49 is defined by ( [ eq : eul1 ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath12 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 depend on the choice of atoms and the type of measurement .",
    "the term @xmath52 is constant for rdc . in the case of pcs , for physical reasons",
    "the distance between the metal ion and any other atom is anyway bounded away from @xmath2 .",
    "hence we may suppose that the measurements @xmath53 are uniformly bounded .",
    "we can obtain a certain number of rdc and pcs measurements for each of the @xmath40 metals , not necessarily referring to the same atoms .",
    "let @xmath54 be the total number of mean rdc , @xmath55 be the total number of mean pcs , and let @xmath56 .",
    "we can collect the measurements calculated from ( [ eq : measm1 ] ) in a vector , so that each @xmath23 defines a point @xmath57 .",
    "the key point of the geometrical approach is the projection from the space of finite distributions to the space of the measurements .",
    "let @xmath58 be such a projection , we may also decompose @xmath58 into the rdc and pcs components : @xmath59 let @xmath60 the set @xmath61 is compact because the measurements are uniformly bounded .",
    "the set @xmath61 is convex because if @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , then @xmath65 , @xmath66 $ ] , so that @xmath67    each convex set is the convex hull of its extreme points ( also called vertices ) , i.e. the points that can not be reconstructed using a convex combination of different points of the set .",

    "the set of vertices is a subset of @xmath70 , since @xmath61 is the set of convex combinations of these points .",
    "we do not need the property that each @xmath70 may be uniquely reconstructed , so we can nevertheless identify the set of vertices with @xmath70 .",

    "the standard deviation of the simulated pcs is @xmath196 for @xmath143 , @xmath197 for @xmath198 , @xmath199 for @xmath200 and finally @xmath201 for @xmath202 , the case where the c terminal is closer to the metal binding site .",
    "the map estimate detects this difference in the data . in the @xmath143 case using rdc we found @xmath203 for all the orientations of the c terminal .",
    "typical values for the other @xmath204 cases are @xmath205 , thus having a much larger span .",
    "the map estimate is then in principle able to detect an asymmetry in the data due to a restricted conformational freedom .",
    "we used the following steps to determine a central tendency of the measurement .",
    "* the orientation @xmath206 of the conformer with the largest @xmath126 is determined using rdc alone . *",
    "the translation @xmath207 of the conformer with the largest @xmath126 is determined using pcs alone .",
    "the rotation is kept fixed at @xmath208 .    in the following figures we present the results of the tests .    in figure",
    "[ fig : test1noerr ] we show the results of step 1 of the algorithm in cases @xmath177 ( circles ) , @xmath179 ( squares ) , @xmath178 ( triangles ) .",
    "the points represent the orientations of the sample with map larger than a certain threshold .",
    "the larger green dots , here and in the subsequent figures , mark the positions of the centers . in cases @xmath179 and @xmath178 there are two different zones with large map , due to the so - called phenomenon of _ ghost cones _",
    "@xcite , which derives from the symmetries of the rdc formula .    in figure",
    "[ fig : test2noerr ] we show the results of step 2 of the algorithm in cases @xmath177 and @xmath178 , case @xmath179 being very similar to case @xmath177 . note that the map of a large number of translations is close to @xmath1 , as a consequence of the poor resolving power of the pcs .",
    "a slightly better reconstruction is obtained for @xmath178 . in this case",
    "the center position is close to the metal , so that there are some pcs values which are rather large , see formula  ( [ eq : mpcs1 ] ) . to obtain these values",
    "the c terminal must remain close to the @xmath178 position for a not negligible fraction of time . as a consequence , the @xmath126 values for positions far from the metal is slightly reduced .    in figure",
    "[ fig : test3noerr ] we show the joint pcs+rdc case for determining an orientation . while the pcs do not resolve well the translation , they are useful to eliminate the ghost cones , thus determining the correct region of space for the orientations .",
    "the rdc and pcs formulas have the same type of symmetries , however the @xmath209 vectors from ( [ eq : eul1 ] ) are different , so that in general the symmetries do not coincide .",
    "we added an uncorrelated gaussian error to the mean measurements to take into account the experimental error .",
    "the error level was kept to @xmath210ppm @xmath211 for pcs and @xmath210hz @xmath211 for rdc .",
    "we applied the algorithm of subsection  [ ss : algorithm ] and report the results in the following figures .    in figure",
    "[ fig : test1err ] we show the results of step 1 of the algorithm .",
    "note that there are very few changes with respect to figure  [ fig : test1noerr ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the mean rdc have only @xmath212 degrees of freedom , while we have @xmath192 measurements .",
    "the svd algorithm implicitly fits the @xmath212 degrees of freedom of the mean rdc .",
    "since the error is assumed to be gaussian , a large number of measurements reduces the standard error of the fitted quantities .",
    "hence the information of the rdc is well recovered even when the experimental error is considered . as explained in the previous section",
    ", coupling pcs and rdc helps removing ghost cones .    in figure",
    "[ fig : test2err ] we show the results of step 2 of the algorithm , in case @xmath177 ( left panel ) and @xmath178 ( right panel ) . here",
    "the introduction of the experimental error worsen the results .",
    "this should not be a surprise , since most of the mean pcs are under the @xmath1hz threshold , so that their numerical value is destroyed by the error level which is larger . as already explained ,",
    "the case @xmath178 is better because the c terminal is close to the metal .",
    "figure  [ fig : res ] shows the final reconstruction . here",
    "the dark colored conformers show the positions with the largest probability , while the lightly colored conformers show the reconstructed positions @xmath213 .",
    "it should be noted that the algorithm does not include a step where pcs and rdc are analysed together , if not in order to remove the ghost cones .",
    "we did attempt this step , using a local maximization technique .",
    "the results of this step are on average only marginally better than the results of the algorithm .",
    "if great care is not applied in the optimization , the error on the translation may even increase . even in the joined rdc+pcs case ,",
    "the translation is determined only by the pcs values , since there is no dependence on the rdc .",
    "however , the dependence on the translation is very weak , as it can be seen from figure  [ fig : test2err ] , so that the variations in the map are largely due to the orientation of the conformer .",
    "more information on this additional attempt may be found in the supplementary material .",
    "in this paper we demonstrated the ability of pcs and rdc measurements to recover a central tendency of an unknown probability distribution representing the conformational freedom of a protein made by two rigid domains connected by a flexible linker .",
    "we made use of the map algorithm , extended to include pcs ( and indeed any other class of measurements ) .",
    "the map algorithm determines the largest probability of a conformer in a distribution satisfying the measurements .",
    "taken globally the map function is not a probability distribution but a sharp bound from above .",
    "for each position there is however an explicitly determined finite probability distribution with the map value as a weight for that conformer .",
    "the rdc measurements are well able to determine any central tendency in the orientation of the conformer . adding the pcs helps removing symmetric orientations , since the symmetries of the pcs are different from those of the rdc .",
    "the identification of the translation is more difficult .",
    "the rdc does not depend on the translation , so we can only use pcs .",
    "however the information content of the pcs is very weak , and is further destroyed by the experimental noise . with exact data we can only approximatively",
    "determine the central tendency of the translation , see figure  [ fig : test2noerr ] .",
    "the situation worsen when the experimental error is added , as shown by figure  [ fig : test2err ] .",
    "values of map larger than @xmath214 are obtained for a large fraction of the sample , and especially for positions relatively far from the metal . in other words ,",
    "the conformer can sample any positions far from the metal for the @xmath215 of the time , resulting in very small partial values of the pcs .",
    "adjusting the remaining @xmath216 of the distribution is enough to obtain the correct values of the pcs . as a consequence ,",
    "the determination of the translation is less accurate .",
    "we again stress that this is not due to the method employed .",
    "the map algorithm points out the extremal cases which should anyway be considered by any method trying to determine a solution . or course there might be reasons to exclude some probability distributions , for instance using some threshold on the number of conformers or on the spread of the distribution .",
    "these are additional hypotheses which reduce the set of compatible solutions . however , since the problem is underdetermined and the real solution is not known , the reasons for removing these particular solutions should be soundly justified .",
    "other methods might not able to detect the map solutions , for instance if a predetermined sample is used for the conformers .",
    "even if the sample is large , there might be a correlation between the rotational and translational part of the euler transformations of the sample . in this case",
    "the identification of the orientation might bias the translation towards the correct value .",
    "further developments will include the case when there is more than a single central tendency in the data . giving the results of this study",
    ", we foresee that additional information might be extracted only for the rotational part of the distribution . a possible way of overcoming this difficulty might be the inclusion of different measurements such as saxs ( small angle x - rays scattering ) @xcite .",
    "the nmr - saxs integration has already been studied using the mo ( maximum occurrence ) method in @xcite .",
    "since the saxs measurements depends on the global shape of the molecule this information might help in better determining the translational part of the euler transformation .",
    "* supplementary information : * in the supporting material some additional results are presented . while not strictly necessary for the purpose of the paper , these results increase the insight on the behaviour of the pcs and rdc class of measurements .",
