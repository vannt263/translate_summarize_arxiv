    "we have recently developed a three - part model for solar and stellar magnetic flux generation and transport ( ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* iik , schmitt & schssler 2007 , 2011 ) ) . in the first part , a one - dimensional mean - field @xmath0 dynamo with a saturation mechanism related to buoyant flux removal",
    "is set up at the position of the overshoot region at the base of the convection zone ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schmitt & schssler 1989 ) ) . for faster rotators ,",
    "the strength of the @xmath2-effect is assumed to scale with the rotation rate .",
    "this is identical to the assumption that the differential rotation rate scales with the activity level and thus with the rotation rate , as suggested recently by @xcite , based on observations of a homogeneous sample of cool stars . in the second part",
    ", time - latitude distribution of the dynamo - generated toroidal field determines the probability distribution that a flux tube would become unstable at a given latitude and time .",
    "the tubes are assumed to have properties given by the criteria for magnetic buoyancy instability at a given latitude .",
    "the emergence latitudes and tilt angles of bmrs are determined by numerical simulations of flux tube rise through the convection zone .",
    "these results are used as input for the flux transport model at the surface ( the third part ) , including effects of differential rotation , meridional flow , horizontal and radial diffusion .",
    "the number of emerging bmrs ( per activity cycle ) is scaled up with the rotation rate and their areas are determined randomly , following a probability distribution set by the sun - like area distribution , @xmath3 .",
    "the details of the model construction are described by @xcite .",
    "for the sun - like models , the cycle period decreases with the rotation rate , owing to stronger @xmath2-effect . for @xmath4",
    "d , the polar fields become stronger with increasing rotation rate , owing to increasing frequency of flux emergence and tilt angles , until another effect starts to set the stage : the increasing dynamo strength ( the @xmath2-effect ) , thus the increasing cycle frequency . for @xmath5",
    "d polar regions undergo field reversals with increasingly high frequency , so that the peak polar fields do not reach the field strengths expected from the emerging magnetic flux . for most of these cases",

    "[ fig:9d ] ) .",
    "the reason for the invisible stellar cycle is that during magnetic minima the magnetic flux at high latitudes become comparable to that of low latitudes during activity maxima .",
    "this intermediate rotator case represents a moderately active , but non - cyclic ( or weakly cyclic ) configuration ( in fact , there is a weak cycle with @xmath7-yr period ) .",
    "the model indicates a possibility that such stars may not be in a maunder minimum state and are still observed as non - cyclic .",
    "observational evidence on the existence of such stars already supports this possibility ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have applied the sun - like model to k - type stars with different radii .",
    "the first case is a k0-type main - sequence star , rotating 13 times faster than the sun .",
    "similar to the sun - like star with the same rotation rate , large tilt angles lead to formation of activity belts , but in this case as shifted towards the poles , because of an additional geometric effect . buoyant flux tubes experience a substantial coriolis acceleration in the rotating frame and rise almost parallel to the rotation axis in fast rotators",
    ". the larger the fractional depth of the convection zone , the higher the emergence latitudes , because the latitude difference between the initial and final latitudes of the rising flux tube is larger .",
    "the second model simulates a k1iv - type fast rotator , with the mass , radius , and the rotational period of the active subgiant component of the close binary system v711 tau ( = hr 1099 ) . the deep - seated dynamo pattern and the surface emergence are highly separated in latitude , owing to rapid rotation and convection zone geometry , as explained above .",

    "however , it should be noted that ( a ) the average brightness on the one hand is compared with the total magnetic flux on the other , and ( b ) the relative amplitudes of the short- and long - term cycles are not similar in both cases .",

    "[ fig : stft ] ( left panel ) is caused by the stochastic nature of flux emergence .",
