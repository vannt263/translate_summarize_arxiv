    "<S> using the concept of self similarity in the structure of the proton at small @xmath0 , we comment on possibility of a single positive fractal dimension of proton in analogy with classical monofractals . </S>",
    "<S> plausible dynamics and physical interpretation of fractal dimension are also discussed . </S>",

    "<S> _    self similarity is a familiar property in nature [ 1 , 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> many of the seemingly irregular shapes of nature have hidden self similarity in them . </S>",
    "<S> it is not the usual symmetry with respect to rotation or translation , but symmetry with respect to scale or size : a small part of a system is self similar to the entire system . </S>",
    "<S> such a system is defined through its self similar dimension , which is in general fraction , hence called fractal dimension . </S>",
    "<S> classical fractals discussed in standard references [ 1 , 2 ] are cantor dust , koch curve and sierpinski gasket whose fractional dimensions are 0.63 , 1.26 and 1.585 respectively , which lie between eucledian point and surfaces .    notion of self similarity and fractal dimensions are being used in the phase spaces of hadron multiparticle production processes since nineteen eighties [ 3 - 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however these ideas did not attract much attention in contemporary physics of deep inelastic lepton hadron scattering , due to its obvious lack of applicability . </S>",
    "<S> only recently [ 8 ] , lastovicka has developed relevant formalism and applied it to deep inelastic electron - proton scattering at small @xmath0 and proposed a functional form of the structure function @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically a description of @xmath1 reflecting self similarity is proposed with a few parameters which are fitted to recent hera data [ 9 , 10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the specific parameterization is claimed to provide an excellent description of the data which covers a region of four momentum transferred squared @xmath2 and of bjorken @xmath0 , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , it was observed [ 11 - 13 ] that the positivity of fractal dimensions prohibits some of the fitted parameters of the structure function of reference [ 8 ] . specifically out of the fractal dimensions @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , one is negative ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the positivity of fractal dimension forbids such negative value . in order to avoid such possibility </S>",
    "<S> , it is suggested that the proton is described by the single self similarity dimension @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this then facilitates one to compare the self similarity nature of the proton at small @xmath0 with the classical monofractals which is the aim of the present note .    under the hypothesis of self similarity of the proton structure at small </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 , lastovicka [ 8 ] obtained the following form of the structure function @xmath1 ,    @xmath9    by using the following form of un - integrated quark density @xmath10 of @xmath11-th quark flavor : @xmath12 in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath4 is the dimensional correlation relating the two magnification factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the self similarity dimensions associated with them , @xmath15 being the normalisation constant . since the magnification factors should be positive , non - zero and dimensionless , a choice @xmath16 , rather than </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 has been made , while @xmath18 is arbitrary small virtuality , @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> explicit confrontation with hera data [ 9 , 10 ] yields , @xmath20 as the self similarity dimensions of fractals are positive [ 1 , 2 ] , by its definitions one expects @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , a feature absent in the empirical fit of [ 8 ] as far as @xmath6 is concerned . in analogy with other classic fractals [ 1 , 2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we therefore assume that proton at small @xmath0 is a monofractal with just one single fractal dimension , so that    @xmath24    under such a hypothesis , equation ( 1 ) is rewritten as ,    @xmath25    alternately , monofractality is attainable also for @xmath26 ( zero dimensional correlation ) and @xmath27 , so that equation ( 1 ) takes the alternate form , @xmath28    in figure ( 1 ) , we plot @xmath1 versus @xmath0 in bins of @xmath17 as measured by low @xmath17 data of zeus [ 10 ] using equation(5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> results of the fit yields , @xmath29 however this fit(equation 7 ) can not be extrapolated to higher @xmath17 range of h1 [ 9 ] . even for @xmath30 of zeus [ 10 ] </S>",
    "<S> data , @xmath31 becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> +    table 1    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure ( 2 ) , we show the similar analysis using equation ( 6 ) for zeus data [ 10 ] . results of the fit yields , @xmath32 this fit ( equation 8) can be extrapolated to higher @xmath17 range of h1 [ 10 ] upto @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31 for equation ( 7 ) and ( 8) are recorded in table 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis thus indicates that only in the limited @xmath34 range ( @xmath35 ) , the notion of monofractality of proton holds . in that range , </S>",
    "<S> dimensional correlation ( @xmath4 ) vanishes and the proton possesses fractality ( @xmath36 ) close to koch curve ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> description of @xmath1 in the entire small @xmath0 range in terms of monofractal will result in a continuous @xmath0 , @xmath17 dependent fractal dimension [ 13 ] which is a considerable extension of parameter space and contrary to the usual notion of fractal . from dynamical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , breakdown of monofractality conjecture presumbly implies existence of long range interaction among the small @xmath0 gluons . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that [ 14 ] if there are no long range interactions , one expects that all fractal dimensions are equal to one another ; i.e. the system is a single fractal as demonstrated explicitly by the ising model [ 15 ] and feynman wilson fluid [ 16 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also instructive at this stage to ascertain the physical interpretation of fractal dimension of proton , since the notion is rather recent in literature . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known [ 17 ] , the fractal dimension measures the way , in which distribution of points fill a geometric space on the average . </S>",
    "<S> if the distribution is highly inhomogeneous , the set of points have a distribution of fractal dimensions leading to multifractality . extending the notion to the @xmath34 plane of the unintegrated quark density </S>",
    "<S> , fractal dimension tells how densely small @xmath0 partons fill the proton in self similar way on the average . in the special case of @xmath38,@xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> unintegrated quark density takes the simple form , @xmath39 and fractal dimension is essentially close to @xmath0-slope [ 18 ] or pomeron intercept [ 19 - 21 ] .    to conclude , </S>",
    "<S> let us also comment on the negative fractal dimension @xmath6 of reference [ 8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> as noted earlier , fractal dimensions being positive , lastovicka s work [ 8 ] as such can not be regarded strictly as pure fractal analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it is a good description of data in terms of five parameters without implication on fractals . </S>",
    "<S> one plausible way of preserving positivity of fractal dimensions but still giving a good description of hera data is through suitable modification of the magnification factors as occurred in the original formalism . </S>",
    "<S> such a work is currently in progress . </S>"
