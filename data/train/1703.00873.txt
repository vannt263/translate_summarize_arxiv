    "the relevant quantities to extract strange quark mass @xmath3 from semi - leptonic @xmath0-decay are the polarization functions , the data on which were made available some years ago by aleph @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations .",
    "one of the important theoretical objective in these extractions is to account for the renormalization group ( rg ) running of all the parameters that enter the evolutions .",
    "there have been several schemes , for example _ fixed - order perturbation theory _ ( fopt ) @xcite , _ contour - improved perturbation theory _ ( cipt ) @xcite and _ method of effective charges _ ( mec ) @xcite to account for these runnings .",

    "the rg - accessible logarithms are defined as all the leading and the next - to - leading logarithms that can be accessed through rg equation .",

    "the experimentally measurable quantities relevant for the extraction of @xmath3 from cabibbo suppressed semi - leptonic @xmath0-decay are the moments of polarization functions . these can be written as a contour integral of the polarization functions with suitable weight functions in the complex @xmath5 plane running counter clockwise along the circle @xmath6 @xmath7 \\frac{dq^2}{m_\\tau^2 } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 are the weight functions , @xmath9 is the @xmath0-decay polarization function and @xmath10 is the adler function related to the polarization function @xmath11 and defined as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . the functions @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite are known to order @xmath14 in the perturbation theory , and they have in addition to @xmath15 dependence , @xmath4 dependence through terms like @xmath16 , at each order @xmath17 in the perturbation expansion . both @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfy homogeneous rg equations . in the next section we show how the rg equations of these functions can be used to obtain closed form sums of all the rg accessible logarithms which reduce @xmath4 dependence .",
    "we demonstrate the derivations of rgspt series with @xmath10 . we write down",
    "the un - summed and rgspt series as @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] , respectively . here",
    "the intermediate quantities are defined as @xmath20 = \\sum_{n = k}^\\infty d^{mg}_{n , n - k}(a_s l)^{n - k}$ ] , @xmath21 are the series coefficients that can be extracted from the expression of @xmath10 given in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "we substitute the un - summed expression of @xmath10 in the homogeneous rg equation that it satisfies and collect the coefficients of @xmath24 which leads to a recursion relation in terms of the series coefficients @xmath21 .",
    "the recursion relation is then multiplied by @xmath25 and is summed from @xmath26 to infinity , which following the definitions of the intermediate quantities @xmath20 $ ] results in differential equations for them .",
    "these differential equations are solved with suitable boundary conditions and the resultant solutions are the closed form expressions of @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "the closed form expressions of @xmath28 $ ] are given in @xcite .",
    "the extraction of @xmath3 is possible by the measurements of the @xmath29 flavor breaking terms @xmath30 where the second term within the bracket is the contribution of the condensate @xcite .",
    "the vales of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are collected in @xcite .",
    "the flavor breaking term @xmath33 for different moments @xmath34 have been measured by aleph @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations . for our determination",
    ", we have used the moments @xmath35 of aleph and @xmath36 and @xmath37 of opal .",
    "the determinations for individual moments for both aleph and opal are tabulated in @xcite and are compared with the determinations in fopt , cipt and mec schemes .",
    "we find that rgspt is consistent with other schemes . by doing a weighted average of the individual determinations we obtain the following final values of @xmath3 at the @xmath0 mass scale @xmath38 for aleph and opal data , respectively . here",
    "the errors are dominated by experimental uncertainties .",
    "evolving these determinations to 2 gev using @xcite we get @xmath39 for aleph and opal data , respectively . within errors",
    "our determinations are comparable with that in lattice qcd .",
    "we have applied for the first time the optimal renormalization group analysis to @xmath0-decay polarization functions in the context of extraction of strange quark mass .",
    "our determinations are consistent with other schemes and show that the strange quark mass extracted from @xmath0-decay is insensitive to the choice of renormalization schemes .",
    "therefore , in the future when the experimental data improve , precise determinations of @xmath3 can be made .",
