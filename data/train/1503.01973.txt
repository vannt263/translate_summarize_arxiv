    "the equation for the photon orbit is of 4th order in @xmath16 and can thus be solved analytically . for the extreme kerr - newman solution ,",
    "a very simple expression for the photon orbit follows , which can be found in the work by balek _",
    "we also discuss the solutions for the marginally bound and marginally stable orbits .",
    "it turns out that in the prograde case , all these radii coincide with the horizon s value @xmath17 for all angular momenta of the black hole greater than a special value .",
    "such an agreement in coordinate values is well known from the extreme kerr metric .",
    "we note that it does not mean that the locations of these orbits and the horizon are the same on slices of constant boyer - lindquist time , but they are the same on horizon - crossing slices as was shown by jacobson @xcite .",
    "we start with the kerr - newman metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath18 : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 and where we have set the gravitational constant and the speed of light equal to one . from here",
    "on in we study the equatorial plane @xmath22 .",
    "we use the coordinates per mass as a characteristic length ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and rescale the parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",

    "@xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 we note that the event horizon of the black hole is characterized by @xmath35",
    "since the metric does not depend on @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we can find two constants @xmath38 and @xmath39 , associated with the specific energy and the specific angular momentum of a particle ( also discussed in detail in @xcite ) : @xmath40 where the dot denotes a differentiation with respect to proper time . for circular orbits , these constants can be determined by analyzing the zeros of an effective potential @xmath41 and its derivative @xmath42 . during the calculation",
    "it is helpful to introduce the new coordinate @xmath43 instead of @xmath44 , to handle polynomials of @xmath45 instead of combinations of @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",

    "the photon orbit is the only light - like circular geodesic around the black hole , hence the name . in addition",
    "it is a limiting case for the innermost time - like geodesic .",
    "a particle with non - zero rest mass would need an infinite amount of energy to be on this orbit . in this case",
