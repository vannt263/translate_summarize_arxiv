    "<S> we study analytically and numerically the properties of one - dimensional chain of cold ions placed in a periodic potential of optical lattice and global harmonic potential of a trap . in close similarity with the frenkel - kontorova model , a transition from sliding to </S>",
    "<S> pinned phase takes place with the increase of the optical lattice potential for the density of ions incommensurate with the lattice period . </S>",
    "<S> quantum fluctuations lead to a quantum phase transition and melting of pinned instanton glass phase at large values of dimensional planck constant . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are also relevant for a wigner crystal placed in a periodic potential .    nowadays </S>",
    "<S> experimental techniques allow to store thousands of cold ions and observe various ordered structures formed by coulomb repulsion in ion traps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these structures include the one - dimensional ( 1d ) wigner crystal , zig - zag and helical structures in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the cirac - zoller proposal of quantum computations with cold trapped ions @xcite generated an enormous experimental progress in this field with implementations of quantum algorithms and quantum state preparation with up to 8 qubits @xcite . in these experiments </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ions form a 1d chain placed in a global harmonic potential which frequency @xmath0 determines the eigenfrequencies of chain oscillations being independent of ion charge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> highly accurate experimental control of the chain modes allows to perform quantum gates between internal levels of ions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to ion traps , modern laser techniques allow to create periodic optical lattices and store in them thousands of cold atoms ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a single ion dynamics in an optical lattice has been also studied experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these two techniques makes possible to study experimentally the properties of a 1d chain of few tens of ions placed in an optical lattice and a global harmonic potential at ultra low temperatures .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the physical properties of such a system and show that it is closely related to the frenkel - kontorova model ( fkm ) @xcite which gives a mathematical description of various physical phenomena including crystal dislocations , commensurate - incommensurate phase transitions , epitaxial monolayers on a crystal surface , magnetic chains and fluxon dynamics in josephson junctions ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) . as in the classical fkm </S>",
    "<S> the ion chain exhibits the aubry analyticity breaking transition @xcite when the amplitude of optical potential becomes larger than a certain critical value . below the critical point </S>",
    "<S> the classical chain can slide ( oscillate ) in the incommensurate optical lattice while above the transition it becomes pinned by the lattice and a large gap opens in the spectrum of phonon excitations . above the transition the positions of ions form a devil s staircase corresponding to a fractal cantor set which replaces a continuous kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) curve in the phase space below the transition . according to @xcite the fkm ground state is unique but in the pinned phase there are exponentially many stable configurations which are exponentially close to the ground state and the system resembles a fractal spin glass @xcite . in the quantum fkm </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the instanton tunneling between quasidegenerate configurations leads to a melting of the pinned instanton glass and the quantum phase transition into sliding phonon phase takes place above a critical value of the effective planck constant @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the fkm with nearest neighbor interactions between particles , the ions have long range coulomb interactions . in spite of </S>",
    "<S> that we show that the ion system is effectively described by the fkm and has similar phase transitions which can be studied experimentally . to analyze the properties of the fk ion model ( fkim ) with few hundreds of ions we use various numerical methods including classical and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithms as described in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless fkim hamiltonian has the form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are ion momentum and position , @xmath4 gives the strength of optical lattice potential and all @xmath5 ions are placed in a harmonic potential with frequency @xmath0 . to make a transfer from ( [ eq1 ] ) to dimensional physical units </S>",
    "<S> one should note that the lattice constant @xmath6 in @xmath7 is taken to be unity , the energy @xmath8 is measured in units of ion charge energy @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is ion mass . in the quantum case @xmath12 with dimensionless @xmath1 measured in units @xmath13 . in the quantum case we use the approximation of distinguishable ions which is well justified when the distance between ions imposed by the harmonic potential is comparable with the lattice period @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.2 in -0.0 cm    we start the discussion from the classical case . here </S>",
    "<S> the stable configurations with minimal energy have @xmath14 and satisfy the conditions @xmath15 . in approximation of only nearest neighbor </S>",
    "<S> interacting ions these conditions lead to the dynamical recursive map for equilibrium ion positions @xmath16 : @xmath17 where the effective momentum conjugated to @xmath16 is @xmath18 and the kick function @xmath19 . to check the validity of this description we find the ground state configuration using numerical methods described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic frequency @xmath0 is chosen in such a way that in the middle of the chain the ion density @xmath20 at @xmath21 is equal to the golden mean value @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an incommensurate phase with the golden kam curve usually studied for the aubry transition @xcite . for a fixed @xmath23 the strength of harmonic potential </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 drops with @xmath5 according to relations found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical values @xmath16 allow to determine the function @xmath25 using relations ( [ eq2 ] ) and show that with good accuracy @xmath26 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this result to an effective screening of global harmonic potential by long range interactions between ions in the central part of the chain where the ion density is approximately constant . for small values of optical potential ( @xmath27 ) </S>",
    "<S> the chain is in the sliding phase with a continuous kam curve in the plane @xmath28 while above the aubry transition at @xmath29 it is in the pinned phase and forms a fractal cantor set in the phase space ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative change of chain properties is also seen via the hull function @xmath30 which gives the ion positions in periodic potential vs. unperturbed positions at @xmath21 both taken @xmath31 : for @xmath32 one has a continuous function @xmath33 while for @xmath34 the hull function has a form of devil s staircase with clustering of ion positions at certain values ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> more data for a larger number of ions @xmath35 are shown in appendix ( see fig.[fig6 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.2 in -0.0 cm    = 3.2 in -0.0 cm    the structural changes in the chain below and above the aubry transition at the critical value @xmath36 are also clearly seen in the spectrum of phonon excitations shown in fig.[fig2 ] ( see also fig.[fig7 ] in appendix for @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath32 the spectrum of phonon modes has a sound like form at small wave vectors @xmath37 , going down to a minimal oscillation frequency @xmath38 , which is small compared to frequencies of periodic potential . for @xmath34 the spectrum of excitations is characterized by a phonon gap when @xmath39 becomes independent of number of ions @xmath5 ( fig.[fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to the data of fig.[fig3 ] for @xmath40 and of fig.[fig8 ] in appendix for the hull function the critical point is located at @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath36 can be obtained approximately by a reduction of map ( [ eq2 ] ) to the chirikov standard map @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for that the second equation ( [ eq2 ] ) can be linearized near @xmath42 that gives the chirikov standard map with chaos parameter @xmath43 and the critical value @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath45 . this value is smaller than the value @xmath41 obtained from numerical data that can be attributed to a strong dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.2 in -0.0 cm    the obtained results show that the ion chain in a periodic potential has close similarities with the fkm . </S>",
    "<S> the map ( [ eq2 ] ) describes quite accurately the central 1/3 part of the chain where the ion density is approximately constant . </S>",
    "<S> outside of this part the ion density starts to grow and deviations from the map start to be visible in @xmath28 plain and @xmath30 , even if the @xmath48-function remains rather close to @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> a separation on two parts is also seen in the lowest phonon eigenmodes which are localized in the central part of the chain ( see figs.[fig9],[fig10 ] of appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , in similarity with the fkm @xcite , we find that in the pinned phase at @xmath34 the fkim has properties of a spin glass with enormous number of stable equilibrium configurations @xmath50 in the very close vicinity of the ground state ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.2 in -0.0 cm    these quasidegenerate configurations become very important in the quantum chain where quantum tunneling between them leads to nontrivial instanton excitations . to study the quantum case we use the qmc approach @xcite with the euclidean time @xmath51 in the interval @xmath52 $ ] and system temperature @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> we use large values of @xmath54 ( e.g. @xmath55 ) so that the temperature @xmath56 is small compared to periodic potential @xmath4 and phonon gap @xmath57 . to see the structural changes produced by quantum fluctuations it is convenient to compute the formfactor of ion positions defined as @xmath58 , where summation is taken over the central part of the chain with @xmath59 ions , @xmath60 are ions positions at euclidian time @xmath51 and brackets mark averaging over @xmath51 . in the classical case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 are the equilibrium positions of ions . for @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> the formfactor peaks are equidistant in @xmath47 that clearly show the incommensurate sliding phase at @xmath62 ( fig.[fig5]a ) . for @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> the peaks in @xmath64 are at integer @xmath37 values showing that ions are pinned by the optical lattice ( fig.[fig5]b bottom ) . in the quantum case at @xmath63 and small values of @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> the density of instantons is small and quantum tunneling does not destroy the pinned phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , at large @xmath66 quantum fluctuations lead to melting of pinned phase , the integer peaks disappear and @xmath64 becomes continuous ( fig.[fig5]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the ion chain can slide in the optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase transition from pinned instanton glass to sliding phonon gas takes place at zero temperature and certain @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> the formfactor @xmath64 can be experimentally obtained by light scattering on the ion chain and in this way various phases of the system can be detected . for experimental conditions like in @xcite the distance between @xmath68 ions is about @xmath69 so that the golden mean density @xmath47 corresponds to the lattice constant @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this value can be realized by laser beams crossed at a fixed angle . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to pinned phase takes place at the optical lattice potential @xmath71 that in principle can be reached in strong laser fields . for @xmath72 ions with such @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless planck constant is @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that such experiments with cold trapped ions can be performed in a deep semiclassical regime hardly accessible to the qmc numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that a strong gap in phonon spectrum @xmath74 for @xmath34 ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] ) may be useful for protection of quantum gate operations in quantum computations .    </S>",
    "<S> higher values of dimensionless @xmath1 can be reached with electrons forming a wigner crystal placed in a periodic potential where @xmath75 for @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation may appear in 1d electron wires , molecular structures or nanotubes where a devil s staircase behavior has been discussed recently @xcite . in the regime when the number of electrons per period is of the order of @xmath23 the effects related to statistics of particles are not so crucial and the quantum melting of the pinned phase should qualitatively follow the scenario described here . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the obtained results describe also a more general problem of a wigner crystal in a periodic potential .    </S>",
