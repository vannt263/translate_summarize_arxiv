    "the taiwanese american occultation survey ( taos ) continuously monitors up to @xmath01,000 stars with four telescopes at @xmath1  hz , for the purpose of detecting occultations of these stars by small ( @xmath21  km ) objects in the kuiper belt and beyond .",
    "installation of the first three telescopes and the first version of the control software were completed in january 2005 , and the survey was officially started shortly thereafter .",
    "installation of the fourth telescope was completed in january 2007 , and four telescope operations commenced in august 2008 .",
    "the taos collaboration has finished analysis of the first two years of three - telescope data , which comprises over 150,000  star - hours of observations .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in @xcite .",
    "the principal science questions addressed with this survey are :    * what are the number and size distribution of small ( @xmath00.510  km in diameter ) bodies in the trans - neptunian region ?",
    "* is there an extension of the kuiper belt beyond @xmath3  au comprising bodies too small to have been detected in direct surveys ? * what are the number and size distribution of objects ( e.g. sedna ) in the _ extended disk _ of the solar system ?",
    "the signatures we are searching for are brief reductions in flux from background stars due to occultations by small kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) and extended disk objects ( edos ) .",
    "the occultation survey technique is uniquely suited to the detection of such objects , since it is capable of detecting objects that are much fainter than the magnitude limit of any plausible direct survey @xcite .",
    "however , the occultation technique is difficult to implement in practice , so the project includes some important technology development goals . for more details on the occultation technique",
    "applied to searches for outer solar system objects see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for an overview of the taos project , see @xcite , @xcite , and .",
    "for more information on the kuiper belt , see @xcite , , @xcite , and @xcite . for more information on the extended disk ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in addition to the primary science goals stated above , a rapid response capability was implemented on the taos system to observe optical counterparts to gamma ray burst ( grb ) events reported to the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) .",
    "the taos system observed its first optical counterpart to a grb in october of 2007 @xcite . the follow - up capability will be described in .",
    "implementation of an occultation survey for detection of small kbos presents a number of challenges .",
    "first , such events have very short durations , typically about 200  ms @xcite .",
    "second , such events are extremely rare .",
    "estimates of occultation event rates are model dependent and range from as low as @xmath4  events per star per year @xcite to as high as @xmath5  events per star per year @xcite .",
    "( note that when this survey was designed in 1996 , occultation event rates as high as @xmath6  per star per year were predicted for objects down to 1  km in diameter , but the results of @xcite showed a likely break in the size spectrum at diameters of about 30  km , which lowered the expected event rate . )",
    "the taos system was thus designed to meet the following criteria :    * make photometric measurements at a high sampling rate ( 5  hz ) .",
    "* continuously monitor enough stars ( @xmath01,000 ) to obtain a significant event rate . *",
    "low ( @xmath70.1   per year ) false positive rate .",
    "the rapid photometry is achieved by means of the innovative use of an otherwise conventional ccd camera ( which will be described in ) .",
    "an adequate number of stars can be imaged by a modern ccd camera mounted on a small ( 50 cm ) , fast ( f/1.9 ) telescope with a wide field of view ( 3@xmath8 ) .    achieving the goal of a low false positive rate was a primary driver of the design .",
    "our goal was to be able to measure a rate of stellar occultations by kbos of 1  event per 1,000  stars per year of observing time .",
    "we make @xmath0@xmath9 photometric measurements per year , from which we want to derive less than one spurious occultation .",
    "the false alarm probability per observation must therefore be exceedingly small if the results of the survey are to be interpreted with confidence .",
    "we control false alarms by requiring joint detections in an array of four independent robotic telescopes .",
    "false positives of terrestrial or atmospheric origin ( such as birds , aircraft , extreme atmospheric scintillation events , etc . )",
    "are removed by this requirement .",
    "false positives due to main belt asteroids can be eliminated by automated follow - up of detected events at a nearby , larger telescope . however",
    ", this would require a real - time analysis pipeline , which has not yet been implemented for this project .",
    "the telescopes are spaced far enough apart that scintillation events are unlikely to affect all of the telecopes simultaneously .",
    "note , however , that the telescopes are close enough that any occultation events would be detected by all four telescopes ( see @xcite for a detailed description of occultation events from objects in the outer solar system ) .",
    "finally , note that the redundancy in the multi - telescope system also greatly enhances the credibility of the reported results .",
    "it would be difficult to credibly report on rare occultation events that were seen in only a single telescope .",
    "this paper will specifically address the first two design criteria listed above .",
    "a detailed description of the survey system ( both hardware and software ) will be presented , and the implementation of the survey system to address the design criteria will be discussed .",
    "we have developed statistical analysis techniques which make efficient use of the multi - telescope data to limit the false positive rate and provide a credible result , however , discussion of these techniques is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "an introduction to the statistical analysis methods used by the taos project can be found in @xcite , and a discussion of the application of these techniques will appear in a future paper @xcite .",
    "the telescopes are installed atop lu - lin mountain ( longitude @xmath10  e ; latitude @xmath11  n , elevation 2850  meters ) , in the yu shan ( jade mountain ) area of taiwan .",
    "the median seeing is @xmath12 , with @xmath0100  clear nights per year .",
    "most of the poor nights occur during rainy season ( may through september ) . since the beginning of 2005",
    ", taos has averaged @xmath0400 hours per year of actual observing , an average of four hours per clear night .",
    "high humidity is typically the reason the observing hours are limited on clear nights .",
    "( plans are currently being developed to start a new survey at a drier site . )",
    "the telescopes have separations ranging from 6  meters to 60  meters ( see ) . these separations are sufficient to eliminate most , if not all , false positives arising from extreme scintillation events .",
    "note that the original design for the taos project had the fourth telescope sited at a different peak located 7  km to the west of the lu - lin site @xcite .",
    "the reason for this was that differences in the timing of an event would give a measurement of the relative velocity of the occulting object , thus allowing the object distance to be estimated .",
    "this plan was abandoned for several reasons .",
    "first , the development of the second site was logistically very difficult , and hence extremely expensive .",
    "second , an occultation shadow crossing the lu - lin site would cross the second site only during part of the year , due to the obliquity of the earth .",
    "third , our 5  hz sampling rate is not nearly fast enough to give a velocity measurement sufficiently accurate to provide a reasonable estimate of the distance .",
    "finally , it was determined that a four - telescope system would provide significantly better statistical identification of false positives than a three - telescope system , as well as enable detection of smaller objects .",
    "this will be described in @xcite .",
    "the four identical telescopes were manufactured by torus technologies ( now optical mechanics , inc . ) .",
    "the taos telescopes were designed to be compact , and the optical design was based on the system requirement to cover a large number of stars using a camera with a single ccd chip . considering the affordable cost and ease of manufacturing , a 50  cm aperture was chosen . each telescope is a cassegrain system with the focal plane located behind the primary mirror . in order to provide the fast converging beam for a wide field of view ,",
    "a parabolic primary mirror with f/1.5 is used .",
    "combined with a large f/3.6 spherical secondary mirror ( 25  cm diameter ) , the overall f  ratio is about 1.9  with an effective field of view of 3@xmath8 . with a 14  @xmath13 m pixel ccd ,",
    "the plate scale is about 3  arc  sec / pixel , which undersamples the seeing of the site .",
    "the effective collecting area is about 1875  @xmath14.the wide field correctors consist of five lenses to provide a flat focal plane .",
    "four different materials were used for the chromatic correction .",
    "the design criterion was to provide 60% of the enclosed energy within one pixel area within the passband between 500  to 750  nm .",
    "the design and modeling of the telescope was done using the zemaxsoftware package .",

    "second , the friction wheel assemblies were redesigned and refabricated by engineers at the institute for astronomy and astrophysics at academia sinica in taiwan , and the reduction gears were replaced with bayside model px-34 - 050-lb ( 50:1 ) devices .",
    "third , the secondary focus drive systems were completely redesigned by engineers at academia sinica .",
    "a renishaw rgh22 linear encoder with 0.5  @xmath13 m resolution was added to each telescope to enable the secondary focus positions to be accurately set to within 1.25  @xmath13 m ( the limiting resolution from the stepper motor and threading of the drive shaft ) .",
    "the encoders are equipped with limit switches to keep the secondary mirror from bottoming out against the support structure in one direction and completely unscrewing from the support structure in the other direction .",
    "the encoder system is also equipped with a magnetic reference mark to reproduce the home position within one motor step , which is needed for the automatic focus control ( see ) .",
    "finally , the primary mirror of the fourth telescope was repolished and resurfaced by the space optics group at the korea research institute of standards and science in daejeon , south korea , and it is now of quality comparable to the three other primaries .    due to the poor optical quality of the optical components , the actual enclosed energy within one pixel averages about 30% rather than the design goal of 60% .",
    "the best psfs now range from 1.6  pixels ( 4.6  arc sec ) in the center of the image to 2.5  pixels ( 7.3  arc sec ) in the corners .",
    "this lowered the limiting magnitude of the survey .",
    "we have partially compensated for the reduced optical quality by an upgrade to the ccd camera from a low quantum efficiency , front illuminated device to a camera with a back illuminated ccd ( as will be described in the following section ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the survey is now roughly @xmath17 , rather than our target of @xmath18 .",
    "we have made a careful search for the densest fields along the ecplitic ( see ) , and we are typically able to monitor fields with 300  500 stars , which is within a factor of 2  3 of our design goal . we have designed a hartmann - shack device to routinely check on the optical performance of telescopes .",
    "each telescope is equipped with a thermoelectrically cooled spectral instruments series 800 ccd camera employing a thinned , backside - illuminated e2v @xmath19 ccd42 - 40 chip.2048 , but there are four extra rows at the end of the ccd to act as a buffer for current leakage from the substrate .",
    "these rows must be read out in zipper mode as they are shifted with every other row . however , the current leakage is negligible at our 5  hz image cadence , so we can use these extra rows as actual imaging area . ]",
    "the ccds have 13.5  @xmath13 m pixels , corresponding to a plate scale of 2.9  arc  sec per pixel , and the total image area is 27.6  mm  @xmath20  27.6  mm .",
    "there are two read channels , which work at a combined speed of @xmath21  pixels per second .",

    "the cameras are operated at a temperature of -20@xmath23  c , and the dark current is about 0.05  e@xmath22/sec / pixel . each ccd chip has the e2v mid - band coating , providing peak quantum efficiency of more than 93% and mean quantum efficiency over the spectral range we will employ of over 90% .",
    "each camera has a custom - made filter ( produced by custom scientific , inc . ) which provides more than 80% transmission between the quantum efficiency of the ccd and filter transmission curves are shown in .",
    "the camera was delivered with a chiller for the thermoelectric cooler , but we found this difficult to operate remotely . since we do not need chilled water for our application the chillers were replaced with itw cooling systems 2500ss welding coolers , which are simply water circulators with fan - cooled radiators . each cooler is equipped with a gems  2659 flow switch relay , which will signal if the coolant flow stops for some reason .",
    "accurate weather monitoring is an important component in any robotic telescope system , especially at a site prone to rain and high humidity .",

    "the two systems are used for redundancy in case one of them fails .",
    "these weather stations provide information such as temperature , humidity , dew point , barometric pressure , and wind speed and direction .    to provide accurate measurement of the dew point under high humidity conditions ,",
    "we have installed a pair of vaisala hmt337 humidity and temperature sensors .",

    "if one of these parameters crosses a threshold , a `` weath_bad '' alarm state is entered .",
    "if this alarm state is entered , the lids of all of the enclosures will immediately be closed automatically . in addition",
    ", we have defined a second set of thresholds which need to be crossed for the weath_bad alarm state to be turned off .",
    "if a weath_bad alarm state is entered , the weather parameters must be past the threshold values for 3  minutes before the alarm is turned off .",
    "this prevents the alarm from rapidly turning on and off when one of the parameters is hovering near the threshold .",
    "these thresholds are shown in .",
    "the taos enclosures ( see ) were designed to withstand the hurricane force winds which accompany the four or five typhoons which typically move through the region every summer .",
    "the enclosure walls consist of two 1  mm thick steel plates separated by 5  cm of insulating foam and are supported by steel beams .",
    "the working area is about .",
    "the lids are of a counterweighted clamshell type design .",
    "they are constructed of polyurethane - filled fiberglass and were fabricated by the aeronautical research laboratory of the chungshan institute of science and technology in taiwan .",
    "each lid is actuated by an adlee bm-370 brushless dc motor and a 1:400 worm reducer made by shin wei ent co. a custom control circuit is used to provide both manual operation and automated robotic operation through software .",
    "the time to open or close the lid is about one minute . in order to keep the lid operational during a power failure ,",
    "the motor is powered by a smr mcs1800 dc ups made by delta electronics inc .",
    "each enclosure is equipped with air - conditioning to keep the temperature of the telescope close to the anticipated night time temperature .",
    "this improves image quality by minimizing the temperature difference between the telescope components and the ambient temperature , and also minimizes the time used to find the best focus and focus change during the night .",
    "finally , each enclosure is equipped with a custom isolation transformer to protect the hardware from power surges induced by lightning .",
    "all four taos enclosures are connected to the control building by 1  gbps fiber optic cable for lightning protection as well .      in each enclosure , every subsystem other than the telescope and camera is controlled by a sealevel systems model 8010 32  bit i / o card which is connected to a custom built interface box .",
    "these boxes are based on a design used by the rotse survey  @xcite , but the design has been extensively modified .",
    "the boxes control the power to the cameras , the camera coolers , and the telescopes .",
    "the boxes also monitor the limit switches on the telescopes , and will automatically cut the power to a telescope if one of the switches is tripped .",
    "this is done in hardware with a series of relay switches to ensure reliability .",
    "the chiller flow switches are also monitored by these systems , and the software will turn off the thermoelectric cooler on the ccd and cut the power to the chiller should the flow unexpectedly stop .",
    "the lids are also controlled by these interface boxes .",
    "the lids are opened and closed by asserting 12  v signal lines to the lid controller boxes .",
    "the limit switches to the lids are also monitored , and once again a set of relay switches will automatically cut the power to the open / close line when the open / close limit switch is tripped .    finally , each box is equipped with an ics advent wdt5 watchdog module .",
    "this module must be pinged by the i / o card once every second , or it will close a set of relay switches which will automatically cut the power to the telescope and close the lid . if the computer crashes or one of the control daemons should happen to die , the system will then be safe from any inclement weather which should arise before the system can be restarted .",
    "the ccds used for the taos project are described in . the devices",
    "are 2048@xmath202052 e2v ccd42 - 40 chips .",
    "each chip has two amplifiers , which allow for a combined readout rate of 1.8  mhz .",
    "it takes approximately 2.3  seconds to read out the entire frame , which makes our desired 5  hz image cadence impossible without more than 90% dead time . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "we have designed a novel ccd readout method , which we call _ zipper mode _ ( see ) .",
    "as with conventional operation , when reading out in zipper mode , the telescope tracks the sky and stars are imaged onto the focal plane .",
    "however , instead of simply opening and closing the shutter for each exposure , the shutter is left open , and after 105  ms , a `` row block '' of 76  rows is read out .",
    "( the read out operation takes approximately 95  ms , so the readout time plus the exposure time is equal to our required sampling time of 200  ms . )",
    "this is followed by another `` hold '' of 105  ms , then another row block is read out .",
    "this cycle may be repeated for extended periods of time , possibly up to several hours .",
    "note that after 27  row blocks are read out ( 27  row blocks  @xmath20  76  rows  @xmath29  2052  rows , the total number of rows in the ccd ) , photoelectrons from every star on the focal plane will be read out in each subsequent row block .",
    "the ability provided by zipper mode to read at 5  hz comes with a cost in signal - to - noise .",
    "this is due to two properties inherent to zipper mode , and any attempt to alleviate one of the problems exacerbates the other .",
    "first , photons from sky background are collected continuously during each hold and shift , while photons from a star are collected only during a single hold . note that with row blocks of 76  rows , the pixels in a single row block contain photoelectrons collected from a total of @xmath30  holds . with a hold time of 105",
    "ms and a sampling cadence of 5  hz , the average recorded number of sky photoelectrons per pixel is thus a factor of  times brighter than it would be after a simple , 105  ms exposure .",
    "second , it takes just over 1  ms to read a single row .",
    "photons from stars are still collected during this time , meaning that stars will leave streaks as a row block is read out , as can be seen in .",
    "faint stars are particularly vulnerable to this effect of flux contamination by streaks of bright stars .",
    "one could conceivably reduce the sky background using row blocks with a larger number of rows , but this would reduce the effective exposure time relative to the readout time and reduce the measured stellar brightness relative to the brightnesses of the streaks .",
    "we would ideally like the row block size to be an integral factor of 2052 , the total number of rows on the ccd .",
    "( stars near the edges of an image are missing a fraction of their flux , increasing uncertainty on the photometry not only of the edge stars but also of their neighbors .",
    "this effect is minimized if the row block size is an integral factor of the number of rows in the ccd . )",
    "we found the signal - to - noise ratio was highest when the read time was close to the exposure time , and the integral factor of 2052 meeting this requirement is 76  rows .    because of the increased sky background , zipper mode works well only for relatively bright stars . on a dark night , adequate signal - to - noise ( @xmath07 )",
    "can be achieved with a star of @xmath31 , which consequently is the faintest magnitude we use in our occultation search .",
    "this readout mode also requires accurate pointing and tracking throughout the duration of a zipper mode run , ideally to within a small fraction ( @xmath32 ) of a pixel . as shown in , if there are significant oscillations in pointing error , then neighboring stars in a row block can move in different directions from their nominal positions over time .",
    "this can cause a significant reduction in signal - to - noise for closely neighboring stars in a row block due to varying blending fractions over time .",
    "we did find both significant drifts and oscillations in the tracking of the telescopes , as shown in .",
    "reducing the magnitudes of these errors required significant hardware improvements ( see ) and software modifications to the telescopes ( see ) .",
    "these modifications were completed in september of 2005 , so a large fraction of our first dataset suffered from this problem . this will be discussed in @xcite .",

    "torusd_. this daemon connects to the telescope control daemon _ teld _",
    "( see ) over a set of four inet sockets , one for pointing and tracking control , one for the focus control , one for status information and one for miscellaneous control commands .",
    "while we have greatly improved the pointing and tracking capabilities of the system through both software and hardware modifications , we found the pointing was still inadequate for the survey .",
    "accurate pointing ( within 0.3  arc  sec ) must be maintained throughout an entire zipper mode run , which can last as long as 2  hours . as discussed in",
    ", poor tracking can significantly decrease the signal - to - noise performance of the system , so it is desirable to keep the tracking as accurate as possible .",
    "while many surveys have a separate guiding imager , taos has the advantage that images are collected at a high rate , and we use this feature to enable our guiding system .",
    "the guide daemon runs in two modes . during the initial pointing phase ,",
    "we point the telescope to a field center and take a stare mode image .",
    "this image is analyzed to find the actual ra and dec of the image center , and a pointing offset is calculated .",
    "a pointing adjustment command is sent to _",
    "torusd _ , and the process is repeated until the center of the image is within 0.1  pixels of the actual field center . in this way , at the beginning of a zipper run , all four telescopes are pointing to within 0.3  arc  sec of the target field center .",
    "the image analysis routine makes use of the standard software packages _ sextractor _ @xcite and _ wcstools _",
    "@xcite used in conjunction with the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "first , after an image is taken , the _ wcstools _ utility _ imwcs _ is run to find the world coordinate system ( wcs ) keywords to transform ra and dec to pixel coordinates .",
    "second , _ sextractor _ is run to find objects in the image .",
    "third , the _ sextractor _ output is used with the _ wcstools _ utility _ immatch _ to match the objects found by _",

    "the polynomials are of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the fit coefficients .",
    "after the fits are complete , these distortion coefficients and wcs keywords are used to calculate the ra and dec of the center of the image , which is then used to calculate the pointing offset .",
    "the pointing offset is written to the _ guided _  shared memory status segment , which is then read by _ taosd _  and passed to _ torusd _  as a pointing adjustment command .    the second _",
    "mode is the tracking mode . at the end of the initial pointing phase ,",
    "20  guide stars are selected from the stare mode image .",
    "the stars are selected on criteria including moderate brightness ( i.e. bright enough to have good signal - to - noise characteristics but not so bright as to leave significant streaks in the zipper images ) , isolated ( no close neighbors in zipper mode images ) , and they should be spread out through the image so the entire focal plane is well sampled .",
    "note that a set of 32  consecutive row blocks is typically written to each fits file , so there are effectively 640  guide stars in each image .",
    "every 30  seconds , the last fits image that was written to disk is analyzed .",
    "_ sextractor _ is run on the image , and the centroids of the guide stars are found and compared with the original values . a pointing correction is calculated and written to the _ guided _  shared memory status segment , which in turn is read by _ taosd _  and passed as a pointing adjustment command to _",
    "torusd_. we find that the inherent tracking of the system is sufficient that the pointing drifts by much less than 0.1  pixel in the 30  second guiding update period , and _ guided",
    "_  is thus able to keep the pointing correct throughout an entire zipper mode run of up to two hours in duration .",
    "the guide daemon also monitors image rotation throughout the course of a zipper run .",
    "taiwan suffers from frequent earthquakes which can disrupt the polar alignment of the telescopes .",
    "we can thus learn in real time if the telescopes need realignment .",
    "furthermore , _ guided _  reports the visibility conditions throughout the duration of a zipper mode run by monitoring the star count .",
    "each time a zipper mode fits file is analyzed for tracking adjustments , _ sextractor _ reports the number of stars to which it can fit a standard psf .",
    "the star count is compared to the number of stars found at the beginning of the zipper mode run to indicate how the observing conditions vary throughout the run . in our fully automated observing mode , _ taosd _  will interrupt observations if the star count drops significantly .",
    "this usually occurs due to incoming clouds , or if the seeing degenerates due to humidity or focusing problems .",
    "this real - time image quality analysis helps optimize our data collection as we can interrupt a zipper mode run and refocus the telescope if necessary .",
    "the lid is opened and closed by a relatively simple daemon _",
    "clamd_. this daemon will assert an open or close signal to the lid controller on command , and monitor the open and close limit switches on the lid .",
    "the open and close signals are lowered when the appropriate limit switch is hit .",
    "the daemon will also set an alarm if the open or close operation times out , and this alarm will alert someone to fix the problem manually .      the focus control daemon _ focusd _  has two tasks .",
    "the first is to analyze images taken during a _ focus sequence _ to determine the ideal focus position .",
    "a focus sequence consists of a series of one  second exposures taken with secondary mirror at different focus positions .",
    "a total of 17 images are acquired while moving the focus position by 15  @xmath13 m steps . a 1k@xmath201k sub - image from the center of the focal plane",
    "is analyzed using _ sextractor _ to find the average full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of each star in the image , and the focus position and medium fwhm are logged internally . after all of the images have been collected and analyzed , the fwhm data are fit to two straight lines , one line on each side of the point with the minimum fwhm . these fits are then used to calculate the best focus position , which is then entered into a database along with the telescope component temperatures ( reported by _ weathd _ ) and zenith angle of the telescope ( reported by _ torusd _ ) .",
    "the second function of the focus daemon is to monitor the telescope component temperatures and zenith angle throughout a zipper mode run and to look up the ideal focus position in the database .",
    "if the ideal focus position changes , the new position is written to the _ focusd_shared memory status segment , where it is read by _ taosd _  and passed on to _ torusd _  as a focus adjustment command .",
    "ll ih & hour angle home switch position + i d & declination angle home switch position + ch & collimation error + np & non - perpendicularity of @xmath44 and @xmath45 axes + ma & azimuthal polar alignment error + me & elevation polar alignment error + tf & tube flexure + fo & fork flexure + kz and mz & first order correction to declination encoder error + [ tab : pm ]    the system originally used the _ telescoped _",
    "program from the ocaas software package to control the telescope .",
    "however , we found three problems with this code that led us to the decision to write a completely new software package .",
    "first , the pointing model used by ocaas did not accurately represent the pointing actually realized with the system .",
    "the residuals between the model and the true pointing were often as high as 10 arc  minutes .",
    "second , we found it difficult to generate the pointing model under ocaas , where the pointing is adjusted by hand until a catalog star is centered on the image , and this is repeated for several stars .",
    "this was very time - consuming as it needs to be done several times per year ( after earthquakes ) , and it needs to be done for all four telescopes .",
    "it is also difficult to do remotely .",
    "third , we found it difficult to implement a robust communication interface between _ torusd _  and the ocaas software without a significant rewrite of the software .",
    "the replacement daemon , _ teld _ is a multi - threaded program with separate threads dedicated to telescope pointing , focus control , status reporting , and master control ( i.e. a parent thread to monitor the children ) . in addition , when tracking a field a new thread is spawned to control the telescope tracking directly .",
    "this thread runs with an elevated scheduling priority to keep the timing of the control loop accurate . implementing a multi - threaded solution to the telescope control",
    "also required rewriting the driver for the pc68 motion controller card to make it thread safe .",
    "this was done by simply adding a semaphore to the driver which is raised whenever the card is accessed .",
    "the daemon makes use of the slalib positional astronomy library to convert to and from j2000 ra and dec to observed ha and dec ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . a custom pointing model derived from that used by the tpoint software package",
    "is used to convert @xmath46 and @xmath47 to actual encoder angles ( @xmath48 for the hour angle encoder and @xmath49 for the declination encoder ) .",
    "the pointing model used is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are temporary variables , @xmath53 is the geodetic latitude of the site and the ten pointing model coefficients are described in table  [ tab : pm ] .    after implementing _ teld _ ,",
    "we found the typical residuals between the calculated and true positions to be less than 10  arc  seconds . used in conjunction with _ guided _ , we found that we can track to well within 0.3  arc  sec for durations up to at least two hours .",
    "we also implemented an automatic pointing model generation feature to the system .",
    "a set of 40  images is taken at a grid of locations on the sky , and the images are analyzed by _ guided _  to find the actual ra and dec of the centers of the images .",
    "the subsequent arrays of ra , dec , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and epoch are fit using the _ amoeba _ fitting routine adapted from @xcite .",
    "this works much faster than the ocaas method , especially when it must be done to all four telescopes several times a year .",
    "this also allows a new pointing model to be created remotely and automatically .",
    "when the system is in startup mode , _ braind _  will schedule a series of zipper mode _",
    "runs_. at the start of a run , _ braind _  will choose a standard taos field ( see ) based on criteria such as distance from the ecliptic plane , distance from zenith , and number of stars in the field .",
    "the scheduler will then instruct _ torusd _  to point all of the telescopes at the field center .",
    "each telescope will then undergo a focus sequence ( see ) and set the secondary focus to the best position .",
    "once this is completed , each telescope will undergo a pointing correction , as described in .",
    "once all of the telescopes are pointing correctly , a set of three 1  second stare mode images are acquired for diagnostic purposes .",
    "next , the zipper mode sequence is started .",
    "each camera system is sent a start time by _ braind _ , and when the start time is reached , the shutters are opened and zipper mode readout is commenced .",
    "this 5  hz readout process continues for a total of 90  minutes ( as long as the weather remains good and no grb alerts are received ) . throughout the duration of the run , _",
    "will keep the telescope pointed correctly . at the end of the run , a second set of three diagnostic stare mode images",
    "are acquired , also with 1  second exposures .",
    "finally , a sequence of 1  second stare mode images is acquired with pointing offsets of 0.8@xmath23 on a 3@xmath203 grid about the center of the field .",
    "this provides an effective mosaic image of @xmath011@xmath8 centered on the field , which is also used for diagnostic purposes .    throughout a zipper mode",
    "run , _ braind _  will monitor the results of each command and the status of each daemon . if an error occurs , _",
    "braind _  will attempt to recover by restarting any software that needs it and , if necessary , reinitializing the zipper mode run .",
    "if _ guided _  reports bad observing conditions , the zipper run will be aborted .",
    "a new field may be selected at this time based on the scheduling criteria discussed above , and if so _ braind _  will instruct the telescopes to point to the new field . in any case",
    ", the system will then undergo a new focus sequence to refocus the telescopes . if the weather is cloudy , this step will fail due to the lack of stars in the images . in this case",
    ", the system will wait for 300  seconds and reattempt the focus sequence .",
    "this step will be repeated until the weather clears .",
    "if the cloudy weather lasts long enough , a new field may be selected by _ braind _  in the meantime .",
    "every morning , all of the fits images from the previous night ( typically about 40  gb per telescope on a clear night ) are archived to a local raid server in the main control building . once every month or",
    "so , the data are copied to a set of hard drives which are physically brought to academia sinica .",
    "the data are copied to a local data server , and then transfered to the taiwan national center for high - performance computing for backup to tape . finally , the data are copied over the internet to a second raid server located at national central university .",
    "we then have three copies of the data in separate locations for secure , redundant data storage .",
    "the data are subsequently analyzed on using two computer clusters ( at academia sinica and national central university ) with a custom photometry package that will be described in @xcite .",
    "the taos grb response system consists of two components , the _ forwarder _  and the grb daemon _",
    "grbd_. the _ forwarder",
    "_  simply listens to a socket connected to the gcn , and passes the information on to _",
    "grbd_. the purpose of the _ forwarder _  is to run on a machine with a more reliable internet connection than that available at lu - lin observatory .",
    "if the internet connection to lu - lin is down , the _ forwarder _  still receives the gcn packet and keeps trying to forward the packet to _ grbd _  until it succeeds .",
    "we currently run the _ forwarder _  on a computer at the institute for astronomy and astrophysics at academia sinica in taipei .    when _ grbd _  receives a gcn alert packet from the _ forwarder _ , it parses the message and determines whether the reported event can be followed up by the taos system .",
    "if the grb event is observable , _ grbd",
    "_  calculates an observation schedule and passes the request on to _ braind _ , which will interrupt any zipper mode operations and schedule the grb follow - up observations .",
    "taos has the advantage of multiple telescopes operating at the same site , which makes it possible to use different exposure times for the same event .",
    "our observing scheme is optimized to have at least one telescope looking for fine structure in the light curves of bright events with short exposures , and two telescopes taking longer exposures for sensitivity to fainter afterglows . in the future",
    ", we may schedule one telescope to observe in zipper mode at 5  hz to look for very bright and rapidly varying transients . to date",
    ", 10  grb alerts were responded to by the taos system , and two afterglows ( r = 16.5 and 16.8 ) have been detected @xcite .",
    "in order to meet the survey requirements discussed in , a set of fields needed to be found which had sufficient numbers of stars .",
    "this task was complicated by the fact that the taos survey would be using zipper mode readout , as the brighter stars will leave significant streaks in the images .",
    "it was therefore desirable to minimize the numbers of bright stars in the fields .",
    "a set of 167  fields was found , with varying characteristics such as number of stars , ecliptic longitude and latitude .",
    "information on the taos fields can be found on the taos website .",
    "note that this set is much larger than is needed , however a large set was generated for the first phase of the survey in order to evaluate the fields in terms of signal - to - noise as a function of parameters such as sky background , stellar density , etc . after analysis of the first data set , a small subset of these fields will be selected for further observations .",
    "the fields were selected by using the usno  b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "initially , lists of stars were generated in 300@xmath20300 arc second tiles .",
    "these tiles covered all of the sky with declinations in the range of @xmath54 , which corresponds to elevation angles higher than @xmath55 at the lu - lin site . after generating over 4.6  million tiles ,",
    "these smaller sections of the sky were merged into larger @xmath56 lists of stars .",
    "the center of each small tile ( except for those near the declination limits ) became the center of the larger field .",
    "this process ensured overlap , allowing for the ability to maneuver around the bright stars ( @xmath57 ) in the sky . over four million of the large fields",
    "were generated .",
    "a subset of these fields was then selected according to the following characteristics :    * maximum number of stars in the field with @xmath58 . *",
    "minimum number of bright stars ( @xmath59 ) . *",
    "maximum coverage of the ecliptic .",
    "* some control fields away from the ecliptic . * no nebulae or other astronomical phenomena .",
    "these requirements were used to narrow down the list of viable fields .",
    "the field list was refined using a sorting routine to select fields with varying star densities .",
    "the main selection requirement was minimizing the streaks in the zipper mode images while not significantly compromising on the total number of stars .",
    "candidate fields that did not meet these criteria were cut from the list .",
    "fields with nebulae or other phenomena were removed by checks of digital sky survey ( dss ) images .",
    "the dss images were also used to verify the accuracy of the usno  b1.0 catalog , particularly to ensure that there are no bright stars in the field that do not appear in the catalog .",
    "note that it was impossible to meet the stellar density requirement in all of the fields , as most of the fields along the ecliptic are very sparse ( some of these fields have fewer than 100  stars ) .",
    "however , care was taken to find the densest fields available in these sparse regions , and it should be noted that the sparsest fields are visible mostly during the rainy summer months when observing is limited . also note that high priority is given to observations of the densest fields in order to maximize the amount of useful data collected , and that the sparser fields are only observed when necessary due to the season and phase of the moon .",
    "the typical number of stars in the fields observed in our first data set was thus 300  500  stars @xcite .",
    "to test the overall performance of the system we have observed several predicted asteroid occultations .",
    "shows the lightcurves of the occultation of the star tyc  076200961 ( @xmath60 ) by the asteroid _ iclea _",
