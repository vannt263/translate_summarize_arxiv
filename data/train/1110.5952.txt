    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period binaries consisting of a white dwarf star accreting material from a lower - mass main - sequence star that is overflowing its roche - lobe @xcite . in the standard model ,",
    "mass transfer in cvs is driven by angular momentum loss ( aml ) driven by gravitational radiation ( gr ) @xcite and magnetic braking ( mb ) @xcite .",
    "the obital period ( @xmath5 ) distribution of cvs has been summarized by @xcite , which is bimodal with @xmath6 of cvs having period in the range of @xmath7 h , another @xmath6 with @xmath8 min @xmath9 h , and the rest @xmath10 with @xmath11 h. the number of cvs in the period interval @xmath11 h is small , and it is known as the period gap . in seeking a plausible explanation of the period gap in cv evolution , several authors @xcite proposed the `` disrupted '' mb models which are related to the transition of aml mechanisms .",
    "the general ideal is that , mass transfer in cvs above the period gap is primarily driven by mb at a rate rapid enough , making the secondary star out of thermal equilibrium , so that the secondary star is oversized and has larger radius than a main - sequence star with the same mass .",
    "along with mass transfer , the secondary star loses mass gradually , and finally become fully convective when @xmath12 h. aml is now assumed to been caused solely by gr , because mb is vanished .",
    "accordingly the oversized secondary star begins to shrink and underfill its roche - lobe in attempt to reach thermal equilibrium , cutting off matter transfer .",
    "cvs becomes very faint , and virtually unobservable .",
    "when the roche - lobe is filled again due to orbit shrinking driven by gr at @xmath13 h , mass transfer restarts from the secondary star .",
    "most recently @xcite reconstructed the complete evolutionary path followed by cvs , using the observed mass - radius relationship of their secondary stars .",
    "for aml , they adopted a scaled versions of the standard gr loss rate and the @xcite mb law . with suitable normalization parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    ", these recipes provide acceptable matches to the observed data .",
    "the best - fitting scaling factors are @xmath16 below the gap , and @xmath17 above , which describe the mass - radius data signicantly better than the standard model ( @xmath18 ) .    here",
    "we focus on the origin of the enhanced aml below the gap , which has already been mentioned before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one obvious candidate is the residual mb .",
    "generally , the magnetic field of a low - mass star is supposed to be anchored at the interface between the convective envelope and the radiative core . for a fully convective star , such as the secondary star of cvs below the period gap ,",
    "the interface disappears , and mb is thought to be closed . however , there is strong evidence that fully convective stars are capable of generating significant magnetic fields @xcite , which might develop in a different way than low - mass main - sequence stars ( for a discussion see  8.5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "at present it is not clear whether the magnetically channelled stellar winds can produce mb strong enough to be consistent with the model for cv evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in this paper",
    "we will examine other mechanisms that are needed to account for the extra aml .    during the mass transfer processes , part of the transferred mass from the secondary star",
    "may escape from the binary system , carrying away the orbital angular momentum .",
    "aml associated with mass transfer is called consequential angular momentum loss ( caml ) @xcite .",
    "there are several types of caml due to different way of mass loss in the cv evolution @xcite : ( 1 ) isotropic wind from the accreting white dwarf and surrounding accretion disk @xcite , ( 2 ) outflow through the lagrangian points @xmath1 or @xmath19 @xcite , and ( 3 ) a circumbinary ( cb ) disk @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we introduce the basics of orbital evolution and possible caml mechanisms in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we constrain possible aml machanisms to explain the extra aml rate below the period gap .",
    "discussions and conclusions are presented in the final section .",
    "we first derive the relation between the caml rate and the mass transfer rate @xmath20 , following the approach in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume that the total angular momentum of the binary is dominated by the orbital angular momentum , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the binary separation , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the masses of the white dwarf , the secondary star , and the binary system , respectively .",
    "the relation between the binary separation @xmath22 and the orbital angular velocity @xmath26 is given by the kepler s third law , @xmath27 logarithmic differentiation of eq .",
    "( 1 ) gives @xmath28 the obital aml rate in cvs contains two items .",
    "one is the systemic aml due to mb and/or gr ; the other is caml , which is related to the mass transfer rate .",
    "so the total obital aml rate can be writen as @xmath29 when mass is transferred from the donor star to the white dwarf , we assume that a fraction @xmath30 of the matter flow escapes from the cv binary , i.e. , @xmath31 which means that the actual accretion rate of the white dwarf is @xmath32 considering that the caml rate is related to the mass transfer rate @xmath20 , we can write @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a parameter as a function of @xmath35 @xcite . in order to eliminate @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we use the @xcite formula for the roche - lobe ridius @xmath37 of the donor star , @xmath38 logarithmic differentiation of eq .",
    "( 8) yields @xmath39 for a roche - lobe - filling donor star with steady mass transfer , variation of the stellar radius @xmath40 and the roche - lobe radius @xmath41 should be in step , i.e. , @xmath42 to deal with @xmath43 , we use the mass - radius relation@xmath44 and its logarithmic differentiation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass - radius exponent .",
    "@xcite showed that after a cv donor emerges from the bottom of the period gap , the exponent @xmath47 evolves from @xmath48 ( in thermal equilibrium ) to @xmath49 at the minimum period , and finally to @xmath50 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "they adopted broken - power - law fit to the updated @xmath51 data in @xcite , with @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are the secondary masses just below the gap and at the minimum period where the secondary stars become degenerate and the orbital periods start to bounce back into the period - increasing phase , respectively .",
    "adopt @xmath58 and typical white dwarf mass @xmath59 in cvs , @xmath60 decreases from @xmath61 to @xmath62 with decreasing @xmath63 . in the following we calculate @xmath47 by using the @xmath64 relation derived from numerical calculations of cv binary evolution , which is very close to the empirical one in @xcite .    combining eqs .",
    "( 3)-(11 ) , one can derive @xmath65 where @xmath66 here the systemic aml mechanism below the gap is gr , and its rate is given by @xcite @xmath67    next we consider the possible caml mechanisms .",
    "for isotropic wind ( e.g. , outflows due to nova explosions and/or wind emanating from the accretion disk ) , we assume that it carries the white dwarf s specific obital angular mometum @xmath68 , @xmath69 for outflows from the lagrangian point @xmath2 the specific obital angular mometum is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the distance between the mass center of binary and the @xmath19 point . finally for cb disks",
    "we assume that it extracts the orbital angular momentum from the binary by tidal force . the specific obital angular momentum @xmath72 is given by , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is taken as the inner radius of the cb disk .",
    "usually , @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the best - fit revised model of cv evolution in @xcite indicates that the aml rate below the period gap is @xmath76 .",
    "this means that some other aml machanisms besides gr should work . in the following",
    "we will discuss the feasibility of the aml related to isotropic wind , outflow from @xmath77 point , and cb disks , respectively .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 15 ) , we can derive the obital aml rate , @xmath78 of isotropic wind as @xmath79 and hence @xmath80 let @xmath81 and combined eqs .",
    "( 12)-(14 ) and(18)-(20 ) , we have @xmath82 which can be transformed into @xmath83 for cvs below the period gap , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , so @xmath35 is always negative , indicating that the isotropic wind can not provide the extra @xmath86 aml .",
    "this conclusion remains valid if we let most of the material to escape from the @xmath1 point @xcite .",
    "similar as in section 3.1 , we derive the obital aml rate , @xmath88 , of outflow from the @xmath87 point by combining eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 16 ) , @xmath89 which gives @xmath90 then we obtain the following relation @xmath91 after simplification we have @xmath92 where @xmath93 . for different @xmath94 ,",
    "the values of @xmath95 are given in @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath35 and @xmath94 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is seen that the required value of @xmath96 ranges from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "the origin of the cb disks may stem from the remnant of the late stage of the common envelope evolution phase that formed the cvs , or matter outflow from cvs during the mass transfer processes @xcite . through tidal interaction of the cb disk and cvs binary , the cb disk can extract obital angular momentun from binary if part of the transferred mass flows into the disk rather onto the white dwarf .",
    "the corresponding aml rate is , @xmath99 then we can derive @xmath100 the relation between @xmath35 and @xmath94 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the value of @xmath96 lies between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , comparable with that in the case of outflow from the @xmath2 point .",
    "the above result is under the assumption that aml is only caused by mass loss .",
    "actually there is gravitational torque between the cb disk after it is formed and the binary , which is more efficient to extract angular momentum from the binary @xcite .",
    "the aml rate under this torque can be expressed as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the time since mass transfer begins , and @xmath105 is the viscous timescale at the inner edge of the cb disk , given by @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the viscosity parameter @xcite , and @xmath108 is the ratio of the scale height to the radius of the disk",
    ". equation  ( 28 ) can be further simplified to be @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "similar as the derivation of eq .",
    "( 20 ) , we obtain the following relation for the cb disk , @xmath111 previous investigations @xcite suggest that very small values of @xmath112 are required for cv evolution .",
    "thus the third term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( 30 ) can be neglected .",
    "considering the fact that @xmath113 and @xmath63 also roughly counteract each other , and @xmath114 , eq .",
    "( 30 ) is changed to be @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 @xcite , @xmath118 hr , and @xmath119 yr .",
    "this is close to the result @xmath120 adopted in the numerical calculations by @xcite for cv evolution .    to investigate the effect on aml of the uncertainties in treatment of cb disks we have numerically solved eq .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show the calculated values of @xmath96 as a function of @xmath63 for different values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "it is seen that generally smaller @xmath107 or @xmath108 corresponds to larger @xmath96 .",
    "this is easy to understand with eq .",
    "( 29 ) : smaller @xmath107 or @xmath108 indicates less efficient angular momentum transfer within the disk , which requires more mass input into the cb disk to guarantee enough aml from the orbit",
    ". nevertheless , the values of @xmath96 are always small ( @xmath121 a few @xmath122 ) when we change @xmath107 from 0.001 to 0.1 , and @xmath108 from 0.005 to 0.1 .",
    "this implies that cb disks are indeed very efficient in draining orbital angular momentum through gravitational torques even with a very small mass input rate .    to show how cb disks can influence the evolution of cvs below the gap ,",
    "we have also performed binary evolution calculations adopting an updated version of the stellar evolution code developed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we set initial solor chemical compositions ( i.e. , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 ) for the donor star , and take the ratio of mixing length to the pressure scale height to be 2.0 , and the convective overshooting parameter to be 0.12 .",
    "we follow the evolution of a cv just below the gap with a donor star of mass @xmath56 and an orbital period @xmath126 d. for cb disks we take @xmath127 as one free parameter to assess its influence on the evolution of cvs , since @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath96 are always combined together in evaluating the aml rate ( see eq .",
    "[ 29 ] ) . for typical values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 (",
    "* and references therein ) , @xmath130 . considering the fact that suitable value of @xmath96 may range from @xmath131 to a few @xmath132 @xcite , we constrain the adopted value of @xmath127 to be less than @xmath133 .",
    "larger @xmath127 may cause unstable mass transfer .",
    "the stability of mass transfer can be examined by comparing the roche - lobe radius exponent @xmath134 due to mass loss with @xmath47 @xcite , which are shown in figure 5 as a function of @xmath63 . from top to bottom , the solid curves represent @xmath134 with @xmath127 ranging from @xmath135 to @xmath136 in steps of @xmath136 , and the dashed lines show the mass - radius exponent @xmath47 of 0.8 , 1/3 , and @xmath137 , respectively . since the mass transfer would be unstable when @xmath138 , we can derive that @xmath127 should be @xmath139 to guarantee stable mass transfer .    in figure 6",
    "we present examples of the evolutionary sequences of the donor mass , orbital period , mass transfer rate , and the ratio of total aml rate and the aml rate due to gr ( @xmath140 ) to show the influence cb disks .",
    "the panels from top to bottom correspond to @xmath141 ( i.e. , aml due to gr sololy ) , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath145 ( or @xmath146 ) , the evolution seems similar to that with gr only .",
    "however , the mass transfer processes are actually accelerated , with @xmath10 higher average mass transfer rate and @xmath147 higher aml rate than in the gr - only case .",
    "this tendency becomes more intense when @xmath127 goes up .",
    "when @xmath148 , the average mass transfer rate is enhanced by @xmath149 , and the aml rate @xmath150 becomes @xmath11 times @xmath151 .",
    "these results imply that a tiny fractional input rate ( @xmath152 ) into cb disks can significantly change the evolution .",
    "this is in contrast with mass loss - assissted aml mechanisms , which usually require a much larger fraction of the transferred mass to leave the binary system ( although in real situation there might be multiple mechanisms work simultaneously ) .",
    "the secular evolution of cvs is thought to be driven by the aml .",
    "two mechanisms usually invoked to account for the dissipation of am are gr and mb of the secondary star .",
    "however , this dual loss - mechanism can not completely account for the magnitudes of the mass - transfer rates inferred for some cvs , and for the large spread in the mass transfer rates observed at a given orbital period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "likely additional aml mechanisms include mass loss from the binary during the mass transfer process , which carries away the orbital angular momentum from the binary .",
    "below the period gap in cvs evolution , aml mechanism was usually considered to be driven by solely gr , while the best - fit result with observations indicates that aml rate is about @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "this offers a possibility to constrain the aml mechanisms besides gr .",
    "we consider several kinds of caml mechanisms often invoked in the literature : isotropic wind from the accreting white dwarfs , outflows from the langrangian points , and the formation of a cb disk .",
    "we found that neither isotropic wind from the white dwarf nor outflow from the @xmath1 point can explain the extra @xmath154 aml rate , while outflow from the @xmath77 point or a cb disk is more effective in extracting the angular momentum . for a @xmath155 white dwarf ,",
    "the fraction @xmath96 of mass loss in the total transferred mass is @xmath156 or @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "actually it is found that @xmath35 is allways less than 0.45 for different mass of the white dwarf in our calculations .",
    "note that when mass is lost from the @xmath77 point , it is very likely to form a cb disk around the binary @xcite , so it is not surprised that the values of @xmath96 are very close in these two cases .",
    "when the tidal interaction between the cb disk and the binary is included , the mass transfer rate can be enhanced much more efficiently , and a very small fraction ( @xmath152 ) of mass loss is required .",
    "this will suggest a much lighter cb disk than in the former cases .",
    "the cb disks are thought to be large ( up to several au in radius ) and cool ( a few thousand k at the inner edge to less than 1000 k at the outer edge ) , with peak emission in the infrared @xcite .",
    "although detection of excess infrared emission from magnetic cvs provides observational support for the presence of cool gas ( and possibly a cb disk ) surrounding cvs @xcite , there are still many open questions associated with the formation of the cb disks .",
    "future observations with the measurement of the disk masses might distinguish the ways of angular momentum transfer between the cb disk and the cv binary .",
