    "during the last three decades the investigation of phenomena related with strongly interacting electrons has developed to a central field of condensed matter physics . in this context , high - temperature superconductivity and heavy - fermion behavior are maybe the most important examples .",
    "it has been clearly turned out that such systems require true many - body approaches that properly take into account the dominant strong electronic correlations .    in the past , many powerful numerical methods like exact diagonalization @xcite , numerical renormalization group @xcite , quantum monte - carlo @xcite , the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite , or the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite have been developed to study strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "in contrast , only very few analytical approaches are available to tackle such systems . in this",
    "regard , renormalization schemes for hamiltonians developed in the nineties of the last century @xcite represent an important new direction in the field where renormalization schemes are implemented in the liouville space ( that is built up by all operators of the hilbert space ) .",
    "thus , these approaches can be considered as further developments of common renormalization group theory @xcite that is based on a renormalization within the hilbert space .    in this review",
    "we want to discuss the projector - based renormalization method [ prm , ref .  ] that shares some basic concepts with the renormalization schemes for hamiltonians mentioned above @xcite .",
    "all these approaches including the prm generate effective hamiltonians by applying a sequence of unitary transformations to the initial hamiltonian of the physical system .",
    "however , there is one distinct difference between these methods : both similarity renormalization @xcite and wegner s flow equation method @xcite start from a continuous formulation of the unitary transformation by means of a differential form . in contrast , the prm is based on discrete transformations so that a direct link to perturbation theory can be provided .",
    "this review is organized as follows :    in the next section we discuss the basic concepts of the prm : we introduce projection operators in the liouville space that allow the definition of an effective hamiltonian . if these ingredients are combined with unitary transformations one can derive a new kind of perturbation theory that is not restricted to the ground - state but also allows to investigate excitations .",
    "( to illustrate this point we briefly discuss the triplet dispersion relation of a dimerized and frustrated spin chain in the appendix . ) however , this perturbation theory is not the focus of this review and can be considered as an interesting side - product of the development of the prm , a renormalization scheme based on the same ingredients . to illustrate the method in some detail ,",
    "the exactly solvable fano - anderson model is considered .    improving our previous publications on the prm , we show here the relation of the prm to wegner s flow equation method @xcite for the first time .",
    "it turns out the latter method can be understood within the framework of the prm by choosing a complementary unitary transformations to generate the effective hamiltonian . for demonstration ,",
    "the fano - anderson model is solved with this approach , too .    as a more physical example",
    ", the electron - phonon interaction is studied in sec .",
    "in particular , the prm is compared in some detail with the flow equation method @xcite and the similarity transformation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a possible modification of the prm that allows to derive block - diagonal hamiltonians , and we discuss in some detail the freedom in choosing the generator of the unitary transformation the prm is based on .",
    "finally , we show how phase transitions can be studied within the prm by adding symmetry breaking fields to the hamiltonian .    in sec .",
    "[ pam ] the prm is applied to the periodic anderson model to describe heavy - fermion behavior . whereas the famous slave - boson mean - field theory @xcite obtains an effectively free system consisting of two non - interacting fermionic quasi - particles , here the periodic anderson model is mapped onto an effective model that still takes into account electronic correlations .",
    "thus , in principle both mixed and integral valence solution can be found .",
    "however , here we restrict ourself to an analytical solution of the renormalization equations that is limited to the mixed valence case .    as third application of the prm the one - dimensional holstein model of spinless fermions is discussed .",
    "it is well known that the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a metallic to a peierls distorted state if the electron - phonon coupling exceeds a critical value .",
    "first , for the metallic state we discuss the crossover behavior between the adiabatic and anti - adiabatic case in sec .",
    "[ holstein_cross ] .",
    "all physical properties are shown to strongly depend on the ratio of phonon and hopping energy in the system . in sec .",
    "[ holstein_qp ] , a unified description of the quantum - phase transition is given for the one - dimensional model in the adiabatic case .    finally , as a second example for a quantum phase transition , we discuss in sec .",
    "[ holstein_sc ] the competition of charge ordering and superconductivity in the two - dimensional holstein model . based on the prm both charge density wave and superconductivity",
    "are studied within one theoretical framework .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the concepts of the prm @xcite where we particularly pay attention to a general notation that is used throughout the review for all applications of the approach .",
    "we define projection operators of the liouville space and define an effective hamiltonian where , in contrast to common approaches , _ excitations _ instead of _ states _ are integrated out . in this way , not only a perturbation theory is derived but also and more important a renormalization scheme ( that we call prm in the following ) is established which allows to diagonalize or at least to quasi - diagonalize many - particle hamiltonians . as an illustrative example , the exactly solvable fano - anderson model is discussed .",
    "the prm is based on a sequence of _ finite _ unitary transformations whereas wegner s flow equations start from a continuous formulation of unitary transformations by means of a differential form .",
    "it turns out that such a continuous transformation can also be understood in the framework of the prm if a complementary choice for the generator of the unitary transformation is used and infinitely small transformation steps are considered . to discuss the differences between the two formulations of the prm in more detail",
    ", we also solve the fano - anderson model using the developed continuous approach .      the projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) @xcite starts from the usual decomposition of a given many - particle hamiltonian , @xmath0 where the perturbation @xmath1 should not contain any terms that commute with the unperturbed part @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the interaction @xmath1 consists of the transitions between eigenstates of @xmath2 with corresponding _ non - zero _ transition energies .",
    "the presence of @xmath1 usually prevents an exact solution of the eigenvalue problem of the full hamiltonian @xmath3 so that suited approximations are necessary .",

    "thus , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be interpreted as projection operators of the liouville space that is built up by all operators of the hilbert space .",
    "@xmath17 projects on those parts of an operator @xmath19 which only consist of transition operators @xmath20 with energy differences @xmath21 less than a given cutoff @xmath10 , whereas @xmath18 projects onto the high - energy transitions of @xmath19 .    in terms of the projection operators",

    "new interaction terms can be generated in every renormalization step .",

    "consequently , derived effective hamiltonians might be limited in their possible applications if important operators have not been appropriately included in the renormalization scheme .",
    "if a factorization approximation needs to be performed the obtained renormalization equations will contain expectation values that must be calculated separately . in principle , these expectation values are defined with respect to @xmath4 because the factorization approximation was employed for the renormalization step that transformed @xmath4 to @xmath63 .",
    "however , @xmath4 still contains interactions that prevent a straight evaluation of required expectation values . the easiest way to circumvent",
    "this difficulty is to neglect the interactions and to use the diagonal unperturbed part @xmath8 instead of @xmath4 for the calculation of the expectation values .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to the holstein model to investigate single - particle excitations and phonon softening @xcite . however , it turns out that often the interaction term in @xmath4 is crucial for a proper calculation of the required expectation values .",
    "thus , usually a more involved approximation has been used that neglects the @xmath10 dependence of the expectation values but includes interaction effects by calculating the expectation values with respect to the full hamiltonian @xmath3 instead of @xmath4 . in this case , the renormalization equations need to be solved in a self - consistent manner because they depend on expectation values defined with respect to the full hamiltonian @xmath3 which are not known from the very beginning but can be determined from the fully renormalized ( and diagonal ) hamiltonian @xmath72 .",
    "there exist two ways to calculate expectation values of the full hamiltonian from the renormalized hamiltonian . the first one is based on the free energy that can be calculated either from the original model @xmath3 or the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath73 , @xmath74 because @xmath73 is obtained from @xmath3 by unitary transformations .",
    "the desired expectation values can then be determined from the free energy by functional derivatives .",
    "this approach has advantages as long as the derivatives can be evaluated analytically as , for example , in refs .   and .",
    "the second way to calculate expectation values of the full hamiltonian employs unitarity for any operator variable @xmath40 , @xmath75 where we defined @xmath76 .",
    "thus , additional renormalization equations need to be derived for the required operator variables @xmath77 where the same sequence of unitary transformations has to be applied to the operator variable @xmath40 as to the hamiltonian @xmath3 .      in this subsection",
    "we want to illustrate the prm discussed above by considering an exactly solvable model , namely the fano - anderson model @xcite , @xmath78 the hamiltonian describes dispersion - less @xmath79 electrons interacting with conduction electrons where all correlation effects are neglected .",
    "@xmath80 denotes the wave vector , and the one - particle energies are measured with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "both types of electrons are assumed to have the same orbital index @xmath81 with values @xmath82 .",

    "[ fig_electron_dispersion]a ) , one observes a relatively strong reduction of the bandwidth .",
    "this indicates the tendency to localization in the anti - adiabatic case .",
    "it also indicates that the metal - insulator transition in the anti - adiabatic limit can be understood as the formation of small immobile polarons with electrons surrounded by clouds of phonon excitations . in the present prm approach",

    "as one can see from the most dominant renormalization processes take place for small values of the cutoff @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the largest renormalization contributions come from @xmath193 and @xmath381 values that fulfill the condition @xmath403 from directly follows a second condition for the renormalization contributions to @xmath339 .",
    "due to the expectation values @xmath404 in the renormalization of @xmath339 is caused from the coupling to particle - hole excitations .",

    "let us first discuss the adiabatic case @xmath382 .",
    "the most dominant contributions to the renormalization are expected when both conditions are simultaneously fulfilled .",

    "on the other hand , for @xmath380 , the energy denominator is almost zero so that still some noticeable renormalization structures are found in fig .",
    "[ fig_phonon_dispersion_2]a .",

    "[ fig_phonon_dispersion_2]b and fig .  [ fig_phonon_expect]b ) can again be understood on the basis of the renormalization equations and condition .",
    "as was already discussed , particle - hole excitations lead to the renormalization of @xmath339 . therefore , from the sum over @xmath193 in eq .",

    "the largest renormalization should result from a small @xmath381 region around some @xmath381 vector @xmath392 for which @xmath419 is approximately fulfilled .",
    "since @xmath325 is of the order of @xmath390 , @xmath392 is located somewhere in the middle of the brillouin zone and depends strongly on @xmath325 . from eq .",
    "also follows that renormalization contributions to @xmath377 change their sign at @xmath392 due to the sign change in the energy denominator .",
    "finally , from equation one may point out also the stiffening of the phonon modes in the anti - adiabatic case @xmath400 . in this case",
    "the phonon energy @xmath325 is much larger than the electronic bandwidth .",
    "therefore , for all @xmath10 a positive energy denominator @xmath420 is obtained . nevertheless , for half - filling in the @xmath193 sum on the right hand side of there are as many negative as positive terms due to the factor @xmath404 . since from @xmath421 always follows @xmath422 , the negative terms have larger energy denominators and are always smaller than the positive terms .",
    "the resulting renormalization of @xmath339 is therefore positive for all @xmath381 values and largest for @xmath363 due to the smallest energy denominator .",

    "in particular , the phonon mode at momentum @xmath461 , i.e.  at the brillouin - zone boundary becomes soft if the ep coupling is increased up to @xmath453 .",
    "however , in contrast to the metallic solution of subsection  [ hm_metal ] @xmath377 at @xmath461 always remains positive though it is very small .",
    "note that for @xmath329 values larger than @xmath372 the energy @xmath377 increases again .",
    "this phonon softening at the phase transition has to be interpreted as a lattice instability which leads to the formation of the insulating peierls state for @xmath462 .",
    "the phase transition is associated with a shift of the ionic equilibrium positions .",
    "a lattice stiffening occurs if @xmath329 is further increased to values much larger than the critical value @xmath453 .",
    "note also that the critical coupling @xmath453 obtained from the opening of the gap in @xmath383 is significantly smaller than the @xmath364 value of @xmath463 which was found from the vanishing of the phonon mode at the brillouin zone boundary in the metallic solution of subsection  [ hm_metal ] .",
    "instead , one would expect that both the gap in @xmath455 and the vanishing of @xmath362 should occur at the same @xmath372 value .",
    "this inconsistency can again be understood from the factorization approximation in the prm : as discussed above , the inclusion of additional fluctuations leads to a less stable insulating phase so that a @xmath372 value larger than @xmath464 would follow . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion of @xmath377 due to renormalization processes would be enhanced by taking additional fluctuations into account .",
    "thus , a @xmath372 value smaller than @xmath465 would follow . in this way",
    ", both ways to determine @xmath372 would be consistent with each other and could lead to a common result for @xmath372 in between @xmath464 and @xmath466 .",
    "this would be in agreement with the dmrg value of @xmath467 ( ) .",
    "as a second example for a quantum phase transition , we now study the competition of charge - density waves ( cdw ) and superconductivity ( sc ) for the two - dimensional half - filled holstein model by use of the projector - based renormalization method . in one dimension the coupling of electrons to phonons",
    "gives rise to a metal - insulator transition . in two dimensions",
    "the electron - phonon interaction may also be responsible for the formation of cooper pairs . in the following",
    ", the competing influence of superconductivity and charge order will be discussed for two dimensions .",
    "the prm not only allows to study sc and cdw correlation functions but gives direct access to the order parameters .",
    "the discussion closely follows the approach of ref .",
    "+ the relationship between a possible superconducting and an insulating peierls - cdw phase in the 2d - holstein model has been subject to a number of studies in the literature ( for details we refer to ref .  ) . in general",
    ", it is believed that the onset of strong sc correlations suppresses the development of cdw correlations and vice versa .",
    "thus close to the phase transition , both types of correlations must be taken into account .      to find a uniform description of both the superconducting ( sc ) and the insulating cdw phase , two fields , which break the translation and the gauge symmetry",
    "should be added to the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the model on a square lattice is given by @xmath468 where @xmath294 is the wave vector on the reciprocal lattice and @xmath469 is the characteristic wave vector of the cdw phase @xmath470 .",
    "assuming an electron hopping between nearest - neighbor sites , the electronic dispersion is given by @xmath471 , where @xmath317 is the chemical potential .",
    "moreover , @xmath325 is the dispersionless phonon energy , and @xmath329 denotes the coupling strength between the electrons and phonons . at the beginning of the renormalization the two symmetry breaking fields @xmath472 and @xmath473 , as well as @xmath474 ,",
    "are assumed to be infinitesimally small ( @xmath475 , @xmath476 ) .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath26 can be diagonalized , since its electronic part is quadratic in the fermionic operators .",
    "note that due to the doubling of the unit cell in the insulating phase , in @xmath26 the creation operator @xmath477 is coupled to @xmath478 .",
    "in addition the coupling of @xmath479 to @xmath480 is caused by superconductivity .",
    "therefore , the eigenmodes of @xmath26 can be represented as a linear combination of the following four operators @xmath481    in the renormalization procedure , all transitions with energies larger than @xmath10 will be integrated out .",
    "as can be seen , the renormalized hamiltonian can again be divided into @xmath482 .",
    "if one denotes by @xmath483 ( @xmath484 ) the @xmath10 dependent eigenmodes of @xmath5 the electronic part of the renormalized hamiltonian @xmath5can be written as @xmath485 where the eigenenergies are given by @xmath486 for @xmath487 , whereas for @xmath488 the @xmath489-signs have to be reversed .",
    "note that in the sum of the two order parameters squared enter the energies @xmath490 of .    in order to derive the renormalization equations , the unitary transformation has to be evaluated explicitly .",
    "thereby , also the interaction @xmath6 has to be expressed in terms of the eigenmodes @xmath491 of @xmath5 . moreover , an ansatz for @xmath127 has to be made in analogy to what was done in the previous sections .",
    "the explicit calculation is found in ref .  .      for the numerical evaluation of the renormalization equations",
    ", we consider a square lattice with @xmath492 sites .",
    "the temperature is set equal to @xmath360 , and a small value of @xmath493 is chosen . for simplicity , we also restrict ourselves to @xmath494-wave - like superconducting solutions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1/2 ] , where the @xmath294-dependent symmetry breaking fields @xmath495 ( black ) and @xmath496 ( red ) for @xmath497 are plotted as function of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath329 .",
    "the coupling @xmath329 is restricted to small values @xmath498 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_1/2 ] , for small values of @xmath499 the system is in a pure superconducting state , i.e.  no charge order is present . for small @xmath329 , the superconducting gap increases roughly proportional to @xmath500 . in the intermediate @xmath329 range , @xmath501 ,",
    "a coexistence of both phases is found .",
    "the system is in a combined superconducting - charge ordered phase . here , the @xmath329 dependence of @xmath502 is no longer quadratic as in the small @xmath329 regime .",
    "instead , @xmath502 reaches a maximum value and drops down to zero with increasing @xmath329 . finally , for @xmath503 the superconducting phase is completely suppressed and the system is in a pure charge ordered state .",
    "the aim of this contribution was to discuss the basic ideas of a new theoretical approach for many - particle systems which is called projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) and its application to a number of nontrivial physical problems .",
    "instead of eliminating high - energy states as in usual renormalization group methods in the prm high - energy transitions are successively eliminated .",
    "thereby , a unitary transformation is used where all states of the unitary space of the interacting system are kept . in that respect ,",
    "the prm is closely related to the similarity transformation introduced by wilson and glazek and to wegner s flow equation method though both approaches start from a continuous formulation of the unitary transformation .",
    "the prm starts from a hamiltonian which can be decomposed into a solvable unperturbed part and a perturbation , @xmath504 , where the latter part induces transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath26 .",
    "suppose a renormalized hamiltonian @xmath14 has been constructed which only contains transitions with transition energies smaller than some given cutoff energy @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 can be further renormalized by eliminating all transitions from , roughly speaking , the energy shell between the cutoff @xmath10 and a reduced cutoff @xmath505 , and so on .",
    "this is done by a unitary transformation @xmath506 which guarantees that the eigenspectrum is not changed .",
    "the generator of the unitary transformation @xmath127 is specified by the condition @xmath507 where @xmath508 is the projector on all transitions with energy differences larger than @xmath505 .",
    "the latter condition implies that all transitions from the shell between @xmath10 and @xmath509 are eliminated and lead to a renormalization of @xmath433 .",
    "note that only the equivalent part @xmath510 of @xmath127 is fixed whereas the orthogonal part @xmath511 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "note that this additional freedom can be used in a different way .",
    "whereas in the original version of the prm the remaining part @xmath511 of @xmath127 was set equal to zero for simplicity this part was used in wegner s flow equation method as the only relevant part when the transformation was performed continuously . in this case , the interaction parameters were chosen to decay exponentially . by proceeding the renormalization up to the final cutoff",
    "@xmath512 all transitions induced by @xmath6 are eliminated .",
    "the final renormalized hamiltonian @xmath513 is diagonal and allows to evaluate in principle any correlation function of physical interest .",
    "in particular the one - particle excitations of @xmath514 can be considered as quasi - particles of the coupled many - particle system since the eigenspectrum of the original interacting hamiltonian @xmath13 and of @xmath514 are in principle the same since both are connected by a unitary transformation .",
    "note that the present approach has the advantage of formulating the renormalization quite universally . by specifying the unitary transformation of the many - particle system",
    "both the prm and wegner s flow equation method can be derived from the same basic ideas . however , the stepwise transformation of the prm has its own merits .",

    "[ holstein_sc ] the physical behavior on both sides of a quantum critical point can be described within the same prm scheme .",
    "this seems not the case for the flow equation approach . in particular , by allowing symmetry breaking terms in the unperturbed part @xmath5 , the transformation of eigenmodes of the liouville operator @xmath515 can be followed in each renormalization step .",

    "every dimer can be in the singlet state or in one of the three degenerated triplet states . here ,",

    "thus , triplets can be considered as the basic excitations of the system .    following the ideas of refs . and",

    "are energetically separated because the unperturbed part @xmath2 of the hamiltonian does not change the number of triplets in the system , and the interaction @xmath1 only leads to modest corrections .",
    "consequently , the evaluation of the effective hamiltonian can be simplified if one concentrates on a hilbert space sector with a given fixed number of triplets . in the following",
    ", actual calculations are presented for the two energetically lowest sectors where the system contains no or only one triplet .",
    "the subspace without triplets consists of a single state , i.e. the singlet product state , @xmath531 .",
    "because the effective hamiltonian @xmath532 is obtained from the original hamiltonian @xmath3 by means of a unitary transformation , the ground - state energy can be calculated from @xmath533 here @xmath534 is given by where @xmath535 and @xmath536 is the remaining part of .",

    "note that higher order terms can easily be calculated by implementing a computer based evaluation algorithm as discussed in ref .   where a cumulant method @xcite was applied to the same model .",
    "the case of a single triplet in the system is more complex because a triplet can easily move along the chain .",
    "consequently , it is advantageous to introduce momentum dependent states , @xmath538 and the eigenvalues of this hilbert space sector can be calculated by @xmath539 .",
    "we again employ the useful notation of ref .   and obtain @xmath540 note that the energy gap of the system can easily be determined from eq .   by considering the case @xmath386 .",
    "the @xmath193 dependence of @xmath541 describes the triplet dispersion relation .",
