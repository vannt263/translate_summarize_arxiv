    "however , we shall see that the degeneracy among the various multiplets , and the constraint on the triplet field vacuum expectation value ( vev ) simplify the phenomenology considerably and make the htm more predictive .",
    "in particular , we show that the five  plet members are always heavier than the three  plet members and that the former will always decay dominantly to the latter , giving rise to cascade signatures . for masses in the energy range at lep2",
    "these decays are often three  body , although due to the fermiophobic nature of the five  plet they still dominate . in addition , we show that the decays of the three  plet bosons to the eigenstate @xmath6 and a virtual vector boson are possible and may be dominant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
