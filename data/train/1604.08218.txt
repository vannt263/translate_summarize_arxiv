    "the clf also allows a direct estimate of the agn lifetime or duty cycle as a function of luminosity .",
    "@xcite showed that an estimate of the agn lifetime would be @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the space density of agns with luminosity @xmath24 present in haloes with mass @xmath23 , @xmath32 is the space density of those haloes , and @xmath33 is the hubble time at the @xmath1 of interest . using the clf of agns , the numerator can be replaced with @xmath34 , and , after replacing the halo mass with @xmath35 , @xmath36 can be simply written as @xmath37      as the clf is purely a statistical description of the agn population , it has to be constrained from measurements .",
    "the first important dataset is the xlf ( i.e. , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : clf ] ) , but this is not enough on its own , as even after specifying the halo mass function @xmath21 , there is an infinite number of possible @xmath15  that can result in the measured xlf .",
    "thus , additional information that depends on both luminosity and halo mass is required to determine the shape of the clf .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite for galaxies , the variation of correlation lengths with luminosity , @xmath38 , can provide the needed measurements .",
    "the correlation lengths come from measurements of the agn two - point correlation function @xmath39  which measures the probability above random chance that two random agns within a volume element @xmath40 will be separated by a physical distance @xmath41 : @xmath42dv,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the mean number density of agns in @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "the transition between the two terms occurs at @xmath54  h@xmath55mpc @xmath56 for most agn correlation functions @xcite , so the ` 1-halo ' term will be ignored for determining the clf ( similarly , satellite agns were not considered in models developed by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath57 .",
    "as the ` 2-halo ' term denotes the clustering of agns in separate haloes , then they can clearly be related to the clustering of the haloes themselves , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the ` two - halo ' contribution to the total dark matter correlation function ( defined as @xmath60 ) , and @xmath61 is the mean agn bias at a specified @xmath1 . since @xmath62 can be computed for any interval in luminosity ( eq .

    "the path toward determining the clf for a sample of agns is laid out once a specific cosmological model is chosen .",
    "given a parameterization of the clf , and the xlf and @xmath38 data for the sample in question , predictions for the agn correlation lengths and xlf can be computed using the above equations and compared with the data .",
    "a fitting technique can then be used to constrain the parameters of the clf . as seen above , the procedure involves several quantities that depend only on the cosmological model .",
    "the details of how these are computed in this paper can be found in appendix  [ app : cosmo ] .",
    "the next section applies this technique to two samples of agns , one at @xmath8 and one at @xmath9 .",
    "to determine the clf of a sample of agns using the above framework requires measurements of both the xlf and @xmath38 of the objects in the sample . due to the relatively small survey areas probed in the @xmath19@xmath20  kev  band , this last quantity has been rarely measured .",
    "however , there are determinations of @xmath38 at two different redshifts ( @xmath2 and @xmath9 ) which , despite their relatively narrow luminosity range , can be used to illustrate the insights into agn evolution gained from the clf methodology .    in the calculations described below , rest - frame @xmath19@xmath20  kev  luminosities , @xmath24 , are computed on a grid from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in 531 equally spaced logarithmic steps .",
    "the grid of halo masses spans @xmath66 to @xmath67 in 1000 steps . for computational simplicity ,",
    "[ eq : halo ] is used to generate a grid of radii from the halo masses on which to calculate correlation functions .",

    "these upper limits in radii cause the predicted @xmath47 to roll off at @xmath73  mpc ( see eq .  [ eq : projcf ] ) ; however , most of the @xmath47 data we compare to are at much smaller projected radii and the predictions of @xmath38 are independent of the @xmath47 calculation . therefore , given the appropriate datasets , this setup allows for a well - determined measurement of the agn clf .      for agns in the local universe",
    "there is a measurement of @xmath45 in two different luminosity ranges from the 3-year _ swift_-batcatalog @xcite .",
    "the high luminosity value ( @xmath74  mpc ) is likely overestimated , as it suggests that local quasars are found in cluster - sized haloes , in contrast to observations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is still useful to consider these data because the lower - luminosity point is more accurate , and any luminosity - dependence derived from the clf model may be instructive .    as a further constraint on the clf",
    ", we use the 6 @xmath47 points at @xmath75  @xmath76mpc calculated by @xcite which use the entire luminosity range of their sample .",

    "the clf is determined for @xmath19@xmath20  kev luminosities , while the @xcite data is measured in the _ swift_-bat  @xmath78@xmath79  kev band .",
    "an average agn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) consisting of a cutoff power - law and reflection spectrum is used to convert between the two bands .",

    "reflection is included using the pexmon model @xcite available in xspec @xcite and is added to each power - law prior to averaging so that the fe  k@xmath85  equivalent width is @xmath86  ev . the final sed is consistent with observations of many samples of local agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) as well as the average spectrum derived by fitting the local xlfs @xcite . the total luminosity range covered by the @xcite @xmath47 data",
    "is estimated to be @xmath87 which , according to the agn template , corresponds to @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath2 @xmath19@xmath20  kev xlf data is taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the reason for including the @xcite estimate ( which is a de - evolved measurement and therefore model dependent ) is that x - ray background synthesis models employing the @xcite xlf overpredict the local _ swift_-bat  number counts @xcite . noting this problem , @xcite provided a corrected local @xmath19@xmath20  kev xlf that lies between the @xcite and @xcite data , but will also fit the _ swift_-bat  number counts .",
    "thus , a more accurate measurement of the local agn population is obtained by including both the @xcite and @xcite xlf datapoints .",
    "a negative consequence of this decision is that , because the two xlfs are offset for each other , a single xlf model will be a poor statistical fit to these data .",
    "combining these two xlf measurements with the correlation measurements described above yields 32 datapoints available for fitting the clf .",
    "now that the necessary data are collected , a form for the agn clf must be decided upon and parameterized . as the clf is statistical in nature",
    ", there is freedom to fix the form so that it ` makes sense ' .",
    "for example , the xlf at most redshifts is well described by a broken power - law , so integrating the clf over halo mass ( e.g. , eq .",
    "[ eq : clf ] ) should give a broken power - law .",
    "similarly , hod modeling of agns indicate that @xmath89 also has a roughly power - law shape @xcite , so integrating the clf over luminosity ( e.g. , eq .",
    "[ eq : avgn ] ) also should yield a power - law .",
    "this power - law , however , can not rise indefinitely , so a cutoff halo mass that can depend on agn luminosity should be included .",
    "these considerations lead to the following form for the agn clf : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 fixing the low luminosity slope at @xmath93 ( equal to the low - luminosity slope of the @xcite xlf ) leaves 6 free parameters to constrain by fitting the xlf and correlation data : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99",
    ". we can simplify the process slightly by noting that , although the mass function @xmath21  is defined down to @xmath100  m@xmath6 , galaxies ( and therefore agns ) are not typically found in haloes with @xmath101  m@xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; thus , @xmath102 for those masses .",
    "other assumed forms for the clf ( e.g. , log - normals , power - laws , exponentials ) did not provide acceptable fits to the xlf data .",
    "while more complex forms could provide equally good fits to the data , the parameterization shown above appears to be the simplest clf description supported by the available data .",
    "of course , as additional @xmath38 data becomes available , particularly at higher luminosities , this parameterization may have to be revised .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath38 in two luminosity ranges for agns at @xmath103@xmath104 in five different deep x - ray surveys , yielding 10 different measurements of @xmath38 .",
    "the values of @xmath45 determined from the _ chandra _  deep field south are much larger than the other fields ( likely due to the large supercluster in the field ) and is omitted from the clf fits .",
    "specifically , we use the @xmath45 data in the clf model , and not the ` corrected ' @xmath105 values listed by @xcite that attempts to account for the finite area of the surveys . in practice , these two estimates of the correlation length are almost always consistent within the errors .",
    "as with the @xmath2 field , the @xmath38 data is augmented with the @xmath47 profile measured by @xcite using their entire @xmath106 sample with the measurements at the largest and smallest @xmath48 omitted in the calculations for the reasons described above . finally , @xcite work with luminosities in the @xmath107@xmath108  kev  band , and the same agn sed described for the @xmath8 data is used to convert these into the @xmath19@xmath20  kev  band .",
    "therefore , the @xcite @xmath47 data , that spans @xmath109 , converts to the range @xmath110 .",
    "the xlf data for the clf fitting is taken from the @xmath111@xmath112 panel in the @xcite measurement of the evolving xlf .",

    "as shown by @xcite and described in appendix  [ app : light - cone ] , the clf equations can be adapted so that an ` effective ' @xmath21  and @xmath59 , defined over the necessary @xmath1 range , is used in place of the ones calculated at a single redshift . in practice , this correction is too small for the redshift range applicable here , and so is not used for the current calculation .      for both redshifts ,",

    "this whole procedure is done 10 times for each fit , resulting in @xmath129 models within the confidence region at @xmath130 and @xmath131 models at @xmath9 .",

    "[ sub : clfintro ] , the agn clf can be used to estimate the agn lifetime as a function of luminosity by computing the fraction of haloes that host agns at a given luminosity . since there is a one - to - one correspondance between luminosity and mean halo mass ( fig .",

    "the transition in lifetimes again indicates the two modes of agn fueling physics that operates at low and high luminosity .      despite rapid progress in technology ,",

    "below , we use the @xmath4 agn clf derived above to illustrate three ways the clf can assist cosmological simulations in their treatment of agns .",
    "the first possibility is to update the idea of abundance matching by considering the halo mass dependence of the xlf .",

    "an alternative way of doing the assignments of agns numerically is through probabilities , and by using the clf we can calculate the agn halo mass probability density function @xcite , defined as @xmath177 this quantity , which is plotted for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in figure  [ fig : halopdf ] , shows how probable it is for agns to be hosted by haloes of a given mass , and can be used in conjunction with the traditional abundance matching technique .    ) in different luminosity bins at @xmath145 .",
    "this type of plot can be used to populate agns with the appropriate luminosities in dark matter haloes in cosmological simulations.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as long as the computed halo mass function is compatible with the @xcite used here , then populating haloes with these probability density functions should automatically reproduce the agn xlf at the appropriate redshift .",
    "the luminosity - dependent agn correlation function is a further constraint to the agn population that has not often been used when populating haloes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : agncf ] , the clf - predicted @xmath39 for @xmath9 agns in different luminosity bins are plotted .",
    "as found by observations @xcite , the correlation length increases with luminosity , and this behavior is captured by the clf . combining these correlation functions with either of the two changes to the abundance matching techniques",
    "described above will allow cosmological models to more accurately include the effects of agns in the growth of galaxies in a more observationally - rigorous manner .",
    "for example , once the clf results are used to populate agns in haloes at a specific @xmath1 , the simulation can be used to examine the history or future of those haloes , and make predictions for how the clustering and fueling of those agns have changed or will change with time .",
    "the central aspect of the clf methodology is that it naturally produces a luminosity - dependent agn hod model .",
    "however , measurements of @xmath38 are necessary in order to constrain the clf , and therefore the predictions derived from the clf are limited by the number and accuracy of these measurements . despite this limitation ,",
    "there is substantial interest in whether the environment of agn host galaxies is connected to agn observational characteristics such as luminosity and obscuration .",
    "the clf is a valuable tool to examine these questions , especially as further @xmath38 measurements become available over the next decade .",
    "we have decided to use x - ray survey data to constrain and study the agn clf despite the relatively limited number of datasets available compared to studies of optical quasars .",
    "this was done because x - ray surveys provide a view of the agn population that is both unbiased to compton - thin obscuration and covers a substantial range in luminosity .",
    "optical quasar surveys are effective in sampling the high-@xmath1 , unobscured agn population , but are typically sensitive to a narrower range in luminosity than what is found in x - ray surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as we are specifically interested in examining the luminosity dependence of the host halo properties , the x - ray data provides the best constraints .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , the data products produced by x - ray agn surveys may also be biased to more massive host galaxies , as only these will be luminous enough to obtain a redshift measurement .",
    "this effect may influence the inferred masses of agn hosting haloes .",
    "bearing this caveat in mind , the results of the previous section shows that the agn luminosity does depend on the halo properties at both @xmath8 and @xmath3 . this luminosity dependence grows stronger as the universe ages , and can be reasonably interpreted as demonstrating two different modes of agn triggering .",
    "one mode can generate short - lived high - luminosity quasars at any @xmath1 ; these objects are rare and therefore typically populate high mass haloes , but , if the environment is correct , the agn luminosity does not depend on the halo mass .",
    "these properties roughly translate into a merger triggered agn scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other mode of agn triggering becomes prominant at @xmath178 and produces lower - luminosity agns that are much longer - lived , but with luminosities that depend on halo mass .",
    "these lower - luminosity agns can also be found over a range of different halo mass , and may be triggered by secular processes ( including disk instabilities , minor mergers , galaxy harassment , halo - gas accretion ) that can operate in a wide range of cosmological environments .",
    "the luminosity - dependence of our results makes it challenging to perform quantitative comparisons to previous work .",
    "moreover , differences in assumed cosmology and the @xmath179 conversion lead to additional errors when performing comparisons .",
    "therefore , we will focus on a general comparison between our results and those from the literature .",
    "common values for halo masses found from clustering of x - ray selected agns are @xmath180 ( independent of @xmath1 ; @xcite ) which is roughly consistent with the clf - derived results for lower - luminosity agns at @xmath9 , but misses the strong luminosity dependence at @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite estimate halo masses of moderate luminosty low-@xmath1 x - ray agns using lensing information and find halo masses @xmath181  m@xmath6 , which is in rough agreement with our results .",

    ", they find @xmath186 if they include the cosmos field , and @xmath187 if they omit cosmos , values that are @xmath188 lower than the clf predictions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : biasmass ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the lower @xmath1 and luminosity sample of @xcite has about the same halo mass and bias as the higher luminosity bin , a result that disagrees with the expectation from the clf ( and the @xcite results ) .",
    "interestingly , optically - selected quasars seem to populate haloes with masses about an order of magnitude lower than x - ray select agns @xcite . however , as argued by both @xcite and @xcite comparing clustering results between agns selected at different wavelength leads to strong biases , since the host galaxies properties can be very different between the two samples .",
    "for example , as mentioned above , x - ray selected samples may be biased to higher mass galaxies ( and hence higher mass haloes ) due to the need to obtain host galaxy redshifts .",
    "optical quasars are likewise subject to biases related to the detection of strong emission lines with the correct ratios ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a straightforward comparison between the two sets of results is not possible .",
    "future clf modeling will focus on creating a connection from the x - ray based method to the existing optical clustering measurements at higher redshifts that will test the effects of these biases .",
    "one of the most striking predictions of the agn clfs derived here is the cluster - sized masses for haloes hosting luminous agns ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "this prediction is not supported by observations at @xmath2 , where luminous agns are very rarely found in galaxy clusters , and , indeed , the cluster agn fraction is smaller than the field fraction @xcite .",
    "thus , even though the halo mass found here agrees with the one inferred by @xcite , the large value of @xmath45 used to constrain the clf at high luminosity is likely overestimated and therefore giving erroneous results at these luminosities .",
    "an update to the _ swift_-bat  clustering analysis would significantly clarify the results for local agns .",
    "the situation at @xmath9 is significantly different .",
    "in fact , there are several lines of evidence that luminous agns in @xmath190 haloes are common at @xmath191 .",
    "first , the fraction of luminous agns in clusters rises rapidly with redshift to the point where the fraction appears to be at least equal to that of the field at @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are examples where deep _ chandra _  observations of @xmath136 quasars are finding hot cluster gas emission @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite suggests the possibility that high-@xmath1 cool - core x - ray clusters may be associated with many quasars , but are not - identified due to the glare of the quasar .",
    "lastly , in a study of the agn emission in bcgs , @xcite finds that these galaxies become significantly more radiatively efficient and luminous at higher redshifts and could host quasars at @xmath193 . taken together",
    ", these results all suggest that luminous agn activity at @xmath9 may indeed be common , if not dominant , in @xmath194 haloes",
    ". such a result would be consistent with the major - merger triggering mechanism for agns , as these young cluster environments at high redshifts would allow more frequent interactions between gas - rich galaxies than at lower redshift . as the clusters continue to grow and relax , their velocity disperions increase and interactions become rarer , rapidly reducing the number of luminous agns in clusters to the low values observed today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if this scenario is accurate , the question arises of why do the previous x - ray clustering analyses all tend to give halo masses of @xmath180 at almost all @xmath1 .",
    "the main difference between the clf method and more traditional cluster techniques is that the clf considers the luminosity variation in the clustering , and makes use of the total number density of agns at different luminosities and dark matter haloes at different masses as additional constraints .",
    "this additional information makes sure that the agns are distributed over the range of dark matter halo masses in a way consistent with how @xmath45 varies with @xmath24 .",
    "the clf predictions for the dark matter hosts of quasars is partially based on extrapolations from clustering measurements of lower - luminosity agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the additional clustering data of @xmath191 quasars that will be obtained by _ erosita _ will be required to refine the clf model and explore these predictions in detail .",
    "this paper developed a method to constrain the agn conditional luminosity function ( clf ) , a luminosity - dependent halo occupation model for agns , thereby allowing a connection between agn properties and its cosmological environment .",
    "the method requires the x - ray luminosity function and @xmath38 over a narrow range of redshifts . using the limited data currently available ,",
    "a clf model was constrained at two redshifts , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the agn bias , mean halo mass , agn lifetime , and halo occupation numbers were all calculated as functions of luminosity .",
    "our most important results are :    * the agn bias and mean halo mass show significant luminosity dependence at both redshifts , specifically for @xmath195 .",
    "this likely indicates a change in agn fueling processes from low to high luminosity . * in contrast to earlier clustering analyses",
    ", the clf method predicts that high luminosity agns at @xmath9 inhabit haloes with @xmath5  m@xmath6 , which are the ancestors of local massive clusters . this result is consistent with the observed rapid increase with redshift of the luminous agn fraction within clusters .",
    "these environments provide the right setting for strong interations between the massive gas - rich galaxies needed to fuel luminous nuclear accretion .",
    "additional data from _ erosita _ is needed to further explore this prediction . *",
    "the mean agn luminosity depends on halo mass at both epochs , but only for @xmath196  m@xmath6 ( @xmath2 ) or @xmath197  m@xmath6 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we find @xmath144 at @xmath2 and @xmath198 at @xmath199 indicating that agns are spread over a wider mass range for each luminosity at low redshift .",
    "* agn lifetimes are @xmath200  yrs for all luminosities and redshifts , and are @xmath201  yrs for the highest luminosities . *",
    "the clf - derived results strongly support the idea that at @xmath202 agn triggering evolves from a merger - dominated regime which is only weakly dependent on halo mass to one where the majority of agns are triggered by secular processes , including interactions with neighbours ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high luminosity quasars must still be fueled by a catastrophic interaction with another gas rich galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but such events are rare in the nearby universe . *",
    "as the clf method provides a statistical connection between agn luminosity and host halo masses , it can be used to populate dark matter haloes in cosmological simulations with agns of different luminosities in a logical and self - consistent manner .",
    "the clf method described here relies on the accuracy of the underlying observations . if certain datapoints are biased in some manner ( such as the high-@xmath24 @xmath45 point at @xmath2 ;",
    "[ fig : fitsz0 ] ) then the clf - derived statistics will inherit that bias . however , as observations improve with future observatories and campaigns , the clf method can quickly incorporate the new data and produce increasingly more accurate predictions .",
    "for example , recent work by @xcite indicate that @xmath38 may decrease at @xmath203 ( see also the models of @xcite ) .",
    "if this result is confirmed by future observations , the clf framework can account for it by simply revising the underlying clf parameterization ( eq .  [ eq : clfform ] ) . in general , future @xmath38 measurements in the x - ray band",
    "will provide the most important improvement to the clf - derived results .",
    "future development of the clf method will occur in two directions .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the first direction will focus on including the results from the optical quasar clustering measurements .",
    "additionally , we will also develop a model for the 1-halo term in the agn correlation function .",
    "the 1-halo term dominates at separations @xmath204",
    "h@xmath55mpc and arises from pairs of agns within a single halo ( e.g. , a central and satellite galaxy ) .",

    "<S> deep x - ray surveys have provided a comprehensive and largely unbiased view of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) evolution stretching back to @xmath0 . however , it has been challenging to use the survey results to connect this evolution to the cosmological environment that agns inhabit . </S>",
    "<S> exploring this connection will be crucial to understanding the triggering mechanisms of agns and how these processes manifest in observations at all wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> in anticipation of upcoming wide - field x - ray surveys that will allow quantitative analysis of agn environments , this paper presents a method to observationally constrain the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) of agns at a specific @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> once measured , the clf allows the calculation of the agn bias , mean dark matter halo mass , agn lifetime , halo occupation number , and agn correlation function  all as a function of luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the clf can be constrained using a measurement of the x - ray luminosity function and the correlation length at different luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the method is illustrated at @xmath2 and @xmath3 using the limited data that is currently available , and a clear luminosity dependence in the agn bias and mean halo mass is predicted at both @xmath1 , supporting the idea that there are at least two different modes of agn triggering . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the clf predicts that @xmath4 quasars may be commonly hosted by haloes with @xmath5  m@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these ` young cluster ' environments may provide the necessary interactions between gas - rich galaxies to fuel luminous accretion . </S>",
