    "coronal lines are used as a tool to investigate the intermediate region between the nlr and blr ( e.g.  osterbrock 1981 ; appenzeller & streicher 1988 ; giannuzzo et al .",
    "coronal lines are highly ionized emission lines originating from forbidden transitions with an ionization potential of at least 90 ev .",
    "coronal lines are therefore also called forbidden high - ionization lines , abbreviated as fhils .",
    "the existence of forbidden lines indicates that in the respective region the densitites are low enough that the forbidden transitions are not suppressed by collisions .",
    "the critical densitites are of the order of @xmath0@xmath1  @xmath2 . due to the high ionization potential ,",
    "coronal lines are an indication of highly energetic processes .",
    "the density and temperature of the coronal line region are of the order of 10@xmath3 @xmath2 and 10@xmath4 k ( erkens , appenzeller & wagner 1997 ) .",
    "these conditions are similiar to those of the partially ionized gas producing the o  vii and o  viii absorption edges observed with asca , called the warm absorber ( e.g.  nandra & pounds 1992 ; reynolds & fabian 1995 ) .",
    "the warm absorber is presumably located between the blr and the nlr , and it is found in approximately half of seyfert  1 galaxies ( reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "coronal lines and x - ray absorption edges may form in the same plasma .",
    "further support for a connection between the warm absorber and the fhils is given by a correlation between the rosat pspc spectral index and the equivalent width of [ fe x ] 6375   found by erkens , appenzeller & wagner ( 1997 ) for an optically selected sample ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "[ fe x ] 6375   is a good probe of the fhil plasma because , as a rule ,    this line is relatively strong .",
    "furthermore , lower ionization lines such as [ fe vii ] can be stimulated thermally as well .",
    "if there is a connection between the warm absorber gas and the fhil plasma , one can use line profiles of fhils to derive the kinematics and dynamics of the warm absorber due to the higher spectral resolution in the optical than in the x - ray range .",
    "a connection may also answer the question of whether the same ionization mechanism drives fhils and the warm absorber .    to investigate this question , we observed an x - ray selected sample of 16 seyfert galaxies in the optical range .",
    "line properties of a further 4 objects were taken from the literature .",
    "the selection criterion was that o vii and o viii absorption edges were observed with asca .",
    "nearly half of the objects are nls1s ( 10 out of 21 ) , the other half are seyfert  1s , and one object is a seyfert  2 .",
    "though nls1s are defined by optical criteria , our sample was x - ray selected .",
    "then , why are so many nls1s in our sample ? optically selected seyfert  1 samples contain approximately 10% nls1s ( stephens 1989 ) ; this percentage rises to 1650% when the sample is selected by soft x - ray criteria ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "so , the percentage of 50% is at the upper limit given for soft x - ray selected samples . to check",
    "how significant the considered correlation is , we calculated correlation coefficients , specifically the value of kendall s @xmath5 . the kendall @xmath5 value of the correlation between the rosat pspc spectral index and the equivalent width of [ fe x ] 6375   for the objects of the optically selected sample of erkens , appenzeller & wagner ( 1997 ) is 0.55 , corresponding to a probability of 0.09% that the distribution is only by chance .",
    "the correponding values for the x - ray selected sample ( see figure  2 ) are 0.21 and a probability of 11% .    with the spectral index alone , one can not determine if the correlations shown in figures  1 and 2 really demonstrate a connection between the warm absorber and the coronal lines ( rosat spectra can appear steep due to the presence of a warm absorber , but they can also be intrinsically steep ) .",
    "the optical depths of the o  vii and the o  viii edges give direct information about the warm absorber .",
    "they correlate with each other , as shown in figure  3 .    for the optically selected sample alone",
    "a comparison between equivalent width and optical depth is not possible since asca data are available for only three objects of this sample . in figure  4 ,",
    "the optical depth of the o  vii edge is plotted against the equivalent width of the [ fe x ] 6375    line .",
    "no correlation can be seen .    but",
    "how can one explain the correlation between the rosat spectral index and the equivalent width ?",
    "the rosat spectral index might not be a good indicator of the strength of the warm absorber : no correlation can be found between the optical depth of the absorption edges and the rosat spectral index ( see figure  5 ) . however , the x - ray spectral shape can be changed if emission and reflection spectra are considered ( netzer 1993 , 1996 ) , reducing the absorption edges .",
