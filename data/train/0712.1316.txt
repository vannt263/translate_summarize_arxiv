    "in the standard cosmological model the mass density of the universe is dominated by collisionless dark matter .",
    "structure within the universe forms as a result of small density fluctuations , which induce gravitational clustering . in this picture , smaller objects collapse and undergo mergers to form larger objects .",
    "dark matter halos , in which galaxies are believed to be embedded , form in this way .",
    "these halos form gravitational potential wells , which collect gas necessary for star formation , creating a visible galaxy ( e.g. , lacey & cole 1994 ) .",
    "much observational work has been carried out to aid our understanding of the history of mass assembly in galaxies to test these ideas .",
    "whilst dark matter halos build up through hierarchical methods , governed primarily by density fluctuations in the early universe , the assembly of stellar content is far more complex .",
    "it is clear that gaseous dissipation , the mechanics of star formation , and the feedback of stellar energetic output of the baryonic material of galaxies must all be considered in understanding stellar mass build - up , along with the assembly of galaxies through merging and accretion of existing stellar systems .",
    "there are two popular ideas for explaining how the bulk of stars in galaxies are put into place , namely the monolithic collapse , and the hierarchical model .",
    "both of these models predict how disk galaxies and ellipticals form . in the monolithic collapse scenario stars",
    "are concentrated into a bulge due to a rapid collapse of either gas , or existing stars , contained by its dark matter halo .",
    "this bulge can then acquire a disk by cooling of gas from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) onto the spheroid , with star formation occurring as the gas clouds collide ( steinmetz & navarro 2002 ; abadi et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this model ,",
    "different galaxy morphologies form due to discrete differences in environment , and the amount of matter present . in the hierarchical model ,",
    "spiral bulges are a result of the merging of existing stellar and gaseous systems .",
    "these mergers lose angular momentum through the ejection of material leading to high stellar concentrations in the central regions , comprising of both existing stars and those formed out of the colliding gas .    whilst there is evidence for massive galaxies forming hierarchically from mergers , creating elliptical galaxies and bulges ,",
    "the formation process for disk galaxies remains largely unknown .",
    "one way to test this is through the tully - fisher relation between a galaxy s luminosity and its maximum rotational velocity ( v@xmath5 ) , as well as the evolution of this relationship , and its internal scatter .",
    "a more fundamental stellar mass tully - fisher ( smtf ) relation also exists , whereby a galaxy s luminosity is substituted by its stellar mass ( m@xmath4 ) .",
    "bell & de jong ( 2001 ) and verheijen ( 2001 ) both found a tight correlation between maximum rotational velocity and stellar mass , and k - band luminosity , for disk galaxies in the local universe .    to search for evolution in the smtf relation conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) examined the smtf relation at @xmath7 with respect to the @xmath8 relation ( bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) found that the relationship between stellar mass and v@xmath5 does not evolve significantly up to @xmath9 . since stellar mass in disks at @xmath1",
    "must be increasing due to observed star formation , the conclusion from this work is that disk galaxy formation at @xmath0 is hierarchical - gas is accreted along with dark matter in a manner which preserves the stellar mass tf relation .",
    "there is also no evolution in the stellar mass - total halo mass relation at the same redshifts ( conselice et al .",
    "2005a ) , suggesting that the stellar and dark mass components of disk galaxies grow simultaneously throughout this period .",
    "this result was later also found to be the case by e.g. , flores et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and bohm & ziegler ( 2006 ) .",
    "another feature of the stellar mass - tf relation at high redshift is that there is a significant scatter from the best fit relation .",
    "the origin of this scatter is a major question that has been addressed in several previous works ( e.g. , kannappan , fabricant & franx 2002 ; kassin et al .",
    "the origin of the scatter in the tf relation can be the result of different mass to light ratios , different formation histories in terms of star formation and mass assembly , or intrinsic to disks themselves . by examining the stellar mass tully - fisher we are removing the mass to light ratio differences and thus can test whether the scatter is due to formation histories and/or is intrinsic , or otherwise due to observational errors . for high - redshift galaxies kassin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) examined the internal kinematics of @xmath0 galaxies with a range of galaxy morphologies , and found that the tf relation is highly morphologically dependent .",
    "non - disturbed spirals form a clear ridge - line in the tfr that follows the local relation .",
    "almost all major mergers , disturbed , and compact galaxies have lower rotational velocities compared to the @xmath8 values , producing a large scatter . a larger scatter in the tf relation is also found for galaxies in close pairs with kinematic disorders ( barton et al 2001 ) , and for irregular galaxies ( kannapan et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "recently , flores et al .",
    "( 2006 ) related the deviations from the tf relation with kinematic properties of galaxies using integral field unit ( ifu ) observations .",

    "the majority of galaxies with perturbed kinematics were found within the 3 @xmath10 scatter quoted by conselice et al ( 2005a ) , and galaxies with very complex kinematics deviated the most .",
    "these galaxies deviate from the stellar mass tf relation due to too high or low rotational velocities , at a given stellar mass , produced by disturbed kinematics .",
    "if these eventually form well ordered disk galaxies and move onto the @xmath8 line , this evolution may result from their stars and gas settling into more circular orbits , hence increasing , or decreasing the measured v@xmath5 .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) also found that many disk galaxies deviate strongly from the relation between stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity .",
    "one hypothesis proposed in conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) and tested in this paper is that these galaxies are undergoing accretion of intergalactic matter , or satellite galaxies , which increases both the baryonic and stellar mass at roughly the same rate .",
    "we test this hypothesis in this paper through an analysis of the cas parameters for a sample of 91 disk galaxies used in the conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) study .",
    "if disks are forming hierarchically from stellar+gaseous mergers then the systems which deviate the most from the stellar mass tf relation should display signatures of recent merging or accretion activity in their cas parameters .",

    "the sample used in this analysis is taken from conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) , and initially consisted of 101 disk galaxies imaged with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) with rotation curves measured from the keck telescope , and for which we have deep near - infrared imaging .",
    "these disks were selected to have inclinations @xmath14 in order to remove nearly face - on systems so that rotation curves could be measured . however , no upper limit was set to the inclination , thus it is possible that dust lanes in edge - on galaxies are present .",
    "our sample covers the redshift range @xmath7 , enabling any evolution in structural parameters to be seen over half the age of the universe . for the purpose of image analysis ,",
    "all galaxies were chosen to have no obvious interacting companions , or obscuring foreground stars .    to 160 mm        [ sample - figure ]",
    "high resolution images of these galaxies were taken from two sources , archival hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , and hst wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) imaging .",
    "after removing systems that we could not use , the total galaxy sample used in this project consisted of 91 disk galaxies .",
    "the redshift range was also reduced to @xmath15 to avoid strong morphological k - corrections that can result in ambiguous results ( e.g. , taylor - mager et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the acs wide - field channel ( wfc ) allows deep , wide - field survey capabilities from the visible to nir wavelengths .",
    "this difference however , should not pose a problem when determining cas parameters for these galaxies , since the @xmath16 and @xmath17 indices are sensitive to bulk structures , and are therefore remarkably stable with respect to resolution ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the clumpiness parameter is more sensitive to resolution , and thus has a larger uncertainty in the wfpc2 images .",
    "the acs wfc has a fov of 202 and an optimal resolution of approximately 0.049``/pixel .",
    "the wfpc2 images comprise data from four cameras , the wide - field cameras ( wf2 , wf3 , wf4 ) , and the planetary camera ( pc ) .",
    "the wf2 , wf3 and wf4 have optics that are essentially the same , each having an fov corresponding to a resolution of 0.0996''/pixel .",
    "a total of 52 of the galaxies within our sample are found in hst images taken by the acs wide - field camera ( wfc ) in the groth strip area of the deep survey ( vogt et al .",

    "spatially resolved spectra of these disk galaxies at @xmath18 were fit with a single ( or double ) gaussian profile to each emission line ( or doublet ) , most commonly the [ oii ] doublet , and the [ oiii ] and h@xmath19 lines ( vogt et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the position , amplitude , and width of the lines were found from best - fits to single or double gaussian profiles , and the s / n ratio was calculated within these limits .",
    "the central wavelengths of these profiles were used to construct velocity rotation curves , where the gaussian fit met minimum requirements in height and width of 5 @xmath10 and 3 @xmath10 , respectively . however , the typical value was 10 @xmath10 for both amplitude and width ( vogt et al .",

    "there are however clearly some examples of disk galaxies which appear to have very high asymmetries.,width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    determining the rotation curves for high redshift galaxies can not be as accurately done as for local galaxies .",
    "the sizes of the disk galaxies within our sample are typically just slightly larger than the size of the seeing , and the width of the spectroscopic slit . therefore , wavelength shifts in the observed emission lines from which we measure v@xmath5 represents a combination of the spatial distribution in the disk s velocity and the emission line surface brightness . to correct for this vogt et al . and conselice et al",
    "( 2005a ) adopted a simple exponential model for each galaxy , matching inclination and orientation relative to the slit from measurements from hst images .",
    "the rotational velocities from such models are assumed to have a linear form , rising out to a maximum at 1.5 times the disk scale length , r@xmath21 , and then remaining flat at v@xmath5 .",
    "the seeing was taken into account by convolving the model with an appropriate gaussian , and the model emission lines were fit identically to the spectral data .",
    "iterative adjustments were made to the rotational velocity of each galaxy model until the simulated and observed emission lines matched .",
    "factors such as a misalignment of the slit with the galaxy major axis , and varying inclination are also considered when performing this simulation , as these also contribute to errors in the estimation of v@xmath5 .",
    "it was also necessary to consider the relatively large uncertainty in the scale length ( r@xmath21 ) when estimating v@xmath5 .",
    "conselice et al ( 2005a ) measured the disk scale - length , r@xmath21 , by fitting a two - component model to the surface brightness distribution of each galaxy .",
    "however , they found that the errors in r@xmath21 resulting from this method may be underestimated . an additional uncertainty from the fitted r@xmath22 values must therefore also be considered . in total , the derived measurement of v@xmath5 is inferred with an associated uncertainty of 20%-30% ( conselice et al .",
    "2005a ) .    whilst the above method works adequately for a well formed disk with circular orbits throughout , if a galaxy is undergoing a major or minor merger ,",
    "the v@xmath5 estimate could be either higher or lower than expected for non - merging disks . in the beginning stages of a merger ,",
    "the rotational motion of the two component galaxies may remain intact .",
    "however , at higher redshift , the components may not be spatially resolved .",
    "only the spectra from the outer most parts of this combined system are considered when fitting the simple exponential profile , hence increasing the estimation of v@xmath5 .",
    "conversely , in the central stages of a merger , rotational velocity could be largely destroyed , hence lowering the v@xmath5 estimate . consequently , both positive and negative deviations in v@xmath5 from the @xmath8 tfr could indicate mergers ( see  3.2.1 ) .",
    "the stellar masses used within our sample are the same as those calculated by conselice et al .",

    "this method for calculating stellar mass combines near - infrared ( nir ) luminosities and optical photometry of galaxies with well - known redshifts to estimate stellar masses based on fitting the observed sed to different star formation models .",
    "we utilise models from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) with a chabrier imf to compute our stellar masses ( see also conselice et al . 2007 ) .",
    "unlike other methods of determining stellar mass of galaxies , this has no bias against galaxy type or orientation .",
    "the bands we used in conselice et al .",
    "( 2005a ) to calculate the stellar masses are the k - band ( 2.2 @xmath23 m ) , and the optical bands as observed with the hubble space telescope .",
    "we utilise the cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) parameters ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a , b ; bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) to determine the morphological and structural state of our disk galaxy sample .",
    "cas parameters provide classifications in terms of the concentration of light ( @xmath16 ) , asymmetry ( @xmath24 ) , and the clumpiness ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "each of these parameters , and the apparent total magnitudes , are defined within the petrosian radius aperture of ,    @xmath26    where the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 , is an intensity ratio of the enclosed light as a function of radius ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "more than 99% of the light is contained within this radius for most galaxy profiles , and the light within the radius is the closest estimate to the true total magnitude , assuming a perfect gaussian light profile ( bershady et al .",
    "this radius is dependent only on the surface brightness within a given radius , and no assumptions are made about the shape of the galaxy s light profile .",
    "below we briefly describe the cas parameters and how they are calculated within this radius .",

    "the concentration of light correlates with the bulge to total light flux ratio of galaxies , and their masses ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "thus concentration relates to a galaxy s formation history in a broad sense . for disk galaxies",
    ", concentration is found between @xmath31 , and galaxies with low central surface brightness generally have the lowest light concentrations .",
    "this also corresponds to those galaxies with low internal velocity distributions on average ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) and conselice ( 2003 ) define the asymmetry index ( @xmath24 ) by rotating a galaxy image by 180about its centre , and subtracting the flux values at each pixel from those of its pre - rotated image , @xmath32 .",
    "the intensities of the absolute value of the residuals of this subtraction are then summed over all pixels , and are compared with the total galaxy flux .",
    "the basic mathematical definition of the asymmetry is ,    @xmath33    where the @xmath34-component is a correction for the background noise .",
    "slightly negative @xmath24 values may be caused by the background correction if the galaxy is non - disturbed and compact with small residual values .",
    "asymmetry is sensitive to any feature which produces distorted light distributions .",
    "these include galaxy interactions / mergers , and dust lanes occurring in edge - on disk galaxies ( conselice et al .",
    "star formation causes small scale disturbances , seen as high frequency information in an image , which will also produce asymmetries .",
    "star formation however does not cause as high of an asymmetry signal comparable to the other dynamically induced features .",
    "the asymmetry can also be affected slightly by the effects of projecting a 3-d galaxy onto a 2-d image , especially at very high inclinations ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ) . a high asymmetry , by itself , therefore can not be used to uniquely identify a merger .",
    "n - body models of active ongoing galaxy mergers also show that systems that have recently undergone a merger , or those at the beginning or end , of a major merger , may not appear highly asymmetric .",
    "for this reason the asymmetry index is not sensitive to all phases of merging , and conselice ( 2003 , 2006 ) show that in a given sample the total number of galaxies undergoing major mergers would be underestimated by roughly a factor of @xmath35 if only using the asymmetry parameter .",

    "the dotted line shows the derived relation for systems which deviate strongly from the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the large number of points at s = 0.01 are for those galaxies which are too small to have a correctly measured @xmath25 parameter ( conselice 2003).,width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]      the clumpiness parameter ( @xmath25 ) is a measure of the patchiness of a galaxy s light distribution .",
    "it is defined by conselice ( 2003 ) as the ratio of the amount of light contained in high frequency structure ( within the defined galaxy aperture ) to the total amount of light in the galaxy . in order to compute this quantity ,",
    "the original galaxy image is smoothed by a filter of width @xmath10 to reduce its effective resolution , thus removing all high frequency information .",
    "this smoothed image is then subtracted from the original image to obtain a residual image leaving only the high frequency components .",

    "the inner parts of each galaxy are also not considered in the computation of @xmath25 since they often contain high frequency information unrelated to stellar light distributions ( conselice 2003 ) . since disturbances due to",
    "star formation appear as high frequency information , a large amount of star formation results in high @xmath25 values .",
    "high clumpiness is therefore more prominent in star forming galaxies , while @xmath37 for ellipticals which contain little star formation and appear smooth .      before performing our structural parameter measurements foreground stars , background galaxies , cosmic rays , hot pixels , and light gradients",
    "are removed from the images .",
    "some of these features are removed by the sextractor segmentation maps , while those missed by this process are cleaned by hand .",
    "many of the galaxies in our sample are also found in more that one hst archival image .",
    "we use the image with the highest signal to noise , and the lowest amount of contamination from other light sources , and those in which the galaxy is not close to the edge of the ccd chip .",
    "as we use both i - band ( f814w ) and v - band ( f555w ) images in our analysis , we can compare directly how the cas values change between these two wavelengths .",
    "we find that the c , a and s parameters in the v - band were larger by roughly 3% , 9% and 109% , respectively , compared to the i - band values .",
    "the @xmath16 parameters for the v - band are only higher than the i - band images for 66% of the images .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 parameters the v - band images have parameters higher than the i - band images for 58% and 76% of the images , respectively .",
    "we apply the cas structural parameters to decipher any structural evolution from low to high@xmath38 in our disk galaxy sample , and to determine how this correlates with the scatter from the smtf relation .",
    "it is therefore important to consider how measurements of these parameters change as galaxies become less resolved and fainter due to cosmological effects . to address this , conselice ( 2003 ) simulated nearby galaxies at various higher redshifts to determine the effects of redshift on measuring galaxy structures .",
    "conselice ( 2003 ) find that the asymmetry and clumpiness indices decline , on average , as a function of redshift , and the concentration increases slightly .",
    "the amount of this change using 1-orbit hst images is roughly @xmath39 , @xmath40 -0.25 , and @xmath41 = 0.1 at @xmath42 .",
    "in addition to the cas measurements we also visually classified all galaxies , and found disks that appear to be disturbed or compact , and compared these to the calculated parameters .",
    "the most disturbed , highly asymmetric galaxies are shown in figure  1 .",
    "we find that galaxies with high @xmath24 values in general look by eye more disturbed .",
    "all galaxies with low asymmetries appear as symmetric , and sometimes compact , disks .",
    "more than 80% of the galaxies with @xmath43 are found within the acs images , with three wfpc2 images in this group .",
    "the larger percentage of acs images with high asymmetry values suggests that the image resolution affects the calculation of this parameter .",
    "however , calculation of the asymmetry parameter is mostly dependent on large scale - structures , which are not easily lost through reduced resolution .",
    "therefore it is possible that there could simply be few high asymmetry galaxies in the wfpc2 sample and upon inspection , there were none in which a galaxy appeared highly asymmetric in its large scale structure .",
    "conversely , all galaxies with @xmath44 were found in the wfpc2 images .",
    "we find that 45% of the wfpc2 images have zero clumpiness values in both bands , compared to only 4% in the acs images .",
    "the @xmath25 parameter is dependent on high frequency information , which is lost in low resolution imaging . for the lower resolution wfpc2 images , the galaxy subtends fewer pixels and , combined with the use of only the central region for computation",
    ", there is a very limited amount of information available from which to deduce meaningful clumpiness values .    in several cases a galaxy",
    "could not be measured within the cas system , and was excluded from the sample , since it was too contaminated by light from a neighbouring source .",
    "often this contamination was the result of nearby sources that could not be completely removed successfully .",
    "consequently , cas parameters are calculated for a total of 91 disk galaxies .    to 100 mm        [ sample - figure ]",
    "asymmetry and clumpiness parameters reveal active evolution in the form of interactions / mergers and star formation , respectively .",
    "we thus use the cas parameters to determine how galaxy formation processes correlate with deviations from the smtf relation . given the postulate that galaxies in our sample are deviating from the smtf relation due to mergers , we would expect that galaxies which deviate highly will contain higher asymmetries .",
    "before we can test this , we must examine the methods used to determine the presence of galaxies undergoing active merging .",
    "as described in conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) and conselice ( 2003 ) , a selection of @xmath45 for nearby galaxies will give a nearly clean selection of active ongoing major mergers , uncontaminated by normal galaxies . another way to identify mergers , or galaxies strongly interacting ,",

    "this is certainly the case for nearby galaxies in rest - frame optical light ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "however , since systems that have recently finished a merger , or are at the beginning of a merger , will have settled in their distribution , these deviations will not locate all ongoing mergers ( conselice 2006 ) .",

    "( 2005a ) .",
    "as can be seen , there is significant scatter in the relation between v@xmath5 and m@xmath4 , although there is a clear general relationship between these two quantities .",
    "figure  5 gives a graphical model for how galaxies which do not fall along the smtf can evolve onto it over time .",
    "the processes by which a galaxy can move onto the smtf relation include kinematic cooling from a past galaxy merger , as well as an increase of stellar mass from star formation , and through the accretion of existing satellite galaxies .",
    "whether these processes can occur depends on if a galaxy is located above the smtf relation or below it . if a galaxy is located above the relation , then the only way it can reach the relation is through the growth of dark matter without accompanied star formation , and/or the kinematic cooling of a galaxy after it undergoes a dynamical event with another galaxy , either through a merger or an interaction of some type .",
    "for those galaxies below the relation , the evolution onto the smtf can occur either through stellar mass evolution through star formation , or accretion of satellite galaxies , and/or through kinematic cooling after a merging or interaction event . in all but one case , the evolution onto the smtf relation involves hierarchical growth .",
    "we can rule out interactions with other galaxies that do not involve merging , as our disk galaxy sample do not have any nearby companions .",
    "therefore , any evolution on the smtf relation in the v@xmath60 direction involves either kinematic cooling from a merger , or the accretion of matter from the intragalactic medium .",
    "evolution onto the smtf from galaxies above the relation therefore must involve some type of dynamical accretion or merging event .    on the other hand , it is possible that galaxies below the smtf reach the relation over time through star formation .",
    "the other possibility is that the scatter in the smtf relation at these redshifts is purely due to observational errors . by correlating this scatter with galaxy structure , and determining the significance of any trends",
    ", we can make this distinction .      to examine how structure correlates with the scatter in the stellar mass tf relation , we split our galaxy sample into two redshift bins , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we determine deviations from the smtf based on the best fit to the observed smtf relation using our own data , and to the @xmath8 relation .",
    "the zero point of the bell & de jong ( 2001 ) @xmath8 smtf relation was fit such that the standard deviation from the line was at a minimum . for the @xmath52 systems this was found to be :    @xmath63    and for @xmath20",
    "the relation we fit is ,    @xmath64    these derived relations are both within the error bounds of the local relation found by both conselice et al ( 2005a ) , and bell & de jong ( 2001 ) .",
    "this is consistent with no large scale evolution of the smtf relation over the redshift range @xmath65 . hence",
    ", we will assume that our best fits in eq 7 & 8 describe the smtf relations at their respective redshifts .",
    "if we utilise either the @xmath8 relation , or these internal fits , we find very similar results in what follows .",
    "galaxies which deviate by more than 3 @xmath10 from the smtf relation were visually inspected for disturbances , and the cas parameters analysed for any trends . over redshifts",
    "@xmath15 , we found that deviating galaxies covered a large range of asymmetry values , @xmath66 .",
    "we also checked if any deviating galaxies appear as either face - on or edge - on disk galaxy systems .",
    "face - on galaxies could have inaccurate v@xmath5 estimates , and dust lanes may affect the asymmetries of edge - on galaxies . when looking at images of deviating galaxies , only one galaxy appears face - on , displaying a central bar structure .",
    "deviations in terms of v@xmath5 and m@xmath4 from the best fit @xmath8 relations ( eq 7 & eq 8) were calculated in each of our two redshift bins .",
    "deviations are such that if the value is higher than predicted by the smtf relation , then the residual is negative .",
    "these deviations were compared with the asymmetry and clumpiness parameters .",
    "first , we found no clear and obvious relation between highly deviating galaxies and the asymmetry parameter for galaxies at @xmath52 .",
    "however , figure  6 and figure  7 show the relation between v@xmath5 deviations from the smtf relation , and the asymmetries of these galaxies at @xmath20 , where we do see a significant correlation within the i - band and v - band images , respectively .",
    "we fit a line to the v@xmath5 residuals , as a function of asymmetry , weighted by the errors in the deviation in v@xmath5 .",
    "this fit is shown in figure  6 as a solid green line . however , a better fit was obtained if the two high a galaxies , indicated with blue triangles , were excluded . the standard deviations in the scatter place the points on this new relation , which is shown as a blue dashed line .",
    "for galaxies in the v - band imaging , a weighted best - fit line was derived , shown as the solid green line in figure  7 . although no points have been excluded , this relation is less reliable since there are only 13 v - band galaxy images at @xmath20 .",
    "however , a positive correlation is seen in both figure  6 and figure  7 .",
    "we utilise monte carlo simulations to test the validity of these correlations , and to compare whether this increase in asymmetry with smtf residuals is significant given the large uncertainties in measuring m@xmath4 and v@xmath5 . to carry out this monte carlo simulation we place each data point randomly along its v@xmath5 error - bar .",
    "this simulation was repeated 100,000 times , and we find that the significance of the correlations are 3 @xmath10 and 1 @xmath10 , for the i - band and v - band deviations from the @xmath8 line , respectively .",
    "the actual significance of these correlations is likely even higher than this , as these errors likely have a normal distribution .",
    "as explained in  2.2 , both positive and negative deviations in v@xmath5 could indicate mergers .",
    "therefore , we also studied the equivalent of figure  6 and figure  7 for the absolute residuals in v@xmath5 from the @xmath8 line .",
    "no significant trend ( 1 @xmath10 ) was seen in this data , showing that not all highly deviating galaxies have high a values .",
    "it also shows that on average galaxies with a higher asymmetry have a larger positive deviation in v@xmath5 from the best fit smtf relation .",
    "since a high asymmetry index can be produced through both mergers / interactions and star formation , we investigate whether the correlation between the asymmetry and deviations from v@xmath5 are produced by star formation . to investigate this ,",
    "a new parameter @xmath67 is computed for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "this new parameter indicates in a sense ` true ' asymmetries , with the contribution from star formation and dust removed by the clumpiness parameter which correlates with small - scale features in a galaxy ( conselice 2003 ) . the relation between @xmath68 and the smtf relation residuals",
    "is shown in figure  8 .",
    "we find no major change to the trend seen in figure  6 between the asymmetry itself and the smtf relation residuals , suggesting that this correlation is produced through large - scale features in a galaxy .",
    "the two galaxies with high asymmetries in figure  6 also have high @xmath25 parameters , and their positions have moved significantly , and they no longer deviate strongly from the trend .",
    "the original asymmetry values for these galaxies are thus clearly affected by star formation , but the vast major of asymmetries are not .",
    "whilst deviations in v@xmath5 from the @xmath8 tfr are useful for identifying galaxies which may have undergone kinematic changes , deviations in m@xmath4 may indicate either star formation or stellar mass accretion (  3.2.1 ) .",
    "galaxies which have large positive deviations in m@xmath4 resulting from a merger would be expected to have high asymmetry values .",
    "such a relation can be seen in figure  8 .    in general , galaxies that display a higher positive deviation in the smtf relation residuals in m@xmath4 space have higher computed asymmetries .",
    "monte carlo simulations of this correlation shows that this result is significant at @xmath69 3 @xmath10 .",
    "however , an exception to this is one galaxy which has a high positive deviation in m@xmath4 , despite its relatively low asymmetry ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the asymmetry parameters measured from the v - band images showed a similar trend to that seen in figure  9 , but due to the small sample size can not be used to infer any significant relation .",
    "since mergers often induce star formation , we examine the relationship between clumpiness and the deviations in both v@xmath5 and m@xmath4 .",
    "however , no trend was seen at any redshift , partially due to the difficulty of measuring the clumpiness parameter .    to 100 mm     parameter calculated from the i - band images compared with the deviation in v@xmath5 from the @xmath8 relation .",
    "blue triangles denote the two high asymmetry galaxies shown in figure  6 .",
    "the solid blue line shows a best fit .",
    "the error in @xmath68 is from the combined errors in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 parameters .",
    "all other features are as outlined in figure 6.,width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]",

    "the black squares indicate the average values of all the points contained within each a - bin marked by the dotted black lines .",

    "the green and black error - bars indicate the wfpc2 and acs errors , respectively . , width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    we find in this paper that the deviations from the smtf relation in both the m@xmath4 and v@xmath5 directions correlate with galaxies with higher internal asymmetries .",
    "we have also found that disk galaxies at higher redshifts display on average higher asymmetries .",
    "the number of mergers seen in our sample , based on the asymmetry parameter , falls short by a factor of @xmath35 of the 22% of mergers found occurring in disks at @xmath71 by flores et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the postulate in conselice ( 2003 ) that in a sample of galaxies , the total number undergoing mergers would be underestimated by a factor of two when considering analysis of the asymmetry parameter alone . since flores et al ( 2006 ) used ifu measurements to look at perturbed galaxy kinematics their estimate of the number of mergers is thought to be more accurate than cas parameters allow .",
    "however , our sample is three times larger than flores et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and covers a wider range of redshifts .",
    "the derived smtf relation for our sample , at both @xmath20 and @xmath52 , are similar to each other , and are consistent with no significant evolution of the smtf relation over the redshift range @xmath15 ( conselice et al .",
    "the origin of these deviations from the smtf may arise from accreted gas , stars , and dark matter from the igm in the form of minor mergers or smooth accretion .",
    "these accretion mechanisms can increase the stellar mass with either pre - formed stars , or by inducing star formation . since mass can not be lost from a galaxy , evolution in this case must settle towards higher v@xmath5 .",
    "this settling could be caused by circularisation of gas orbits or gaseous dissipation to the disk plane , ending with the growth of a gaseous disk .",
    "deviations below the @xmath8 smtf relation are for disks with either a lower m@xmath4 and/or a higher v@xmath5 than expected .",
    "if these deviations are due to the early stages of a merger , the increased v@xmath5 may result from individual components not being resolved in the ground based spectra .",
    "this causes incorrect v@xmath5 estimations , and a falsely decreased stellar to halo mass ratio .",
    "the deviation could also be caused by a disk galaxy which has not yet formed all its stellar components and the inferred stellar to halo mass ratio could be evolving .",
    "galaxies found below the @xmath8 line therefore would need to evolve in stellar mass through accretion processes or star formation , so that this ratio would become that expected for the disk galaxy tf relation .",
    "this reasoning suggests that the majority of scenarios for deviations both above and below the @xmath8 line can be explained by the occurrence of mergers .    at @xmath62 , we find that @xmath54 70% of disks with stellar masses m@xmath72 scatter to low v@xmath5 , which shows a slight increase compared with those at @xmath61 . for m@xmath73 galaxies at @xmath62",
    "there are no systems which deviate from the @xmath8 line by more than 3 @xmath10 , likely an effect of the sampling bias .",
    "lower mass disks may have been missed at high redshift because they often are not bright enough to observe rotation curves . at lower redshift",
    "however , there are large deviations at both high and low v@xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that lower mass galaxies at low redshift may be still forming .",
    "interestingly , we do not find a significant trend between asymmetries and residuals from the smtf relation for galaxies at @xmath52 .",
    "a possible reason for this is that structural relaxation is quicker than the internal velocity relaxation after a merger .",
    "in such a case , the stellar structures are relaxed before v@xmath5 , which would be the case as the v@xmath60 values originate from larger radii where the time - scale needed for dark matter in the halo to settle are longer than the stars at the centre of the disk .",
    "figure  6 shows that there is a positive deviation in v@xmath5 from the smtf relation at higher @xmath24 .",
    "this means that highly asymmetric galaxies have large scatter at lower v@xmath5 values .",
    "this supports the idea that these deviations are due to the central stages of mergers . in this case",
    "the galaxy appears asymmetric , and has a random velocity distribution causing the lower v@xmath5 measurement .",
    "it is also apparent that deviations at higher v@xmath5 ( negative residuals ) most often have low asymmetry values .",
    "this could be explained if the galaxy is at the beginning stage of a merger where its asymmetry parameter has not yet been affected .",
    "an exception to this observation however , is one galaxy which has a large deviation at higher v@xmath5 , but a relatively high asymmetry of @xmath74 .",
    "we suggest that this galaxy fits within our hypothesis that deviations at higher v@xmath5 indicate the beginning stages of a merger .",
    "however , in this case the merging components can be visually seen , producing a high asymmetry despite the structure of the individual components remaining intact .",
    "when examining deviations from the best - fit smtf relation in m@xmath4 , we find that , in general , larger deviations of higher m@xmath4 corresponded to higher a values ( figure  9 ) .",
    "this can be explained if the galaxy has had mass accreted from the igm or a merger , disrupting its structural appearance but with v@xmath5 not yet settled .",
    "there are no positive deviations in m@xmath4 larger than @xmath75 , which is approximately 80% of the stellar mass of the milky way .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that minor mergers are the cause of the deviations .",
    "figure  9 also shows that deviations at lower m@xmath4 correspond to lower @xmath24 values .",
    "this could be explained if these galaxies have not fully evolve to their final stellar mass .",
    "we present in this paper a structural analysis of 91 disk galaxies within the redshift range @xmath65 to determine if the scatter in the stellar mass tully - fisher ( smtf ) relation at @xmath1 is produced through mergers or accretion .",
    "previous analysis of the kinematic ( v@xmath5 ) and stellar mass ( m@xmath4 ) properties of these galaxies show no significant evolution in the zero point or scatter of the smtf relation out to @xmath42 ( conselice et al .",
    "there is however a significant amount of scatter in the smtf relation whose origin is unknown .",
    "we investigate whether deviations from the stellar mass tully - fisher relation , as seen by conselice et al ( 2005a ) , can be explained by the presence of morphologically disturbed galaxies whose cas structural parameters are measured .",
    "we find that on average galaxies which deviate the most from the stellar mass tully - fisher relation are asymmetric systems .",
    "this correlation is significant at @xmath76 @xmath10 , and is not produced by star formation or edge - on galaxies .",
    "we interpret this to imply that disk galaxies at @xmath1 are forming hierarchically either through accretion of satellite galaxies , or intergalactic baryons and dark matter .",
    "this is furthermore seen through how deviations occur from the stellar mass tully - fisher relation , as @xmath77% of our disks at @xmath20 deviate above the @xmath8 relation .",
    "growth onto the stellar mass tully - fisher relation can in this case only occur through kinematic cooling to raise the value of v@xmath5 , or through the addition of matter , without significant star formation , through accretion or merging .",
    "we see a significant positive correlation between both v@xmath5 and m@xmath4 deviations with asymmetry , suggesting that both could be evolving simultaneously .",
    "our statistical analysis also suggests that more disk galaxies with @xmath57 are present at high redshift .",
    "both of these results support the hierarchical model for disk galaxy formation at @xmath1 , even after the major epoch of merging has ended and the major properties of disks are in place ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; jogee et al .",
    "2004 ; conselice et al .",
    "2005b ; ravindranath et al .",
    "2006 ) . within our galaxy sample",
    ", we furthermore find that 70% of the most asymmetric galaxies are at @xmath78 , implying strong dynamical evolution in the last 5 gyrs .",
    "this is further supported when observing the scale of deviations in stellar mass , which are typically that of a low - mass galaxy .",
    "our primary conclusion is that while disk galaxies are morphologically present in abundance at @xmath1 , these systems are still forming hierarchically during this time due to collisions with existing galaxies , or discrete baryonic / dark matter dominated clouds .",
    "there are a number of improvements which could enhance our understanding of this problem .",
    "this is necessary since both cas parameters , and the method of estimating v@xmath5 and m@xmath4 , have their limitations .",
    "few low stellar mass galaxies are present in our sample due to the original selection criteria , and the fact that more distant low mass galaxies are harder to measure rotation curves for .",
    "we therefore do not have a completely representative sample of disk galaxies over the redshift range @xmath15 .",
    "for galaxies within our sample , v@xmath5 may also have been miss - estimated due to observational errors in the ground - based slit spectroscopy .",
    "the method we use is not sufficient to imply detailed interior kinematics of a galaxy .",
    "however , combined with knowledge of their luminosity , it is sufficient to recognise those that do not have well formed disks . in conclusion , we find that positive and negative deviations from the @xmath8 tf relation seen by conselice et al ( 2005a ) are indicative of disturbed galaxies . whilst this is a step towards understanding the origin of the tf relation , detailed ifu spectra are needed to confirm this , and to determine exactly what mechanism causes this disruption .",
