    "an earthquake is a stick - slip dynamical instability of a pre - existing fault driven by the motion of a tectonic plate @xcite .",
    "while an earthquake is a complex phenomenon , certain empirical laws such as the gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law and the omori law concerning its statistical properties are known to hold .",
    "understanding the origin of such statistical properties of earthquakes is one of important issues left in earthquake studies . as a useful tool in such studies ,",
    "many researchers have used the so - called spring - block model originally proposed by burridge and knopoff ( bk ) @xcite . in this model , an earthquake fault is simulated by an assembly of blocks , each of which is connected via the elastic springs to the neighboring blocks and to the moving plate .",
    "all blocks are subject to the friction force , the source of the nonlinearity in the model , which eventually realizes an earthquake - like frictional instability .",
    "while the spring - block model is obviously a crude model to represent a real earthquake fault , its simplicity enables one to study its statistical properties with high precision .",
    "carlson , langer and others @xcite studied the statistical properties of the 1d and 2d bk models quite extensively , paying particular attention to the magnitude distribution of earthquake events .",
    "the spring - block model has also been extended in several ways , _",
    "e.g. _ , taking account of the effect of viscosity @xcite , modifying the form of the friction force @xcite , driving the system only at one end of the system @xcite , or by incorporating the rate- and state - dependent friction law @xcite .",
    "the present authors studied in the previous papers the statistical properties of the 1d and 2d bk models , focusing on their _ spatiotemporal correlations _",
    "these studies have revealed several interesting features of the 1d and 2d bk models .    meanwhile , the bk models studied in most of the previous works assumed that the inter - block interaction works only between nearest - neighboring blocks .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where a thin isolated plate is subject to the friction force and is driven by shear force @xcite .",
    "however , a real fault is not necessarily a thin isolated plate , and the elastic body extends in a direction away from the fault plane .",
    "considering the effect of such an extended elastic body adjacent to the fault plane amounts to considering the effective inter - block interaction to be _ long - ranged_. in order to make the model more realistic , it is important to take account of effect of the long - range interaction , together with the effect of the dimensionality of the fault . in this connection",
    ", we note that , in the study of thermodynamic phase transition in equilibrium , it has been wellknown that the spatial dimensionality and the range of the interaction are major elements affecting the universality class of the transition .",
    "hence , in the present paper , we study the statistical properties of the 2d bk model _ with the long - range inter - block interaction _ derived from an elastic theory , in comparison with those of the bk models with the short - range ( nearest - neighbor ) interactions studied earlier , in order to get information how the long - range nature of the interaction , expected to arise from the elastic properties of the crust adjacent to the fault plane , affects the statistical properties of earthquakes .",
    "we assume that the 3d elastic body , where the 2d bk models with the long - range interaction is supposed to lie , are isotropic , homogeneous and infinite .",
    "a fault surface is assumed to be a plane lying in this elastic body and to slip along one direction only . as a further simplification ,",
    "we adopt a static approximation for an elastic equation of motion describing the elastic body .",
    "this assumption is justified when the velocity of the seismic - wave propagation is high enough compared with the velocity of the seismic - rupture propagation .",
    "as shown in the appendix , these assumptions give rise to a spring constant between blocks decaying with their distance @xmath0 as @xmath1 .",
    "certain properties of the bk model with the long - range interaction , or the bk model extended in the direction orthogonal to the fault plane , were already studied .",
    "these include the 2d bk model extended in the direction orthogonal to the fault plane @xcite , the 2d cellular automaton version of the bk model with the long - range interaction decaying as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in particular , xia _ et al _ recently studied the 1d bk model with a variable range interaction where a block is connected to its @xmath4 neighbors with a rescaled spring constant proportional to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the type of the long - range model considered by xia _",
    "et al _ may be regarded as a mean - field type , since the model reduces to the mean - field infinite - range model in the @xmath6 limit .    in the present paper , we extend our previous studies on the spatiotemporal correlation properties of the short - range bk models @xcite , we investigate the spatiotemporal correlation properties of the 2d bk model with the long - range power - law interaction _ derived from an elastic theory _ which is expected to capture the effect of the elastic body adjacent to the fault plane .",
    "our work can also be regarded as an extension of the recent work of xia _ et al _ @xcite : first , we extend the model dimensionality from 1d to more realistic 2d .",
    "second , we consider the long - range interaction derived from an elastic theory , decaying as a power law with distance , which is different from the mean - field - type long - range interaction considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "third , we calculate various spatiotemporal correlation functions to further examine the properties of seismicity under the influence of the long - range interaction . in view of the situation that many of the previous works on the bk model were performed for the 1d model , however",
    ", we also perform for comparison a similar numerical analysis complementally for the 1d bk model with the long - range power - law interaction .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "ii , we introduce the model and explain some of the details of our numerical simulation . the results of our simulations on the 2d bk model with the long - range interactions are presented in  iii .",
    "we show the results of the event - size distribution , the mean displacement , the mean number of failed blocks and the mean stress drop at a seismic event , together with various types of spatiotemporal correlation functions of seismic events , including the local recurrence - time distribution , the seismic time - correlation function before and after the mainshock , the time development of the seismic space - correlation function before and after the mainshock , and the time development of the magnitude distribution function before the mainshock .",
    "the derivation of the long - range inter - block interaction from an elastic theory is given in appendix a. the results of our calculation on the 1d bk model with the long - range power - law interaction is also presented in the appendix b. finally , ",
    "iv is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "first , we describe the 2d bk model with the nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "the 2d bk model represents a `` fault plane '' by an assembly of blocks , which is taken to be an @xmath7 plane consisting of a 2d square array of blocks containing @xmath8 blocks in the @xmath9-direction and @xmath10 blocks in the @xmath11-direction .",
    "all blocks are assumed to move only in the @xmath9-direction along strike , and are subject to the friction force @xmath12 .",
    "each block is connected with its four nearest - neighbor blocks via the springs of the elastic constant @xmath13 , and is also connected to the moving plate via the spring of the elastic constant @xmath14 .    in the simplest case where the interaction works only between the nearest - neighbor blocks in a spatially isotropic manner , the equation of motion of the block at site @xmath15",
    "is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of a block , @xmath18 is the time , @xmath19 is the displacement along the @xmath9-direction of the block at site @xmath15 , and @xmath20 is the loading rate representing the speed of the plate .",
    "the equation is made dimensionless in the same way as in @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the time @xmath18 is measured in units of the characteristic frequency @xmath21 and the displacement @xmath19 in units of the length @xmath22 , @xmath23 being a static friction .",
    "then , the equation of motion can be written in the dimensionless form as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dimensionless time , @xmath26 is the dimensionless displacement of the block ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 is the dimensionless stiffness parameter , @xmath29 is the dimensionless loading rate , and @xmath30 is the dimensionless friction force .",
    "the nearest - neighbor model mentioned above neglects the effect of the elastic body in a direction away from the fault .",
    "as shown in appendix a , taking account of this effect amounts to taking the inter - block interaction to be long - ranged .",
    "the interaction between the two blocks at sites ( @xmath27 ) and ( @xmath31 ) is given in the dimensionless form by @xmath32 which falls off with distance @xmath0 as @xmath1 .",
    "then , the equation of motion of the 2d long - range can be written as @xmath33 if one restricts the range of interaction to nearest neighbors and takes the spatially anisotropic spring constant to be isotropic , @xmath34 , one recovers the isotropic nearest - neighbor model described by eq.(2 ) .",
    "the `` isotropy '' assumption @xmath35 is equivalent to putting the lame s constant to vanish , @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , the possible effect of such spatial anisotropy of the 2d bk model was studied within the nearest - neighbor interaction in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the property of the anisotropic model was close to the corresponding isotropic model characterized by the _",
    "mean _ spring constant @xmath37 so that the spatial anisotropy did not cause any qualitative new feature on the statistical properties of the model .",
    "thus , in the present paper , we put @xmath34 for simplicity .",
    "the investigation of the recurrence - time distribution of the anisotropic model with @xmath38 was recently made in ref.@xcite within the nearest - neighbor interaction .    in the present paper ,",
    "we also discuss in the appendix the properties of the 1d bk model with the long - range interaction , to clarify the role of the model dimensionality and to make comparison with the previous works on the various 1d bk models .",
    "we derive the 1d bk model with the long - range interaction from the corresponding 2d model by imposing the constraint that the systems is completely rigid along the @xmath11-direction corresponding to the depth direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath39 .",
    "as shown in appendix a , this yields an effective inter - block interaction decaying with distance @xmath0 as @xmath40 , @xmath41 then , the equation of motion of the 1d bk model may be given in the dimensionless form by @xmath42    as the form of the friction force @xmath43 , we use a simple velocity - weakening friction force which is a single - valued function of the velocity . as its explicit functional form",
    ", we use the form introduced by carlson and langer @xcite ,    @xmath44 ,   & \\ \\ \\ \\ { \\rm for}\\ \\   \\dot u\\leq 0 , \\\\                 \\frac{1-\\sigma}{1 + 2\\alpha \\dot u/(1-\\sigma ) } , &               \\ \\ \\ \\ { \\rm for}\\ \\   \\dot u>0 ,                \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where the friction force immediately drops to @xmath45 on sliding , and decays toward zero with a rate proportional to the parameter @xmath46 as the velocity increases .",
    "the back - slip is inhibited by imposing an infinitely large friction for @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath48 .",
    "this friction force represents the _ velocity - weakening _ friction force .",
    "although real friction force is of course more complex , not depending on the velocity alone @xcite , we use the friction force ( 7 ) for simplicity .",
    "the friction force is characterized by the two parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath46 .",
    "the former , @xmath49 , represents an instantaneous drop of the friction force at the onset of the slip , while the latter , @xmath46 , represents the rate of the friction force getting weaker on increasing the sliding velocity .",
    "the @xmath50 case represents the simplest coulomb friction law where the friction force instantaneously drops from the static value @xmath51 to its dynamical value @xmath45 as soon as the block begins to slide , and is kept constant on sliding irrespective of the velocity .",
    "the @xmath52 case also corresponds to the another coulomb friction law where the dynamical friction immediately drops to zero on sliding .",
    "in addition to these frictional parameters , the model possesses one more material parameter , an elastic parameter @xmath53 .    in the present paper",
    ", we try to cover a rather wide range of the parameter @xmath46 in the range @xmath54 $ ] , and systematically examine the @xmath46-dependence of the results .",
    "we also assume the loading rate @xmath55 to be infinitesimally small , and put @xmath56 during an earthquake event , a very good approximation for real faults @xcite .",
    "taking this limit ensures that the interval time during successive earthquake events can be measured in units of @xmath57 irrespective of particular values of @xmath55 .",
    "a seismic event begins when the accumulated stress exceeds a static friction at one of the blocks in the system . due to the effect of nonzero @xmath49 ,",
    "the block begins to move with a finite acceleration , which may ( or may not ) propagate to the neighboring blocks . the succession of such propagating motion of blocks is regarded as a seismic event .",
    "the event is terminated when all blocks in the system come to rest again .",
    "the displacement of each block at an event is measured by the displacement of that block during the beginning and the end of this event .",
    "the condition of an infinitesimal @xmath58 guarantees that no other event is triggered elsewhere in the system during the ongoing event .",
    "numerical details are the same as in @xcite .",
    "we solve the equation of motion ( 4 ) or ( 6 ) by using the runge - kutta method of the fourth order , the width of the time discretization @xmath59 being @xmath60 in most cases .",
    "the long - range interaction is summed over all blocks contained in the system .",
    "total number of @xmath61 events are generated in each run , which are used to perform various averagings .",
    "the initial position of each block @xmath62 is generated randomly according to the uniform distribution in the interval [ 0,0.02 ] , with the zero initial velocity @xmath63 . in calculating the observables , initial @xmath64 events",
    "are discarded as transients .",
    "we judge whether the system reaches a stationary state by monitoring the stability of the magnitude distribution function ( to be defined in detail below ) .    in the 2d bk model ,",
    "we follow @xcite and impose periodic boundary condition in the @xmath9-direction and free boundary condition in the @xmath11-direction , regarding the @xmath11-direction as the depth direction . for the most part of our calculation",
    ", the system size is taken to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) . in the 1d bk model studied in appendix b ,",

    "the long - range bk model is certainly a more faithful representation of an earthquake fault than the short - range bk model .",

    ", spatial seismic correlations of the long - range models tend to be suppressed compared with those of the short - range models .",
    "such a suppression of spatial seismic correlations in the long - range model might intuitively be understandable , because the long - range nature of the interaction serves to smear out the spatial variation .",
    "most interestingly , it has been found that the magnitude distribution of the 2d long - range model exhibits a `` near - critical '' power - law - like behavior close to the gutenberg - richter law , for a wide parameter range with its @xmath2-value insensitive to the model parameter , @xmath3 , in sharp contrast to the cases of the 2d short - range model and of the 1d short - range and long - range models where such a near - critical behavior is realized only by fine - tuning the model parameter to a special value .",
    "since the gr law is known to be robustly observed over different fault zones of varying locations and depths , possibly characterized by varying material parameters , the power - law feature of the magnitude distribution should be a stable attribute of earthquake occurrence , not a special property requiring a fine - tuning of the material parameter . in that sense ,",
    "stable occurrence of the near - critical magnitude distribution over a wide parameter range in the 2d long - range bk model might be of relevance to real seismicity .",
    "the observed @xmath2-value , @xmath3 ( @xmath161 ) , is not far from the one observed in real faults @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the near - critical magnitude distribution observed here is not a truly critical one , since , for sufficiently large magnitude , the magnitude distribution falls off sharply .",
    "the apparent power - law - like behavior does not extend toward larger magnitudes indefinitely .    in real seismicity",
    ", there holds an empirical law that the mean stress - drop of an earthquake is nearly constant irrespective of the event magnitude .",
    "although in the short - range bk models , the mean stress - drop increases considerably as the magnitude gets larger , in the long - range bk models the mean stress - drop hardly depends on the event magnitude in a wide parameter range .",
    "hence , the long - range bk model in the near - critical regime has an obvious advantage that it can reproduce the observed constancy of the stress - drop .",
    "large events of the long - range model usually accompany foreshocks together with a doughnut - like quiescence as their precursors , while they hardly accompany aftershocks with almost negligible seismic correlations observed after the mainshock . such absence of post - seismic activity correlated with the mainshock is more prominent in the long - range model than in the short - range model . concerning pre - seismic activity preceding the mainshock , an appreciable change of the effective @xmath2-value has occasionally been observed both in the long - range and short - range models in 2d .",
    "the @xmath2-value is either increased , decreased or unchanged in 2d , depending on the system is in the subcritical , supercritical or near - critical phase .    in this way ,",
    "the long - range 2d bk model , which is apparently the most realistic version among the types of the bk model studied so far , appear to give a reasonable description of real seismicity in its near - critical regime .",
    "the model can explain the gr - like magnitude distribution with the @xmath2-value , @xmath3 , stably realized over a rather wide parameter range , the near independency of the stress drop on the event magnitude and the absence of a characteristic peak in the recurrence - time distribution of earthquakes , _",
    "etc_. meanwhile , characteristic features become most eminent in the supercritical regime , particularly for large events .",
    "not all properties of real seismicity , however , are explained by the model .",
    "for example , the omori law frequently observed in real seismicity can not be reproduced in the bk model .",
    "this may suggest that the effects not taken account in the present model , _",
    "e.g. _ , processes like the water migration through the crack , the slow chemical process at the fault or the elastoplasticity associated with the ascenosphere , are important in realizing the aftershock obeying the omori law .    in order to make a further link between the bk model and the real world",
    ", we estimate here various time and length scales involved in the bk model . for this",
    ", we need to estimate the units of time and length of the bk model in terms of real - world earthquakes .",
    "concerning the time unit @xmath164 , we estimate it via the rise time of large earthquakes , @xmath165 , which is typically about 10 seconds .",
    "this gives an estimate of @xmath166 sec .",
    "concerning the length unit @xmath167 , we estimate it making use of the fact that the typical displacement in large events of our simulation is of order one @xmath167 unit , which in real - world large earthquakes is typically 5 meters . then",
    ", we get @xmath168 meters .",
    "since the loading rate @xmath169 associated with the real plate motion is typically 5 cm / year , the dimensionless loading rate @xmath170 is estimated to be @xmath171 .    in our simulation of the bk model , the doughnut - like quiescence",
    "was observed before the mainshock at the time scale of , say , @xmath172 .",
    "this time scale corresponds to about 1 - 10 years . in our simulation",
    ", the doughnut - like quiescence was observed in the region only within a few blocks from the epicenter of the mainshock . to give the corresponding real - world estimate",
    ", we need the real - world estimate of our block size @xmath173 . in the bk model ,",
    "the length scale @xmath173 is entirely independent of the length scale @xmath167 , and has to be determined independently .",
    "we estimate @xmath173 via the typical velocity of the rupture propagation , @xmath174 , which is about 3 km / sec in real earthquakes . from this relation , we get @xmath175 km . the length scale associated with the doughnut - like quiescence is then estimated to be 3 @xmath176 6 km in radius .    throughout our present simulations ,",
    "we have assumed the velocity - weakening friction force . the extent of the velocity weakening is mainly described by the parameter @xmath46 , which has a dimension of the inverse velocity .",
    "the unit of @xmath177 is then estimated to be @xmath178 m / sec .",
    "the recent high - velocity friction measurements indicate that the friction coefficient of serpentinite drops significantly at the slip velocity of order @xmath179 m / sec @xcite .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the @xmath46-value of order @xmath180 , which is indeed the values of interest here .",
    "the seismic moment @xmath69 is approximately given by , @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the shear modulus , @xmath183 is the displacement and @xmath184 is the rupture - zone size .",
    "the shear modulus @xmath182 of the crust is typically about 30 gpa .",
    "the moment magnitude @xmath17 measured in the mks unit is defined by , @xmath185 from eq.(7.1 ) and ( 7.2 ) , we can obtain the relation between the moment magnitude @xmath17 in real world and the magnitude @xmath58 in the bk model as , @xmath186 in the bk model , an upper cut - off magnitude @xmath187 of the gr - like behavior is found to be about @xmath188 , which corresponds to @xmath189 in real world .",
    "although it is tempting to speculate that the `` interrupted power - law '' or `` near - criticality '' observed in our model simulation might somehow be related to real observation , it is not known whether there really exists an upper cut - off magnitude in real seismicity .    in the long - range bk model ,",
    "the mean stress - drop hardly depends on the event magnitude in the near - critical regime . in the 2d long - range bk model in the near - critical regime , the mean stress - drop was estimated to be @xmath190 .",
    "this corresponds in the real world the mean stress drop of @xmath191 80 mpa .",
    "since the mean stress - drop is @xmath192 mpa in real seismicity , the estimated value of the mean stress - drop is a bit larger than but roughly consistent with the real value .",
    "the present study was performed under many assumptions , _",
    "e.g. _ , an earthquake fault is completely flat , material parameters are homogeneous , there is no depth dependence in the material parameters , a friction force depends on the velocity alone , _ etc . _ as one of such assumptions , we have employed a static approximation in our simulation of the long - range bk model , _",
    "i.e. _ , we have assumed that the velocity of the seismic - wave propagation is sufficiently larger than the rupture velocity .",
    "in real earthquakes , however , the rupture velocity is comparable to the shear - wave velocity .",
    "thus , it is clearly desirable to perform simulations based on a fully dynamical elastic theory .    in spite of such limitations of the model",
    ", our present study has revealed that the 2d long - range bk model can reproduce several important aspects of real seismicity .",

    "we have checked that this qualitative difference is not due to the different choice of the @xmath53-value in the two calculations .",

    "one case of interest in the 1d model might be the @xmath258 near - critical case located at the phase boundary between the small-@xmath46 subcritical regime and the supercritical regime , since such a region is absent in the corresponding 2d model due to the discontinuous nature of the transition .",
