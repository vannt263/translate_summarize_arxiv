    "there is a region in parameter space where the dama signal is not ruled out by other experiments , see fig.[edm - plot ] .    for smaller masses , @xmath86 gev",
    ", the figure shows that cogent rules out dama . in appendix c",
    "we review the scalar interaction mediated scattering ( see fig.[sigma ] ) where we see that dama is allowed by cogent for any dm mass below about 15 gev .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the dm interaction via electric dipole moment has a factor of recoil energy ( @xmath14 in the denominator of its cross section in eqn.([dr ] ) .",
    "this means that for low threshold this cross section is large and in the case of cogent this threshold happens to be smaller than that for dama .",
    "but as the dm mass increases this advantage in favour of cogent is nullified by the dm mass factor which again appears in the denominator of the cross section formulae .",
    "the limit on direct magnetic dipole moment is @xmath87 if the dm mass @xmath88 gev , see fig.[mu ] . in this mass range",
    "there is no allowed parameter space which is consistent with a positive signal from dama with null results of other experiments . for dm masses",
    "@xmath89 gev and @xmath90 there is a region in parameter space where the dama signal is not ruled out by other experiments , see fig.[mu ] .",
    "actually , in the low dm mass range the collider bound @xcite is more restrictive than the direct wimp search limits , as can be see in fig.[mu ] .",
    "if the only interaction of dm with standard model particles had been via electromagnetic dipole interaction then the relic density of the dm particles would be determined uniquely from the annihilation cross section of the em - dipole mediated process @xmath91 and @xmath17 .",
    "such a calculation shows @xcite that to get relic cold dm density consistent with wmap measurement the dipole moments have to be in the range of @xmath92 e - cm or @xmath93 when @xmath94 gev . the limits on dm dipole moments that we obtain on the basis of nuclear scattering experiments are much lower .",
    "this means that the dm particles must have some other more dominant interaction which decouples at a temperature @xmath95 to give the correct relic abundance while the dipole interactions decouple much earlier and have no bearing on the present dm density .",
    "these other dominant interactions however must not dominate over dipole interactions in nuclear scattering in order for our bounds on dipole moments to be meaningful .",
    "a good example of such a situation is seen in certain classes of wimp models @xcite , where the interaction with standard model particles can be by higgs exchange which gives rise to spin - independent ( si ) interactions with nucleons or by @xmath16 exchange which gives rise to spin - dependent ( sd ) interactions @xcite .",
    "when the nuclear scattering is by sd interaction then there is no coherent enhancement of the cross section by the atomic number .",
    "the bounds on the cross section for si interactions is therefore more stringent than the bounds on sd interactions .",
    "the bounds for si interactions from nuclear scattering experiments is @xmath96 cm@xmath2 and for sd interactions it is @xmath98 cm@xmath2 ( for @xmath99 gev ) .",
    "our bounds are relevant for wimps which can have a large spin - dependent cross section @xmath100 cm@xmath2 to give the correct relic density , but this cross section is too small to be observed in nuclear scattering experiments .      in figs.[edm - inel ] and [ mu - inel ] we plot the constraints on the transition dipole moments @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , versus the dm mass @xmath17 .",
    "we have fixed three values for the mass @xmath103 and 100 gev , in order to illustrate our findings .    we see that a common feature of the plots is that the region where dama is consistent with other experiments is quite large and extends to higher and higher inelasticities .",
    "however for @xmath104 gev the region is further constrained by the collider bound from l3 , and the allowed region is reduced .",
    "the allowed area is more and more reduced as we lower @xmath17 and for @xmath105 gev there is no region at all .",
    "for @xmath106 gev there is no collider bound and the region is large .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the experimentally allowed parameter space for transition dipole moments is that the cosmologically preferred value ( for getting the correct relic abundance ) @xmath107 e - cm or @xmath108 @xcite is consistent with the allowed values dama and other experiments when @xmath109 gev and the mass split @xmath110 kev .",
    "thus , we find that transition dipole scattering has a large parameter space where the results of dama , the null results from other experiments and cosmological relic abundance are all consistent .",
    "the event rates depend upon @xmath111 and @xmath79 or @xmath6 as @xmath112 or @xmath113 respectively .",
    "the dipole moments can increase by four orders of magnitude from the @xmath114 e - cm to @xmath115 e - cm ( and similarly for the case of magnetic moments ) and the same event rates would be obtained if mass is increased by eight orders of magnitude from @xmath116 gev to @xmath117 gev .",
    "the range of dm mass for which dama is consistent with cosmology and l3 is therefore quite large , @xmath118 .",
    "this parameter space of @xmath17 and electric /magnetic moments can give rise to a missing energy signal via the process @xmath119hadronic jets , and the dipolar model of dark matter may be testable at the lhc .",
