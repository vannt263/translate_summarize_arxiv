    "an surprising property of equilibrium states is that they can be identified by a small number of extensive variables ( evs ) even though the system has an almost infinite number of degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .",
    "when ev values are given , the equilibrium system almost surely exhibits the most typical state , i.e. , the equilibrium state is uniquely determined by macroscopic observation .",
    "this is the basis of the equilibrium statistical mechanics as the law of large numbers and an equal probability for microscopic states . on the other hand ,",
    "nonequilibrium states generally need more information to be identified , and a history dependence ( non - markov process ) appears if we label the state in a manner similar to that used to label the equilibrium states @xcite . to treat the dynamics of a system as a markov process",
    ", one has to deal with more dofs , equal to the total number of the system in the worst case .",
    "however , it is natural to expect that there will be many situations in which a small extension of the dofs will provide a sufficiently accurate description of nonequilibrium phenomena . in this paper , we propose a method to describe the non - stationary nonequilibrium dynamics by employing a few more evs that are redundant for equilibrium states .",
    "we start from a macroscopic description with a small number of dofs and approach the microscopic description by increasing degrees .",
    "this approach proceeds in the manner opposite to the usual approach , which start from microscopic description and reduces the dofs although approaching the same point .",
    "thus , this approach may be a new method to connect the microscopic and macroscopic worlds and add a new perspective to nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "if out - of - equilibrium dynamics can be described by the information of equilibrium states , like the successful linear response theory  @xcite , it can be very useful for our understanding . in the vicinity of the equilibrium",
    ", we have the phenomenological theory stating that the thermodynamic force that restores the system to an equilibrium is proportional to the free energy gradient , which is a function of evs  @xcite . a quadratic well of the free energy",
    "is often assumed , which leads to a linear response to the deviation from its lowest point , i.e. , the equilibrium point .",
    "this theory is useful for a weak nonequilibrium , but can not be applied for a strong nonequilibrium .",
    "the projection operator method @xcite is typically used to extract the dynamics of slow - changing variables , i.e. , integrating out the rapidly changing variables . in the formalism by mori @xcite",
    ", the projection leads to a generalized langevin equation as an equation of motion for the remaining variables .",
    "the reduction of the number of dofs can be seen as a local equilibrium approach .",
    "we take a similar approach ; specifically , we develop a method to describe stochastic dynamics .",
    "consider the case of the relaxation dynamics far from equilibrium , where intensive variables such as temperature are controlled .",
    "it is difficult to relate a general transient state to the equilibrium state that corresponds to the external condition .",
    "however , a transient state labeled by a set of evs , such as internal energy , can be related to another equilibrium state having the same energy .",
    "it is a microcanonical ensemble that is equivalent to the canonical ensemble at a temperature different from that of the environment .",
    "as mentioned before , nonequilibrium states need a higher number of evs than equilibrium states . here",
    "we call such states `` extended equilibrium states '' . the equivalence of the transient state to the extended equilibrium state means that an equal probability holds for the nonequilibrium state .",
    "it is worth considering the possibility of describing nonequilibrium dynamics by using only information from the extended equilibrium state .",
    "if such description is possible , it will be a useful clue for understanding nonequilibrium phenomena based on the well - understood equilibrium property .",

    "this is the reason for the drastic improvement in accuracy from the one - variable description .",
    "while the contour line @xmath161 is related to the equilibrium line in the fixed-@xmath64 ensemble for @xmath146 , @xmath167 is related to the equilibrium line for the fixed-@xmath60 ensemble for a given @xmath168 .",
    "the latter gives a trajectory of the quasi - equilibrium dynamics when the relaxation of the magnetization is much slower than that of the energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : trajectory](b ) shows the contour lines of @xmath63 .",
    "the contour lines are similar to the trajectory of the isothermal relaxation obtained by the kmc method although the agreement is slightly less than that of the master equation results [ fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory](a ) ] far from equilibrium .",
    "the quasi - equilibrium dynamics can not reproduce the rapid change in @xmath60 , but that has an almost negligible effect in the present case .",
    "this is a useful approximation for the trajectory ; note , however , that the contour lines of the temperature provide no information on the time evolution .",
    "in this paper , we propose a method to analyze the non - stationary nonequilibrium state by using a master equation for extensive ( macroscopic ) variables and show some applications of the method .",
    "the method uses the quantity @xmath169 calculated by equilibrium ensemble for fixed evs , which means an equal probability is assumed for microscopic states in nonequilibrium .    for the all - to - all coupling model",
    ", the state can be identified accurately only by the single variable @xmath60 since the system lacks a spatial structure .",
    "thus , there is no difference between equilibrium and nonequilibrium states in this case , and the one - variable description gives rigorous dynamics .",
    "for the two - dimensional 3-state potts model , while the one - variable description is far from adequate to resemble the true dynamics , the two - variable description is sufficient .",
    "this improvement can be attributed to the fact that we have a unique trajectory for any external conditions @xmath63 in the one - dimensional @xmath41-space corresponding to @xmath64 ; this trajectory is equivalent to the equilibrium line in two dimensions ( this is the reason why strange inflection points , which corresponds to the singularity at @xmath120 , are observed for off - critical temperatures as in fig .  [",
    "fig:1d_v - e](a ) . )",
    "it has been suggested that transient states in finite - dimensional systems have distinctly different kinds of spatial fluctuations depending on temperature even for the same internal energy .",
    "specifically , the trajectory runs in the region where @xmath170 . for the same @xmath64 , @xmath60 on the trajectory is larger for higher temperatures .",
    "this is because the minority spins with number @xmath171 have a lesser tendency to aggregate at higher temperatures and thus acquire @xmath64 with smaller @xmath172 from the surface energy .    to investigate equilibrium critical properties from nonequilibrium relaxation at the critical point",
    ", the so - called nonequilibrium relaxation analysis @xcite can be used . in the relaxation ,",
    "a nonequilibrium correlation length grows with time in a power law , which is similar to the growth of the equilibrium correlation length when approaching the critical point by tuning an external parameter .",
    "the critical exponents are estimated using this similarity @xcite .",
    "the two paths on which the growth of the nonequilibrium and equilibrium correlation length are observed correspond to the trajectory of @xmath120 and the equilibrium line @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "both paths approach the critical point @xmath174 , where @xmath175 , and the paths are expressed as @xmath176 .",
    "however , the proportionality constant @xmath177 is different between the two , which makes the two paths macroscopically distinguishable . interestingly , while the relaxation dynamics along them are different , the critical exponents , such as @xmath135 and @xmath63 , are the same",
    ".    for the two - dimensional 3-state potts model , the second variable , the order parameter , has special importance because its relaxation is much slower than that of the energy .",
    "thus , it has more impact on the total dynamics .",
    "therefore , the quasi - equilibrium dynamics with respect to the order parameter is a good approximation .",
    "indeed , the contour line of the temperature , i.e. , the array of equilibrium points for various temperatures , gives a good analog of the relaxation trajectory it does not provide information on the time evolution .",
    "one would think that the one - variable description with @xmath60 would give good results comparable to those of the two - variable description with @xmath64 and @xmath60 .",
    "however , in our formulation , the ev conjugate to the non - zero intensive variable must be employed to determine @xmath26 .",
    "it is possible to improve the accuracy of our method by employing more dofs ; however , the difficulty is to find appropriate variables independent of each other .",
    "important criteria are the slowness of the relaxation and the capture of the spatial structure .",
    "one good candidate would be the structure factor , @xmath178 .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 is equivalent to @xmath179 . by adding @xmath180 from small @xmath181 to larger ones , a finer structure of the space",
    "would be included stepwise .",
    "however , in practice , the addition of dofs is very difficult in the implementation adopted here because the dimensionality of the @xmath41-space increases .",
    "depending on the problem , we might not need information of the wide range of the @xmath41-space .",
    "in addition , the calculation of @xmath33 is suitable for trivial parallel computation .",
    "one relaxation dynamics of a given intensive variable can be generated with a reasonably lower computational cost by kmc method than by the present method .",
    "our method takes significant computational time to estimate @xmath31 .",
    "once this is obtained , however , one can easily generate time evolutions for various @xmath7 .",
    "this is similar to the efficient calculation method of equilibrium expectation values by using the reweighting method with extended ensembles @xcite .",
    "this aspect is very useful when calculating the fluctuation of quantities , which requires many samples .",
    "however , our main aim is not to develop an efficient way to yield time evolution but to find a way to understand the system far from equilibrium in the framework of equilibrium statistics .",
    "the basic concept proposed here is not only for numerical analysis but for analytical treatment .",
    "it is possible to develop an approach to nonequilibrium dynamics by utilizing the attained knowledge of equilibrium physics .",
    "the success in the present demonstration encourages us to continue in this direction .",
    "we have found that the present method works well for critical relaxation dynamics .",
    "the next interesting application is the dynamics taking first - order transitions @xcite , such as liquid - vapor transition and protein folding @xcite .",
    "it is often explained that the nucleation dynamics is governed by the free - energy barrier determined by the competition between bulk and surface free energies .",
    "however , for a finite - dimensional system with short - range interaction , this picture is not applicable to the macroscopic free energy , which is a convex function of evs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the addition of dofs is essential for nucleation dynamics .    the basic idea of the present method can be applied to a non - stationary state of an open system with certain driving forces ; a non - stationary state is described by a nonequilibrium stationary state . by replacing the word `` equilibrium '' with `` stationary '' ,",
