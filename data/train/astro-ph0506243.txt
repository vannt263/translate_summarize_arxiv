    "multi - frequency very long baseline polarimetry ( vlbp ) observations are crucial for determining the magnetic field structure and the distribution of faraday rotating material in the innermost few parsecs of the cores of active galaxies and quasars .    the first successful vlbp observations at 86  ghz were reported by @xcite , who presented polarized images of the well - known quasars 3c273 ansd 3c279 . here",
    "we report concurrent 43  ghz ( @xmath6 mm ) and 86  ghz ( @xmath7 mm ) vlbp of the 3c273 that allow us to investigate the distribution of faraday rotating material near the core of this object , probing linear scales as small as a few light years  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are assumed in all calculations . ] .",
    "3c273 ( j1229 + 0203 ) is a good source on which to attempt 86  ghz vlbp , as it is one of the brightest quasars in the sky at that frequency .",
    "also , its low redshift of @xmath11 gives very high linear resolution ( 2.73  pc / mas ) at the source .",
    "it is also a well studied superluminal source .",
    "for instance , homan et al ( 2001 ) measured the proper motions of five jet components over six epochs in 1996 at both 15 and 22  ghz .",
    "results ranged from 0.77 to 1.15  mas  yr@xmath8 , corresponding to superluminal motions of @xmath12 .",
    "concurrent 43 and 86  ghz observations of 3c273 were performed on 9 may 2002 ( epoch 2002.35 ) using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) over 10.5  hours .",
    "the vlba was equipped with all ten 43  ghz receivers and seven 86  ghz receivers ( fort davis , kitt peak , los alamos , mauna kea , north liberty , owens valley , pie town ) , effectively yielding the same resolution at each frequency . with a clean beam of about @xmath13 mas ,",
    "the linear resolution at the source is about @xmath14 light years .",
    "the data were recorded with a total bandwidth of 64  mhz , and were correlated at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) in socorro , nm . approximately @xmath15 hours total integration was spent on 3c273 at 43  ghz , and @xmath16 hours at 86  ghz .",
    "these integration times lead to theoretical rms noise values of @xmath170.5  mjy beam@xmath8 at 43  ghz , and @xmath172  mjy beam@xmath8 at 86  ghz .",
    "the observations of 3c273 were interleaved with those of the quasar 3c279 , which was a second target source and served to confirm our calibration .",
    "results for 3c279 will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "the nrao aips and caltech difmap packages were used for calibration and hybrid imaging .",
    "details about vlbp calibration and imaging may be found in @xcite and roberts , wardle , & brown ( 1994 ) .",
    "methods to account for the complexities of 86  ghz calibration not present in lower frequency data , and to check the validity of the 86  ghz solutions are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the calibration of the instrumental polarization ( d - terms ) was performed for 3c273 and 3c279 separately , and results were compared . at 43  ghz ,",
    "the typical d - term values were found to be @xmath18 , and at 86  ghz they were @xmath19 .",
    ". _ difference _ between the d terms determined using 3c273 and those determined using 3c279 was @xmath20 at 86  ghz .",
    "this is a measure of the errors in the determination of the d terms . following the prescription in appendix 1 of roberts et al ( 1994 )",
    ", we estimate that the corresponding error in fractional polarization in the images is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observed fractional polarization of the core component of 3c273 , which is @xmath23 .",
    "naturally weighted images of 3c273 in total intensity , polarized intensity , and fractional linear polarization at 43  ghz and 86  ghz are shown in figure  1 .",
    "tick marks represent the orientation of the electric vectors of the polarized radiation .",
    "the orientations of the evpas at 43  ghz were derived using data from the `` vla / vlba polarization calibration page '' @xcite , in which 3c273 was observed only one day prior to our own observations .",
    "currently , there is no source to use as a calibrator to set the zero - point of the evpas at 86  ghz .",
    "we therefore arbitrarily chose to rotate tick marks in the 86  ghz @xmath24 image so that the evpa of component 7 is the same at 43 and 86  ghz . to see the evpas more easily ,",
    "figure  2 shows a zoom of the polarized emission from the core region at each frequency .",
    "model fits to the u - v data are presented in table  1 ; component labels for 86  ghz were matched to corresponding 43  ghz components for ease of comparison .",
    "the 43  ghz total intensity image has a snr of 2400 , and a peak to lowest contour dynamic range of @xmath17300:1 .",
    "the 86  ghz @xmath25 image presented in figure  2@xmath26 has a snr of 590 , and a peak to lowest contour dynamic range of @xmath1775:1 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the @xmath24 images are about @xmath27 times smaller .",

    "the core is component d and the jet stretches to the south - west ( and continues for another 20,000 mas in all wavebands ) . at this resolution ,",
    "the jet is quickly resolved . at 86  ghz ,",
    "the resolution is similar ( because of the smaller array ) but the lower sensitivity means that essentially only the first milliarcsecond of the jet can be seen .",
    "the component we label q1/w1 is the same as component u4/k4 in ojha et al ( 2004 ) , who measured a proper motion of @xmath106c .",
    "notice that the inner jet no longer points directly towards this component .",
    "this is because the direction of the inner jet varies on fairly short timescales over a range of structural position angles ( spas ) between at least @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( e.g. krichbaum et al . 1990 ) .",
    "abraham & romero ( 1999 ) proposed that the variation in orientation of the inner jet was periodic with a period of about 20 years , and they fitted a precessing jet model to the extant vlbi observations .",
    "it is now clear ( ojha et al 2003 ; chen et al 2005 ) that the jet orientation varies on a timescale of months rather than decades , and is not periodic .",
    "the bright inner jet components in figure 1 , components 6 and 7 , are almost equidistant from the core at @xmath109 mas , but at distinctly different structural position angles ( spas ) . the northern component ( 6 )",
    "is somewhat better aligned with the downstream jet components , and has a spa of @xmath110 . the southern component ( 7 )",
    "is stronger , has a flatter spectrum , and a spa of @xmath111 .",
    "it is interesting that both are present simultaneously .",
    "we are not aware of earlier images that show such a morphology , and we conjecture that we have caught 3c273 `` in the act '' of changing its jet direction . if this is so , component 7 , because of its location and spectrum , is presumably the younger component , and is defining a new jet direction . since it has already drawn level with component 6 , we expect component 7 to be moving faster .",
    "proper motion measurements will easily support or refute these conjectures .",
    "the polarized images shown in figures  1 and 2 show that the inner jet is strongly polarized .",
    "components q6/w6 and q7/w7 both exhibit fractional polarizations near @xmath112 at both frequencies .",
    "two years earlier , attridge ( 2001 ) found a component at a similar location , whose fractional polarization was @xmath113 at 86  ghz .",
    "by contrast , linear polarization is not detected in the core ( component @xmath114 ) at either frequency .",
    "the limits are @xmath115 at 43  ghz , and @xmath116 at 86  ghz .",
    "this also agrees with attridge s ( 2001 ) observations .    at lower frequencies ,",
    "3c273 also displays moderate linear polarization in the jet , and little or no polarization in the core .",
    "these are properties common to many agn ( e.g.  taylor 1998 ; lister & smith 2000 ; pollack et al .",
    "2003 ; ojha et al .",
    "although we are unable to determine the zero point for the evpas at 86 ghz , figure  3 shows clearly that there is a large _ difference _ in faraday rotation between jet components 6 and 7 . at 43  ghz",
    "the difference in evpas is @xmath117 . at 86 ghz",
    "the difference in evpas is @xmath118 .",
    "the difference between these numbers is @xmath119 radians , and this is independent of the zero point at 86  ghz .",
    "there is therefore an absolute _ difference _ in rotation measure between components 6 and 7 of @xmath120  rad m@xmath3 . in the source frame",
    "we multiply by @xmath121 , which gives @xmath122  rad m@xmath3 .",
    "the smallest possible rotation measures consistent with these data are @xmath123  rad m@xmath3 for component 7 and @xmath124  rad m@xmath3 for component 6 .",
    "these are among the largest rotation measures ever observed .",
    "one or both of them are actually _ lower _ limits , because we have only determined their difference . the distance between components 6 and 7 is 0.3 mas . if we express the rotation measure difference as an angular gradient , then it is @xmath125  rad m@xmath3 mas@xmath8 .",
    "both asada et al ( 2002 ) and recently zavala & taylor ( 2005 ) have also measured differences in rotation measure across the jet of 3c273 at the same location , about 7 mas from the core , but at different epochs ( 1995.9 and two epochs in 2000 respectively ) .",
    "asada et al found a gradient of about @xmath51  rad m@xmath3 mas@xmath8 .",
    "zavala & taylor find a gradient of @xmath126  rad m@xmath3 mas@xmath8 , and suggest that asada et al measured a smaller value because of lower resolution ( their observations were made at 5 and 8  ghz ) .",
    "the transverse gradient at 7 mas from the core has the same sign as we find at 0.9 mas ( more positive rotation measure on the north side of the jet ) , but it is smaller by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "( we would require simultaneous observations to make the previous statement more precise . )",
    "it is interesting to compare the rotation measures found in the middle of each slice where the signal to noise ratio is highest and the effect of a gradient is negligible ( so long as there is little depolarization ) .",
    "asada et al measure about @xmath127  rad m@xmath3 at the center of their slice in 1995 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations at 15 and 22  ghz throughout the following year reported by ojha et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "zavala and taylor measure about @xmath128  rad m@xmath3 at the same location some 4 years later .",
    "we suggest that all these measurements are in fact correct , and that the rotation measure distribution varies in time",
    ". this would also be consistent with the results of deep multiwavelength observations made by t. chen ( private communication ) , and with observations of the core region ( see next section ) .",
    "the faraday rotation we observe must be external to components 6 and 7 .",
    "internal faraday rotation will inevitably depolarize the source ( sometimes called `` front - back '' depolarization ) and there is no sign of this ( see table  1 ) . in general the fractional polarization drops by a factor of two",
    "when the observed rotation reaches @xmath129 ( burn , 1966 ) . here , the least depolarization would be observed if the rotation measures of components 6 and 7 were @xmath130  rad m@xmath3 .",
    "even then , the predicted fractional polarizations at 43  ghz would be only @xmath131 , whereas the observed values are close to @xmath112 .",
    "this rules out internal faraday rotation by material that fills the jet , but faraday rotation in a sheath or boundary layer is still a possibility .",
    "inoue et al . ( 2003 ) reached the same conclusion for the gradient observed by asada et al . , and",
    "the same argument can be applied to taylor & zavala s observations .",
    "no linear polarization is detected from the core component d in these observations .",
    "the limits are @xmath115 at 43  ghz , and @xmath116 at 86  ghz .",
    "the high rotation measures observed less than 1 milliarcsecond downstream from component d suggest that it is depolarized by differential faraday rotation .",
    "this could be internal to the jet , but we favor an external screen because it is a natural extension of the screen that causes the faraday rotation in front of components 6 and 7 .",
    "if the intrinsic polarization of component d is @xmath132 , and the variance in rotation measure along different lines of sight to component d is @xmath133 , the observed polarization is given by @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "we do not know the value of @xmath132 , but a plausible range is from @xmath135 to @xmath136 , since this is the range of polarizations observed by nartallo et al ( 1998 ) at 270 ghz using the jcmt .",
    "the corresponding minimum values for @xmath137 are @xmath138 rad m@xmath3 .",
    "( the first value is derived from the 43 ghz measurement . )",
    "we can not be certain that the 270 ghz measurements by nartallo et al ( 1998 ) actually refer to our component d. but if they do , we can derive an upper limit on @xmath137 from the requirement that the core is significantly polarized at 270  ghz : @xmath139 rad m@xmath3 .",
    "note that this dispersion requires that the scale length for rotation measure fluctuations is smaller than component d itself .",
    "farther out , at 0.9 mas , the fluctuation scale length is larger than the size of components 6 and 7 ( or they would show depolarization at 43  ghz ) but smaller than the distance between them . similarly , at 7 mas the fluctuation scale length is larger than the restoring beam but smaller than the width of the jet .",
    "zavala and taylor ( 2001 ) have also observed large and spatially resolved faraday rotation in the core region of 3c273 , which they found to be time - variable . at epoch 2000.07 , they found a rotation measure of @xmath140  rad m@xmath3 in the north - east end of this region , near our component d , and @xmath141  rad m@xmath3 in the south - east end , near the location of our components 6 and 7 .",
    "their measurements ( which were at 15 and 43  ghz ) do not match ours in any obvious way , probably attesting to the variability of this source .",
    "we note that if 3c273 were at a more typical redshift of , say , @xmath142 , then components 6 and 7 would appear blended with the core , and could not be separated by current vlbi arrays .",
    "then the apparent `` core '' would be polarized , and it would be very difficult to measure rotation measures as large as those reported here . thus 3c273 may not be unusual in these properties ; it is merely closer .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate the value of polarization sensitive vlbi at 86  ghz . in particular , it allows us to probe the jet and its environment even closer to the central engine , and on the smallest available linear scales .",
    "it can also reveal very high rotation measures that can not be seen at longer wavelengths because of source or bandwidth depolarization .    at 86  ghz ,",
    "3c273 reveals two strongly polarized ( @xmath143 ) components within a milliarcsecond of the core that have rotation measures that differ by @xmath122  rad m@xmath3 .",
    "this gradient is transverse to the jet direction and it has the same sign but is 2 - 3 three orders of magnitude larger than the gradients found by asada et al ( 2000 ) and by zavala & taylor ( 2005 ) at greater distances from the core . extrapolating such a gradient to the core component readily accounts for its persistent lack of polarization even at 86 ghz .",
    "the lack of depolarization in the jet requires that the faraday rotation occurs in a region external to the visble jet itself , but presumably close to it .",
    "the data suggest that this faraday rotating region is variable in time as well as spatially , and may be a boundary layer that represents the interaction of the jet with its environment .",
    "rotation measure observations at the highest frequencies therefore offer a new way of exploring this environment .",
    "we thank tingdong chen for communicating the results of his observations .",
