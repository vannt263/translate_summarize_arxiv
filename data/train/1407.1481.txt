    "a new bosonic resonance of mass about 125 gev has recently been discovered by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at cern .",
    "even though the current analyses show that this new resonance exhibits properties very similar to the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , there is no doubt that the sm is not the final description of nature due to its drawbacks such as gauge hierarchy problem @xcite and absolute stability of of the sm higgs potential @xcite",
    ". the 125 gev higgs boson can give hints of new physics beyond the sm , and here supersymmetry ( susy ) stands out as one of the forefront candidates .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) can resolve the gauge hierarchy problem by invoking superpartners of the sm fields . also , the lightest cp - even higgs boson , one of the five physical higgs states of the mssm , exhibits very similar properties as the sm s higgs boson in the decoupling limit @xcite . in addition , imposing r - parity conservation",
    "the mssm gives a highly plausible candidate for the dark matter in the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "nevertheless , the lhc , as hadron smasher experiments , has brought very severe bounds on the color sector . since there is no significant deviation in the higgs production and decay properties with respect to the sm , and no significant signal of the supersymmetric particles ,",
    "results from atlas and cms have lifted the lower bounds on masses of gluinos and squarks in the first two generations up to @xmath4 tev @xcite .",
    "when squarks of the first two generations are heavy and decoupled , the bound on gluino mass is lowered depending on its decay channels .",
    "for instance , through gluino - mediated pair production of the third generation squarks , gluinos of mass up to @xmath5 tev are excluded depending on the final states @xcite . even though atlas and cms results",
    "are presently not much severe for the third generation squarks , stop masses in the range of @xmath6 gev have been excluded for massless lsp @xcite ( bounds on the stop mass are relaxed for massive lsp ) .",
    "the stop decay channels @xmath7 and @xmath8 exclude stop masses up to 650 gev @xcite .",
    "moreover , atlas collaboration has recently looked for nlsp stop via its decay mode to charm quark and lsp , and the results have excluded stop masses up to 230 gev @xcite .",
    "this channel also puts a lower bound on gluino mass as @xmath9 tev @xcite .",
    "these exclusion model - specific limits express non - observation of light stops and gluinos at the lhc .",
    "the exclusion is not entire .",
    "the reason is that a small region with @xmath10 gev in @xmath11 plane has not been excluded yet .",
    "indeed , discrimination of @xmath12 and @xmath13 events with identical final states in this region is challenging @xcite and @xmath13 cross section stays in the error bar in calculation of top pair production @xcite which is measured to be @xcite @xmath14    as is well - known for a long time , the higgs boson mass is bounded from above by @xmath15 at tree - level in the mssm , and hence , one definitely needs to utilize radiative corrections in order to have 125 gev higgs boson mass .",
    "since the yukawa couplings for the first two families are negligible , the third family stands out as the dominant source inducing such sizeable quantum contributions to higgs boson mass .",
    "the sbottom contribution is proportional to sbottom mixing parameter and @xmath16 .",
    "however , strong bounds from vacuum stability on the @xmath17 term allows only a minor contribution from the sbottom sector @xcite .",
    "thus , the 125 gev higgs boson largely constrains the stop sector . in the case of @xmath18 ,",
    "the left- and right - handed stop masses are excluded up to @xmath19 gev . if one sets a hierarchy between the two stops ( @xmath20 or vice versa ) , then it becomes possible to have a light stop , while the other must weigh above @xmath21 tev for moderate @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this hierarchy necessitates a large stop mixing .",
    "since mssm has many scalar fields , one may be concerned about color and/or charge breaking ( ccb ) minima that could occur in case of large mixings at which some scalar fields may develop non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "even though large @xmath23 can ensure absence of such minima @xcite , specifically the sfermions of the third family need a careful treatment , since their vevs may cause tunneling into a deeper ccb minimum @xcite . among the mssm scalars ,",
    "stop has a special importance , since its non - zero vev breaks @xmath24 and @xmath25 both .",
    "we thus check the vacuum stability for the cmssm benchmark points listed in the text . apart from semi - analytic estimates ,",
    "the public code vevacious @xcite returns stable vacua for certain parameter regions accommodating light stops .",
    "the stability of the cmssm points encourages us to conclude stability of more relaxed , less constrained susy models .",
    "returning to the large mixing , a 125 gev higgs boson in the mssm necessitates large splitting between the two stops , and this obviously contradicts with the naturalness domain @xmath26 gev @xcite unless some extensions of mssm are considered @xcite . from the naturalness point of view ,",
    "one thus concludes that light stop regions in the mssm need significant fine - tuning to yield the electroweak scale ( @xmath27 gev ) correctly . in order to analyze the amount of fine - tuning in allowed parameter regions , one can specifically focus on the z - boson mass ( @xmath28 gev ) @xmath29 which follows from the minimization of the mssm higgs potential @xcite such that @xmath30 is the higgsino dirac mass , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are radiative effects from the higgs potential , and @xmath34 are the soft - masses of the higgs doublets @xmath35 which give mass to u - type and d - type fermions .    for quantifying the amount of fine - tuning associated to @xmath36 , we utilize the measure defined in the recent work @xcite .",
    "namely , we introduce the electroweak fine - tuning @xmath37 where @xmath38 follow from higgs potential whose parameters are evaluated at the electroweak scale . the fine - tuning criterion @xmath39 in ( [ deltaew ] ) can be analyzed in comparison to the barbieri - giudice definition @xcite : @xmath40 in which the coefficients @xmath41 are evaluated at high - energy scale @xmath42 . obviously , the electroweak fine - tuning in eq .",
    "( [ deltaew ] ) can also be continued to @xmath42 scale via renormalization group running and inclusion of the threshold corrections @xcite .",
    "note that in the calculation of @xmath43 , @xmath44 are considered separately in contrast to those in eq .",
    "( [ deltaew ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath43 is calculated in terms of high scale parameters such as @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath42 denotes the highest energy scale up to which the model under concern is a valid effetive field theory . in this approach",
    ", @xmath43 contains information on possible high scale origin of the fine - tuning .",
    "gravity mediated supersymmetric theories such as msugra are , in general , assumed to be valid up to the gut scale , and hence @xmath43 is calculated with terms that are normalized at @xmath47 . in such models",
    ", @xmath48 becomes dominant because of large logarithms .",
    "also @xmath49 needs a significant contribution , @xmath50 , since it is required to evolve to negatives values from its high scale values as required by radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) @xcite .",
    "the essential observation is that light stop can hide in the top signal in the region with @xmath51 gev .",
    "the reported top results can thus contain stop signal within the exclusion limits . in the present paper ,",
    "our goal is to determine susy parameter regions accomodating light stops . in doing this , we consider constrained mssm ( cmssm ) and susy guts , and investigate their `` light stop regions '' by taking into account bounds from 125 gev higgs boson , @xmath52-physics , and cold dark matter .",
    "we also give the results for naturalness in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath43 in a general fashion .",

    "are evolved to @xmath53 via renormalization group equations ( rges ) in the @xmath54 regularization scheme .",

    "the cmssm with @xmath113 and nonuniveral gaugino masses however turns out to require much lower fine - tunings @xmath147 .",
    "this price payed for this gain in fine - tuning is the nonuniversality in gaugino masses , where the @xmath143 gaugino is more massive than the @xmath144 gaugino .    to sum up",
    ", the light stop band allowed by the lhc data is consistently realized in known models of supersymmetry at the expense of severe fine - tunings .",
