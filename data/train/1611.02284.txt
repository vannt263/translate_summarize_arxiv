    "while cavity - qed systems often contain many interacting degrees of freedom , they are unconventional from the standpoint of traditional many - body physics for two primary reasons",
    ". first , the mediation of interactions through a small number of delocalized cavity modes generally leads to extremely long - ranged interactions @xcite , which suppress the role of fluctuations and often enable accurate mean - field descriptions .",
    "in this sense they are simpler than conventional solid - state realizations of many - body physics , in which short - range interactions promote both quantum and thermal fluctuations to an important role , especially in low spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "second , cavity - qed systems are typically driven and dissipative ; as a result , even if they reach a time - independent steady state they will generally not be in thermal equilibrium @xcite . in this sense",
    "they are more complicated than conventional solid - state realizations of many - body physics , in which coupling to a thermal reservoir is typically assumed and well justified , leaving the system in thermal equilibrium and enabling the powerful tools of statistical mechanics to be employed @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", experimental advances in quantum optics have begun to blur the first of these distinctions @xcite , with platforms including exciton - polariton fluids in semiconductor quantum wells @xcite , circuit - qed @xcite , optical fibers , waveguides , and photonic crystals @xcite , small - mode - volume optical resonators @xcite , and rydberg ensembles @xcite all making progress towards realizing large - scale arrays of short - range coupled quantum optical building blocks .",
    "these developments have led many researchers to revisit fundamental questions surrounding the fate of non - equilibrium quantum - optical systems in situations where , due to the importance of either dissipative or quantum fluctuations , a mean - field description is insufficient @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to elucidate the physics of a canonical many - body model made relevant by these developments  the driven - dissipative bose hubbard model @xcite  by bringing together many closely related ideas from the many - body physics and quantum - optics communities .",
    "first and foremost , we aim to understand the effects of fluctuations on any phase transitions exhibited by the steady state of this model , and the extent to which these phase transitions do or do not admit an equilibrium description .",
    "the driven - dissipative bose - hubbard model furnishes a minimal description of , e.g. , coherently driven exciton - polariton fluids confined in coupled micro - cavities or other patterned semi - conductor devices @xcite ; our theoretical results thus have direct experimental implications , for example determining the universal spectral features of such systems near a dissipative steady - state phase transition .",
    "much of the previous work on the driven - dissipative bose - hubbard model has grown out of early proposals to simulate the equilibrium bose - hubbard model in photonic systems , either in the transient regime of very _ weakly _ dissipative systems @xcite , or through clever strategies to mitigate the effects of particle loss @xcite . in this context , the driven - dissipative model has been considered in an attempt to understand the corruption of equilibrium physics by non - vanishing dissipation in realistic systems , and to identify qualitative signatures of equilibrium bose - hubbard physics ",
    "fermionization for strong interactions @xcite or the incompressibility of the zero - temperature mott - insulating phase @xcite  that survive in steady state .",
    "the general spirit of this approach is to start from the intuitions and expectations appropriate for the equilibrium bose - hubbard model , and to build outward toward an understanding of the driven - dissipative dynamics ; numerous interesting connections to the equilibrium physics of the bose - hubbard model @xcite , as well as a variety of surprising and genuinely non - equilibrium effects @xcite , have been discovered in this manner .",
    "but there are many reasons to expect that the search for _ universal _ features of the driven - dissipative model benefits from , and perhaps even requires , a fundamentally different approach . for example , the ground - state and thermal phase transitions of the bose - hubbard model are intimately related to u(1 ) symmetry and the associated particle - number conservation @xcite . while the former can be preserved in a driven - dissipative context by pumping the cavities incoherently @xcite , the latter remains absent , calling into question whether  in the sense of phase transitions and universality_any _ properties of the bose - hubbard model can survive the presence of driving and dissipation @xcite .    here",
    ", we instead pursue an understanding of the driven - dissipative bose - hubbard model from the ground up , starting from the well understood non - equilibrium physics of a single cavity , namely optical bistability @xcite , and adopting a functional integral formalism that is well suited to extending the essential single - cavity physics to a many - body setting @xcite .",
    "as we will show , universal properties of the steady state bear essentially no resemblance to the equilibrium physics of the bose - hubbard model @xcite , but neither do they retain the fundamentally non - equilibrium character of optical bistability . instead , the steady state of the driven - dissipative bose - hubbard model admits an emergent equilibrium description in terms of a finite - temperature classical ising model @xcite .",
    "specifically ( see fig.[fig : schematic ] ) , two collective mean - field steady states are inherited from the optical bistability of the individual cavities ; they play the role of the two local minima in the ising model s mean - field free energy , while dissipation ( i.e.vacuum fluctuations ) plays the role of thermal fluctuations , setting the effective temperature . by connecting two canonical and minimal models of many - body physics ",
    "one a cornerstone of non - equilibrium quantum optics and one a cornerstone of traditional equilibrium many - body physics ",
    "this paper provides a particularly simple and concrete example of the way in which equilibrium can emerge very naturally from an _ a priori _ non - equilibrium many - body problem , even when mean - field theory fails .",
    "we note that our conclusions build on and justify a preliminary analysis reported in ref.@xcite , where a renormalization - group argument in favor of the ising universality class was advanced . in the present work ,",
    "we identify a small parameter @xmath0 related to the inverse `` system size '' ( in the sense of the system - size expansion often employed in quantum - optics studies of systems with only a few degrees of freedom ) , which controls the overall scale of fluctuations , and thus the effective temperature . in the limit of weak fluctuations ,",
    "the qualitative predictions of ref.@xcite can be justified , made quantitative , and verified numerically . in this way",
    ", we not only identify the model with respect to which an effective thermal description emerges , but also semi - quantitatively obtain the phase boundaries , effective temperature , and near - critical dynamics in terms of microscopic parameters .",
    "is a parameter controlling the density scale , i.e. @xmath1 . hence the low temperature limit of the ising model corresponds to a semi - classical ( large density ) limit of optical bistability . ]    before proceeding , we caution that the emergence of an effective equilibrium description as described in this paper , while potentially reasonably generic , should not be taken for granted ; other more genuinely non - equilibrium situations can and do arise in other models @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the goal of this paper is not only to provide a detailed view into the mechanisms by which thermal equilibrium can emerge from the microscopically non - equilibrium setting of many - body cavity - qed , nor by any means to insist that one must emerge , but also to clarify some of the techniques required to understand more unusual behaviors made possible by the strong - coupling regime of quantum optics .",
    "it is natural to expect that analyses of prototypical situations in which equilibrium _ does _ emerge will play an important role in anticipating more exotic situations in which it does _",
    "not_.    after presenting the model and reviewing the well - known solution of the single - cavity case in sec.[sec : model ] , our general strategy for the many - body problem will be laid out in sec.[sec : formalism ] .",
    "our approach is based on a well - established exact mapping of the master equation onto a functional integral .",
    "although it imposes some additional notational burden , the functional integral formalism has the virtue of ( 1 ) being a convenient starting point for the identification of approximation schemes , including controlled strategies for going beyond mean - field theory @xcite , and ( 2 ) enabling powerful techniques such as the renormalization group to be applied @xcite . here",
    ", we use the path integral to quickly identify an exactly solvable limit of the problem , around which a semi - classical expansion ( related to the system - size expansion of quantum optics ) can be made . to leading non - trivial order in this expansion",
    ", we obtain a quantitatively accurate mapping of the many - body quantum master equation onto classical non - equilibrium langevin equations , with a small parameter controlling the strength of the noise .",
    "in sec.[sec : mft ] we analyze the mean - field equations of motion near the mean - field critical point , which possess an emergent @xmath2 symmetry in the spirit of ref.@xcite .",
    "we show how the complex order parameter decomposes into two real components , one of which stays massive at the critical point and one of which does not . by adiabatically eliminating the massive component",
    ", we arrive at a time - dependent landau - ginsburg equation for a scalar field , which supports two different homogeneous solutions within the bistable region . near the critical point and inside the bistable region",
    ", we are able to analytically obtain the profile and velocity of domain walls separating domains of these two different phases , and the vanishing of the domain wall velocity gives a zeroth - order approximation to the location of a true ( first - order ) phase transition in more than one spatial dimension . in sec.[sec : langevin ] we consider the effects of fluctuations in both one and two spatial dimensions by ( a ) arguing that  near the critical point and for weak noise  the non - linear langevin equations become equivalent to model a of the hohenberg and halperin classification , and ( b ) solving the non - equilibrium langevin equations numerically , which is valid even away from the critical point . as our earlier analysis would suggest , the numerical results are qualitatively consistent with the expected equilibrium physics of a classical ising model in a longitudinal field . in one dimension ,",
    "domains are seeded by fluctuations , and the dynamics of their unbound domain walls smooths the mean - field transition into a crossover . in 2d",
    "the domains walls exhibit a surface tension , enabling a line of true first - order phase transitions terminating at a critical point .",
    "the model we consider can arise in a variety of contexts , but for concreteness we consider either a 1d chain or 2d rectangular array of semiconductor microcavities supporting exciton - polaritons ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the onsite energies of exciton - polaritons are spatially uniform and equal to @xmath3 , and that the cavities are driven coherently and in phase by a laser with frequency @xmath4 . upon making a unitary transformation to remove the time - dependence of the driving",
    ", we obtain the hamiltonian @xmath5 here , @xmath6 creates(anihilates ) an exciton - polariton in the @xmath7th cavity , @xmath8 parametrizes the strength of a coherent coupling of exciton - polaritons between neighboring cavities , @xmath9 is the detuning of the laser from cavity resonance , @xmath10 sets the two - body interaction energy for exciton - polaritons confined in the same cavity , and @xmath11 is the amplitude of the coherent driving .",

    "steady - state expectation values can even be obtained analytically by mapping the single - cavity version of eq . onto phase - space equations in the complex - p representation @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite provides a comprehensive discussion of the solution , and here we simply summarize its main features , focusing primarily on the relationship between the exact and mean - field solutions . while the mean - field equations of motion can support two dynamically stable steady states , the exact steady - state density matrix of eq .",
    "is always unique , as are all observables calculated from it ( for example , see fig.[fig : mf_phase_diagram]b ) .",
    "while there are never two truly stable steady states , two important signatures of mean - field bistability do survive in the limit of large cavity occupancy : ( 1 ) the full - counting statistics of the exact solution exhibits a bimodal structure within the parameter regime yielding mean - field bistability , with the probability of observing different photon numbers clustering around the two mean - field stable values of the density ( fig.[fig : mf_phase_diagram]c ) .",
    "outside of the bistable region , this bimodality disappears and the exact counting statistics becomes similar to that corresponding to the one stable mean - field solution ; in this sense , the exact solution interpolates between the two mean - field steady states within the bistable region .",
    "( 2 ) if the system is initialized in one of the mean - field steady states , it will only explore the phase space in the vicinity of that solution on the natural time scales of the problem ( i.e. those associated with energy scales appearing explicitly in the master equation ) , and will only sample the phase space in the vicinity of the other mean - field solution on much longer time scales ( fig.[fig : mf_phase_diagram]d ) . this slow time - scale for switching between mean - field - like steady states",
    "is associated with a small gap of the exact quantum liouvillian , which vanishes inside the bistable region in the limit of large photon occupancy @xcite . in this limit , which plays a role analogous to the `` thermodynamic limit '' of a spatially extended system , mean - field bistability",
    "can therefore be identified with the existence of a ( zero - dimensional ) dissipative phase transition .",

    "the factor @xmath31 in eq . is the wigner function at the initial time @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being shorthand for the set of field variables @xmath34 at the initial time . in this paper",
    "we will only concern ourselves with steady state properties , and so we can safely set @xmath35 in the integral limits of eq . and exclude the dependence on @xmath36 from @xmath30 . from here forward the integral limits of @xmath37 in the action will be implied and not shown .",
    "the classical hamiltonian @xmath38 in eq . is the weyl - symbol of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "@xcite ; this should be contrasted with the usual appearance of the q - symbol in the keldysh functional integral ( see appendix [ sec : appendix_a ] for a derivation of this functional integral and further discussion of the emergence of weyl - ordering ) .    the functional integral in eq .",
    "is suited to calculating products of operators that are ordered along a closed - time ( or keldysh ) contour @xcite .",
    "in particular , writing the so - called classical ( @xmath39 ) and quantum ( @xmath40 ) fields as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and writing creation / anihilation operators as @xmath43 , keldysh - ordered correlation functions can be computed as ( restoring spatial / temporal indices and defining @xmath44 ) @xmath45 on the left - hand - side of eq . the expectation value is taken with respect to the initial density matrix , and the operators evolve in the heisenberg picture .",

    "( @xmath30 is normalized to unity by construction , as it expresses the trace of the density matrix ) . in the calculations that follow ,",
    "we will exploit a semi - classical limit in which the quantum field is , in a sense to be made precise , parametrically smaller than the classical field ; thus we will be primarily interested in correlations of the classical field alone , which can be converted into operator expectation values by inverting eq .",
    ", @xmath49 while it may appear that such correlation functions can be discontinuous at coinciding times due to the associated change of operator ordering on the right - hand - side of eq . , it is straightforward to show that this is not actually the case . instead , when the times approach each other ( @xmath50 ) , the limit of an arbitrary @xmath51-point correlation function of the classical field @xmath39 smoothly approaches the equal - time value @xmath52 where @xmath53 symmetrizes ( i.e. weyl - orders ) products of creation and annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "in other words , equal - time correlation functions of the classical field reproduce the average of weyl - ordered operator products . for example",
    ", the density can be computed from the two - point correlation function @xmath54    the weyl - symbol of @xmath15 is given by ( ignoring additive constants , which do not affect correlation functions ) @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the discrete laplacian , the lattice coordination number @xmath57 in @xmath58 dimensions , and @xmath59 .",
    "inserting eq . into eq .",
    "yields the action @xmath60    because the path integral is gaussian for @xmath61 , and because optical bistability at the mean - field level can occur at arbitrarily small values of @xmath10 , one might hope that some aspects of the relevant physics can be captured by doing perturbation theory in @xmath10 .",
    "however , this is not the case ; while optical bistability can indeed occur for small @xmath10 , it always occurs when the typical interaction energy per particle , @xmath62 , is comparable to the other energy scales of the problem .",
    "nevertheless , the action can still be organized around a small parameter that enables a controlled approximation . to this end",
    ", we define rescaled fields and parameters @xmath63 in terms of which the action can be rewritten @xmath64 the dimensionless parameter @xmath65 implicitly identifies a one - dimensional family of actions at fixed values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath14 , @xmath68 , and @xmath8 , one limit of which ( large @xmath65 ) will be shown to admit a tractable analysis . note that the limit @xmath69 at fixed @xmath67 and @xmath66 is not the same thing as the limit @xmath70 , even though the coupling @xmath10 does become small in this limit . rather , increasing @xmath65 amounts to increasing the drive strength @xmath11 while simultaneously decreasing the coupling @xmath10 in such a way that the typical interaction energy per particle , @xmath62 , remains constant .    to see this",
    ", we first evaluate the path integral in the limit @xmath69 , in which only the first term in the action survives .",
    "the functional integral over @xmath71 can be carried out and yields a functional @xmath72-function of the term inside parentheses , thereby enforcing the mean - field equation of motion @xmath73 note that at this level of approximation , varying @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 held fixed leaves the equation of motion for @xmath74 invariant .",
    "therefore , as discussed above , the interaction energy per photon @xmath75 stays fixed .",
    "the only consequence is that the actually density , @xmath76 , is enhanced by a factor of @xmath65 , which therefore sets the overall density scale @xcite .",
    "for @xmath65 large but finite , the first term on the second line of eq .",
    "suppresses contributions to the path integral unless @xmath77 .",
    "the final term can therefore be estimated as @xmath78 , and can be safely ignored in the large @xmath65 limit . at this level of approximation ,",
    "the path integral can no longer be solved exactly , but it can be mapped onto stochastic classical equations by standard techniques .",
    "decoupling the term that is quadratic in @xmath71 with a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , @xmath79 the action again becomes linear in @xmath71 .",
    "this time , for fixed @xmath80 , the functional integral over @xmath71 enforces enforces the equation of motion @xmath81 the remaining functional integral over @xmath80 with a gaussian weight @xmath82 indicates that we should interpret eq . as a stochastic differential equation , with @xmath80 being complex , gaussian white noise of variance ( restoring spatial and temporal indices ) @xmath83 hence the dynamics of the rescaled classical field @xmath74 , to this order in @xmath0 , is governed by a stochastic and dissipative gross - pitaevskii equation with parametrically weak noise . rather than @xmath84 owing to the weyl - ordering of the hamiltonian .",
    "the additional term , however , should not be retained when making a consistent expansion in @xmath0 . ]",
    ". can also be derived using more standard phase space techniques , the path integral approach has the advantage that one can assess the consequences of the approximations that lead to eq . within the framework of the renormalization group . in particular , as discussed in ref.@xcite , eq .",
    "should reproduce the correct critical exponents for the phase transition exhibited by the exact steady state of eq .. unlike in ref.@xcite , however , here we have explicitly identified a limit ( large @xmath65 ) in which eq .",
    "yields asymptotically exact results for microscopic observables , and thus can be used to make quantitative predictions about the behavior of correlation functions at the lattice - scale ( rather than just qualitative predictions about their long - distance asymptotics ) . moreover",
    ", the existence of this limit furnishes a more formal justification for the type of perturbative renormalization - group analysis carried out in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that , even for a single cavity , eqs . and must be interpreted with some care in order to correctly extract steady - state properties in the large-@xmath65 limit .",
    "the reason is simply that , returning to the full path integral , the limits @xmath69 and @xmath85 do not commute when the parameters are tuned to be inside the mean - field bistable region .",
    "indeed , if we take the limit @xmath69 first , eq . is exact at all times , and we are lead to conclude ( on the same basis as the analysis in sec.[sec : model ] ) that there are two stable steady states .",
    "if we instead take the large @xmath86 limit first , we would find [ based on the analysis of @xmath0 corrections contained in eq . ]",
    "that there is a unique steady state at any finite value of @xmath65 , which is a fluctuation - induced admixture of the two stable steady states computed by reversing the order of limits . if we now take the large-@xmath65 limit , one of those steady states is generally preferred over the other , in the sense that it alone determines all steady - state expectation values .",
    "thus we encounter a sudden ( first - order ) phase transition between a bright and a dark state when traversing through the mean - field bistable region .",
    "and @xmath87 control deviations in a non - orthogonal coordinate system spanned by the dashed arrow .",
    "( b ) setting @xmath88 and scanning @xmath89 from positive to negative causes the order parameter to undergo a cusp bifurcation , at which the solution outside the bistable region goes unstable ( dashed line ) and two new dynamically stable steady states ( solid lines ) emerge continuously . in both plots @xmath90 , and energies are given as dimensionless ratios with @xmath68 . ]    from the above considerations it is clear that , at least in the large @xmath65 limit , the steady state can be understood by solving the mean - field equations of motion in the presence of parametrically weak noise .",
    "thus we expect a detailed understanding of the mean - field dynamics in the absence of noise to form a useful starting point for understanding the dynamics of eq .. at the level of eq . , and",
    "assuming that only uniform steady states exist , the steady - state phase diagram is identical to that of single - cavity optical bistability , up to the replacement of @xmath72 by @xmath68 . in terms of the rescaled field @xmath74 and a rescaled density @xmath91 , eq . becomes @xmath92 straightforward analysis of eq .",
    "shows that upon entering the bistable region from outside of it , the additional solution does not in general emerge continuously from the existing one .",
    "however , if one enters the bistable region through the cusp located at ( see fig.[fig : mf_coordinates ] ) @xmath93 the two solutions do emerge continuously from a single solution , @xmath94 ( with critical density @xmath95 ) .",
    "therefore , we can identify the cusp of the bistable region as a mean - field critical point locating a continuous phase transition from one to two steady states .",
    "it is straightforward to show that one can only enter the bistable region through the critical point along the line @xmath96",
    ". it will be convenient in what follows to define new coordinates in the @xmath14-@xmath66 parameter space that naturally parametrize deviations from the mean - field critical point along and away from this line , @xmath97 note that this parameter transformation is designed so that only @xmath89 varies as we enter the bistable region through the critical point ",
    "the overall normalization of @xmath89 and @xmath87 is arbitrary , and chosen to make the formulas that follow simpler .",
    "these new variables can be visualized as parameterizing deviations from the mean - field critical point in the non - orthogonal coordinate system shown in fig.[fig : mf_coordinates]a . for @xmath88 , moving from @xmath98 to @xmath99 causes the mean - field solution outside of the bistable region to undergo a cusp bifurcation ( fig.[fig : mf_coordinates]b ) .",
    "for @xmath99 , sweeping @xmath87 from negative to positive traverses the bistable region in such a way that the system goes from supporting only a low - density solution , to having coexisting low - density and high - density solutions , and then eventually to supporting only a high - density solution .",
    "this behavior is in close analogy to that of an ising model : if the dark and bright solutions are identified with the up / down - symmetry - related free - energy minima , then @xmath89 plays the role or the reduced temperature and @xmath87 plays the role of a symmetry - breaking ( longitudinal ) field , causing one to be preferred over the other",
    ". the remainder of sec.[sec : mft ] will formalize this analogy , and in sec.[sec : langevin ] we will argue that it continues to hold even when fluctuations are included .",
    "we are particularly interested in the effects of fluctuations in the vicinity of the mean - field critical point , which requires that we first understand the mean - field response when ( a ) the parameters are tuned close to the mean - field critical point ( both @xmath89 and @xmath87 are small ) and ( b ) the order parameter @xmath74 is perturbed weakly from its steady - state value .",
    "first working directly at the critical point ( @xmath100 , with steady - state solution @xmath101 ) and assuming that @xmath102 is uniform and close to the critical value , we expand eq . to first order in @xmath103 to obtain @xmath104 the r.h.s .",
    "is purely real , and thus only the real part of @xmath103 decays ; the dynamics stops when the r.h.s vanishes , i.e. when @xmath105 .",
    "this observation motivates the following decomposition of the complex - valued @xmath103 into two real components , @xmath106 with the expectation that @xmath107 and @xmath108 will relax quickly and slowly , respectively , in the vicinity of the mean - field critical point . inserting this decomposition into eq . but now keeping all orders in @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we obtain coupled non - linear differential equations for @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( see appendix [ sec : appendix_b ] for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the fast variable @xmath107 can be adiabatically eliminated by solving @xmath109 for @xmath107 ( perturbatively in @xmath89 and @xmath87 ) and inserting the solution into the equation of motion for @xmath108 . in this way ,",
    "to lowest nontrivial order in @xmath89 we obtain @xmath110 note that we have also dropped higher - order derivative terms for @xmath108 that arise from the adiabatic elimination of @xmath107 ; this omission turns out to be justified ( to lowest non - trival order in @xmath89 ) near the mean - field critical point , where the fields vary slowly in space , even when @xmath8 is not small compared to the other energy scales in eq .",
    "( the perturbative adiabatic elimination of @xmath107 is explained in detail in appendix [ sec : appendix_b ] ) . restoring spatial indices and defining parameters @xmath111 eq .",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath112 where the effective hamiltonian @xmath113 is defined @xmath114 note that , as anticipated , @xmath113 is precisely the energy functional defining the landau theory of a classical ising model , with @xmath108 playing the role of the magnetization .",
    "equation indicates that the dynamics of the slow field in the vicinity of the critical point is purely relaxational , evolving towards the minimum of the effective potential @xmath113 .      at the level of mean - field theory",
    "there are two truly stable homogeneous solutions within the bistable region .",
    "however , it is clear that if we place the system in one of the two mean - field steady states , the inclusion of fluctuations will seed defects of the other steady state ; whether these defects shrink or grow will depend on the dynamics of the domain wall separating them from the bulk , and will determine which of the two mean - field steady states is preferred over the other .",

    "the domain walls enclosing these defects move independently of each other when they are sufficiently far apart , undergoing a biased random walk . as a result , when @xmath144 and the dynamics becomes unbiased , defects proliferate and the system will be disordered at any finite temperature . in two or more spatial dimensions , defects of the less favored phase will still be seeded by fluctuations , but small defects contract aggressively even as @xmath144 due to a surface tension .",

    "since the above argument relies very little on the dynamics being relaxational , and primarily on the existence of domain walls that  in the absence of fluctuations and for asymptotically large domains  have a directional preference that changes as we move through the bistable region , it is reasonable to expect the qualitative picture described above to be valid even away from the critical point .",
    "nevertheless , because the dynamics generated by eq . does not induce an equilibrium steady - state distribution far away from the critical point , it is important to verify this picture numerically . to this end",

    "by bringing together a number of ideas from both quantum optics and condensed - matter physics , we have identified a limit of the driven - dissipative bose - hubbard model in which the dominant fluctuations are captured by non - equilibrium langevin equations , enabling a quantitatively accurate and computationally efficient determination of steady - state properties . near the critical point , these fluctuations are thermal and lead to an effective equilibrium description .",

    "we caution that any claims about the universality class of the phase transition require more than just a microscopically accurate treatment of fluctuations ",

    "it would be worthwhile to extend the numerical approach taken in sec.[sec : langevin ] to confirm the universal aspects of both the critical point and the first - order phase transition .",
    "it would also be worthwhile to compare some of the results in 1d with numerically exact calculations based on the density - matrix renormalization group @xcite in order to better understand the importance of higher - order ( in @xmath0 ) corrections that are not captured by the langevin description .",
