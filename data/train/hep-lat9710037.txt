    "much of our knowledge about qcd and the structure of hadrons has been derived from deep - inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "while most work to date has been on the nucleon , there are proposals to investigate the structure functions of mesons  @xcite . in this talk we shall consider @xmath0 and @xmath1 targets .    no polarization is possible for the @xmath0 , so we have two structure functions : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath1 , being a spin 1 particle , has eight structure functions  @xcite : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the structure functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 receive contributions from twist - four ( and higher ) operators only and so will not concern us here .",
    "we shall also not consider the structure function @xmath5 , which is least likely that it will be measured .",
    "writing @xmath10 we find for the moments of the @xmath0 structure functions @xmath11 while the moments of the @xmath1 structure functions are given by @xmath12 where the @xmath13 s are the wilson coefficients , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the operator matrix elements .",

    "if the quarks are in a pure @xmath28-wave state , we would expect @xmath6 to vanish .",
    "the other structure functions have more or less the same interpretation as in case of the nucleon .",
    "we have generated 500 quenched gauge field configurations on a @xmath29 lattice at @xmath30 . on these configurations",
    "we have computed the matrix elements @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , using wilson fermions .",
    "the calculations are done for three hopping parameters , @xmath31 , 0.1530 and 0.1550 , corresponding roughly to quark masses of 190 , 130 and 70 mev , respectively .",
    "the matrix elements can be obtained from the ratio of three- to two - point functions  @xcite @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the source / sink . for the @xmath0 we have @xmath35 while for the @xmath1 we have @xmath36 a typical such ratio is shown in fig .  1",
    ".    the operators will give in general divergent results as the lattice spacing goes to zero .",
    "they must be renormalized in the same way the wilson coefficients must be renormalized .",
    "we define finite operators renormalized at the scale @xmath37 by ( @xmath38 being the lattice constant ) @xmath39 the renormalization constants @xmath40 have been computed to one loop order in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "we work at a scale of @xmath41 . we shall present our results as a series of plots . in fig .",
    "2 we show the moments of the @xmath0 structure function @xmath2 . for the lowest moment , @xmath42 , we find that it is somewhat larger than the phenomenological result .",
    "the higher moments are in better agreement .",
    "this is similar to what has been found for the nucleon structure functions  @xcite .",
    "the unpolarized @xmath1 structure function looks very similar to the @xmath0 structure function , so that we will not discuss it here . in fig .",
    "3 we show the moments of the polarized @xmath1 structure function @xmath4 .",
    "the lowest moment @xmath43 indicates that the valence quarks carry about @xmath44 of the total spin of the @xmath1 . a similar calculation for",
    "the nucleon gave a quark spin fraction of the same value  @xcite .",
    "4 we show the moments of the polarized @xmath1 structure function @xmath6 . the lowest moment turns out to be positive and surprisingly large , albeit with large statistical errors . perhaps this indicates that the valence quarks have a substantial orbital angular momentum .",
