    "our goal is to derive an evolution equation for which the set of g - nonentangled states is invariant for arbitrary hamiltonian , and discuss its physical interpretation .    in the next section we recapitulate the theory of generalized entanglement and generalized purity . in section 3",
    "we treat a quantum dynamical system on @xmath1 as a classical hamiltonian system on @xmath9 , which enables us to discuss constrained quantum dynamics .",
    "this is used to derive an evolution equation of the states which preserves the maximal generalized purity , that is of the g - nonentangled states .",
    "this evolution equation is nonlinear and can generate , depending on the hamiltonian , chaotic dynamics of the coarse - grained system .",
    "open quantum system model of the evolution of the distinguished states is discussed in section 4 . in this section",
    "we show that our constrained evolution equation coincides in the weak coupling limit with the approximate evolution equation of the robust states derived in @xcite by different means and in the context of decoherence theory .",
    "a selected set of distinguished observables is used to define the generalized notions of non - entangled and entangled states .",
    "the coarse - graining by the distinguished observables , understood in the traditional probabilistic sens as replacing probabilities by conditional probabilities is crucial in this definition .    consider a subset @xmath10 of distinguished observables .",

    "otherwise the pure state @xmath18 is g - entangled . in the case that the hilbert space has the bipartite tensor product structure and each distinguished observable act nontrivially only in one of the components , the previous definition of g - entanglement reduces to the standard definition of the bipartite entanglement for pure states .    in a large class of situations of physical interest",
    "the set of distinguished observables forms a lie algebra . in this case",
    "a measure of the generalized entanglement of the pure state @xmath18 is provided by the generalized purity , which is the purity of the reduced state @xmath19 , and is given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 form a bases of the lie algebra @xmath12 .",

    "once the distinguished observables are chosen , the question if the future orbit of a g - nonentangled @xmath18 will remain in the set of g - nonentangled states depends on the evolution equation satisfied by @xmath18 .    an equivalent measures of g - entanglement is given by the total dispersion of the algebra of distinguished observables @xmath24 @xmath25 is minimal iff @xmath22 is maximal .",

    "is not enough and a nonlinear constrain has to be added to ensure the preservation of the g - purity @xmath34 . in order to formulate such constrained evolution we shall use the classical hamiltonian formulation of the quantum evolution .",
    "it is well known ( please see @xcite or @xcite and references therein ) that the evolution of a quantum pure state in @xmath1 as given by the schroedinger equation can be equivalently described by a hamiltonian dynamical system on @xmath9 with the evolution equations in the hamiltonian form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the vector of coordinates @xmath37 and momenta @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are complex expansion coefficients of the pure state @xmath18 in some basis .",

    "however , the formalism of the so called metrical constraints , developed in @xcite , with an arbitrary number of real functions defining the constraint submanifold is applicable . for the benefit of the reader we shall rederive the constrained dynamical equations with only one real constraint which is of interest here .",

    "the open system dynamics is given by the lindblad master equation . in this limit , and if the lindblad operators are taken to represent the distinguished observables then the constrained equations for the g - coherent states developed here coincide with previously suggested @xcite evolution equation for the pointer states of the open system .",
    "our simplified constrained evolution equation ( 15 ) for the g - nonentangled states coincides with the deterministic part of the ito stochastic schroedinger equation developed in the quantum state diffusion theory ( qsd ) of open system dynamics.the stochastic schroedinger equation describes dynamics of any random pure state .",
    "our constrained equations describe dynamics of deterministic pure states which are in the subset of all pure states that remain pure during the evolution . from a formal point of view , it would be interesting to derive the qsd stochastic equations using the formalism of constraints , where the constraint would be given by random variables representing the obtained results of measurements with gaussian distribution .",
