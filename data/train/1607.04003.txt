    "ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) are used to produce and study a hot and dense medium consisting of strongly interacting quarks and gluons , namely quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is expected to exist in the early stage of the universe , and to understand its properties , such as the equation of state ( eos ) , transport coefficients .",
    "the hadronic interactions are expected to have less influence on the multi - strange hadrons , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , due to their much smaller hadronic cross sections .",
    "therefore , final observables of these multi - strange hadrons are more sensitive to the early ( partonic ) stage of the collision . in the past few decades ,",
    "different aspects of strange and multi - strange hadrons have been investigated theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "anisotropic flow , which is considered as an evidence for the qgp formation , typically displays the collective behavior of the final emitted particles .",
    "it can be characterized by the coefficients of the fourier expansion of the final particle azimuthal distribtion defined as  @xcite : @xmath9 )   \\label{eq : flowvn}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 order anisotropic flow harmonic with its corresponding reaction plane angle @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle of the final emitted particles .",
    "recently , the anisotropic flow and other soft hadron data of all charged and identified hadrons at the rhic and lhc have been studied by many groups within the framework of hydrodynamics  @xcite . using the vishnu hybrid model  @xcite , connecting ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics with a hadronic afterburner ,",
    "the specific qgp shear viscosity value of @xmath14 are extracted from the elliptic flow measurements of charged hadrons with mc - kln initial conditions  @xcite . with the extracted @xmath14 ,",
    "the vishnu provides good descriptions of the soft hadron data of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 at the rhic and lhc  @xcite .",
    "compared with other common hadrons , anisotropy flow of ( multi-)strange particles are mainly produced in the qgp stage and less contaminated by the subsequent hadronic interactions .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath0-spectra and elliptic flow for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 have been measured in the au+au collisions at the rhic  @xcite and pb+pb collisions at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is the right time to systematically study these strange and multi - strange hadrons at rhic and lhc via the vishnu hybrid model .    in this paper , we investigate the @xmath0-spectra and elliptic flow @xmath5 for ( multi-)strange hadrons in au+au collisions at @xmath15200 gev and in pb+pb collisions at @xmath152.76 tev within the viscous hydrodynamic hybrid model vishnu .",

    "[ sec : comresults ] compares our vishnu results in au+au collisions and pb+pb collisions with the measurements from the star at rhic and alice at lhc , respectively , mainly including @xmath0-spectra and differential elliptic flow for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . in sec .",

    "sec : summary ] .",
    "we here give brief descriptions of the inputs and setup of vishnu calculations for the soft data at the rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the vishnu  @xcite is a hybrid model combining ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ultrarelativistic viscous hydrodynamics vish2 + 1  @xcite for the expansion of strongly interacting matter qgp and a microscopic hadronic cascade model ( urqmd )  @xcite for the hadronic evolution . in the calculations",
    "a switching temperature @xmath16 of 165 mev is set for the transition from the macroscopic to microscopic approaches in vishnu .",
    "this switching temperature value is close to the qcd phase transition temperature  @xcite . for the hydrodynamic evolution above @xmath16",
    ", we input the equation of state s95p - pce , which was constructed by matching the lattice qcd data at high temperature to a chemically frozen hadron resonance gas  @xcite .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we input mc - kln initial conditions  @xcite and start the hydrodynamic simulations at @xmath17 . for improving computational efficiency , we implement single - shot simulations  @xcite with smooth initial entropy density profiles generated by the mc - kln model .",
    "the smooth initial entropy densities are obtained by averaging over a large number of fluctuating entropy density profiles within a specific centrality class .",
    "the initial density profiles are initialized with the reaction plane method , which was once used in  @xcite .",
    "considering the conversion from total initial entropies to final multiplicity of all charged hadrons , we do the centrality selection through the distribution of total initial entropies that are obtained from the event - by - event fluctuating profiles .",
    "such centrality classification was firstly used by shen in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is more close to the experimental one defined from the measured multiplicity distributions .",
    "the normalization factors for the initial entropy densities in au+au collisions and pb+pb collisions are respectively fixed to reproduce the charged hadron multiplicity density @xmath18 with @xmath19 at the rhic  @xcite and @xmath20 at the lhc  @xcite at most central collisions .",
    "the @xmath21 parameter in the mc - kln model , which quantifies the gluon saturation scale in the initial gluon distributions  @xcite , is tuned to @xmath22 at the rhic and @xmath23 at the lhc for a better description of the centrality dependent multiplicity density for all charged hadrons .    in the vishnu simulations with mc - kln initial conditions",
    ", we set a value of 0.16 for the qgp specific shear viscosity @xmath14 .",
    "such combined setting in vishnu calculations once nicely described the elliptic flow of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 in au+au collisions  @xcite and pb+pb collisions  @xcite . here , we continue to use it to further study the soft hadron data of strange and multi - strange hadrons at both rhic and lhc . for simplicity the theoretical calculations",
    ", we neglect the bulk viscosity , net baryon density , and the heat conductivity in the qgp system evolution .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : ptrhic ] , we present the transverse momentum spectra of hadrons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in au+au collisions at @xmath15200 gev from the vishnu hybrid model , and compare these results with the star measurements . in our calculations , the production of @xmath1 is obtained from the original values without contribution from weak decays . for the star measurements ,",
    "the @xmath1 spectra are corrected for the feed - down of multi - strange baryon weak decays ( the feed - down contributions to the @xmath2 spectra from @xmath3 decays are negligible )  @xcite .",
    "we find that the vishnu generally describes the @xmath24-spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , but slightly overestimates the production of @xmath3 at all centrality classes .",
    "furthermore , we notice that star measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath25 are slightly larger than their corresponding anti - particles due to non - zero baryon density at this collision energy . in our calculations , however , zero net baryon density is used , which leads to the same results between these ( multi-)strange hadrons and their anti - particle partners .",
    "we also calculate the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in pb+pb collisions at lhc with our vishnu hybrid model .",
    "the calculations , compared with the measurements from the alice collaboration , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptlhc ] . for the alice measurements , the production differences between these ( multi-)strange hadrons and their anti - particles are very small due to very small net baryon density at the lhc energies .",
    "it also shows that the vishnu generally describes the @xmath24-spectra of hadrons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 from the most central to semi - peripheral collisions , except for the 60 - 80% centrality bin . here",
    ", our theoretical calculations of @xmath1 are plotted with the original values from vishnu without weak decays . as a result",
    ", they are about 30% lower than the alice measurements , which are not corrected for the feed - down from non - weak decays of @xmath26 and @xmath27 family  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 spectra from vishnu are slightly higher than the experimental data at these centrality classes , as similarly observed in the calculations at the rhic .",
    "such deviations between theory and experiment are consistent with the model and data differences for the centrality dependent multiplicity shown in  @xcite .    from comparisons between our calculations and measurements at the rhic and lhc",
    ", we find that , although the vishnu can not fully reproduce the @xmath0-spectra of these strange and multi - strange hadrons in the production amount , it gives nice descriptions of the slopes for the spectra of them at various centralities .",
    "together with the early nice descriptions of the @xmath24-spectra for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8  @xcite , it reveals that during its qgp and hadronic evolution the vishnu hybrid model generates a proper amount of radial flow to push the spectra of various hadrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : v2rhic ] presents the comparisons of differential elliptic flow of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 from the vishnu model with the star measurements in au+au collisions at @xmath15200 gev .",
    "the theoretical curves are calculated from vishnu model by using reaction plane initial conditions from the mc - kln model and @xmath28 .",
    "the experimental data are from the star , which are measured with the event plane method  @xcite .",
    "this method covers a fraction of contribution from event - by - event flow fluctuations and non - flow contribution mainly including resonance decays and jets .",
    "compared with star measurements , the elliptic flow from the vishnu generally reproduce the data for @xmath1 at 0 - 10% and 10 - 40% , and for @xmath2 and @xmath3 at 0 - 30% centrality classes . at semi - peripheral collisions ,",
    "the model gives roughly descriptions of the data for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 at @xmath29 , but under - estimates at higher @xmath0 region . together with the failed descriptions of elliptic flow for charged hadrons and identified lighter hadrons at semi - peripheral collisions in ref .",
    "@xcite , it reflects that the vishnu , with the mc - kln initial conditions , fails to describe the semi - peripheral collisions probably due to non local thermal equilibrium at these collisions at the rhic .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2lhc ] , we show the differential elliptic flow of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 at 10 - 20% , 30 - 40% , and 50 - 60% pb+pb collisions , which were first given in ref .",
    "the presented experimental data are measured by the alice collaboration with the scalar product method  @xcite .",
    "the vishnu theoretical results are calculated with the inputs as presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] .",
    "[ fig : v2lhc ] shows that the vishnu fairly predicts the elliptic flow data for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 at chosen three centrality classes at @xmath30 within the statistical error bars . at @xmath31 ,",
    "the descriptions of the elliptic flow for @xmath2 at 50 - 60% and for @xmath3 at 30 - 40% and 50 - 60% become worse . together with the worse descriptions of elliptic flow data at high-@xmath0 at the rhic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2rhic ] , we consider that the viscous corrections probably become too large at high-@xmath0 region , in which the hydrodynamic description in the vishnu lost its predictive power .",
    "it is widely accepted that the characteristic mass ordering of differential elliptic flow among various identified hadrons at low-@xmath0 reflects the interplay between radial and elliptic flow , providing more insights into the properties of the qgp fireball .",
    "the radial flow creates a depletion in the particle @xmath24-spectrum at low values , which increases with increasing particle mass .",
    "this leads to heavier particles having a smaller @xmath5 compared to lighter ones at a given value of @xmath24 , giving a mass ordering of the @xmath24 dependent elliptic flow below @xmath32 .",
    "such @xmath33 mass ordering has been discovered in the experiments at both the rhic and lhc  @xcite , which has also been studied within the framework of hydrodynamics  @xcite and blastwave model  @xcite .",

    "the measurements of elliptic flow of various hadron species are taken from star  @xcite and alice  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : v2mass],height=340 ]    here we investigate the mass ordering of the elliptic flow among various identified hadrons @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in au+au collisions and pb+pb collisions .",
    "for clear presentations , the experimental data and our vishnu results are plotted in separate panels at 0 - 80% at the rhic and 30 - 40% at the lhc .",
    "together with the calculations of elliptic flow of identified hadrons in  @xcite and in this paper , we find that the vishnu generally describes the @xmath34 for different identified hadrons at several centrality classes .",
    "however , our theoretical results presented in fig .  [ fig : v2mass ] , compared with the measurements at rhic and lhc , show that the vishnu fairly describes the mass ordering among @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath3 , but fails to correctly describe the mass ordering among @xmath8 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 due to slight under - prediction of @xmath33 for @xmath8 .",
    "this under - prediction for proton leads to an inverse @xmath33 mass ordering between @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "effects of hadronic rescattering on elliptic flow are seen to be particle specific , depending on their scattering cross sections that couple them to the medium  @xcite .",
    "compared with non - strange hadrons , the multi - strange hadrons are less affected on their differential elliptic flow due to their smaller scattering cross sections .",
    "therefore , re - evaluating the hadronic cross sections in the urqmd is helpful to improve the description of elliptic flow of various hadron species .",
    "meanwhile , an initial flow could enhance the radial flow in the hadronic stage , which is also expected to improve the description of mass ordering within the framework of the hybrid model .",
    "in this paper , we studied the @xmath0-spectra and elliptic flow of strange and multi - strange hadrons in au+au and pb+pb collisions within the vishnu hybrid model . at both collision systems",
    ", we found that , with mc - kln initial conditions , @xmath35 and other inputs , vishnu generally describes the @xmath0-spectra of strange hadron @xmath1 and multi - strange hadrons @xmath2 at some centrality classes , but slightly over - estimates for @xmath3 at chosen centrality classes . in spite of the normalization issues , the vishnu well produces the spectra slopes of these three hadrons at chosen centralities . by comparing the elliptic flow of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in au+au collisions and pb+pb collisions from vishnu model with the star and alice measurements",
    ", we found that the vishnu generally describes the elliptic flow except at semi - peripheral collisions .",
    "the failed descriptions at semi - peripheral collisions is probably due to the non local thermal equilibrium at these collisions .",
    "we also compared the mass ordering of @xmath5 among hadrons @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 from vishnu calculations with the star and alice measurements .",
    "the comparisons showed that the elliptic flow mass ordering among various hadron species is not fully described at both rhic and lhc .",
