    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) has been successful in describing charged hadrons production in elementary collisions .",
    "determining the validity of pqcd in predicting strange particle production in @xmath2collisions is important and new high statistics data from the star experiment may provide a useful tool to do so",
    ". the 2002 @xmath2rhic - run at @xmath0= 200 gev yielded the largest statistics data on strange particles at this energy to date .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles are reconstructed by their secondary vertices in the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "this paper will compare the agreement of the transverse momentum spectra observed for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with leading - order ( pythia ) and nlo pqcd model calculations @xcite .",
    "the data were reconstructed using the large acceptance star experiment at rhic which is described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a total of 10.7 million non - singly diffractive ( nsd ) events were recorded using the star beam - beam counters ( bbc ) as triggers .",
    "the strange particles were identified from their weak decay to charged daughter particles .",
    "the following decay channels and the corresponding anti - particles were analyzed : @xmath3@xmath7 ( b.r .",
    "68.6% ) , @xmath8(b.r .",
    "63.9% ) , @xmath9(b.r .",
    "particle identification of the daughters was achieved by requiring the de / dx to fall within the 3@xmath10-bands of theoretical bethe - bloch parameterizations .",
    "further reduction of the combinatorical background was achieved by applying cuts to select the decay topology from real decays and full analysis details can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "pythia is a leading order pqcd model based on `` lund '' string fragmentation which describes hadronization .",
    "higher order corrections to the parton cross - section can be accounted for by using a phenomenological k - factor .",
    "first comparisons to star data were performed using pythia version 6.220 and results can be seen in figure 1 and were shown at a previous conference @xcite . in january of 2005 , a significantly improved version 6.3 was released by the authors .",
    "this version treats multiple scattering as well as initial and final state showers in a more consistent way by using a @xmath11-ordered algorithm @xcite .",
    "the comparisons of our data to this newer version are also shown in figure [ fig : pythia ] .",
    "they clearly show an overall improvement in the description of the data , however the inclusion of a higher k - factor , here set to 3 , seems necessary to describe the strange and multi - strange baryons .",
    "the k - factor in pythia simply multiplies the hard parton cross - section by a constant k. a discussion of how the k - factor may vary with @xmath0can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "( left ) and @xmath12 ( right ) @xmath11-spectra compared to different nlo calculations .",
    "solid lines are for @xmath13 , dashed lines are for @xmath14 and indicate the factorization scale uncertainty .",
    "data includes only statistical errors . ]",
    "next - to - leading order calculations are similar to pythia in the sense that they also apply the factorization theorem to separate the perturbative from the non - perturbative part of the process .",
    "the perturbative parton cross - sections are analytically calculated using the additional higher order feynman diagrams that were absent in lo .",
    "the non - perturbative part consisting of the proton parton distribution function ( pdf ) and the fragmentation function ( ff ) are parametrized using collider data .",
    "previously , it has been shown that the charged particle and neutral pion spectra at rhic are well described by nlo pqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the fact that the strange baryons require a higher k - factor in the lo calculation seems to indicate that a more precise calculation of the parton cross - section is necessary .",
    "figure [ fig : nlo ] compares recent nlo calculations to strange particle spectra measured by star . for @xmath3 ,",
    "two calculations were obtained , one using kniehl - kramer - ptter ( kkp ) fragmentation functions @xcite , the other using more recent parametrization by albino _",
    "et al . _ ( akk ) @xcite .",
    "both describe the data within the model uncertainties . for @xmath4 ,",
    "calculations by vogelsang _",
    "( wv ) @xcite and by akk were used .",
    "the more recent akk parametrization includes an additional assumption that the shape of the gluon fragmentation function for @xmath4 is similar to that of the proton but suppressed by a factor of 3 .",
    "this factor was derived by using the star data as an additional constraint .",
    "heavy ion collisions at rhic produce a system of deconfined quarks and gluons of much larger volume than @xmath2collisions .",
    "the enhancement of strange particles has been proposed as a signature of such a strongly interacting quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the dependency of the strangeness yields with respect to the created volume of the system has been reported in heavy ion collisions at cern sps ( @xmath0=17 gev ) and studied by statistical models @xcite .",
    "recently star measured the yields for @xmath4 and @xmath5 particles in au+au collisions at @xmath0=200 gev for various collision centralities @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the observed non - linear increase of the yields with @xmath1contradicts the sps measurement and indicates that the strangeness correlation volume may not be well described by @xmath1 .",
    "alternative results by a non - equilibrium statistical model seem to agree better with the star data @xcite .",
