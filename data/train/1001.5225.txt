    "electron - electron correlation in strong laser fields has raised considerable interest for over a decade , in particular in the context of laser - induced nonsequential double and multiple ionization @xcite .",
    "concrete examples are the early measurements of a knee \" in the double ionization yield as a function of the laser - field intensity , which deviates from the predictions of sequential models in orders of magnitude @xcite , and the peaks in the electron momentum distributions in nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) , as functions of the electron components @xmath0 @xmath1 parallel to the laser - field polarization @xcite .",
    "such peaks occur at nonvanishing parallel momenta and can not be explained by a sequential mechanism .    presently , it is an established fact that nsdi occurs due to the inelastic recollision of an electron with its parent ion @xcite . in this recollision ,",
    "the first electron gives part of the kinetic energy it acquired from the driving field to a second electron , which is then freed .",
    "the simplest type of recollision which can lead to this phenomenon is electron - impact ionization .",
    "thereby , the first electron , upon return , provides the second electron with enough energy so that it is able to overcome the second ionization potential of the target in question and reach the continuum .",
    "both electrons leave simultaneously and lead to distributions peaked at nonvanishing momenta , occupying the first and third quadrant of the plane @xmath2@xmath3 spanned by the parallel momentum components .",
    "electron - impact ionization is possibly the most extensively investigated nsdi mechanism @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , until the past few years , it was sufficient to describe key features observed experimentally in the electron momentum distributions .",
    "concrete examples are the peaks near the non - vanishing momenta @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ponderomotive energy , and the recently reported v - shaped structure @xcite , which is a signature of the long - range character of the electron - electron interaction @xcite . moreover , from the theoretical viewpoint , this mechanism is considerably easier to model , as compared to other rescattering processes .",
    "this is particularly true in the context of semi - analytical models , such as the strong - field approximation @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results , however , reveal other rescattering mechanisms apart from electron - impact ionization .",
    "for instance , if the driving - field intensity is below the threshold intensity , the kinetic energy of the recolliding electron is no longer sufficient to make the second electron overcome the ionization potential of the singly ionized core and reach the continuum @xcite . in this intensity range ,",
    "the energy transferred to the core is only enough to raise the second electron to an excited bound state , from which it subsequently tunnels .",
    "this process is known as recollision - excitation - tunneling ionization ( resi ) .",
    "this mechanism is also important for specific targets , such as argon @xcite , even if intensities above the threshold are taken , provided the driving pulse is long enough .    for this specific mechanism ,",
    "the first electron leaves near a crossing of the driving field , whilst the second electron is freed near a field maximum .",
    "the time delay between both electrons suggests that they leave with opposite momenta .",
    "this implies that the second and the fourth quadrant of the @xmath6@xmath7 plane are expected to be populated @xcite .",
    "a population in such regions of the parallel momentum plane has also been observed for nsdi of diatomic molecules , especially if the molecules in question are aligned perpendicular to the laser - field polarization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been recently shown that electron - impact ionization , alone , would not be very useful for retrieving the molecular structure in the experimentally relevant intensity range @xcite .",
    "all these examples suggest that the resi mechanism is becoming increasingly important , in view of the driving field intensities and targets employed .",
    "this mechanism , however , is considerably less understood than electron - impact ionization .",
    "in fact , apart from early results in which only the resi yield has been calculated within a semi - analytical framework @xcite , most existing results are the outcome of computations , either classical @xcite or quantum mechanical @xcite , for which the different rescattering mechanisms can not be easily disentangled .    in previous work @xcite",
    ", we have studied the resi physical mechanism , within the strong - field approximation . in this framework the transition amplitude is written as a multiple integral , with a time - dependent action and slowly - varying prefactors .",
    "this approach has the particular advantage of providing a clear space - time picture of the process in question , in terms of electron trajectories , while retaining features such as quantum - interference effects @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the resi mechanism may be understood as the combination of two processes .",
    "for the first electron , a behavior similar to rescattered above - threshold ionization is present .",
    "the main difference lies on the fact that part of the kinetic energy of the first electron is given to the parent ion .",
    "this leads to a maximal kinetic energy slightly smaller than the high - order ati cutoff @xmath8 the second electron , which is tunnel ionized at a subsequent time , behaves in the same way as in direct above - threshold ionization .",
    "hence , its maximal kinetic energy is given by the direct ati cutoff , i.e. , @xmath9 this allowed one to determine kinematic constraints for the resi mechanism , which lead to distributions which equally occupy the four quadrants of the @xmath10 plane .",
    "for an early derivation of somewhat different kinematic constraints for this mechanism see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the above - stated investigations",
    ", however , we assumed the prefactors in the strong - field approximation amplitude to be constant .",
    "nonetheless , in a more realistic scenario , one should take into account that such prefactors cause a bias in momentum space .",
    "this may lead to electron momentum distributions concentrated on the second and fourth quadrants of the @xmath10 plane .",

    "<S> we perform a detailed analysis of the recollision - excitation - tunneling ( resi ) mechanism in laser - induced nonsequential double ionization ( nsdi ) , in which the first electron , upon return , promotes a second electron to an excited state , from which it subsequently tunnels , based on the strong - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the shapes of the electron momentum distributions carry information about the bound - state with which the first electron collides , the bound state to which the second electron is excited , and the type of electron - electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , one may define a driving - field intensity threshold for the resi physical mechanism . at the threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy of the first electron , upon return , is just sufficient to excite the second electron . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the distributions for helium and argon in the threshold and above - threshold intensity regime . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , we relate our findings to existing experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - momentum distributions encountered are symmetric with respect to all quadrants of the plane spanned by the momentum components parallel to the laser - field polarization , instead of concentrating on only the second and fourth quadrants . </S>"
