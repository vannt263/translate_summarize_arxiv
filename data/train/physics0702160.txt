    "cliques are highly - interconnected subgraphs ( complete graphs ) , and appear dominantly in networks which describe wide - ranging complex systems occurring from the level of cells to society . and , the cliques are actively investigated in recent years because of provisions of important insights to information processing , hierarchical modularity , and community structures .",
    "for instance , in gene regulatory networks , small cliques correspond to the feed - forward loop which is one of the network motifs @xcite .",
    "the motifs play an important role in gene regulation @xcite , and are regarded as building blocks of life .",
    "furthermore , the cliques are a representation for clusters , communities , and groups @xcite because there are edges among persons as nodes if there are friendships , partnerships , and _ etc . _ among the persons in social networks . therefore , the cliques help to detect community structures @xcite in social networks . again , in protein - protein interaction networks , the cliques are powerful tools for understanding evolution of proteins and functional predictions of proteins having unknown function @xcite because proteins which have same functions tend to interact .    motivated by these breakthroughs , recent efforts have taken place to analytically evaluate the abundance of subgraphs , including cliques , based on statistical mechanics @xcite , providing excellent knowledge about the local interaction patterns @xcite and the time evolution of the abundance of subgraphs including cliques @xcite .",
    "these previous works focus on the local information such as the subgraph and clique abundance , and the size of the giant components led by percolation via a class of subgraphs such as the subgraph percolation @xcite , the @xmath2percolation @xcite , and the clique percolations @xcite . in recent years",
    ", however , it has been revealed that real - world networks are constructed by overlapping subgraphs including cliques @xcite ; thus it is important to elucidate global structures in networks consisting of cliques .",
    "for example , dynamics of a high order emerge by the combined network motifs in gene regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "in particular , the several power - law statistical properties have been empirically found in real - world complex networks .",
    "one of the properties is scale - free connectivity @xcite which is characterized by a power - law degree distribution @xmath3 with @xmath4 empirically found @xcite .",
    "the scale - free connectivity means that a few nodes ( hubs ) integrate a great number of nodes and most of the remaining nodes do not .",
    "another of the properties is hierarchical modularity which is characterized by a power - law clustering spectrum @xmath5 with @xmath6 empirically found , and this property suggests a hierarchical structure of the cliques @xcite .",
    "a clustering spectrum is defined as an average clustering coefficient of nodes with degree @xmath7 , where the clustering coefficient means the density of edges among neighbors of a node .",
    "since these properties reflect a global structure of a network , it is significant to clarify relationships between these properties and the global structures of the combined cliques .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the @xmath0-clique network as a powerful tool for understanding global structures of combined highly - interconnected subgraphs .",
    "furthermore , we provide the theoretical predictions for well - known statistical properties of @xmath0-clique networks embedded in a complex network using the degree distribution and the clustering spectrum , and evaluate our theoretical predictions with numerical simulations .",
    "the theoretical predictions are established by applying the statistical method in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we discuss relationships of statistical properties which are observed between several real - world networks and their @xmath0-clique networks .",
    "@xmath0-clique networks are represented as sets of nodes and edges which are contained in @xmath0-node cliques , corresponding to @xmath0-node complete graphs , embedded in an original network .",
    "figure [ fig : c_net ] shows a schematic diagram of @xmath0-clique networks .",

    "the gray nodes and edges are eliminated because the nodes and edges are affiliated with no cliques . following a procedure ,",
    "@xmath0-clique networks are extracted from an original network .",
    "in addition , original networks are equivalent to @xmath8-clique networks in the absence of isolated nodes corresponding to nodes which have no edges . in this paper , we assume that the original networks have no isolated nodes .",
    "we utilize the algorithm based on the network motif detection @xcite to find the cliques although finding clique abundance is computationally intractable ( np - hard ) , enumeration of @xmath0-cliques in a given network can be done in polynomial time if @xmath0 is a constant @xcite .",

    "we consider degree distributions from @xmath0-clique networks @xmath13 .",
    "the degree distribution is defined as the existence probability of nodes with degree @xmath14 which is the number of edges at a node in a @xmath0-clique network .",
    "in addition , @xmath15 denotes the degree distribution @xmath16 from an original network because @xmath17 .",
    "in order to establish a theoretical prediction on the degree distribution of @xmath0-clique networks , we propose an approximation method based on the statistical method in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the clustering spectrum @xmath18 corresponds to the probability that two neighbors of a node with degree @xmath7 ( @xmath19 ) are linked .",
    "first , we consider the probability @xmath20 that an edge on a node with degree @xmath7 is eliminated due to the extraction of @xmath0-clique networks from an original network . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the probability of an edge to be eliminated from a node is independent from the probability of another edge to be eliminated from the same node and the probability of the same edge to be eliminated from a neighbor . this assumption is a suitable approximation in the case of random graphs @xcite because the probability that there is an edge between two nodes is constant .",
    "we show that the approximation is also suitable in the case of arbitrary large - scale graphs ( networks ) for large @xmath7 with numerical simulations . here , we focus on a subset which consists a node with degree @xmath7 , neighboring nodes and edges among these nodes",
    ". then , the edge on the node with degree @xmath7 belongs to @xmath21 @xmath0-cliques which are formed with the probability @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",

    "since the edge is eliminated if the edge is contained in no @xmath0-cliques , from the assimptation of independence , the probability @xmath20 can be written as @xmath25    next , we characterize the conditional probability that the degree shifts from @xmath7 to @xmath14 due to the extraction of @xmath0-clique networks using the probability @xmath20 . the conditional probability can be expressed using the bimodal formula , and we have @xmath26^{k^{(n)}}\\phi_n(k)^{(k - k^{(n)})}. \\label{eq : phi(k|j)}\\ ] ]    the degree distribution from an @xmath0-clique network @xmath13 is proportional to the sum of @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the degree distribution is finally described as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 correspond to the total number of nodes in an original network and in a @xmath0-clique network , respectively . using @xmath16 and @xmath18 ,",

    "[ fig : chg_deg ] and [ fig : phi_k ] .",
    "there are two reasons .",

    "low - degree nodes tend to connect to high - degree nodes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_k ] , the probability that an edge on the high - degree node is eliminated is very small .",

    "another is fluctuation in clustering spectra @xmath18 . in the case of scale - free networks ,",
    "the fluctuation is large for small @xmath7 , and is contrary small for large @xmath7 because of heterogeneous connectivity . and , the probability that a @xmath0-clique is formed is described as @xmath22 .",
