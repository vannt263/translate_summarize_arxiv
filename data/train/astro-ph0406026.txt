    "inflation is the standard paradigm for providing the initial conditions for structure formation and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy generation . in the inflationary picture ,",
    "primordial adiabatic perturbations arise from quantum fluctuations of the _ inflaton _ scalar field which drives the accelerated universe expansion . in the simplest models ,",
    "the inflaton is assumed to have a shallow potential , thereby leading to a slow rolling of this field down its potential .",
    "the flatness of the potential implies that intrinsic non - linear ( hence non - gaussian ) effects during slow - roll inflation are tiny , although non - zero and calculable @xcite . to quantitatively describe the theoretical findings in this framework ,",
    "let us introduce a useful parameterisation of non - gaussianity according to which the primordial gravitational potential @xmath8 is given by a linear gaussian term @xmath9 , plus a quadratic contribution , as follows ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath10 ( up to a constant offset , which only affects the monopole contribution ) , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 sets the strength of non - gaussianity .",
    "the above mentioned calculation of the amount of non - gaussianity during single - field inflation leads to typical values @xmath11 , much too low to be observable in cmb experiments .",
    "however , non - linear gravitational corrections after inflation unavoidably and significantly enhance the non - gaussianity level , leading to values of @xmath12 , almost independent of the detailed inflation dynamics @xcite .",
    "an angular modulation of the quadratic term is also found @xcite , so that @xmath0 should be considered as a kernel in fourier space , rather than a constant .",
    "the resulting effects in harmonic space might be used to search for signatures of inflationary non - gaussianity in the cmb @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , owing to the large values of @xmath13 considered here ( @xmath14 ) we will disregard this complication and assume @xmath0 to be a constant parameter . despite the simplicity of the inflationary paradigm , the mechanism by which adiabatic ( curvature ) perturbations are generated is not yet",
    "fully established . in the _ standard scenario _",
    "associated to single - field models of inflation , the observed density perturbations are due to fluctuations of the inflaton field , driving the accelerated expansion .",
    "an alternative to the standard scenario which has recently gained increasing attention is the _ curvaton _ mechanism @xcite , according to which the final curvature perturbations are produced from an initial isocurvature perturbation associated to the quantum fluctuations of a `` light '' scalar field other than the inflaton , the so - called `` curvaton '' , whose energy density is negligible during inflation . due to a non - adiabatic pressure perturbation arising in multi - fluid systems @xcite curvaton isocurvature perturbations",
    "are transformed into adiabatic ones , when the curvaton decays into radiation much after the end of inflation .",
    "another recently proposed mechanism for the generation of cosmological perturbations is the _ inhomogeneous reheating _",
    "scenario @xcite .",
    "it acts during the reheating stage after inflation if super - horizon spatial fluctuations in the decay rate of the inflaton field are induced during inflation , causing adiabatic perturbations in the final reheating temperature in different regions of the universe .",
    "an important feature of both the curvaton and inhomogeneous reheating scenarios is that , contrary to the single - field slow - roll models , they may naturally lead to high levels of non - gaussianity .",
    "large levels of non - gaussianity are also predicted in a number of theoretical variants of the simplest inflationary models .",
    "first , generalised multi - field models can be constructed in which the final density perturbation is either strongly @xcite or mildly @xcite non - gaussian , and generally characterised by a cross - correlated mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbation modes @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath15 are also predicted in the recently proposed _",
    "ghost - inflation _",
    "picture @xcite , as well as in theories based on a dirac - born - infeld ( dbi)-type lagrangian for the inflaton @xcite .",
    "quite recently , there has been a burst of interest for non - gaussian perturbations of the type of eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "different cmb datasets have been analysed , with a variety of statistical techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) with the aim of constraining @xmath0 . in the last years some authors set increasingly stringent limits on the primordial non - gaussianity level in the cmb fluctuations . using a bispectrum analysis on the cobe dmr data @xcite found @xmath16 .",
    "on the same data , @xcite found @xmath17 using spherical mexican hat wavelets ( smhw ) and @xcite using the maxima data set the limit on primordial non - gaussianity to be @xmath18 .",
    "all these limits are at the 1@xmath19 confidence level .",
    "the most stringent limit to date has been obtained by the _",
    "team @xcite : @xmath20 at @xmath21 cl .",
    "consistent results ( an upper limit of @xmath22 at a @xmath2 confidence level ) have been obtained from the wmap data using smhw @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the minimum value of @xmath13 which can be in principle detected using the angular bispectrum , is around 20 for _ wmap _ , 5 for _ planck _ and 3 for an _ ideal _ experiment , owing to the intrinsic limitations caused by cosmic variance .",
    "alternative strategies , based on the multivariate empirical distribution function of the spherical harmonics of a cmb map , have also been proposed @xcite , or measuring the trispectrum of the cmb @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sect : mapng ] we describe our method to produce the temperature pattern of the cmb in presence of primordial non - gaussianity ; section [ sect : test ] addresses statistical issues to constrain the non - linearity parameter @xmath0 on the basis of wmap data ; finally , in section [ sect : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the non - gaussian cmb maps used in the following analysis have been generated by applying the numerical algorithm introduced by @xcite , hereafter lmm .",
    "here we summarise the various steps that define the whole procedure and refer the reader to that paper for further details .",
    "the starting point of the method is the simulation , directly in real space , of independent complex gaussian variables @xmath23 , with correlation functions @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dirac delta function and @xmath26 is kronecker s delta .    the linear potential multipoles @xmath27 ( here @xmath28 ) having the desired correlation properties , as expressed in terms of the primordial ( i.e. unprocessed by the radiation transfer function ) power - spectrum of the gravitational potential @xmath29 , can be obtained by convolving @xmath23 with suitable filter functions @xmath30 : @xmath31 the filters @xmath30 are defined as ( see lmm ) @xmath32 here @xmath33 are spherical bessel function of order @xmath34 .",
    "notice that @xmath30 can be pre - computed at the beginning of all simulations and then applied in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : filter ] ) .",
    "one more advantage of this approach is that @xmath30 , at fixed @xmath35 , are smooth functions of @xmath36 which differ from zero only in a narrow region around @xmath37 ; as a consequence , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : real_convolution ] ) can be estimated in a fast way by computing @xmath30 in few points .    at this point",
    "the values of the linear potential @xmath38 can be recovered thanks to its expansion in spherical harmonics : @xmath39 the non - gaussian contribution ( modulo @xmath0 ) to the gravitational potential , @xmath40 ( here @xmath41 ) , is obtained directly in spherical coordinates by squaring @xmath42 ; this is then harmonic - transformed by using the healpix package @xcite to get @xmath43 .",
    "finally , the linear and non - linear contributions to the total cmb multipoles @xmath44 are obtained by convolving each term with the real - space radiation transfer function @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( see lmm , for the formal derivation ) , @xmath47 notice that also the quantities @xmath45 , which have been numerically estimated by using a modification of the cmbfast code @xcite can be pre - computed and stored for all the simulations of a given model .    in @xcite a different approach to produce non - gaussian maps was adopted .",
    "their starting point is the generation on a fourier - space grid of a gaussian field , which is then inverse - fourier transformed and squared to get the non - gaussian part of the gravitational potential in real space .",
    "the successive steps involve interpolation on a spherical grid , harmonic transforms and convolution with @xmath45 , to obtain the gaussian and non - gaussian cmb multipole coefficients .",
    "in this section , we will estimate @xmath0 from the wmap data using two different approaches .",
    "the estimation procedures will be calibrated using non - gaussian maps produced by the method described above .",
    "we have replicated the method applied in @xcite ( hereafter mw ) in order to check that the estimates using non - gaussian maps generated with two different methods , give consistent results .",
    "we also introduce a new estimator of @xmath0 based on the local curvature properties of the cmb fluctuation field . finally , we observe that the estimates of @xmath0 from the two methods are approximately uncorrelated ; therefore we introduce a combined estimator which reduces the error bars by a factor of about @xmath48 .",
    "the local curvature test has been used in the flat limit to test the presence of non - gaussianity due to cosmic strings @xcite , and the extension to the spherical case @xcite , has been used to verify the asymmetries in the wmap data . in this section",
    "we will test the power of the local curvature test to detect primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "first we review the method .",
    "+ we consider a cmb temperature map @xmath49 normalised with its standard deviation @xmath19 : @xmath50 the hessian of this map can be written as @xmath51 where the comma denotes the ordinary derivative and the semicolon covariant derivative . in order to evaluate the derivatives it is convenient to go to harmonic - space : @xmath52 and to use the recurrence relations @xcite : @xmath53 twice to obtain the hessian values in every point of the map , as suggested in @xcite . the presence of noise may render the derivatives unstable , but we have checked that the results in this paper do not change significantly when smoothing the map before performing the derivatives .",
    "the points of the renormalised map can be classified as :    * _ hills _ where the eigenvalues of the hessian are both positive , * _ lakes _ where the eigenvalues of the hessian are both negative , * _ saddles _ where the eigenvalues have opposite sign .",
    "we calculate the proportions of hills , lakes and saddles above a certain level @xmath54 in the normalised map . in this way",
    ", we obtain three functions of @xmath54 which in the gaussian case have a known functional form @xcite .",
    "deviations of these functions from this gaussian expectation value can be used to detect non - gaussianity .    in order to constrain the @xmath0",
    "parameter our procedure is as follows :    * we generate a set of primordial non - gaussian maps with the method described in section [ sect : mapng ] with the wmap best fit power spectrum and different @xmath0 ; * we convolve with a beam and add noise corresponding to the given experiment ; * we apply the _ kp0 _ galaxy and point source mask ; * we degrade the maps to the resolution of _ nside _",
    "= 256 where the derivatives are performed ; * we count the densities of hills , lakes and saddles for each map and each level @xmath54 with an extended mask to avoid the instabilities of the derivatives close to the boundaries of _ kp0 _",
    "( for details of the extensions , see @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", we obtain the form of the hill , lake and saddle densities as a function of @xmath0 ; * we repeat the last three points for the data of the given experiment . * for each simulation as well as for the data , we construct a @xmath55 as follows @xmath56 where @xmath57 $ ] , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the hill and lake densities and @xmath60 are the threshold values used , given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the maximum threshold was determined in such a way as to obtain sufficient statistics for the lake proportions which go to zero at high thresholds .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath63 with elements @xmath64 is evaluated on the basis of 1000 gaussian simulations .",
    "the distribution of the hill and lake densities at each threshold has been found to be close to gaussian , justifying the above form of the @xmath55 . *",
    "the estimate of @xmath0 is obtained for each simulation and for the data by minimising this @xmath55 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "* bayesian error bars are derived by constructing the likelihood @xmath65 . integrating this likelihood with respect to the parameter",
    ", we obtain the approximate bayesian `` credible regions '' ( see section [ sect : stati ] ) . *",
    "the frequentist error bars are derived by the histogram of the estimates @xmath66 from simulations and defining the @xmath67 and @xmath2 levels as the limits within which @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the estimates fall .",
    "note that we will perform the estimates ( 1 ) using only the diagonal part of the covariance matrix and ( 2 ) including the full covariance matrix .",
    "we will later show that this makes a huge difference when considering the error bars , and that care has to be taken when approximating the covariance matrix to be diagonal .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : hillfnl ] , where we can see the effect for the different values of @xmath0 on the hill density .",
    "we applied this procedure to the publicly available wmap data .",
    "we co - added the ( foregrounds subtracted ) maps from the three wmap frequency channels q , u and w following the procedure in @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : chi2data ] we show the @xmath70 for the data around its minimum in the two cases , with and without the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix . when using only the diagonal parts of the covariance matrix we estimate @xmath71 with a @xmath68 and @xmath69 credible region equal to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , in good agreement with previously released estimates @xcite .",
    "we also include proper ( frequentist ) confidence intervals , which turn out to be @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the relationship between the two approaches is discussed in subsection [ sect : stati ] .",
    "when including the full covariance matrix , we estimate @xmath76 with a @xmath68 and @xmath69 approximate credible region equal to @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , while the frequentist constraints turn out to be @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we observe that when not including the full covariance matrix , there is a huge difference in error bars between the bayesian / frequentist approaches . including the full matrix ,",
    "this difference is smaller but persists .",
    "the much bigger frequentist error bars can be explained as follows : when assuming that the thresholds are uncorrelated , huge deviations from the expected value at many thresholds provide strong evidence against the model to be tested . on the other hand , taking into account the fact that the thresholds are highly correlated , the evidence becomes weaker and the expected model can still be consistent with the observations .",
    "note further that bayesian error bars tend to be lower than in the frequentist case in the above estimates from the wmap data ; the same phenomenon occurs in simulated maps .",
    "+ as a final remark , we note that equation ( [ eq : chicur ] ) can be exploited to implement a goodness - of - fit test for our specification of noise and foreground features .",
    "more precisely , we compared the best fit value @xmath81 obtained for the wmap data with @xmath82 from 200 monte carlo simulations of non - gaussian cmb maps with @xmath83 .",
    "when using the diagonal covariance matrix , the observed value corresponds to the @xmath84 quantile , thereby suggesting good agreement between wmap data and our simulated models .",
    "when we adopt the full covariance matrix , the observed value is smaller than @xmath85 of the simulations , that is , the local curvature statistics on wmap data are closer to their expected values than the great majority of simulated maps .",
    "note however that we are performing four similar tests on the data ( local curvature , wavelets with and without covariance matrix ) and therefore a @xmath85 deviation from simulations is not significant .",
    "wavelets are a very flexible tool used in connection with cmb data for denoising @xcite , extracting point sources @xcite , and detecting non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "to test the consistency of our maps of primordial non - gaussian models with those of @xcite we have repeated the method for estimating @xmath0 described in mw .",
    "the basics steps for the test are the following ( for more details , see mw ) :    * we generate a set of primordial non - gaussian maps with the method described in section [ sect : mapng ] with the wmap best fit power spectrum and different @xmath0 ; * we add noise and convolve with a beam corresponding to the given experiment ; * we apply the _ kp0 _ galactic cut , leaving the point sources unmasked ; * we degrade the maps to the resolution of _ nside _ = 256 ; * we obtain the wavelet coefficients by convolving each map with the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) given by : @xmath86 ^ 2 \\left[2-\\left(\\frac{y}{r}\\right)^2e^{-y^2/2r^2}\\right],\\ ] ] using the scales @xmath87 given in mw ( 14 , 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 750 , 900 , 1050 arcmin ) ; * we use only the coefficients outside an extended _ kp0 _ mask ( for details of the extensions , see @xcite and mw ) to obtain the skewness as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the result is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : hillfnl ] ; * we finally repeat the last three steps for the data of the given experiment . * for each simulation as well as for the data , we construct a @xmath55 as follows @xmath88 where the elements of the vector @xmath89 are @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the skewness of the wavelet coefficients on scale @xmath92 . the covariance matrix @xmath63 with elements @xmath64",
    "is evaluated on the basis of 1000 gaussian simulations .",
    "the distribution of the skewness at each scale is close to gaussian , justifying the above form of the @xmath55 .",
    "* for each simulations and for the data we estimate @xmath0 by minimising this @xmath55 with respect to the parameter .",
    "* bayesian error bars are found by constructing the likelihood @xmath65 . integrating this likelihood with respect to the parameter",
    ", we obtain the approximate bayesian credible regions ( see section [ sect : stati ] ) . *",
    "the frequentist error bars are derived by the histogram of the estimates @xmath66 from simulations and defining the @xmath67 and @xmath2 levels as the limits within which @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the estimates fall .",
    "again , the test was performed on the co - added ( foreground cleaned ) q+v+w wmap map .",
    "the plot of the @xmath55 for the data is shown in figure  [ fig : chi2data ] .",
    "we estimate the bayesian credible region , considering only the diagonal part of the covariance matrix ( the results presented in mw were obtained using the same approximation ) , for @xmath0 to be @xmath93 at the 1@xmath19 level and @xmath94 at the 2@xmath19 level , in agreement with the values derived in mw ( see again the discussion in section [ sect : stati ] ) . considering the full covariance matrix",
    ", we estimate @xmath0 to be @xmath95 at the 1@xmath19 level and @xmath96 at the 2@xmath19 level as for the curvature , we have also calculated the frequentist confidence intervals which in the first case turn out to be quite larger , @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively , while considering the full covariance matrix we find for the error bars on @xmath0 @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "again the bayesian credible regions are generally smaller than the frequentist confidence levels , but considering the full covariance matrix , the difference is reduced .",
    "note further that the bayesian credible regions are slightly underestimated when approximating the covariance matrix to be diagonal .",
    "as before , we also implemented a goodness - of - fit test based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : chiwav ] ) ; we found that the values on the wmap data corresponds to the @xmath101 and @xmath102 quantile obtained from 200 simulations with @xmath103 when using the diagonal and full covariance matrices , respectively .",
    "again , this suggests that our specification of noise and foreground masks provides a reasonable approximation to the experimental settings of wmap .",
    "in this section we apply the combined procedure introduced in @xcite to improve the constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "first of all , we estimated the correlation between the two estimators @xmath104 and @xmath105 by 200 monte carlo simulations and found @xmath106 suggesting that the correlation between the estimators is less than @xmath107 .",
    "then , we can lower the error bars on @xmath0 by combining the two statistics .",
    "more precisely , we use the estimates obtained with the full covariance matrix and we evaluate the frequentist confidence intervals on the following statistic : @xmath108 using the combined test on the wmap data , we estimate @xmath109 , with the constrains at @xmath7 and @xmath2 levels of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .      in this subsection",
    "we present a brief discussion on the evaluation of ( frequentist ) confidence intervals and ( bayesian ) credible regions on @xmath0 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath112 our estimate of the non - linearity parameter obtained by minimising eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chicur ] ) and ( [ eq : chiwav ] ) : also , let us denote by @xmath113 the likelihood function .",
    "as well known , an @xmath114-level confidence interval for @xmath0 based upon the observation @xmath112 is the set of all values @xmath0 such that @xmath115 note that the integral is taken with respect to the estimate @xmath116 that is , we are viewing @xmath117 as the probability density of our estimator . in words ,",
    "we include in the confidence interval all the values @xmath0 such that the probability to get an estimated parameter as @xmath112 or further away is at least as large as @xmath118 .",
    "more clearly , a value is included provided it does not entail that _ observing what we observed _ is less probable than @xmath118 . of course , in the special case where the distribution of @xmath116 is gaussian with mean @xmath0 and variance @xmath119 which does not depend on @xmath0 ( or , in general , is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath120 )",
    ", we have @xmath121 by the symmetry of the previous expression with respect to @xmath122 .",
    "this justifies the common practice to derive confidence intervals by integrating the likelihood . rigorously speaking , however ,",
    "this is no longer justified if the integrand is not symmetric with respect to an exchange of @xmath0 with @xmath116 ( for instance if @xmath19 is not constant with respect to @xmath0 ) .",
    "one may then try to justify the integration of the likelihood by a bayesian viewpoint , by assuming a flat prior and viewing @xmath123 as a posterior density function .",
    "the resulting set , however , should not be labelled as confidence interval ( which is a frequentist concept ) : it is a bayesian credible region , which will depend in general on the choice of the prior .",
    "it is occasionally stated that this dependence is overcome by the choice of a flat prior .",
    "the latter is claimed to be non - informative by definition : indeed , no physicist would consider a priori equally likely that @xmath0 lies in @xmath124 $ ] rather than it is in @xmath125 $ ] ( say ) ; thus a flat prior , although unphysical , is usually justified as a _ panacea _ to get objective results .",
    "this argument is to some extent misleading , though , as it can be shown by standard counterexamples .",
    "take for instance eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) , and assume for brevity s sake that @xmath126 ( otherwise duplicate our argument by symmetry )",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath127 that is @xmath128 . of course",
    ", from the physical point of view there is no reason to prefer the alternative specification in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) to ( [ 1bis ] ) .",
    "now let us assume we impose a `` non - informative '' ( flat ) prior on @xmath129 , the posterior probability becomes @xmath130 and the credible sets are thus obviously affected , although we are working with exactly the same model as before and we are claiming to have used no a priori information . in short , flat priors are simply shifting the choice from the form of the prior probability to the form of the statistical parametrisation ; the latter , moreover , is not due to physical considerations , but simply to computational convenience .    with this in mind , we will now use @xmath120 estimated from 200 simulations ( with the experimental settings used above ) to investigate whether the distribution of @xmath120 as a function of the model @xmath0 is symmetric with respect to an exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath120 . in figures  ( [ fig : contcur ] ) , ( [ fig : contcurcov ] ) we show a contour plot of this function for the curvature and wavelet test , respectively . when not considering the full covariance matrix , this function is markedly skewed for the wavelet test , but even more so for the curvature test ( see fig . [",
    "fig : contcur ] ) .",
    "this may explain the big difference between the confidence intervals and bayesian credible regions for the wavelets and the even bigger difference for the curvature test when correlations are neglected . on the other hand , when correlations are properly taken into account , the model fit is better and the function becomes considerably more symmetric ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : contcurcov ] ) .",
    "this is also reflected in the fact that the difference between bayesian and frequentist error bars is markedly reduced in this case .",
    "in this paper we have used simulated cmb maps of primordial non - gaussian models , generated with the algorithm described in @xcite to estimate the non - linear coupling parameter @xmath0 from the wmap data .",
    "as all other estimates of @xmath0 in the literature have been based on non - gaussian cmb maps generated by a different approach @xcite , one of the aims of this paper was to check whether a different way of generating cmb maps with the same kind of primordial non - gaussianity gives a consistent estimate of @xmath0 . in order to perform a direct test of consistency",
    ", we applied the estimator of @xmath0 using smhw presented in @xcite on the wmap data . when neglecting the scale - scale correlations , we find that our estimate of @xmath0 is in full agreement with theirs and thus that the two ways of generating primordial non - gaussian maps give fully consistent results .",
    "we have also presented a new method to estimate @xmath0 based on the local curvature of the cmb fluctuation field .",
    "our estimate of @xmath0 with this method on the wmap data is consistent with estimates of @xmath0 using other approaches .",
    "moreover , we point out the importance of including the full covariance matrix in the @xmath55 when estimating @xmath0 with these two methods .",
    "we also discuss the difference between frequentist confidence intervals and bayesian credible regions on the estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the difference between these two methods for finding error bars can be huge when not including the full covariance matrix , particularly for the curvature estimator where correlations between thresholds are important . for the wmap data ,",
    "the bayesian credible region expands whereas the frequentist confidence intervals shrink when taking into account correlations in the covariance matrix .",
    "we find further that the bayesian credible regions are in general smaller than the frequentist confidence intervals .",
