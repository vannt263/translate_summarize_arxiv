    "given an initial quantum state @xmath0 , that may be either a pure state or a density matrix , and assuming factorizability of the total hilbert space to which it belongs , @xmath1 , we first define the reduced density matrix @xmath2 as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the complementary of @xmath5 in @xmath6 .",
    "the entanglement entropy ( ee ) is the von neumann entropy of @xmath2 : @xmath7 it is easy to show that @xmath8 corresponds to some measure of the entanglement between degrees of freedom inside @xmath5 and degrees of freedom outside , hence the name .    a simple formula exists for the holographic computation of ee , if factorizability of the total hilbert space is induced by dividing the space ( or more covariantly a space - like surface ) into non intersecting subspaces @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , each one defining the corresponding hilbert space @xmath5 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath12 for the corresponding local degrees of freedom , and if an holographic description of the quantum mechanical theory is possible in terms of einstein gravity , with @xmath0 represented by a classical metric solution .",
    "ryu and takayanagi for the static case at fixed boundary time @xcite , and later hubeny , rangamani and takayanagi ( hrt ) for the covariant generalization @xcite , proposed the following : @xmath15 in the above equation @xmath16 is the newton constant in the gravitational @xmath17 dimensional theory , and @xmath18 is the area of the extremal codimension two space - like surface @xmath19 homologous to @xmath9 and such that , at the boundary of the gravitational manifold , @xmath20 .",
    "if the gravitational geometry is static , the above formula simplifies in the euclidean signature by using a minimal surface . ) and the corresponding surface @xmath19 as ryu - takayanagi or hrt depending if used for respectively static spacetimes in euclidean signature or generically lorentzian time dependent . ] in the static case a proof for the ryu - takayanagi formula was provided by @xcite , but still lacks for the time dependent covariant case .",
    "nonetheless we will assume , throughout the paper , that ( [ ryutak ] ) is valid .",
    "one interesting thing about holography , and in particular when dealing with formulas like ( [ ryutak ] ) , is the interplay between quantum mechanics and classical general relativity ; working with ee we can compare properties obeyed by @xmath8 , deeply related to entanglement at the very foundations of quantum mechanics , with measures of areas of surfaces probing classical geometries of the dual space - time !",
    "the literature somehow related to this is vast , and covers the question of what quantum conditions ( inequalities ) can be derived from holography @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the opposite problem of what gravitational restrictions are imposed from quantum inequalities @xcite and @xcite , studies the appearance of gravity equations of motions and dynamics from ee @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , and the reverse @xcite and @xcite , and even reconstructs the metric from boundary ee data @xcite .",
    "it is well known that ee satisfies a series of inequalities , among which the two most restricting go under the name of strong subadditivity . given three hilbert spaces that factorize the total one @xmath1 , the two inequalities read :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 refers to the ee computed by using the reduced density matrix living on the product of the two hilbert spaces @xmath23 , and so on . if factorizability can be achieved by considering spacial non intersecting regions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , then the same result holds for the corresponding ees and @xmath22 is the ee corresponding to the spatial region @xmath24 and so on . note that these two equations are equivalent , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "even if quantum mechanical proofs of ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ( [ ssa2 ] ) exist , see for example @xcite , it is a nontrivial question to ask if the ee computed holographically by the ryu - takayanagi ( or covariantly hrt ) formula satisfies them or not . why the question is nontrivial is due to three possible pitfalls .",
    "the first problem is the non induced factorizability of the total hilbert space from dividing the physical space into subregions .",
    "it is well known for example for gauge theories , where gauge invariance at the boundary between a region @xmath9 and its complementary @xmath25 does not allow a factorization of the total hilbert space of physical gauge invariant states into @xmath5 and @xmath26 . or , said in another way , the degrees of freedom of gauge theories are not point - like but rather nonlocal ( wilson loops ) , and consequently when considering a certain region of space they do not construct a physical ( gauge invariant ) hilbert space .",
    "the literature is wide , see for example the lists of papers @xcite for a more theoretical approach and @xcite for attempts to formulate a lattice definition . while a formulation of ee may still be possible for gauge theories , for example by appropriately enlarging the hilbert space or by correctly defining the path integral replica trick , whenever the total hilbert space does not factorize we are in general not guaranteed that inequalities like ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ( [ ssa2 ] ) hold .",
    "in fact this argument may apply even to ee computed non holographically , as long as the reduced density matrices are defined with respect to a certain region of space .",
    "a pure cft example of strong subadditivity violation without passing through the holographic description , but rather considering ee computed using the replica trick in the cft , will be provided in section [ cft ] . there",
    "we will consider two dimensional cfts with lorentz anomaly , by using the results of @xcite where it was noted that the ee , as expected , is not lorentz invariant .",
    "this means that the ee transforms under boosts and , if these are applied to space regions entering inequalities ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ( [ ssa2 ] ) , the two sides can change so that to possibly lead to a violation .",
    "said otherwise , strong subadditivity may be respected in some fixed reference frame in which the quantization of the theory has been implemented , but if we consider hilbert spaces corresponding to space regions that have been differently boosted with respect to this original frame , and the theory has a lorentz anomaly , violation can occur .",
    "this is the second problem and again it applies even without passing through an holographic computation . on the issue of ee and its relation to anomalies",
    "see also the recent papers @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the third problem arises only in holographic ee : while einstein s equations can be solved using any energy momentum tensor as a source , it is not guaranteed that any choice is actually physically meaningful . to constrain the energy momentum tensor various energy conditions",
    "have been proposed , see for example @xcite for a review of these conditions and of their effects . without imposing any condition",
    "it is not improbable that the resulting classical geometry may not be dual to same actual physical quantum system .",
    "in particular we are no longer guaranteed on the validity of any quantum mechanically - derived inequality .",
    "we will discuss this further in the next section in relationship with the proof of the equivalence between ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ( [ ssa2 ] ) , and in the conclusions .",
    "note that , if any of the above pitfalls affects the proof of either ( [ ssa1 ] ) or ( [ ssa2 ] ) , that is we have violation of only one of the two inequalities , then similar reasons should necessary lead to the violation of the proof for the equivalence between ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ( [ ssa2 ] ) that we will discuss in the next section .    extremely simple holographic proofs of ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ( [ ssa2 ] ) exist when the three connected adjacent regions are at the same constant boundary time ( or its boosted version ) and the bulk geometry is static , somehow in contrast with the complication of the standard quantum mechanical proofs",
    ". however the argument fails when more generic configurations of regions and/or time dependent backgrounds are considered . because of this some works considered dropping one or both of these restrictions in order to check if the strong subadditivity inequalities were still satisfied or not , and if some conditions should be eventually applied to the geometry in order to enforce their validity . in particular @xcite and @xcite considered static backgrounds with generic space - like boundary regions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and found that requiring ( [ ssa2 ] ) leads to a integrated version of the null curvature condition ( ncc ) ( [ intncc ] ) .",
    "further a simple time dependent geometry , asymptotically ads in 2 + 1 dimensions which is the vaidya metric was used by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; depending on the choice of a sign the vaidya geometry may be selected to satisfy or not the local ncc ( [ ncc ] ) , and what was found is that the ncc is a sufficient requirement to respect ( [ ssa2 ] ) , while ( [ ssa1 ] ) is always satisfied .",
    "finally a proof for ( [ ssa2 ] ) was provided by @xcite for dual geometries satisfying the ncc and generic connected adjacent space - like intervals .",
    "the main goals of this paper are three .",
    "first of all to review in an organized way the present understanding of strong subadditivity inequalities in holographic theories and their connection with energy conditions .",
    "second to enlighten the geometrical part of the above problem studying what is the holographic counterpart of the violation of strong subadditivity and the role of energy conditions .",
    "third to fill some gaps in the literature and discuss further discoveries as , notably , the violation of ( [ ssa2 ] ) by two dimensional cfts with lorentz anomaly , the development of time - like distances between geodesics entering ( [ ssa2 ] ) whenever the inequality does not hold and some new proofs along the way .    the paper is organized by discussing strong subadditivity in set - ups of crescent complication , always in 2 + 1 dimensions in the bulk ( although some results may be generalized ) and boundary regions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 chosen to be adjacent , starting with static backgrounds with collinear intervals then moving to generic space - like configurations and finally to time dependent geometries , discussing both the purely quantum mechanical problem and its holographic version .",
    "two appendices contain respectively the generic result and proof of what configurations for the boundary intervals @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 create the strongest bound on ee by strong subadditivity , and various computations for vaidya metric that will be used in the last sections as specific examples for the more generic discussion .",
    "we begin with the purely quantum mechanical proof of the equivalence between the two strong subadditivity inequalities , ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ( [ ssa2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "let us introduce an auxiliary hilbert space @xmath27 such that partial tracing some pure state @xmath28 over it , reproduces the reduced density matrix @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath30 then @xmath31 and we can convert ( [ ssa1 ] ) into ( [ ssa2 ] ) @xmath32 a discussion on why this proof may fail in certain circumstances can be found inside @xcite .",
    "the argument is that , purely quantum mechanically we are always guaranteed to find @xmath27 .",
    "if the theory has zero entropy it is just the complementary of @xmath33 inside the total hilbert space , @xmath34 , while if the theory is described by some density matrix it may not be the hilbert space of degrees of freedom of the theory itself .",
    "still the proof applies if we limit ourselves to ee computed quantum mechanically and not holographically .",
    "the only pitfall in this case is the already discussed issue of factorizability of the total hilbert space that we will not repeat .",
    "holographically instead , if the bulk theory contains a black hole , the total entropy of the system in non zero and the boundary theory is not in a pure state but rather in a thermal density matrix .",
    "the proof then holds for the holographic entanglement entropy only if the bulk actually describes some quantum system and we can thus use the above derivation .",
    "if the bulk is sufficiently unphysical we may instead have troubles ; this is in fact just another way of recasting the argument that generic bulk geometries may not be dual to quantum mechanical systems , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "finally we will soon see a purely cft violation of ( [ ssa2 ] ) in the following sections while preserving ( [ ssa1 ] ) for two dimensional theories with lorentz anomaly , so the above proof should break down in this case for analogous reasons .",
    "the argument here is as in the introduction , and the problem arises when we consider differently boosted space regions starting from the reference frame that was used to quantize the theory and in which strong subadditivity holds ; lorentz anomaly implies that all the expressions written in the original frame will transform and relationships between them are no longer guaranteed to hold .",
    "similarly simple proofs do not exist for the two strong subadditivity inequalities , that from now on we will name ssa1 for ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ssa2 for ( [ ssa2 ] ) , that instead require some amount of work to be verified .",
    "simplicity is restored when we consider their holographic description as ryu - takayanagi surfaces when considering collinear boundary intervals in static spacetimes .    for the rest of the paper ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , the 2 + 1 dimensional bulk theories will be in the euclidean signature when static , and lorentzian when dynamic .",
    "the easiest case is that of static geometry with the three boundary intervals collinear , either at fixed time or belonging to a straight space - like line ; also we assume lorentz invariance .",
    "it is quite surprising that the proof for both ( [ ssa1 ] ) and ( [ ssa2 ] ) just amounts to look at picture [ figuraspc ] .",
    "the one dimensional minimal surfaces @xmath35 and @xmath36 intersect at the point p , thus defining @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; due to the minimality of @xmath19 and @xmath41 , it is immediate the result @xmath42 and @xmath43 , proving ( [ ssa1 ] ) .",
    "analogously we can obtain ( [ ssa2 ] ) from @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the above proofs unfortunately only apply to the case described . if @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 for example are not collinear , and/or if the geometry is time dependent so that the curves bend in the time direction , then we will not generically have any intersection between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "further , the time dependent case brings one additional complication as the hrt surfaces are in this case extremals , so even if we could actually find a way to compare areas , we would not be able to write down inequalities as if minimal surfaces were involved .",
    "when lorentz invariance is preserved the ee is just a function of the proper length of the interval @xmath46 ; ssa1 implies monotonicity for the function @xmath46 while for collinear intervals ssa2 leads instead to concavity .",
    "monotonicity is immediately proven by considering the special case of collinear intervals with proper lengths @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 , then ( [ ssa1 ] ) just gives @xmath49 in fact it is also obviously true the opposite , that monotonicity implies ssa1 and the two conditions are equivalent .",
    "when considering ee computed holographically by the area of ryu - takayanagi surfaces , monotonicity can in fact be obtained directly without passing through ssa1 , by showing that the proper length of a minimal surface ( or more generally any curve that minimize some fixed bulk functional ) is monotonically increasing as a function of the proper length of the boundary interval to which it is attached .",
    "concavity is just barely more complicated to derive from ssa2 , see for example @xcite for the proof of the equivalence between concavity and ssa2 for collinear intervals .",
    "again this property can be obtained directly , as for monotonicity , when dealing with the holographic minimal surfaces @xmath50 , whenever we vary the proper length @xmath51 of the boundary interval along the fixed space - like direction determined by the boundary end points .",
    "this is obtained with a slightly different construction then the one of figure [ figuraspc ] ; let us consider a boundary straight space - like line and pick @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) minimal curves ending on intervals of length @xmath54 that belongs to such line , displaced by a distance @xmath55 , as in figure [ figuramonmin ] ( @xmath51 does not need to be an integer multiple of @xmath55 ) .",
    "we have that the proper length of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , obeys the inequality : @xmath58 which is proven as in figure [ figuramonmin ] , just noticing that the black curve has necessarily higher or equal proper length ( or whatever functional we are minimizing ) than @xmath59 , while each of the @xmath60 unions of a blue and a red arc is bigger than the proper length of what would be the corresponding minimal curve @xmath50 . in the limit of @xmath61 , while keeping @xmath62 at some finite value , the above formula reads @xmath63 that is just concavity for @xmath64 .",
    "the case of non collinear intervals is more interesting . in appendix",
    "[ a ] it is shown that , as a function of the slopes of the three intervals @xmath65 , the stricter bound on the ee @xmath66 from ssa1 comes from the case @xmath67 , and from ssa2 @xmath68 or @xmath69 ( or their parity transformed counterparts ) .",
    "let us show what conditions on @xmath66 the strong subadditivity inequalities corresponds to for these configurations .",
    "the ssa2 inequality has already been considered in @xcite for a configuration slightly less general then the one we are using , and we will follow a similar procedure . for reference for the parameterization consider the first picture of figure [ figuravssa ] ( the situation with @xmath69 is completely analogous ) ; defining @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and a function @xmath74 such that @xmath75 , by computing the proper lengths for the intervals appearing in ssa2 , ( [ ssa2 ] ) reads for this case @xmath76 as we always have @xmath77 ( as explained in figure [ figuravssa ] caption ) and obviously @xmath78 , the above inequality is just concavity for @xmath79 , so @xmath80 that is stronger than simple concavity for @xmath66 , due to the monotonicity required from ssa1 : @xmath81 .    we can now follow a similar path for ssa1 applied to the configuration with slopes @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , as the interval b appears only on the bigger side of the inequality , an even stronger bound can be obtained by further minimizing the proper lengths of @xmath24 and @xmath82 by considering an infinitesimal space coordinate length @xmath83 .",
    "parameterizing this configuration as in appendix [ a ] , and defining @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( and correspondingly for @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 , we obtain the following result from ( [ ssa1 ] ) ( using @xmath83 to rewrite @xmath88 ) @xmath89 which is just monotonicity for @xmath90 .",
    "however in this case , as a first derivative is involved , the condition implies nothing more than the usual monotonicity for @xmath66 : @xmath91 that ( [ con2 ] ) becomes stricter than concavity for non collinear intervals while ( [ con1 ] ) remains the usual monotonicity will soon have its counterpart : in various cases , holographically and not , for generic adjacent interval configurations ee will still satisfy ssa1 while the stricter ssa2 will be generically violated .",
    "in the holographic description we will see as respecting ssa2 shall require certain geometrical conditions to be satisfied by the background .      still studying static bulk geometries , with all the nice properties listed in the previous sections but this time in the lorentz signature , let us see what happens in the bulk when considering geodesics bounded to non collinear adjacent intervals , as for instance in figure [ figuraspnc ] .",
    "the first clear issue is that geodesics ending on @xmath24 and @xmath82 do not generically intersect , and consequently try to prove ssa1 and ssa2 as in figure [ figuraspc ] does not work .",
    "ssa1 however has an alternative proof derivable from the simple relation , @xcite and @xcite : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the conformal scale factor of asymptotically ads metrics , reached by the geodesics at its vertex ( coordinates chosen so that we have large @xmath94 when close to the boundary ) . as it will be useful later ,",
    "let us review briefly the derivation of ( [ r0 ] ) , following @xcite with some modification .",
    "the assumptions are a conformal two dimensional boundary minkowski metric and translation invariance along a boundary space - like direction with associated killing vector @xmath95 .",
    "the geodesic extremizes the action @xmath96 where the interval @xmath97 is taken to be at fixed boundary time @xmath98 .",
    "we vary only the position of the final end point `` f '' by a purely spatial translation @xmath99 .",
    "the variation of the action is just the boundary term @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "then @xmath102 as this quantity is conserved along all the geodesic we can evaluate it at its vertex , where @xmath103 simplifies by writing @xmath104 .",
    "a brief computation leads to @xmath105 this equation is in fact true with or without time translation invariance .",
    "if time translation is a symmetry of the bulk , we can further boost the above equation ( [ r0st ] ) to obtain ( [ r0 ] ) .",
    "the important point here is that @xmath106 always , and thus @xmath66 is monotonically increasing .",
    "one may then try to use this formula to check ( [ con2 ] ) by exploiting the dependence @xmath107 ; the result obtained by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is that ssa2 in its stronger bound ( [ con2 ] ) is equivalent to the condition on the bulk geometry @xmath108 where @xmath56 is our geodesic ending on the interval of proper length @xmath51 and @xmath109 is a null vector perpendicular to @xmath95 .",
    ", whenever einstein s equations are holding . ] our goal is to find a more geometrically transparent proof for the emergence of ( [ intncc ] ) , enhancing the difference between collinear and non collinear intervals and the role of @xmath110 , where the original derivation uses a metric ansatz and einstein s equation to show the equivalence between the explicit formulae for ( [ intncc ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) .     and",
    "its intersection @xmath111 with the ( not shown ) achronal slice.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    so let us start from figure [ figuraspnc ] ; the first issue to solve is that the two curves @xmath35 and @xmath36 do not generically intersect .",
    "let us then shoot out from @xmath35 ( that in our example has been chosen to be nowhere in the past of @xmath36 , if otherwise inverting the roles ) a congruence of null geodesics in the past boundary direction , that is then a codimension one surface @xmath112 .",
    "given translation invariance in the boundary space direction , this null geodesics are chosen to be perpendicular to the corresponding killing vector , this in order to ensure always intersection between @xmath112 and @xmath36 at a point @xmath113 .",
    "now consider any achronal slice ( with points either space - like or null separated ) that contains both the boundary interval @xmath24 and the point @xmath113 , and intersects @xmath112 along some curve ; this curve goes from the left end point of @xmath9 to @xmath113 , lets call this piece @xmath37 , and continues from @xmath113 to the right end point of @xmath10 , that we call @xmath38 as shown in figure [ figuraspnc ] .",
    "the point @xmath113 also splits up @xmath36 into @xmath39 to the left and @xmath40 to the right .",
    "here enters the raychaudhuri equation @xmath114 where , applied to our case , @xmath115 is the affine parameter along @xmath109 , @xmath116 is the shear and @xmath117 represents the variation of the line element of @xmath35 along @xmath115 , divided by the line element itself . as @xmath35 is a geodesic , @xmath118 on it ; then , as on the right hand side of ( [ ray ] ) all the quantities are negative definite but @xmath110 , the total proper length of @xmath35 decreases along @xmath115 if the integral of @xmath110 on @xmath35 is higher or equal then zero , which is just the integrated ncc condition ( [ intncc ] ) . , but also on all the evolution curves created along the flow by @xmath115 .",
    "however we can require only the integral on @xmath56 if we restrict to boundary intervals with @xmath9 and @xmath11 of infinitesimal coordinate length .",
    "this is also what was done in @xcite , although by a different road , and there it was also shown as having ssa2 respected for this infinitesimal configuration implies ssa2 valid for generic cases .",
    "so only integration along @xmath56 is actually required .",
    "] we finally obtain @xmath119 where the first inequality is guaranteed by the raychaudhuri equation coupled with ( [ intncc ] ) ; the second inequality instead , is the usual argument of figure [ figuraspc ] , but this time applied to extremal surfaces restricted to common achronal slices , one containing @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath120 , and the other @xmath37 , @xmath40 and @xmath121 . on such a slice",
    "extremal surfaces are minimal ( as will also happen when considering the maximin construction of @xcite ) , and that such slices exist on the present static case is what makes the proof applicable here but not on the corresponding time dependent situation , where the work will be harder .",
    "this proves that the integrated ncc implies ( [ intncc ] ) for any adjacent interval configurations in static spacetimes . the reverse is true only for configurations maximizing the ssa2 bound , like the ones discussed in the previous section or in appendix [ a ] .",
    "it is now an interesting question to ask if we can find a purely cft example of violation of strong subadditivity , using a time independent state @xmath0 ( the vacuum ) , as to my knowledge so far all the cases found in the literature rely on the holographic description , often with time dependent metrics . by analysing its holographic counterpart",
    "we can isolate , inside the mechanics of strong subadditivity violation in the bulk , the dual of a genuine boundary cft violation rather then issues of the holographic formula of ee for possibly unphysical backgrounds .",
    "in fact such an example exists and it is when a two dimensional cft has different left and right central charges . the computation of ee for the vacuum was done in @xcite , together with their proposal for the holographic counterpart that we will discuss in the next section , giving as a result for the ee in lorentzian signature ( otherwise the result is complex ) @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the uv regulator and @xmath125 ( or @xmath126 as in the notation of appendix [ a ] ) is the slope of the interval @xmath9 with respect to the constant time line , or equivalently the rapidity of the lorentz boost from a constant time interval to the actual @xmath9 .",
    "let us start with the inequality ssa2 .",
    "we expect the highest amount of violation , if any , by some of the interval configurations that maximize the bound from ssa2 , as explained in appendix [ a ] .",
    "in fact , as the term proportional to @xmath127 inside ( [ clcree ] ) respects ssa2 as it is the usual two dimensional ee result from the vacuum of ( non - lorentz violating ) cfts , to have ssa2 violation we have better to manage an interval configuration that saturates the inequality for that term , or is close enough ( note that the uv regulator @xmath124 simplifies inside the strong subadditivity inequalities ) . among these configurations",
    "the simplest one has the interval @xmath10 at constant time @xmath128 , and @xmath9 and @xmath11 of the same proper length @xmath129 with light - like slopes @xmath130 , @xmath131 ( or @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) . using ( [ clcree ] ) however , it is immediately clear that it respect ssa2 because @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "we then consider some deformations of it , either by studying a generic bound - maximizing structure like the first one in figure [ figuravssa ] , or one where the segment @xmath9 and @xmath11 are made space - like , as in the second picture of figure [ figuravssa ] .",
    "let us start from the first configuration ; writing down the proper lengths of all the intervals as functions of the parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 as appearing in the picture , ssa2 reads as follows @xmath138 @xmath139     are always positive in the second picture , while may be negative in the first with the obvious bounds for positive coordinate length for @xmath11 , @xmath140 , and for space or light - like interval @xmath10 , @xmath141 .",

    "we could nt provide a proof , but numerical analysis for various values of @xmath160 and the complete range of @xmath65 shows that no violation of ssa1 occurs .      in the introduction and section [ init ]",

    "as the analytic continuation is not clear in the broadest context , we will restrict as in @xcite to usual geodesics in einstein metrics .",
    "if we try to prove ssa2 as we have done for static spacetimes and general intervals in section [ faec ] and repeat the steps leading to ( [ sss ] ) , we immediately face a complication : even requiring the integrated ncc ( [ intncc ] ) , the raychaudhuri equation , that allowed us to minimize the proper length along the null geodesics flow of the congruence , does not constrain anymore the growth of the full functional ( [ nfun ] ) as it is no longer simply the proper length of the curve @xmath56 .",
    "even try to enforce some modified energy condition to minimize ( [ nfun ] ) along the null congruence flow and so keep ssa2 valid appears difficult .",
    "this because the term proportional to @xmath161 is essentially a boundary contribution .",
    "we can speculate this being a sign of the essential difference between a violation of ssa2 due to using unphysical backgrounds , and thus entirely avoidable by appropriate bulk conditions , and a violation due to a pure cft mechanism with its dual holographic description .",
    "finally let me discuss briefly on ssa1 .",
    "as in the static case we have here that ssa1 remains valid ; the point is that ssa1 is generically a weaker condition than ssa2 . in the static case we showed that its bound on the ee did not change by varying the interval configuration , remaining monotonicity the condition on @xmath66 . here",
    "the ee is no longer a function of the sole proper length of the interval , and the discussion and the proof do not apply any longer . still the moral appears to be the same , and an interesting development would be to try to generalize them to the present case of @xmath122 two dimensional cfts .",
    "it is time to study time dependent situations , that for the cft means a time dependent quantum state @xmath0 while for the bulk a time dependent metric . for what concerns",
    "the boundary side we unfortunately have not much to say that does not come from holography .",
    "the reason being first the missing knowledge of the state for computable backgrounds ( as the vaidya example we will soon introduce ) , and second the non invariance by time translation that spoils the usual dependence of the ee by only the proper length of the interval .",
    "this means that any ee computation , attempting to verify ssa1 and ssa2 , should pass through the understanding of the bulk description .",
    "this we will now discuss in much more detail .      when a time dependent background is considered , additional complications emerge in understanding the validity or not of strong subadditivity",
    ". first of all hrt surfaces @xmath19 bend in the time direction and thus , even for collinear intervals , intersection does not generically happen .",
    "second , inside the formula ( [ ryutak ] ) , @xmath19 does not refer any longer to minimal surfaces as in the euclidean static case , but to extremal ones .",
    "consequently , even if we had intersection , we could not straightforwardly construct area inequalities as so far done ( unless we could `` project '' the extremal surfaces @xmath35 and @xmath36 to a certain common achronal slice containing @xmath120 and @xmath121 , where they become minimal .",
    "we will soon see that non existence of this slice is the key point for failure of ssa2 . ) .",
    "a first understanding on how and when ssa1 and ssa2 are valid comes from using formula ( [ r0st ] ) , that is the specific case of ( [ r0 ] ) when the boundary interval and its variation are at fixed time . in this case , as we have previously derived , ( [ r0st ] ) is valid even without requirement of time translation invariance .",
    "further in this case we still can write the ee as a a function of the interval length @xmath169 , @xmath170 , with the dependence on the boundary time @xmath98 decoupling when studying inequalities at the same @xmath98 ( while for generic space - like intervals , without time translation invariance , the ee is a generic function of all the coordinate end points , not only the proper length ) .",
    "the positivity of the conformal factor at the vertex @xmath93 is just the monotonicity property that guarantees the validity of ssa1 , but what about ssa2 ? clearly to have the ee @xmath170 concave as a function of @xmath169 , we should have that @xmath171 ( at fixed time @xmath98 ) is monotonically decreasing or , by inverting the function for given @xmath98 , that @xmath172 is monotonically decreasing . is close to the boundary and small @xmath94 to the center of the bulk .",
    "] this means that violation of concavity and ssa2 happens for geodesics whose vertex moves towards the boundary when extending the size @xmath169 of the interval , for fixed @xmath98 .    to understand better this point we can use a theorem by wall , @xcite theorem 17 , that says that if ncc is valid , two geodesics ( maximin surfaces in the paper as we will discuss later ) ending on space - like boundaries one contained in the other , @xmath173 and @xmath174 in our case , will always be at space - like distance one from the other with the smaller one inside , towards the boundary , with respect to the bigger .",
    "so ssa2 is respected . instead giving up ncc",
    "not only time - like distances are possible but , in order to have violation of ssa2 the narrower geodesic should have its vertex extending in the bulk further then the larger one .      to be more concrete",
    "let us consider an example of time dependent , asymptotically ads background , where analytic computations are possible .",
    "this is the vaidya metric , representing the collapse of a mass shell that interpolates between an ads metric and a btz black hole .",

    "the metric is @xmath175 which is an ads solution with the addition of a local energy momentum tensor whose only nonzero component is @xmath176 the case we consider is when @xmath177 is a step function on @xmath178 and @xmath179 becomes a delta . if the delta is positive ( @xmath180 ) the metric will be ads inside for @xmath181 and btz outside for @xmath182 ; if instead the delta is negative ( @xmath183 ) we have btz inside for @xmath181 and ads outside for @xmath182 .",
    "the first case satisfies the ncc , the second violates it , as can be trivially checked . from now on @xmath184 .",
    "geodesics that starts and ends on the boundary and cross the mass shell ( otherwise they are simply contained in the static ads or btz depending on the choice for @xmath177 ) depend on two parameters that , following @xcite , we choose to be @xmath185 and @xmath186 , the bulk radius at which the geodesic crosses the shell and a conserved momentum for the space translation symmetry that turns out to correspond to the radius of the vertex .",

    "the pictures refer to case 1 , case 2 and case 3 respectively . , scaledwidth=120.0% ]      let us now discuss the most general scenario , with time dependent backgrounds and generic adjacent interval configurations .",
    "the starting point for the discussion is the paper by wall @xcite , where the author introduces the concept of maximin surfaces , as an equivalent description of the extremal surfaces @xmath19 .",
    "a codimension two maximin surface is defined starting with a generic codimension one achronal surface @xmath196 in the bulk containing the boundary of the interval @xmath9 ; then a maximin surface is the minimal codimension one surface on @xmath196 having maximal area when varied over all the possible @xmath196 . in brief",
    "the extremality is achieved by minimizing and maximizing in the space and time directions respectively .",
    "the power of the maximin construction is exploited in the theorem that states ( under generic assumptions for the bulk spacetime ) that ssa2 is valid if the ncc condition @xmath197 is respected .",
    "the original proof in @xcite uses ncc and the raychaudhuri equation for constructing inequalities between areas on different achronal slices with the same boundary condition .",
    "this result may be obtained as well just by using the maximin construction alone , so in order to single out the places where the ncc necessarily enters as a condition for ssa2 , and to be naturally lead to the main claim of this section , we slightly modify the proof . skipping some details , that may be found in the original paper ,",
    "it is :    proof : theorem 4 of @xcite states that , given two null congruences of geodesics @xmath198 and @xmath199 , in our case obtained by shooting out null curves from maximin surfaces , with @xmath199 nowhere in the past of @xmath198 and touching at a point @xmath113 belonging to some achronal slice @xmath196 , then there exists a sufficiently small neighbourhood of @xmath113 , @xmath200 , such that either @xmath201 or @xmath198 and @xmath199 do coincide there . given this general result , theorem 14 states that two maximin surfaces with space - like boundary condition ( attached to @xmath120 and @xmath121 in our case ) , are always at space - like distance if ncc holds ; the idea is simply that , as maximin surfaces are extremal , on @xmath120 and @xmath121 we have @xmath202 ; then starting from a situation where the two curves are always at a space - like distance between them , not only close to the boundary but all the way through the bulk , let us suppose we can continuously deform the curves , for example enlarging @xmath203 while keeping @xmath10 fixed , to a situation where somewhere the proper distance approaches the null value ; this means that two points @xmath204 and @xmath205 , one for each curve , are connected by a null geodesics ( for symmetry there is either a single @xmath113 corresponding to the vertex or two symmetric points on the right and left hand side of the vertex ) .",
    "this is shown in the first picture of figure [ figuratld ] .     and",
    "@xmath121.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    let us choose @xmath121 to be nowhere in the past of @xmath120 and focus on @xmath204 ; theorem 4 says that in a neighbourhood of @xmath204 the null congruence @xmath206 . as ncc is valid , @xmath207 and this contradicts the extremality condition .",
    "not being able to continuously approach a light - like distance between any two points , it is then implied that the two curves can not be deformed to develop time - like distances either , as shown in the second picture of figure [ figuratld ] .",
    "this point is crucial for proving theorem 17 that shows that both @xmath120 and @xmath121 always belong to the same achronal slice @xmath196 .",
    "finally the key passage is that , using the maximin construction , there exists a representative for both @xmath35 and @xmath36 on @xmath196 of smaller area ( proper length ) then the maximin surfaces , @xmath208 ( and analogously for @xmath36 ) .",
    "thus on @xmath196 we have @xmath209 where the last inequality is just the usual static argument ( that can now be used as on @xmath196 the surfaces @xmath120 and @xmath121 are minimal and @xmath210 and @xmath211 intersects . ) .",
    "this formulation of the theorem makes evident that a necessary condition for violation of ssa2 is to develop non space - like distances between @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "this is understood as ncc enters the above proof only once , in constraining @xmath120 and @xmath121 to belong to the same achronal slice @xmath196 while remaining at space - like distances .",
    "the importance of this result , that is the non space - like distance between two surfaces @xmath212 and @xmath212 , with the domain of dependence of @xmath213 , @xmath214 , containing @xmath215 , @xmath216 , resides in being a counter example to statements sometimes used in the past literature , for instance conjecture c2 of @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize the difference between the local ncc energy condition obtained in the present section , and the integrated ncc that we obtained for static spacetimes .",
    "the former one is clearly more restricting than the second , as respecting the local ncc obviously implies the integrated ncc , but not the opposite . in fact we could have used the maximin construction for proving that local ncc implies ssa2 for static backgrounds ( which is true ) , but the maximin construction requires the local ncc to be applicable ( for example in proving the equivalence with hrt surfaces ) .",
    "so in order to have the theorem as strong as possible , by requiring the weakest energy condition , we proceeded there without this powerful tool .",
    "given the generic discussion of the past section , let us construct a concrete example , where we show the developing of either null or time - like distances between the two geodesics @xmath120 and @xmath121 , when ncc does not hold and ssa2 is violated , while in general maintaining space - like distances when ncc is valid ( although it is possible to have ssa2 respected in the former case as the condition is necessary but not sufficient ) . in this section",
    "we will study only situations where both the @xmath120 and @xmath121 geodesics belong to the same parameter range ( case 1,2,3 as previously introduced , see also appendix [ b ] ) , even though in appendix [ b ] formulae are provided for the most general scenario",
    ".    our goal will be to probe the distance between the vertices of @xmath120 and @xmath121 to check if they are at space - like distance or not , depending on the value of the parameters @xmath185 and @xmath186 of both curves",
    ". we will not consider distances between generic points on the geodesics as it would be excessively complicated to derive corresponding inequalities and ultimately unnecessary , as non space - like distances between the two curves is just a necessary but not sufficient condition for ssa2 violation .",
    "as the boundary conditions force space - like distance between the end points of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the vertices are likely to be the most prone to develop either null or time - like distances between them , so we restrict to this case .",
    "further to simplify an otherwise too complicated computation we will consider only collinear intervals at the same boundary time @xmath98 and symmetrically disposed around the central point of @xmath10 , that is @xmath9 and @xmath11 are taken to be of the same length .",
    "in appendix [ b ] we derived inequalities for the parameters @xmath185 and @xmath186 of two geodesics @xmath120 and @xmath121 that , when respected , correspond to space - like distances between the vertices .",

    "furthermore we have provided an explicit example in both cases by using the vaidya metric . also some discussion on why violation of strong subadditivity",

    "following are two appendixes containing the results and the proofs ( to my knowledge new ) for what interval configuration , as a function of the slopes , gives the strongest bound on the entanglement entropy inequalities ssa1 and ssa2 , and explicit formulas ( and some derivation ) for the vaidya metric example .",
    "an interesting point of view , that we did not discuss but is worth mentioning , is the result from @xcite where it was shown that virasoro conditions in bosonic string theory imply the ncc on the background geometry .",
    "we would like to suggest that , perhaps , this is a hint that energy conditions may have some uv justification .",
    "the hypothesis is that non respecting ncc ( or analogous conditions ) means that the metric we are using does not consistently arise as a background in theories that correctly quantize gravity , and one of the dual symptoms is not respecting strong subadditivity .",
    "we would like to point out three possible hints for future research .",
    "the first one is the problem of quantum bulk corrections to ee and the question if they do respect or not the boundary strong subadditivity inequality .",
    "for example we can introduce the mutual information @xmath241 and rewrite the ssa2 inequality as , @xcite @xmath242 if the intervals @xmath9 and @xmath10 entering the mutual information are well disconnected , the classic holographic computation gives @xmath243 , as @xmath244 .",
    "thus , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 disconnected the inequality ( [ inmut ] ) just produces a classical @xmath245 result .",
    "quantum corrections in the bulk clearly affect the above inequality ; how to compute them is still a discussed argument as the hrt ( or ryu - takayanagi ) surfaces are not string worldsheets as for the holographic description of wilson loops , but rather just geometrical surfaces .",
    "thus @xmath246 corrections or higher genus computations are not the correct answer .",
    "the question has so far received two different answers in @xcite and @xcite , with pro and con arguments for both .",
    "the question is then if there are reasons to believe that quantum bulk corrections do respect or not strong subadditivity , and/or should they be constrained by energy conditions in doing so ?    a second direction for future research , and also one of the original motivations for the present paper , is the question of what is the logical relationship between strong subadditivity and energy conditions .",
    "we know that the integrated ncc implies ssa2 for static geometries with generic adjacent intervals , and that the two are equivalent for a ssa2-bound - maximizing configuration , and we also know that local ncc implies ssa2 in time dependent systems",
    ". can we deform either the energy condition or the strong subadditivity , weakening or strengthening depending on the case , in order to make the correspondence one to one , in the widest possible range of cases ?",
    "finally we would like to generalize as most as possible of the present paper to generic d - dimensional theories .",
    "part of this work is straightforward , part quite complicated .",
    "we hope to come back to these issues and more in the future .",
    "i would like to thank aron c. wall and horacio casini for email correspondence at the early stage of this work , and diego trancanelli for suggestions and comments on the paper .",

    "instead it may happen that changing some @xmath142 s leads to either increasing or decreasing both sides of the inequality at the same time .",
    "still , using the fact that @xmath66 is monotonically increasing and concave , if we have two intervals with proper lengths @xmath267 and @xmath268 depending on that @xmath142 , @xmath269 , on opposite sides of either ssa1 or ssa2 , there are cases where , without knowing the exact form of the function @xmath66 , we can still say if @xmath270 augments or diminishes :    @xmath271    every other variation of @xmath267 and @xmath268 leads to an undetermined sign for @xmath270 .",
    "let us start with the second inequality ( [ ssa2 ] ) and consider the possible configurations listed in the left side of ( [ ppp ] ) .",
    "from any of the pictures of figure [ figuracldcr ] we can immediately understand that minimizing @xmath253 and at the same time maximizing @xmath272 by varying @xmath126 ( or equivalently with @xmath273 ) , is possible only if @xmath274 and @xmath275 ( increasing @xmath126 ) or if @xmath276 and @xmath277 ( decreasing @xmath126 ) .",
    "if any of these conditions is fulfilled we obtain a stronger bound from ssa2 by changing @xmath126 until it reaches its limiting value @xmath278 or the value for which the condition itself is no longer valid ; if @xmath126 has reached a value different from @xmath278 , or if the above conditions were not fulfilled from the very beginning , the way to maximize @xmath279 is to compare derivatives , as on the right hand side of either ( [ der1 ] ) or ( [ der2 ] ) .      in the present case @xmath280 , thus if it is strictly positive and @xmath281 we should increase @xmath126 either to @xmath282 or to the maximum value for which @xmath203 becomes flat . if @xmath283 ( either as an initial condition or by effect of the growth of @xmath126 ) , then @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "the condition to maximize @xmath279 is @xmath286 that simple algebra transforms into @xmath287 this means that if the slope of @xmath24 , @xmath288 , is higher or equal then the slope of @xmath203 , @xmath289 , then a continuous increment of @xmath126 will lead to a continuous maximization of @xmath279 , until @xmath126 reaches its limiting value of 1 .",
    "thus we always end up with @xmath130 .",
    "this rule that higher slope for an interval means higher rate of change for its proper length when compared with a second interval sharing the same end point , under a variation of the associated @xmath142-angle , is general and applies even when both slopes are negative , just considering absolute values . if @xmath290 the effect of varying @xmath126 would be undetermined , unless we knew the exact form of @xmath66 .    after having sent @xmath291 ,",

    "we can have either positive , null or negative @xmath294 ; if @xmath295 then @xmath296 and it can be either higher or lower ; if @xmath297 the sign of @xmath289 may be positive or negative ( in which case its absolute value is certainly lower than the one of @xmath294 ) .",
    "in all the above cases but one , sending @xmath298 will result in stricter ssa2 inequality , either because of contemporary maximization of @xmath272 and minimization of @xmath299 , or because the rate of decrease for @xmath299 is higher then for @xmath272 ; the only exception being when @xmath300 but lower then @xmath289 .",
    "thus we are led to two cases @xmath301 @xmath302 the final step is to send @xmath303 in the first case . as this is not possible by only acting on @xmath292 , as it may lead to a decrease of @xmath293 , we will contemporary change the value of @xmath304 in order to keep invariant @xmath299 under the change of value of @xmath292 .",
    "that there is a solution for @xmath304 satisfying this condition is guaranteed by the fact that , changing @xmath304 , @xmath299 ranges between @xmath305 and infinity .",
    "this operation keeps invariant everything in ( [ ssa2 ] ) but @xmath272 that a simple computation shows increases .",
    "thus for every set of parameters belonging to the first case above , there is another set of values with @xmath303 and the new @xmath304 , such that ssa2 with these new parameters gives a stricter bound .",
    "the discussion is parallel to the previous section .",
    "we can have either a positive or negative value for @xmath288 and @xmath289 ; in all cases , but when @xmath289 is positive and higher of @xmath288 ( also positive ) , we can move @xmath306 in order to create a stronger bound from ssa2 . on the other side ,",
    "as we always have @xmath295 and either positive but lower , or negative @xmath289 , an increase in the value @xmath307 will certainly lead to a stricter ssa2 inequality .",
    "thus the two possibilities are @xmath308 @xmath309 working in a parallel way to the corresponding ppn case we can make the first case above to @xmath310 , by adjusting the value of @xmath311 .",
    "if @xmath312 , then a continuous increment of @xmath126 will lead to a continuous maximization of @xmath279 , until @xmath126 reaches its limiting value of 1 .",
    "the increase of @xmath293 by varying @xmath292 works similarly , only now we may have @xmath130 ; thus we end up with any of the following cases : @xmath313 @xmath314 @xmath315    it is now possible to reduce all the above to either a ppn or npp configuration by sending the undetermined @xmath142 ( @xmath292 , @xmath126 and either of those for respectively the three cases ) to minus its value , while modifying the corresponding @xmath166 coordinate in order to keep the proper length of either @xmath82 or @xmath24 invariant , as already done in the previous cases .",
    "this operation keeps invariant everything in ( [ ssa2 ] ) but @xmath272 that a simple computation shows increases ( this is not true for a general set of positive @xmath65 , but can be proved in the above listed configurations ) .",
    "thus for every set of values belonging to the three cases above , there is another set of values with @xmath316 and the new @xmath317 , such that ssa2 applied to these new parameters gives a more strict bound than the older case .",
    "then respectively ppp passes to either ppn ( first case , @xmath130 ) or npp ( second case , @xmath133 ) or either ppn or npp , as we wish ( third case ) . from here",
    "on , the procedure of modifying parameters to strengthen the ssa2 inequality bound proceeds as in the previous corresponding sections .      here @xmath318 may be positive or negative . in the first case @xmath319 ( as well as @xmath320 ) so we can reduce @xmath253 at an higher rate than @xmath272 by sending @xmath321 and npn becomes ppn ( with now the positive @xmath289 higher then @xmath294 , thus @xmath292 remains undetermined ) . in the second case",
    "@xmath288 is either positive or negative ; if it is positive again @xmath321 ( decreasing @xmath253 and increasing @xmath272 until it becomes eventually flat , and then decreasing it as well but at a lower rate ) so again ppn with undetermined @xmath292 .",
    "if instead @xmath322 , its absolute value is lower then @xmath289 , then @xmath126 can not be changed and we consider @xmath294 . if it is positive @xmath323 and we obtain npp ; if it is negative we have @xmath288 and @xmath294 negative and their moduli lower than @xmath289 , so @xmath324 are undetermined : @xmath325 @xmath326 @xmath327 @xmath328 in the last case",
    "we can apply the same procedure used in the previous section , that is sending ( for example ) @xmath329 while changing @xmath304 in order to keep fixed @xmath299 .",
    "again it can be checked that this increases @xmath272 , and thus we end up with npp . from here on we work as in the first two sections .",
    "we can finally say that making ssa2 inequality stricter leads to either ppn with @xmath330 or npp with @xmath310 , that is the a and c segments become light - like and on the same `` time side '' with respect to b. the slope of b remains general and positive ( as the negative values are covered by the parity transformation ( [ ppp ] ) ) . to make the ssa2 bound stronger , but the result always leads to an undetermined change for the inequality , and even the trick of modifying some of the @xmath166 coordinate as done before does not help ( as either there are non positive solutions or the new set of parameter leads to a weaker bound ) .",
    "the analysis deals with all the single cases and it is quite boring , so we avoid presenting it in detail . ]      here the work is easier as the @xmath10 interval only appears on one side of the inequality .",
    "moreover the sign on @xmath126 and @xmath292 only affect one side as well .",
    "this leads to the choice of ppp over any other configuration ( @xmath331 and @xmath332 are unaffected by @xmath333 but sign changes leading to the ppp configuration always decrease @xmath253 and @xmath299 , everything else being fixed ) , and @xmath334 ( it reduces both @xmath253 and @xmath299 while keeping invariant @xmath331 and @xmath332 ) .",
    "a further attempt to shift the value of @xmath324 towards zero in order to decrease @xmath335 and @xmath336 fails , as the slopes of @xmath9 and @xmath11 are always lower ( @xmath10 is light - like ) then respectively the slopes of @xmath24 and @xmath82 ( and we do not fit the criteria of equation ( [ der2 ] ) , nor does it work the trick of changing the value of @xmath337 to keep @xmath253 fixed while increasing @xmath331 , as the solution for @xmath337 is in general not positive ) .",
    "so the most strict bound on @xmath66 from ssa1 , with generic @xmath160 , comes from the configuration @xmath338 .",
    "the main reference is @xcite .",

    "note that the coordinates @xmath94 and @xmath340 are continuous across the shell , while @xmath165 has a finite discontinuity .",
    "the metric in @xmath339 coordinates is        we want to solve the equation for a geodesic when ncc is violated ( see also appendix a of @xcite , while the easier case for ncc respected is treated in section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "the case we will consider is when the geodesic s end points on the bulk s boundary are at the same time @xmath98 , and separated by a space distance @xmath348 .",
    "as the metric is @xmath166 independent there is a conserved charge @xmath186 ; further the metric is also @xmath165 independent but when crossing the shell , thus we can use also a charge e , conserved independently in ads and btz . they can be computed to be @xmath349 where the overdot represents a derivative with respect to the affine parameter @xmath350 defined on the space - like geodesic as @xmath351 as the lagrangian along the `` time '' @xmath350 is @xmath352 we can write the equation @xmath353 that leads to the two equations ( the second obtained dividing by @xmath354 and rewriting @xmath355 ) @xmath356 there are two additional equations we need to derive relating the internal and external @xmath94 derivative on the shell ; they are obtained by locally extremizing the geodesic by varying the intersection point with the shell , @xmath357 ( @xmath358 ) given two generic nearby geodesic points , one in ads and one in btz @xcite .",
    "the geodesic will experience a refraction with the difference between the two @xmath359 as @xmath360 the space - like geodesics with two end points on the boundary and crossing the shell ( twice ) are the ones we are interested in ; these geodesics are symmetric with respect to the axis that passes through their vertex and the middle between the two end points ( as we will fix the two end points to be at the same time @xmath165 ) .",
    "thus also the two crossing points on the shell are at the same time @xmath165 ( different by the one at the boundary ) , so @xmath361 inside the shell and for btz @xmath362 .",

    "the choice @xmath484 does not translate to an easy condition on the parameter space , so it is more convenient to avoid it and independently deal with the cases @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "the inequalities representing space - like distances between the vertices thus are :      the parameter range for @xmath230 is then limited by the three constraints @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath225 . inside this volume",
    "we separately deal with the subspaces @xmath234 and @xmath235 ; now we can apply ( [ in11 ] ) and ( [ in12 ] ) on the relevant space and see if they are satisfied or not .",
    "it turns out that when @xmath235 , @xmath236 is always respected , while @xmath237 is respected in some region and violated in its complementary , as is shown in figure [ figura7 ] .    on the other side when @xmath234 @xmath238 is always respected , while @xmath239 is respected in some region and violated in its complementary ( with respect to the total space ) .",
    "this is shown in figure [ figura8 ] .",
    "now we have btz outside and ads inside the shell . skipping the derivation , that is easier then the one in the previous sections and can be found in @xcite , we limit ourselves in listing the relevant formulas for our purposes .",
    "the boundary time is @xmath489 with @xmath490 @xmath491 the equivalent of ( [ pxt ] ) for the above @xmath98 is instead given by @xmath492 finally the total @xmath166 coordinate length covered by the geodesic at the boundary can be computed to be in the corresponding formula for @xmath493 of @xcite in front of the log . ]",
    "@xmath494 with this we can repeat the analysis of the previous sections ; for geodesics crossing the shell and whose vertices are in ads , the difference between their @xmath340-coordinates becomes ( @xmath235 and @xmath495 in ads for the usual symmetry argument ) @xmath496 and the space - like condition is @xmath497 or more easily @xmath498 given @xmath499 by ( [ pxads ] ) ( restricting to the parameter space such that @xmath235 , and with the corresponding version of ( [ csl ] ) given by @xmath500 on the complementary @xmath234 ) , we can already visualize the parameter volume that respect the first and second of ( [ csl ] ) .",
    "again we also implement the constrain on the parameter space such that the difference between @xmath501 and @xmath502 is smaller then some arbitrarily small number .",
    "numerical results in random parameter domains show that vertices are always at space - like distance one from the other .",
