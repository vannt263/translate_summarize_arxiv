    "the transport property of quantum particles ( or classical waves ) in media is one of the central problems in physics .",
    "a textbook example is the dynamics of bloch electrons in solid state crystals @xcite . for a long time , the semiclassical equations of motion ( eom ) of electrons are known to be solely determined by the energy band dispersion @xcite .",
    "recently it was found that geometric gauge fields due to berry phase @xcite effects may modify the eom of particles @xcite in a chiral medium , leading to new and important physical phenomena and applications @xcite . here chiral \" means that the time reversal or spatial inversion symmetry in the medium is broken",
    ".    however , the eom in current literature neglect several important properties of particles ( or waves ) and media ( _ e.g. _ , self rotation of particles , frequency ( or energy ) dependence and dissipation of the media ) . in this paper , we derive a new set of eom of particles where the effects of these properties are included . for simplicity of the presentation , we consider a concrete physical system : light propagation in photonic crystals @xcite , although the results are applicable to many other systems @xcite . instead of wavepacket dynamics commonly used in previous literature , we adopt a geometric optics approach that has been proved to be extremely valuable for describing light propagation in usual optical materials .",
    "however , the traditional approach of geometric optics is inadequate because the light wavelength is typically the same order as the unit cell size of the photonic crystals within which the dielectric constant varies .",
    "the new geometric optics theory is presented for light propagation in a frequency band of a chiral and dissipative photonic crystal under perturbations which vary slowly in space and time compared to the lattice constant and the band gaps .",
    "we focus on the poynting vector field , averaged over the crystal unit cell , which traces the geometric optics rays ( _ i.e. _ , the eom ) .",
    "it involves the photon wavepacket center velocity , and also contains two additional terms due to the photon orbital angular momentum ( poam ) and the dissipation of the medium that are absent in previous wavepacket theory of photons @xcite .",
    "we show that , in a concrete example , the term from poam can dramatically modify the transport properties of light in photonic crystals .",
    "the propagation of light is also affected by various geometric gauge fields due to berry phase effects .",
    "both poam and berry phase originate from the chirality of the medium or the particle .",
    "two such gauge fields mimic closely the electric and magnetic fields for electrons @xcite , and two other fields arise from berry curvatures in the momentum - frequency space , previously called reciprocal electromagnetic fields in the context of electron semiclassical dynamics @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of the reciprocal electric field is illustrated .",
    "there are also fields from berry curvatures in other facets of the extended phase space .",
    "all these fields can be calculated based on the band structure wave functions of the photonic crystal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces the wave equations and the wavepacket dynamics for light propagation in photonic crystals . in section iii",
    ", a geometric optics theory for light propagation in photonic crystals is developed .",
    "section iv gives an example of the application of the theory .",
