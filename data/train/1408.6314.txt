    "@xmath5 transition metal oxides have recently attracted great interest due to the interplay between spin - orbit and coulomb interactions which can give rise to novel many - body quantum states , including the theoretically proposed weyl semimetal,@xcite topological mott insulator,@xcite or high - temperature superconductivity upon carrier doping.@xcite these studies have been largely motivated by the experiments in a model compound sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , which suggest that the low - energy electronic states can be suitably represented by their effective total angular momentum @xmath6 , and argue that the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 orbitals are split into a fully filled @xmath4 manifold and a singly occupied @xmath3 band.@xcite it has been proposed that the modest coulomb interactions of the @xmath5 electrons can then result in a further splitting of the half - filled @xmath3 band into a fully occupied valence band and an unoccupied conduction band .    at present , there remains considerable debate about whether iridates are better described as mott insulators,@xcite in analogy to the conventional @xmath10 transition metal oxides , or as slater insulators,@xcite where the insulating behavior is tied directly to long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "for example , recent scanning tunnel spectroscopy on sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 has reported an onset of the temperature dependent spectra below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature @xmath2 , consistent with dynamical mean field theory results,@xcite although the in - gap spectral weight is still strongly suppressed even above @xmath2 , as also seen in other spectroscopy experiments.@xcite in order to definitively address these issues , it has become critical to systematically examine other related @xmath5 transition metal oxides , such as ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "this also opens new avenues to realize proposed exotic phases such as superconductivity which may exist at the intersection between strong spin - orbit interactions and electron correlations .",

    "in addition , ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 has a number of distinct advantages over sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , including the capacity for being metallized either through carrier doping ( k or la substitution for ba ) @xcite or through the application of hydrostatic pressure,@xcite making it an excellent platform for searching for the possibility of exotic , iridate - based superconductivity . unfortunately , layered ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 is metastable in bulk and",

    "although the gap survives well into the paramagnetic state , only the @xmath3 band exhibits a substantial broadening and ` softening ' of the gap with increasing temperature approaching @xmath2 reminiscent of some of the parent cuprate superconductors,@xcite suggesting the importance of long - range antiferromagnetic order .",

    "the @xmath50 and @xmath47 states near @xmath44 are observed to be very close in energy to the @xmath43 states , and in fact form the lowest lying states in the predicted valence band maximum at @xmath44 , at odds with experiment , but also observed in previous works on sr@xmath0iro@xmath1.@xcite comparisons with the dft calculations indicate that these states are of predominately @xmath4 character ; the @xmath6 character of these states do not appear to depend strongly on @xmath45 ( figs .",

    "et al._.@xcite this underscores the importance of low - lying @xmath4 states in the low energy physics of the layered iridates , and that the bandwidth of the @xmath3 and 3/2 states is substantially larger than their splittings .",
    "the faint dispersion especially around 0.5 ev centered at @xmath51 is likely a folded feature of the corresponding @xmath50 band at @xmath44 , which is probably due to the @xmath52 in - plane surface structural distortion observed in the leed images ( figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "however , the effect of this reconstruction on the observed electronic structure appears much smaller than in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 , in that the intensity of the reflected shadow band around @xmath42 is significantly weaker than at @xmath44 , whereas in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 the intensity of these features are comparable .",
    "this may also imply that the octahedral rotation angles observed at the surface of the ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 films are substantially smaller than those in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1.@xcite    here it is meaningful to quantitatively compare the observed energy bands with the calculated ones .",
    "the experimentally extracted bandwidths ( separation from band minimum to maximum ) are @xmath53 ev , @xmath54 ev , @xmath55 ev , and @xmath56 ev . on the other hand , the corresponding values in the dft calculations with @xmath45 of 2.5 ev are @xmath57 ev , @xmath58 ev , @xmath59 ev , and @xmath60 ev , respectively . setting @xmath45 to zero only increases these bandwidths slightly to @xmath61 ev , @xmath62 ev , @xmath63 ev , and @xmath64 ev ,",
    "but this weak renormalization reflects the relatively modest effective coulomb interaction of the 5@xmath41 electrons , in contrast to the much larger bandwidth renormalization typically observed in the high-@xmath65 cuprates .",
    "the other remarkable point is the energy difference between the @xmath46 and @xmath50 bands .",
    "since this gap at the @xmath66 point directly measures the spin - orbit coupling parameter as suggested by tight - binding models,@xcite the spin - orbit interaction in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 is experimentally determined to be @xmath67 ev , which is also consistent to the reports on other iridate systems.@xcite     ev binding energy , ( b ) crystal structure projected on ( 001 ) , and ( c ) @xmath68 versus @xmath69 spectra along high - symmetry lines for ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",

    "the folded bands are more clearly visible in the @xmath68 versus @xmath69 plots shown in figs . 6(c ) and ( f ) .",

    "we interpret the weaker reconstruction observed in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 as an indication that the amount of octahedral rotation due to the surface reconstruction is significantly less than in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",

    "furthermore , the linewidth broadens continuously at a rate of @xmath75 mev / k with increasing temperature , again expected from the thermal excitations of the bosonic dressing observed in polaronic systems such as sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 and the undoped cuprates.@xcite this unusual temperature dependence of the peak position suggests that only the @xmath3 band , which drives the insulator - metal transition , responds dramatically to the presence of long - range antiferromagnetism , while the @xmath4 states , which are nearby in energy , do not respond appreciably to the onset of the long - range antiferromagnetic order . the single particle excitation gap is directly enhanced by the presence of antiferromagnetic order , which would not be expected in simple mott insulators , but suggestive of a slater insulator , where the charge gap is directly tied to spin - density wave order .",

    "furthermore , the nonmonotonic change of the observed @xmath3 states through @xmath2 suggests the possibility that the effective coulomb interactions may be enhanced below @xmath2 accompanied by an ordering of the local moments . for example , in the antiferromagnetic mott insulator latio@xmath11 , a similar nonmonotonic change of the mott gap through @xmath2 has been reported.@xcite     band dispersion and ( b ) the in - plane spin state in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",

    "the magnitude of the gap itself is relatively small and the bandwidth is found to be barely renormalized relative to the predictions from density functional theory , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "this is in stark contrast to conventional @xmath10 transition metal oxide mott insulators which feature a much larger charge gap and a more strongly renormalized bandwidth ( fig .",
    "8(d ) ) , a clear distinction between the parent insulating state of the layered iridates versus the cuprates .",
    "when the spin - orbit interaction is sufficiently strong , even a modest coulomb repulsion is sufficient to push the nearly fully occupied @xmath4 band below @xmath14 ( blue ) , while splitting the half - filled @xmath3 band ( orange ) .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic ground state and its temperature evolution in ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 using a combination of reactive oxide molecular beam epitaxy and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "a comparison between the experimental data and theoretical calculations have demonstrated the importance of the @xmath4 states for accurately describing the low - energy electronic structure .",
    "our measurements have revealed that while the @xmath3 and 3/2 bands are barely renormalized relative to the band structure calculations , the two bands exhibit an unusual dichotomy in their behavior through the n ' eel transition . only the split @xmath3 subband shows a substantial softening of the gap with increasing temperature approaching @xmath2 , suggesting an important role of the antiferromagnetic ordering in the formation of the insulating phase , while the gap itself remains robust well into the paramagnetic state .",
    "this surprising contrast in the behavior of the low - energy @xmath3 and 3/2 states should be crucial in developing accurate effective low - energy models to describe the parent insulating layered iridates and any emergent ground states , such as exotic superconductivity , that may be realized upon carrier doping .",

    "<S> we employ molecular beam epitaxy to stabilize ba@xmath0iro@xmath1 thin films and utilize _ in situ _ angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the evolution of its electronic structure through the n ' eel temperature @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements indicate that dispersions of the relativistic @xmath3 and 3/2 bands exhibit an unusual dichotomy in their behavior through the n ' eel transition . </S>",
    "<S> although the charge gap survives into the paramagnetic state , only the @xmath3 state exhibits a strong temperature dependence and its gap softens with increasing temperature approaching @xmath2 , while the nearly fully occupied @xmath4 state which remains nearby in energy exhibits negligible changes with temperature . </S>"
