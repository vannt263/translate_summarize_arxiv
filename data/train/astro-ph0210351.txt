    "m dwarf stars often show h@xmath1 in emission , but the frequency of h@xmath1  emission peaks around type m7 and declines for later - type l and t dwarfs ( gizis et  al .",
    "the only objects of type l5 or later seen to exhibit strong h@xmath1  are the persistent h@xmath1-emitting t6.5 dwarf 2massi j1237392 + 652615 ( 2002 ; hereafter b02 ) , the flaring l5 dwarf 2massi j0144353@xmath0071614 ( liebert et  al .",
    "2003 ) and the l5 dwarf 2massi j1315309@xmath0264951 ( 2002 ; gizis 2002 ; hereafter h02 and g02 ) .",
    "i report on a new spectrum and a proper motion estimate of this latter object , hereafter 2mass 1315@xmath02649 , which are of interest given the rarity of l and t dwarfs with strong h@xmath1  and the uncertain mechanism(s ) driving such emission .",
    "spectroscopy of 2mass1315@xmath02649 was secured beginning at 00:15 on ut 2002 september 9 using the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) at the eso 3.6 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) .",
    "a 316 lines / mm grating blazed at 6200  was used to cover the wavelength range 4500@xmath07000  at 1.575 / pixel and resolution 4.6 , given the 1  slit .",
    "three 5-minute exposures were obtained at the parallactic angle . despite cirrus and the high airmass .",
    "the unresolved h@xmath1  line is readily visible on the individual exposures .",
    "the sky - subtracted spectrum was extracted using an aperture eight pixels ( 2664 ) wide .",
    "cd@xmath0329927 ( hamuy et  al . 1994 ) was used for flux calibration .    as in h02 ,",
    "the continuum was measured at 6400@xmath06550   and 6575@xmath06725 , and the average used for the equivalent width calculation .",
    "i find an h@xmath1  ew=124@xmath555(@xmath6 , following h02 ) , compared with 121@xmath531  in march 2001 and 25@xmath510  in august 2001 ( h02 ) , and 97  in may 2001 ( g02 ) .",
    "either the august 2001 measurement is a spurious outlier and the object has persistent , nonvariable h@xmath1  emission of ew@xmath7100   ( @xmath8 ) , or the h@xmath1  emission is continuously flaring or slowly variable with that same ew .",
    "smaller uncertainties on the h@xmath1  fluxes than the current 25 - 40% are needed to distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "note that h@xmath9  was not detected to a 3@xmath10 limiting flux equal to 37% of the h@xmath1  flux .",
    "that is , the balmer decrement is h@xmath1/h@xmath9@xmath112.7 in this object .",
    "this is larger than the value 2.3 measured for pc0025 + 0447 by ( 1994 ) , but similar to the limit h@xmath1/h@xmath9@xmath114.2 measured for 2mass 1237 + 6526 by ( 2000 ) ; see  [ disc ] .",
    "an unfiltered ccd image was taken just prior to the ntt spectroscopy .",
    "the exposure time was 3 minutes and the pixel scale was 0333@xmath50001 . the image shows both 2mass1315@xmath02649 and usnoj131531.230@xmath0264953.01 , an optically brighter star slightly south of east .",
    "the separation between the objects ( epoch 2002.685 ) is 714@xmath5005 , including the systematic uncertainty due to differential refraction , at pa 962 east of north .",
    "this is significantly different from the 2mass - usno coordinate separation of 423@xmath5032 at pa 1145 , where uncertainties of 025 and 02 have been assumed for the usno ( mean epoch 1977.792 ) and 2mass ( epoch 1998.411 ) positions , respectively .",
    "systematic errors between usno and 2mass are possible , but an @xmath12 star located only 38  distant has coordinates that differ by only 023 .",
    "thus it appears that the objects separation has increased significantly since the 2mass observations , as suggested by h02 .    assuming the usno star has negligible proper motion",
    ", 2mass1315@xmath02649 has a proper motion of 0.71@xmath50.07 arcsec year@xmath2 at pa 2538.03 .",
    "] this is approximately ten times larger than expected if 2mass1315@xmath02649 is a member of the tw hya association of young stars ( it was selected for observation by g02 as a candidate member ) . at the distance of @xmath323@xmath52 pc",
    "estimated ( using fig .",
    "7.21 of 2002 ) from its apparent magnitude and spectral type ( l5 , from the high quality spectrum of g02 ) , the proper motion corresponds to a transverse velocity of @xmath376@xmath510kms@xmath2 .",
    "this rather large velocity suggests that 2mass1315@xmath02649 is relatively old and massive , as discussed further below .",
    "four epochs of spectroscopy now exist for 2mass 1315@xmath02649 , three of which show @xmath13 .",
    "thus this object is a persistent , strong h@xmath1  emitter , of which only a few other examples are known among the m , l and t dwarfs : the m9.5 dwarf pc 0025 + 0447 ( , basri , & zapatero osorio 1999 ; hereafter mbz99 ) , the t6.5 dwarf 2mass 1237 + 6526 (  [ intro ] ) and possibly the m9 dwarf lp 412 - 31 ( 2000 ,  6.2 ) , which has just two spectral epochs and is not discussed further .",
    "the m dwarf pc0025 + 0447 has always been observed to have strong h@xmath1  emission ( @xmath14 ) , yet it also shows classic signatures of flaring .",
    "mbz99 show that the h@xmath1  strength varies on timescales of days to years by up to a factor of four ( from ew 390@xmath545  to 110@xmath515 ) , emission is sometimes seen , and the optical spectrum is veiled by an additional blue continuum when the emission lines are stronger .",
    "a t tauri interpretation is disfavored by the lack of an obvious near - infrared excess and by line profiles dissimilar from those of t tauri stars .",
    "thus mbz99 conclude that pc0025 + 0447 has a highly active chromosphere and/or corona ; it very likely has continuous strong flares .",
    "continuous weak flaring occurs in many late - type dwarfs ( tsikoudi et  al .",
    "2000 ) , but typically with h@xmath1  equivalent widths ten to a hundred times smaller .",
    "the t dwarf 2mass 1237 + 6526 has h@xmath1  emission of @xmath15 ( b02 ) that is constant to within 10%  over three epochs spanning two years .",
    "thus it is unlikely to have continuous strong flares .",
    "b02 suggest that it could be a young , very low - mass brown dwarf still accreting material from a surrounding disk , similar to the weak - lined t tauri stars .",
    "however , they can not completely rule out a close brown dwarf binary accretion hypothesis .",
    "existing observations of 2mass1315@xmath02649 are insufficient to determine to which of the above two objects it is most similar.2649 was not detected in the radio by nvss nor in x - rays by rosat . ]",
    "three of four spectra taken over 1.5 years are consistent with a constant h@xmath1  flux ( to within @xmath330% ) .",
    "the discrepant observation is of the lowest quality , but other than that there is no a priori reason to discard it .",
    "however , the proper motion and balmer decrement of 2mass 1315@xmath02649 may be clues to the origin of its h@xmath1 .",
    "since the velocity dispersion of disk stars increases with age , the large transverse velocity inferred for 2mass1315@xmath02649 from its proper motion suggests that it is @xmath42  gyr old ( dahn et  al .",
    "2002 ) and therefore relatively massive for its spectral type .",
    "this is consistent with the correlation noted for weaker h@xmath1  emitters by ( 2000 ) , namely that  active l dwarfs are drawn from an older , more massive population . \"",
    "unless the incidence of close brown dwarf binaries is a strong function of mass , strong magnetic fields appear to be the only plausible explanation for this trend .",
    "the inferred high mass of 2mass1315@xmath02649 thus suggests it is a continuously flaring object with an unusually strong magnetic field .",
    "gas that is optically thin in the balmer lines will have h@xmath1/h@xmath9@xmath163.3 for all 2500@xmath17@xmath18@xmath17@xmath19k ( ferland 1980 ; martin 1988 ) , whereas balmer decrements as high as @xmath35 are seen in t tauri stars , produced in optically thick , low - ionization gas at @xmath18@xmath3@xmath20k ( lamzin et  al .",
    "these observations appear nicely consistent with pc0025 + 0447 having h@xmath1/h@xmath9@xmath32.3 due to flares and 2mass 1237 + 6526 having h@xmath1/h@xmath9@xmath114.2 due to disk ( or close binary ) accretion , but this is misleading .",
    "flares are complex processes arising in chromospheric gas with @xmath21@xmath310@xmath22@xmath23 , sufficient to be optically thick in lower - order balmer lines ( houdebine et  al .",
    "1991 ) , and so a chromospheric origin for emission with h@xmath1/h@xmath9@xmath113.3 can not be ruled out .",
    "in fact , dwarfs later than m4 often have h@xmath9/h@xmath9@xmath113.3 , and values up to 15 have been seen ( gizis , reid , & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "given this large range of h@xmath1/h@xmath9  seen in normal dwarf star chromospheres , 2mass1315@xmath02649 could have continuous strong flares like pc0025 + 0047 despite having a larger balmer decrement ( h@xmath1/h@xmath9@xmath112.7 at 3@xmath10 ) .",
    "the origin of the persistent , strong h@xmath1  emission of 2mass 1315@xmath02649 remains unclear .",
    "its inferred old age makes it unlikely to be a brown dwarf t tauri analog and its inferred high mass suggests that it has continuous strong flares , but existing observations can not rule out an accreting brown dwarf binary scenario . as with the other two known persistent , strong h@xmath1  emitting dwarf stars , determining the origin of the emission will require high - quality spectroscopic or photometric monitoring ."
