    "precise parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) are an essential ingredient in analysing data obtained at high energy hadron colliders , such as the tevatron and the lhc . in perturbative",
    "qcd the pdfs are now known at next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "indeed , with the current precision , it is important to investigate the effect of electroweak corrections in hadron collider physics .",
    "in particular , the qed contributions have large logarithmic terms , up to @xmath3log@xmath4 , arising from photons emitted from the incoming quark lines . at high",
    "@xmath5 scales these corrections should be resummed .",
    "fortunately the qcd factorisation theorem also applies to qed , and so the photon - induced logarithms can be absorbed into the pdfs , just as the @xmath6log@xmath5 terms are summed by dglap evolution . as a consequence",
    "the normal dglap equations are slightly modified and a photon parton distribution function of the proton , @xmath7 , is generated .",
    "thus , for example , ( at leading order in both @xmath6 and @xmath3 ) we have an extra equation for the evolution of the photon pdf = ^1_x(p_+ _ 1 e_i^2 p_q q_i ) , [ eq : evol ] where p_(y)=-_i e_i^2(1-y ) ,   p_q = c_f^-1 p_gq .",
    "similarly , the photon pdf , @xmath8 , contributes to the evolution @xmath9log@xmath5 via the @xmath10 splitting .",
    "indeed , with the present level of precision , it has become topical to treat the photon as one of the point - like partons inside the nucleon and to account for this qed effect explicitly in the global parton analysis .",
    "this approach was first followed ten years ago by mrst(2004 ) @xcite .",
    "recently it has been used by the nnpdf @xcite and cteq @xcite groups .",
    "the central issue is the choice of input distributions for the photon pdfs of the proton and neutron .    in the original mrst study",
    "it was assumed that the starting distributions are given by one - photon emission off valence ( constituent ) quarks in the leading logarithm approximation .",
    "for example , for the photon pdf of the proton the starting distribution was taken to be splitting function explicitly ; whereas in @xcite it was simply denoted by @xmath12 . ] ^p(x , q^2_0 )  =   , [ eq:2 ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the valence - like distributions of the proton , and where the current quark masses were used .",
    "the most direct measurement of the photon pdf at the time of the mrst analysis appeared to be wide - angle scattering of the photon by a electron beam via the process @xmath15 , where the final state electron and photon are produced with equal and opposite large transverse momentum .",
    "the subprocess is qed compton scattering .",
    "] , @xmath16 , for which the contribution to the cross section is ( epex )  =  dx^  ^p(x^,^2 )  ( ee ) , [ eq : comp ] where @xmath17 is the factorization scale .",
    "mrst @xcite predicted a cross section in agreement with the only measurement of this process available at that time @xcite .",
    "the nnpdf @xcite and cteq @xcite groups use a different approach to mrst .",
    "they parametrise the input photon pdfs , @xmath18 , and attempt to determine the parameters from the global data , along with the quark and gluon pdfs .",
    "unfortunately the present data are not of sufficient accuracy to provide a reasonable determination of the photon input .    the nnpdf collaboration @xcite used freely parametrised ( without bias ) starting distributions , including the photon pdfs , and constrain the photon pdfs mainly from the drell - yan ( low - mass , on - shell @xmath19 and @xmath20 production and high - mass ) lhc data .",
    "there is expected to be the most sensitivity to the low - mass drell - yan data @xcite .",
    "however , the uncertainties observed in the resulting photon pdfs are huge , especially at low @xmath21 .",
    "the preliminary cteq analysis @xcite proceeds differently .",
    "cteq keep a similar theoretical form of the distributions @xmath18 to that proposed by mrst , but with an arbitrary normalisation parameter , which is expressed as the momentum fraction , @xmath22 , carried by the input photon .",
    "they find that the constraint coming from the energy - momentum sum rule is weak ( allowing @xmath22 to range up to 5@xmath23 ) , while to fit the updated zeus data for @xmath15 @xcite requires @xmath24 , using the valence quark induced input ( [ eq:2 ] ) and allowing for the extra normalisation parameter .",
    ", corresponding , respectively , to photon emission directly from the proton and from a quark.,height=491 ]    unlike the above analyses , here we emphasize that the major part of the input , @xmath25 , especially at low @xmath21 , comes from the _ coherent _ emission of the photon from the ` elastic ' proton , which can be calculated theoretically with good accuracy .",
    "the process is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "( the previous analyses are based only on _ incoherent _ emission from individual quarks within the proton . ) the uncertainty on our determination @xmath26 comes essentially only from the relatively small contribution @xmath27 which , from a hadron viewpoint , actually corresponds to the qed excitations of the proton into higher mass states .",
    "however , here , in section [ sec:3 ] we adopt the quark viewpoint , and calculate this contribution as the incoherent emission of photons from quarks within the proton .",
    "this contribution turns out to be relatively small .",
    "therefore , since @xmath28 may be calculated with good accuracy , it means that the uncertainty in the theoretically determined photon input distributions is expected to be small ; essentially coming from the uncertainty in the ` extrapolation ' of valence quarks needed to estimate the contribution to @xmath27 coming from the region below the starting scale @xmath29 . we will quantify this uncertainty below .",
    "we summarize the discussion of this section in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "[ h ]    .an outline of the procedure used by the various groups to determine the photon pdf . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     at large @xmath30 , the contribution of the compton - induced process decreases rapidly . in this domain , inclusive isolated photons",
    "are mainly produced by quarks , see fig .",
    "[ fig : llqq](b ) .    note that in our theoretical calculation of @xmath31 we have accounted for the angular , the @xmath32 and the other experimental cuts imposed by the zeus collaboration @xcite , but we have no possibility to include the photon isolation criteria .",
    "therefore the observed cross section corresponding to the ll process should be lower than our prediction .    in table [ tab:3 ]",
    "we compare our prediction of the ll contribution with @xmath32 dependence of the measured cross section .",
    "however , now the data were collected over a large rapidity interval : @xmath33 . here",
    "the quark contribution is important , and the ll subprocess describes only about half of the cross section .",
    "we have demonstrated that the major part of the photon input pdf of the proton ( caused by the coherent emission of the photon that does not destroy the proton ) can be calculated with good accuracy .",
    "this strongly reduces the possible uncertainties in the qed part of an extended global parton analysis which includes the photon as a point - like parton . in this way",
    ", we evaluate the expected photon pdfs by dglap evolution with lo qed splittings and nlo mstw quarks . note that the further step of including the photon - to - quark splitting will introduce a small violation of isospin symmetry in the ` singlet ' pdf , in particular @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting photon distributions agree with data for the electroproduction of isolated photons , @xmath31 , at negative rapidities where the cross section is dominated by the @xmath16 hard subprocess .",
