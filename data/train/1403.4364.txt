    "modifying general relativity has been one of the most highlighted fields in gravitational physics in recent years .",
    "long distance modification of gravity has been studied extensively so as to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . more theoretically , it is interesting to ask the simple question of whether one can consistently modify general relativity to accommodate , _",
    "e.g. _ , massive gravitons  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "modified theories of gravity can be described , at least effectively , by adding an extra scalar degree of freedom that participates in the dynamics of gravity .",
    "the most general lagrangian composed of the metric @xmath3 and a scalar @xmath4 and having second - order field equations will therefore be a powerful tool to study various aspects of modified gravity , and , interestingly , the theory was already constructed forty years ago by horndeski  @xcite .",
    "recently , the horndeski theory was rediscovered  @xcite and shown to be equivalent to the generalized galileon  @xcite .",
    "while considerable attention has been devoted to cosmological applications of the horndeski theory , black holes in that theory have been less explored so far .    in the context of scalar - tensor modification of gravity ,",
    "one of the central questions to address is whether or not black holes can have scalar hair .",
    "it has been proven by hawking that a black hole can not have scalar hair in the brans - dicke theory  @xcite . in the traditional scalar - tensor theory",
    "where @xmath4 is nonminimally coupled to gravity , the scalar - no - hair theorem was formulated in  @xcite ( under the assumption of spherical symmetry ) , and a more general proof was provided recently in  @xcite , while the no - hair theorem for a noncanonical scalar field , _ i.e. _ , k - essence , was given in  @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask how those results can be extended to theories whose lagrangian contains second derivatives of @xmath4 .",
    "such theories are motivated by the galileon  @xcite , for which the equation of motion still remains of second order . for the galileon",
    "coupled to gravity , hui and nicolis have shown that static and spherically symmetric black holes can not be surrounded by any nontrivial profile of the scalar field  @xcite .",
    "the key of the proof of ref .",
    "@xcite is shift symmetry of the scalar field , _ i.e. _ , symmetry under @xmath0 , where @xmath5 is a constant , and the regularity of the square of the noether current associated with this symmetry .",
    "therefore , the same argument seems to hold for more general scalar - tensor theories with the same symmetry , though there are some loopholes .",
    "one loophole can be opened by abandoning the static configuration of @xmath4 and/or relaxing some asymptotic conditions on the metric and @xmath4 , and hairy black hole solutions have thus been constructed explicitly in ref .",
    "one can also circumvent the no - hair theorem by tuning the lagrangian  @xcite . in light of the former loophole , exact black hole solutions with scalar hair",
    "have been found in the theory with nonminimal derivative coupling to the einstein tensor , @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath6 has shift symmetry and reflection symmetry , @xmath7 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend those previous works to go beyond this particular example , giving various exact black hole solutions with scalar hair in a subclass of the horndeski theory possessing shift and reflection symmetries .",
    "the theory contains two _ arbitrary _ functions of @xmath2 , and we will provide a variety of solutions without specifying the concrete form of those functions .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we present the theory and the black hole ansatz considered in this paper . in secs .  3 and  4 , we give various exact solutions with scalar hair .",
    "the regularity of our solutions is discussed in sec .",
    "5 . finally",
    ", we conclude in sec .",
    "we consider a shift symmetric subclass of the horndeski theory whose lagrangian is given by @xmath8,\\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are arbitrary functions of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the most general shift symmetric scalar - tensor theory with second - order field equations can accommodate two more arbitrary functions of @xmath11 , often denoted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the literature .",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to the theory possessing reflection symmetry as well , @xmath1 , which forbids the @xmath15 and @xmath16 terms .",
    "we thus focus on the lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian ] ) describing the scalar - tensor theory with shift and reflection symmetries .",
    "since @xmath17 up to a total divergence , we notice that the theory considered in refs .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the specific case with @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are constant parameters .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for black hole solutions of the theory  ( [ babitheory ] ) in the presence of an electromagnetic field . ) in this paper , we go beyond the specific theory  ( [ babitheory ] ) , leaving @xmath21 and @xmath22 arbitrary . as shown in the following , exact black hole solutions with a nontrivial configuration of @xmath4",
    "can still be constructed .",
    "variation with respect to the metric yields the gravitational field equations , @xmath23 shift symmetry of the theory allows us to write the scalar - field equation of motion as a current conservation equation , @xmath24 where @xmath25\\nabla^\\mu\\phi \\nonumber\\\\ & & -2g_{4xx}\\left(\\box\\phi\\nabla^\\mu x-\\nabla^\\mu\\nabla^\\nu\\phi\\nabla_\\nu x\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the metric we are going to study is of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the metric of a unit two - dimensional sphere , plane , or hyperboloid for @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "we take the following @xmath29-dependent ansatz for the scalar field  @xcite , @xmath30 for which @xmath31 \\label{x - psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is , however , independent of @xmath29 . here and hereafter a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath32 . since @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the functions of @xmath11 only , it is more convenient to use @xmath11 rather than @xmath33 when writing the field equations .",
    "note in passing that , if @xmath34 , @xmath35 can be chosen arbitrarily by rescaling the time coordinate : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 with constant @xmath39 .",
    "this rescaling keeps the line element and @xmath11 invariant .",
    "we will closely follow ref .",
    "@xcite to construct black hole solutions dressed with a time - dependent scalar , @xmath34 .",

    "the final form of the solution is thus @xmath75 this is identical to the black hole metric in the presence of the ( effective ) cosmological constant @xmath76 , though it exhibits a nontrivial profile of @xmath77 .",

    "this issue will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : regularity ] .",
    "however , we would emphasize here that the action depends on the derivatives of the scalar field rather than @xmath4 itself , and we see that the coordinate scalar quantities constructed from derivatives , such as @xmath11 and @xmath84 , are regular everywhere .",
    "since the de sitter - schwarzschild metric solves the field equations as shown above , one can consider its extremal limit , _",
