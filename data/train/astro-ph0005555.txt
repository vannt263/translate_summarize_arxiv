    "the redshift - metallicity relation of qso absorption systems is a fundamental probe of the chemical evolution of the universe .",
    "the study of such relation in damped lyman @xmath0 ( dla ) systems(hi ) @xmath5 atoms @xmath6 are called damped lyman @xmath0 systems owing to the presence of radiative damping wings in their lyman @xmath0 absorption profiles . ] probes , in particular , the metal enrichment of the associated galaxies located at cosmological distances along the qso line of sight ( lu et al .",
    "abundance studies of dla systems can be used to trace the chemical evolution of galaxies in the early universe , starting from the redshifts of the most distant qsos .",
    "abundance determinations for different elements are presently available for about 60 dla systems , but the study of their redshift evolution is hampered by two main difficulties .",
    "one is the uncertainty of the abundance measurements owing to the possible effects of dust depletion .",
    "the other is the limited redshift coverage of the sample , which is not always adequate for probing the presence of evolution .",
    "one approach to tackle the first difficulty is to correct the observed abundances for dust depletion effects ( vladilo 1998 , savaglio et al .",
    "another approach is to use an element unaffected by dust depletion as a tracer of metallicity evolution ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "zinc is known to have little affinity with dust since it is essentially undepleted in the interstellar medium ( roth & blades 1995 ) .",
    "abundance measurements in galactic metal - poor stars yield [ zn / fe ] = log @xmath7(x)/@xmath7(y ) @xmath8 log ( x / y)@xmath9 @xmath10 ( sneden , gratton & crocker 1991 ) , suggesting that zinc is a good tracer of iron .",
    "the quality of available stellar data leaves open the possibility that new , more precise measurements may reveal small deviations of [ zn / fe ] from the solar ratio such as those found for the iron - peak elements cr , mn and co ( ryan , norris & beers 1996 ) .",
    "however , even in this case , zinc would still be a good indicator of metallicity , even if not a perfect tracer of fe .",
    "studies of zinc abundances in dla systems have not revealed evidence for evolution of the column - density weighted [ zn / h ] metallicity ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "one difficulty in detecting evolution is the lack of measurements at @xmath1 , when the redshifted znii resonant doublet @xmath11   falls in the reddest part of the visible spectrum .",
    "in addition , the column - density weighted metallicity is more prone to be affected by low number statistics than the unweighted metallicity , as we discuss in section 3 . here",
    "we present the results of a search for redshift evolution performed by considering both the unweighted and the weighted metallicities ( sections 2 and 3 , respectively ) and based on the sample of [ zn / h ] literature data , which includes now our recent measurement at @xmath12 ( molaro et al .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] we show the metallicity [ zn / h ] in dla systems derived from the znii and hi column density determinations currently available in literature .",
    "references to the original works are indicated in the figure caption .",
    "the uves measurement of the @xmath13 system in qso 0000 - 26 is the big circle at the right bottom of the figure .",
    "when necessary , the zinc column densities were redetermined by using the oscillator strengths by bergeson & lawler ( 1993 ) which are adopted for the full sample .",
    "the meteoritic abundance by number @xmath14 ( grevesse , noels & sauval 1996 ) was adopted in all cases as a solar reference value .",
    "the error bars shown in the figure were derived by error propagation of the znii and hi column density errors quoted by the authors and of the meteoritic abundance error .",
    "no systematic differences appear to be present between the znii column densities obtained from 4-m class telescopes ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 , 1999 ) and those measured with the keck telescope ( e.g. lu et al .",
    "1996 , prochaska & wolfe 1996 , 1997 , 1999 ) . in the few cases when a re - determination of the same zn ii column density with higher resolution and signal - to - noise ratio is available",
    "the difference is well within the observational errors quoted by the authors .",
    "the reason for this is probably the weak degree of saturation of the znii doublet which allows accurate column densities to be determined even with spectra of modest resolution and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we believe therefore that the data sample shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is sufficiently homogeneous to perform a statistical analysis .    since the dependence of [ zn / h ] as a function of @xmath15",
    "is not known a priori , we first performed a non parametric correlation analysis by means of kendall s @xmath16 using routine kendl1 of press et al .",
    "we obtain evidence for rank reversal ( @xmath17 ) ,  i.e. evidence for anti - correlation  at 97.2% confidence level .",
    "we then performed a least square linear regression through the \\{@xmath18 , [ zn / h ] } data points and obtained an anti - correlation with slope @xmath19 and intercept @xmath20 .",
    "student s t tests indicate that the slope and the intercept differ from zero at 98.7% and 92.0% confidence level , respectively .",
    "the linear regression results are confirmed by a bootstrap analysis with 10,000 samples , which yields a mean slope @xmath21 and a mean intercept @xmath22 .    while the evidence for anti - correlation is quite robust ,",
    "the data show a scatter larger than the typical measurement errors .",
    "the scatter is still above the individual errors even considering only the keck sub - sample .",
    "therefore the dispersion is genuine and not due to inhomogeneity of the data .",
    "an intrinsic scatter is expected if dla systems are associated with galaxies of different types and different chemical evolution histories .",
    "an additional source of scatter is the random galactocentric distances of the gas intercepted , in the presence of metallicity gradients .",
    "the influence of intrinsic scatter is a matter of concern in performing the ordinary least squares regression on the data .",
    "therefore we re - analysed the data sample with the bces method of akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) which is ideally suited to cope with this situation .",
    "we find a slope @xmath23 and an intercept @xmath24 .",
    "the mean slope and intercept of 10,000 bootstrap samples analysed with the bces method are @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the bces results confirm , within the errors , the parameters derived from the ordinary linear regression analysis .    albeit small , zinc shows some dust depletion which may affect the above analysis . in the galactic ism , the typical zinc depletion is @xmath27 @xmath28 dex ( roth & blades 1995 ) , while in dla systems is @xmath29 dex owing to the modest dust - to - gas ratios typical of these absorbers ( vladilo 1998 ) .",
    "the intercept of the linear regressions that we find may be therefore underestimated by @xmath30 0.2 dex ( probably @xmath27 0.1 dex ) , a systematic error which is still within the statistical errors . as far as the slope is concerned , we may expect an increase of its absolute value ( i.e. a steepening of the anti - correlation ) as a consequence of correcting for dust depletion .",
    "the reason for this is that dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity are correlated in dla systems ( vladilo 1998 ) and we may expect a negligible correction at high redshift , where the metallicity is low , but a non negligible correction at low redshift , where the metallicity rises . in the most extreme case",
    "( i.e. when we consider the depletion completely negligible at @xmath31 and we apply a ism correction of @xmath32 dex at @xmath33 ) we estimate that @xmath34 would increase by about 0.06 dex .",
    "the real systematic error is probably smaller and hence well within the statistical errors of the slope .",
    "the analysis performed in the previous section is appropriate to study the evolution of metals in individual systems .",
    "however , in order to estimate the mean cosmic metallicity of the neutral gas in the universe , the abundance of each dla system has to be weighted by its hi column density ( pei & fall 1995 , pettini et al .",
    "it is easy to show that this is equivalent to compute the expression @xmath35 where the sums are extended to the dla systems in a given redshift bin .",
    "the mean cosmic metallicity @xmath4 is useful for probing models of cosmic chemical evolution ( pei & fall 1995 ) , but it is particularly affected by low - number statistics .",
    "in fact , not only the number of systems available in each redshift bin is limited but , in addition , only the few of them with the highest @xmath7(hi ) give a significant contribution to @xmath4 .",
    "we estimated @xmath4 in 4 redshift bins . rather than adopting bins of constant redshift width",
    ", we binned 4 groups of dla systems with adjacent redshifts , each group with comparable value of @xmath36 and hence comparable statistical significance .",
    "we then determined the effective redshift of each bin with the expression @xmath37 / \\sum_i   n({\\rm h\\,i})_i $ ] .",
    "the resulting 4 data points are shown as filled diamonds in fig .",
    "the error bars of @xmath4 are estimated according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) by pettini et al . (",
    ". a quick look at the figure does not show evidence for metallicity evolution .",
    "this result is confirmed by a regression analysis of the \\{@xmath38 } data points , which yields @xmath39 . this slope is lower than the one derived from the analysis of individual dla systems and differs from zero only at 79% confidence level .",
    "we find evidence for an anti - correlation between the absolute zinc abundance [ zn / h ] and the absorption redshift @xmath18 of dla systems , with a slope @xmath40 in the range @xmath3 .",
    "the zinc metallicity increases from @xmath41 up to @xmath42 of the solar value from @xmath43 to @xmath44 . should dla absorbers continue the same trend also from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , the typical present - day metallicity would be @xmath46 solar , even though a value as high as @xmath47 is still within the errors of the intercept . correcting for dust depletion effects would slightly steepen the anti - correlation , but well within the statistical error of the slope ; the characteristic present - day metallicity would rise up to @xmath48 solar , with values as high as @xmath49 solar still within the errors .",
    "the slope of the metallicity redshift relation that we derive is in good agreement with the value recently derived by savaglio et al .",
    "the literature data base considered by these authors is larger than ours and includes different elements in addition to zinc .",
    "however , most of these elements are known to be severely depleted into dust in the ism and the results by savaglio et al . are based on an algorithm that corrects the abundances for depletion effects .",
    "the present results do not require a modeling of the elemental depletion patterns nor assumptions on the intrinsic abundance patterns in dla systems .    in spite of the correlation with redshift , the zinc metallicities show evidence for intrinsic scatter .",
    "models of galactic chemical evolution have already been able to explain such scatter by considering the surface brightness and the formation redshift of the galaxies , as well as the galactocentric distance of the gas intercepted ( jimnez , bowen & matteucci 1999 ) .",
    "while such analysis has shown a general consistency between the zinc observations and the predicted evolutionary tracks , the present results demonstrate for the first time the evolution of zinc metallicity on pure observational grounds .",
    "while we find evolution of the zinc metallicity of individual systems , we do not find evolution of the column - density weighted metallicity @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of previous studies by pettini et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the lack of evolution of the zinc mean cosmic metallicity might be due , at least in part , to the lack of a sufficiently large data base , since the measurement of @xmath4 is extremely sensitive to low number statistics . however , there are also reasons to believe that @xmath4 is affected by some selection bias . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we use different symbols for the systems with @xmath7(hi ) @xmath50 @xmath6 ( empty squares ) and @xmath7(hi ) @xmath51 @xmath6 ( empty circles ) .",
    "one can see from the figure that the systems with high column density have , in general , low metallicity  an effect originally pointed out by boiss et al .",
    "high column density systems are the main contributors to @xmath4 and the lack of such absorbers with [ zn / h ] @xmath52 at low @xmath15 tends to hide the global rise of metallicity with cosmic time .",
    "the lack of dla systems of high column density and metallicity at low redshift is somewhat surprising because ( i ) clouds with @xmath7(hi ) @xmath50 atoms @xmath6 and high metallicity do exist in the disk of our galaxy and in low redshift spirals ; ( ii ) study of the hi content of the local universe suggest that spirals should be the main contributors to the dla population at @xmath53 ( rao & briggs 1993 ) .",
    "nevertheless , spirals are a small fraction of the intervening dla galaxies observed in low-@xmath15 imaging studies ( le brun et al . 1997 ; rao & turnshek 1998 ; see also refs . in table 1 by vladilo 1999 ) .",
    "this deficiency of spirals suggests the presence of some selection effect .",
    "selection effects that can bias the observed population of dla absorbers include qso obscuration by dla dust ( fall & pei 1993 ) and gravitational lensing ( smette , claeskens & surdej 1997 ) .",
    "however , also the surface brightness of the intervening galaxies and the galactocentric distances of the clouds intercepted can play a role in affecting the observed population . as discussed in vladilo ( 1999 )",
    ", these effects generally conspire to decrease the fraction of chemical enriched regions in the sample population , dust obscuration alone yielding a qso visual extinction of @xmath54 magnitude when @xmath7(hi ) @xmath55 @xmath6 at solar metallicity . considering the likely presence of this bias and the severe dependence of @xmath4 on low number statistics ,",
    "the lack of evolution of @xmath4 should not be used to conclude that the mean cosmic metallicity of dla absorbers does not evolve .",
    "comparison between empirical @xmath4 determinations and model predictions of global enrichment of the universe should await a better understanding of the role played by any selection bias and a significant enlargement of the observational data base .",
