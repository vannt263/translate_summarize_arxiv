    "the star forming region is older , as suggested by the appearance of the accretion stars .",
    "however , the number of accretion stars depends strongly on the abundance of binary stars and the mass transfer via the lagrange point l@xmath59 with roche lobe overflow. since the correct handling of the binary star evolution is not clear , this effect is not taken into account by stars .",

    "agb stars appear at a similar location as red giants in the hr - diagram , and the progenitor stars are more massive .",
    "this means that these stars reach their location in the hrd much earlier .",
    "modeling of the agb phase at the tip of the giant branch just before the transition to a planetary nebula is difficult , since the stars change their luminosity , effective temperature and chemical composition .",
    "nir observations show that agb stars can change their effective temperatures by 500  k and their luminosities by 25% within short time - scales ( lancon 1999 ) .",
