    "measurements of branching fractions and other related observables in semileptonic decays of @xmath5 meson to @xmath4 can be interesting for an indirect probe of np .",
    "earlier measurements on @xmath6 by belle @xcite and babar collaborations @xcite have shown some deviations from their standard model(sm ) predictions @xcite , indicating a possible signature of np in @xmath7 transitions .",
    "several authors have tried to explain the observation in various np scenarios @xcite , as well as in a model - independent way @xcite . in order to distinguish between the possible signatures of np , the study of np in @xmath1 distribution of differential branching fractions in @xmath0 , various correlations among @xmath4 forward - backward asymmetry and",
    "@xmath4 polarization asymmetry has been examined in the ref .",
    "recently , a 2.1@xmath8 deviation in the measurement of @xmath9 has been reported by lhcb collaboration @xcite ; belle collaboration has also announced their most recent results on @xmath10 and measured values are consistent with the sm within error bars @xcite .",
    "so far , the constraints on the new couplings are obtained assuming their presence one at a time @xcite .",
    "if we consider all the interactions together , then it will be an impossible task to extract all the couplings from a single measurement .",
    "however , if one can reduce the number of coupling parameters by imposing certain constraints on the full set of parameters , only then it is possible to obtain meaningful errors on the couplings , although the information lost due to various assumptions can not be retrieved .",
    "therefore , it will be useful to have independent couplings , parametrised in such a way that the measured errors on different parameters are uncorrelated .",
    "on the other hand , it is not necessary for a particular observable to have equal sensitivity to different types of np operators . therefore , it is useful to know how an observable can be optimised to guarantee the maximal sensitivity to a particular type of np interaction , which in turn will help us select observables suitable for the extraction of a particular type of coupling . hence , from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", it is important to find out the significance of different types of np interaction , to an observable . to achieve this goal",
    ", we use the optimal - observable analysis using the invariant mass squared @xmath1 , of the lepton - neutrino system .",
    "we construct the optimal observable to identify the np structure that can be best extracted from a particular observable , with reasonable statistics .",
    "it also provides a deeper understanding of the sensitivity that can be best obtained by any method , for a certain process .",
    "this technique has been widely used in collider phenomenology @xcite .    in this article , we analyse the @xmath1 distribution of the differential branching fractions , @xmath10 , the @xmath4 polarisation asymmetries , forward backward asymmetries of the decay @xmath0 , and @xmath11 polarisation asymmetry .",
    "we include all possible non - standard four - fermi effective interactions of the lowest dimension , and estimate the expected statistical uncertainties in the extraction of various np wilson coefficients that can contribute to @xmath0 .",
    "the most general effective hamiltonian describing the @xmath12 transitions with all possible four - fermi operators in the lowest dimension is given by @xcite @xmath13 ,   \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operator basis is defined as _",
    "v_1 & = & ( |c_l ^b_l)(|_l _ _ l ) ,   o_v_2 = ( |c_r ^b_r)(|_l _ _ l ) , + o_s_1 & = & ( |c_l b_r)(|_r _ l ) ,   o_s_2 = ( |c_r b_l)(|_r _ l ) , + o_t & = & ( |c_r ^ b_l)(|_r _ _ l ) , [ eq2 ] and the corresponding wilson coefficients are given by @xmath14 . in this basis , neutrinos are assumed to be left handed .",
    "our main focus is on the @xmath1 distribution of differential decay rate @xmath15 in @xmath0 .",
    "the complete expressions are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the optimal - observable analysis is a technique to systematically estimate the statistical uncertainties of the measurable parameters while extracting them from some observable .",
    "elaborate discussions on this technique can be found in references @xcite . in order to apply this technique to @xmath0 ,",
    "it is necessary to express the @xmath1 distribution of the differential decay rate as = _",

    "the theoretical expressions for @xmath16s , along with the @xmath18s , can be extracted from a direct comparison between the similar terms on both sides of eq.([eq3 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 , relevant for the branching fractions in @xmath0 , are given in table [ cird ] , and the corresponding @xmath18s are given in the appendix ( table [ fisrd ] ) .",
