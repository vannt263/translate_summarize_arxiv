    "quantum control techniques like hamiltonian engineering are very successful when manipulating finite - dimensional hilbert spaces @xcite",
    ". however , quantum control tasks often require the control of an infinite - dimensional state space .",
    "this applies for example , when the quantum system of interest couples to an infinitely large reservoir or when it contains bosonic modes with infinitely many states .",
    "in such a situation one should take advantage of mechanisms which restrict the time evolution of the system effectively onto a finite - dimensional space .",
    "the corresponding evolution can then be used to engineer appropriate control sequences @xcite .    the protection of finite - dimensional subspaces against the leakage of population ( cf .",
    "[ tony_0 ] ) can be achieved in many different ways .",
    "one approach is to use hamiltonians which act only on small subsets of states and naturally restrict the time evolution of the system onto a finite - dimensional state space .",
    "this technique is used for example in ion trap quantum computing , where gate operations are realised by applying the required interactions in successive steps @xcite . during each time step , the number of phonons in the system increases at most by one .",
    "the populated state space remains finite and the excitation of coherent phonon states has been avoided . at the end of every control sequence ,",
    "the ions return into a state with zero phonon excitation @xcite .",
    "another very efficient tool for the protection of subspaces against leakage errors are stimulated raman adiabatic passages ( stirap ) @xcite .",
    "these employ the adiabatic theorem to induce transitions between states with no direct coupling between them . in composite quantum systems , like atoms which move slowly through an optical cavity",
    ", stirap can create ground state entanglement without populating excited electronic states and without creating photons inside the resonator @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach for protecting subspaces against leakage errors is to use especially designed impulsive pulse sequences .",
    "this technique has initially been developed to minimise radiation damage when exciting specific ground - state vibrational modes of molecules @xcite .",
    "a generalisation of both strategies is to simply use numerical simulations which impose state dependent constraints to design optimal control sequences @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a very different strategy for protecting the controlled subspace against leakage .",
    "instead of imposing a well designed dynamics onto its states , we consider strong interactions which act _ only _ on the outside .",
    "if these interactions introduce a time scale into the system which is much shorter than the time scale on which the leakage of population out of the controlled subspace would occur in the unprotected case , one can show that these unwanted transitions become strongly inhibited @xcite .",
    "this approach has many similarities with bang - bang and its generalisation dynamical decoupling @xcite which also interrupt a relatively slow evolution with strong interactions .",
    "the second half of the paper pays special attention to the constructive use of dissipation in the protection of subspaces against population leakage and assumes non - zero spontaneous decay rates of the outside states .",
    "we are interested in cases , where the time evolution of the system can be understood in terms of rapidly - repeated measurements whether the system remains in the controlled subspace or not @xcite .",
    "these force the system to remain there much longer than in the unprotected case which can be understood in terms of the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "notice that this approach provides a build - in error detection mechanism , when it is possible to register and act upon unwanted measurement outcomes .",
    "moreover , as we shall see below , dissipation can protect subspaces against leakage errors even in situations , where other methods would simply fail .",
    "@xcite discuss similarities between bang - bang , dynamical decoupling , the protection of subspaces with strong interactions , and the protection of subspaces using dissipation .",
    "the authors conclude that all these approaches are essentially equivalent , since all of them can be understood in terms of the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present manuscript is to give more insight into the underlying processes .",
    "this is done by analysing relatively simple toy models which allow us to compare the above mentioned methods qualitatively as well as quantitatively .",
    "this paper is organized in five sections . in the next section ,",
    "we consider a two - level system with resonant coherent coupling to obtain information about the expected leakage rates in a simple unprotected subspace scenario . in section [ pro1 ] , we extend the outside space and show how strong interactions acting on the outside space can be used ( or how they should not be used ) to protect the controlled subspace against leakage error .",
    "section [ dissi ] analyses closely related level schemes but with non - zero spontaneous decay rates .",
    "an example is given where dissipation results in the protection of a subspace which would not be there otherwise .",
    "we finally summarise our findings in section [ conc ] .",
    "let us first consider a case where no effort is made to protect a controlled subspace from leaking population into outside states . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the controlled subspace contains only a single state @xmath0 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ tony_1 ] , there is moreover only one relevant state outside the controlled subspace which we denote by @xmath1 .",
    "the leakage of population from level 0 into level 1 could be due to resonant interactions ( like a laser field ) .",
    "although this is an almost trivial case , the analysis of the time evolution of this level scheme introduces the relevant time scales of the system .",
    "this will enable us later to characterise and to compare the effectiveness of different strategies for the protection of controlled subspaces against leakage errors .    in the following , we assume that the laser is in resonance with the 01 transition and denote its ( real ) rabi frequency by @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 denotes the energy of states @xmath4 .",
    "then the system hamiltonian in the usual rotating wave and dipole approximation can be written as @xmath5 with @xmath6 . to solve the corresponding time evolution , we first change into an the interaction picture with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "this transfers the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) into the interaction hamiltonian @xmath8 to estimate the leakage rate of the controlled subspace in this case , we now calculate the population @xmath9 in @xmath0 at time @xmath10 , given that the system was initially in @xmath0 .    one way of doing this is to consider the usual pauli operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and to use the relation",
    "@xmath14 \\right \\rangle \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the time evolution of the expectation value of an operator @xmath15 in the interaction picture to obtain a closed set of rate equations .",
    "this yields the differential equations @xmath16 which can be solved easily analytically .    a more straightforward way of solving the time evolution of the system is to write its state vector as @xmath17 and to use the schrdinger equation to obtain differential equations for the complex coefficients @xmath18 .",
    "however , the above approach of deriving rate equations for expectation values is more efficient , since we are only interested in the leakage of population out of the controlled subspace .",
    "moreover , this approach can be extended easily to include more complex level schemes as well as the effect of spontaneous photon emission .",
    "since @xmath12 commutes with @xmath19 , we can calculate @xmath9 using the relation @xmath20 solving eq .",
    "( [ rateq ] ) for time - independent coupling constants @xmath2 and for the case where the system is initially in @xmath0 , we find that the population in the initial state changes according to @xmath21 this means , in the absence of any protection , the system remains inside the controlled subspace only on a time scale which is short compared to @xmath22 .",
    "one way to protect the controlled subspace against errors is to involve the relevant outside states into a relatively fast time evolution .",
    "indeed it has been found that strong interactions can have the same effect as rapidly repeated measurements whether the system remains in its initial subspace or not @xcite . in good agreement with the predictions of the quantum zeno effect @xcite , these measurements strongly inhibit transitions out of the controlled subspace . in the following ,",
    "we illustrate this approach with the help of the two toy models shown in fig .",
    "[ tony_2 ] .",
    "the purpose of the interactions with amplitude @xmath23 is to induce fast oscillations of the amplitude of the state @xmath1 .",
    "these cause @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ defq ] ) to oscillate rapidly in time , such that @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ rateq ] ) becomes zero on average and the system remains approximately in @xmath0 .",
    "as we shall see below , this strategy works well for the level scheme in fig .",
    "[ tony_2](a ) .",
    "however , strong interactions acting on the outside space do not always protect the controlled subspace against leakage errors .",
    "problems arise for example in the level scheme in fig .",
    "[ tony_2](b ) .",
    "there the interactions in the outside space are more complex than the interactions which cause the leakage .",
    "the result is that the generation of approximate dark states in the outside space .",
    "these are zero eigenvectors of the fast system dynamics .",
    "transitions between dark states and the controlled subspace are hence not protected by time scale separation , even when @xmath23 becomes very large .",
    "we begin with an analysis of the three - level system shown in fig .",
    "[ tony_2](a ) .",
    "again , the controlled subspace contains only a single state , @xmath0 , while the outside subspace contains the two states @xmath1 and @xmath26 . in order to maximise the effect of the applied interactions , we assume resonant couplings . as before",
    ", @xmath2 is the coupling constant for the 01 transition , while @xmath23 denotes the coupling constant for the 12 transition .",
    "here we are especially interested in the case , where @xmath27 .",
    "again we have a closer look at the time evolution of the population @xmath9 in the controlled subspace .    as in section [ unpro ]",
    ", we denote the energy of level @xmath28 by @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the level configuration in fig .",
    "[ tony_2](a ) can then be written as @xmath29 with @xmath6 and @xmath30 . transforming this hamiltonian into the interaction picture with respect to @xmath31",

    "we now consider the expectation values of the gell - mann matrices @xcite @xmath33 these are generalisations of the pauli operators used in section [ unpro ] .",
    "overall there are eight gell - mann matrices which can be used to model the time evolution of coupled three - level systems in a convenient way .",
