    "thermal fluctuations in an equilibrium isotropic fluid always give rise to short - range equal - time correlation functions , except close to a critical point .",
    "however , when external gradients are applied , equal - time correlation functions may develop long - range contributions , whose nature is very different from those in equilibrium . for a variety of systems in nonequilibrium states",
    "it has been shown theoretically that the existence of the so called generic scale invariance is the origin of the long range nature of the correlation functions , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for instance , for a simple fluid under a thermal gradient its structure factor , which determines the intensity of the rayleigh scattering , diverges as @xmath0 for small values of the wave number @xmath1 .",
    "this dependence amounts to an algebraic decay of the density - density correlation function , a feature that has been verified experimentally @xcite , @xcite .    although studies of the behavior of fluctuations in nematic liquid crystals about nonequilibrium states are more scarce , some specific examples have been studied theoretically .",
    "such is the case of the nonequilibrium situations generated by a static temperature gradient @xcite , a stationary shear flow @xcite or by an externally imposed constant pressure gradient @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the first two cases it was found that the nonequilibrium contributions to the corresponding light scattering spectrum were small , but in the case of a poiseuille flow induced by an external pressure gradient the effect may be quite large . to our knowledge",
    ", however , at present there is no experimental confirmation of these effects , in spite of the fact that for nematics the scattered intensity is several orders of magnitude larger than for ordinary simple fluids @xcite .    in this work",
    "we present a model calculation based on a fluctuating hydrodynamic description with a time - scale perturbation formalism to calculate analytically the equal - time correlation functions of  the transverse and longitudinal orientation components of a thermotropic nematic liquid crystal .",
    "we derive the explicitly space dependence of these quantities and show that they exhibit long - range order not only in equilibrium , but also in the nonequilibrium state induced when the liquid is subjected to a heat flux induced by a stationary thermal gradient .",
    "we also evaluate the effect of the thermal gradient on the dynamic structure factor of the fluid . however , since to our knowledge there are no experimental results available in the literature for light scattering from a nematic in this steady states , to estimate the predictions of our model we used experimental parameter values similar to those used in light scattering experiments for an isotropic simple fluid . in this way the effect of this long - range behavior on the dynamic structure factor of the fluid is examined for a geometry used in light scattering experiments .",
    "we find that the external gradient introduces an asymmetry of the spectrum shifting its maximum towards negative frequency intervals by an amount proportional to the magnitude of the gradient which may be of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "also , the width at half height may decrease by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "consider a thermotropic nematic liquid crystal layer of thickness @xmath4 confined between two parallel plates maintained at the uniform temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , in a homeotropic arrangement as depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the transverse dimensions of the cell along the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions are large compared to @xmath4 .",
    "the hydrodynamic state of the nematic is specified by the velocity field , @xmath9 , the unit vector defining the local symmetry axis ( director field ) , @xmath10 , the pressure , @xmath11 and the temperature , @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the nematic has reached a stationary state characterized by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , without convection , e.g. , @xmath16 . by symmetry @xmath14 and @xmath13 may only depend on @xmath17 and if we neglect the variation of thermal conductivity with @xmath17 ,  the stationary state is defined by the solution of the equations for @xmath14 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are obtained from the general nematodynamic equations for this geometry , see appendix in ref . @xcite . as a result",
    ", a linear stationary temperature profile is established in the cell , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the inset shows the scattering geometry.the scattering angle is @xmath24 . ]",
    "we want to describe the dynamics of the spontaneous thermal ( hydrodynamic ) fluctuations , @xmath25 , etc , around this stationary state .",
    "a complete set of stochastic equations for the space - time evolution of these fluctuations is obtained by linearizing the general hydrodynamic equations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and by using the fluctuating hydrodynamics formalism of landau and lifshitz @xcite . in this work",
    "we will only calculate correlation functions in the bulk of the nematic , that is , for points @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath17 and @xmath28 far away from the boundaries , which means , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , since the cartesian components of the director and velocity fields turn out to be strongly coupled , it will be convenient to work in a representation where this coupling is minimum .",
    "this is accomplished by defining the transverse component of the director fluctuating field as its projection along the perpendicular direction to the @xmath31 plane , i.e. , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and the upper tilde denotes the space - fourier transform of fields .",
    "similarly , the longitudinal component , @xmath34 , is its projection in the @xmath35 plane .    in previous work",
    "we have shown that for a thermotropic nematic the modes associated with the director relaxation are much slower than the visco - heat and sound modes @xcite . for typical material parameter values of a thermotropic nematic",
    "the ratio of these relaxation times is @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , transverse and longitudinal director fluctuations relax to equilibrium much more slowly than fluctuations in temperature , pressure and velocity fields .",
    "actually , the existence of widely separated time - scales may be exploited to eliminate the fast variables from the general dynamic equations obtaining a reduced description in which only the slow variables are involved . the time scaling perturbation method introduced by geigenmller et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite may be implemented in order  to diminish the couplings between nematodynamic fluctuations .",
    "it allows us to find , on the slow time - scales , a contracted description in terms of the slow variables only with a reduced dynamic matrix which can be constructed by a perturbation procedure .    by using this method",
    "it can be shown that in the slow time - scale , director fluctuations @xmath37 and @xmath38 obey the stochastic equations @xcite,@xmath39where we have introduced the following abbreviations@xmath40 ,   \\label{11}\\]]@xmath41 ^{2}}{\\nu _ { 3}k_{\\perp } ^{4}+2\\left ( \\nu _ { 1}+\\nu _ { 2}-\\nu _ { 3}\\right ) k_{\\perp } ^{2}k_{z}^{2}+\\nu _ { 3}k_{z}^{4}}\\right\\ } .",

    "the stochastic components of the quasi - current of director field and the stress tensor , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , are zero averaged @xmath56 and in equilibrium they satisfy the fluctuation dissipation relations @xcite@xmath57@xmath58where @xmath59 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath60 is the equilibrium temperature of the nematic , @xmath61 is a projection operator and @xmath62 is the viscous tensor as given in ref .",
