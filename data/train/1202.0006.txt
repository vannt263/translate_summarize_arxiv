    "holography has recently been used to model superconductors ( scs ) @xcite with the hope that it may shed light on the nature of high temperature superconductors , which evade the weakly coupled paradigm of bcs theory .",
    "the application of holography to superfluids / superconductors relies on considering a strongly coupled @xmath5-dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) admitting a gravity dual and in which a global / local u(1 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vev of some charged operator @xmath6 .",
    "the gravity dual description is composed of @xmath7-dimensional anti de sitter ( ads ) gravity with a u(1 ) gauge field and a charged scalar field @xmath8 dual to @xmath6 which develops a u(1)-breaking condensate .    in the simplest concrete realization @xcite ,",
    "the cft lives in a homogeneous @xmath9-dimensional ` plane ' at a finite temperature @xmath10 . at high enough temperature",
    ", the ground state corresponds to the reissner - nordstrom ads planar black brane ( or ` bb ' for short ) , corresponding to the cft being in a deconfined plasma state . at low temperatures a hairy bb with a nonzero smooth profile for @xmath8 around the horizon",
    "is energetically favored and thus the superconducting state arises . since the bb exhibits a finite conductivity , this realizes the superconducting transition in a material which otherwise is a _",
    "conductor_.    even more interestingly , the holographic duality successfully overcomes the challenge to describe _ insulating _ materials that display superconductivity at low enough temperatures , like , remarkably , the cuprate high temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "as first discussed in @xcite , the _ ads soliton _ @xcite geometry precisely realizes this kind of materials .",
    "indeed , the spectrum of fluctuations over the ads soliton has a ( roughly temperature - independent ) mass gap , signaling an insulating behavior  which can also be viewed as a confining vacuum state .",
    "moreover , the geometry lacks any horizons so heuristically one does not expect any obstruction ( other than the gap itself ) that these geometries develop hairs .",
    "indeed , a large enough u(1 ) chemical potential @xmath11 eventually overcomes the mass gap associated with @xmath8 , and it becomes energetically favorable for @xmath8 to condense near the infrared tip of the geometry . overcoming a certain gap .",
    "the main difference is that for the conductor conformal invariance forces this gap to be proportional to the temperature . ]",
    "these encouraging findings motivate us to continue a systematic study of this holographic insulator ( the ads soliton ) and its superconductor phase ( the ads soliton superconductor or ` soliton sc ' for short ) .",
    "specifically , in this work we shall study the impact of external magnetic fields on such holographic ` materials ' .",
    "this will include in particular the response of cylindrical materials under a threading magnetic flux . as an additional motivation ,",
    "let us point out that recently there have been discussions in the condensed matter literature on the response to such a flux , which should undergo a periodicity change for small enough cylinder radii @xcite .",
    "our results are perfectly in tune with these conclusions .    the first important fact",
    "to notice about the holographic insulator model is that inevitably one of the spatial directions of the material must be compactified on a circle  because the ads soliton asymptotics include one compact direction .",
    "in fact , this is how the mass gap is generated in the cft : by compactifying it on a circle with appropriate boundary conditions .    [",

    "we have solved equations ( [ mnansatz ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ mnbc1 ] , [ mnbc2 ] ) for the cases ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 .",
    "notice that these solutions would be `` gauge equivalent '' if the relevant gauge transformation was not broken . in fig .",
    "[ mnvortex ] we show the order parameter @xmath20 and the current @xmath21 as a function of @xmath22 , for both cases .",
    "as predicted before , the profiles of our observables are indeed sensitive to the topological sector where the vortex is defined , showing a clear signal of the uplifting of the degeneracy among the topological sectors . in other words vortices in the solitonic background",
    "can tell , in which sector they sit on while bb vortices can not .",
    "in this paper we have studied the magnetic response of holographic superconductors which in the normal phase are insulators .",
    "these materials can be obtained by compactifying a cft to a cylinder , which is dual to the ads soliton in the gravity side .",
    "we have studied separately the response to a wilson line on the circle and to a magnetic field perpendicular to the non - compact directions . continuing the analysis of @xcite",
    ", we have found that the response to the wilson line for holographic conductors and holographic insulators is dramatically different : at leading order in the large @xmath23 ( number of colours ) expansion the aharonov - bohm effects generated by the wilson line are suppressed for the conductor and unsuppressed for the insulator .",
    "the ( un)suppressed aharonov - bohm effects leave a clear signature in the superconductivity phase transition in the form of a different periodicity in the cylinder - threading magnetic flux .",
    "regarding the response to the perpendicular magnetic fields , qualitatively there is no great difference between the two types of materials since both of them respond by creating vortices and are of type ii .",
    "still , we found that for the insulator / superconductor transition the vortices are sensitive to the quantum hair provided by the discrete gauge charge .",
    "we have also elaborated on the fluid mechanical analogue of the problem , that is , the response to rotation of pairing - based superfluids or supersolids in a cylindrical topology .",
    "we concluded similarly that there is an unsuppressed sensitivity to quantum hair ( via the sagnac effect ) in supersolids that manifests in a larger periodicity with respect to the angular frequency of rotation .",
    "our findings agree with the predictions from condensed matter microscopic theories .",
    "recent literature @xcite has discussed how the lp period @xmath24 should be uplifted to the fundamental period @xmath25 when @xmath26 is lowered at least down to the zero - temperature coherence length , @xmath27 .",
    "exactly the same phenomenon occurs in the holographic model @xcite and we also developed an effective field theory description of it .",
    "an interesting benefit of the holographic methods is that , as a ` bonus ' , one obtains the ` prediction ' that the aharonov - bohm effects are generically bigger for materials with an insulator normal phase than for those with conductor normal phase .",
    "one obvious improvement of the present analysis is to include the gravitational back - reaction , which will allow to explore beyond the limit @xmath28 taken here . in practice",
    "what one should do is to introduce a magnetic field and/or a wilson line in the set - up of @xcite , which studied the gravitational backreaction in the holographic superconductor with a compact space - dimension .",
    "let us note that ref .",
    "@xcite appeared recently taking into account the backreaction in a similar model .",
    "however , in ref . @xcite the various fluxoid sectors with @xmath29 are incorrectly treated as gauge - equivalent to @xmath30 , so a proper analysis is still necessary .",
    "we do not expect that this will modify qualitative features such as the suppression of the aharonov - bohm effects in the bb phase .",
    "one can foresee that the phase diagram will be enriched by the superimposition of ( de)confinement transitions between the soliton and bb phases in addition to the superconductivity transitions .",
    "another interesting direction to study is how much quantum correction in the bulk change the picture ( mapping to the @xmath31 corrections in the cft ) , especially in the bb case .",
    "again , one expects only small correction to the present analysis . the present paper can also be generalized ( i ) to extend the holographic josephson junctions of @xcite to superconducting materials with insulating normal phase , which could lead to simple holographic duals to so called superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) junctions , and ( ii ) to describe p - wave holographic superconductors @xcite .",
    "finally , other elaborations such as the inclusion of some fermionic matter could also be useful to make closer contact with real materials .",
    "let us end by emphasizing once more the main result of this work , namely a generic and sharp prediction on superconductivity from holography : the magnetic response of superconductors in the form of aharonov - bohm effects must be bigger for for strongly coupled materials which in the normal phase are insulators than for those which in the normal phase are conductors . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "we ignore if this pattern is already known or if it occurs in known materials . in any case",
    ", it at least offers another means to test the usefulness of the holographic techniques for real - world materials .    * acknowledgments .",
