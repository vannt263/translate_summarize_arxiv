    "chemical master equations ( cmes ) are the accepted mathematical description of chemical systems in well - mixed conditions @xcite .",
    "these equations provide a mesoscopic description of chemical kinetics , interpolating between the microscopic regime of molecular dynamics and the macroscopic regime of rate equations ( res ) .",
    "it has been shown that cmes are exact descriptions for any well - stirred and thermally equilibrated gas - phase chemical system @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been rigorously confirmed that their validity extends to chemical reactions in well - stirred dilute solutions @xcite .",
    "however , well before these rigorous demonstrations of the microscopic physical basis of the cme , scientists have employed these equations to probe the nature of mesoscopic chemical kinetics and in particular to understand how this may differ from kinetics on macroscopic length scales ( see mcquarrie for a review @xcite of the literature up till 1967 ) .",
    "we briefly review the cme formalism . consider a general chemical system consisting of a number @xmath4 of distinct chemical species interacting via @xmath5 elementary chemical reactions of the type : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is an index running from 1 to @xmath5 , @xmath8 denotes chemical species @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the stoichiometric coefficients and @xmath12 is the macroscopic rate of reaction .",
    "if this system is well - mixed then its mesoscopic state is fully determined by the vector of the absolute number of molecules of each species , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of molecules of the @xmath15species .",
    "the cme is then a time - evolution equation for the probability of the system being in a particular mesoscopic state @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath2 is the volume of the compartment in which the reactions occur and @xmath17 is a step operator  when it acts on some function of the absolute number of molecules , it gives back the same function but with @xmath14 replaced by @xmath18 .",
    "the chemical reaction details are encapsulated in the stoichiometric matrix @xmath19 and in the microscopic rate functions @xmath20 .",
    "the probability that the @xmath21 reaction occurs in the time interval @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 .",
    "for elementary reactions , the microscopic rate function takes one of four different forms , depending on the order of the @xmath21 reaction : ( i ) a zeroth - order reaction by which a species is input into a compartment gives @xmath24 ; ( ii ) a first - order unimolecular reaction involving the decay of some species @xmath25 gives @xmath26 ; ( iii ) a second - order bimolecular reaction between two molecules of the same species @xmath25 gives @xmath27 ; ( iii ) a second - order bimolecular reaction between two molecules of different species , @xmath25 and @xmath28 , gives @xmath29 .",
    "the re description of the same system is much simpler . denoting the macroscopic concentration of species @xmath9 by @xmath30 , the set of res describing the macroscopic kinetics of the reactive system represented by eq .",
    "( 1 ) are given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the vector of macroscopic concentrations and @xmath33 is the macroscopic rate function of the @xmath21 reaction which has the general mass - action form , @xmath34 .",
    "res provide a continuous deterministic `` many molecule '' description of kinetics .",
    "this strongly contrasts with the cme description which constitutes a discrete , stochastic , `` any number of molecule '' description that is faithful to the underlying microscopic basis of chemical reactions .",
    "unfortunately , one of the main advantages of cmes over their re cousins , their discrete description , is also the source of their computational intractability .",
    "differential - difference equations , such as the cme @xcite , do not lend themselves easily to analysis .",
    "in contrast , there is a vast body of literature in engineering , mathematics and physics dealing with the analysis and solution of differential and partial differential equations .",
    "thus at an early stage , considerable effort was invested in obtaining a partial differential approximation of the cme . in the 1940 s ,",
    "kramers @xcite and moyal @xcite developed a taylor series expansion of the cme ; by assuming that all terms with derivatives greater than two are negligible , one obtains the chemical fokker - planck equation ( cfpe , @xcite ) , a second - order partial differential equation of the form : @xmath35 as gardiner mentions in his book @xcite , `` this procedure enjoyed wide popularity  mainly because of the convenience and simplicity of the result '' and also because `` it is often simpler to use the fokker - planck equation than the master equation . '' a major and important difference between the cme and the cfpe is that @xmath14 is a positive integer for the cme while it is a real number for the cfpe .",
    "several authors have questioned the validity of the cfpe approximation .",
    "the approximation is obtained by a perfunctory truncation of the taylor expansion and hence it appears to be an uncontrolled and unjustified approximation of the cme .",
    "van kampen , in particular , was a leading and influential critic of the cfpe approximation . in the 1960 s and 70 s , he developed a systematic perturbative expansion of the cme in powers of the inverse square root of the system volume @xmath2 ( the system - size expansion ) and used it to show that to lowest order in the expansion , i.e. in the limit of large volumes  the macroscopic limit , one obtains a fokker - planck equation which is of a different form than the cfpe @xcite .",
    "of particular concern is that van kampen s fokker - planck equation is linear whereas the cfpe is non - linear .",
    "note that by non - linear fokker - planck equation here we mean one such that its drift and diffusion coefficients are generally non - linear functions of the molecule numbers @xmath14 ; this convention is adopted since it is in mainstream use , for example see the book by van kampen @xcite .",
    "taking into account higher - order terms in the system - size expansion does not lead to the cfpe as well .",
    "however , interestingly , in the limit of large volumes , the cfpe does reduce to van kampen s linear fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "this led van kampen to conclude that any features arising from the non - linear character of the cfpe are spurious and not to be taken seriously @xcite .",
    "we note that the limit of large volumes in van kampen s system - size expansion is taken at fixed macroscopic concentrations and hence it corresponds to the limit of large molecule numbers @xcite .",
    "hence van kampen s conclusions can be equivalently stated as : the cfpe becomes a legitimate approximation of the cme in the limit of large molecular populations .",
    "a few studies at the time @xcite did suggest that the cfpe s validity extended beyond the linear regime .",
    "of particular importance is a result of horsthemke and brenig @xcite which motivated the present study .",
    "the authors considered a simple dimerization reaction @xmath36 whereby molecules of a monomer species @xmath37 are introduced in a compartment of volume @xmath2 and subsequently they bind to each other to form dimers @xmath38 . assuming stationary conditions , the cme and cfpe are solved exactly .",
    "it is shown that the average concentration of monomers and the variance of the fluctuations from the two formalisms agree exactly to order @xmath39 and are respectively equal to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the macroscopic concentration obtained by solving the corresponding re in steady - state conditions .",
    "the same example can be found worked in van kampen s book @xcite wherein he shows that the linear noise approximation gives mean and variance equal to @xmath42 and @xmath41 . as we mentioned before",
    ", a linearization of the cfpe will lead to the linear - noise approximation and hence from this example we can conclude that the non - linearity of the cfpe is non - spurious since it leads to a more accurate concentration estimate than that which is obtained from the linear - noise approximation .",
    "however one could argue that this higher accuracy is only particular to the dimerization example and not a general feature of the cfpe .",
    "because of this or other reasons , the results of hortshemke and brenig do not appear to have received the attention they deserved at the time and van kampen s conclusions about the cfpe were accepted , by and large , by the statistical physics community .",
    "approximately 40 years later after the inception of the system - size expansion , gillespie revived the question of the validity of the cfpe by deriving it without invoking truncation of the kramers - moyal expansion of the cme @xcite . to be precise , he derived the chemical langevin equation ( cle ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 are temporally uncorrelated , independent gaussian white noises . this stochastic differential equation is exactly equivalent to the cfpe in the sense that its solution generates exact sample paths of the cfpe , eq . ( 4 ) .",
    "essentially he showed that the cfpe approximation is valid provided two conditions are satisfied .",
    "a large number of molecules suffices to ensure that both conditions are satisfied however this is not a necessary condition .",
    "this suggests that there are regimes in which the particle numbers may not be very large and yet the cfpe may still provide a reasonably good approximation of the cme .",
    "however gillespie s derivation does not provide us with a means to estimate the accuracy of the cfpe for general chemical systems .",
    "questions regarding the validity and accuracy of the cfpe and cle are more important now than ever before . in the past decade , interest has virtually exploded in realistic stochastic simulations of biochemical reactions inside cells @xcite .",
    "the exact method of sampling the trajectories of the cme , the stochastic simulation algorithm @xcite , is computationally expensive and the cme is analytically intractable ; thus approximate methods such as the cfpe and the cle have come to the foreground as an alternative means to obtain numerical and theoretical insight into the functioning of intracellular biochemical networks @xcite .",
    "these networks are typically characterized by a large number of bimolecular reactions in which at least one of the species is present in very small molecule numbers @xcite , indeed the precise conditions in which the fidelity of the cfpe remains unclear .",
    "hence the question of the accuracy of the cfpe has nowadays become a practical one  how much can we trust the conclusions derived from the cfpe or the corresponding cle ?    in this article ,",
    "we derive formulas to estimate the relative error in the cfpe predictions of the mean concentrations and of the variance of the fluctuations about the mean .",
    "the results are valid for all monostable chemical reaction networks . as a byproduct of our derivation",
    ", we will also clarify the connection between the cfpe and van kampen s system - size expansion , in particular showing that the non - linear character of the cfpe is not completely spurious and that generally cfpe estimates are more accurate than those obtained from the linear fokker - planck equation .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we use the multivariate system - size expansion to derive expressions for the mean concentrations and for the variance of the fluctuations as predicted by the cme accurate to order @xmath45 . in section iii , we develop the system - size expansion of the cfpe and use it to derive expressions for the mean concentrations and for the variance of the fluctuations accurate to the same order as derived for the cme in section ii . in section iv , we use the results of the previous two sections to derive expressions for the relative error in the predictions of the cfpe .",
    "we also compare the predictions of the cfpe and the linear fokker - planck equation .",
    "these results are tested on two bimolecular reaction systems  dimerization and an enzyme - catalyzed reaction  in section v. we conclude by a discussion in section vi .",
    "we will now probe the mesoscopic description provided by the cme using the system - size expansion developed by van kampen @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to derive expressions for the mean concentrations and for the variance of the fluctuations about these concentrations , as predicted by the cme , accurate to the order of any desired power of the inverse square root of the volume .",
    "the only requirement for the expansion to hold is that the steady - state of the chemical system is asymptotically stable . for the applications that we are interested in , namely biochemical reactions in intracellular conditions",
    ", the number of molecules can be very small , in some cases just few tens of molecules of a given species per cell .",
    "we will derive equations accurate to @xmath45  this accuracy should be more than sufficient for the applications mentioned since terms of lower order , @xmath46 , already imply corrections to the concentrations of the order of a single molecule in the compartment . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that the system - size expansion has been carried to this order for a general system of @xmath4 interacting chemical species .",
    "van kampen has treated a one species example to the same order in his book @xcite while elf and ehrenberg @xcite have derived the multivariate expansion to @xmath47 .",
    "the starting point of the system - size expansion is to write the absolute number of molecules of species @xmath9 as : @xmath48 where @xmath30 is the macroscopic concentration of species @xmath9 as determined by the res .",
    "this has the effect of transforming all functions of @xmath14 in the cme into functions of @xmath49 .",
    "the expansion of the cme proceeds by writing eq .",
    "( 2 ) in terms of the new variables .",
    "details of this transformation can be found in @xcite ; here we will simply state the relevant results and use them for our present derivation .",
    "the variable change causes the probability distribution of molecular populations , @xmath50 , to be transformed into the probability distribution of fluctuations , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the time derivative , the step operator and the microscopic rate function in the cme , read in the new variables : @xmath53 where @xmath54 note that in eq .",
    "( 9 ) the microscopic rate function is expressed in terms of the macroscopic rate function .",
    "as we shall shortly see , this is convenient from a calculation point of view since the final expressions for the means and variances will be solely in terms of functions which appear in the res .",
    "note that the upper limit of the sum in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is 2 because all reactions involve at most the interaction of two molecules and hence @xmath55 equals zero for @xmath56 .",
    "although our analysis is specifically for elementary reactions , one can easily extend the approach to include `` elementary complex '' reactions @xcite .",
    "however we shall not pursue this here .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( 7 - 9 ) in eq .",
    "( 2 ) we get the following new form of the cme : @xmath57 note that terms proportional to @xmath58 do not appear in the expansion of the cme . this is because when one substitutes eqs .",
    "( 7 - 9 ) in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one equates terms of this order on both sides of the cme which simply gives us back the macroscopic res , eq .",
    "( 3 ) .    to proceed",
    "further we need the explicit dependence of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 14 ) on the new variables @xmath49 .",
    "this is obtained by substituting eqs .",
    "( 10 - 13 ) in eq .",
    "( 14 ) which leads to : @xmath59 note that in the above equation , we have used the einstein summation convention where all twice repeated indices are understood to be summed over 1 to @xmath4 .",
    "the partial derivative @xmath60 denotes @xmath61 .",
    "we have also used the following two convenient definitions : @xmath62 from eq .",
    "( 3 ) it follows that @xmath63 and consequently @xmath64 represents the @xmath9-@xmath65 element of the jacobian matrix associated with the res of the system .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 15 ) to order @xmath66 is the linear fokker - planck equation which was mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the drift vector is linear in the @xmath67 variables while the diffusion tensor is independent of them .",
    "both depend on time via their own dependence on the macroscopic concentrations .",
    "this level of approximation is frequently called the linear - noise approximation , a nowadays popular means of estimating the size of the concentration fluctuations about the macroscopic concentrations @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics on mesoscopic length scales and hence we shall consider terms of higher order than @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( 15 ) .",
    "we now proceed to construct equations for the moments of the @xmath67 variables .",
    "we start by expanding @xmath51 as a series in powers of the inverse square root of the volume : @xmath68 from which it follows that the moments possess an equivalent expansion : @xmath69_j \\omega^{-j/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath70_j = \\int \\epsilon_k \\epsilon_m ...",

    "one starts by substituting eq .",

    "( 15 ) , multiplying the resulting equation on both sides by @xmath72 and integrating over @xmath73 . equating terms of order @xmath74 on both sides of the equation",

    "( 19 ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , our aim is to determine the mean concentrations and the variance of the fluctuations about the means and hence we must relate the latter to the moments of the @xmath67 variables above . using eqs .",

    "a detailed protein abundance profiling of the escherichia coli cytosol by ishihama et al @xcite shows that the total number of enzyme molecules per cell approximately varies from a hundred to a few thousands .",
    "it is indeed in this limit of small numbers that it is frequently thought that the cfpe and the cle description are not very accurate .",

    "it is noteworthy that this accuracy is far better than even that hypothesized by proponents of the cfpe @xcite .",
    "for example gillespie in his seminal paper on the derivation of the cle @xcite remarks in his conclusion that the cle ( and hence the cfpe ) approximation is probably not a good one when one models a system composed of three time - varying species with total molecular population of 2000 since it appears quite possible that the molecule number of at least one of the species becomes significantly small at some point in time .",
    "in contrast our theory seems to predict that the cfpe predictions will still be very accurate even when the molecule numbers are quite low .",
    "we have tested these predictions by numerically solving the cle for the michaelis - menten process using the euler - mayurama method to obtain the mean substrate concentrations and the variance of the substrate fluctuations about the means .",

    "the total molecular population of enzyme ( free plus complex form ) is 2500 molecules .",
    "each algorithm ( euler - mayurama and stochastic simulation algorithm ) was run 5 times leading to 5 independent estimates @xcite .",
    "note that even though the mean number of free enzyme molecules is considerably low , the predictions of the cfpe for both the mean and the variance agree ( within sampling error ) with those of the cme . for comparison we have also plotted the predictions of the linear - noise approximation ( red lines ) and of the mean concentration as predicted by the effective mesoscopic rate equation eq .",
    "( 60 ) ( blue line ) .",
    "the results clearly confirm that the cfpe is more accurate than the linear fokker planck equation associated with the linear - noise approximation and that indeed the mean concentrations of the cfpe are in excellent agreement with the effective mesoscopic rate equations derived in ref @xcite .",

    ". 3 one can detect no significant difference between the cfpe and cme predictions .",
    "the numerical experiments were performed with various other parameter sets  in all cases we could not detect any discrepancy between the cfpe and cme predictions within sampling error .",
    "summarizing , in this article we have shown that ( i ) the mean and variance predictions of the cfpe are accurate to order @xmath0 . since those of the linear fokker - planck equation are accurate to order @xmath3 for the mean and @xmath0 for the variance , it is clear that the cfpe is generally more accurate than the linear fokker - planck equation or equivalently the linear - noise approximation .",
    "( ii ) for detailed balance conditions , the predictions of the cfpe are even more accurate , order @xmath1 , i.e. in equilibrium or near equilibrium conditions the cfpe does an excellent job of approximating the cme . (",
    "iii ) accuracy to such high order in inverse powers of the system volume implies that the cfpe estimates should be quite good even for small populations of molecules .",
    "our simulations for dimerization and enzyme - catalyzed reactions support these theoretical conclusions , with impressively good agreement down to an average of 5 molecules for the dimerization example .",
    "the cfpe s accuracy is indeed surprising given that it arises out of a naive truncation of the kramers - moyal expansion of the cme and that the cfpe can not be obtained from the systematic system - size expansion of the cme .",
    "only the linear fokker - planck equation can be derived from the latter expansion by considering terms of order @xmath66 .",
    "this equation leads to mean and variance estimates which are accurate to orders @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "now if one wants more accurate estimates one needs to consider higher - order terms in the expansion . to get mean",
    "concentration estimates to order @xmath39 one needs to consider the term in the system - size expansion proportional to @xmath3 @xcite . to this order",
    ", one does not obtain the cfpe , rather one obtains a partial differential equation with a third - order derivative .",
    "however , it turns out that the mean calculated from this equation precisely agrees with that calculated from the cfpe to order @xmath39 .",
    "if we even wanted to get more accurate means and variance , say both to order @xmath1 , we need to consider terms in the system - size expansion to order @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to a partial differential equation for the time evolution of the probability density function with derivatives as high as fifth order .",
    "once again this is not the cfpe .",
    "however under steady - state conditions obeying detailed balance , the estimates from this high - order differential equation and the cfpe exactly agree to order @xmath1 .",
    "hence we have shown that though it is true that the cfpe does not arise out of the system - size expansion , nevertheless its predictions are better than those which can be obtained by considering only the first term of the expansion ( the linear - noise approximation ) as is conventional @xcite .",
    "it follows that the non - linear character of the cfpe is not completely spurious as originally suggested by van kampen @xcite .",
    "our study is the first one to our knowledge which systematically analyzes the validity of the non - linear multivariate cfpe and which derives approximate expressions for the size of the errors in the cfpe estimates  previous studies @xcite have focused on the cfpe for unimolecular reactions and for unimolecular and bimolecular reactions involving one species @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the system - size expansion and thus has the same limitations , namely that it is only applicable for chemical systems which are `` asymptotically stable in the sense of lyapunov '' .",
    "this implies that from our analysis we can not draw any conclusions for bistable systems @xcite . within these constraints ,",
    "the system - size expansion is a legitimate means of obtaining the moments of the cme accurate to any desired order @xcite .",
    "a few authors @xcite have expressed reservations regarding the accuracy of the expansion beyond the linear - noise level , their reasoning stemming from the fact that pawula s theorem @xcite states that a time - evolution equation for a probability density function with higher than second - order derivatives can not describe a stochastic process .",
    "however these misgivings are undue  the higher - order partial differential equation stemming from the expansion truncated to some order is `` not an exact equation for a markov process that in some way approximates the original process ; rather it is an approximate equation for the exact p. '' @xcite .",
    "this statement of van kampen is generally true for any legitimate expansion of the cme , not only the system - size expansion ; for example risken and vollmer @xcite showed that taking into account higher - order derivatives than two in the kramers - moyal expansion of the cme also leads to more accurate solutions than if one just had to use the cfpe .",
    "the accuracy of the system - size expansion beyond the linear - noise approximation has also been verified by many recent studies @xcite , putting at rest any small doubts about its general validity .",
    "finally , the good agreement of our theoretical expressions for the errors with simulations is a clear indication of the soundness of our system - size expansion based approach .    concluding our results offer theoretical and numerical support for gillespie s hypothesis @xcite regarding the validity of the cfpe in both mesoscopic and macroscopic systems .",

    "<S> the chemical fokker - planck equation and the corresponding chemical langevin equation are commonly used approximations of the chemical master equation . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are derived from an uncontrolled , second - order truncation of the kramers - moyal expansion of the chemical master equation and hence their accuracy remains to be clarified . </S>",
    "<S> we use the system - size expansion to show that chemical fokker - planck estimates of the mean concentrations and of the variance of the concentration fluctuations about the mean are accurate to order @xmath0 for reaction systems which do not obey detailed balance and at least accurate to order @xmath1 for systems obeying detailed balance , where @xmath2 is the characteristic size of the system . </S>",
    "<S> hence the chemical fokker - planck equation turns out to be more accurate than the linear - noise approximation of the chemical master equation ( the linear fokker - planck equation ) which leads to mean concentration estimates accurate to order @xmath3 and variance estimates accurate to order @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this higher accuracy is particularly conspicuous for chemical systems realized in small volumes such as biochemical reactions inside cells . </S>",
    "<S> a formula is also obtained for the approximate size of the relative errors in the concentration and variance predictions of the chemical fokker - planck equation , where the relative error is defined as the difference between the predictions of the chemical fokker - planck equation and the master equation divided by the prediction of the master equation . for dimerization and enzyme - catalyzed reactions , </S>",
    "<S> the errors are typically less than few percent even when the steady - state is characterized by merely few tens of molecules . </S>"
