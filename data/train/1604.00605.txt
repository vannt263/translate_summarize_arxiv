    "the exotic states are the states which could not be explained by conventional mesonic ( @xmath6 ) and baryonic ( @xmath7 ) scheme . nowadays , the experimental facilities across the world , generating the huge amount of data ( states ) which need extra theoretical attention @xcite . all these states carried the information of the fundamental behaviour of the qcd . as per the underlying theory , only the color neutral states are possible , just like mesons and baryons .",
    "the theory predicted more complicated color neutral states like tetraquark , pentaquark , hexaquark , hybrid , glueball and molecule like structures @xcite .",
    "the explanation of structures and dynamics of such states are still open questions .",
    "+ recently , some experimental groups like , bes iii - collaboration @xcite , gams - group at cern and bnle852-collaboration @xcite had observed few states ( below 2.5 gev ) , may have exotic structure and quantum numbers , required theoretical attentions .",
    "in such aspect , the spectroscopy of mesons are playing a dominant role in the study of the qcd , especially , the light meson sector which carries the information of nonperturbative regime .",
    "the scalar mesons in the light mass regime may give the clue for the symmetry breaking , as they have the same quantum numbers as of vacuum .",
    "the difficulties with the study of light mesons sector are their large decay widths as well as their appearance does not come with narrow isolated peaks .",
    "+    .experimentally observed states ( in mev ) @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the digamma decay width have been calculated on hadron loops employing an expansion in the range for force while the leading term assumes to a point like vertex .",
    "the formula with leading order correction @xcite is being @xmath8^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath9    @xmath10 is given by eq.(12 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicate fine - structure constant and the factor @xmath13 = @xmath14 , the @xmath15 gev , m is the mass of constituent meson , @xmath16 is the mass of molecular meson and @xmath17 is binding energy .",
    "the digamma decay widths are tabulated in table-5 .",
    "we have employed the semirelativistic approach to calculate the masses and digamma decay width of the proposed dimesonic molecular states . here , we have considered the three combination pp - states , pv - states and vv - states .",
    "our results are tabulated in table-4 @xmath185 .",
    "the yukawa - like potential with sigma exchange and one pion exchange potential are used as an interaction potential for dimesonic systems .",
    "we have found that the contribution from yukawa - like potential being approximately 80@xmath1985@xmath20 ( attractive ) , sigma exchange 12@xmath1915@xmath20 ( repulsive ) and one pion exchange uo to @xmath21 ( attractive or repulsive depending upon spin - isospin channel ) to the net potential strength .",
    "+ we have applied our model to @xmath22 which is widely believed to be a @xmath23 molecule in literatures @xcite .",
    "the color screening parameter c is the only the parameter which has fitted once , to get the approximate mass of the state @xmath22 .",
    "the calculated mass is found @xmath24 mev with approximately 9.8 mev binding energy and both are close to experimental measurements @xcite . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the binding energy was found nearly @xmath25 mev which is almost twice then in the present study ( see table-3 ref.@xcite ) , same with other dimesonic states . the digamma width and mass is being found close in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "thus , we have used this model to study other dimesonic combinations .",
    "the various dimesonic states are very close to the experimentally observed states in accordance to their masses .",
    "+ the molecular state should have small binding and large radius compared to the size of their constituents .",
    "we have found radius of all combinations near @xmath26 fm to @xmath27 fm with small binding energy , see table-4 ( negative sign shows the bound state ) .",
    "the various states like @xmath28 in pv - state , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 in vv - states are compared with dimesonic states .",
    "the masses of the states @xmath22 , @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath35 are in excellent agreement with the pdg listing @xcite",
    ". moreover , some states like @xmath29 and @xmath33 compared with @xmath37 and @xmath38 having 20 to 50 mev deference in mass compared to experimental measurement @xcite . the quantum numbers for the dimesonic system are assigned as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the digamma decay width for the states @xmath22 and @xmath39 are in agreement with experimental values , while for the state @xmath33 has been overestimated , see table-5 .",
    "on the basis of mass spectra and quantum numbers , we are able to identify states having promising non @xmath40 structures .",
    "the calculated masses and digamma widths of the compared states are close to the experimental measurements @xcite except few states like @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath33 ( see table-3 @xmath184 ) .",
    "moreover , the states @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 have been found in the literature with the possibilities of other structures like glueball or tetraquark @xcite . whereas , in the ref.@xcite the state @xmath30 and @xmath32 have been predicted as a promising vv molecule .",
    "our calculated mass spectra of the state @xmath30 and @xmath32 are in agreement with @xcite and suggest it as vv - molecule .",
    "even more , some states like @xmath34 and @xmath35 have not confirmed place in the pdg list @xcite . + in the framework of the present study , we have only incorporated the pion and sigma exchange as su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "the tensor and spin - orbit coupling may have significant contribution which are very useful for l@xmath410 as well as for mixed states . to confirm the molecular structures of all these states",
    ", one has to study other properties like decay width , possible coupling , etc .",
    "our aim of the present study is to give the attention to all these states which may have a possible molecular internal structure and the predicted mass spectra will provide reference for future study of molecular dimesonic states .",
    "we will take this study one step further ahead by including other mesons contributions with possible s - d wave mixing , as our future study .",
    "+ finally , in this paper , we are able to calculate the s - wave masses and digamma decay widths of the dimesonic states in the light meson sector .",
