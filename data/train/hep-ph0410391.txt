    "despite the success of the standard model ( sm ) in the gauge and fermion sectors , the higgs sector remains the least tested aspect of the model , and the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is still a puzzle .",
    "however , the analysis of raditive corrections within the sm @xcite , points towards the existence of a higgs boson with mass of the order of the ew scale , which could be detected in the early stages of lhc @xcite . on the other hand , the sm is often considered as an effective theory , valid up to an energy scale of @xmath14 , and",
    "eventually it will be replaced by a more fundamental theory , which will explain , among other things , the physics behind ewsb and perhaps even the origin of flavor .",
    "several examples of candidate theories , which range from supersymmetry @xcite to deconstruction @xcite , include a higgs sector with two scalar doublets , which has a rich structure and predicts interesting phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the general two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) has a potential problem with flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by the higgs bosons , which arises when each quark type ( u and d ) is allowed to couple to both higgs doublets , and fcnc could be induced at large rates that may jeopardize the model .",
    "the possible solutions to this problem of the thdm involve an assumption about the yukawa structure of the model . to discuss them it is convenient to refer to the yukawa lagrangian , which is written for the quarks fields as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote the higgs doublets .",
    "the specific choices for the yukawa matrices @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) define the versions of the thdm known as i , ii or iii , which involve the following mechanisms , that are aimed either to eliminate the otherwise unbearable fcnc problem or at least to keep it under control , namely :    1 .",
    "_ discrete symmetries . _",
    "a discrete symmetry can be invoked to allow a given fermion type ( u or d - quarks for instance ) to couple to a single higgs doublet , and in such case fcnc are absent at tree - level . in particular , when a single higgs field gives masses to both types of quarks ( either @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , the resulting model is referred as thdm - i . on the other hand , when each type of quark couples to a different higgs doublet ( either @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) , the model is known as the thdm - ii . this thdm - ii pattern is highly motivated because it arises at tree - level in the minimal susy extension for the sm ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "radiative supression .",
    "_ when each fermion type couples to both higgs doublets , fcnc could be kept under control if there exists a hierarchy between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "namely , a given set of yukawa matrices is present at tree - level , but the other ones arise only as a radiative effect .",
    "this occurs for instance in the mssm , where the type - ii thdm structure is not protected by any symmetry , and is transformed into a type - iii thdm ( see bellow ) , through the loop effects of sfermions and gauginos .",
    "namely , the yukawa couplings that are already present at tree - level in the mssm ( @xmath25 ) receive radiative corrections , while the terms ( @xmath26 ) are induced at one - loop level .",
    "+ in particular , when the `` seesaw '' mechanism  @xcite is implemented in the mssm to explain the observed neutrino masses  @xcite , lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) appears naturally in the right - handed neutrino sector , which is then communicated to the sleptons and from there to the charged leptons and higgs sector .",
    "these corrections allow the neutral higgs bosons to mediate lfv , in particular it was found that the ( higgs - mediated ) tau decay @xmath27 @xcite as well as the ( real ) higgs boson decay @xmath28 @xcite , can enter into possible detection domain .",
    "similar effects are known to arise in the quark sector , for instance @xmath29 can reach branching fractions at large @xmath30 , that can be probed at run  ii of the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "3 .   _ flavor symmetries . _ suppression for fcnc can also be achived when a certain form of the yukawa matrices that reproduce the observed fermion masses and mixing angles is implemented in the model , which is then named as thdm - iii .",
    "this could be done either by implementing the frogart - nielsen mechanism to generate the fermion mass hierarchies @xcite , or by studying a certain ansatz for the fermion mass matrices @xcite .",
    "the first proposal for the higgs boson couplings along these lines was posed in @xcite , it was based on the six - texture form of the mass matrices , namely : @xmath31 then , by assuming that each yukawa matrix @xmath17 has the same hierarchy , one finds : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "then , the fermion - fermion@xmath35-higgs boson ( @xmath36 ) couplings obey the following pattern : @xmath37 , which is known as the cheng - sher ansatz .",
    "this brings under control the fcnc problem , and it has been extensively studied in the literature to search for flavor - violating signals in the higgs sector @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in studying the thdm - iii . however , the six - texture ansatz seems disfavored by current data on the ckm mixing angles .",
    "more recently , mass matrices with four - texture ansatz have been considered , and are found in better agreement with the observed data @xcite .",
    "it is interesting then to investigate how the cheng - sher form of the @xmath36 couplings , get modified when one replaces the six - texture matrices by the four - texture ansatz .",
    "this paper is aimed precisely to study this question ; we want to derive the form of the @xmath38 couplings and to discuss how and when the resulting predictions could be tested , both in rare quark and lepton decays and in the phenomenology of the higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "unlike previous studies , we keep in our analysis the effect of the complex phases , which modify the fcnc higgs boson couplings .    the organization of the paper goes as follows : in section 2",
    ", we discuss the lagrangian for the thdm with the four - texture form for the mass matrices , and present the results for the @xmath38 vertices in the quark sector .",
    "then , in section 3 we study the constraints impossed on the parameters of the model from low energy flavor violating processes .",
    "section 4 includes the predictions of the model for both , flavor conserving ( fc ) and flavor violating ( fv ) higgs boson decays . while in section 5",
    ", we discuss the capabilities of future @xmath39 and hadron colliders to detect such decays .",
    "finally , section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian of the thdm - iii is written for the quarks fields as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath16 denote the higgs doublets .",
    "the specific choices for the yukawa matrices @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) define the versions of the thdm known as i , ii or iii .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking the quark mass matrix is given by , @xmath41    we will asuume that both yukawa matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43 have the four - texture form and hermitic ; following the conventions of @xcite , the quark mass matrix is then written as :    @xmath44    when @xmath45 one recovers the six - texture form .",
    "we also consider the hierarchy : + @xmath46 , which is supported by the observed fermion masses in the sm .    because of the hermicity condition , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are real parameters , while the phases of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , can be removed from the mass matrix @xmath52 by defining : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 $ ] , and the mass matrix @xmath55 includes only the real parts of @xmath52 .",

    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the reaction @xmath285 produces a large sample of events which could be detectable provided a @xmath286-factor is above a certain value , which depends on the higgs boson mass and the coupling @xmath12 ( which enter in the event rate both from the higgs boson production and decay ) , this factor is defined as @xmath287 to have a detectable signal at lhc for @xmath288 , the modulus of this factor has to be above @xmath289 , as obtained from a detailed analysis of signal and backgrounds performed in ref.@xcite , to which we refer for details of kinematical cuts , acceptances and parton distributions .    in figs .",

    "* we will concentrate here on the lfv higgs boson decays @xmath292 , which has a very small branching ratio within the context of the sm with light neutrinos ( @xmath293 ) , so that this channel becomes an excellent window for probing new physics@xcite .",
    "the decay width for the procces @xmath292 ( adding both final states @xmath266 and @xmath265 ) can be written in terms of the decay width @xmath294 , as follows : ( _ i ) = ( r^_)^2 ( h_i ) where r^_= _ 23 therefore , the higgs boson branching ratio can be approximated as : @xmath295 . we calculated the branching fraction for @xmath296 , and find that it reaches values of order @xmath297 in the thdm - iii ; for comparison , we notice that in the mssm case , even for large values of @xmath30 , one only gets @xmath298 .",
    "these values of the branching ratio enter into the domain of detectability at hadron colliders ( lhc ) , provided that the cross - section for higgs boson production were of order of the sm one .",

    "@xcite it was proposed a series of cuts to reconstruct the hadronic and electronic tau decays from @xmath308 and separate the signal from the backgrounds , which are dominated by drell - yan tau pair and ww pair production . according to these studies @xcite , even sm - like cross sections and @xmath309 , one coud detect at lhc the lfv higgs boson decays with a branching ratio of order @xmath310 , which means that our signal is clearly detectable .",
    "we have studied in this paper the @xmath36 couplings that arise in the thdm - iii , using a hermitic four - texture form for the fermionic yukawa matrix .",
    "because of this , although the @xmath36 couplings are complex , the cp - properties of @xmath311 ( even ) and @xmath222 ( odd ) remmain valid .    we have derived bounds on the parameters of the model , using current experimental bounds on lfv and fcnc transitions .",
    "one can say that the present bounds on the couplings @xmath312 s still allow the possibility to study interesting direct flavor violating higgs boson signals at future colliders , provided one takes not too large values of @xmath30 ( @xmath313 ) .",
