    "the half - space theorem by hoffman and meeks @xcite states that if a properly immersed minimal surface @xmath3 in @xmath4 lies on one side of some plane @xmath5 , then @xmath3 is a plane parallel to @xmath5 . as a consequence",
    ", they proved the strong half - space theorem which says that two properly immersed minimal surfaces in @xmath4 that do not intersect must be parallel planes .",
    "these theorems have been generalized to some other ambient simply connected homogeneous manifolds with dimension 3 .",
    "for example , we have half - space theorems with respect to horospheres in @xmath6 @xcite , vertical minimal planes in @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite,@xcite and entire minimal graph in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is known that there is no half - space theorem for horizontal slices in @xmath0 , since rotational minimal surfaces ( catenoids ) are contained in a slab @xcite-@xcite , but one has half - space theorems for constant mean curvature @xmath9 surfaces in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the first author proved a general half - space theorem for constant mean curvature surfaces . under certain hypothesis",
    ", he proved that in a riemannian @xmath10-manifold of bounded geometry , a constant mean curvature @xmath2 surface on one side of a parabolic constant mean curvature @xmath2 surface @xmath11 is an equidistant surface to @xmath11 .    in euclidian spaces of dimension",
    "higher than @xmath12 , there is no strong half - space theorem , since there exist rotational proper minimal hypersurfaces contained in a slab .    in @xcite , menezes proves a half - space theorem for some complete vertical minimal graphs , more precisely , she looks at some particular graphs @xmath13 over a domain @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a hadamard surface with bounded curvature , these graphs are called ideal scherk graphs and their existence was proved by collin and rosenberg in @xcite for @xmath1 and by galvez and rosenberg in @xcite in the general case .    [ ana ] let @xmath15 denote a hadamard surface with bounded curvature and let @xmath16 be an ideal scherk graph over an admissible polygonal domain @xmath17 . if @xmath3 is a properly immersed minimal surface contained in @xmath18 and disjoint from @xmath11 , then @xmath3 is a translate of @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the case where the graph has constant mean curvature . more precisely , we consider graphs over @xmath1 with constant mean curvature @xmath19 . in that case , we prove a result similar to the one of menezes .",
    "we notice that the value @xmath20 is critical in this setting ( see @xcite for the @xmath20 case ) .",
    "the graphs that we will work with are graphs of functions @xmath21 defined in a domain @xmath22 whose boundary @xmath23 is composed of complete arcs @xmath24 and @xmath25 , such that the curvatures of the arcs with respect to the domain are @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these graphs will have constant mean curvature and @xmath21 will assume the value @xmath28 on each @xmath29 and @xmath30 on each @xmath31 .",
    "these domains @xmath32 will be called _ scherk type domains _ and the functions @xmath21 _ scherk type solutions_. the existence of these graphs is assured by a. folha and s. melo in @xcite . there , the authors give necessary and sufficient conditions on the geometry of the domain @xmath32 to prove the existence of such a solution . in this context , we prove the following result .",

    "if @xmath3 is a properly immersed cmc @xmath2 surface contained in @xmath18 and above @xmath11 , then @xmath3 is a vertical translate of @xmath11 .",
    "the original idea of hoffman and meeks is to use the @xmath34-parameter family of catenoids as _ a priori _ barriers to control minimal surfaces on one side of a plane ( here _ a priori _ means that the choice of catenoids is independent of the particular minimal surface you want to control ) . in more general situations ,",
    "it is not easy to construct such a continuous family of barriers so some authors use a discrete family ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "menezes works also with such a discrete family . in our case",
    ", it does not seem possible to construct such a family in an easy way .",
    "our approach is based on the existence of only one barrier whose construction depends on the particular surface @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will give a brief presentation of the scherk type graphs and the result of folha and melo .",
    "section 3 contains the proof of theorem  [ main ] , so one of the main step is the existence of the barriers which uses the perron method .",
    "we also prove a uniqueness result for the constant mean curvature equation .",
    "in this section we present the theorem by a. folha and s. melo in @xcite that assure the existence of constant mean curvature graphs which take the boundary value @xmath28 on certain arcs @xmath29 and @xmath30 on arcs @xmath31 . all along this section",

    "the arcs are called the edges of @xmath32 and the cluster points are the vertices of @xmath32 .",
    "we notice that a complete curve in @xmath1 with constant curvature @xmath41 is proper .",
    "if @xmath43 is a domain whose boundary is a @xmath41-polygon , we will denote by @xmath29 ( resp . @xmath44 the arcs of the boundary whose curvature is @xmath41 ( resp .",

    "we say that a domain @xmath32 in @xmath1 is a _ scherk type domain _ if its boundary is a @xmath41-polygon and if each vertex is the end point of one arc @xmath29 and one arc @xmath31 .",
    "such a domain @xmath32 is drawn in figure  [ fig ] .",

    "we say that @xmath5 is an _ admissible inscribed polygon _ if @xmath46 is a domain whose boundary is a @xmath41-polygon and its vertices are among the ones of @xmath43 .",

    "denote by @xmath52 the compact arc of @xmath29 which is the part of @xmath29 outside these two horodisks .",

    "we define @xmath57    where @xmath58 .",
    "we remark that a scherk type domain has finite area .",
    "so we can introduce @xmath59 the area of @xmath32 and @xmath60 the area of @xmath5 .    with these definitions we can state the main theorem of @xcite .",
    "[ abgail ] let @xmath32 be a scherk type domain .",
    "then there exists a solution @xmath21 for the dirichlet problem in @xmath32 if and only if for some choice of the horodisks ( in @xmath50 ) at the vertices , @xmath61 and for any admissible inscribed polygons @xmath62 ,    @xmath63    it could seem that the conditions depend on the choice of the horodisks in @xmath50 , actually they are independent of that choice if the horodisks are small enough .",
    "the details and the proof of this theorem can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will prove the following result    let @xmath22 be a scherk type domain and @xmath21 be a scherk type solution over @xmath32 ( for some value @xmath19 ) . denote by @xmath33 . if @xmath3 is a properly immersed cmc @xmath2 surface contained in @xmath18 and above @xmath11 , then @xmath3 is a vertical translate of @xmath11 .",

    "then , @xmath85 is invertible .",
    "we conclude that @xmath83 is invertible .",
    "it follows by the implicit function theorem that for all @xmath97 close to @xmath21 there exists a solution of @xmath98 in @xmath99 with @xmath100 in @xmath101 . in other words",

    "from now on , we will assume that @xmath108 ( the case where @xmath109 for a point @xmath110 will be considered in the proof of the theorem ) .",
    "then for @xmath111 sufficiently small , we have that @xmath112    now , let @xmath113 be as in lemma [ lemma1 ] , fix @xmath114 where @xmath115 satisfies and @xmath73 given by lemma  [ lemma1 ] associated to @xmath115 .",
    "we will construct a second barrier to control the surface @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , we will prove the existence of a function @xmath116 that satisfies        to prove this proposition we will use the perron method . let us recall the framework of this method .",
    "a function @xmath120 is called a _ subsolution _ for @xmath121 if for any compact subdomain @xmath122 and any solution @xmath123 of with @xmath124 on the boundary of @xmath125 , we have @xmath124 on u.      let @xmath129 be a geodesic disk of small radius such that @xmath130 .",
    "theorem 3.2 in @xcite implies that the dirichlet problem for equation can be solved in @xmath131 .",

    "moreover , @xmath169 is a point of contact of @xmath167 and @xmath165 , and by the maximum principle , @xmath170 .",
    "it follows that @xmath171 in @xmath131 , since @xmath160 on @xmath137 then @xmath172 , and this contradicts @xmath173 .",
