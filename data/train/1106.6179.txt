    "the original landau - zener ( lz ) problem involves a two - level system whose energy separation varies as a linear function of time .",
    "these two states can be associated to the lowest states of a single - particle in a double - well potential . as it is well known @xcite ,",
    "the transition probability between the two energy states is the well known lz formula @xmath0 written in terms of the tunnelling - coupling parameter @xmath1 and the time - dependent detunning @xmath2 , accounting for the probability that a particle initially in the bottom well at @xmath3 reaches at @xmath4 the opposite well .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the many body generalization of the lz phenomena by loading an ultracold bose gas into a pair of coupled one - dimensional chains where a controllable inter - chain sweep leads to the observation of both , avoided crossings and breakdown of adiabatic inter - chain transfer @xcite .    before the experimental realization of the many body lz generalization ,",
    "several theoretical descriptions of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) confined in a double - well potential have addressed the lz problem within two intrinsically different approaches .",
    "we make reference to the two - mode mean - field and bose - hubbard schemes inherited from the gross - pitaevskii and full quantum approaches @xcite . as a result of incorporating the linear variation in time between the two levels ,",
    "all of those treatments suggested a breakdown of the adiabatic limit , that is , that the lz transition probability does not vanish even in the adiabatic limit .",
    "for example , the non - linear two - level system shows that the mean - field interactions among particles tend to increase the tunnelling probability and that there exists a critical value of the interaction strength beyond which the transition probability becomes nonzero even in the adiabatic limit @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a stationary phase approximation leads to a characteristic scaling or power law for the critical behavior that occurs as the nonlinear parameter equals the gap of avoided crossing energy levels @xcite . regarding the asymmetric lz tunnelling in a periodic potential , jona - lasinio et .",
    "@xcite found that the tunnelling rates for the two directions of tunnelling are not the same .",
    "tunnelling from the ground state to the excited state is enhanced by the nonlinearity , where as in the opposite direction it is suppressed .",
    "even more , a lz formula has been derived for the two mode many - particle scenario @xcite .    here , we are devoted to the description of the many body lz generalization described in the first paragraph .",
    "that is , we are interested in describing a bec confined in two - coupled 1d chains where the potential depths , defining the lattice sites , are linearly modified in time such that a sweep from an initial energy difference @xmath5 to a final one @xmath6 is achieved . to analyze such a system",
    ", we shall use a model hamiltonian that incorporates both , the full quantum frame of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite and a decoupling approximation scheme @xcite that involves certain superfluid order parameters .",
    "these are @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 create and annihilate particles in lattice sites @xmath11 and side chain @xmath12 .",
    "the average is the expectation value in the investigated states .",
    "a previous theoretical work has employed the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method @xcite where , with a small number of links in the chains , qualitative agreement with the experiment was found .",
    "our model simulates two coupled infinite chains with a local site hamiltonian written in terms of the on - site non - perturbative inter - particle interaction strength @xmath13 , the time - dependent detunning @xmath6 and the intra- and inter - chain coupling energies @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the model satisfactorily describes qualitatively the main features of the experiment : the transfer efficiency across ground - state sweeps , that in turn exhibits a breakdown of adiabaticity as the sweep rate decreases , and the transfer efficiency across inverse sweeps , that actually show consistent results with the single - particle landau - zener scenario .",
    "regarding the single - particle lz result the model hamiltonian allows us to recover the result for a single dimer .",
    "in addition , since the number of particles per lattice sites in the actual experiments is not too large , it is possible to perform accurate numerical simulations of the system .",
    "such a analysis gives rise to a richer spectrum with respect to the single dimer considered in @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized in vi sections . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model hamiltonian that provides a suitable description to the experiment .",
    "we also justify the use of the decoupling approximation and the one band scheme within the full quantum and mean - field approximation schemes . in section",
    "iii we characterize the stationary states as a function of the both , the inter - particle interaction strength @xmath13 and the the parameter characterizing the tilt @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we concentrate in determining the energy spectrum for the model hamiltonian and the behaviour of the superfluid order parameters @xmath16 .",
    "an exhaustive exploration of the parameter space allows us to encode the dynamical behavior of the of ground - state and inverse sweeps in a phase diagram .",
    "the latter are presented in sections iv and v respectively . finally , in section",
    "vi a summary of the main results is given .",
    "the physical system that we want to describe is a finite collection of interacting bose atoms initially placed in one of the sides of a composed pairwise coupled lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and its subsequent evolution when the pairwise potential depths are linearly modified in time .",
    "as schematically shown , the transport of particles in @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions occurs as a consequence of the intrinsic tunnelling among the pairwise coupled sites , but it is also affected by the external variation of the well potential depths with time in the form of a sweep from an initial energy difference @xmath19 to a final one @xmath20 .",
    "the parameters responsible for such a transport are the on - site inter - particle interaction strength @xmath13 , the intra - chain coupling energy @xmath14 ( @xmath18 direction ) , the inter - chain coupling energy @xmath15 ( @xmath17 direction ) and the time - dependent parameter characterizing the tilt between the two wells of each site in the chain , namely , the detunning parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to fully characterize stationary and dynamical properties of the system described above . to proceed",
    ", we will consider the experimental realization reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where the transfer of particles in @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions is studied in what it is called the ground - state and inverse sweeps , the former accounting for a sweep starting from the ground state , namely , where all the particles initiate in the bottom well with lower energy , and the latter where the initially filled sites are the ones with higher energy .",
    "this scheme leads us to answer several questions , on one side those related to the stationary properties , such as , the energy spectrum , and on the other side , aspects related to the dynamical behavior of the atomic population in the wells .",
    "of special interest in this regard is the determination of the phase diagram encoding the dependence of the transfer efficiency on the parameters characterizing the dynamics .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the model hamiltonian of the system .",
    "since the particles are not allowed to tunnel between left and right wells of _ different _ sites @xmath11 , movements in @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions must be considered separately .",
    "therefore , we consider the dynamics along the sites and their counterpart between the left and right chains .    regarding the two - well geometry and its intrinsic asymmetry supplied by the time - dependent parameter @xmath6",
    ", we should first argue about the level picture scheme where our system is appropriately described . due to the variation of such a parameter not just the first band but excited levels",
    "might play a significant role . as established by dounas - frazer et .",
    "@xcite the transport phenomena of a bose - einstein condensate in an asymmetric double well leads to three new energy scales with respect to the symmetric trap and one - band assumptions .",
    "these are the hopping , tilt and the energy gap between the first and second bands .",
    "the task of including at least a two - band picture ( that is , four levels per site ) leads to a hilbert space of size @xmath21 with @xmath22 the number of atoms per site .",
    "however , since the lz phenomena involves the presence of just two states , we should restrict ourselves to the first band of the time - varying tilted double - well potential .",
    "this can be done by appropriately taking the formal bounds where a one - band picture is well justified , which primarily assumes that the interaction energy is much smaller that the energy band difference . in the appendix we present a study of the single - particle energy levels in a double - well potential as a function of the tilt @xmath6 . to fulfill the condition that the inter - particle energy interaction is much smaller than the energy gap between the first and second bands we shall confine ourselves to values of @xmath6 for which the bands are well separated and thus the condition with the inter - particle interaction will be considered accordingly .",
    "starting from the bose - hubbard hamiltonian of an optical lattice @xcite , one can write down the hamiltonian of atoms in the two - well chain as , @xmath23 where the labels @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote movements in @xmath18 and @xmath17 directions respectively .",
    "@xmath26 represents the tunnelling along the chains , while @xmath27 takes into account the local two - level structure at sites @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to the on - site interaction energy .    to consider the participation of the lattice sites , that is the transport in the @xmath18 direction , we use the decoupling approximation where order parameters @xmath7 , @xmath10 are introduced to account for the expectation value of the tunnelling of particles between left and right wells , disregarding the position of the site @xmath11 within the chain .",
    "we consider negligible the average fluctuations of creation and annihilation particle operators in sites @xmath11 and @xmath29 , such that , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this allows us to write @xcite ,    @xmath32    thus , by substituting this expression into @xmath26 we arrive to the model hamiltonian at each lattice site given by ,    @xmath33    this model hamiltonian represents the local site energy of an infinite chain , where the interaction is non - perturbative .",
    "we should emphasize that the fact of considering a mean - field approach to separate the effective contributions by site leads us to the task of self - consistently determining the order parameters @xmath34 , @xmath10 to specify the hamiltonian ( [ hmodel ] ) .    regarding the hilbert space size",
    ", one can see that the fock space of the coupled chains can be described in terms of the occupation number of sites @xmath11 and @xmath35 . in fig .",
    "[ sites ] we illustrate the equivalence among both , sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 and sides @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the fock space elements can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , being @xmath22 the total number of particles at each site @xmath11 .",
    "thus , our model hamiltonian , representing the local site energy of an infinite chain , corresponds effectively to @xmath22 particles with three  internal \" states .",
    "consequently the fock space at each lattice site scales with the number of particles as @xmath44 .",
    "it is important to notice that while the transport along @xmath18 direction is accounted for in a mean - field fashion , the tunnelling among left and right sides ( @xmath17 direction ) is fully quantum described .",
    "the assumption of the mean - field approach in this case is well justified in the sense that in the experimental situation near the centre of the trap , the average the number of particles per site on left and right sides , is the same along the chains . as we shall see in the next sections ,",
    "this treatment allows us to study up to @xmath45 particles per site .",
    "in this section we study the stationary states of hamiltonian ( [ hmodel ] ) for a given number of particles , as a function of the interaction strength @xmath13 and the parameter characterizing the tilt @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we solve the time - independent schrdinger equation for the model hamiltonian to determine the energy spectrum as a function of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to point out that in our calculations both , the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath6 are referred to the tunnelling coupling parameter @xmath46 . here and",
    "henceforth we use @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    to determine the entire energy spectrum of hamiltonian ( [ hmodel ] ) we have to find the value of the order parameters @xmath34 @xmath49 .",

    "we obtain by means of a variational procedure the values of @xmath34 @xmath49 @xcite that minimize the ground state energy @xmath52 . in other words , we search for the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath53 by minimizing with respect to @xmath34 @xmath49 . once those optimal values have been determined , we calculate the entire spectrum by means of standard diagonalization methods . then , for the same value of @xmath50 we repeat the same process for each value of @xmath51    in fig .",

    ", the region delimited for those values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 indicates that there is no tunnelling and consequently a mott insulator phase can be nucleated since the average fluctuations in the population per site are negligible .",
    "conversely , a superfluid phase is associated when the order parameters are different from zero , the superfluid component in the system being maximal in the diffuse area for @xmath57 . as expected ,",
    "the indistinguishable character of left and right wells is confirmed from the symmetry exhibited in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "in other words , if the on - site interaction energy @xmath50 between the particles dominates the tunnelling coupling @xmath1 ( @xmath67 ) , the lz transitions split into @xmath22 avoided level crossings [ see fig.[fig3 ] ( c ) ] , each corresponding to the transfer of one particle .",

    "as the system evolves in time depending on the interaction , the system can transit different phases ( superfluid or insulating ) multiple times , see fig .",
    "we identified a a critical value of the interaction @xmath141 , for which @xmath142 , the system is in a crossover from insulating states ( @xmath143 ) with @xmath144 to a superfluid states ( @xmath121 ) with @xmath145 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that all of our results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental realization .",
    "in addition , our analysis provides insight to the region where the interaction is non - perturvative .",
    "this work was partially supported by grants papit in108812 - 2 and in116110 dgapa ( unam ) .",
    "computational facilities by dgsca - unam are also acknowledged .",
    "we would like to thank v. gal for useful discussions regarding the implementation of computation algorithms .",
    "in ( [ twell ] ) . in these plots @xmath146 and 0.08 . ]    to establish appropriate bounds for the values of the parameters that determine the dynamics of the bose gas in the coupled one - dimensional chains , that is , their practical use in relation to the proposed model hamiltonian ( [ hmodel ] ) , we analyze here the eigensystem of a single particle confined in an asymmetric double well . although a previous study has provided quantitative criteria regarding the energy level scheme where a many - particle system can be properly described for those potentials @xcite , the intrinsic nature of the landau - zener phenomena , as well as , the proposed model require to justify the plausibility of the chosen parameters .",
    "let us consider the potential @xmath147 where @xmath148 and the parameter @xmath149 incorporates the asymmetry . in fig .",
    "[ af1 ] we show the energy spectrum , as well as , the single - particle wave functions corresponding to different values of @xmath149 . from this figure",
    "we observe several features .",
    "as expected , the energy levels are arranged in bands of two levels .",
    "the energy difference between bands becomes similar to the energy difference intra - bands as the asymmetry in the potential grows .",
    "that is , as the asymmetry in the double - well potential , represented by the parameter @xmath150 changes with time @xmath151 , the energy spacing between bands starts to match the energy difference among levels in the bands .",
    "this fact imposes a restriction on the possible values of the @xmath6 parameter . in principle",
    ", one could think that the suitable range for values of @xmath6 is severely limited .",
    "however , we recall that in our calculations all the parameters are referred to the tunnelling coupling parameter @xmath46 , which is related to the energy difference of the two first energy levels at @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) as @xmath154 @xcite , being @xmath155 and @xmath156 the ground state and the first excited state energies of the single particle .",
    "therefore , by restricting ourselves to those values of @xmath157 and @xmath158 , being @xmath159 the energy difference among bands , we can validate the one - band scheme to determine the dynamics of the proposed model hamiltonian .",
    "for the chosen double - well potential ( [ twell ] ) we found @xmath160 and consequently @xmath161 .",
    "thus , for values of @xmath162 the choice of parameters in the simulations and our model are well justified .",
    "99                                we use the nelder - mead simplex method to find the minimum of the surface defined by @xmath163 and @xmath164 for the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian ( [ hmodel ] ) wth fixed @xmath22 . numerical recipes in c. the art of scientific computing , 2nd edition , 1992 ."
