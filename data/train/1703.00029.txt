    "with the recent successful detection of gravitational waves , and the reasonable expectation of more to follow , there will soon be a wealth of new information about the universe allowing ever more detailed questions to be asked .",
    "but the computational methods that have served us well for today s questions may well prove to be inadequate for the questions that arise in the near future .",
    "so it seems that there is good reason to continue to develop new approaches to computational general relativity .",
    "one such approach , known as smooth lattice general relativity , will be described in this paper . as its name suggests it",
    "is based on a lattice and it employs a metric that is locally smooth .",
    "the smooth lattice method differs from traditional numerical methods in computational general relativity in a number of important aspects .",
    "the space - time manifold consists of a large collection of overlapping computational cells with local riemann normal coordinates used in each cell .",
    "the computational cells are a set of vertices and legs that define small subsets of the manifold .",
    "the use of local riemann normal coordinates in each each cell not only reduces the complexity of the evolution equations but it also explicitly incorporates the einstein equivalence principle into the formalism .",
    "the lattice method provides an elegant separation between the topological properties of the space - time ( by specifying combinatoric data such as the connections between cells , vertices etc . ) and the metric properties ( by specifying data such as leg - lengths , curvature components etc . within each cell ) .",
    "a key element of the lattice method is that it uses the second bianchi identities to evolve the riemann curvatures .",
    "more details of the lattice method will be given later in section ( [ sec : smoothlattices ] ) .",
    "previous applications of the lattice method includes the schwarzschild  @xcite , oppenheimer - snyder  @xcite and kasner  @xcite space - times .",
    "though these were important tests of the lattice method , they lacked some of the more challenging aspects expected in full 3-dimensional computational general relativity , in particular the presence of gravitational waves and their interactions with the outer boundaries on a finite computational grid . in this",
    "paper evolutions of a smooth lattice with zero shift for the gowdy  @xcite , brill  @xcite and teukolsky  @xcite spacetimes will be presented .",
    "the objective is not to explore any new features of these space - times but rather to use them as examples of the smooth lattice method .",
    "the boundaries in the gowdy space - time will be handled using standard periodic boundary conditions while the brill and teukolsky space - times will require an out outgoing radiation condition .",
    "the brill space - time adds the extra complexity of the numerical instabilities that arise from the use of a lattice adapted to the axisymmetry .",
    "these issues will be addressed in the following sections .",
    "this class of space - times has been studied extensively by other authors .",
    "see  @xcite for the gowdy space - time , @xcite for brill waves and @xcite for teukolsky waves .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the notation used in this paper will be defined in the following section .",
    "sections ( [ sec : smoothlattices],[sec : cauchyevol ] ) provide a broad summary of the smooth lattice method including details of the evolution equations on a typical lattice .",
    "the specific details of the lattice , the construction of the initial data and the evolution equations for each of the three spacetimes are given sections ( [ sec : gowdyintro],[sec : brillintro],[sec : teukolskywaves ] ) .",
    "this is followed by a short discussion on the use of the einstein toolkit  @xcite before the results are presented in section ( [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "most of the algebraic calculations are deferred to the appendices ( [ sec : transmatrix][sec : fullriemanneqtns ] ) .",
    "throughout this paper greek letters will denote space - time indices while spatial indices will be denoted by just three latin letters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the remaining latin letters will serve as vertex labels .",
    "one small exception to these rules will be noted in appendix  ( [ sec : cartaneqtns ] ) where latin indices will be used ( extensively ) to record frame components for differential forms .",
    "the coordinates for a typical riemann normal frame will be denoted by either @xmath2 or @xmath3 while globally defined coordinates will be denoted by the addition of a tilde such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "a tilde will also be used to denote tensor components in the global frame , e.g. , @xmath6 would be the @xmath7 component of the tensor @xmath8 in the global coordinate frame .",
    "note that the global coordinates are not an essential part of the smooth lattice method .",
    "they appear in this paper solely to assist in setting the initial data and also when comparing the evolved data against the exact solution or against data obtained by other numerical means ( e.g. , a finite difference code ) .",
    "a key element of the smooth lattice method is that it employs many local riemann normal frames .",
    "this introduces a minor bookkeeping issue  if a tensor is defined across two frames , how should its components in each frame be recorded ?",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be the riemann normal frames associated with the pair of vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 . consider a vector @xmath13 defined over this pair of frames .",
    "then the components , in the frame @xmath10 , of the vector @xmath13 at vertex @xmath11 will be denoted by @xmath14 while @xmath15 denotes the components , in @xmath9 , of @xmath13 at @xmath11 .",
    "similar notation will be used for other tensors , for example @xmath16 would denote the components of the ricci tensor at the vertex @xmath17 in the frame @xmath18 .",
    "it is customary to denote the cauchy time parameter by the symbol @xmath19 .",
    "however , that symbol is reserved for the time coordinate of a typical local riemann normal frame and thus some other symbol is required , for example @xmath20 with a corresponding time derivative operator @xmath21 .",
    "the proliferation of tildes that would follow from this choice can be avoided with the following convention  replace @xmath21 with @xmath22 and take the @xmath22 to be the time derivative operator associated with the cauchy time parameter @xmath20 .",
    "this convention applies only to the operator @xmath22 , thus a ( partial ) time derivative such as @xmath23 should be understood as a derivative with respect to the riemann normal coordinate @xmath19 .",
    "the signature for the metric , riemann and ricci tensors follows that of misner , thorne and wheeler  @xcite .",
    "a smooth lattice is a discrete entity endowed with sufficient structure to allow it to be used as a useful approximation to a smooth geometry ( which in the context of computational general relativity is taken to be a solution of the einstein equations ) .",
    "the typical elements of a smooth lattice are combinatoric data such as vertices , legs , etc . and geometric data such as a coordinates , the riemann and metric tensors and any other geometric data needed to make the approximation to the smooth geometry meaningful .",
    "an @xmath24-dimensional smooth lattice can be considered as a generalisation of an @xmath24-dimensional piecewise linear manifold . the later",
    "are constructed by gluing together a collection of flat @xmath24-simplices in such a way as to ensure that the resulting object is an @xmath24-dimensional manifold , that the points common to any pair of @xmath24-simplices form sub - spaces of dimension @xmath25 or less and that the metric is continuous across the interface between every pair of connected @xmath24-simplices .    in a smooth lattice",
    "the cells need not be simplices , they are required to overlap with their neighbours and the curvature may be non - zero throughout each cell .",
    "the picture to bear in mind is that the cells of a smooth lattice are akin to the collection of coordinate charts that one would normally use to cover a manifold .",
    "the overlap between each pair of charts is non - trivial and allows for coordinate transformations between neighbouring charts .",
    "so too for the smooth lattice ",
    "each pair of neighbouring cells overlap to the extent that a well defined transition function can be constructed .",
    "this is an essential element of the smooth lattice formalism  it is used extensively when computing various source terms in the equations that control the evolution of the lattice ( see appendix ( [ sec : transmatrix ] ) for further details ) .",
    "another important feature of the smooth lattice is that each cell of the lattice need not be flat .",
    "the intention here is to better allow the smooth lattice to approximate smooth geometries than could otherwise be achieved using piecewise flat simplices ( compare the approximation of a sphere by spherical triangles as opposed to flat triangles ) .",
    "the smooth lattice should also provide smoothly varying estimates for various quantities ( for example the geodesic length of a leg ) in the overlap region between a pair of cells .",
    "the use of the adjective _ smooth _ in the name _ smooth lattice _ is intended to capture the idea that all quantities on the lattice should vary smoothly ( as best as possible ) across the lattice .",
    "denote the smooth geometry by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the metric on the @xmath24-dimensional manifold @xmath28 .",
    "a smooth lattice representation of @xmath26 can be constructed in a number of stages , in particular , choose a set of cells @xmath29 that cover @xmath28 , add the vertices and legs and finally add the metric data to the lattice .",
    "the cells @xmath29 must be chosen so that each point in @xmath28 is contained in at least one @xmath30 and each point in each @xmath30 should also be a point in @xmath28 .",
    "now decorate @xmath28 by introducing a set of vertices @xmath31 and a set of legs @xmath32 as follows .",
    "add one or more vertices to each cell and in each cell label one of these as the central vertex for that cell ( which will later serve as the origin of a set of coordinates local to the cell ) .",
    "thus each cell will contain one central vertex as well as other vertices ( which are also the central vertices of other neighbouring cells ) .",
    "the legs @xmath32 of the lattice are chosen as the geodesics that connects the central vertices between pairs of neighbouring cells .",
    "paths other than geodesics could be used but since the geodesic is defined intrinsically by the underlying smooth geometry it is a natural choice .",
    "there is , however , the issue of the uniqueness of the geodesic  if the curvature is too large or the vertices too far apart there may not exist a unique geodesic joining the pair of vertices .",
    "this problem can be overcome by a suitable choice of cells  in regions where the curvature is large the cells should be small and closely packed while in other regions , where the curvature is weak , the cells can be well spaced out .",
    "it is well known that such a construction is always possible ( in the absence of curvature singularities ) .",
    "the next step in the construction is to assign metric data to the cells . in each cell",
    "@xmath30 , expand the metric around the central vertex in terms of a local set of riemann normal coordinates @xmath33 ( see  @xcite ) , that is @xmath34 the coefficients @xmath35 , @xmath36 etc . can be obtained by projecting their corresponding quantities from the smooth metric onto a local orthonormal basis on the central vertex .    at this stage",
    "the lattice is an exact copy of the original smooth geometry but with additional structure ( the vertices , legs , cells , coordinates etc . ) .",
    "the approximation is introduced by truncating the series expansion for the metric at some finite order .",
    "the lattice will then no longer be an exact copy of the original smooth metric and should be considered an entity in its own right and will be denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the original smooth geometry will now be denoted by @xmath38 .    for the space - times considered in this paper the metric in each cell",
    "will be taken as @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "this form of the metric will lead to estimates for the geodesic lengths that differ from that given by @xmath38 . by inspection of the ( [ eqn : dsexact ] ) and ( [ eqn : dsapprox ] ) it is",
    "should be clear that for a typical leg @xmath41 in @xmath42 and @xmath28 , the geodesic lengths , using the two metrics @xmath43 and @xmath27 , will differ by a term of order @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath32 are estimates of the largest curvatures and lengths in any of the cells that contain this leg .",
    "if @xmath41 is a leg in the smooth lattice then the ( squared ) geodesic length can be estimated ( see  @xcite ) on the smooth lattice using @xmath46 where where @xmath47",
    ". of course other sources of truncation errors will arise as part of the numerical evolution of the lattice data so this @xmath44 truncation is the best that can expected at this level of approximation . to obtain higher order approximations",
    "would require not only retaining more terms in the series expansion for the metric but would also require the cells to overlap beyond nearest neighbours .",
    "imagine for the moment that the truncation errors on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : rnclsqpq ] ) where discarded .",
    "this leaves one equation that links the vertex coordinates , the leg lengths and the curvatures .",
    "it might be thought that given sufficiently many leg - lengths that the curvatures and coordinates could be computed by solving ( [ eqn : rnclsqpq ] ) .",
    "past experience shows that even though the equations can be solved ( in some cases ) the resulting evolution of the lattice did not converge to the continuum space - time .",
    "it was found that correct evolutions could be obtained by evolving either the leg - lengths and curvatures or equally by evolving the coordinates and the curvatures .",
    "both approaches will be discussed in more detail in section ( [ sec : dotlegs ] ) .",
    "the construction of the smooth lattice as described above would naturally lead , for the case of computational general relativity , to a structure that is discrete in both space and time .",
    "there is , however , an alternative picture in which the lattice evolves smoothly in time while retaining its discrete spatial structure .",
    "this allows for a fairly simple construction of a cauchy initial value problem on such a lattice ( as described later in the following section . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", the smooth lattice , its coordinates , leg lengths and riemann curvatures should be considered to evolve smoothly with time .",
    "suppose that the spacetime @xmath38 can be foliated by a one parameter family of spatial hypersurfaces @xmath48 ( i.e. , each @xmath48 is a cauchy surface in @xmath38 ) .",
    "each element of this family could be represented by a lattice with 3-dimensional computational cells denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "the 4-dimensional computational cells @xmath30 of @xmath28 will be taken as the space - time volume swept out by the corresponding @xmath49 for an infinitesimal increment in the cauchy time parameter @xmath20 .",
    "thus a single @xmath30 is a 4-dimensional cylinder , with a 3-dimensional base @xmath49 , that connects a pair of infinitesimally close cauchy surfaces while the set of all @xmath50 fills out the space - time region between that pair of cauchy surfaces .",
    "the dynamical variables on a smooth lattice can be chosen to include the riemann curvatures on the central vertex and either the ( squared ) leg - lengths or the riemann normal coordinates for each vertex in each cell . in either case",
    ", the addition of the extrinsic curvatures ( at the central vertex ) allows the full set of evolution equations for the lattice to be given in first order form .      in the standard formulation of the cauchy initial value problem for general relativity the lapse function and shift vectors",
    "can be freely specified at each point in the space - time .",
    "this naturally carries over to the smooth lattice by allowing the lapse function and shift vector to be freely specified on the central vertex of each cell .    in computational general relativity",
    "it is usually the case that once the lapse function and shift vector have been fully specified then there are no remaining coordinate freedoms .",
    "this is not exactly true on a smooth lattice ",
    "each cell carries its own local set of coordinates and specifying the lapse and shift at one point in that cell is not sufficient to properly constrain the coordinates on the remaining vertices .",
    "what remains is the freedom to orient the coordinate axes within each cell . thus using boosts and spatial rotations",
    "the @xmath19-axis can be aligned with the world - line of the central vertex ( for the case of zero shift ) while the spatial axes can be given some preferred alignment with some of the remaining vertices of the cell . ) .",
    "] this is a choice that depends on the structure of the cells and possibly on any symmetries that might exist in the space - time .    in each of the space - times considered in this paper the shift vector",
    "will be set equal to zero ( i.e. , the world - lines of the vertices will be normal to the cauchy surfaces ) while the lapse function will be given as a function on the set of central vertices .",
    "the only legs that will be evolved in a cell are those that are directly connected to the central vertex .",
    "there are two reasons for making this choice .",
    "first , legs that are not tied to the central vertex are likely to incur a larger truncation error than legs closer to the central vertex ( such as those tied to that vertex ) .",
    "second , there is no contribution to the leg - length from the riemann tensor for legs directly connected to the central vertex thus avoiding any issues of accounting for time derivatives of such terms .",
    "consider a typical cell with central vertex @xmath51 and let @xmath52 be any of its vertices .",
    "a standard result from differential geometry , known as the first variation of arc - length  @xcite , states that for a one - parameter family of geodesics , the arc - length @xmath53 will evolve according to @xmath54_o^q\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the ( forward pointing ) unit tangent vector to the geodesic , @xmath56 is the ( future pointing ) unit tangent vector to the vertex world - line and @xmath57 is the lapse function . for a short leg , where the lapse and extrinsic curvatures are approximately constant across the leg , this result can be estimated by  @xcite @xmath58 since @xmath57 and @xmath59",
    "are defined on the vertices there is an ambiguity in attempting to apply this equation to any leg  each leg",
    "is defined by two vertices so which vertex should supply the required values ?",
    "as there is no clear reason to prefer one vertex over the other it seems reasonable to take the average from both vertices , that is ) as shown in appendix ( [ sec : evolvelenoq ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath60    a simple generalisation of this result can be obtained by noting that any 3-geodesic within a cauchy surface can be arbitrarily approximated by a large sequence of short 4-geodesics of the space - time .",
    "the arc - length for each short 4-geodesic is subject to the above evolution equation and thus , on summing over all contributions to the path and taking a suitable limit , it follows that @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the proper distance along the path and @xmath63 is the arc - length of the 3-geodesic .",
    "using this equation to evolve the leg - lengths requires a re - appraisal of how the legs of the lattice are interpreted . in the standard formulation  @xcite , the legs of the lattice are geodesics in space - time ( and will appear as chords connecting the vertices ) whereas in this alternative interpretation the geodesics now lie entirely within a cauchy surface .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ eqn : integraldotl ] ) is suitable for simple lattices , such as the gowdy lattice , where information about @xmath57 and @xmath59 can be deduced along the entire path . in all other cases , such as the brill and teukolsky lattices , the former evolution equation ( [ eqn : firstvariationb ] )",
    "must be used .    as the leg - lengths evolve",
    ", so too must the riemann normal coordinates .",
    "so it is natural to ask : what are the appropriate evolution equations for the @xmath64 ?",
    "a simple calculation , as detailed in  @xcite , shows that for any vertex @xmath17 in a cell @xmath65 a short independent derivation of this equation can also be found in appendix ( [ sec : evolvernc ] ) .",
    "note that in choosing to evolve the coordinates , the freedom to adapt the coordinates to the lattice , as described in section ( [ sec : lapseshift ] ) , can only be imposed either on the initial cauchy surface or at future times by applying suitable rotations .      in  @xcite the evolution equations for the extrinsic curvatures where given for the particular case of a unit lapse .",
    "the method employed in that paper can be easily repeated for the more general case of a non - constant lapse .",
    "the results are as follows @xmath66      \\label{eqn : dotkabb }        \\dotkyy & = -\\dnyy + n \\left(\\rtyty + \\kyy^2 - \\kxy^2 - \\kyz^2\\right)\\\\[5pt ]      \\label{eqn : dotkabc }        \\dotkzz & = -\\dnzz + n \\left(\\rtztz + \\kzz^2 - \\kxz^2 - \\kyz^2\\right)\\\\[5pt ]      \\label{eqn : dotkabd }        \\dotkxy & = -\\dnxy + n \\left(\\rtxty - \\kxz\\kyz \\right)\\\\[5pt ]      \\label{eqn : dotkabe }        \\dotkxz & = -\\dnxz + n \\left(\\rtxtz - \\kxy\\kyz \\right)\\\\[5pt ]      \\label{eqn : dotkabf }        \\dotkyz & = -\\dnyz + n \\left(\\rtytz - \\kxy\\kxz \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations apply at the central vertex where , in the riemann normal frame of this vertex , @xmath67 and where the covariant derivatives @xmath68 coincides with the partial derivatives @xmath69 .",
    "in 4-dimensions there are 20 algebraically independent components of the riemann tensor at any one point and in each cell these are taken to be @xmath70 of these , the first 14 will be evolved while the remaining 6 will be set by applying the vacuum einstein equations ( see section ( [ sec : vacuumeqtns ] ) ) .    the evolution equations for the riemann curvatures are based upon the second bianchi identities . at the origin of the local frame ( i.e. , the central vertex )",
    "the connection vanishes and thus these equations take the simple form ",
    "@xmath71 there is , however , a small bump in the road in using these equations to evolve the curvatures  the only data immediately available are the point values for the curvatures in each cell and thus some process must be applied to estimate the partial derivatives in each cell .",
    "it is possible to use a finite difference approximation using data from neighbouring cells but in doing so a proper account must be made of the different orientations of the neighbouring frames .",
    "this is clearly true for the spatial derivatives where neighbouring frames may differ by boosts and rotations .",
    "it is also true for the time derivatives due to progression of boosts needed to keep the world - line of the origin of the local frame normal to the cauchy surfaces .",
    "thus @xmath72 , for example , will consist not only of the raw partial derivatives ( i.e. , taking the raw data from neighbouring frames without regard for coordinate transformations ) but also of terms that account for the boosts and rotations between neighbouring frames .",
    "the details are spelt out in full , for the particular class of lattices used in this paper , in appendix ( [ sec : sourceterms ] ) leading to expression such as @xmath73 in which the @xmath74 are the raw partial derivatives of @xmath75 and the @xmath76 are geometrical data built solely from the structure of the lattice ( i.e. , they depend only on the leg - lengths and riemann normal coordinates ) .",
    "this result is very much like the usual definition of a covariant derivative .",
    "this does of course lead to a significant increase in the number of terms in each equation .",
    "the full set of equations ( for a zero shift ) can be found in appendix ( [ sec : fullriemanneqtns ] ) .",
    "the second bianchi identities provide no information about the time derivatives of the riemann components such as @xmath77 . consequently such components can not be evolved but rather must be determined algebraically by applying the ( vacuum ) einstein equations .",
    "thus the 6 curvatures @xmath78 are obtained from @xmath79      the constraints consist not only of the four standard hamiltonian and momentum constraints , which on a lattice take the form @xmath80 but also the extra constraints that arise from allowing the riemann curvatures to be evolved .",
    "these constraints follow from the second bianchi identities , namely @xmath81 note that @xmath82 is not one of the 20 chosen @xmath75 but it can be computed directly using @xmath83 .",
    "polarised gowdy cosmologies on @xmath84 are a class of solutions of the vacuum einstein equations that posses two linearly independent spatial killing vectors .",
    "the metric , in coordinates adapted to the symmetries , is commonly written in the form  @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are functions of @xmath88 and where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the two killing vectors .",
    "each of the spatial coordinates @xmath91 are required to be periodic ( to respect the @xmath92 topology ) .",
    "the functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 used in this paper are those given by new - watt etal  @xcite , namely , @xmath93 with @xmath94 restricted to @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the domain for @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be chosen as any finite interval , e.g. , @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "the metric is singular only at @xmath99 and consequently initial data should be set at some other time ( e.g. , at @xmath100 as described below ) .",
    "the gowdy initial data will be evolved away from the @xmath99 singularity .      a lattice that represents the spatial part of this metric is rather easy to construct .",
    "start by discretising the @xmath94 axis into a finite number of points labelled from @xmath101 to @xmath102 with the point labelled @xmath101 identified with that labelled @xmath102 ( i.e. , two labels for a single point ) .",
    "these points will soon be identified as the vertices of the lattice .",
    "note that there are no legs at this stage , these will be added later .",
    "now use the killing vectors @xmath103 and @xmath104 to drag the discretised @xmath94 axis along the @xmath96 and @xmath97 axis .",
    "the legs of the lattice can now be constructed as the space - time geodesics that connect pairs of points ( now taken as vertices of the lattice ) .",
    "this leads to the simple lattice shown in figure ( [ fig : gowdylattice ] ) consisting of @xmath102 computational cells labelled from @xmath101 to @xmath102 with cell @xmath101 identified with cell @xmath102 .",
    "this lattice contains three classes of legs , one for each of the three coordinate axes , namely , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "other data that must be carried by the lattice include the extrinsic curvatures , @xmath59 , the riemann curvatures , @xmath75 and the lapse function @xmath57 .",
    "consider a typical computational cell , as shown in figure ( [ fig : gowdylattice ] ) , and ask the question : how should the riemann normal frame be constructed ?",
    "let @xmath107 be the unit basis vectors for the riemann normal frame .",
    "now choose the origin of the riemann normal frame to be ( permanently ) attached to the central vertex .",
    "next , use boosts to ensure that @xmath108 is normal to the cauchy surface , then use rotations to ensure that the vertices of @xmath106 lie on the @xmath109-axis and also for the vertices of @xmath110 to lie in the @xmath111-plane . given the symmetries of the gowdy space - time it is no hard to appreciate that the @xmath2 coordinates of the seven vertices of the cell @xmath112 will be of the following form @xmath113 where the time coordinate is given by @xmath114 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "note that this construction also ensures that the riemann normal axes are aligned with their gowdy counterparts ( as a consequence of the gowdy metric being diagonal ) .",
    "a straightforward computation on the gowdy metric reveals that there are three non - trivial extrinsic curvatures , @xmath115 and @xmath116 and five non - trivial riemann curvatures , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the lattice values for the extrinsic and riemann curvatures , @xmath59 and @xmath75 , were computed by projecting their counterparts , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , onto the local riemann normal frame .",
    "this provides not only a way to identify the non - trivial components on the lattice but also a simple way to assign the initial data .",
    "the leg - lengths @xmath105 and @xmath106 were set as follows .",
    "the @xmath110 were computed as the length of the geodesic connecting @xmath121 to @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "a similar approach was used to compute the @xmath124 this time using the points @xmath121 and @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "a common value for @xmath106 was chosen for all cells , namely @xmath127 this in turn required the @xmath94 coordinate to be unequally spaced from cell to cell .",
    "starting with @xmath128 the successive @xmath129 for @xmath130 where found by treating the equation @xmath131 as a non - linear equation for @xmath132 given @xmath133 .",

    "the expected behaviour for the brill wave is that the curvature will be propagated away from the symmetry axis with the wave hitting the edges of the outer boundary by about @xmath314 followed by the four corners by about @xmath315 and will completely cross the boundary by about @xmath228 .",

    "in contrast the lattice data shows a smooth behaviour in the wave with no apparent boundary waves nor any sign of a bump . by @xmath228 ( see figure ( [ fig : brillprofile10 ] ) ) the adm data shows not only the boundary waves but also reflected waves from the outer boundary .",

    "it is reasonable to ask why the three methods should give such different results in the region behind the main wave .",
    "the smooth profile in the lattice data might be due to the large dissipation parameter compared to that used in the adm and bssn data .",

    "these show that the constraints appear to decrease as @xmath102 is increased .",
    "it also appears that the constraints settle to a non - zero value as @xmath19 increases .",
    "this could be due to truncation errors inherent in the solution of the hamiltonian equation ( [ eqn : brillh ] ) coupled with the interpolation to the lattice ( though this claim was not tested ) .",
    "the two bumps in the left figure , one just after @xmath314 and one close to @xmath228 are most likely due to reflections from the outer boundary ( this too was not tested ) .",
    "the teukolsky data is specified on a full 3-dimensional grid / lattice and is thus not susceptible to the axis instability seen in the brill data .",
    "this allows for a much smaller dissipation parameter to be used for the lattice , adm and bssn codes , in this case @xmath313 .",
    "the results for the teukolsky initial data are shown figures ( [ fig : teukprofile05][fig : teukbctest ] ) and bear some similarities with the results for the brill initial data . however , in this case the boundary and reflected waves appear to be much less noticeable while the bump in the bssn data is still present and is more pronounced than in the brill wave data .",
    "the plots in figure ( [ fig : teukbump ] ) show that the bump in the bssn data is a numerical artefact .",
    "the figure shows that as the spatial resolution is decreased ( i.e. , increasing @xmath102 ) the amplitude of the bump , at @xmath314 , decreases .",
    "the figure also shows that the amplitude of the bump grows with time .",
    "no attempt was made to determine the source of the bump .    in order to better understand the influence of the outer boundary condition on the evolution",
    "it was decided to run the lattice , adm and bssn codes on two different sets of initial data , each with the same spatial resolution but with one grid twice the size of the other ( i.e. , one grid had boundaries at @xmath322 and the other at @xmath323 ) .",
    "the influence of the outer boundary condition on the evolution was then be measured by comparing the evolution on the common region .",

    "the left panel shows the difference in @xmath206 between the two grids for the lattice data ( red curve ) and for the bssn data ( green curve , using @xmath324 and @xmath325 ) .",
    "this shows clearly that the boundary waves for both methods are present well before the main wave hits the boundary .",
    "it also shows that the amplitude for the bssn data is much larger than for the lattice data .",
    "note also that the boundary waves do not propagate very far into the grid ( in stark contrast to the adm brill waves ) .",
    "by @xmath228 the main wave has left the smaller grid and the data in the left panel describes a mix of waves dominated by the reflected waves .",
    "this figure also shows that the bssn data contains a long wavelength mode while the waves in the lattice data are much smaller in amplitude and are dominated by high frequency modes ( which are rapidly suppressed by the numerical dissipation ) .",
    "the evolution of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eqn : teukconstc1 ] ) is shown in figure ( [ fig : teukconstc1 ] ) .",
    "the linear growth in the constraint for the bssn data is due solely to the growth of the bssn bump at the origin .",
    "the sharp rise in the constraint for the lattice data for @xmath319 is due to the onset of a small instability in the lattice near the origin .",
    "this can also be seen in the small bump in the lower right plot of figure ( [ fig : teukbctest ] ) .",
    "this instability can be suppressed by increasing the dissipation parameter but at the expense of compromising the quality of the evolution .",
    "the source of this instability is thought to be due to the residual extrinsic curvatures driving the lattice vertices in different directions leading to distorted computational cells that break the near - planar assumptions built into the derivation of equations ( [ eqn : finalmabceqtns ] ) .",
    "this is an important issue for the viability of the lattice method and will be explored in more detail in subsequent work .",
    "the passage of the waves through the outer boundaries appear to be better handled by the lattice method than both the adm and bssn methods .",
    "this is particularly true for the brill waves but less so for the teukolsky waves .",
    "it is reasonable to ask if this is a generic feature of the lattice method and if so , then which features of the lattice method gives rise to this result ?",
    "an argument can be made that this behaviour may well be germane to the lattice method .",
    "the basis of the argument is the simple observation that in any small region of space - time covered by riemann normal coordinates the first order coupled evolution equations for the riemann curvatures ( [ eqn : dotrabcda][eqn : dotrabcdn ] ) can be de - coupled to second order equations in which the principle part is the wave operator .",

    "the natural outgoing boundary condition for this wave equation is the sommerfeld condition as per equation ( [ eqn : brillouterbc ] ) .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the lattice method works as well as it does .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the use of riemann normal coordinates . in a generic set of coordinates the principle part would not be the wave operator .    as encouraging as the results may appear to be there remain many questions about the method .",

    "how can mesh refinement be implemented ?",
    "how well does it work on purely tetrahedral meshes ?",
    "how well does it work for non - unit lapse functions ?",
    "how can black holes be incorporated into a lattice ( punctures or trapped surfaces ? ) and how would these holes move through the lattice ?",
    "how can energy flux , adm mass and other asymptotic quantities be computed on a lattice ?",
    "these are all important question and must answered before the lattice method can be considered for serious work in computational general relativity .",
    "these questions will be addressed in later papers .",
    "the transition matrices play a central role in the computation of the derivatives such as @xmath328 .",
    "they are used to import data from neighbouring cells so that the vertices of a chosen cell are populated with data expressed in the frame of that cell .",
    "a finite difference estimate can then be made for the required partial derivatives .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to extend the approach given in  @xcite . in that paper particular attention",

    "a simple and natural choice is to locate the origin on the central vertex and to align the coordinate axes with various sub - spaces of the cell ( e.g. , align the @xmath137-axis to the leg @xmath333 , the @xmath138-axis to the plane spanned by the legs @xmath333 and @xmath334 etc . ) .    without further information about the relationship of one cell to another little",
    "can be said about the corresponding transition matrices",

    "this form of @xmath28 ensures that it converges to the identity matrix in the continuum limit ( e.g. , by successive refinements of the cubic lattice ) .",
    "note that the @xmath337 must be subject to a constraint since the resulting transition matrix must preserve scalar products .",
    "that is , for any pair of vectors @xmath338 and @xmath13 , @xmath339 which leads immediately to @xmath340 this shows that the @xmath341 define a skew - symmetric @xmath342 matrix determined by just six independent entries ( corresponding to three boosts and three rotations ) .",

    "this leads to the following set of equations @xmath357 now since each @xmath358 it follows that the right hand side of ( [ eqn : improvedmabceqtns ] ) is @xmath359 and thus @xmath360 which allows the terms @xmath361 and @xmath362 on the right hand side of [ eqn : improvedmabceqtns ] to be replaced by their counterparts leading to @xmath363 finally note that @xmath364 and therefore @xmath365 these are the equations that were used in the computer code to compute the @xmath76 .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : antisymmmab ] ) and ( [ eqn : finalmabceqtns ] ) bear a striking similarity to the cartan structure equations @xmath366 in which @xmath367 are the basis 1-forms , @xmath368 are the connection 1-forms and where the metric is given by @xmath369 with @xmath370 .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to show how equations ( [ eqn : antisymmmab ] ) and ( [ eqn : finalmabceqtns ] ) can be obtained from the cartan structure equations ( [ eqn : firstcartan ] ) and ( [ eqn : secondcartan ] ) .    to start the ball rolling , note that equations ( [ eqn : antisymmmab ] ) and ( [ eqn : firstcartan ] ) agree upon choosing @xmath371 .",
    "showing that the remaining pair of equations ( [ eqn : finalmabceqtns ] ) and ( [ eqn : secondcartan ] ) agree requires a bit more work .",
    "start by integrating ( [ eqn : secondcartan ] ) over the tile @xmath45 defined by the vertices @xmath372 in figure ( [ fig : cartanconn ] ) @xmath373 where @xmath368 has been expanded as @xmath374 .",
    "this equation can be re - written using stoke s theorem as @xmath375 the path integral on the left can be split into four pieces , one the four edges of the tile . on each edge set @xmath376 where @xmath377 are the local riemann",
    "normal coordinates appropriate to the edge ( e.g. , along the edge @xmath378 use the coordinates of frame @xmath352 ) .",
    "thus @xmath379 where @xmath380 .",
    "the area integral on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : integratedcartan ] ) can be estimated to leading order in the length scale @xmath32 by approximating @xmath381 by its value at the vertex @xmath51 .",
    "thus @xmath382 and noting that the integrand on the right is just the area 2-form for the tile leads to the estimate @xmath383 the integrated form of the cartan equation ( [ eqn : integratedcartan ] ) can now be re - written as @xmath384 which agrees ( apart from the greek / latin indices ) , to leading order in @xmath32 , with ( [ eqn : finalmabceqtns ] ) provided @xmath385 .",
    "a lattice would normally consist of a finite number of local frames , one for each central vertex .",
    "but there is nothing to stop the construction of a local frame at every point in the lattice .",
    "the new frames could be introduced by any rule but for a smooth lattice it is reasonable to require that the frames vary smoothly across the lattice",
    ". this will certainly be the case when the transition matrices are of the form @xmath386 the addition of these extra frames makes it easier to discuss differentiation on the lattice .",
    "consider a cell @xmath17 and some point @xmath52 within that cell .",
    "let @xmath55 be the components of a typical vector at @xmath52 expressed in the local frame of @xmath52 , that is @xmath387 .",
    "the components of the vector in the frame @xmath331 would then be given by @xmath388 .",
    "this allows the derivatives of @xmath55 at @xmath17 and in @xmath331 to be computed as follows @xmath389    at this point there is a slight problem with the notation . the last term on the right hand side above is a derivative of @xmath55 formed from the raw point values of the @xmath55 .",
    "that derivative takes no account of the transition matrices and thus is not the partial derivative ( indeed the partial derivative is the term on the left hand side ) . to emphasise",
    "this distinction the following notation will be used . define a new derivative operator @xmath390 by derivatives need not commute . ]",
    "@xmath391 then the equation ( [ eqn : derivva ] ) can be written as @xmath392 where it is understood that all terms are evaluated at @xmath17 and in @xmath331 . by following a similar line of reasoning",
    "it is not hard to see that , for example , @xmath393 as a consistency check it is rather easy to see that applying this notation to @xmath394 leads directly to equation ( [ eqn : antisymmmab ] ) . to see that this is so first note that @xmath395 at every vertex @xmath52 and thus the derivatives @xmath396 are zero everywhere .",
    "this leads immediately to equation ( [ eqn : antisymmmab ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the hessian of lapse @xmath397 could be computed entirely from data within a single frame or by sharing data , such as @xmath398 , between neighbouring frames . in the later case",
    "some care must be taken when computing terms like @xmath399 since the colon derivatives need not commute . while @xmath400 and as @xmath401 it follows that @xmath402 which in general will not be zero . ]",
    "in a lattice that is discrete in both space and time there would be 24 distinct @xmath76 in each computational cell .",
    "however , in the case of a continuous time lattice with a zero shift vector at each central vertex , 15 of the 24 @xmath76 can be expressed in terms of the lapse function @xmath57 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath403 , namely @xmath404    the key to this computation will be the application of ( [ eqn : simplemabceqtns ] ) to two carefully chosen tiles , in particular a time - like tile ( generated by the evolution of a spatial leg ) and a spatial tile ( where all of the vertices lie in one cauchy surface ) .",
    "consider a spatial tile in which all of the vertices of the tile lie within one cauchy surface , thus the @xmath19 component of the various @xmath55 in ( [ eqn : simplemabceqtns ] ) are zero .",
    "this leads immediately to @xmath406 where the implied sum over @xmath249 includes only the spatial terms ( since @xmath407 ) .",
    "since this equation must be true for all choices of @xmath408 it follows that @xmath409      consider now the time - like tile generated by the leg @xmath411 as it evolves between a pair of nearby cauchy surfaces ( as indicated by vertices @xmath412 in figure ( [ fig : cartanconn ] ) ) .",
    "the two time - like edges @xmath413 and @xmath414 are tangent to the world - lines normal to the cauchy surface while the space - like edges @xmath411 and @xmath415 are the two instances of the leg @xmath414 , one at time @xmath19 the other at @xmath416 . since the shift vector is assumed to vanish at each central vertex , it follows that @xmath417 likewise , for the spatial edges the @xmath55 will have a zero @xmath19 component and thus will be of the form @xmath418 for some choice of @xmath419 and @xmath420 . with this choice for the @xmath55 and noting that @xmath421 , the @xmath19 component of equation ( [ eqn : simplemabceqtns ] ) is given by @xmath422 noting that @xmath423 and estimating the left hand side by @xmath424 leads to @xmath425 and since the @xmath419 are arbitrary , it follows that @xmath426 in which it is understood that all terms are evaluated at @xmath51 in the frame @xmath356 .      this computation follows on directly from the previous computation .",
    "this time our attention is on the spatial terms of equation ( [ eqn : simplemabceqtns ] ) , namely @xmath428 now recall that @xmath347 is defined by @xmath348 and as @xmath429 it follows that @xmath430 and on taking a limit as @xmath431 leads immediately to the evolution equations @xmath432 for the coordinates @xmath433 .",
    "now take @xmath22 of @xmath434 and use equation ( [ eqn : dotlegsa ] ) to obtain @xmath435 which when combined with the above result leads to @xmath436 and as the first term on right vanishes due to @xmath437 the above can be further simplified to @xmath438 but from ( [ eqn : mtijsymm ] ) , @xmath439 , and as the @xmath440 are arbitrary ( since the vertex @xmath11 can be chosen anywhere in the cell ) the previous equation can only be true provided @xmath441 or equally @xmath442      the next task is to show that @xmath444 .",
    "this is rather easy to do .",
    "having just shown that @xmath427 means that equation ( [ eqn : dotx ] ) can also be written as @xmath445 which when compared with ( [ eqn : dotlegsa ] ) shows that @xmath446 for any choice of @xmath447 .",
    "this in turn requires @xmath444 .",
    "our aim here is to obtain evolution equations for the spatial coordinates @xmath448 of each vertex in a computational cell .    to begin , consider two points @xmath17 and @xmath52 chosen arbitrarily in a typical cell .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : dotx ] ) can be applied to this pair of points leading to @xmath449 now combine this pair by contracting ( [ eqn : dotxp ] ) with @xmath450 and ( [ eqn : dotxq ] ) with @xmath451 while noting that @xmath452 to obtain @xmath453 after shuffling terms across the equals sign this can also be re - written as @xmath454 this equation must be true for all choices of @xmath41 . as the bracketed term on the left hand side depends only on @xmath17 , that term must match the only @xmath17 dependent term on the right hand side , namely the @xmath451 .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath455     n_o\\kij x^j_{q\\bo } + \\frac{dx^i_{q\\bo}}{dt }        = - \\alpha x^i_{q\\bo}\\label{eqn : nkijalpha2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some scalar @xmath456 . but",
    "upon setting @xmath457 in ( [ eqn : nkijxpxq ] ) it follows that @xmath458 which when applied to ( [ eqn : nkijalpha1 ] ) leads to @xmath459 and thus @xmath460 .",
    "this leads immediately to @xmath461 with a similar result for the point @xmath52 .",
    "since the point @xmath17 is arbitrary it follow that this result holds for any point in the computational cell .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : firstvariationb ] ) can be obtained from ( [ eqn : firstvariationa ] ) as follows .",
    "let @xmath462 be a typical leg connected to the central vertex of some cell .",
    "our first step is to express the various vectors at @xmath51 and @xmath52 in terms of the local frames @xmath356 and @xmath18 .",
    "since the shift vector is assumed to be zero across the lattice it is follows that the unit normals take the simple form @xmath463 while @xmath464 which follows directly from the definition of riemann normal coordinates @xmath33 . recall that @xmath465 are the riemann normal coordinates of the vertex @xmath11 in the frame @xmath10 .",
    "note also that the forward pointing unit tangent vectors @xmath466 and @xmath467 are given by @xmath468 now substitute the above equations ( [ eqn : normalo][eqn : tangentq ] ) into ( [ eqn : firstvariationa ] ) to obtain @xmath469_o^q\\\\                 & = \\loq \\left(v_\\mu ( nn^\\mu)\\right)_q - \\loq \\left(v_\\mu ( nn^\\mu)\\right)_o\\\\                 & = -n_q x_{\\mu o\\bq } n^\\mu_{q\\bq } - n_o x_{\\mu q\\bo } n^\\mu_{o\\bo}\\\\                 & = n_q t_{o\\bq } + n_o t_{q\\bo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the riemann normal time coordinate .",
    "however , as shown in  @xcite , @xmath470 which using ( [ eqn : vectormo][eqn : vectormq ] ) can also be written as @xmath471 and thus @xmath472 which leads immediately to equation ( [ eqn : firstvariationb ] ) .",
    "the following are the complete set of evolution equations for the 14 riemann curvatures for the particular case of a zero shift vector .",
    "these were obtained by applying the process outlined in appendix ( [ sec : sourceterms ] ) to the second bianchi identities ( [ eqn : dotrabcda][eqn : dotrabcdn ] ) ."
