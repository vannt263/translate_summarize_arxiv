    "solar prominences ( filaments ) are made - up of dense and cool chromospheric plasma hanging in the hot and low density corona ( tandberg - hanssen 1995 ) .",
    "besides its intrinsic interest , as a natural laboratory for plasma physics , the study of these structures is also of a more general interest in the frame of space weather studies .",
    "indeed , among other closed magnetic regions such as active regions , eruptive prominences are often associated with coronal mass ejections , or cmes , that is huge plasma `` bubbles '' ejected from the solar corona and able to strongly affect sun - earth relationships , by their interactions with the terrestrial magnetosphere ( see e.g. , gopalswamy et al .",
    "2006 , for a recent review upon the various precursors of cmes ) .    despite systematic observations made since the nineteenth century and decades of study ,",
    "prominence formation mechanisms are still not well understood .",
    "in particular , yet no theory can fully explain their remarkable stability in a hotter and less dense medium .",
    "however , since the plasma @xmath0 is low in prominences , the magnetic field is very likely to play a major role in the physical scenarios which could explain prominences formation , stability and , finally , the triggering of these instabilities leading to cmes ( see fig .",
    "however , the 3d magnetic field topology of solar prominences is not _",
    "directly _ measureable in the corona .",
    "even though indirect methods are available , the best possible determination of prominences magnetic fields comes from the inversion of spectropolarimetric data , which collection still remains a difficult task .",
    "hei multiplets such as @xmath1    in the near - infrared , and the fraunhofer `` yellow line '' @xmath2 at @xmath3    are the best tools , so far , to study prominence magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , only a few spectral lines are intense enough for ground - based observations in the optical spectrum of solar prominences i.e. , at these wavelength at which spectropolarimetry is usually done .",
    "these helium multiplets provide , even if they are fainter than h@xmath4 for instance , the most suitable information necessary for the purpose of determining the magnetic field pervading the prominence plasma .",
    "indeed , h@xmath4 is generally optically thick in prominences which , together with its hyperfine atomic structure , makes this spectral line still much more difficult to deal with , as compared to the above - mentioned helium multiplets .",
    "first spectropolarimetric observations of prominences and associated results about the magnetic field properties have been recently reviewed by paletou & aulanier ( 2003 ) .",
    "after very fruitful years of observations made mostly in the 80 s , mainly at the _ pic du midi _ in france and at sacramento peak by nso and hao groups in the usa , spectropolarimetry of prominences seems to resume after the pionnering work of lin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the full - stokes observations of a filament ( i.e. , a prominence as seen on the disk ) in the @xmath1    multiplet",
    ".    a few years after , the first _ full - stokes _ and high spectral resolution observation of a prominence in the hei @xmath2 multiplet is made at thmis ( paletou et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these observations revealed a mixture of hanle and zeeman effects signatures . and the direct analysis , under the weak - field approximation , of the measured stokes @xmath5 signals pointed at a longitudinal magnetic field value of the order of 40 g , i.e. quite larger than what was usually measured in quiescent prominences ( leroy 1989 , leroy et al .",
    "1984 ) . magnetic field strengths of the order of 50 g were also reported by wiehr & bianda ( 2003 ) .",
    "the new thmis observations have also led to a revision of magnetic field inversion tools ( lpez ariste & casini 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , these authors demonstrated how taking into account _ all _ stokes parameters , and not only linear polarization signals , can increase the reliability of the inversion process .",
    "shortly after , casini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) published the first _",
    "maps _ of the vector magnetic field i.e. , its modulus , azimuth and inclination , as inferred from _ advanced stokes polarimeter _ observations made at d@xmath6 of hei , at the dunn solar tower ( dst , nso / sp , usa ) .",
    "even stronger field measurements were confirmed , up to 70 g , and variations of the orientation of the magnetic field across the prominence body were revealed .",
    "long sequences of observations , more likely provided by spaceborne observatories , offer the possibility , to a certain extent , for an indirect diagnosis of the mean magnetic field in a filament / prominence . using a 7h30 observing sequence made with the cds euv spectrometer on - board soho , and from the identification of certain oscillation modes associated to alfvn and magnetoacoustic waves , rgnier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) could infer the angle between the mean magnetic field and the filament long axis , and the magnetic field strength vs. the electronic density ( although the latter remained undetermined ) .",
    "some important properties of the magnetic field of prominences can also be deduced from vector magnetic maps made at the _ photospheric _ level , in association with h@xmath4 imagery of the area below were stands the prominence .",
    "the latter images have to be used _ simultaneously _ with the photospheric vector magnetograms , and analysed taking into account the so - called _ chirality rules _ which were established by martin ( 1998 ) .",
    "taking advantage of the multi - line capabilities of thmis , and after a delicate analysis of several sets of data , lpez ariste et al .",
    "( 2006 ) could indeed identify the presence of photospheric magnetic field dips , also known as _ bald patches _ ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . according to these authors , this observed magnetic field topology in the photosphere tends to support mhd models of prominences based on magnetic dips located within weakly twisted flux tubes .",
    "the @xmath1  multiplet of hei is routinely observed at the german vtt with the tip polarimeter developed at the iac ( mrtinez pillet et al .",
    "1999 , collados et al .",
    "filaments and prominences observations made with such instruments have recently conducted to very interesting results .    from observations of a filament at disk center , trujillo bueno et al .",
    "( 2002 ) could show , from the analysis of linear polarization signals observed in the two well - separated components of the @xmath7  multiplet , and taking advantage of the forward - scattering geometry of this observation , that the effect of selective absorption from the ground - level of the triplet system of hei is at work .",
    "this implies the presence of magnetic fields of the order of a few gauss that are highly inclined with respect to the solar radius vector .",
    "images of the filament and its environment ( from lpez ariste et al .",
    "2006 , using thmis multi - wavelength observations).,width=377 ]    more recently , merenda et al .",
    "( 2006 ) published a quite surprising result concerning the orientation of the magnetic field deduced from the observation of a _ polar crown _ prominence .",
    "a magnetic field of 30 g strength inclined by about 25@xmath8 with respect to the local solar vertical direction was inferred .",
    "these authors could also deduce from their analysis that , this nearly vertical magnetic field appeared to be slightly rotating around a fixed direction in space as one proceeds along the direction of the spectrograph s slit ( which was , in that case , parallel to the local limb ) .",
    "nowadays , the 1-m aperture class thmis solar telescope installed at the _ observatorio del teide _ in izaa ( tenerife , spain ) is the tool of choice for observing programmes dedicated to the spectropolarimetry of solar prominences . since 2006 , and the rejuvenation of the pool of detectors for the mtr observing mode ( see e.g. , paletou & molodij 2001 ) , it provides indeed a _",
    "unique _ capability of high spectral resolution , multi - line spectropolarimetric observations _",
    "simultaneously _ in the visible and in the near - infrared spectral domains .    on fig .  3",
    ", we display stokes profiles extracted from data taken on june 2007 . with our mtr setup , observations of d@xmath6 , h@xmath4 and @xmath1",
    " spectral domains are made simultaneously .",
    "for these observations , a polarimetric sensitivity better than @xmath9 was reached .",
    "such a combination of measurements with high spectral resolution and polarimetric sensitivity is , so far , a unique capability which is fully relevant for the deeper study of prominences magnetic fields in the coming years .    in the frame of our programme of spectropolarimetric observation of prominences",
    ", we could also put in evidence `` enigmatic '' circular polarization signals in h@xmath4 , both symmetric and having amplitudes which can be comparable to linear polarization signals , unlike what is predicted by the theory of the hanle effect ( see e.g. , landi deglinnocenti 1982 ) .",
    "this was confirmed by observations made at the dst with the asp spectropolarimeter ( lpez ariste et al . 2005 ) . even though other groups , such as stenflo s ( eth , zrich ) using the 45-cm aperture gregory - coud telescope at locarno with the zimpol spectropolarimeter could not yet confirm our findings ( ramelli et al .",
    "2006 ) , the analysis of data collected during our 2007 and 2008 observing campaigns do confirm the existence of such @xmath5 signals .",
    "our present study of this set of data aims at understanding under which conditions such circular polarization signals appear and , which are the physical implications of their presence or absence .",
    "there are several physical processes capable of generating the observed net circular polarization ( hereafter ncp ) at h@xmath4 and , it is still unclear which one , or which combination of effects , is indeed at work in prominences .",
    "this may result from the presence of _ electric _ fields in the prominence plasma ( see e.g. , casini & manso sainz 2006 ) .",
    "however , some authors have also shown that collisional effects , either anisotropic ( derouich 2007 ) or isotropic ( tpn & sahal - brchot , these proceedings ) , can also generate ncp .    , @xmath10 and @xmath5 are normalized to the maximum of @xmath11 after removal of the scattered light .",
    "h@xmath4 was also observed simultaneously with our mtr set - up .",
    "polarization signals displayed here have been obtained with a sensitivity better than @xmath12.,width=340 ]    , @xmath10 and @xmath5 are normalized to the maximum of @xmath11 after removal of the scattered light .",
    "h@xmath4 was also observed simultaneously with our mtr set - up .",
    "polarization signals displayed here have been obtained with a sensitivity better than @xmath12.,width=340 ]",
    "it happens that measurements of the ratio between the amplitude of the two components of stokes @xmath11 , resulting from the atomic fine structure , for the hei @xmath1   and @xmath2 multiplets ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "11 in lpez ariste & casini 2002 ) are often in contradiction with the commonly used hypothesis of _ optically thin _ multiplets ( see e.g. , bommier 1977 ) .",
    "besides , up to now the most recent radiative models ( labrosse & gouttebroze 2001 , 2004 ) still assume mono - dimensional ( 1d ) static slabs and _ no _ atomic fine structure for the hei model - atom , which lead to the synthesis of unrealistic gaussian profiles . given the high spectral resolution of actual observations , it is therefore important to use the best numerical radiative modelling tools in 2d geometry , as a first step , and a more detailed hei atomic model in order to improve our spectral diagnosis capability .    as a first application of the new 2d radiative transfer code developed by us ( paletou & lger 2007 , lger et al .",
    "2007 ) , we have shown how _ multi - thread _ models , for which one considers the emission resulting from a bunch of cool small - scale structures distributed along the line of sight , could explain the measured intensity ratios ( lger & paletou 2008 ) .",
    "such a forward complex radiative modelling now have to be exploited and developed further .",
    "it should also be used for the generation of synthetic polarization signals , possibly combined with recently developed numerical tools such as hazel ( asensio ramos et al .",
    "the spectropolarimetry of solar prominences have been renewed during the last decade with the advent of both new telescopes , new spectropolarimeters and detectors .",
    "even though the data collection has not been huge so far , most of the measurements of quality have led to new and surprising results .    in that field ,",
    "the solar telescope thmis with its unique multi - line spectropolarimetric capability is definitely , at the present time , the instrument of choice for such studies . in a near - future",
    ", only the dedicated promag spectropolarimeter currently developed at hao / ncar , and to be deployed at the evans solar facility ( nso / sp , usa ) , will provide almost comparable sets of data .",
    "it is finally expected that the future 4-m aperture solar telescope est will allow too , at the 2020 horizon , for the collection of the most suitable combination of spectropolarimetric data necessary for ever more precise determinations of the magnetic fields of solar prominences .",
    "arturo lpez ariste ( thmis , cnrs ) , roberto casini ( hao , ncar , boulder ) , reza rezai ( kis , freiburg ) and ludovick lger ( latt , u. toulouse , cnrs ) are the main collaborators of our observing programme related to the spectropolarimetry of solar prominences .",
