    "the family of superstable orbits - often called supercycles - of unimodal maps have played a prominent role in the historical uncovering of the cascade of period - doubling bifurcations that leads to the transition to chaos with the celebrated universal features displayed by the feigenbaum attractor @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these periodic attractors are easy to find because one of its cycle positions corresponds to the maximum of the map .",
    "and then , they are convenient for basic computational purposes because trajectories originating at different positions settle very fast into the attractor for the reason that their lyapunov exponent diverges to minus infinity .",
    "and so they offered a suitable path for the initial characterization of the period - doubling route to chaos .",
    "oddly enough , several features associated to the dynamical evolution toward these attractors have remained unexplored . here",
    "we provide an account of these properties , some shared by other families of periodic attractors and some specific of the supercycles .",
    "we discuss explicitly the case of a map with quadratic maximum but the results are easily extended to general nonlinearity @xmath1 . in closing",
    "we indicate the broader theoretical interest in these properties .    in order to obtain dynamical properties with previously unstated detail we determined the organization of the _ entire _ set of trajectories as generated by all possible initial conditions .",
    "we find that the paths taken by the full set of trajectories in their way to the supercycle attractors ( or to their complementary repellors ) are far from unstructured .",
    "the preimages of the attractor of period @xmath2 , @xmath3 are distributed into different basins of attraction , one for each of the @xmath2  phases ( positions ) that compose the  cycle .",
    "when @xmath4 these basins are separated by fractal boundaries whose complexity increases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the boundaries consist of the preimages of the corresponding repellor and their positions cluster around the @xmath6 repellor positions according to an exponential law .",
    "as @xmath7 increases the structure of the basin boundaries becomes more involved .",
    "namely , the boundaries for the @xmath2 cycle develops new features around those of the previous @xmath8 cycle boundaries , with the outcome that a hierarchical structure arises , leading to embedded clusters of clusters of boundary positions , and so forth .",
    "the dynamics associated to families of trajectories always displays a distinctively concerted order that reflects the repellor preimage boundary structure of the basins of attraction .",
    "that is , each trajectory has an initial condition that is identified as an attractor ( or repellor ) preimage of a given order , and this trajectory necessarily follows the steps of other trajectories with initial conditions of lower preimage order belonging to a given chain or pathway to the attractor ( or repellor ) .",
    "this feature gives rise to transient chaotic behavior different from that observed at the last stage of approach to the attractor .",
    "when the period @xmath2 of the cycle increases the dynamics becomes more involved with increasingly more complex stages that reflect the preimage hierarchical structure .",
    "as a final point , at the closing part of the last leg of the trajectories an ultra - rapid convergence to the attractor is observed , with a sensitivity to initial conditions that decreases as an exponential of an exponential of time . in relation to this",
    "we find that there is a functional composition renormalization group ( rg ) fixed - point map associated to the supercycle attractor , and this can be expressed in closed form by the same kind of @xmath0 -exponential function found for both the pitchfork and tangent bifurcation attractors @xcite , @xcite , like that originally derived by hu and rudnick for the latter case @xcite .    before proceeding to give details in the following sections of the aforementioned dynamics we recall basic features of the bifurcation forks that form the period - doubling cascade sequence in unimodal maps , epitomized by the logistic map @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the superstable periodic orbits of lengths @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are located along the bifurcation forks , i.e. the control parameter value @xmath12 for the superstable @xmath2-attractor is that for which the orbit of period @xmath2 contains the point @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the value of @xmath15 at the period - doubling accumulation point . the positions ( or phases ) of the @xmath2-attractor are given by @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "notice that infinitely many other sequences of superstable attractors appear at the period - doubling cascades within the windows of periodic attractors for values of @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "associated to the @xmath2-attractor at @xmath20 there is a @xmath21-repellor consisting of @xmath22 positions @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "these positions are the unstable solutions , @xmath25 , of @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the first , @xmath28 , originates at the initial period - doubling bifurcation , the next two , @xmath29 , start at the second bifurcation , and so on , with the last group of @xmath8 , @xmath30 , stemming from the @xmath31 bifurcation .",
    "we find it useful to order the repellor positions , or simply , repellors , present at @xmath32 , according to a hierarchy or tree , the ` oldest ' with @xmath28 up to the most recent ones with @xmath33 .",
    "the repellors order is given by the value of @xmath34 .",

    "nevertheless it is clear that the main characteristic in the dynamics is the development of a hierarchical organization of the preimage structure as the period @xmath2 of the supercycles increases .",
    "with the knowledge gained about the features displayed by the times of flight @xmath47 for the first few supercycles it is possible to determine and understand how the leading properties in the dynamics of approach to these attractors arise .",
    "the information contained in @xmath133 can be used to demonstrate in detail how the concepts of final state sensitivity @xcite - due to attractor multiplicity - and transient chaos @xcite - prevalent in the presence of repellors that coexist with periodic attractors - realize in a given dynamics .",
    "final state sensitivity is the consequence of fractal boundaries separating coexisting attractors . in our case",
    "there is always a single attractor but its positions or phases play an equivalent role @xcite .",
    "transient chaos beck1 is due to fast separation in time of nearby trajectories by the action of a repellor and results in a sensitivity to initial conditions that grows exponentially up to a crossover time after which the decay sets in .",
    "we describe below how both properties result from an extremely ordered flow of trajectories towards the attractor .",
    "this order is imprinted by the preimage structure described in the previous section .",
    "for the simplest supercycle at @xmath134 there is trivial final state sensitivity as the boundary between the two basins of the phases , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , consists only of the two positions , @xmath135 and @xmath96 see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . consider the length @xmath136 of a small interval around a given value of @xmath48 containing either @xmath120 or @xmath137 , when @xmath138 any uncertainty as to the final phase of the trajectory disappears .",
    "it is also simple to verify that when @xmath48 is close to @xmath120 or @xmath137 the resulting trajectories increase their separation at initial and intermediate times displaying transient chaos in a straightforward fashion . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the same type of transitory exponential sensitivity to initial conditions for a trajectory at @xmath116 after it reaches a repellor position in the final journey towards the period @xmath114 attractor .",
    "this behavior is common to all periodic attractors when trajectories come near a repellor at the final leg of their journey .    for @xmath139 ( equivalent to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "different types of lines are used for different sub - basins of attraction that form the fractal boundary between the attractor positions .",
    "the black solid line corresponds to the attractor position @xmath76 , the grey solid line to @xmath140 , dashed grey line to @xmath84 , and dashed black line to @xmath141 .",
    "the sub - basins are separated in an alternated fashion by repulsor preimages ( peaks ) and there are just two types of sub - basins depending on @xmath142  being larger or smaller than @xmath77 . ]    for @xmath88 there are more remarkable properties arising from the more complex preimage structure . there is a concerted migration of initial conditions seeping through the boundaries between the four basins of attraction of the phases .",
    "these boundaries , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , form a fractal network of interlaced sub - basins separated from each other by two preimages of different repellor phases and have at their bottom a preimage of an attractor phase .",
    "trajectories on one of these sub - basins move to the nearest sub - basin of its type ( next - nearest neighbor in actual distance in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) at each iteration of the map @xmath143 ( @xmath85 time steps for the original map @xmath144 ) .",
    "the movement is always away from the center of the cluster at the old repellor position @xmath120 or at its preimage @xmath137 ( located at the steepest slope inflection points of @xmath143 shown in fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "once a trajectory is out of the cluster ( contained between the maxima and minima of @xmath145 next to the mentioned inflection points ) it proceeds to the basin of attraction of an attractor phase ( separated from the cluster by the inflection points with gentler slope of @xmath143 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) where its final stage takes place .",
    "when considering a large ensemble of initial positions , distributed uniformly along all phase space , the common journey towards the attractor displays an exceedingly ordered pattern .",
    "each initial position @xmath48 within either of the two clusters of sub - basins is a preimage of a given order @xmath36 of a position in the main basin of attraction .",
    "each iteration of @xmath143 reduces the order of the preimage from @xmath36 to @xmath146 , and the new position @xmath147 replaces the initial position @xmath148 ( a preimage of order @xmath146 ) of another trajectory that under the same time step has migrated to the initial position @xmath149 ( a preimage of order @xmath150 ) of another trajectory , and so on .    , @xmath81  and @xmath151 .",

    "positions of the trajectory correspond to the black solid dots , and iterations correspond to the number associated to each dot . ]",
    "it is clear that the dynamics at @xmath88 displays sensitivity to the final state when the initial condition @xmath48 is located near the core of any of the two clusters of sub - basins at @xmath120 and @xmath152 that form the boundary of the attractor phases .",
    "any uncertainty on the location of @xmath48 when arbitrarily close to these positions implies uncertainty about the final phase of a trajectory .",
    "there is also transient chaotic behavior associated to the migration of trajectories out of the cluster as a result of the organized preimage resettlement mentioned above .",
    "indeed , the exponential disposition of repellor preimages shown in fig . [ fig5 ] is actually a realization of two trajectories with initial conditions in consecutive peaks of the cluster structure .",
    "therefore , the exponential expression given in the previous section in relation to fig . [ fig5 ] can be rewritten as the expression for a trajectory , @xmath153 , with , @xmath154 , @xmath155 @xmath156 , and @xmath157 , where @xmath158 .",
    "straightforward differentiation of @xmath159 with respect to @xmath48 yields an exponential sensitivity to initial conditions with positive effective lyapunov coefficient @xmath160 .",
    "as it can be anticipated , the dynamics of approach to the next supercycle at @xmath116 can be explained by enlarging the description presented above for @xmath88 with the additional features of its preimage structure already detailed in the previous section . as in the previous case",
    ", trajectories with initial conditions @xmath48 located inside a cluster of sub - basins of the attractor phases will proceed to move out of it in the systematic manner described for the only two isolated clusters present when @xmath88 .",

    "[ fig6 ] to [ fig8 ] .",
    "once such trajectories leave the cluster under consideration they enter into a neighboring cluster , and so forth , so that the trajectories advance out of these fractal boundaries through the prolonged process of migration out of the cluster of clusters before they proceed to the basins of the attraction of the eight phases of this cycle . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we show one such trajectory in consecutive times @xmath161 for the original map and also in multiples of time @xmath162 the logarithmic scale of the figure makes evident the retardation of each stage in the process .",
    "as when @xmath163 , it is clear that in the approach to the @xmath116 attractor there is sensitivity to the final state and transitory chaotic sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "again , the exponential expression , given in the previous section associated to the preimage structure of clusters of clusters of sub - basins shown in fig . [ fig7 ] , can be interpreted as the expression of a trajectory of the form @xmath164 .",

    "the role played by a cluster of sub - basins when @xmath163 is preserved for the clusters present when @xmath116 but the additional presence of clusters of clusters of sub - basins introduces a similar role in the dynamics at a broader scale in the preimage structure .",

    "<S> we uncover previously unknown properties of the family of periodic superstable cycles in unimodal maps characterized each by a lyapunov exponent that diverges to minus infinity . amongst the main novel properties </S>",
    "<S> are the following : i ) the basins of attraction for the phases of the cycles develop fractal boundaries of increasing complexity as the period - doubling structure advances towards the transition to chaos . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) the fractal boundaries , formed by the preimages of the repellor , display hierarchical structures organized according to exponential clusterings that manifest in the dynamics as sensitivity to the final state and transient chaos . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) there is a functional composition renormalization group ( rg ) fixed - point map associated to the family of supercycles . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) this map is given in closed form by the same kind of @xmath0-exponential function found for both the pitchfork and tangent bifurcation attractors . </S>",
    "<S> v ) there is a final stage ultra - fast dynamics towards the attractor with a sensitivity to initial conditions that decreases as an exponential of an exponential of time .    </S>",
