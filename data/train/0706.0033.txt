    "the matter content of the largest clusters of galaxies is expected to provide an almost fair sample of the matter content of the universe ( white 1993 ; eke 1998 , frenk 1999 ) .",
    "the ratio of baryonic - to - total mass in clusters should , therefore , closely match the ratio of the cosmological parameters @xmath21 .",
    "the baryonic mass content of clusters is dominated by the x - ray emitting gas , the mass of which exceeds the mass of optically luminous material by a factor @xmath22 , with other sources of baryonic matter being negligible ( fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ; lin & mohr 2004 ) . the combination of robust measurements of the baryonic mass fraction in clusters from x - ray observations together with a determination of @xmath23 from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data or big - bang nucleosynthesis calculations and a constraint on the hubble constant , can therefore be used to measure @xmath24 ( white & frenk 1991 ; fabian 1991 ; briel , henry & bhringer 1992 ; white 1993 , david , jones & forman 1995 ; white & fabian 1995 ; evrard 1997 ; mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ; roussel , sadat & blanchard 2000 ; grego 2001 ; allen , schmidt & fabian 2002a ; allen 2003 , 2004 ; ettori , tozzi & rosati 2003 ; sanderson & ponman 2003 ; lin , mohr & stanford 2003 ; laroque 2006 ) .",
    "this method currently provides one of our best constraints on @xmath24 and is remarkably simple and robust in terms of its underlying assumptions .",
    "measurements of the apparent evolution of the cluster x - ray gas mass fraction , hereafter , can also be used to probe the acceleration of the universe ( allen 2004 ; see also sasaki 1996 , pen 1997 , allen 2002a , 2003 , ettori 2003 , laroque 2006 ) .",
    "this constraint originates from the dependence of the measurements , which derive from the observed x - ray gas temperature and density profiles , on the assumed distances to the clusters , @xmath25 .",
    "dependence , consider a spherical region of observed angular radius @xmath26 within which the mean gas mass fraction is measured .",

    "the x - ray luminosity emitted from within this region , @xmath29 , is related to the detected flux , @xmath30 , as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the luminosity distance and @xmath33 is the angular diameter distance .",
    "since the x - ray emission is primarily due to collisional processes ( bremsstrahlung and line emission ) and is optically thin , we may also write @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mean number density of colliding gas particles and @xmath36 is the volume of the emitting region , with @xmath37 . considering the cosmological distance dependences",

    "thus , the x - ray gas mass fraction measured within angle @xmath26 is @xmath42 . ]",
    "the expectation from non - radiative hydrodynamical simulations is that for the largest ( @xmath43kev ) , dynamically relaxed clusters and for measurement radii beyond the innermost core ( @xmath44 ) , should be approximately constant with redshift ( eke 1998 ; crain 2007 ) .",
    "however , possible systematic variation of with redshift can be accounted for in a straightforward manner , so long as the allowed range of such variation is constrained by numerical simulations or other , complementary data ( eke 1998 ; bialek , evrard & mohr 2001 ; muanwong 2002 ; borgani 2004 ; kay s. 2004 ; ettori 2004 , 2006 ; kravtsov , nagai & vikhlinin 2005 ; nagai , vikhlinin & kravtsov 2007a ) .",
    "the first clear detection of cosmic acceleration using the   technique was made by allen ( 2004 ) using chandra observations of 26 hot ( @xmath45kev ) , x - ray luminous ( @xmath46 ) , dynamically relaxed clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath47 . the total chandra exposure used in that work , after all screening procedures were applied ,",

    "we present a significant extension of the allen ( 2004 ) work .",
    "our expanded sample contains 42 clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath51 .",
    "we incorporate new , deeper exposures for some of the original clusters , as well as new targets , approximately doubling the total exposure time used .",
    "our analysis method incorporates conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties associated with instrument calibration , cluster physics and data modelling . as before ,",
    "we employ rigorous selection criteria , restricting the analysis to the hottest , most dynamically relaxed clusters .",
    "we show that this leads to remarkably small intrinsic scatter in the  measurements , with no apparent systematic dependence of  on temperature for clusters with @xmath3kev .",
    "our method imposes a minimum of prior constraints and does not require that the density and temperature profiles of the x - ray emitting gas follow simple parameterized forms .",
    "we make our  measurements for each cluster at the radius @xmath52 in the reference @xmath11cdm cosmology , corresponding to an angle @xmath53 , for which the mean enclosed mass density is 2500 times the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "this corresponds to about one quarter of the virial radius , with respect to the critical density ( lahav 1991 ; eke 1998 ) . ] and represents a near - optimal choice for chandra studies , being sufficiently large to provide small systematic scatter but not so large as to be hampered by systematic uncertainties in the background modelling .",
    "we compare our  measurements to results from other , independent studies and to the predictions from current hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "our analysis of cosmological parameters employs a markov chain monte carlo approach , which is efficient and allows for the simple inclusion of priors and a comprehensive study of the effects of systematic uncertainties .",
    "we present results based on studies of the  data alone ( adopting simple priors on @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) and for the  data used in combination with current cmb constraints ( in which case the priors on @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be dropped ) and snia data ( astier 2006 ; riess 2007 ; wood - vasey 2007 ; jha , riess & kirshner 2007 ) .",
    "we highlight the power of the data combinations for cosmological work , particularly in constraining the mean matter and dark energy densities of the universe and the dark energy equation of state .",
    "the  measurements are quoted for a flat @xmath11cdm reference cosmology with @xmath56=0.7 and @xmath57 .",
    "0 truein    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      hydrodynamical simulations suggest that the intrinsic dispersion in  measurements for the largest , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters should be small .",
    "nagai ( 2007a ) simulate and analyze mock x - ray observations of galaxy clusters ( including cooling and feedback processes ) , employing standard assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium and identifying relaxed systems based on x - ray morphology in a similar manner to that employed here .",
    "for relaxed clusters , these authors find that  measurements at @xmath52 are biased low by @xmath58 per cent , with the bias primarily due to non - thermal pressure support provided by subsonic bulk motions in the intracluster gas .",
    "they measure an intrinsic dispersion in the  measurements of @xmath22 per cent , with an indication that the scatter may be even smaller for analyses limited to the hottest , relaxed systems with @xmath45kev .",
    "nagai ( 2007a ) also suggest that the true bias and scatter may be yet smaller if their simulations have underestimated the viscosity of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "filaments suggest a relatively high gas viscosity ( low reynolds number ) in nearby cluster cores ( fabian 2003a , b,2005 , ruszkowski , brggen & begelman 2004 , reynolds 2005 ) . ] in contrast , for @xmath59 simulated clusters , nagai ( 2007a ) find that   measurements are biased low by on average 27 per cent with an intrinsic dispersion of more than 50 per cent .",
    "thus , the dispersion in  measurements for unrelaxed clusters is expected to be an order of magnitude larger than for relaxed systems .",
    "this is in agreement with the measurement of very low intrinsic systematic scatter in the  data for relaxed clusters reported here ( see below ) and the much larger scatter measured in previous works that included no such restriction to relaxed clusters .",
    "earlier , non - radiative simulations by eke ( 1998 ) also argued for a small intrinsic scatter in , at the few per cent level , for large , relaxed clusters ( see also crain 2007 ) .",
    "likewise , kay ( 2004 ) measure a small intrinsic dispersion in  measurements from simulations including cooling and moderate star formation .    the expectation of a small intrinsic dispersion in the  measurements for hot , dynamically relaxed clusters is strikingly confirmed by the present data . even without including the allowances for systematic uncertainties associated with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 described in table  [ table : sys ] ( keeping only the 10 per cent systematic uncertainty on the overall normalization , as described by @xmath65 ) the best - fitting non - flat @xmath66 model gives an acceptable @xmath67 for 40 degrees of freedom , when fitting the full  sample .",
    "( the @xmath68 drops only to 41.5 with the full set of systematic allowances included ; this small change in @xmath68 illustrates the degeneracies between the systematic allowances and model parameters . ) the acceptable @xmath68 for the best - fitting model rules out the presence of significant intrinsic , systematic scatter in the current  data .",
    "this absence of systematic scatter is observed despite the fact that the root - mean - square scatter in the  data is only 15 per cent .",
    "moreover , the rms scatter is dominated by those measurements with large statistical uncertainties ; the weighted mean scatter of the  data about the best - fit @xmath11cdm model is only 7.2 per cent , which corresponds to only @xmath69 per cent in distance .",
    "we have next examined the ability of our data to constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath2 . in the first case",
    ", we examined a geometrically flat model in which @xmath2 is constant with time .",
    "[ fig : w_const ] shows the constraints in the @xmath0 , @xmath2 plane for this model using the chandra  data and standard priors / allowances ( red contours ) , the cmb data ( blue contours ) and snia data ( green contours ) .",
    "the different parameter degeneracies in the data sets are clearly evident .",
    "for the  data alone , we measure @xmath6 and @xmath70 .",
    "the results for the three data sets shown in fig .  [ fig : w_const ] are each , individually , consistent with the @xmath11cdm model ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the consistent nature of these constraints again motivates a combined analysis of the data , shown as the small , central ( orange ) contours .",
    "for the three data sets combined , we measure @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( 68 per cent confidence limits ) .",
    "no priors on @xmath8 and @xmath55 are required or used in the combined + cmb+snia analysis .",
    "the constraints on @xmath2 from the combined data set are significantly tighter than 10 per cent .",
    "we note that our analysis accounts for the effects of dark energy perturbations , which must exist for dark energy models other than @xmath11cdm ; neglecting the effects of such perturbations can lead to spuriously tight constraints ( see rapetti 2005 for details ) .",
    "[ fig : w_evol ] shows the constraints on @xmath72 and @xmath73 obtained from a combined analysis of + cmb+snia data using the general , evolving dark energy model ( equation  [ eq : evolve ] ) and assuming geometric flatness ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the left and right panels show the results obtained for the two separate snia samples ( section  [ section : otherdata ] ) . using the davis ( 2007 ) snia compilation ( left panel ) , we find no evidence for evolution in the dark energy equation of state over the redshift range spanned by the data : the results on the dark energy equation of state at late and early times , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( 68 per cent confidence limits ) , are both consistent with a cosmological constant model ( @xmath71 , constant ) . a similar conclusion is drawn by davis ( 2007 ) using snia+cmb+baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data .",
    "we note , however , a hint of evolution in the dark energy equation of state when the riess ( 2007 ) ` gold ' snia sample is used instead ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : w_evol ] ) . in this case , the marginalized constraints on dark energy at late and early times , as defined in section  [ section : demod ] , differ at the @xmath77 level .",
    "similar indications are also apparent in the analysis of the same snia ( + cmb+bao ) data by riess ( 2007 ) . however , the analysis using the davis ( 2007 ) snia compilation ( left panel ) , which includes the high - quality , high - redshift hst supernovae from riess ( 2007 ) and which shows no suggestion of a departure from the @xmath11cdm model , argues that the hint of evolution in the right panel of fig .",

    "the improvement in the constraints on these parameters determined from the + cmb data over the cmb data alone is substantial .",
    "the tight constraints for the + cmb data , @xmath81  and @xmath82 , demonstrate clearly why external priors on these two parameters are not required when the  and cmb data are combined .",
    "indeed , the constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath8 obtained from the + cmb data are significantly tighter than the external priors on these parameters that are employed when the  data are used alone ( table  [ table : sys ] ) .",

    "[ fig : w_nonflat ] shows the constraints on the dark energy equation of state obtained from an analysis of the combined + cmb+snia data set where the curvature is also included as a free parameter .",

    "17 ) from a combined analysis of cmb , snia and galaxy redshift survey data .",
    "the constraints for the non - flat evolving @xmath2 model ( right panel ) , though weaker than those for the flat model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : w_evol ] ) , remain interesting and are also consistent with a cosmological constant . as discussed by rapetti ( 2005 ; see also spergel 2007 ) , such results demonstrate the power of the + cmb+snia data to constrain the properties of dark energy without the need to assume that the universe is flat .",
    "using the non - flat evolving @xmath2 model but fixing the transition redshift @xmath85 in equation  [ eq : evolve ] , we recover the model used by the dark energy task force ( detf ) to assess the power of future dark energy experiments .",
    "the combination of current + cmb+snia data provides a detf figure of merit @xmath20 .",
    "the new chandra  results and analysis presented here build upon those of allen ( 2004 ) and rapetti ( 2005 ) .",
    "the present study includes 16 more objects , approximately twice as much chandra data and extends the study beyond a redshift of 1 . our analysis includes a comprehensive and conservative treatment of systematic uncertainties ( section  [ section : modelling ] ; see also table  [ table : sys ] ) .",
    "allowances for such uncertainties are easily incorporated into the mcmc analysis .    as with snia studies ,",
    "the  data constrain dark energy via its effects on the distance - redshift relation to a well - defined source population  in this case , the largest , dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters  using measurements of a ` standard ' astrophysical quantity  the ratio of baryonic - to - total mass in the clusters .",
    "our results provide a clear and independent detection of the effects of dark energy on the expansion of the universe at @xmath86 confidence for a standard non - flat @xmath11cdm model , an accuracy comparable to that obtained from current snia work ( astier 2006 ; riess 2007 ; wood - vasey 2007 ; miknaitis 2007 ) . like snia studies ,",
    "the  data trace the evolution of dark energy over the redshift range @xmath87 , where it grows to dominate the overall energy density of the universe .",
    "our results for the  data alone , and the combination of + cmb+snia data , show that this growth is consistent with that expected for models in which the dark energy is a cosmological constant ( @xmath71 ) .    despite some clear similarities , important complementary differences between",
    "the  and snia experiments exist . in the first case , the physics of the astrophysical objects ",
    "large , relaxed galaxy clusters and snia  are very different ; the fact that such similar cosmological results are obtained from the distance - redshift information for these separate source populations is reassuring .",
    "future studies , combining the two techniques but using larger target samples , should open the possibility for precise distance - redshift measurements and good control of systematic uncertainties , employing both kinematic and dynamical analyses ( rapetti 2007 ; riess 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "an important strength of the  method is the tight constraint on @xmath0 provided by the normalization of the  curve ; this breaks the degeneracy between the mean matter density and dark energy density inherent in the distance measurements .",
    "our result on @xmath0 is consistent with a host of previous x - ray studies ( section 1 ) .",
    "a further strength , which is of relevance when considering observing strategies for future dark energy work , is the small intrinsic dispersion in the  distance measurements .",
    "snia studies have established the presence of a systematic scatter of @xmath88 per cent in distance measurements for individual snia using high quality data ( jha 2007 ; see also riess 2004 , 2007 ; astier 2006 ; wood - vasey 2007 ) .",
    "in contrast , systematic scatter remains undetected in the present chandra  data for hot , relaxed clusters , despite the fact that the weighted mean @xmath89 scatter in @xmath90 data corresponds to only @xmath91 per cent in distance .",
    "this small systematic scatter for large , dynamically relaxed clusters ( identified as relaxed on the basis of their x - ray morphologies ) is consistent with the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations ( nagai 2007a ) , although the results for both observed and simulated clusters are , at present , based on relatively small samples and more data are required .",
    "we stress that such small systematic scatter is neither expected nor observed in studies where a restriction to morphologically relaxed clusters is @xmath92 employed compare the small scatter measured here with the much larger scatter observed in the studies of laroque ( 2006 ) and ettori ( 2003 ) ; see also nagai ( 2007a ) .",
    "the restriction to the hottest , relaxed clusters , for which  is independent of temperature ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fgaskt ] ) , also simplifies the determination of cosmological parameters .    as mentioned above , the allowances for systematic uncertainties included in the analysis are relatively conservative .",
    "much progress is expected over the coming years in refining the ranges of these allowances , both observationally and through improved simulations .",
    "as discussed in sections 5.1 and 5.2 , a reduction in the size of the required systematic allowances will tighten the cosmological constraints . improved numerical simulations of large samples of massive clusters , including",
    "a more complete treatment of star formation and feedback physics that reproduces both the observed optical galaxy luminosity function and cluster x - ray properties , will be of major importance .",
    "progress in this area has been made ( bialek , evrard & mohr 2001 , muanwong 2002 , kay s. , 2004 , kravtsov , nagai & vikhlinin 2005 , ettori 2004 , 2006 , rasia 2006 ; nagai 2007a , b ) , though more work remains .",
    "in particular , this work should improve the predictions for @xmath93 .",
    "further deep x - ray and optical observations of nearby clusters will provide better constraints on the viscosity of the cluster gas .",
    "improved optical / near infrared observations of clusters should pin down the stellar mass fraction in galaxy clusters and its evolution .",
    "ground and space - based gravitational lensing studies will provide important , independent constraints on the mass distributions in clusters ; a large program using the subaru telescope and hubble space telescope is underway , as is similar work by other groups ( hoekstra 2007 ) .",
    "follow - up observations of the sz effect will also provide additional , independent constraining power in the measurement of cosmological parameters ( the combination of direct observations of the sz effect using radio / sub - mm data and the prediction of this effect from x - ray data provides an additional constraint on absolute distances to the clusters molnar 2002 , schmidt , allen & fabian 2004 ; bonamente 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the independent constraints provided by the sz observations should allow a reduction of the priors required in future work ( rapetti & allen 2007 ) .    in the near future , continuing programs of chandra and xmm - newton observations of known",
    ", x - ray luminous clusters should allow important progress to be made , both by expanding the  sample ( chandra snapshot observations of the entire macs sample ; ebeling 2001 , 2007 ) and through deeper observations of the current target list .",
    "the advent of new , large area sz surveys ( ruhl 2004 ) will soon provide important new target lists of hot , x - ray luminous high redshift clusters .",
    "a new , large area x - ray survey such as that proposed by the spectrum - rg / erosita project could make a substantial contribution , finding hundreds of suitable systems at high redshifts .    looking a decade ahead , the constellation - x observatory ( con - x ) and , later , xeus offer the possibility to carry out precise studies of dark energy using the  technique . as discussed by rapetti & allen ( 2007 ; see also rapetti 2006 ) , the large collecting area and combined spatial / spectral resolving power of con - x should permit precise  measurements with @xmath12 per cent accuracy for large samples ( @xmath94 ) of hot , massive clusters ( @xmath45kev ) spanning the redshift range @xmath95 ( typical redshift @xmath96 ) . the predicted constraints on dark energy from such an experiment , assuming planck priors ( albrecht 2006 ) , have a detf figure of merit @xmath97 , which is comparable to other leading proposed dark energy techniques such as snia , cluster number counts , weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillation studies .",
    "the high spectral resolution offered by the con - x calorimeters will also permit precise measurements of bulk motions and viscosity in the cluster gas , addressing directly one of the main sources of systematic uncertainty in the method .",

    "<S> the detection of dark energy is comparable in significance to recent type ia supernovae ( snia ) studies and represents strong , independent evidence for cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> systematic scatter remains undetected in the  data , despite a weighted mean statistical scatter in the distance measurements of only @xmath12 per cent . for a flat cosmology with a constant dark energy equation of state </S>",

    "<S> removes the need for priors on @xmath8 and @xmath7 and leads to tighter constraints : @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the same constant@xmath16 model . </S>",
    "<S> our most general analysis allows the equation of state to evolve with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> marginalizing over possible transition redshifts @xmath17 , the combined + cmb+snia data set constrains the dark energy equation of state at late and early times to be @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , in agreement with the cosmological constant paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> relaxing the assumption of flatness weakens the constraints on the equation of state by only a factor @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis includes conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties associated with instrument calibration , cluster physics , and data modelling . the measured small systematic scatter , tight constraint on @xmath0 and powerful constraints on dark energy from the  data bode well for future dark energy studies using the next generation of powerful x - ray observatories , such as constellation - x .    </S>",
