    "-5 mm    recent years have seen an explosion of activity at the interface of graph theory and statistical physics , with probabilistic combinatorics and the theory of computing as major catalysts .",
    "the concept of `` phase transition '' , which a short time ago most graph theorists would barely recognize , has now appeared and reappeared in journals as far from physics as the _ journal of combinatorial theory _ ( series b ) .",
    "traffic between graph theory and statistical physics is already heavy enough to make a complete survey a book - length proposition , even if one were to assume a readership with knowledge of both fields .",
    "this article is intended for a general mathematical audience , _ not _ necessarily acquainted with statistical physics , but it is not to serve as an introduction to the field .",
    "readers are referred to texts such as @xcite for more background .",
    "we will present only a small part ( but we hope an interesting one ) of the interface between combinatorics and statistical physics , with just enough background in each to make sense of the text .",
    "we will focus on the most combinatorial of physical models  those with hard constraints  and inevitably on the authors own research and related work .",
    "we hope it will be clear from our development that there is an enormous amount of fascinating mathematics to be uncovered by studying statistical physics , quite a lot of which has been or will be connected to graph theory .",
    "what follows is only a sample .",
    "-5 mm    in what follows a _",
    "graph _ @xmath3 consists of a set @xmath4 ( finite or countably infinite ) of _ nodes _ together with a set @xmath5 of _ edges _ , each of which is an unordered pair of nodes",
    ". we will sometimes permit loops ( edges of the form @xmath6 ) but multiple edges will not be considered or needed .",
    "we write @xmath7 , and say that @xmath8 is `` adjacent '' to @xmath9 , if @xmath10 ; a set @xmath11 is said to be _ independent _ if it contains no edges .",
    "the _ degree _ of a node @xmath8 of @xmath1 is the number of nodes adjacent to @xmath8 ; all graphs considered here will be _ locally finite _ , meaning that all nodes have finite degree .",
    "a _ path _ in @xmath1 ( of length @xmath12 ) is a sequence @xmath13 of distinct nodes with @xmath14 ; if in addition @xmath15 we have a _ cycle _ of length @xmath16 .",
    "if every two nodes of @xmath1 are connected by a path , @xmath1 is said to be _",
    "connected_.    the plane grid @xmath17 is given a graph structure by putting @xmath18 iff @xmath19 .",
    "let us carve out a big piece of @xmath17 , say the box @xmath20{.1mm}{4 mm } \\;}-n \\le i , j \\le n\\}$ ] .",
    "let @xmath21 be a uniformly random independent set in the graph @xmath22 ; in other words , of all sets of nodes ( including the empty set ) not containing an edge , choose one uniformly at random .",
    "what does it look like ?",
    "plate 1 shows such an @xmath21 ( in a rectangular region ) . here",
    "the nodes are represented by squares , two being adjacent if they have a common vertical or horizontal border segment .",
    "the sites belonging to @xmath21 are colored , the others omitted .",
    "it is by no means obvious how to obtain such a random independent set in practice ; one can not simply choose points one at a time subject to the independence constraint .",
    "in fact the set in plate 1 was generated by _",
    "markov chain mixing _ , an important and fascinating method in the theory of computing , which has by itself motivated much recent work at the physics - combinatorics interface .",
    "it is common in statistical physics to call the nodes of @xmath22 _ sites _ ( and the edges , _ bonds _ ) .",
    "sites in @xmath21 are said to be _ occupied _ ; one may imagine that each occupied site contains a molecule of some gas , any two of which must be at distance greater than 1 .    in the figure ,",
    "_ even _ occupied sites ( nodes @xmath23 for which @xmath24 ) are indicated by one color , odd sites by another . a certain tendency for colors to clump",
    "may be observed ; understandably , since occupied sites of the same parity may be as close as @xmath25 ( in the euclidean norm ) but opposite - parity particles must be at least @xmath26 apart .",
    "it stands to reason that if more `` particles '' were forced into @xmath21 , then we might see more clumping .",
    "let us weight the independent sets according to size , as follows : a positive real @xmath27 , called the _ activity _ ( or sometimes _ fugacity _ ) is fixed , and then each independent set @xmath21 is chosen with probability proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "we call this the `` @xmath27-measure '' . of course if @xmath29 we are back to the uniform measure , but if @xmath30 then larger independent sets are favored .",
    "the @xmath27-measure for @xmath31 is , to a physicist , no less natural than the uniform . in a combinatorial",
    "setting , such a measure might arise e.g.  if the particles happen to be of two different types , with all `` typed '' independent sets equiprobable ; then the probability that a particular set of sites is occupied is given by the @xmath27-measure with @xmath32 .",
    "plate 2 shows a random @xmath21 chosen when @xmath33 .",
    "the clusters have grown hugely as more particles were packed in .",
    "push @xmath27 up just a bit more , to @xmath34 , and something like plate 3 is the result : one color ( parity ) has taken over , leaving only occasional islands of the other .",
    "something qualitative has changed here , but what exactly ?",
    "the random independent sets we have been looking at constitute what the physicists call the _ hard - core lattice gas model _ , or `` hard - core model '' for short .",
    "readers are referred to the exceptionally readable article @xcite in which many nice results are obtained for this model .",
    "on the plane grid , the hard - core model has a `` critical point '' at activity about 3.79 , above which the model is said to have experienced a _ phase transition_.",
    "-5 mm    there is no uniformity even among statistical physicists regarding the definition of phase transition ; in fact , there is even disagreement about whether the `` phases '' above are the even - dominated versus odd - dominated configurations at high @xmath27 , or the high-@xmath27 regime versus the low .",
    "technical definitions involving points of non - analyticity of some function miss the point for us .",
    "the point really is that a slight change in a parameter governing the local behavior of some statistical system , like the hard - core model , can produce a global change in the system , which may be evidenced in many ways .",
    "for example , suppose we sampled many independent sets in @xmath22 at some fixed @xmath27 , and for each computed the ratio of the number of even occupied sites to the number of odd .",
    "for low @xmath27 these numbers would cluster around @xmath35 , but for high @xmath27 they would follow a bimodal distribution ; and the larger the box size @xmath36 , the sharper the transition .",
    "here s another , more general , consideration .",
    "suppose we look only at independent sets which contain all the even sites on the boundary of @xmath22 .",
    "for these @xmath21 the origin would be more likely to be occupied than , say , one of its odd neighbors .",
    "as @xmath36 grows , this `` boundary influence '' will fade  provided @xmath27 is low .",
    "but when @xmath27 is above the critical point , the boundary values tend to make @xmath21 an even - dominated set , giving any even site , no matter how far away from the boundary , a non - disappearing advantage over any odd one .",
    "computationally - minded readers might be interested in a third approach .",
    "suppose we start with a fixed independent set @xmath37 , namely the set of all even sites in @xmath22 , and change it one site at a time as follows : at each tick of a clock we choose a site @xmath8 at random .",
    "if any of @xmath8 s neighbors is occupied , we do nothing .",
    "otherwise we flip a biased coin and with probability @xmath38 we put @xmath8 in @xmath21 ( where it may already have been ) , and with probability @xmath39 we remove it ( or leave it out ) .",
    "the result is a markov chain whose states are independent sets and whose stationary distribution , one can easily verify , is exactly our @xmath27-measure .",
    "thus if we do this for many steps , we will have a nearly perfect sample from this distribution  but how many steps will that take ? we _ believe _ that when @xmath27 is below its critical value , only polynomially ( in @xmath36 ) steps are required  the markov chain is said to be _ rapidly mixing _ ; even polylogarithmic , if we count the number of steps per site .",
    "but for high @xmath27 it appears to take time exponential in @xmath36 ( or perhaps in @xmath40 ) before we can expect to see an odd - dominated independent set .",
    "the exact relationship between phase transition and markov chain mixing is complex and the subject of much study .",
    "all these measures rely on taking limits as the finite box @xmath22 grows ; the very nice discovery of dobrushin , lanford and ruelle @xcite is that there is a way to understand the phenomenon of phase transition as a property of the infinite plane grid .",
    "the idea is to extend the @xmath27-measure to a probability distribution on independent sets on the whole grid , then ask whether the extension is unique .",
    "we can not extend the definition of the @xmath27-measure directly since @xmath28 is generally infinite , but we can ask that it behave locally like the finite measure .",
    "we say that a probability distribution @xmath41 on independent sets in the plane grid is a _",
    "gibbs measure _",
    "if for any site @xmath8 the probability that @xmath8 is in @xmath21 , given the sites in @xmath42 , is @xmath38 if the neighborhood of @xmath8 is unoccupied and , of course , 0 otherwise .",
    "it turns out that gibbs measures always exist ( here , and in far greater generality ) but may or may not be unique .",
    "when there is more than one gibbs measure we will say that there is a phase transition .",
    "for the hard - core model on @xmath17 , there is a unique gibbs measure for low @xmath27 ; but above the critical value , there is a gibbs measure in which the even occupied sites are dominant and another in which the odd sites are dominant ( all other gibbs measures are convex combinations of these two ) .",
    "how can you construct these measures ?",
    "well , for example , the even measure can be obtained as a limit of @xmath27-measures on boxes whose even boundary sites are forced to be in @xmath21 .",
    "the fact that the boundary influence does not fade ( in the high @xmath27 case ) implies that the even and odd gibbs measures are different .",
    "we have noted that the critical value of @xmath27 for the hard - core model on @xmath17 is around 3.79 .",
    "this is an empirical result and all we mathematicians can prove is that there is at least one critical point , and all such are between 1.1 and some high number .",
    "it is believed that , for each @xmath43 , there is just one critical value @xmath44 on @xmath45 .",
    "it is also to be expected that @xmath44 is decreasing in @xmath43 , but only recently has it been shown that the largest critical value on @xmath45 tends to  @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "this result was obtained by david galvin and jeff kahn @xcite , two combinatorialists , using graph theory , geometry , topology , and lots of probabilistic combinatorics .",
    "a consequence of their work is that @xmath29 is above the critical value(s ) for sufficiently large @xmath43 ; this can be stated in a purely combinatorial way : for sufficiently high @xmath43 and large @xmath36 , _ most _ independent sets in @xmath48 are dominated by vertices of one parity .    in the next section",
    "we explain how we can use graphs to understand models with hard constraints ; then , in the section following that , we will switch from @xmath17 to a much easier setting , in which we can get our hands on nice gibbs measures .",
    "-5 mm    we are interested in what are sometimes called `` nearest neighbor '' hard constraint models , where the constraints apply only to adjacent sites .",
    "each site is to be assigned a `` spin '' from some finite set , and only certain pairs of spins are permitted on adjacent sites .",
    "we can code up the constraints as a finite graph @xmath2 whose nodes are the spins , and whose edges correspond to spins allowed to appear at neighboring sites .",
    "this _ constraint graph _",
    "@xmath2 may have some loops ; a loop at node @xmath49 would mean that neighboring sites may both be assigned spin @xmath9 .",
    "we adopt the statistical physics tradition of reserving the letter `` @xmath50 '' for the number of spins , that is , the number of nodes in @xmath2 .",
    "the graph @xmath1 ( e.g.  @xmath17 , above ) of sites , usually infinite but always countable and locally finite , is called ( by us ) the _ board_. a legal assignment of spins to the sites of @xmath1 is nothing more or less than a graph homomorphism from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , i.e.  a map from the sites of @xmath1 to the nodes of @xmath2 which preserves edges .",
    "we denote the set of homomorphisms from @xmath1 to @xmath2 by @xmath0 , and give it a graph structure by putting @xmath51 if @xmath52 and @xmath53 differ at exactly one site of @xmath1 .",
    "we will often confuse a graph with its set of nodes ( or sites ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath54 is a subset of the nodes of @xmath1 then @xmath54 together with the edges of @xmath1 contained in @xmath54 constitute the `` subgraph of @xmath1 induced by @xmath54 '' , which we also denote by @xmath54 .    in the hard - core model ,",
    "the constraint graph @xmath2 consists of two adjacent nodes , one of which is looped : a function from a board @xmath1 to this @xmath2 is a homomorphism iff the set of sites mapped to the unlooped node is an independent set .",
    "plate 4 shows some constraint graphs found in the literature .",
    "when @xmath2 is complete and every node is looped as well , there is no constraint and nothing interesting happens .    when @xmath2 is the complete graph @xmath55 ( without loops ) , homomorphisms to @xmath2 are just ordinary , `` proper '' @xmath50-colorings of the board .",
    "( a proper @xmath50-coloring of a graph @xmath1 is a mapping from the nodes of @xmath1 to a @xmath50-element set in which adjacent nodes are never mapped to the same element . )",
    "this corresponds to something called the `` anti - ferromagnetic potts model at zero temperature '' . in the anti - ferromagnetic potts model at positive temperature ,",
    "adjacent sites are merely discouraged ( by an energy penalty ) , not forbidden , from having the same spin ; thus this is not a hard constraint model in our terminology .",
    "the @xmath56 case of the potts model is the famous ising model .    for a general constraint graph @xmath2",
    ", we need to elevate the notion of activity to vector status .",
    "to each node @xmath57 of @xmath2 we assign a positive real activity @xmath58 , so that @xmath2 now gets an activity vector @xmath59 .",
    "when the board @xmath1 is finite , each homomorphism @xmath60 is assigned probability proportional to @xmath61 we can think of @xmath58 as the degree to which we try to use spin @xmath57 , when it is available . for example , if we know the spins of the neighbors of site @xmath9 and consequently , say , spins @xmath57 , @xmath62 and @xmath12 are allowed for @xmath9 , then the @xmath27-measure forces @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath1 is infinite , things get a little more complicated . a finite subset ( and its induced subgraph )",
    "@xmath64 will be called a `` patch '' and its boundary @xmath65 is the set of sites not in @xmath54 but adjacent to some site of @xmath54 .",
    "we define @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath52 is a function on @xmath1 , then @xmath67 denotes its restriction to the subset @xmath54 .",
    "we say that @xmath41 is a gibbs measure for @xmath27 if : for any patch @xmath64 , and almost every @xmath68 , @xmath69{.1mm}{4 mm } \\;}{{\\varphi}}{\\ ! \\upharpoonright \\!}(g - u ) = \\psi{\\ !",

    ".    this definition looks messy but it just means that the probability distribution of a random @xmath52 inside a patch @xmath54 depends only on its value on the boundary of @xmath54 , and is the same as if @xmath54 and its boundary comprised all of the board .",
    "we will see later that when @xmath2 has a certain nice property , as it does in the case of the hard - core model , it suffices to check the gibbs condition only on patches consisting of a single site ",
    "we call this the one - site condition .",
    "it is a special case of a theorem of dobrushin  @xcite that there is always at least one gibbs measure for any @xmath27 on @xmath0 ; we are concerned with questions about when there is a unique gibbs measure , and when there is a phase transition ( i.e. more than one gibbs measure ) .",
    "let us again look briefly at possible implications for phase transition in the setting of finite boards .",
    "given a finite board @xmath1 , a constraint graph @xmath2 and activities @xmath27 , we define the _ point process _ @xmath72 as follows : starting from any element of @xmath0 , choose a site @xmath8 of @xmath1 uniformly at random , and give it a fresh spin according to the gibbs condition , so that each ` legal ' spin @xmath62 is chosen with probability proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "the point process is a markov chain on @xmath0 , and it is easy to check that the @xmath27-measure is a stationary distribution ( which will be unique provided @xmath0 is connected , a point we will return to later ) .",
    "running the point process for sufficiently long will thus generate a random homomorphism according to the @xmath27-measure .",
    "however , suppose that the finite board @xmath1 is a large piece of an infinite board @xmath74 exhibiting a phase transition for our @xmath27 .",
    "then , if we start with a homomorphism arising from one gibbs measure on @xmath75 ( restricted to @xmath1 ) , it is reasonable to expect that the point process will take a long time to reach a configuration resembling that from any other gibbs measure on @xmath75 .",
    "thus it is generally believed that , in some necessarily loose sense , phase transition on an infinite graph corresponds to slow convergence for the point process on finite subgraphs .",
    "-5 mm    gibbs measures can be elusive and indeed it is generally a difficult task to prove that phase transitions occur on a typical board of interest , like @xmath45 . in order to get results and intuition physicists sometimes turn to a more tractable board , called by them the bethe lattice ( after hans bethe ) and by combinatorialists , usually , the cayley tree .",
    "we denote by @xmath76 the @xmath77-branching cayley tree , equivalently the unique connected ( infinite ) graph which is cycle - free and in which every site has degree @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath76 is a vastly different animal from @xmath45 .",
    "it is barely connected , falling apart with the removal of any site ; its patches have huge boundaries , comparable in size with the patch itself ; its automorphism group is enormous .",
    "it s surprising that we can learn anything at all about @xmath79 from @xmath80 , and indeed we must be careful about drawing even tentative conclusions in either direction .",
    "basic physical parameters like entropy become dodgy on non - amenable ( big - boundary ) boards like @xmath76 and a number of familiar statistical physics techniques become useless .",
    "more than making up for these losses , though , are the combinatorial techniques we can use to study @xmath80 .",
    "there are even situations ( e.g.  in the study of information dissemination ) where @xmath76 is the natural setting .",
    "we are particularly interested in gibbs measures on @xmath80 which have the additional properties of being _ simple _ and _",
    "invariant_.    for any site @xmath8 in a tree @xmath81 , let @xmath82 be the number of edges incident with @xmath8 and let @xmath83 be the connected components of @xmath84 .",
    "[ def : simple ] _ a gibbs measure @xmath41 on @xmath85 is _ simple _ if , for any site @xmath86 and any node @xmath87 , the @xmath41-distributions of @xmath88 are mutually independent given @xmath89 .",
    "_    this condition , which is trivially satisfied by the @xmath27-measure for finite @xmath81 , would follow from the gibbs condition itself if fewer than two of the @xmath90 s were infinite .",

    "later we consider relaxing it slightly . for now , we might well ask , how can we get our hands on any gibbs measure for @xmath80 , let alone a simple , invariant one ?    the absence of cycles in @xmath76 makes it plausible that we can get ourselves a gibbs measure by building random configurations in @xmath80 one site at a time .",
    "we could choose a root @xmath97 , assign it a random spin @xmath87 , then assign the neighbors of @xmath57 randomly to the @xmath78 children of @xmath98 ; thereafter , each time a site @xmath8 gets spin @xmath62 we give its @xmath77 children random spins from among the neighbors of @xmath62",

    "of course , the ( usually tiny ) constraint graph @xmath2 is shortly piled high with exponentially many amoebas , but being transparent they happily ignore one another and go on stepping and dividing .    to get started we have to throw the first amoeba onto @xmath2 where we imagine that its impact will cause it to divide @xmath78 ways instead of the usual @xmath77 .    note",
    "that the @xmath99 case is just ordinary random walk , started somewhere on the doubly - infinite path @xmath100 and run both forward and backward .    to determine what probabilities are used in stepping from one node of @xmath2 to an adjacent node , we assign a positive real _ weight",

    "we use the stationary distribution to pick the starting point for the first amoeba , i.e.  to assign a spin to the root of @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the payoff : not only does this node - weighted branching random walk give us a simple invariant gibbs measure ; it s the _ only _ way to get one .",
    "the following theorem appears in @xcite but it is not fundamentally different from characterizations which can be found in georgii @xcite and elsewhere .",

    "furthermore , in any dimension , there s always _ some _ region where the map @xmath153 is one - to - one :    for any @xmath77 and @xmath2 there is an activity vector @xmath27 for which there is only one simple invariant gibbs measure on @xmath80 .",
    "-5 mm    the fascination begins when we hit an @xmath2 and a @xmath27 which boast multiple simple , invariant gibbs measures .",
    "let us examine a particular case , involving a constraint graph we call the `` hinge '' .",
    "the hinge has three nodes , which we associate with the colors green , yellow and red ; all three nodes are looped and edges connect green with yellow , and yellow with red . thus the only missing edge is green - red , and a @xmath156 may be thought of as a green - yellow - red coloring of the tree in which no green site is adjacent to a red one .",
    "the hinge constraint in fact corresponds to a discrete version of the widom - rowlinson model , in which two gases ( whose particles are represented by red and green ) compete for space and are not permitted to occupy adjacent sites ; see e.g.@xcite .",
    "when @xmath157 and @xmath158 are equal and large relative to @xmath159 , the widom - rowlinson model tends to undergo a phase transition as one gas spontaneously dominates the other .",
    "plate 5 shows a red - dominated sample from the widom - rowlinson model on @xmath17 , with the unoccupied sites left uncolored instead of being colored yellow .",
    "we can see the phase transition operate on the cayley tree @xmath160 .",
    "if the green , yellow and red nodes are weighted 4 , 2 and 1 respectively , @xmath27 ( normalized to integers ) turns out to be @xmath161equal activity for green and red .",
    "how can a random walk which is biased so strongly toward green end up coloring a tree according to a gibbs measure with symmetric specification ? as a clue , let us examine a site @xmath8 of @xmath160 which happens to be surrounded by yellow neighbors",
    ". to be colored green requires that a certain amoeba stepped from yellow to green , then both of its children returned to yellow .",
    "thus the conditional probability that @xmath8 is green is proportional to @xmath162 as opposed to @xmath163 for red , but these values are equal .",
    "clearly the reversed weights 1 , 2 and 4 would yield the same activity vector , and in fact a third , symmetric weighting , approximately 6 , 7 and 6 , does as well .",
    "plate 6 shows pieces of @xmath160 colored according to these three weightings .",
    "of course the colorings have different proportions and are easily identifiable ; checking the stationary distributions for the three random walks , we see that _ a priori _ a site is colored green with probability about 59% in the first weighting , 30% with the symmetric weighting and only 7% in the reversed weighting . yet , from a conditional point of view , the three colorings are identical .",
    "it turns out that the hinge is one of seven minimal graphs each of which can produce a phase transition on @xmath76 for any @xmath154 .",
    "the graphs are pictured in plate 7 .",
    "we say that a graph @xmath2 is _ fertile _ if @xmath80 has more than one simple , invariant gibbs measure for some @xmath77 and @xmath27 ; otherwise it is _",
    "sterile_. the fertile graphs are exactly those which contain one or more of the seven baby graphs in plate 7 as an induced subgraph .",
    "it turns out that the value of @xmath77 does not come into play : if the constraint graph is rich enough to produce a phase transition on any @xmath76 , then it does so for all @xmath164 .",
    "one way to state the result is as follows :    [ main]@xcite fix @xmath165 and let @xmath2 be any constraint graph .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 satisfies the following two conditions :    \\(a ) every looped node of @xmath2 is adjacent to all other nodes of @xmath2 ;    \\(b ) with its loops deleted , @xmath2 is a complete multipartite graph .",
    "then for every activity vector on @xmath2 , there is a unique invariant gibbs measure on the space @xmath80 .    if @xmath2 fails either condition ( a ) or condition ( b ) then there is a set of activities @xmath27 on @xmath2 for which @xmath80 has at least two simple , invariant gibbs measures , and therefore @xmath27 can be obtained by more than one branching random walk .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ main ] is far too complex to reproduce here , but reasonably straightforward in structure .",
    "first , a distinct pair of weightings yielding the same activity vector must be produced for each of the seven baby fertile graphs , and for each @xmath154 .",
    "second , it must be demonstrated that if @xmath2 contains one of the seven as an induced subgraph , then there are weightings ( whose restrictions are close to those previously found ) which induce phase transitions on @xmath80 . third , a monotonicity argument is employed to show that if @xmath2 satisfies conditions ( a ) and ( b ) of the theorem , then the map from @xmath110 to @xmath27 is injective . finally , an easy graph - theoretical argument shows that @xmath2 satisfies ( a ) and ( b ) precisely if it does not contain any of the seven baby fertile graphs as an induced subgraph .",

    "the widom - rowlinson model exhibits spontaneous symmetry - breaking ; indeed its relationship to the ising model parallels the relation between nodes and edges of a graph .",
    "one of the nice properties known for the ising model is that it can exhibit at most one critical point ; but the proof of this fact does not work for the widom - rowlinson model .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the methods above are used to construct a board @xmath1 for which @xmath0 has three ( or more ) calculable critical points , with @xmath2 the hinge . set @xmath166 , fixing @xmath167 , so that the single parameter @xmath27 controls the widom - rowlinson model . then :    [ thm : wr ] there exist @xmath168 and an infinite graph @xmath1 , such that the widom  rowlinson model on @xmath1 with activity @xmath27 has a unique gibbs measure for @xmath169 \\cup [ \\lambda_2 , \\lambda_3]$ ] , and multiple gibbs measures for @xmath170 .    the board @xmath1 constructed in @xcite is a tree , but not quite a regular one ; it is made by dangling seven new pendant sites from each site of @xmath171 .",
    "readers are referred to that paper for the calculations , but the intuition is something like this .    for low @xmath27",
    "the random coloring of @xmath1 is mostly yellow , but as @xmath27 rises , either green or red tends to take over the interior vertices as in @xmath171 . then comes the third interval , where the septuplets of leaves , wanting to use both green and red , force more yellow on the interior vertices , relieving the pressure and restoring green - red symmetry . finally the activity becomes so large that the random coloring is willing to give up red - green variety among the septuplets in order to avoid yellow interior vertices , and symmetry - breaking appears once again .",
    "it turns out that multiple critical points can be obtained for the hard - core model in a similar way .",
    "-5 mm    in addition to the fertile and sterile graphs , a second graph dichotomy appears repeatedly in our studies : dismantlable and non - dismantlable graphs . coincidentally ,",
    "the term `` dismantlable '' as applied to graphs was coined by richard nowakowski and the second author @xcite almost twenty years ago in another context entirely : a pursuit game on graphs .",

    "we will assume that @xmath2 is connected and has at least one edge , although the concepts make sense even without these assumptions .",
    "the cop begins by placing herself at a node of her choice ; the robber then does the same .",
    "then the players alternate beginning with @xmath172 , each moving to an adjacent node .",
    "the cop wins if she can `` capture '' the robber , that is , move onto the node occupied by the robber ; @xmath173 wins by avoiding capture indefinitely . in doing",
    "so @xmath173 is free to move ( or even place himself initially ) onto the same node as the cop , although that would be unwise if the node were looped since then @xmath172 could capture him at her next move .",
    "evidently the robber can win on any loopless graph by placing himself at the same node as the cop and then shadowing her every move ; among graphs in which every node is looped , @xmath172 clearly wins on paths and loses on cycles of length 4 or more .",
    "( in the game as defined in @xcite , there is in effect a loop at every node of @xmath2 . )",

    "we call a gibbs measure of this type `` frozen '' . a frozen state of @xmath279 is illustrated in plate 10 . for more about frozen gibbs measures the reader is referred to @xcite .    in a soft constraint model such as the potts model",
    ", frozen gibbs measures can only occur at zero temperature .",
    "since most of the time statistical physicists are interested only in phases which exist at some positive temperature ( and have positive entropy ) , frozen measures are generally absent from the statistical physics literature .",
    "however , they are interesting combinatorially and motivate some definitions in the next section .",
    "-5 mm      suppose @xmath2 is bipartite and we are given some @xmath280 , where the sites of @xmath100 are labeled by the integers @xmath281 . then knowing @xmath282 even for a very large @xmath36 tells us something about @xmath283 , namely which `` part '' of @xmath2 it is in .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ long range action _ , and define it on cayley trees as follows : if there is a @xmath284 and a node @xmath87 such that for any @xmath36 , no @xmath285 agreeing with @xmath52 on the sites at distance @xmath36 from the root can have spin @xmath57 at the root , we say @xmath80 has long range action .      for example , the coloring described at the end of the previous section , which gives rise to a frozen gibbs measure , shows that @xmath279 ( more generally , @xmath287 ) has long range action .",
    "we also see from theorem  [ equivalent ] that @xmath80 has long range action for _ no _",
    "@xmath77 if and only if @xmath2 is dismantlable ; of course then @xmath2 has at least one loop and therefore has infinite chromatic number .",
    "note that the theorem connects a statement about homomorphisms _ from _ @xmath2 to a statement about homomorphisms _ to _ @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is difficult to see how to turn a @xmath12-coloring of @xmath2 into a suitable map in @xmath286 .",
    "suppose , for instance , that @xmath2 is the 5-cycle @xmath288 , with nodes represented by the integers modulo 5 .",
    "we can get a completely frozen map in @xmath289 by making sure we use both @xmath290 and @xmath291 on the children of any site of spin @xmath57 .",
    "but what has this map got to do with any 3-coloring of @xmath288 ?",
    "we now move from long range action to the familiar notion of connectivity .",
    "theorem  [ equivalent]in fact , the part whose proof is given above  tells us that @xmath0 is connected for any finite @xmath1 just when @xmath2 is dismantlable .",
    "suppose we restrict ourselves to boards of bounded degree ?",
    "if , for example , @xmath2 is bipartite , @xmath292 is already disconnected . if @xmath293 then @xmath294 is extremely disconnected , consisting of @xmath36 !  isolated maps . by analogy with theorem  [ warm ] , we should perhaps be able to prove :      a proof for @xmath295 appears in @xcite and lovsz @xcite has shown that the conjecture holds for @xmath296 as well .",
    "we think that a proof of conjecture  [ mobile ] would have to capture some basic truths about graphs and combinatorial topology , and fervently hope that some reader of these notes will take up the challenge .",
