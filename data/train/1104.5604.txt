    "first , notice that if @xmath15 is a solution of ( [ paux ] ) then @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "hence the definition of lower solution implies that for all @xmath76 we have @xmath82    assume now , reasoning by contradiction , that @xmath83 on @xmath14",
    ". then we can find @xmath84 and @xmath85 such that @xmath86 and @xmath87.$}\\ ] ] therefore , for all @xmath88 $ ] we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 \\subset e(t),\\ ] ] so for a.a .",
    "@xmath91 $ ] we have @xmath92 hence for @xmath88 $ ] we have @xmath93 a contradiction with ( [ cont ] ) .",
    "similar arguments prove that all solutions @xmath15 of ( [ paux ] ) obey @xmath94 on @xmath43 .",
    "_ claim @xmath36 : the set of solutions of problem ( [ p1 ] ) in @xmath47 $ ] has maximal and minimal elements .",
    "_ the set @xmath95\\}\\ ] ] is nonempty and compact in @xmath16 , beacuse it coincides with the set of fixed points of the operator @xmath79 .",

    "definition [ sub - sobre ] is probably the best possible for ( [ p1 ] ) because it reduces to some definitions that one can find in the literature in connection with particular cases of ( [ p1 ] ) . indeed , when the function @xmath31 does not depend on the second variable then for all @xmath39 we have @xmath120 $ ] in definition [ sub - sobre ] .",
