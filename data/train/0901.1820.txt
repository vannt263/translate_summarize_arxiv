    "within a broad range of salt and temperature conditions , the watson - crick double - helix @xcite is the equilibrium structure of dna .",
    "this thermodynamic stability is effected by hydrogen - bonding between paired bases and by base - stacking between nearest neighbor pairs of base pairs @xcite . by an increase of the temperature or by variation of the ph - value ( titration with acid or alkali ) double - stranded dna",
    "progressively denatures , yielding regions of single - stranded dna , until the double - strand is fully molten .",
    "this is the helix - coil transition @xcite .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath0 is defined as the temperature at which half of the dna molecule has undergone denaturation @xcite .",
    "typically , the denaturation starts in regions rich in the weaker a__denine__-t__hymine _ _ base - pairs , and subsequently moves to zones of increasing g__uanine__-c__ytosine _ _ content .",
    "the occurrence of zones of different stability within the genome was shown to be relevant when separating coding from non - coding regions @xcite .    however , already at room temperature thermal fluctuations cause rare opening events of small intermittent denaturation zones in the double - helix @xcite .",
    "these _ dna bubbles _ consist of flexible single - stranded dna , and their size fluctuates by step - wise zipping and unzipping of the base pairs ( bps ) at the zipper forks , where the bubble connects to the intact double - strand .",
    "initiation of a bubble in a stretch of intact double - strand requires the crossing of a free energy barrier @xmath1 of some 8 to 12 @xmath2 at physiological temperature , corresponding to a boltzmann factor , often referred to as the cooperativity factor , @xmath3 .",
    "once formed below the melting temperature @xmath0 , a bubble will eventually zip close . above @xmath0",
    ", a bubble will preferentially stay open and , if unconstrained , grow in size until it merges with other denaturation bubbles , eventually leading to full denaturation of the double - helix .",
    "constraints against such full unzipping could , for instance , be the build - up of twist in smaller dna - rings or the chemical connection of the two strands by short bulge - loops , compare ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "biologically , the physical conformations of dna molecules are considered of increasing relevance for its function , see , for instance , the review @xcite and references therein . in particular , the existence of intermittent ( though infrequent ) bubble domains is important , as the opening up of the watson - crick base pairs by breaking of the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases disrupts the helical stack .",
    "the flipping out of the ordered stack of the unpaired bases allows the binding of specific chemicals or proteins , that otherwise would not be able to access the reactive sites of the bases @xcite .",
    "in fact , there exists a competition of time scales between the opening / closing dynamics of dna - bubbles and the binding kinetics of selectively single - stranded dna binding proteins @xcite . that the chemical potential of the single - stranded binding proteins does not lead to full denaturation of the dna",
    "is due to the slow binding of the proteins when compared to the bubble dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that dna - breathing assists in the transcription initiation process @xcite .",
    "the quantitative knowledge of the denaturation dynamics as well as energetics is imperative to a better understanding of genomic biochemical processes .",
    "dna - breathing has been modeled extensively in terms of the peyrard - bishop model , that is based on a set of langevin equations for the base - base distance in a base pair ; the effective attraction between the bases is represented by model potentials @xcite .",
    "alternatively , dna - breathing can be considered as a random walk process in the free energy landscape of the poland - scheraga model of dna denaturation , as the number of broken base pairs turns out to be the slow variable of the process @xcite . in continuum form , this approach to dna bubble dynamics has been described in terms of a fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "a discrete description , in which the coordinate of the random walker corresponds to a specific base pair , was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the corresponding stochastic simulations analysis of dna breathing was introduced in ref .",
    "the influence of a random energy landscape on bubble localization and dynamics was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , while a framework to include an arbitrary given sequence of base pairs was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . endowed with the sensitivity of their dynamics ,",
    "dna constructs were proposed as nanosensors @xcite .",
    "we note that the formulation in terms of the gradient of the poland - scheraga free energy allows one to explicitly introduce all necessary independent stacking parameters based on the study @xcite , see also the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . measuring the dynamics of dna bubbles also provides information on the magnitude of the critical exponent @xmath4 representing the entropy loss factor of a closed polymer loop , deciding on the order of the denaturation transition @xcite , by influencing the temporal survival probability of bubbles @xcite .",
    "the multi - state nature of _ dna breathing _ can be monitored in real time on the single dna level by fluorescence correlation techniques @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in a quantitative analysis that the experimentally accessible autocorrelation function is sensitive to the stacking parameters of dna @xcite .",
    "however , it has not been fully appreciated to what extent the fluorophore and quencher molecules , that are attached to the dna construct in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , influence the stability of dna .",
    "moreover , the zipping rates measured in the single molecule fluorescence setup differ from those determined in nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "we here propose and study a complementary setup for the single molecule fluorescence investigation of dna breathing , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . in this setup , a short stretch of dna , clamped at both ends ,",
    "is designed such that two soft zones consisting of weaker at - bps are separated by a more stable barrier region rich in gc bps . for simplicity , we assume that both soft zones and barrier are homopolymers with a bp - dissociation free energy @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and , in accordance with the experimental findings of reference @xcite , we neglect secondary structure formation in the barrier zone . at temperatures higher than the melting temperature @xmath7 of the soft zones , but still lower than the melting temperature @xmath8 of the barrier region such that two open bubbles are being promoted , thermal fluctuations will gradually dissociate the barrier , until the two bubbles coalesce",
    ". note that the melting temperature at 100 mm salt conditions differs by approximately 50 degrees between mixed ( at / ta)@xmath9 and ( gc / cg)@xmath9 homopolymers respectively @xcite .",
    "this should provide a large enough temperature interval between hard and soft zones to perform this type of experiment . in the following we use realistic values for the simulations .",
    "once coalesced , the free energy corresponding to one cooperativity factor @xmath10 is released , stabilizing the coalesced bubble against reclosure of the barrier .",
    "this fact should allow for a meaningful measurement of the coalescence time in experiment , and therefore provide a new and sensitive method to measure dna stability data and base pair zipping rates .",
    "we also study the case when the system is prepared as above and then @xmath11 suddenly increased such that @xmath12 so that the system is driven towards coalescence . in both cases the two boundaries between bubbles and barrier perform a ( biased ) random walk in opposite free energy potentials .",
    "in fact , the study of the bubble coalescence is of interest in its own right , as we map the random walk of the two zipper forks separating double - stranded barrier base - pairs from already denatured single - stranded bubble domains onto a new case of the vicious walker problem .",
    "namely , we deal with two vicious walkers in _ linear _ but _ opposite _ potentials .",
    "the viciousness condition corresponds to the fact that when the two zipping forks meet , the bubbles coalesce , and the dynamics is stopped . while the problem of a general number of ( otherwise noninteracting ) vicious walkers in free space was solved long time ago @xcite and has been only relatively recently generalized to the case of motion in a common potential @xcite , even two walkers in different potentials can not be addressed analogously by the straightforward antisymmetrization procedure . to solve our problem in the continuum limit",
    ", we use a trick of introducing individual symmetry transformations for each walker which transform the respective fokker - planck operators to the _ same _ hermitian form . in the transformed frame the problem is solved by the standard procedure constructing the joint probability density from the antisymmetrized product of the single - walker probability densities .",
    "this solution enables us to effectively reduce the numerical efforts needed for the evaluation of the joint probability density , mean coalescence time , spatial probability density of coalescence position , etc .  by one dimension .",
    "moreover , some of the quantities of interest can be obtained this way fully analytically including all the characteristics of the high - barrier case which are very hard to reliably determine numerically .",

    "in this section we define the transition rates for opening or closing a base pair , which are determined by two effects : the energy landscape stemming from the thermodynamical partition factors and the thermal fluctuations .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , we consider the case when the two soft bubble zones of the dna construct are preferentially open , while the central barrier region is initially completely closed .",
    "we assume that the two soft zones are homopolymers with identical melting temperature @xmath7 , and that the barrier region is a homopolymer with melting temperature @xmath13 . in the following ,",
    "we neglect secondary structure formation in the bubbles , consistent with experimental observations in relatively short bubble domains @xcite .",
    "the barrier region of initially closed base - pairs between the zipper forks will also be referred to as the clamp .",
    "each of the two dna - bubbles is characterized by a partition factor of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] denote the positions of the left and right zipper fork , respectively . in eqs .",
    "( [ one ] ) and ( [ two ] ) the quantity @xmath16 , which takes the values @xmath17 , is the boltzmann factor for breaking a base - pair in the soft zone ( barrier domain ) , @xmath18 , corresponding to the free energy @xmath19 for breaking a base - pair ; moreover , @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we define @xmath21 .",

    "is considered in refs .",
    "@xcite in a continuum approach .    finally , @xmath23 is the cooperativity factor corresponding to the free energy barrier for breaking the first base - pair in a stretch of intact double - strand . loosely speaking",
    ", it corresponds to the disruption of two stacking interactions in the dna , while the single open base - pair s entropy gain can not balance the required enthalpy .",
    "this contrasts the opening of further base - pairs , for which the entropy gain almost balances the enthalpy cost .",
    "the cooperativity factor @xmath23 helps stabilizing the coalesced dna stretch against reclosure , as the combined free energy of the two individual bubbles carries a factor @xmath24 while the coalesced bubble has only a factor @xmath23 .",
    "the full partition function is @xmath25 it defines the free energy landscape @xmath26 $ ] , in which the random motion of the zipper forks takes place , as the gradient of @xmath27 with respect to the coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 defines the local driving forces experienced by the two zipper forks .",
    "+ below the melting temperature of the barrier @xmath8 , the barrier will on average be driven towards closure , while above @xmath8 it will tend to denature completely .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations is to introduce a random walk - type dynamics of the position of the two zipper forks .",
    "eventually , full denaturation of the clamp may be reached even below the melting temperature @xmath8 .",
    "once the two bubbles coalesce , the loop initiation ( cooperativity ) factor @xmath23 is released , and the coalesced state becomes stabilized against closure .",
    "dynamically we quantify the random motion of the two zipper forks due to thermal fluctuations as follows .",
    "to zip close an already opened base - pair , we assume that this process is mainly governed by diffusion - limited encounter of the two separated bases , and subsequent bond formation .",
    "in contrast , to unzip a still closed base - pair , the free energy barrier embodied in the boltzmann factor @xmath30 has to be overcome . for the left zipper fork",
    "we define @xmath31 which is the transfer coefficient for the process @xmath32 , corresponding to clamp size decrease , and @xmath33 the transfer coefficient for the process @xmath34 ( clamp size increase ) . for the right zipper fork",
    "we similarly introduce @xmath35 for the process @xmath36 ( clamp size increase ) and @xmath37 for the process @xmath38 ( clamp size decrease ) . due to the end clamping we require that @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which amounts to introducing reflecting boundary conditions and @xmath41 for completeness . ]",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 once the clamp has vanished , we assume that the clamp will not be able to reform for a long time , and we impose the absorbing conditions @xmath44 dynamically , this is connected to the time it takes the long stretch of single - strand to re - establish a base - pair in the clamp region ( diffusion limit ) . in terms of the free energy",
    "the suppression of clamp reformation is due to the release of the free energy @xmath45 corresponding to the cooperativity factor @xmath23 on bubble coalescence ( it would cost the additional factor @xmath23 to reintroduce two single - strand / double - strand boundaries ) .",
    "knowledge of the transfer coefficients together with the boundary conditions above completely determine the dynamics , and we proceed by giving explicit expressions for the transfer coefficients in terms of the physical parameters of the problem . for the zipping rates we choose @xmath46 for the left fork , and identically for the right fork @xmath47 we defined above a bubble - size - dependent rate coefficient @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the number of broken bps in the bubble , where we have , as in previous studies , introduced the hook exponent @xmath50 , related to the fact that during the zipping process not only the base - pair at the zipper fork is moved , but also part of the single - strand is dragged or pushed along .",
    "this additional effect may be included using similar arguments as in refs .",
    "@xcite : to zip close a base - pair , the two single - strands making up the bubble have to be pulled closer towards the zipper fork .",
    "the adjustment of pulling propagates along the contour of the chain until the closest bend ( inflexion ) is reached , a distance that scales as the gyration radius , i.e. @xmath51 . having in mind rouse - type dynamics , this would slow down the unzipping rates by the factor @xmath52 .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions may change the exponent and we here take the transfer coefficients above proportional to @xmath53 , with @xmath50 to be determined by more detailed microscopic investigations . the rate constant @xmath54 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate_coeff ] ) is the rate constant for pure base pair unzipping without factors due to the coupling along the chain , i.e. , the hook exponent .",
    "the factor @xmath55 introduced above in eqs .  , is merely for convenience to be consistent with the nomenclature of previous approaches @xcite .",
    "apart from the hook effect , we thus assign a factor @xmath56 for the zipping at each of the forks .",
    "as the dna construct is embedded in a thermal bath , we require the zipping rates to fulfill the detailed balance conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 these conditions guarantee the relaxation to the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "for the left zipping rates this is fulfilled for @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the length of the left bubble , and again @xmath22 is the correction for the entropy loss of a closed polymer loop , with @xmath4 being the loop exponent . for bubble size increase",
    "we thus take the transfer coefficients to be proportional to the arrhenius - factor @xmath61 , multiplied by a loop correction factor .",
    "note that for @xmath62 the loop correction factor tends to @xmath63 , which we will exploit later . for the right fork",
    "we similarly find @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the length of the right bubble .",
    "we point out that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : t_l_plus ] ) , ( [ eq : t_r_minus ] ) , ( [ eq : t_l_minus ] ) , and ( [ eq : t_r_plus ] ) are not unique in satisfying the detailed balance conditions , eqs .",

    "rates a master equation can be constructed for the conditional probability @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the initial positions of the zipper forks .",
    "this master equation can be solved numerically , details of which are introduced in sec .",
    "[ secme ] , and physical quantities such as the mean - first - passage time density can be calculated .",
    "however , based on four assumptions concerning the transition rates it is possible to derive a continuous fokker - planck equation approximating the full master equation description ; this is done in sec .",
    "[ secmefp ] . from the fokker - planck approach",
    "we then derive numerical results for the coalescence time density , and both numerical and analytic expressions for the mean coalescence time and the probability density for the coalescence position in secs .",

    "finally , the number of bps in the barrier region is much bigger than one , i.e.  @xmath69 , which allows for taking the continuum limit ( see below ) .    under the assumptions ( _ i_)(_iii _ ) the full partition function for the two bubbles and the partially denatured barrier region becomes",
