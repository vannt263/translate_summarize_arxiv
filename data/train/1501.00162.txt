    "our basic task is to estimate estimate the size of a largest bin in a special case of the balls and bins model .",
    "this models simply means that the balls are randomly thrown into bins .",
    "the process of their placement is of a various study ",
    "its randomness , independence and other properties lead to various bin sizes .",
    "the most simple model is to use fully random functions or some kind of their approximation to place the balls .",
    "there is a plenty of results , i.e. estimates of bin sizes , for various placement processes .    when the balls are thrown independently at random to the bins the expected size of the largest bin is @xmath0 .",
    "one of the first results were shown by carter and wegman @xcite and this model was used to design universal and perfect hashing .",
    "they showed that the expected size of a bin is a constant when the placement is done by the functions which we will refer to as simple linear functions .",
    "these functions are two - wise independent and thus achieve @xmath2 expected size of a largest bin .",

    "hence we use two functions , the balls is placed into the smaller one . in this model",
    "the size of the largest bin is @xmath3 where @xmath1 is the number of balls and bins shown by azar et al @xcite and improved by vcking @xcite .",
    "nowadays more complicated family of functions are studied in @xcite .",
    "the functions no longer rely on high degree of independence but are designed so that they achieve small largest bins even with high probability .",
    "our model exhibits the use of simple linear functions and the balls are chosen from an interval in @xmath4 .",
