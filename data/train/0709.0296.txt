    "modern cosmology , with its many successes , is built on the concept of an expanding universe governed by the rules of einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) . assuming a homogeneous and isotropic ansatz for the metric , and given the material constituents , one can use gr to determine how the universe and its content evolve with time .",
    "it has gradually become apparent that , within this construction , ordinary particles and dark matter are not sufficient to describe what we observe .",
    "current data strongly favor a universe that exponentially inflated at an early epoch and , after a period of decelerating expansion dominated by radiation and matter , recently began accelerating again .",
    "within gr , a period of accelerated expansion can only be due to a dominating energy component with a negative equation of state , the most common example being a static , or slowly rolling , scalar field .",
    "alternatively , one can try to avoid postulating new components by modifying gr .    in 1979",
    "starobinsky showed that one can achieve a de sitter phase in the early universe by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath2 in the einstein action with a function @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "starobinsky s model , which is now recognized as the first working model of inflation , is also important as the first model for which the quantum metric fluctuations leading to a nearly scale - invariant initial density spectrum were discovered @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xmath0 models have been revisited in the context of ongoing cosmic acceleration , starting with @xcite and followed by many others .",
    "the models proposed in @xcite achieved late time acceleration by adding inverse powers of @xmath2 to the action , i.e. @xmath4 with @xmath5 . it was later realized @xcite , that these particular types of @xmath0 models posses instabilities which , among other problems , prevent them from having a matter dominated epoch . eventually , in @xcite conditions for cosmological viability of @xmath0 theories were formulated and some explicit models satisfying them were constructed  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "it was explicitly demonstrated in @xcite that it is possible to `` design '' @xmath0 functions with a stable matter era to match any desired expansion history of the universe .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 theories can be recast as gr with an additional scalar field conformally coupled to all matter @xcite .",
    "hence , they are a subset of a wider class of scalar - tensor theories with a fixed value of the coupling strength a `` modification of gravity '' , or treat it as a class of models somehow separate from other scalar - tensor theories . at least from the model - building point of view , they are as a class of models that operationally do not require postulating a dark energy component . ] .",
    "since this coupling is of order one in planck units , it would seem that all @xmath0 models would be automatically ruled out for violating the stringent equivalence principle tests ( ept ) in the solar system and on earth @xcite .",
    "however , just like in the case of chameleon models @xcite , the @xmath0 scalar degree of freedom can be exponentially suppressed in regions of high matter density .",
    "hence , while the ept impose strong constraints on @xmath0 , they do not automatically rule them out @xcite . in section  [ viable ]",
    "we show that the ept constraints only allow @xmath0 models that are practically indistinguishable from the cosmological constant at the background level .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that there can not be differences in the dynamics of perturbations .",
    "in fact , as already shown in @xcite , and as we also demonstrate in this paper , @xmath0 can lead to interesting signatures that can be seen with future weak lensing surveys .",
    "linear perturbations in @xmath0 models have already been studied in @xcite using differing analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "the results were obtained in either jordan or einstein frames , and for particular choices of f(r ) models . in this work",
    ", we identify the general features of perturbation dynamics common to all viable @xmath0 models and connect the results obtained in different frames .",
    "in addition , we show that one can interpret the @xmath0 perturbations in terms of the dynamics of an effective dark energy fluid with a non - zero shear .",
    "we then demonstrate the signature of @xmath0 as would be seen via some recently proposed observational tests aimed at detecting the cosmic shear @xcite .",
    "we start with a review of @xmath0 theories and the conditions for their viability in section [ fofrdescription ] . in section [ perttheory ]",
    "we solve the full set of linear perturbation equations in the jordan frame in the newtonian gauge and present the numerical solutions , as well as an analytical study of the sub - horizon perturbations in both jordan and einstein frames , and in terms of an effective dark energy fluid with a non - zero shear .",
    "we conclude with section [ conclusions ] , where we discuss the prospects of observationally detecting the @xmath0 pattern of structure growth .",
    "we focus on gravity theories described by the action s = d^4 x + d^4 x l_m[_i , g _ ]  , [ jordanaction ] where @xmath6 and @xmath0 is a general function of the ricci scalar , @xmath2 . the matter lagrangian , @xmath7 , is minimally coupled and , therefore , the matter fields , @xmath8 , fall along geodesics of the metric @xmath9 .",
    "the field equations obtained from varying the action  ( [ jordanaction ] ) with respect to @xmath9 are [ jordaneom ] ( 1+f_r ) r _ - g _ ( r+f ) + ( g _ - _ _ ) f_r = ^2 t _  , where we have defined @xmath10 .",
    "we take the energy - momentum tensor to be that of a perfect fluid , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fluid rest - frame four - velocity , @xmath13 is the energy density and @xmath14 is the pressure .",
    "@xmath14 is related to @xmath13 via @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the equation of state parameter ( for pressureless matter @xmath17 and for radiation @xmath18 ) .",
    "when considering the background cosmological evolution , we take the metric to be of the flat friedmann - robertson - walker form , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the conformal time and @xmath21 is the scale factor .",
    "the metric @xmath9 is minimally coupled to matter , hence the stress tensor and its conservation law will be the same as in the standard gr .",
    "in particular , the continuity equation is the usual + 3(+p ) & = & 0  , [ jordancontinuity ] where an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to conformal time and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath0 term in the gravitational action leads to extra terms in the einstein equations , which now become fourth order differential equations ( in contrast to the second order of the equations in standard gr ) .",
    "in particular , for our cosmological ansatz , the friedmann equation becomes ( 1+f_r)^2+f - f_r + _ r & = & a^2[jordanfriedmann ] and the acceleration equation is [ acceleration ] -(1+f_r)^2+a^2+=-a^2(+3p ) one can interpret the extra terms in the einstein equations ( [ jordaneom ] ) as a contribution of an _ effective fluid _ with energy - momentum tensor [ g_eff ] ^2t^eff _ f_rr_-fg_+(g_-__)f_r  . the effect of this fluid on the cosmological background can be described in terms of an effective density [ enden_eff ] _ eff = [(f_r r - f)-3f_r-3_r ]  , and the equation of state [ eos_eff ] w_eff=--  .",
    "this effective fluid approach can facilitate the comparison with dark energy ( de ) models , as well as the interpretation of the effects of modifications to gr .",
    "it is , however , important to keep in mind that the extra terms associated with modifications to gr have a geometrical origin .",
    "by definition , @xmath0 models with the same matter content and the same @xmath23 will have identical background evolution histories .",
    "in fact , for any given function @xmath24 one can solve the differential equation ( [ eos_eff ] ) and find a family of different @xmath0 with the same expansion history but corresponding to different choices of boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , for @xmath25 , eq .  ( [ eos_eff ] ) leads to [ lambda_eos ] _",
    "r-2_r+2(-^2)f_r=0  .",
    "one can then set @xmath26 $ ] and integrate eq .",
    "( [ lambda_eos ] ) to find all @xmath0 that have a @xmath1cdm background expansion history .",
    "analogous equations can be written for any function @xmath24 .    the role of de in eqs .",
    "( [ jordanfriedmann ] ) and ( [ acceleration ] ) is effectively played by the additional terms due to @xmath27 .",
    "there exists , however , a complementary , and sometimes conceptually simpler , way in which to approach @xmath0 theories .",
    "it is possible to conformally transform the metric and bring the gravitational part of the action to the usual einstein - hilbert form of standard gr .",
    "the price one pays for this simplification is a non - minimal coupling between matter fields and the transformed metric @xcite , as well as the appearance of a new scalar degree of freedom playing the role of de and evolving under a potential determined by the original form of the @xmath0 in ( [ jordanaction ] ) . assuming the transformation between the two frames is always well - defined",
    ", the results obtained using either description should be the same . the frame in which matter particles fall along the geodesics of the metric , while the form of the gravitational part of the action may be modified , is referred to as the _ jordan frame_. the frame in which the gravitation part of the action is the same as in standard gr , while the matter may be non - minimally coupled to gravity , is called the _ einstein frame_. in the present paper we primarily work in the jordan frame .",
    "when discussing the perturbations , we will make the connection between the jordan and einstein frame descriptions .",
    "the description of the einstein frame version of @xmath0 theories and the mapping between the two frames can be found in appendix [ conformal ] .",
    "the emergence of an additional scalar degree of freedom can be seen directly in the jordan frame .",
    "the role of the scalar field is played by @xmath28 , dubbed _ scalaron _ in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the trace of eq  ( [ jordaneom ] ) can be written as _ r=13(r+2f - rf_r ) -^2 3(-3p )  , which is a second order equation for a field @xmath28 with a canonical kinetic term and an effective potential @xmath29 . by design",
    ", the @xmath0 theories we consider must have @xmath30 and @xmath31 at high curvatures to be consistent with our knowledge of the high redshift universe . in this limit",
    ", the extremum of the effective potential lies at the gr value @xmath32 .",
    "whether this extremum is a minimum or a maximum is determined by the second derivative of @xmath33 at the extremum , which is also the squared mass of the scalaron : m^2_f_r = 13  . at high curvatures ,",
    "when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , m^2_f_r  .",
    "it then follows that in order for the scalaron not to be tachyonic one must require @xmath36 .",
    "classically , @xmath36 is required to keep the evolution in the high curvature regime stable against small perturbations @xcite .",
    "the scalaron mediates an attractive `` fifth force '' , which has a range determined by the compton wavelength [ lambda_c ] _ c  .",
    "while @xmath37 is large at current cosmological densities , terrestrial , solar and galactic tests are not necessarily violated because the scalaron acquires a larger mass in regions of high matter density .",
    "this is essentially the chameleon mechanism of @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the @xmath38th order nature of @xmath0 theories provides enough freedom to reproduce any cosmological background history by an appropriate choice of the @xmath0 function @xcite .",
    "instead of using eq.([eos_eff ] ) , we integrate the modified friedmann equation ( [ jordanfriedmann ] ) directly to find @xmath0 models with specified expansion histories . in this subsection",
    "we describe this `` designer '' procedure , which generalizes that of @xcite to include a radiation component and to allow for a time - dependent @xmath24 .    as in @xcite , let us introduce dimensionless variables [ dimensionless ] y  ,  e  , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the physical time , and @xmath41 is the hubble parameter today .",
    "we fix the desired expansion history to that of a flat universe containing matter , radiation and dark energy with a given equation of state .",
    "namely , we set [ e(x ) ] e=_m a^-3 + _ r a^-4 + _ eff/_c^0e_m+e_r+e_eff + with [ rhoeff ] e_eff= ( 1-_m-_r )  , where @xmath42 is the critical density today , @xmath43 are present day fractions of matter and radiation densities and we have defined @xmath44 ( that will be used later in the perturbation equations ) .",
    "the other background functions that appear in the modified friedmann equation ( [ jordanfriedmann ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath45 and its derivatives .",
    "for example , = 3(4e+e )  . where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "substituting ( [ e(x ) ] ) into eq.([jordanfriedmann ] ) yields a second order equation for @xmath47 : y- ( 1+e2e + rr)y+r 6h_0 ^ 2ey",
    "= - r h_0 ^ 2e e_eff  .",
    "[ y2prime ] in order to set the initial conditions , let us consider the general and the particular solutions of ( [ y2prime ] ) at early times , when the effects of the effective dark energy on the expansion are negligible . at a certain early value @xmath48 ,",
    "the homogeneous part of ( [ y2prime ] ) is satisfied by a power law ansatz @xmath49 . substituting this ansatz in and solving the quadratic equation for @xmath50 yields p_=12 ( -b )  , where b=7 + 8 r_i 2(1+r_i )  ,  c=-32 ( 1+r_i )  ,  r_i = a_eq a_i  , and @xmath51 is the scale factor at the radiation - matter equality .",
    "the decaying mode solution corresponding to @xmath52 leads to a large @xmath0 at early times which makes it unacceptable , and we set its amplitude to zero .",
    "the particular solution at @xmath48 can be found by substituting y_p = a_p e_eff(a_i ) into ( [ y2prime ] ) , where @xmath53 is given by ( [ rhoeff ] ) .",
    "one then finds a_p=-6c -3w_eff+9w_eff^2+(18 - 3b)w_eff+9 - 3b+c  .",
    "put together , the initial conditions at @xmath48 are y_i&=&a e^p_+a_i + y_p + y_i&=&p_+a e^p_+a_i - 3[1+w_eff(a_i ) ] y_p  , [ eq : initial ] and @xmath54 is the remaining arbitrary constant that can be used to parametrize different @xmath0 models with the same expansion history .",
    "while it is possible to find @xmath0 models that reproduce any given expansion history , they must satisfy additional conditions to be consistent with existing experimental and observational data . in this subsection",
    "we summarize these requirements and examine their implications for the acceptable range of values of @xmath23 .",
    "the most common argument against @xmath0 theories is based on their identification with scalar - tensor gravities @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that in the metric formalism considered here , @xmath0 corresponds to a brans - dicke theory with @xmath55 @xcite . since low values of @xmath56",
    "have long been ruled out by solar system tests , it would appear that any @xmath0 theory is automatically ruled out .",
    "however , it is also known @xcite that in regions of high concentration of matter , the non - minimally coupled scalar degree of freedom acquires additional mass and , therefore , can be strongly suppressed . in such situations , simple arguments based on the formal equivalence with brans - dicke",
    "are insufficient to make conclusive statements about viability of @xmath0 theories . instead",
    ", one can formulate a set of requirements for these theories to satisfy in order to pass all of the tests . while these requirements are quite strict and generally discourage large deviations of @xmath0 from the trivial case of a cosmological constant ( @xmath57 ) , there can be room for non - trivial observable differences .",
    "such differences are interesting to understand in some detail and work has already been done on this in @xcite    below we list and discuss the conditions that @xmath0 models of cosmic acceleration must satisfy in order to be viable .    1 .   [ cond:1 ] @xmath36 for @xmath58 .",
    "classically , this follows from requiring the existence of a stable high - curvature regime , such as the matter dominated universe @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , @xmath59 ensures that the scalaron is non - tachyonic .",
    "[ cond:2 ] @xmath60 at all finite @xmath2 .",
    "the most direct interpretation of this condition is that the effective newton constant , @xmath61 , is not allowed to change sign . among classical implications of @xmath62",
    "is the universe quickly becoming inhomogeneous and anisotropic @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical significance of this condition is in preventing the graviton from turning into a ghost @xcite .",
    "[ cond:3 ] @xmath63 .",
    "given tight constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , we want regular gr to be recovered at early times , i.e. @xmath64 and @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "together with @xmath36 , this implies that @xmath28 must be a negative , monotonically increasing function of @xmath2 that asymptots to @xmath67 from below .",
    "[ cond : chameleon ] @xmath28 must be small at recent epochs .",
    "this is not required if the only aim is to build a model of cosmic acceleration , without trying to satisfy the solar and galactic scale constraints .",
    "this condition ensures a small difference between the value of the scalaron field in the high density galactic center and the value in the outskirts of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the difference between these values is effectively the potential difference that sources the attractive `` fifth '' force acting on objects in the vicinity of the galaxy .",
    "analysis of @xcite suggests that the value of @xmath68 today should not exceed @xmath69 .",
    "as stressed in @xcite , this bound assumes that in @xmath0 models galaxy formation proceeds similarly to that in gr .",
    "hence , while it is certain that @xmath68 must be small , any specific bound on its value today will be unreliable until galaxy formation in @xmath0 is studied in n - body numerical simulations .",
    "these restrictions reduce the space of allowed values of @xmath23 .",
    "namely , there are functions @xmath24 for which none of the solutions of eq.([y2prime ] ) satisfy all of the above conditions . to understand this better ,",
    "let us examine a typical solution of eq.([y2prime ] ) for a given expansion history .",
    "it can be written as a sum of the solution of the homogeneous part of the equation plus the particular solution . during the radiation and matter domination the homogeneous part of eq.([y2prime ] ) is only weakly dependent on @xmath23 .",
    "in that regime , the main impact of @xmath24 is through the driving term on the rhs of eq.([y2prime ] ) which sets the time dependence of the particular solution . to gain intuition into which @xmath23 are viable",
    ", one could first `` turn off '' the homogeneous part by setting @xmath70 in ( [ eq : initial ] ) and see if the above conditions are satisfied . then",
    ", if any of the conditions are violated , one could try to remedy the situation by a suitable choice of @xmath54 .",

    "the three solid black lines correspond to @xmath25 with @xmath70 ( f=-2@xmath1 ) , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) and @xmath74 ( @xmath75 , @xmath63 ) .",
    "the red short - dashed line corresponds to @xmath76 with @xmath70 .",

    "the particular solution is a constant . in this case , all positive values of @xmath54 result in solutions satisfying conditions  [ cond:1 ] and [ cond:3 ] , while all solutions with negative @xmath54 have @xmath86 and @xmath73 .",
    "one can also satisfy condition  [ cond : chameleon ] by choosing an appropriate @xmath54 in order to make @xmath68 as small as needed .",

    "@xmath70 corresponds to the case of the cosmological constant , @xmath87 .",
    "let us next consider models with a constant @xmath88 .",
    "particular solutions in the case of @xmath85 are unacceptable because they lead to @xmath0 that violate conditions  [ cond:1 ] and [ cond:3 ] , as can be seen from the red short - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fofrw ] .",
    "one could try to remedy the situation by choosing a sufficiently large positive @xmath54 , to make @xmath36 .",
    "however , all such attempts lead to models that initially have @xmath86 and then cross through @xmath89 at some finite @xmath2 . such models would have instabilities and hence @xmath90 is not allowed .",
    "models with @xmath91 are generally better behaved , since the corresponding particular solution satisfies conditions  [ cond:1 ] and [ cond:3 ] as can be seen by looking at the dot - dashed blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fofrw ] .",
    "one does run into troubles , however , when trying to satisfy condition  [ cond : chameleon ] by making @xmath68 small today with a suitable choice of a negative @xmath54 .",
    "then the particular solution will still force @xmath68 to grow in time at high r , while the homogeneous part will bring it down to a small value today .",
    "such @xmath28 will have a turning point and , hence , will violate both conditions  [ cond:1 ] and [ cond:3 ] .",
    "this case is illustrated with a blue dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fofrw ] .",
    "however , if one chose to only study cosmological implications of @xmath0 and ignore the galactic and solar constraints , then histories with @xmath91 would generally be acceptable .",
    "one gains more flexibility by allowing for a time - dependent equation of state .",
    "in particular , it is possible to construct @xmath0 that have @xmath23 crossing @xmath92 without violating conditions  [ cond:1 ] and [ cond:3 ] .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fofrw ] , where the long - dashed green line corresponds to a model that has @xmath77 at early times and transitions to @xmath81 at redshift of @xmath93 .",
    "quite generally , condition  [ cond : chameleon ] discourages large deviations of @xmath23 from @xmath92 , since otherwise one must deal with turning points in @xmath28 at finite values of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , if we want to have reasonable physics on solar and galactic scales , we must have @xmath94 . as a consequence ,",
    "if future data actually finds any deviations from @xmath25 , it would automatically rule all @xmath0 models out . only if galactic and solar tests are ignored , a richer variety of expansion histories can be considered . for the numerical analysis in the rest of this paper",
    "we will only use models with @xmath25 .",
    "let us remark that , while such designer models appear extremely contrived , they are not necessarily more fine - tuned than quintessence dark energy models in terms of the number of free parameters .",
    "one could argue , in addition , that a universal order one coupling of the scalar field to matter is better motivated by high energy physics , where dilaton fields can appear naturally .",
    "producing minimally coupled scalar fields requires additional fine - tuning . from the observational point of view",
    ", a quintessence dark energy with @xmath95 would be impossible to distinguish from @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 models , on the other hand , predict a @xmath1cdm background expansion but detectably different dynamics of structure formation .",
    "an additional potential problem with @xmath0 models of `` dark energy '' was recently pointed out by starobinsky @xcite .",
    "he observed that the perturbation @xmath96 of the ricci scalar in @xmath0 models in the high curvature limit is a rapidly oscillating function of time , with an amplitude that can easily be larger than the average value of @xmath2 .",
    "an oscillating background could lead to an overproduction of scalaron particles that would impact the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "commenting on the quantum particle production would go beyond the scope of this paper , although this is an important issue that should be further examined and clarified . at the classical level , however , it would seem that large rapid oscillations of @xmath2 do not necessarily imply a problem .",
    "@xmath2 is constructed from derivatives of the metric , so perturbations of the metric can remain tiny even when their derivatives are large when they undergo very rapid oscillations .",
    "in fact , as we show in the next section , the metric potentials and the density perturbations are well behaved , despite @xmath96 being large and oscillatory . in the equations for the metric",
    ", @xmath96 always appears pre - multiplied by the small factor @xmath97 which keeps the metric perturbations in the linear regime .",
    "we consider scalar perturbations in the newtonian gauge , with the line element given by [ metric ] ds^2= -a^2(1 + 2)d^2+a^2(1 - 2)d|x^2  , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are small time and space - dependent perturbations to the metric . in the rest of the paper",
