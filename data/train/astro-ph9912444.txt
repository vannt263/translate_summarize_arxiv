    "most of the sources which are now discussed to explain grbs ( the coalescence of two compact objects or the collapse of a massive star to a black hole ( collapsar ) @xcite ) lead to the same system : a stellar mass black hole surrounded by a thick debris torus . the release of energy by such",
    "a configuration can come from the accretion of disk material by the black hole or from the rotational energy of the black hole extracted by the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "the released energy is first injected into a relativistic wind and then converted into gamma ",
    "rays , via the formation of shocks probably within the wind itself @xcite .",
    "the wind is finally decelerated by the external medium which leads to a shock responsible for the afterglow emission observed in the x ",
    "rays , optical and radio bands @xcite .",
    "the production of the relativistic wind is a very complex question because of the very low baryonic load that has to be achieved in order to reach high values of the terminal lorentz factor .",
    "just a few ideas have been proposed and none appears to be fully conclusive . a first possibility to extract the energy from accretion is the annihilation of neutrino  antineutrino pairs emitted by the hot disk along the rotation axis of the system , which is a region strongly depleted in baryons due to centrifugal forces .",
    "the low efficiency of this process however requires high neutrino luminosities and therefore short accretion time scales @xcite .",
    "another possibility to extract the energy from accretion is to assume that the magnetic field in the disk is amplified by differential rotation to very large values ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "a magnetically driven wind could then be emitted from the disk with a fraction of the poynting flux being eventually transferred to matter .",
    "the energy can also be extracted from the rotational energy of the black hole by the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite .",
    "+ we present here an exploratory study of the case where a magnetically driven wind is emitted by the disk .",
    "matter is heated at the basis of the wind ( by @xmath3 annihilation , viscous dissipation , magnetic reconnection , etc . ) and then escapes , guided along the magnetic field lines .",
    "section [ sec_toymodel ] describes a `` toy model '' to explore the behavior of such a wind . despite its extreme simplicity",
    ", we expect that it can help to identify the key parameters controlling the baryonic load .",
    "our results are presented in section [ sec_results ] and discussed in section [ sec_discussion ] in the context of different scenarios for grbs .",
    "we solve the wind equations with the following simplifications : ( i ) we assume a geometrically thin disk and a poloidal magnetic field with the most simple geometry ( straight lines making an angle @xmath4 with the disk ) ; ( ii ) we consider that a stationnary regime has been reached by the wind ; ( iii ) we use non  relativistic equations ( to obtain the mass loss rate we just need to solve them up to the sonic point , where @xmath5 ) but we adopt the paczyski - wiita potential for the black hole + @xmath6 we write the flow equations ( continuity , euler and energy equations ) in a frame corotating with the foot of the field line , anchored at a radius @xmath7 in the disk @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the distance along the magnetic field line , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the density , pressure , specific internal energy and velocity in the flow .",
    "the total acceleration @xmath15 includes both gravitational and centrifugal terms . in this exploratory study",
    "the power deposited per unit mass @xmath16 only takes into account the heating and cooling due to neutrinos .",
    "we assume that the inner part of the disk is optically thick ( which is probably justified for compact object mergers but is more questionnable for collapsars except for low @xmath17viscosity ( @xmath18 ) @xcite ) .",
    "we include the following processes : neutrinos capture on free nucleons , neutrino scattering on relativistic electrons and positrons and neutrino  antineutrino annihilation ( heating ) ; neutrino emission by nucleons and annihilation of electron  positrons pairs ( cooling ) .",
    "the temperature distribution in the disk corresponds to a gemetrically thin , optically thick disk : @xmath19 the section of the wind @xmath20 is easily related to the field geometry because the field and stream lines are coincident .",
    "we adopt the equation of state computed by @xcite which includes nucleons , relativistic electrons and positrons and photons .",
    "+ the acceleration @xmath15 along a field line is negative up to @xmath21 for angles larger than @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the exact value for a newtonian instead of a paczyski  wiita black hole potential ) . for @xmath24 , @xmath15 is dominated by the centrifugal force .",
    "the sonic point of the flow is located at a distance @xmath25 just below @xmath26 ( the relative difference never exceeds @xmath27 ) .",
    "we solve the flow equations in a classical way by inward integration along the field line .",
    "we start at the sonic point by fixing trial values of the temperature @xmath28 and the density @xmath29 from which we get the velocity @xmath30 and the position @xmath25 ( from the condition of regularity at @xmath31 ) and then the value of the mass loss rate @xmath32 .",
    "we observe that at some position @xmath33 , the velocity @xmath14 begins to fall off rapidly while @xmath34 reaches a maximum @xmath35 .",
    "we adjust @xmath28 and @xmath29 so that @xmath33 is as close as possible to @xmath36 and @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the mass loss rate @xmath32 on the different model parameters and found the following expression : @xmath39\\",
    "\\rm g / cm^{2}/s\\ .\\ ] ] the geometrical function @xmath40 is normelized in such a way that it is equal to unity for @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the very strong dependance of @xmath32 with @xmath43 ( tenth power ) is in agreement with what is found for neutrino driven winds in spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_mdot ] shows that @xmath32 also strongly depends on the inclination angle .",
    "the other important parameters are the position in the disk and the mass of the black hole , while @xmath32 depends only weakly on all other parameters like the size of the optically thick region ( here @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) . in the more general case where the source of heating is not restricted to neutrino processes but can also include viscous dissipation , magnetic reconnection , etc , we have obtained a very simple and general analytical approximation for @xmath32 @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the rate of energy deposition ( in @xmath48 ) between the plane of the disk ( @xmath49 ) and the sonic point ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 is the difference of potential ( gravitational+centrifugal ) between @xmath49 and @xmath21 and @xmath52 is a factor close to unity depending on the distribution of energy injection between @xmath49 and @xmath31 .",
    "+    we can now estimate the average lorentz factor @xmath53 at infinity .",
    "the total mass loss rate @xmath54 and the power injected into the wind @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 x dx$ ] is a function of the field geometry only ; @xmath58 is the burst power in gamma ",
    "rays , @xmath59 is the beaming factor and @xmath60 is the efficiency for the conversion of kinetic energy into gamma  rays .",
    "the wind is powered by accretion but at the same time the disk is heated by viscous dissipation and cools by emitting neutrinos .",
    "we assume that these losses represent a fraction @xmath17 of the power @xmath55 injected into the wind , so that we can estimate @xmath61 at @xmath62 : @xmath63 from equations ( [ eq_m ] ) , ( [ eq_e ] ) and ( [ eq_t ] ) , we can calculate the average lorentz factor @xmath64 the value of @xmath65 is @xmath66 for a constant inclination @xmath67 and @xmath68 if @xmath4 decreases from @xmath69 to @xmath70 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we therefore conclude that large terminal lorentz factors can be reached only if several severe constraints are satisfied : ( i ) low @xmath65 values , i.e. quasi  vertical field lines ; ( ii ) low @xmath17 values , i.e. good efficiency for energy injection into the wind with little dissipation ; ( iii ) low value of @xmath73 , i.e. necessity of beaming . with the more general equation ( [ eq_approx ] )",
    "we can obtain another simple and useful constraint : if the power @xmath47 deposited below the sonic point represents a fraction @xmath74 of the total power @xmath75 injected into the wind , we have @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath78 and @xmath79 which implies that @xmath74 should not exceed @xmath80 to have @xmath81 !",
    "this study is clearly limited by its crude assumptions . however the severe constraints we get show how difficult it may be to produce a relativistic mhd wind from the disk .",
    "an optimistic view of our results would be to consider that this difficulty could just be a way to explain the apparent discrepancy between the observed rate of grbs and the birthrate of sources in the collapsar scenario , most collapsars failing to give a grb .",
    "a more pessimistic point of view would be to conclude that the baryonic load of such winds is never sufficiently low so that they remain non relativistic . if one choose to rely on the blandford - znajek mechanism to power the wind @xcite it should however be checked that this process is not `` contaminated '' by frozen material carried along magnetic field lines coming from the disk and trapped by the black hole .",
