    "why this paper ?",
    "+ since more than @xmath4 years does thermo - statistics emphasize the canonical- or the grand - canonical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit as the appropriate microscopic description of an equilibrized system . here",
    "a _ homogeneous _",
    ", practically infinite , system is controlled by intensive parameters like the temperature .",
    "though in textbooks the microcanonical ensemble is considered as the fundamental ensemble , due to mathematical difficulties it is quickly left in favor of the canonical ones .",
    "intensive variables like temperature , pressure and chemical potential are used instead of the mechanical defined extensive energy , volume and particle number .",
    "the intensive variables are even canonized to found the axiomatic definition of an orthode  @xcite from where statistical mechanics ( at least its intensive or canonical form ) is deduced .",
    "lebowitz  @xcite considers the thermodynamic limit and elliott lieb  @xcite extensivity , which also needs the thermodynamic limit to ignore surface effects , as the condition sine - qua - non .    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath5",
    "all surface effects may be ignored .",
    "  usually   it is clear that this approach can not do justice to phase separations .",
    "in fact , the gain in entropy when a system splits into different phases by interphase surfaces is the essence of phase transitions of first order .",
    "a liquid - gas transition is experimentally detected just by the interface between the liquid and the gas .",
    "consequently , in the ( grand)-canonical approach , phase - transitions are indicated by the yang - lee singularities  @xcite where the grand - canonical potentials are non - analytic in @xmath6 or singular .",
    "these indicate the break - down of the ( grand)-canonical formalism . in remarkable contrast",
    ", the microcanonical ensemble has no problems at phase - separations and the microcanonical density of states remains single - valued and multiply differentiable in all conserved control parameters also here , see below .",
    "this is certainly the strongest argument in favor of the fundamental significance of the micro - ensemble .    at phase - separation",
    "the entropy @xmath7 has a positive curvature .",
    "ruppeiner s riemannian geometry of fluctuations  @xcite must be reformulated there as pseudo - riemannian .",
    "this leads to a negative heat capacity and a violation of clausius formulation of the second law ( `` heat flows always from the hot to the cold system '' ) .",
    "phase - separations demand an essential , fundamental , change of conventional classical thermo - statistics .",
    "thermodynamics , however , was invented in the @xmath8.century to explain the working of steam engines .",
    "i.e. one of its primary issues were just phase - separations .",
    "what was said applies to large systems with short - range forces .",
    "the largest systems in nature , self - gravitating astro - physical systems , are subjected to forces ( gravitation ) with a range comparable to the linear extension of the system .",
    "these systems are naturally inhomogeneous and non - extensive .",
    "a description of their equilibrium by intensive variables with a homogeneous spatial distribution misses these most interesting situations .",
    "ironically , the thermodynamic limit does not apply to these really large systems .",
    "tsallis  @xcite on the other hand addresses non - extensive systems explicitely but keeps the description in terms of intensive variables which fix the relevant conserved parameters only on average .",
    "however , non - extensive systems are usually not self - averaging .",
    "he believes the equilibrium statistics of hamiltonians systems demands a new definition of entropy .",
    "this , is not so  @xcite , see section  [ gravit ] .",
    "it is well known that self - gravitating systems collapse to a star in a more or less void background at low energies , the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' @xcite .",
    "this is of course quite interesting but outside of any homogeneous canonical thermodynamics .",
    "there is nothing peculiar with this in microcanonical thermodynamics .",
    "certainly , angular - momentum can change this essentially .",
    "however , the microcanonical equilibrium configuration of a self - gravitating system under larger angular - momentum has not been investigated yet ( exception  @xcite ) .",
    "i will show in section  [ gravit ] how the competition between gravitational collapse and centrifugal disruption leads in a natural manner to a breaking of rotational symmetry and to multi - star configurations with a large variety of different but quite realistic configurations . in this section",
    "the global phase diagram of self - gravitating and rotating many - body systems as function of energy and angular - momentum is presented , c.f .",
    "it is for the first time that these various realistic stellar configurations are interpreted as global equilibrium configurations .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is also invoked since boltzmann to deduce the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite from microscopic reversible dynamics .",
    "then zermelo s  @xcite paradox becomes blunted as the poincarr recurrence time @xmath9 is much longer than any physically relevant observation time .",
    "this is different for a finite , eventually small system .",
    "by all these reasons a reinvestigation of the microscopic foundation of statistical mechanics starting from newtonian _",
    "reversible _ mechanics of the _ finite _ many - body system using a minimum of assumptions but avoiding the thermodynamic limit is highly needed .",
    "the `` geometric foundation of thermo - statistics '' proposed in  @xcite and further developed here offers a new , deeper , and much simpler understanding of the microscopic foundation of thermodynamics .",
    "the relative fluctuations of a macroscopic observable @xmath10 in pure phases of an extensive system vanish in the large @xmath11 limit : @xmath12 we call this behavior .",
    "then the probability aspect of statistics becomes unimportant .",
    "here we want to study also non - extensive situations , therefore , we are not allowed to go to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "fluctuations must be taken seriously .      then , most axioms which are mistaken to be fundamental for statistical mechanics even turn out to be violated :    * phase transitions ( _ do not _ ) exist only in the thermodynamic limit * specific heat is ( _ not _ ) @xmath13 or @xmath14 * heat does ( _ not _ ) always flow from hot to cold * thermodynamic stability does ( _ not _ ) necessarily imply the concavity of + @xmath7 * ( _ no _ ) extensivity of @xmath15 , ( _ no _ ) scaling with @xmath11 * ( _ no _ ) unique legendre mapping , @xmath16 , etc . *",
    "rise of entropy is ( _ not _ ) necessarily connected to trend towards uniformization * second law ( _ not _ ) only in infinite systems , i.e. second law ( _ not _ ) only when the recurrence time is much larger than the observation - time @xmath17 * a system at equilibrium is ( _ not _ ) necessarily an orthode in the sense of gallavotti  @xcite .",
    "`` boltzmann s heat theorem '' , i.e. @xmath18 is ( _ not _ ) necessarily a total differential @xmath19 , because @xmath20 is not always a smooth , one valued , function of @xmath21 , see section [ order parameter ] , order parameter .",
    "violations of these gospels seem shocking statements : + lebowitz  @xcite and lieb@xcite believe these make thermo - statistics impossible to exist",
    ". nevertheless these violations are valid building stones of statistics .",
    "they are even necessary for thermo - statistics to apply to the original goal of thermodynamics , the description of phase - separation , the scenario in which steam engines do work . at closer inspection",
    "these violations are not so strange . recapitulating the main roots of statistical mechanics we will see that it makes a lot of sense to formulate it without invoking the above axioms and without using the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the only essential axiom needed to define equilibrium statistics is boltzmann s principle c.f .",
    "section [ boltzmanns principle ] , eq.([boltzmentr1 ] ) , once we agree not to use the thermodynamic limit . to concentrate on",
    "this is a great advantage as this principle has a very simple _ geometrical _ meaning .",
    "it is a benefit of the new , extended theory which i offer here , that by reducing its axiomatic basis to this single principle it applies also to hamiltonian non - extensive systems and among them to the really large systems as astrophysical ones , which are far larger than the thermodynamic `` limit '' of any homogeneous system allows .",
    "a whole new world for applications of thermo - statistics opens .",
    "of course , then one can not separate volume from surface effects .",
    "this is anyhow dubious for non - extensive systems or at phase - separation .    here",
    "however , i must make it very clear that in any cases where the thermodynamic limit of a homogeneous phase does exist , the geometrical theory is in complete agreement with conventional thermodynamics and conventional extensive statistical mechanics .",
    "thermodynamics is a macroscopic description of a many - body system within a few ( @xmath22 ) macroscopic control parameters and where ( @xmath23 ) dof s remain uncontrolled .",
    "therefore , thermodynamics describes all systems with the same @xmath24 simultaneously .",
    "all systems under the same macroscopic constraints are simultaneously addressed by the theory .",
    "statistical mechanics describes the whole @xmath25 dimensional manifold , i.e. all points in then @xmath11-body phase - space with same energy @xmath26 , the microcanonical ensemble @xmath27 . ] .",
    "consequently , it gives only _ probabilistic _ predictions how the _ average _ of the systems in the ensemble behave  @xcite .",
    "a large extensive system in a pure phase is self - averaging . in the thermodynamic limit a sharp peak of the probability distribution guarantees the identity of the average with the most likely configuration .",
    "bur what if the thermodynamic limit does not exist like for a non - extensive system ?",
    "for a small system like a nucleus or an atomic cluster the same measurement must be performed very often and the average be taken before its thermodynamic behavior can be seen .      the key quantity of statistics and thermodynamics is the _ entropy _ @xmath15 .",
    "its most fundamental definition is as the logarithm of the _ area _",
    "@xmath28 of the manifold @xmath27 in the n - body phase - space by boltzmann s principle  @xcite :    @xmath29    @xmath30     + _ boltzmann s principle is the only axiom necessary for thermo - statistics . _ with it statistical mechanics and also thermodynamics become _ geometric _ theories .",
    "for instance all kinds of phase - transitions are entirely determined by _ topological _ peculiarities of @xmath31 and thus of @xmath7 see below .",
    "+ in microcanonical statistics the `` extensive '' , better conserved , control parameters as energy , volume , particle number etc . can be determined macroscopically sharp .",
    "there may well be small , microscopic violations of some microscopic conservation laws due to the non - ideal nature of the container .",
    "therefore , we allow small fluctuations in these microscopically conserved quantities . evidently , it does not matter whether the entropy @xmath32 has an extremum or not .",

    "it is uniquely defined by eqs .",
