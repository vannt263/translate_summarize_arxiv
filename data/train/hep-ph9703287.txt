    "one of the remarkable properties of the @xmath2 standard model is the cancellation of the triangle anomalies , which is implied by the relation @xmath3 between the electromagnetic and the left and righthanded weak charges of the leptons and quarks for each fermion family .",
    "this relation is of fundamental importance , because it renders the standard model renormalizable .",
    "although not being enforced by every possible scenario , it might be a dynamical consequence of an as yet unknow underlying theory .    in many extensions of the standard model new bosons , the leptoquarks  @xmath4 , which carry both lepton and baryon number , are predicted .",
    "this applies both to grand unified theories  @xcite as well as models based on compositeness  @xcite or technicolor  @xcite .",
    "whereas in grand unified theories leptoquarks emerge as gauge bosons with masses in the range of @xmath5 and couplings which do not conserve baryon ( b ) and lepton ( l ) number , other approaches contain also leptoquarks with b- and l - conserving couplings .",
    "these particles may have masses in the range which is accessible at the present high energy colliders .",
    "recently , the h1 experiment  @xcite at hera observed 12 events in the range of large bjorken @xmath0 for @xmath6 expecting 4.7 events .",
    "the seven excess events of h1 cluster around @xmath7 .",
    "the zeus experiment  @xcite found 4 events for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where 0.9 events are expected .",
    "still the statistics is low and further measurements are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn .",
    "if the observed excess is confirmed at larger statistics , one of the possible explanations could be single leptoquark production at a mass @xmath10 ,  cf .",
    "@xcite .    in this note",
    "we summarize the current experimental limits on the couplings and masses for scalar and vector leptoquarks and investigate to which extent this interpretation is compatible with experimental results obtained at other high energy colliders .",
    "direct searches for leptoquarks were performed in @xmath11 annihilation-  @xcite , @xmath12-  @xcite , and @xmath13 scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "the currently most stringent mass limits , which are independent of the fermionic couplings , were derived by the tevatron experiments ( see  @xcite ) searching for leptoquark pair production  @xcite .",
    "the following mass ranges are excluded  : @xmath14 in deriving the above bounds it was assumed that the branching fractions into the charged lepton - quark and neutrino - quark final states are equal as a working hypothesis .",
    "rigorous theoretical predictions on the branching fractions do not exist . for leptoquarks with a purely righthanded fermion coupling , however , the decay @xmath15 is not possible on tree level , leading to @xmath16 .",
    "the h1 experiment  @xcite observed a high mass excess for @xmath17 and @xmath18 final states .",
    "if both effects are interpreted in terms of a leptoquark signal the branching fraction is @xmath19 .",
    "a preliminary result was reported by the d0 collaboration from the analysis of run ib  @xcite yielding @xmath20 the above bound on 3rd generation vector leptoquarks was derived assuming the minimal vector coupling to the gluon , @xmath21 , see section  4 . for the case",
    "that the coupling of the vector leptoquark pair to the gluon is of the yang  mills type , @xmath22 , the mass range @xmath23 is excluded . note that the bound of @xmath24 becomes weaker considering besides the anomalous coupling @xmath25 a second anomalous coupling @xmath26 , as shown in ref .",
    "mass limits from the tevatron data for vector leptoquarks associated to the first and second fermion generation were not presented yet .",

    "although at the current statistics one can not get a decisive answer , it is instructive to look on the @xmath64 averages . as an example , one obtains for the 7 events of h1 @xmath66 in the range @xmath67 .",
    "the average @xmath64-values for a scalar or vector leptoquark in this range are @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , while for the standard deep inelastic @xmath70 cross section @xmath71 is obtained for comparison .",
    "this shows , how difficult a distinction between the different hypotheses might be , since the average value for the case of vector leptoquarks is nearly the same as for the deep inelastic sample in this range of @xmath64 . at a larger statistics a @xmath72-analysis may yield a definite answer .",
    "aside of the fusion process @xmath73 , leptoquarks should also be produced via the processes @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "since the gluon density is rapidly falling in the range of larger values of @xmath0 , the latter reaction yields only a small contribution to the cross section for large leptoquark masses .",
    "both processes contain a collinear singularity in the limit @xmath76 , which has to be regulated for the inclusive cross section .",
    "for the differential distributions a lower cut on @xmath77 is applied .",
    "a part of these events would show an apparent two - jet signature , with one jet at a mass of @xmath40 .",
    "since the leptoquark and the final state parton are balanced in @xmath77 , the electron is more difficult to isolate from the hadronic fragments of the leptoquark both kinematically , and possibly also due to @xmath78 mesons contained in the jet . for scalar leptoquark production",

    "the total pair production cross section is shown for scalar leptoquarks using the cteq3 ( lo ) parametrization  @xcite for the parton densities .",
    "for @xmath101 the scalar pair production cross section amounts to @xmath102 , taking @xmath103 both as the factorization and renormalization scale .",
    "other choices as @xmath104 lead to a cross section which is larger by a factor of @xmath105 for @xmath36 , showing the scale dependence in lowest order .",
    "the pair production cross section for vector leptoquarks depends sizeably on the anomalous couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the vector leptoquarks to the gluon , see figure  1 .",
    "if the coupling would be of the yang  mills type , i.e. @xmath106 , the event rate could reach about 1000 events for @xmath36 at each tevatron experiment . even in the case of the minimal vector coupling , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ,",
    "the rate amounts to 100 events .",
    "both these cases are likely to be excluded due to the event rates measured at the tevatron experiments .",
    "however , since a prediction on the vector couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 does not exist , a global limit can only be derived minimizing the integrated cross section for these parameters . for a mass of @xmath36 one obtains @xmath109 for events with a @xmath110 final state assuming @xmath111 . for @xmath112 @xmath113",
    "is obtained .",
    "the corresponding anomalous couplings are @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "these leading order estimates show that the pair production process of leptoquarks may yield up to 10 .. 16 signal events at an integrated luminosity of @xmath116 for scalar leptoquarks and , in the presence of only the two anomalous couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for vector leptoquarks at the minimal cross section , up to 20 .. 30 events , depending on the value of the factorization and renormalization scale   k - factor both for scalar and vector leptoquark pair production is not yet available . ] and the yet unknown branching ratios .",
    "the detection of the @xmath110 final state is complicated due to different background reactions , see e.g.  @xcite , which can only be reliably studied by the experiments themselves . given the uncertainty in the branching fraction @xmath117 , both scalar and vector leptoquarks seem to be not yet excluded by the tevatron data .",
    "on the basis of the present statistics bounds on the anomalous couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 for vector leptoquarks can be derived up to masses of @xmath118 .",
    "an interpretation of the recently reported excess of events in the range of high @xmath0 and @xmath1 at hera in terms of single leptoquark production yields leptoquark - fermion couplings , @xmath119 , which are compatible with other limits , particularly those obtained from low energy reactions , for @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "still more statistics is needed to clearly establish an effect .    if the observed excess of events is due to leptoquarks , these states should as well be detected in the reaction channel @xmath122 at hera at an increased integrated luminosity .",
    "the measurement of this reaction allows to investigate the coupling of the state @xmath123 to gluons and provides an independent possibility to determine its spin",
    ".    the fermilab experiments , at a higher statistics , will be able to either clearly confirm or exclude the interpretation of the current excess of events found at hera as being due to leptoquark production . for vector leptoquarks already at the current statistics bounds on the range of the couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be derived .",
    "it is likely that both yang - mills type and minimal couplings of the leptoquarks to the gluon are already exluded by the observed event rates .",
    "on the other hand the tevatron data do not exclude scalar and vector leptoquarks , for some range in @xmath25 and @xmath26 , at a mass @xmath36 .",
    "the search for leptoquark pair production at tevatron is complementary to the search for single leptoquark production at hera both due to the couplings involved in the production mechanism , as well as with respect to the alternative possibility to investigate the spin of the produced state in case of a confirmation of the effect",
