    "several proofs suggest that soft @xmath9-ray repeaters(sgrs ) , and perhaps the so - called anomalous x - ray pulsars(axps ) , are neutron stars with magnetic fields @xmath10gthe so called magnetars@xcite .",

    "a considerable amount of studies have been devoted to the structure of the magnetic field outside the neutron star , in the so - called magnetosphere , in relation with the pulsar emission mechanism(for a review , see e.g.@xcite ) .",

    "the eos is altered by both the landau quantization of the charged particles(such as protons , electrons , etc.)and the interactions of the magnetic moments , including the anomalous magnetic moments of the neutral particles(such as the neutron , strangness - bearing @xmath17-hyperon etc . ) , with the magnetic field . + we study the properties of n - p - e neutron star by incorporating the magnetic field with the relativistic @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 model . in other works , the pressure is usually studied by thermodynamics .",
