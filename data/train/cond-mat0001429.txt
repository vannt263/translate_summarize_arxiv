    "the density - functional theory ( dft),@xcite with its local - density ( lda)@xcite and semilocal generalized - gradient approximations ( gga),@xcite is not only successful in numerous applications to individual molecules and dense solids .",
    "it is also under intense development , for instance , in order to include non - local effects , such as van der waals ( vdw ) forces.@xcite the latter are needed in order to allow dft to describe sparse matter .",
    "a unified treatment of vdw forces at large and asymptotic molecular separations is available,@xcite and a description at short distances and at overlap is striven for .",
    "an accurate calculation for the interaction of two he atoms has been given,@xcite and recently the first microscopic ( rpa ) calculation of the vdw interaction between two self - consistent jellium slabs has been reported and given a density functional ( df ) account.@xcite the ultimate challenge is to construct an approximate vdw df that is generally applicable , efficient , and accurate .",
    "we here propose an explicit form for the vdw df that applies to flat surfaces , test it successfully against these slab results , and apply it to two parallel flat semi - infinite metal surfaces .",
    "this is a case with relevance for many physical situations , including wetting and atomic - force microscopy ( afm ) .",
    "compared to the vdw - df approximation proposed by dobson and wang,@xcite the virtues of our functional are the computational simplifications gained from choosing a particular sub - class of response functions , utilizing a differential formulation and sparse matrices , and recognizing the insensitivity to the details of the density profiles , simplifications which might transfer even to three dimensions .",
    "the ubiquitous van der waals force plays an important role for numerous physical , chemical , and biological systems , such as physisorption,@xcite vdw complexes,@xcite vdw bonds in crystals , liquids , adhesion , and soft condensed matter ( e.g. , biomacromolecules , biosurfaces , polymers , and membranes).@xcite    the dft expresses the ground - state energy of an interacting system in an external potential @xmath1 as a functional @xmath2 $ ] of the particle density @xmath3 , which has its minimum at the true ground - state density.@xcite the kohn - sham form of the functional makes the scheme a tractable one , as it leads to equations of one - electron type , and accounts for the intricate interactions among the electrons with an exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional @xmath4$].@xcite this xc - energy functional can be expressed exactly as an integral over a coupling constant ( @xmath5),@xcite the so - called adiabatic connection formula ( acf ) , @xmath6 } - e_{\\rm self},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and where the density - density correlation function is denoted by @xmath8.@xcite @xmath9 is the coulomb self - energy of all electrons , which is exactly cancelled by a corresponding term in @xmath10 .",

    "the lda and gga are completely unable to express the vdw interaction in a physically sound way .",
    "the exact xc energy functional , on the other hand , of course encompasses such interactions.@xcite the basic problem of making dft a working application tool also for sparse matter is to express the truly non - local vdw interactions between the electrons in the form of a simple , physical , and tractable df .",
    "equation ( [ eq : xacf ] ) is then the starting point . along these lines , we have proposed extensions of the dft to include van der waals interactions,@xcite with very promising results for the interaction between two atoms or molecules , an atom and a surface , and two parallel surfaces , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : xacf ] ) is the computational complexity .",
    "a direct solution gives simply too many operations on the computer .",

    "let us suppose that @xmath66 varies only in the interval @xmath67 ( which will eventually be extended to infinity ) and takes the same value at either end point .",

    "there is a peak in @xmath91 , the plasmon peak , sharp in the ideal electron gas and of varying width in real materials .",
    "this peak carries most of the spectral strength and has @xmath92 equal to the plasma frequency @xmath93 as @xmath94 , and then a dispersion with a limiting behavior @xmath95 , the kinetic energy of one electron , in the impulse - approximation , valid in the compton - scattering limit , @xmath96 . in the electron - plasmon coupling one",

    "i.e. _ @xmath29 is described in a plasmon - pole approximation.@xcite a dispersion law like @xmath97 has been shown to efficiently account for the average behavior of plasmon - like excitations and for correlation properties of the homogeneous electron gas.@xcite introducing the electron density via @xmath98 and @xmath99 in hartree units , @xmath100 being the electron density profile in this planar case , the dielectric function can be written as @xmath101 where the imaginary frequency @xmath102 is introduced .",
    "alternatively , eq .  ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) may be viewed as an interpolation between the exact small- and large-@xmath103 behavior of the lindhard expression for the frequency - dependent dielectric function .",

    "it is thus taken to be local not only in this sense , but in the additional sense that it is a function only of the local density . to compensate",

    "such a length scale should be associated with intrinsic electron - gas parameters like the screening length or the extent of the correlation hole .",
    "there are of course several choices available",
    ". it must be kept in mind that we are after long range surface properties in a variety of environments .",
    "these properties are determined by various response functions introduced by feibelman,@xcite of which the simplest , @xmath108 is the centroid of induced charge when a uniform electric field is applied perpendicularly to the surface .",

    "the main difference in cases such as this one , where two infinite bodies are involved , is that terms involving multiple reflections no longer vanish in the asymptotic limit , and should be explicitly included as indicated by the @xmath122 term in eq .",

    "here we show how ratios of determinants like eq .",

    "( [ eq : phidef ] ) .",
    "specifically we take @xmath46 points between @xmath69 and @xmath146 ( for the full determinant ) , @xmath147 points between @xmath69 and @xmath52 ( for subsystem determinants ) , so that @xmath148 , with the spacing between points @xmath149 .",
    "we use a similar representation for the empty space operator @xmath150 .",
    "thus , replacing the subsystem determinant @xmath68 by the discretisized @xmath151 , we have @xmath152 where @xmath153 along with a similar relation for the empty space determinant @xmath154 . being tridiagonal , the determinant can be evaluated in @xmath47 time , as contrasted to the @xmath45 time applicable for a general determinant .",
    "the determinant is readily expanded by minors , giving the recursion formula @xmath155 with @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "it is clear from ( [ eq : phidiscrete ] ) and ( [ eq : abcdef ] ) that @xmath151 oscillates in sign from order to order , an oscillation that is cancelled in the ratio eq .",
    "( [ eq : tridag ] ) by a similar oscillation in @xmath63 .",
    "however , the envelope determinant @xmath158 satisfies a simple differential equation in the continuum limit . to make the exact form of this differential equation identical to eq .",
