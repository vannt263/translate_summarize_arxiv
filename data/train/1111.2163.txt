    "all these structures are embedded in the vela supernova remnant , which has a radius of @xmath04@xmath4 .",
    "the cocoon is ascribed to an asymmetric reverse shock , which stripped the bulk of the particles from around the pulsar leaving a relic pwn  @xcite .",
    "this explanation has been confirmed by the detection of extended tev emission matching the cocoon @xcite , with the brightness peak offset from the pulsar , and of thermal x - ray emission suggesting mixing with the shocked ejecta @xcite .",

    "the angular resolution of ibis / isgri on board the _ integral _  observatory @xcite combined with its large field of view allows for the first time to address the problem of the full morphology of the hard x - ray nebula . here",
    "we report on the _ integral _  identification of extended hard x - ray emission from vela .",
    "we analyzed all public _ integral _  pointings within 12@xmath5 from the vela pulsar .",

    "a joint fit to the ibis / isgri and spi spectra with a single power law yields a compatible photon index , but it requires a renormalization constant of 1.8 to recover the higher spi flux .",

    "[ fig:3 ] , the ibis / isgri , beppo__sax__/pds , and spi fluxes correlate with the respective psf radii ( hwhm : 6 , 39 , and 1.3@xmath3 ) , suggesting that each instrument samples a different portion of the nebula .",
    "due to the coded mask deconvolution of ibis / isgri , optimized for point sources , the reconstructed flux of an extended source of 60  radius is lower than the real one by a factor @xmath050 @xcite .",
    "therefore , a flux of @xmath14  ( the difference between the spi and isgri fluxes ) from such a source would be measured as low as @xmath010@xmath15  by ibis / isgri , close to its sensitivity limit .    to support the hypothesis that an extended source is present in the ibis / isgri data but diluted by the coded mask deconvolution , we refined the analysis following the method developed by @xcite for analyzing emission from extended sources .",
    "we extracted the ibis / isgri count rates from concentric circles centered on the pulsar with radii up to 80 , and converted them into flux by assuming a photon index as for the point - like source .",
    "this integrated flux as a function of the extraction radius does not reach a plateau after 15 , as expected for a point - like source , but slowly increases up to @xmath060  ( fig .",

    "thanks to the deep _ integral _  exposure , we were able to discover diffuse emission above 20 kev beyond the inner vela pwn .",
    "such emission is resolved in two different regions : a southern hot - spot coincident with the vela cocoon , notably with the peak of the tev brightness profile measured by _",
    "_ , and a more extended northern emission , without any counterpart at other wavelengths and outside vela x. however , recent _",
    "suzaku_/xis observations showed non - thermal emission below 10 kev in a region located at the boundary of the ibis northern emission @xcite .",
    "we then compared the ibis spectrum to the ones of beppo__sax__/pds and spi , and explained the flux differences by their different psfs , which sample different portions of the nebula , confirming a large extension ( @xmath01@xmath3  radius ) at hard x - rays .",
    "we also reported on the spectrum within 6  from the pulsar using the ibis / isgri and the xis telescopes .",
    "this is the first broad - band x - ray spectrum of the vela pwn  taken within a region with the same angular extension below and above 10 kev .",
    "the change of slope around 25 kev ( @xmath31 for the band model ) is compatible with the standard value of 0.5 expected from a cooling break occurring in a continuously injected electron distribution affected by radiative losses .",
    "indeed , the xis and ibis / isgri photon indices ( @xmath01.6 and @xmath02.2 ) are compatible with the synchrotron spectrum of a shock - accelerated electron distribution in the uncooled and cooled regime , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this framework",
    ", the cooling energy is expected to decrease with time , that is at increasing integration radii from the pulsar . the lower break energy measured by beppo__sax _",
    "_  mecs and pds on a larger angular extension may indicate a cooling break propagating along the flow .",
    "indeed , the cooling energy in the cocoon is expected around 1 kev @xcite .",
    "the similar photon indices found by ibis , beppo__sax__/pds , and spi suggest that the radiative losses above 20 kev already balance the injection rate within the region enclosed by the ibis / isgri psf .",
    "the measurement of a cooling energy at @xmath025 kev in the photon spectrum allows us to set an upper limit on the time ( residence time ) spent by the particles in the region within 6  from the pulsar , corresponding to a distance of 0.5 @xmath32 pc .",
    "accounting for synchrotron losses and inverse compton losses in the thomson regime , the cooling frequency as a function of the residence time @xmath33 can be written @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the photon field and magnetic energy densities , respectively .",
    "( [ eq : coolingfrequency ] ) coincides with the cooling frequency calculated assuming only synchrotron losses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath37 . solving it for @xmath33 , the residence time has a maximum occurring for a magnetic field @xmath38 independently from the cooling frequency .",
    "such a magnetic field amounts to 1.9 @xmath1 g when the target photons are provided by the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb , @xmath39 ev @xmath40 ) . for a cooling energy of 25 kev ( @xmath41 hz ) ,",
    "the residence time of electrons is 1650 yr in this case , and shorter for any different intensity of the magnetic field and any additional photon field .",
    "therefore , the electrons radiating in x - rays in the considered region can not be older than 1650 yr .",
    "we conclude that those injected before have flowed out of the region within 6  from the pulsar .",
    "this requires a moderate average velocity ( @xmath42 km / s ) .",
    "we explored the hypothesis that particles of all energies remain in this region for the residence time which yields a cooling break at 25 kev for a given @xmath43 .",
    "this is done by means of a time - dependent one - zone model of the spectral energy distribution ( s.e.d .",
    ", see fig . [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the injection spectrum is composed by a relativistic maxwellian @xcite and a cut - off power law with index 2.2 .",
    "the radiative losses depend on a magnetic field of constant intensity @xmath43 and a target photon field taken at the vela position according to @xcite .",
    "the cut - off energy is fixed by @xmath43 through the condition that the acceleration rate equals the cooling rate @xcite .",
    "the shape of the distribution is constant , whereas the normalization is proportional to the pulsar spin - down power : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fraction of @xmath46 converted into the wind energy , and @xmath47 is the average lorentz factor fixed by the energy conservation .",
    "such an injection rate decreases in time following @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the initial spin - down power , @xmath50 the spin - down time - scale , and @xmath51 for a braking index @xmath52 @xcite .    the s.e.d . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] is reproduced by this simple model for a range of values of @xmath43 .",
    "the upper limit on the integral flux above 1 tev implies a firm lower limit on the magnetic field , @xmath53 g , higher than the one estimated in the cocoon @xcite .",
    "this result depends on the relative intensity of the synchrotron and compton peaks , which is not affected by the conversion efficiency @xmath45 ( 1.3% for @xmath54 g ) .",
    "it is also nearly irrespective of @xmath50 and @xmath52 : given the short evolution time , a manifold break around the cooling energy due to the pulsar spin - down @xcite is not evident between 100 yr and 1000 yr , and both @xmath55 ( dipolar rotator model ) and @xmath56 ( measured , * ? ? ?",

    "the extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum at lower energies falls squarely on the measured radio fluxes of the compact pwn .",
    "a fine tuning is obtained adopting a relativistic maxwellian with a temperature of 3 gev for @xmath54 g ; alternatively , a low - energy break in the injected electron population is required at gev energies , as found in young pwne  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "additional measurements between radio and x - ray frequencies are needed to exclude a more complex spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that diffuse hard x - ray emission is detected beyond 6  from the pulsar in the northern direction strengthens the hypothesis of particle leakage . unlike the southern hot - spot , which may simply be the high - energy counterpart of the x - ray cocoon",
