    "to characterize the nature of correlations in a quantum system , and in particular quantifying their quantum and classical parts , is of both fundamental and practical interest .",
    "in fact , in certain computational tasks with mixed quantum states quantum speed - up can be achieved using separable ( unentangled ) states , like in the so - called deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) protocol @xcite .",
    "this speed - up has been linked @xcite to the presence of quantum discord @xcite , that quantifies quantum correlations in a bipartite system and was originally defined as the difference between two alternative quantum versions of two classically equivalent expressions of mutual information .",
    "quantum correlations have otherwise been quantified exploiting the idea that the distance between a given state of the system and its closest state without the desired property ( e.g. , quantum correlations ) quantifies that property .",
    "the distance is defined by the relative entropy between states and the discord is thus defined as the distance between the system state @xmath0 and its closest classical state @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the relative - entropy - based ( reb ) definition of quantum discord does not in general coincide with the original definition of quantum discord but it is connected to the latter by a quantity measuring the distance between two states linked to the state @xmath0 @xcite . within this approach",
    "classical correlations have been then characterized by the distance between the classical state @xmath1 and its closest product state @xmath2 while total correlation by the distance between the system state @xmath0 and its closest product state @xmath3 .",
    "the reb quantifiers of correlations ( quantum or classical ) present the advantage of not being limited , as was the case for the original definition of quantum discord , to bipartite quantum systems but have the drawback that their analytical expressions are known only for certain classes of states @xcite and require in general considerable numerical minimizations .",
    "thus , a more manageable quantifier of quantum correlations , named geometric quantum discord , has been defined as the hilbert - schmidt ( square norm ) distance between the system state and its closest classical state @xcite .",
    "when one studies evolutions of quantum correlations in a two - qubit system locally affected by non - dissipative channels , reb quantum discord may exhibit plateaux during its evolution @xcite ; differently , in correspondence of these plateaux , geometric quantum discord does not remain constant @xcite .",
    "these qualitative differences emerge also when the closest classical states entering the two distance measures are the same @xcite .",
    "these findings may be related to the known result in the theory of entanglement that different entanglement measures induce different orderings in the state space @xcite .",
    "reb and geometric discord have been compared in the state space for two - qubit states and it has been shown that inequivalent ordering also occurs @xcite . moreover , an analysis in the state space has recently shown that geometric quantifiers of total , classical and quantum correlations do not satisfy in general closed additivity relations , that instead hold for the entropic quantifiers @xcite .",

    "a more manageable distance measure between states is the hilbert - schmidt ( square - norm ) distance , by which the geometric quantum discord has been defined as @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath1 is the classical state closest to @xmath0 .",
