    "in spite of the considerable efforts to explain the experimental raman spectra of cuprate superconductors , the @xmath0 superconducting response is not yet completely understood . it has been shown that the theoretical description of the @xmath0 raman response was very sensitive to small changes in the raman vertex harmonic representations , yielding peak positions varying between @xmath1 and 2@xmath1 @xcite . however , the data show peaks consistently slightly above @xmath1 for both ybco and bscco .    in this paper we present calculations suggesting that the @xmath0 peak position is largely controlled by a collective spin fluctuation ( sf ) mode near 41 mev , consistent with inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) observations @xcite .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 response is strongly modified by the sf term and is not sensitive to small changes in the raman vertex .",
    "the experimental peak position is well reproduced by our model whereas the @xmath2 and @xmath3 response remain essentially unaffected by the sf mode .",
    "the cuo@xmath4 bilayer is modeled by a tight binding band structure with a nearest ( @xmath5 ) and a next nearest neighbor hopping ( @xmath6 ) parameter and an inter - plane hopping given by @xcite @xmath7 ^ 2 .\\ ] ] @xmath8 can be 0 or @xmath9 , for bonding or anti - bonding bands of the bilayer , respectively .",
    "the spin susceptibility ( @xmath10 ) is modeled by extending the weak coupling form of a @xmath11 superconductor to include antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations by an rpa form with an effective interaction @xmath12 ; i.e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the simple bubble in the d - wave state .",
    "this form of the spin susceptibility is motivated by the fact that it contains a strong magnetic resonance peak at @xmath15 which was proposed @xcite to explain the ins resonance at energies near 41 mev in ybco @xcite and bscco @xcite .",
    "the raman response function in the superconducting state is evaluated using nambu green s functions .",
    "the spin fluctuations contribute to the raman response via a 2-magnon process as shown in fig .",
    "[ total ] @xcite where a schematic representation of the feynman diagrams of the sf and the bubble contribution is plotted . for the electronic propagators",
    "we have used the bare bcs green s functions and a d - wave superconducting gap @xmath16/2 $ ] .",
    "the total raman response is calculated in the gauge invariant form which results from taking into account the long wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "the total raman susceptibility is thus given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is determined according to fig .",
    "[ total ] . the analytical continuation to the real axis",
    "is performed using pad approximants .",
    "we have used several different forms for the raman vertex @xmath19 which possess the correct transformation properties required by symmetry .",
    "our calculations show that the sf term yields vanishingly small corrections to the response in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 channels , but contributes substantially to the @xmath0 channel .",
    "the shape of the total response in the @xmath0 geometry is mainly dependent on the value of the effective interaction @xmath12 .",
    "variations of @xmath12 change the relative magnitude of the two diagrams summed in fig .",
    "[ total ] , changing the position of the peak in @xmath0 geometry .",
    "importantly , we find that the @xmath0 response shows little dependence on the form used for the vertex : @xmath20 , or the vertex calculated in an effective mass approximation .",
    "these results can be explained by symmetry reasons given that the sf propagator is strongly peaked for @xmath21 momentum transfers .",
    "we compare the calculated raman response with the experimental spectra of an optimally doped bi-2212 sample @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] . adding the sf contribution leads to a shift of the peak position from near @xmath22 for @xmath23 to higher frequencies , allowing a better agreement with the experimental relative positions of the peaks in @xmath0 and @xmath2 geometries . for the fit we have adjusted @xmath5 to achieve a good agreement with the @xmath2 channel , obtaining @xmath24 mev , and then adjusted @xmath12 to match both the @xmath0 peak position as well as the peak in the sf propagator to be consistent with the ins peak at 41 mev .      from this work",
    "we conclude that including the sf contribution in the raman response solves the previously unexplained sensitivity of the @xmath0 response to small changes in the raman vertex .",
    "whereas the sf ( two - magnon ) contribution controls the @xmath0 peak , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering geometries are essentially unaffected and determined by the bare bubble alone .      9 t.p .",
