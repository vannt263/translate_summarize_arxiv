    "in the family of ferroelectrics a large group of mixed and disordered `` relaxors '' has been identified including perovskites @xmath2 ( pmn ) , @xmath3 ( pst ) , la - modified @xmath4 ( plzt ) , tungsten - bronze structure oxides like @xmath5 ( pbn ) , etc.@xcite due to the effect of configurational disorder the properties of relaxor ferroelectrics are very different from those in translationally invariant ferroelectrics . among the unusual properties of these materials",
    "are a ) the coexistence of slow kinetics typical for spin glasses with a very large dielectric constant indicating intermideate range polar order on the nanometer length scale which can be transformed to true long range order , ( _ i.e. _ , to macroscopic polarization and strain ) by a suitable change of the composition or by applying an external electric field ; b ) the existence of a frequency dependent slim hysteresis loop even above the transition temperature ; c ) the difference between field - cooled and zero field - cooled dielectric susceptibility , etc .",
    "all these findings indicate that the observed properties of relaxor ferroelectrics are nonequilibrium properties .",
    "relaxor ferroelectrics thus represent a new low temperature state of polar dielectrics compared with conventional ferroelectrics .",
    "experiments show that there is symmetry breaking on a nanometer scale as observed from raman scattering@xcite and x - ray and neutron diffraction@xcite .",
    "this observation implies that polar clusters exist even well above @xmath0 and the observed properties of relaxors are strongly affected by the reorientations of the clusters .",
    "in particular , cluster reorientation in the applied electric field induces strong polar - strain coupling which makes relaxor ferroelectrics the candidate materials for the next generation of ultrasonic transducers@xcite .",
    "it has been proposed@xcite , in analogy with the cluster model of spin glasses , that the polar clusters behave like large superparaelectric dipole moments .",
    "the broad distribution of relaxation times for cluster orientations originates from the distribution of the potential barriers separating different orientational states .",
    "the superparaelectric model@xcite based on the assumption of independent clusters can not explain , however , the appearance of long range order with the change of the material composition or due to an applied external field . the appearance of long range order also can not be explained by the inclusion of frustrated interactions between superparaelectric moments@xcite that lead to the dipole spin glass state .",
    "an alternative proposition@xcite relates the origin of relaxor behavior to the domain states induced by the static random field caused , for example , by charged composition fluctuations .",
    "although this model seems very attractive , it encounters difficulties in explaining the observed cluster dynamics in the high temperature phase .",
    "we will show that the proposed model is capable to describe the anomalies of dielectric response of relaxor ferroelectrics and can be applied for systems possessing first or second order phase transitions or remaining only incipient ferroelectrics with very high dielectric constant and vanishing spontaneous polarization .",
    "the origin of polar clusters in relaxor ferroelectrics is still not understood .",
    "it has been proposed@xcite that off - center ions might be responsible for relaxor properties in analogy with @xmath6 ( klt ) where @xmath7 impurity ions occupy the off - center positions near the vacant @xmath8 sites .",
    "it is well established@xcite that in the case of impurity induced relaxors like klt the single impurity potential possesses multi - well structure which allows the thermal jumps of off - center ions between different potential minima . in contrast ,",
    "in disordered complex perovskites the displacement of atoms from their centro - symmetrical positions is caused apparently by the charge compositional fluctuations , which violate the charge balance within the adjacent unit cells and lead to the additional electrostatic forces on the atoms .",
    "in this situation one would not expect that the single atom potential energy possesses multi - minima structure .",
    "atom reorientations would more probably take place if they associate with the collective motion of atoms within small clusters , ( _ i.e. _ , the cluster potential energy is characterized by the multi - well ( double well ) structure ) .",
    "such a picture is analogous to the situation in glasses where the origin of two level systems responsible for glass anomalies is associated with the double well potentials@xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that the existence of the double well potentials is due to the disorder in glasses , so that local rearrangements of atoms might switch the system between two adjacent local energy minima .",
    "attempts to detect double well potentials in computer simulations@xcite based on the assumption of the motion of single atoms@xcite have been unsuccessful .",
    "instead the origin of double well potentials in glasses has been successfully explained@xcite in terms of collective motion of atoms within small clusters .    in this paper",
    "we develop further the cluster model of relaxor ferroelectrics taking explicitly into account a ) the broad distribution of local field experienced by each cluster due to cluster - cluster interaction and b ) the broad distribution of potential barriers controlling cluster dynamics .",
    "we will show that the proposed model is capable of describing the anomalies of dielectric response of relaxor ferroelectrics and can be applied for systems possessing first or second order phase transitions or remaining an incipient ferroelectrics with very high dielectric constant and vanishing spontaneous polarization .",
    "based on the analogy between disorder induced double well potentials in glasses and disordered relaxor ferroelectrics we will adopt the following picture of the cluster dynamics in relaxor ferroelectrics .",
    "each minimum in a double well potential for a given cluster is characterized by the cluster dipole moment or cluster polarization @xmath9 .",
    "the potential barrier between different minima determines the atom hopping frequency @xmath10 .",
    "clusters interact with each other , and interacting reorientable polarizable clusters should increase the crystal dielectric response .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the experiment@xcite in pst where the effect of disorder in the relative occupation of b sites by sc or ta atoms dramatically increases the dielectric constant .",
    "time or frequency dependent dielectric response can be analyzed with the use of the master equation @xmath11 well known from the theory of ferroelectrics of order - disorder type@xcite , describing the relaxation of the polarization of each cluster to its quasi - equilibrium value @xmath12 which depends on the value of the local field @xmath13 induced by other clusters at any moment of time . in general",
    "the local field @xmath13 is a time dependent random field .",
    "it also includes the contribution from the applied field @xmath14 and the contribution from the static random fields caused by the material imperfections .    in order to apply eq.([eq : a7 ] ) to relaxor ferroelectrics one should perform the average over the distribution of relaxation times @xmath15 and the distribution of the local fields @xmath13 . for this purpose",
    "we rewrite eq.([eq : a7 ] ) in the equivalent integral form and take the average with respect to @xmath16 and the initial cluster polarization @xmath17 to obtain @xmath18    the function @xmath19 , where the overbar denotes the average over the relaxation time @xmath15 , characterizes the slow nonexponential kinetics of the system . in addition    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the distribution function of the local field which depends parametrically on the value of the average polarization of the system @xmath22 .",
    "we will consider below @xmath23 in the form @xmath24 .",
    "this form of @xmath25 is consistent with the mean field approximation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the delta - function and @xmath28 is the local field phenomenological parameter . in disordered systems",
    "the effect of composition fluctuations leads to a deviation from the simple mean field picture that can be taken into account by the replacement of the @xmath27-function by the function @xmath29 with finite width .",
    "the shape and the width of @xmath30 depend on the explicit form of the cluster - cluster interactions as well as on static random fields caused by the material imperfections .",
    "the value @xmath31 is the local field induced by the external field in the dielectric media with the dielectric constant @xmath32 @xcite ( _ i.e. , _ we assume that the polar clusters are distributed in a highly polarizable dielectric media ) . in relaxor ferroelectrics which are mainly perovskite - based highly polarizable materials ,",
    "the typical values are @xmath33 .",
    "eq.([eq : a9 ] ) can be applied for the analysis of different experimental situations ( _ e.g. , _ decay of the polarization , the difference between field - cooled and zero field - cooled dielectric susceptibility , the effect of a frequency dependent hysteresis loop , etc ) . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate , for illustration , on the calculation of the frequency dependent linear dielectric susceptibility . in order to calculate the steady state susceptibility in the presence of an additional time independent field @xmath34 we write @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the time independent polarization induced by the field @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 , we denote @xmath37 as the spontaneous polarization ) .",
    "we obtain from eq.([eq : a9 ] ) the following self consistent equation for @xmath37    @xmath40    assuming @xmath41 in eq.([eq : a9 ] ) , considering a linear expansion of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and taking laplace transform of eq.([eq : a9 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath45    where we used the definition of the dielectric constant @xmath46 . in eq.([eq : a19 ] )    @xmath47    and @xmath48 is the laplace transform of @xmath49 given by    @xmath50    assuming an arrhenius or vogel - fulcher ( vf ) law for @xmath15    @xmath51 } , \\label{eq : a4}\\ ] ]    we may calculate @xmath52 .",
    "thus , we obtain for @xmath53@xcite    @xmath54    where g(u ) is the distribution function of the potential barriers .    in the spirit of landau phenomenological",
    "theory one can further expand the right hand side of eqs.([eq : a17 ] ) and ( [ eq : a20 ] ) in a power series with respect to @xmath37 assuming that the applied field is sufficiently small , and present @xmath55 as    @xmath56    eqs.([eq : a19 ] ) , ( [ eq : a5 ] ) , and ( [ eq : a25 ] ) give the phenomenological description of the dynamical response of relaxor ferroelectrics and can be applied for systems possessing first or second order phase transitions or remaining as only incipient ferroelectrics with very high dielectric constant and vanishing spontaneous polarization .",
    "in this section we illustrate a capability of the model in the description of the dielectric response of relaxor ferroelectrics .",
    "_ relaxors with incipient ferroelectric order_. in order to simultaneously reproduce the high values of the dielectric constant in relaxor ferroelectrics and the absence of spontaneous polarization ( like that in pmn or pst with vacancies ) one should assume that @xmath57 and @xmath58 remaining , however , less than 1 at all temperatures .",
    "we chose for the illustrative calculations @xmath59 ( which , according to eq.([eq : a19 ] ) , reproduces curie - like high temperature behavior of @xmath60 and its high saturation value at low temperatures ) and @xmath61 .",
    "we assume also the arrhenius temperature dependence of @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 in eq.([eq : a4 ] ) . using the chosen values of @xmath64 , and @xmath65 we calculated the dielectric permittivity @xmath66 as a function of temperature for different values of @xmath67 .",
    "the calculated real part of permittivity is shown in fig.1 note that the frequency dependent maximum of @xmath68 is not just a relaxation maximum .",
    "it originates from the competitive temperature dependences of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the behavior obtained for @xmath68 is in reasonable qualitative agreement with the experiment@xcite . for a more detailed comparison with the experiment one needs to find the functions @xmath52 and @xmath70 corresponding to the best fit with the experimental data .    _ manifestation of the first order phase transition_. in some relaxor ferroelectrics ( e.g. , disordered pst or klt above the critical concentration of li ions )",
    "there is evidence of a first order phase transition , which manifests itself in the sharp drop of the dielectric constant at the temperature below the position of the relaxation maximum .",
    "in order to reproduce this behavior within the proposed phenomenological theory one should assume @xmath71 .",
    "for example for @xmath72 and the values of @xmath70 and @xmath73 being the same as used above , the first order phase transition occurs at @xmath74 ( in the chosen dimensionless units ) .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath68 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "a remarkable feature of the @xmath68 temperature dependence is that the relaxation maximum of @xmath68 approaches the phase transition temperature with a decrease of the frequency until it finally disappears transforming to a sharp peak like that in conventional ferroelectrics .",
    "this behavior is in qualitative agreement with that observed in pst .",
    "_ reconstruction of the relaxation function @xmath52_. pst with b - site chemical disorder undergoes a first order relaxor - ferroelectric phase transition at @xmath75@xcite .",
    "the dielectric permittivity of pst shows pronounced frequency dispersion with the position of a frequency dependent maximum obeying the vf law@xcite @xmath76 $ ] , where @xmath77 is the frequency of the applied field and @xmath78 is the temperature of the permittivity maximum corresponding to the frequency @xmath77 .",
    "it has been widely accepted ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the vf type relation for the permittivity maximum is a consequence of the vf law ( [ eq : a4 ] ) for @xmath62 .",
    "this assumption has been argued recently by tagantsev @xcite who proposed that the observation in pst of the vf frequency dependence of @xmath78 can be explained with the use of the arrhenius temperature dependence of @xmath15 taking into account the existence of the first order phase transition and the fact that in pst @xmath79 . an important conclusion of tagantsev s analysis is the indication that @xmath78 might be influenced significantly by the values of static permittivity , not only by the specific temperature dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "however , in order to be more conclusive one should analyze the shape of the frequency dependent permittivity as a function of temperature for different frequencies , not just the frequency dependence of the permittivity maximum .",
    "such an analysis is given below with the use of eq.([eq : a19 ] ) .",
    "first , we extrapolated the experimental data@xcite and extracted the static permittivity above @xmath0 as shown in fig.3 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "then , using eq.([eq : a19 ] ) and the fact that at @xmath80 is equal to 1 , we obtained the values of @xmath81 above @xmath0 .",
    "we used the value @xmath82 for the host lattice permittivity based on the experimental low temperature values of @xmath83 where the polar clusters are frozen . with the values obtained for @xmath81 and the experimental values of the frequency dependent permittivity @xmath84 at frequency @xmath85 ( curve 1 ) we have calculated the values of @xmath86 using eq.([eq : a19 ] ) .",
    "according to eq.([eq : a5 ] ) @xmath87 is a function of @xmath88 that results in the scaling relation @xmath89 with @xmath90 . using this relation one can reconstruct the values of @xmath91 at other frequencies and , therefore , the values of @xmath92",
    ". the results of such a reconstruction are presented in fig.3 for the upper 100hz ( curve 2 ) and lower 1mhz ( curve 3 ) boundary frequencies used in the experiment .",
    "we used @xmath93 in accordance with ref.@xcite .",
    "one can see from fig.3 that the approach reproduces rather well the shape of the temperature dependence of the permittivity at different frequencies of the applied field .",
    "the parameter of the fit @xmath65 is found to be @xmath94 which is in reasonable agreement with the value @xmath95 estimated in ref.@xcite .",
    "this result means that the employment of the vf law for @xmath62 is very crucial for obtaining the correct temperature and frequency dependence of the permittivity for pst .",
    "the vf relation for @xmath62 results simultaneously in the very fast temperature dependence of the permittivity and its rather slow dependence on @xmath96 , observed in the experiment . at the same time",
    "an arrhenius like dependence of @xmath62 would result in an extremely rapid dependence of the permittivity on @xmath97 , which is inconsistent with the experimental data ."
