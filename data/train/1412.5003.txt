    "the heavy quarks produced in the early stage of relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) is one of the crucial probes to the medium formed at later stage of the collision , known as quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "matsui and satz  @xcite first proposed the idea of debye screening of the potential between a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark , which causes the suppression of the yields of heavy quarkonium states in hic  @xcite . since then many efforts have been devoted to understand the change of properties of @xmath3 states in the deconfined medium , using either the non - relativistic calculations based upon some effective ( screened ) potential @xcite or the lattice calculations of quarkonium spectral functions @xcite .",
    "potential models provide a simple and intuitive framework for the study of quarkonium properties at finite temperature but the main problem is the determination of the effective potential . at zero temperature ,",
    "the use of effective potentials and their connection to the underlying field theory is well established but at finite temperature the issue is still open @xcite .",
    "different potential models based upon the lattice free and internal energies have a fair agreement with the results from the lattice studies @xcite whereas the calculations of euclidean correlators using a variety of potential models were not able to reproduce the temperature dependence of the lattice correlators @xcite .",
    "it was not until recently that effective field theory ( eft ) approaches have been developed to justify the use of potential models at finite temperature because the eft techniques are suited for handling systems with well separated energy scales .",
    "two types of scales appear _ viz .",
    "_ at t=0 : the mass of the heavy quark , @xmath4 , the typical momentum transfer ( @xmath5 , and the binding energy ( @xmath6 ) , and at @xmath7 : the temperature @xmath8 , the debye mass @xmath9 , and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "since the relative velocity ( @xmath11 ) is very small ( @xmath12 )  @xcite , both types of scales are well separated .",
    "nowadays it is understood that the dissociation of heavy quarkonia is not due to the debye screening of the potential , but is rather overtaken by the thermal width obtained from the imaginary part of the potential  @xcite .",
    "there are two different processes in qcd , which contribute to the thermal width : the first process is the inelastic parton scattering mediated by the space - like gluons , when the debye mass is greater than the binding energy .",
    "this process is often referred as landau damping and is the principal source of dissociation mechanism at weak coupling .",
    "the second process is the gluon - dissociation process which corresponds to the decay of a color singlet state into a color octet induced by a thermal gluon and is dominant when the binding energy is greater than the debye mass  @xcite .",
    "recently one of us derived both the real and the imaginary component of the potential by correcting both the perturbative and nonperturbative ( string ) terms of the potential at t=0 in real - time formalism .",
    "we found that after inclusion of confining string term , the ( magnitude ) imaginary component becomes larger and hence contribute more to the thermal width , compared to the medium - modification of the perturbative term alone  @xcite however , the above discussions are limited to the weak coupling techniques .",
    "the large and anisotropic collective flow and its strong interaction with the hard probes at collider experiments indicate that the matter created must be described by qcd in a regime of strong interactions . in the strong coupling regime",
    ", the effect of an imaginary part in usual potential models has been addressed in @xcite , and also in the t - matrix approach through the schwinger - dyson equations @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part has also been calculated on the lattice @xcite , where the spectral functions have been extracted , using the limited sets of data .",
    "this fact , together with the intrinsic technical difficulties of lattice calculations , somehow limits the reliability of the results obtained so far , and also their scope .",
    "therefore some complementary methods for strong coupling at finite temperature are desirable .",
    "the ads / cft conjecture provides such an alternative  @xcite for a class of non - abelian thermal gauge field theories , which gives an analytic access to the strong coupling regime of finite temperature gauge field theories in the limit of large number of colors .",
    "this is achieved by mapping the problems at strong coupling onto calculable problems in the supergravity limit of a dual string theory .",
    "the background metric will be described by a curved five - dimensional ads spacetime containing a black hole with its horizon lying in the fifth dimension . although the ads / cft correspondence is not directly applicable to qcd , but the universality of the result for the shear viscosity - to - entropy ratio with the prediction of hydrodynamics in hic  @xcite motivates to calculate the heavy quark potential at finite temperature .",
    "the expectation values of wilson loops contain gauge invariant information about the nonperturbative physics of non - abelian gauge field theories .",
    "in fact , the expectation value of a particular time - like wilson loop serves to define the potential between a static quark and antiquark at finite temperature .",
    "the first calculation was done by maldacena  @xcite for @xmath13 sym for t=0 and was later extended to finite temperature in  @xcite .",
    "the potential is obtained by extremizing the world sheet of open string attached to the heavy quark and its anti quark located at the boundary of @xmath14 space in the background of @xmath14 space @xcite and in the background of @xmath14 black - hole metric  @xcite , for determining the potentials at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the problem with pure ads background is that it does not capture the renormalisation group running , like in qcd and does not give any confining term in the potential . in this work",
    "we use the ouyang - klebanov - strassler - black - hole ( oks - bh ) geometry @xcite explored recently in @xcite , which captures the logarithmic running of the coupling constants at far ir and is almost conformal at uv and calculate both real and imaginary parts of the potential at finite temperature by analytically continuing the string configurations into the complex plane .",
    "our work is organised as follows . in section 2 , we have revisited the oks - bh geometry in brief and in section 3 , we employ this geometry to construct the nambu - goto action for obtaining the potential .",
    "finally we conclude in section 4 .",
    "let us suppose a gauge theory living in @xmath17 dimensions defined at a particular energy scale @xmath18 .",
    "it can be thought of as being defined on a @xmath17 dimensional slice in a higher dimensional space and if we stack up all such slices together we can have a continuous family of gauge theories labelled by @xmath19 .",
    "we can imagine this continuous family as a single theory in five dimensions with @xmath19 becoming the fifth dimension .",
    "the flow along this energy scale is known as renormalisation group ( rg ) flow .",
    "now if the theory is conformal i.e. does not flow with energy ( @xmath19 ) , it can be described on the boundary of a five - dimensional space . in other words a conformal field theory ( cft ) can be described conveniently on the boundary of pure anti - de sitter ( ads ) space @xcite .",
    "but if the theory has a rg flow we can not describe the full theory simply by describing it on the boundary of some five dimensional space and we need to look differently at different energy scales .",
    "in particular for large n qcd , we have conformal behaviour at uv and logarithmic running of coupling at ir and we need to look differently at these two regimes . the geometries that can account for such a rg flow",
    "have been constructed and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we shall briefly review them here .",
    "[ [ section ] ] +    it has been seen that if we embed d branes in a geometry , the gauge theory living on these d branes may show logarithmic rg flow .",
    "a particular model that does this is the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) warped conifold construction @xcite . the gravity dual of this construction , which is a warped deformed conifold with three form type iib fluxes , captures the rg flow of the gauge theory .",
    "the corresponding gauge theory is confining in the far ir but is not asymptotically free .",
    "additionally , in ks picture the quarks are all in the bi - fundamental representations of the two possible uv gauge groups and they eventually cascade away in the far ir . also this construction is for zero temperature gauge theories .",
    "what we need is a dual gravity theory that allows quarks in the fundamental representation at high temperature .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the problem of having a fundamental quark can be resolved by inserting @xmath20 d7 branes in the ks geometry .",
    "this is a subtle issue and so far we only know how to insert coincident d7 branes in the klebanov - tseytlin background @xcite .",
    "the resulting background is the ouyang background @xcite that has all the type iib fluxes switched on , including the axio - dilaton . now to switch on a non zero temperature we need to insert a black hole into this background and the hawking temperature of the black hole will correspond to the gauge theory temperature . combining all physics ingredients together the metric in oks - bh geometry looks like @xmath21 + \\sqrt{h}\\big[g_2^{-1}(u ) du^2 + d{\\cal m}_5 ^ 2\\big]\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the warp factor , @xmath23 are the black - hole factors , @xmath24 denotes the extra dimension and @xmath25 is the metric of warped resolved - deformed conifold .",
    "in fact the complete picture can be divided into three regions .",
    "region 1 is the ir region where we have pure oks - bh geometry .",
    "region 3 is the uv region where uv cap has been added . and",
    "region 2 is the interpolating region between uv and ir .",
    "the background for all these three regions and the process of adding uv cap has been described in full details in @xcite .",
    "also the rg flow associated with these regions and the corresponding field theory realizations have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we shall not go into the complete details here and will use the metric given in eq.([eq : metric ] ) in extremizing the action to calculate the potential in the next section .",
    "one of the most important gauge invariant quantities defined in non - abelian @xmath54 gauge theories @xcite is the wilson loop @xmath55},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is a closed loop in a 4-dimensional spacetime , which is usually taken as a rectangular loop of spatial and temporal extensions @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "@xmath59 indicates path - ordering , @xmath60 is the coupling , @xmath61 is the non - abelian gauge field potential operator . the trace ( tr )",
    "is performed over the fundamental representation of the gauge field .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( o ) of the wilson loop gives the desired heavy quark potential @xmath62 : @xmath63 at finite temperature , the thermal average of the polyakov loop correlator ( @xmath64 ) gives the free energy of a heavy @xmath65 pair @xcite at finite temperature , which is quite often taken as the heavy quark potential at finite temperature on the lattice .",
    "however , the potential at finite temperature can also be obtained from the wilson loop s expectation value evaluated in a thermal state of the gauge theory : @xmath66 maldacena was the first to calculate the rectangular wilson loop in the vacuum of strongly coupled @xmath67 sym theory  @xcite and was later calculated in finite temperature from the correlator of two polyakov loops in @xcite . according to the gauge / gravity prescription @xcite , the expectation value of @xmath68 in a strongly coupled gauge theory dual to a theory of gravity is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the generating functional of the string in the bulk , having the loop @xmath71 at the boundary . in the classical gravity approximation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the classical string action propagating in the bulk evaluated at an extremum .    in general",
    "this heavy quark potential can have an imaginary part  @xcite , which contributes to the thermal decay width and is related to the imaginary part of the gluon self - energy .",
    "there are two processes responsible for the thermal width , namely the landau damping and the singlet to color octet transition . in ads / cft framework",
    ", people have obtained the non - zero imaginary part for large separation ( beyond a critical separation , @xmath74 ) by analytically continuing the string configurations into the complex plane  @xcite .",
    "recently the imaginary contribution has been obtained from the thermal fluctuation around the bottom of the sagging string in the bulk that connects the heavy quarks located at the boundary  @xcite , where the thermal fluctuation causes the maximum length of the sagging classical string to cross the horizon of the black hole and makes the potential absorptive . in both cases , the potential is obtained by extremizing the world sheet of open string attached to the heavy quark pair located at the boundary of @xmath14 space . recently a real - time complex potential @xmath75(t , r ) is derived from the wilson loop in the background of ads black hole by the analytic continuation from the imaginary time to the real time  @xcite , where the complex string configuration has been interpreted as a real string which is moving rather than being static .",
    "following the background geometry described above in section 2 , the nambu - goto action can be defined as @xmath76}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is background dilaton field .",
    "it is responsible for breaking of conformal symmetry of theory and is given by @xmath78 using the parametrization @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we extremize the open string worldsheet attached to a static quark at @xmath81 and an anti - quark at @xmath82 . using the metric given above in eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) , the nambu - goto action can be rewritten as @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 is the black hole horizon . by defining @xmath86",
    "the above action can be written in a closed form @xmath87 the nambu - goto action can also written as an integral over @xmath88 , @xmath89 since this action does not depend explicitly on @xmath90 , so the corresponding hamiltonian will be a constant of motion , i.e. , @xmath91 thus the constant @xmath92 can be determined as @xmath93 using the fact that at @xmath94 , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the maximum of the string coordinate along fifth dimension , we can find out @xmath97 by simple algebra @xmath98 integrating both sides , the above equation yields the separation @xmath57 as @xmath99 expanding the square root and keeping only the first term because the coefficients @xmath100 s are small , the separation ( @xmath57 ) becomes @xmath101 where the integral @xmath102 is defined by @xmath103    now we obtain the action by substituting @xmath97 from eq.([eq : z der ] ) into eq.([eq : action ] ) @xmath104 expanding the square root and keeping only the first two terms ( since the coefficients @xmath100 s are small ) , the action is obtained as @xmath105\\ ] ] after substituting the integral @xmath102 in terms of @xmath57 , the action becomes @xmath106    the first term in the action , @xmath107 diverges in the lower limit of the integration , so we regularize it by integrating from @xmath108 , instead of 0 to @xmath96  @xcite and identifying the divergent term in the integral @xmath109 where we take @xmath110 and @xmath111 and similarly @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "<S> in gauge - gravity duality , the heavy quark potential at finite temperature is usually calculated with the pure ads background , which does not capture the renormalization group ( rg ) running in the gauge theory part . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the potential does not contain any confining term in the deconfined phase . following the klebanov - strassler geometry , </S>",
    "<S> we employ a geometry , which captures the rg flow similar to qcd , to obtain the heavy quark potential by analytically continuing the string configurations into the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the attractive terms , the obtained potential has confining terms both at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , compared to the calculations usually done in the literature , where only the coulomb - like term is present in the deconfined phase . </S>",
    "<S> the potential also develops an ( negative ) imaginary part above a critical separation , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our potential exhibits a behavior different from the usual debye screening obtained from perturbation theory .    </S>",
