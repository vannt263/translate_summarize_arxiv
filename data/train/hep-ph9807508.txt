    "the recent cleo experiments related with and supply possibilities to extract the information about the structures of these two pseudoscalar mesons . for example , the cleo collaboration @xcite has reported very large branching ratios for inclusive production @xmath3 and for the exclusive decay @xmath4 @xmath5 to explain the abnormally large production of in the standard model , either large portion of intrinsic @xmath6 component in @xcite or large coupling of to @xmath7 @xcite , even both of them , must be concluded . at the same time , the data of the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 transition form factors at higher energies reported by cleo @xcite suggest that may have very different non - perturbative properties from @xmath11 and , while the latter two have similar wave functions .",
    "it is reasonable because the physical and states consist dominantly of flavor su(3 ) octet @xmath12 and singlet @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the usual mixing scheme reads    [ mixing ] latexmath:[\\ ] ]    from the bhl model .",
    "the transition form factor of su(3 ) singlet or octet is @xmath92 where @xmath93 or 8 presents the singlet or octet .",
    "the charge factors are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "the hard scattering amplitude @xmath100 is the same as eq .",
    "( [ hard ] ) and @xmath101 is the bhl wave function , eq .",
    "( [ bhlw ] ) , for each flavor quark with the corresponding @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 as input parameters .",
    "the quark mass @xmath103 in the factor from the melosh rotation will be adopted as @xmath105 mev or @xmath106 mev , depending on the flavor in @xmath101 .",
    "summing over all flavors , we obtain the transition form factors of physical @xmath0 and @xmath1 states from eq .",
    "( [ form ] )    [ lcphy ] @xmath107    which , to ensure the feasibility of perturbation theory , should be valid only for large @xmath25 . while fitting the data , we will choose only the data points with @xmath108 gev@xmath109 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the form factors @xmath110 and @xmath111 follow the same pattern of mixing as the state , eq .",
    "( [ mixing ] ) .",
    "as @xmath112 , the gauge invariance requires that eq .",
    "( [ lcphy ] ) contributes exact one half to @xmath113 .",
    "inputing a mixing angle @xmath79 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 can be fixed by @xmath113 .",
    "the theoretical predictions obtained from eq .",
    "( [ corrected ] ) are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath79 is @xmath116 .",
    "however , we find that the differences between different choices of @xmath79 are so small that it is in fact unreliable to determine the mixing angle , e.g. @xmath117 can not be excluded by the data .",
    "the reason is that @xmath113 , which we use as the normalization condition , shares the same mixing mechanism as the form factor @xmath118 .",
    "the only difference comes from the different contributions between the @xmath90 quark and the @xmath119(@xmath120 ) quark at different @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath121 , the mixing will be meaningless in this approach .",
    "the same conclusion also holds as @xmath48 , while all quarks can be treated as massless .",
    "since the perturbation calculations are only valid for large @xmath25 , this minor difference is negligible . at present",
    ", neither the data nor the theoretical approach has reached the accuracy to distinguish the @xmath90 or @xmath119(@xmath120 ) quark in the transition form factors of pseudoscalar mesons . therefore , unless other normalization conditions ( e.g. @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and so on . )",
    "are involved , it is unreliable to determine the mixing angle from the data of the transition form factors .",
    "inclusion of other normalization conditions brings additional uncertainties and goes beyond the present work .",
    "the  intrinsic quark \" is one of the novel properties for hadrons and there have been many examples where the non - valence  intrinsic quark \" components seem important @xcite .",
    "the flavor singlet meson @xmath13 may have a large portion of @xmath2 component and strong coupling to gluons through qcd axial anomaly .",
    "using operator product expansion and qcd low energy theorems , the non - perturbative intrinsic charm content of the meson was evaluated semi - quantitatively in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath125 mev , which suffices to explain the large production in @xmath126 decay reported by cleo .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite suggested @xmath127 mev to account for the data if @xmath2 pair is in color octet .",
    "especially , the sign of @xmath128 was fixed as minus in their work . a similar size , @xmath129 mev ,",
    "was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , too .",
    "the gluonic components of @xmath13 play no role in electromagnetic transition form factors because the coupling of two photons to two gluons is very small .",
    "they are invisible here .",
    "however , the @xmath2 pair has distinct behavior from the light quark pairs . unlike the @xmath130 pair",
    ", different sizes of @xmath2 component change the form factor a lot . in the following ,",
    "the current mass and constituent mass of @xmath131 quark are treated as the same and we adopt @xmath132 gev .",
    "the hard scattering amplitude for the heavy quark pair is @xmath133 it is noted that the helicity - flip amplitude can not be ignored since it is proportional to current quark mass .",
    "a direct calculation gives the higher helicity contributions as @xmath134 the total contributions of all helicity components can be expressed as eq .",
    "( [ lcsu3 ] ) by changing the hard scattering amplitude as @xmath135 the spacial wave function is written as @xmath136\\ .\\ ] ] the @xmath2 contributions to the transition form factor have very different @xmath25 behavior from light quark ones because of the higher helicity contributions , the heavy quark propagator , and the different wave function .",
    "comparison with light quark contributions is shown in fig .",
    "3 with their relative sizes at zero momentum transfer normalized to unity . this difference may result in observable effects in the transition form factors .",
    "now we explore the form factor with the interested value @xmath137 mev .",
    "the decay constant is connected with the wave function as the pionic case @xcite as @xmath138 the above decay constant is multiplied by a factor of @xmath139 comparing with the previous sections to be consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "@xmath140 is easily obtained by the definition of the decay constant , eq .",
    "( [ dc ] ) , with the input @xmath141 and the mixing angle @xmath79 .",
    "the mixing angle is fixed at @xmath142 because it is , by our numerical results , still not sensitive even when @xmath2 is included .",
    "at the same time , we neglect the difference between @xmath90 quarks and @xmath119(@xmath120 ) quarks in order to concentrate on @xmath131 quarks , i.e. , let @xmath143 mev .",
    "this approximation is valid since the difference is minor , which can be seen in last section .",
    "the obtained form factor , comparing with @xmath144 , is shown in fig .",
    "the corresponding decay constants are @xmath145 these values for light quarks are similar to that with @xmath144 because the @xmath2 contributions at zero momentum transfer are very small and change the normalization condition only slightly .",
    "they are not far from the naive expectation in su@xmath74(3 ) limit at @xmath142 : @xmath146    since the flavor singlet has different non - perturbative properties from that of the octet , the parameter @xmath86 is not necessarily the same as @xmath147 .",
    "in fact , with @xmath137 mev , a very good fit can be obtained by adjusting @xmath148 to 0.3 gev@xmath68 rather than @xmath149 gev@xmath68 .",
    "however , the decay constants will increase apparently for light quarks ( about 30% for @xmath119 and @xmath120 quark ) : @xmath150 this difference will result in apparent increasement to the radiative decay of mesons , such as @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "choi and ji @xcite have found that the same value @xmath154 for all of these flavor nonet mesons can produce satisfied decay widths for these decay channels .",
    "an increasement of 30% , if @xmath155 gev@xmath68 rather than @xmath85 , may exceed too much to fit the data of their radiative decays .",
    "therefore the above numerical results disfavor such a choice and thus disfavor a large portion of @xmath2 component as @xmath156 .",
    "there have been recently a number of investigations @xcite which support a small @xmath157 than that was estimated in ref .",
    "our above conclusion is in agreement with these results from other considerations .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath158 was suggested . to check the consistency of such a possibility in our approach , we adjust the input to @xmath159 and present the result in fig .  4 .",
    "the decay constants for different flavor quarks are @xmath160 with @xmath149 gev@xmath68 .",
    "we notice that the obtained results are very close to the case of @xmath161 and our analysis allow a small @xmath157 around @xmath162 .",
    "this is consistent with the results in refs .",
    "the electromagnetic transition form factors of @xmath0 and @xmath21 are presented comparing with @xmath20 in this paper .",
    "the numerical results show that there still exists a gap between the data and the light - cone perturbation calculation with the brodsky - huang - lepage wave function as the input for the non - perturbative aspects of the mesons . to model the higher fock state and higher order contributions",
    ", we assume that the fraction size of these contributions are similar to all three mesons : pion , @xmath0 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the ratio of the data of the @xmath8 transition form factor to the theoretical calculation is multiplied to the light - cone results of the @xmath9 and @xmath37 form factors .",
    "with such a correction , the obtained transition form factors can be compared with the data . in su@xmath74(3 ) , it is in fact unreliable to determine the mixing angle at present unless additional normalization conditions other than the @xmath163 decay widths are included .",
    "the reason is that the same mixing mechanism occurs in both the transition form factors and the normalization conditions .",
    "both the experimental ( especially for @xmath1 ) and theoretical accuracies are not high enough to distinguish the @xmath119(@xmath120 ) and @xmath90 quark pairs in these pseudoscalar mesons at high @xmath25 .",
    "the heavy quark pair has different @xmath25 behavior from the light ones .",
    "it is possible to explore the size of the @xmath2 component in the flavor singlet .",
    "our results disfavor a large portion of @xmath2 component in @xmath1 .",
    "such a conclusion is in agreement with a number of recent investigations with a small portion of intrinsic charm in from other considerations .",
