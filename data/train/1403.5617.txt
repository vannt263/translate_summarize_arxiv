    "the last decade has seen the emergence of highly popular online social networks like myspace , orkut and facebook .",
    "myspace was founded in 2003 and it gained its peak popularity in 2008 @xcite .",
    "however , most of the users have started abandoning it since 2008 @xcite .",
    "cannarella and spechler @xcite have modified the sir model of disease spread @xcite to explain this phenomenon . the disease spread model has also been used to study the arrival and departure dynamics of the users in social networks @xcite .    in this paper , we give an alternative explanation of the rise and fall of myspace . to begin with",
    ", we note that people join social networks due to the presence of their friends in these networks and leave them due to the inactivity of these friends @xcite .",
    "it is also known that a large number of the social network friendships are not active or strong friendships between the users @xcite , where a _ strong friendship _ between a pair of social network friends is indicated by regular communication between them .",
    "in fact , the well - known dunbar s number @xcite says that an individual can comfortably maintain a stable relationship with around 150 other people only .",
    "it means that the strong friendships are limited in a social network , even though there is no bound on the number of friends one can have in most social networks .    in order to identify the strong friendships between people in a social network , onella et .",
    "al @xcite did an empirical study to establish that greater neighbourhood overlap between a pair of friends corresponds to stronger friendships between them .",
    "the _ neighbourhood overlap _ between a pair of users @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a network is defined as the number of nodes who are neighbours of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 divided by the number of nodes who are neighbours of at least one of them .    since",
    "strong or active friendships are important for a user to remain in a social network @xcite , we study the change in the number of users who have at least a certain minimum number of strong friendships in an evolving social network created by the barabasi - albert random graph model @xcite , where we define a pair of users to be strong friends if their neighbourhood overlap is larger than a certain constant .",
    "we also study the change in the size of the largest connected component in the strong friendship subgraph of the evolving barabasi - albert random graph .",
    "this is motivated by the observation that the nodes in the core of a social network are more likely to survive than the nodes at the periphery @xcite .",
    "we consider the largest connected component in the strong friendship subgraph of a social network to be its _ core _ that is important to retain most of its users .",
    "our model is based on the well - known barabasi - albert model @xcite of social networks .",
    "the barabasi - albert model is an algorithm to generate random scale - free networks based on preferential attachment and growth .",
    "the preferential attachment is the property that a node with a higher degree is more likely to get connected to new nodes as the network grows .    starting with an initial collection of @xmath2 connected nodes",
    ", the barabasi - albert algorithm adds one node at a time to the network .",
    "each new node is connected to @xmath3 existing nodes as follows .",
    "the probability that the new node is connected to node @xmath4 is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the degree of node @xmath4 and @xmath7 is the sum of the degrees of all the nodes in the current network .",
    "the degree distribution resulting out of barabasi - albert model follows power law .",
    "let @xmath8 be the initial graph with @xmath2 vertices , and @xmath9 be the random graph after @xmath10 nodes have been added by the barabasi - albert algorithm . for a constant @xmath11 , we define two users in @xmath9 to be strong friends if their neighbourhood overlap is more than @xmath12 . for a given @xmath12 , the strong friendship subgraph @xmath13 of @xmath9 is defined as follows .",
    "the graph @xmath13 contains the same set of nodes as @xmath9 , and a pair of nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected by an edge in @xmath13 if and only if they are connected by an edge in @xmath9 and their neighbourhood overlap w.r.t .",
    "@xmath9 is more than @xmath12 .",
    "we run our experiments with three different values of @xmath12 , the threshold for the strong friendship between a pair of users . in each of the cases , we start with a complete graph with @xmath14 vertices , where @xmath15 is the the number of nodes every new node is connected to . in figures",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we plot the number of the users having at least @xmath16 ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ) strong friends in @xmath13 against the size of the graph @xmath13 for a given @xmath15 and @xmath12 . in each of these plots",
    ", we observe that this number increases till a point before starting to decrease .    in figures",
    "[ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , we plot the size of the largest connected component ( lcc ) in @xmath13 against the size of the graph @xmath13 for a given @xmath15 and @xmath12 . in each of these plots , we observe that the size of the largest connected component increases till a point , before it reaches a peak and starts decreasing . also , the decline is sharper for higher values of @xmath12 .",
    "our observations indicate that one possible explanation for the fall of myspace is that many of the users started to abandon it after they had a few strong friendships left in the network .",
    "moreover , the remaining users found it difficult to survive as the core of the strong friendship subgraph started reducing in size .",
    "since this might be the effect of preferential attachment where a popular user is likely to befriend a large number of other users , it would be interesting to see whether the same observation does nt hold for random evolving networks that have a restriction on the number of friends each person can have .",
    "it is also an interesting open problem to estimate the size of the network where the plots turn downward , as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath12 , for either of the properties mentioned above .",
