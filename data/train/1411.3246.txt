    "in plasma wakefield acceleration ( pwfa ) , a relativistic electron beam propagates through a plasma and drives electric and magnetic fields known as wakefields @xcite . in the blowout regime @xcite , a short ( approximately one plasma wavelength",

    "computational efficiency can be achieved using either boosted frames @xcite or the quasi - static approximation ( qsa ) . in the qsa , the disparity of the time scales of the evolution of beam driver and that of the background plasma allows one to achieve computational efficiency . for highly relativistic electron beam drivers ,",
    "the time scale of evolution is the betatron period @xmath5 which is much larger than the plasma time scale @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the plasma wavelength .",

    "this code was upgraded to include the trapping of energetic plasma particles @xcite .",
    "the trapping was implemented in the code by promoting plasma particles satisfying threshold conditions to become beam particles for which full equations of motion rather than quasi - static equations are solved .",

    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) vlasov simulations show that the initial plasma temperature is reduced in the first accelerating bucket behind the driver and thus the wake amplitude becomes insensitive to initial plasma temperature .",

    "two dimensional simulations using the quasi - static code lcode have shown that the amplitude of the spike is suppressed for non - zero plasma temperature @xcite . here ,",
    "we show that although the non - zero plasma temperature reduces the amplitude of the peak in two dimensions ( 2d ) , in agreement with other studies @xcite , it does not affect the energy gain or spread of the accelerated particles .",

    "for the two bunch scheme , the spike of the electric field which forms behind the driver bunch is suppressed for a range of values of the plasma temperature attainable in plasma wakefield experiments .",
