    "the study of the galaxy luminosity density in various bands is fundamental in understanding how galaxies formed and evolved in the universe .",
    "we start from the b - band luminosity function ( lf ) in the local universe by marzke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and by means of chemo - photometric models of galaxy evolution we aim at reconstructing the history of the luminous matter in the universe .",
    "our models calculate the chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type , i.e. ellipticals , spirals and irregulars .",
    "elliptical galaxies form by means of a rapid collapse of a gas cloud occurring at high redshift , which gives rise to an intense starburst ( matteucci 1992 ) .",
    "spirals galaxies form through a double - infall process ( chiappini et al .",
    "1997 ) and evolve with a continuous star formation history , whereas irregular galaxies form through continuous accretion of gas and form stars at a slower rate . for a detailed description of the chemical evolution models employed in our analysis , see calura et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . a photometric model ( jimenez et al . 1998 )",
    "is matched to our chemical evolution models , which allows us to calculate self - consistently the photometric evolution of the stellar populations in each galaxy type .",
    "we investigate two different initial mass functions : the salpeter and the scalo .",
    "we compute the b - band lf at a given redshift by means of the evolutive corrections obtained with our chemo - spectrophotometric code , and we obtain the lf in other bands ( u , i , k ) according to the computed galaxy colors .",
    "we then integrate the lfs assuming a schechter form . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we compare the results of our calculations with observations at various wavelengths in the case of galaxy formation at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the adopted cosmology is the `` concordance '' @xmath4cdm , characterized by @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the agreement with the data is good with both the adopted imfs .",
    "our main result is that spiral galaxies are the main contributors to the decline of the luminosity density in all bands between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "figure 3a shows the evolution of the predicted and measured cosmic sfr density in the case of a salpeter imf and galaxy formation at @xmath2 .",
    "our predictions well reproduce the strong evolution between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . during this long period spiral",
    "galaxies are the most active forming sites in the universe .",
    "the peak at high redshift is due to the intense starbursts occuring in elliptical galaxies , which at later times stop contributing significantly to the total sfr density .",
    "irregular galaxies are the least intense star forming sites at all epochs .",
    "the observations at high redshift do not confirm the existence of the peak predicted by our models , but it is widely known that the observations at short wavelengths which allow to detect the star formation activity are likely to suffer dust - extinction problems ( adelberger & steidel 2000 , massarotti et al .",
    "thus , if massive star formation occurred in galaxies strongly obscured by dust , it could remain unseen at short wavelengths .",
    "the light could be re - emitted by the dust in the sub - mm band , where observations could be fundamental in determining the true existence of such a peak .",
    "the total amount of metals produced at early epochs , corresponding to the redshift range where most of the high z abundance measures have been performed , is given by : @xmath16 , against the value obtained by pettini ( 1999 ) by assuming @xmath17 ( see pettini 1999 and references therein ) , which is @xmath18 .",
    "the observed contribution from dla systems and ly@xmath19 forest represents @xmath20 of such amount .",
    "this gives rise to the missing metal problem : where are the metals missing from the cosmic census at high redshift ?",
    "two possible solutions could be either that metals are hidden in still unseen lyman break and scuba galaxies or in warm gas forming ( proto- ) clusters .",
    "figure 3b shows the redshift evolution of the comoving density of neutral hydrogen , normalized to the critical density of the universe .",
    "once again , at @xmath1 we normalize our galaxies to the b - band luminosity function .",
    "our predictions are in reasonable agreement with the observations .",
    "dla systems are likely to dominate the neutral gas mass density of the high - redshift universe , whereas in the local universe , optical surveys indicate that @xmath21 of the neutral hydrogen mass is in spiral galaxies ( rao & briggs 1993 ) .",
    "we stress that our calculations depend on the @xmath1 normalization , based on optical observations .",
    "if the @xmath1 estimate of the total hi is much higher than what estimated in the optical bands ( rosenberg & schneider 2002 ) , this could mean that in the local universe the bulk of the neutral gas could hide in faint objects below the detection levels of the present - day optical surveys .",
