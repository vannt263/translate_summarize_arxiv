    "we have found that spherical shell dark solitons can , in fact , be dynamically robust , spectrally stable solutions of the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation within a certain interval of chemical potentials ( and atom numbers ) ; this occurs sufficiently close to the linear limit of relatively small chemical potentials . their instabilities , emerging when the chemical potential increases , have been elucidated and their dynamical outcome , namely the breakup into vortex ring and vortex line cages , has been showcased .",
    "we believe that these results , may not only be used to partially explain the transient observation of these structures in earlier experiments  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite , but may also pave the way for their consideration in future experiments .",
    "our work suggests a number of interesting future research directions , concerning , in particular , related coherent structures , their physical relevance and properties .",
    "for instance , this study suggests large scale stability computations for a wide range of pertinent steady states with radial symmetry , including ones with different numbers of radial nodes as well as a number of different external potentials .",

    "the greatest advantage of the 1d method involving the decomposition into spherical harmonics is that one can compute the spectrum for large chemical potentials without excessive computational costs .",
    "the reason that typical computations for large chemical potentials become computationally prohibitive , is that in this limit the density is large and , thus , the width of the relevant localized structures ( proportional to @xmath118 ) becomes much smaller than the domain size ( proportional to @xmath119 ) ; hence , a large number of mesh points is necessary to resolve properly these configurations .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth mentioning that , for the projection method in 1d , the form of states that one can study is also restricted by the spherical symmetry ; therefore , it is also relevant to employ an analog of this method in 2d , so as to encompass a wider class of states .",
    "an example concerns states with a topological charge @xmath120 along the @xmath9 axis , i.e. , stationary states of the form @xmath121 .",

    "therefore , the full 2d problem with charge appears to demand more computational work .",
    "however , it should be noted that , in the 2d case , the eigenvalues of the full matrix @xmath42 corresponding to the projections over the @xmath137 and @xmath138 modes are related via an orthogonal transformation and , thus , the two set of eigenvalues are complex conjugates of each other .",
