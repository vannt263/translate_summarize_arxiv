    "let @xmath1 be an oriented surface with negative euler characteristic .",
    "describing the representation variety of the fundamental group @xmath0 in a given lie group @xmath2 has been a major problem during the last two decades .",
    "the central object in this field is the character variety    @xmath3    this problem finds its source in the study of the teichmller space of @xmath1 , which classifies hyperbolic metrics or complex structures on @xmath1 .",
    "riemann s uniformization theorem implies that the teichmller space of @xmath1 may be seen as the subset of rep@xmath4 consisting of conjugacy classes of discrete , faithful and type - preserving representations . in the case where @xmath1 is closed without boundary ,",
    "goldman classified in @xcite the connected components of rep@xmath4 using the euler number of a representation .",
    "it turns out that the extremal values of the euler number correspond to two connected components of rep@xmath4 which are copies of the teichmller space of @xmath1 .",
    "since then , the question of classifying the connected components of rep@xmath5 , and understanding the situation of dicrete and faithful representations has been addressed for many lie groups ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this led to what is sometimes called _ higher teichmller theory_. the goal of this work is to present an explicit family of geometrically well - understood representations of the fundamental group of a cusped surface in pu(2,1 ) , the group of holomorphic isometries of the complex hyperbolic plane @xmath6 .    in the specific context of pu(@xmath7,1 ) and complex hyperbolic geometry ,",
    "the study of representations of surface groups has been initiated by goldman and toledo among others ( @xcite ) . since then",
    ", the question of the classification of connected components of rep@xmath8has been answered thanks to toledo s invariant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this invariant is defined as the integral over @xmath1 of the pull - back of the khler form on @xmath6 by a @xmath9-equivariant embedding of @xmath10 into @xmath6 .",
    "we will denote it by @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath1 is compact without boundary , the toledo invariant enjoys the following properties .",
    "* @xmath12 is a continuous function of @xmath9 .",
    "* @xmath13rep@xmath8 , @xmath14 . *",
    "@xmath12 satisfies a milnor - wood inequality : @xmath15 .",
    "xia proved in @xcite that two representations having the same toledo invariant lie in the same connected component of rep@xmath8 , and thus the toledo invariant classifies connected components of rep@xmath8 .",
    "extremal values of the toledo invariant characterizes those representations preserving a complex line on which they act properly discontinuously ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these results gave rise to considerable generalisations , from the context of complex hyperbolic space to the wider frame of hermitian symmetric spaces ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the question of discreteness of representations of surface groups in pu(@xmath7,1 ) is still far from being given a complete answer .",
    "it is known for instance that contrary to the case of psl(2,@xmath16 ) , discrete and faithful representations are not contained in specific components of rep@xmath17 , as shown for instance in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this work is concerned with representations of fundamental groups of cusped surfaces . in this case , the toledo invariant is defined for type - preserving representation ( that is , representations mapping classes of loops around punctures to parabolics ) , but it does not classify the topological components of rep@xmath8 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the question of the discreteness for such groups has been addressed in several works , see for example @xcite .    a classical way to produce non - trivial examples of representations of surface groups in pu(2,1 )",
    "is to start with a representation @xmath18 preserving a totally geodesic subspace @xmath19 of @xmath6 and to deform it .",
    "there are a priori two ways to do so in our case since there are two kinds of maximal totally geodesic subspaces in @xmath6 , namely _ complex lines _ and totally geodesic lagrangian planes , or _ real planes_. complex lines are embeddings of @xmath20 with sectional curvature @xmath21 , and real planes are embeddings of @xmath22 with sectional curvature @xmath23 .",
    "their respective stabilisers are p(u(1,1)@xmath24u(1 ) ) and po(2,1 ) ( see for instance @xcite ) . a discrete and faithful representation preserving a complex line ( resp .",
    "a real plane ) is called @xmath25-_fuchsian _ ( resp .",
    "@xmath16__-fuchsian _ _ ) .",
    "the rigidity results for @xmath25-fuchsian representations in the case of compact surfaces are no longer true for @xmath16-fuchsian representation see @xcite . + the purpose of this work is twofold .    1 .",
    "we first describe a family of representations obtained by a bending process .",
    "they arise as holonomies of equivariant mappings from the farey set of a surface @xmath1 to the boundary of @xmath6 . roughly speaking",
    ", we are bending along the edges of an ideal triangulation of @xmath1 , and the case were the representation is @xmath16-fuchsian corresponds to vanishing bending angles ( theorem [ realbend ] ) .",
    "2 .   we identify within this family of examples a subfamily of discrete , faithful , and type - preserving representations ( theorem [ theodiscret ] ) .",
    "the proof of discreteness is done by showing that the action of @xmath26 on @xmath6 is discontinuous .",
    "we obtain in turn a 1-parameter family of embeddings of the teichmller space of @xmath1 into rep@xmath8containing only classes of discrete , faithful representations with unipotent boundary holonomy ( theorem [ theoembed ] ) .    in the context of @xmath6 ,",
    "deformations by bending were first described by apanasov in @xcite .",
    "more recently , in @xcite , platis has described a complex hyperbolic version of thurston s quakebending deformations for deformations of @xmath16-fuchsian representations of groups in the case of closed surfaces without boundary .",
    "if @xmath18 is an @xmath16-fuchsian representation of @xmath0 and @xmath27 is a finite geodesic lamination with a complex transverse measure @xmath28 , platis shows that there exists @xmath29 such that any quakebend deformation @xmath30 of @xmath18 is complex hyperbolic quasi - fuchsian for all @xmath31 .",
    "the proof of discreteness in @xcite rests on the main result in @xcite where the proof of discreteness is done by building a fundamental domain .",
    "+ in order to sum up our work , let us introduce a little notation . + throughout this work , we denote by @xmath1 a oriented surface of genus @xmath32 with @xmath33 deleted points , which we denote by @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 has negative euler characteristic , that is , @xmath35 .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the fundamental group of @xmath1 .",
    "it admits the following presentation    @xmath36\\prod c_j=1{\\rangle},\\ ] ]    where the @xmath37 s are the homotopy classes of simple loops enclosing the punctures @xmath38 of @xmath1 .",
    "the universal cover of @xmath1 is an open disc @xmath39 , with a @xmath40-invariant family of points on its boundary corresponding to the deleted points of @xmath1 .",
    "this set of boundary points is called the _ farey set _ of @xmath1 , and denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "if one fixes a finite area hyperbolic structure on @xmath1 , the farey set consists of the fixed points of parabolic elements representing homotopy classes of loops around punctures .",
    "in particular , if the holonomy of this hyperbolic structure has its image in psl(2,@xmath42 ) , one recovers this way the usual farey set @xmath43 .",
    "the idea of shear coordinates on the teichmller space of a cusped surface goes back to the eighties with thurston @xcite , bonahon @xcite and penner @xcite .",
    "the principle is the following . in order to build a hyperbolic structure on a cusped surface @xmath1",
    ", it suffices to glue together ideal triangles in the upper half plane .",
    "since there is a unique ideal triangle up to the action of , the only gluing invariant is the cross ratio of the four boundary points associated to a pair of adjacent triangles , which measures the shearing of the two triangles .",
    "it is therefore very natural to parametrize structures by decorating triangulations , using ( positive ) real numbers that should be interpreted as cross ratios .",
    "in particular , penner defined the decorated teichmller space of a punctured surface in @xcite , and gave a description of it in this way .",
    "later , these ideas were successfully exploited and generalised by fock and goncharov to study representations of cusped surfaces in real split lie groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to give an efficient combinatorial description of a representant of the class of representation of @xmath0 associated to a given decoration ( see for instance @xcite ) , which we are going to adapt to our context ( section [ explicit ] ) .    as shown in @xcite",
    ", it is possible to describe a similar system of explicit coordinates on an open subset of rep@xmath8which contains all the classes of discrete and faithful representations .",
    "however , identifying those classes of representations that are indeed discrete remains out of reach .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to a family of representations obtained by making an additional geometric assumption . more precisely , our first goal is to classify what we call _ @xmath44-bent realizations _ of @xmath41 in @xmath6 , where @xmath44 is an ideal triangulation of @xmath1 , that is pairs @xmath45 , where    * @xmath9 is a representation @xmath46 isom(@xmath6 ) , * @xmath47 is a @xmath48-equivariant mapping , * for any face @xmath49 of @xmath50 with vertices @xmath51 , the three points @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 form a real ideal triangle of @xmath6 , that is , they belong to the boundary of a real plane of @xmath6 .",
    "it is natural to use this formalism because of the following remark .",
    "consider a hyperbolic structure on @xmath1 with holonomy @xmath55 a subgroup of psl(2,@xmath42 ) .",
    "each point of the farey set @xmath43 is the fixed point of a unique primitive parabolic element of @xmath55 , corresponding to a peripheral loop . now taking @xmath55 as a fuchsian model for @xmath0 , any other finite area hyperbolic structure on @xmath1 gives rise to a discrete , faithful and type preserving representation @xmath56 .",
    "one associates to @xmath9 an equivariant mapping @xmath57 by sending any point @xmath58 in the farey set corresponding to the fixed point of the primitive parabolic @xmath59 to the fixed point of @xmath60 ( see also section [ embed ] ) .    in order to parametrize these bent realizations ,",
    "we need a gluing invariant for pairs of real ideal triangles in @xmath6 . in the context of psl(2,@xmath16 ) , this invariant is the cross - ratio : the unique invariant of a pair of ideal triangles of @xmath20 sharing an edge . in the complex hyperbolic context , a pair of real ideal triangles sharing an edge in @xmath6 is determined up to holomorphic isometry by a single complex number @xmath61 .",
    "this @xmath62-invariant is similar to the kornyi - reimann cross - ratio on the heisenberg group ( see @xcite and remark [ simkr ] in section [ invz ] ) . note that @xmath62 is an invariant of ordered pairs of real ideal triangles , in the sense that    @xmath63    this invariant was first used by falbel in @xcite to glue ideal tetrahedra in @xmath6 .",
    "falbel needs two such parameters to describe the isometry class of an ideal tetrahedron .",
    "we only need one since we only consider pairs of real ideal triangles , which correspond in his terminology to the particular case of symmetric tetrahedra ( see section 4.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the modulus of @xmath62 is similar to the cross - ratio in @xmath20 : it measures the shearing between two real ideal triangles .",
    "its argument is the _ bending parameter _ , which can be seen as the measure of an angle between real planes . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath62 is real , the two adjacent real ideal triangles are contained in a common real plane .",
    "we will therefore call a _ bending decoration _ of @xmath44 any application @xmath64 ( the two cases where @xmath65 or @xmath66 correspond to degenerate triangles ) .    as in the case of psl(2,@xmath16 ) , it is possible to associate @xmath44-bent realizations to bending decorations and we obtain an explicit expression for the images of classes of loops by @xmath9 .",
    "we do this in the same spirit as in @xcite .",
    "once an ideal triangulation of @xmath1 is chosen , any element @xmath67 of @xmath0 can be represented by a sequence of edges of the modified dual graph ( see definition [ dual ] ) . using the decoration , we associate to each edge of this graph an elementary isometry , and the image of @xmath67 by @xmath9 is the product of the corresponding elementary isometry .",
    "these elementary isometries are either elliptic elements of order 3 , or antiholomorphic involutions .",
    "the latter appear as the unique isometries exchanging two real ideal triangles with a common edge .",
    "they have to be antiholomorphic because of relation ( [ z - orient ] ) . as a consequence the image of a homotopy class by @xmath9 is not always holomorphic .",
    "this is why the representation @xmath9 is taken in isom(@xmath6 ) rather than in pu(2,1 ) , which is the index two subgroup of isom(@xmath6 ) containing holomorphic isometries .",
    "however , for some special triangulations , the image of the representation is in fact contained in pu(2,1 ) .",
    "namely , we show in section [ when ] , that the representation @xmath9 associated to a @xmath44-bent realization of @xmath41 is holomorphic if and only if @xmath44 is _ bipartite _ , that is if its dual graph is bipartite .",
    "now , any cusped surface @xmath1 admits a bipartite ideal triangulation ( proposition [ existbipar ] ) .",
    "this bending process produces thus representations of @xmath0 in pu(2,1 ) for any non compact @xmath1 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath68 the set of bending decorations of an ideal triangulation @xmath44 and by @xmath69 the quotient of @xmath68 by the action of complex conjugation .",
    "the first result of our work is the following .",
    "+    [ realbend ] there is a bijection between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , we associate to any bending decoration a pair @xmath72 of pu(2,1)-classes of bent realizations of @xmath41 , which represent the same isom(@xmath6)-class of realization . the complex conjugation of bending representations corresponds to the permutation @xmath73 .",
    "this result is proved in section [ proof2 ] .",
    "after having classified @xmath44-bent realizations , we focus on a special kind : those @xmath44-bent realizations corresponding to _ regular _ bending decorations , that is decorations of the form @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a positive decoration of @xmath44 , and @xmath76-\\pi,\\pi]$ ] is a fixed real number . when @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath44-bent realizations where all the images of the points of @xmath41 are contained in a real plane .",
    "the corresponding representations are @xmath16-fuchsian .",
    "+ if @xmath78 is a class of peripheral loop on @xmath1 the parabolicity of @xmath79 is simply expressed in terms of the decoration .",
    "if @xmath80 is the puncture of @xmath1 surrounded by @xmath78 , and @xmath81 are the edges of @xmath44 adjacent to @xmath80 , the isometry @xmath79 is parabolic if and only if the product @xmath82 has modulus 1 .",
    "such a decoration @xmath83 is said to be _ balanced at @xmath80 _ ( see section [ holes ] ) .",
    "we now state the main result of our work .",
    "+    [ theodiscret ] let @xmath44 be a bipartite ideal triangulation of @xmath1 , @xmath76-\\pi,\\pi[$ ] be a real number and @xmath83 be a regular bending decoration of @xmath44 with angular part equal to @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a representative of the ( unique ) isom(@xmath6)-class of representations associated to @xmath83",
    ". then    1 .   for any index @xmath85",
    ", @xmath86 is parabolic if and only if @xmath83 is balanced at @xmath87 .",
    "2 .   the representation @xmath9 does not preserve any totally geodesic subspace of @xmath6 , unless @xmath77 , in which case it is @xmath16-fuchsian .",
    "3 .   as long as @xmath88 $ ] , the representation @xmath9 is discrete and faithful .",
    "the bending and discreteness theorems are generalisations to the case of any punctured surface of results obtained in @xcite in the case of the punctured torus .",
    "if we restrict this result to those decorations @xmath83 which are balanced at every puncture , we obtain a 1-parameter family of embeddings of the teichmller space of @xmath1 in rep@xmath8@xmath0 .",
    "the images of these embedding contain only classes of discrete , faithful and type - preserving representations , parametrised by @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "note that the family of embeddings obtained depends on the initial choice of the triangulation .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theodiscret ] goes as follows . from a bending decoration ,",
    "we construct a family of real ideal triangles on which @xmath26 acts because of the equivariance condition . under the hypotheses of theorem [ theodiscret],we",
    "are able to define for each pair @xmath89 of real ideal triangles a canonical real hypersurface of @xmath6 called the _ splitting surface _ of @xmath90 and @xmath91 and denoted by spl@xmath89 .",
    "the main steps of the proof consist in proving the following properties for these hypersurfaces .    1 .",
    "the splitting surface spl@xmath89 separates @xmath6 in two connected components , each of which contains one of @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( proposition [ splitplits ] ) .",
    "2 .   if @xmath90 is surrounded by three real ideal triangles @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the three splitting surfaces spl@xmath95 are mutually disjoint ( theorem [ crucial ] ) .",
    "it is a direct consequence of these facts that all the constructed triangles are disjoint , and @xmath96 acts discontinuously on their union , and is therefore discrete .",
    "the union of all the triangles constructed is a piecewise totally geodesic disc .",
    "splitting surfaces are examples of spinal @xmath16-surfaces ( see section [ defispinal ] ) , which are the inverse images of geodesics by the orthogonal projection on real planes .",
    "this terminology refers to mostow s spinal surfaces , defined in @xcite , which are the inverse images of geodesic by the orthogonal projection on a complex line ( spinal surfaces are often called _ bisectors _ , see @xcite ) .",
    "spinal @xmath16-surfaces appeared first in @xcite under the name of @xmath16-balls .",
