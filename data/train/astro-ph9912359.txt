    "the last few years have changed our view on the evolution of galaxies : the most distant galaxies ( i.e. systems having stellar population ) have been found at @xmath0=6.68 ( chen et al . , 1999 ) and radio galaxies at @xmath0=5.2 ( van breugel et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "some of models suggests that galaxies can start their formation at @xmath0=17 ( chen et al . , 1999a ) .",
    "to understand deeper a situation with a stellar population of galaxies and to check various mordern models it is very important to have a capability to detect correctly an age of galaxies .",
    "the labour intensity of obtaining statistically significant high - quality data on distant and faint galaxies and radio galaxies forces one to look for simple indirect procedures in the determination of redshifts and other characteristics of these objects . with regard to radio galaxies ,",
    "even photometric estimates turned out to be helpful and have so far been used ( mccarthy , 1993 ; benn et al . , 1989 ) .    in the late 1980s and early 1990s",
    "it was shown that the color characteristics of galaxies can yield also the estimates of redshifts and ages for the stellar systems of the host galaxies .",
    "numerous evolutionary models appeared with which observational data were compared to yield results strongly differed from one another ( arimoto and yoshii , 1987 ; chambers and charlot , 1990 ; lilly , 1987 , 1990 ) .    over the last few years",
    "the three models : pegase ( project deetude des galaxies par synthese evolutive ( fioc and rocca - volmerange , 1997 ) ) , poggianti ( 1997 ) and gissel96 ( bruzual , charlot , 1996 ) , have been extensively used , in which an attempt has been made to eliminate the shortcomings of the previous versions .    in the `` big trio '' experiment ( parijskij et al . , 1996 )",
    "we also attempted to apply these techniques to distant objects of the rc catalogue with ultra steep spectra ( uss ) .",
    "color data for nearly the whole basic sample of uss frii ( fanaroff and riley , 1974 ) rc objects have been obtained with the 6 m telescope of sao ras .    to accelerate a procedure of age ( and photometric redshift ) estimation",
    "we have begun a project `` evolution of radio galaxies '' , supported by the russian foundation of basic research ( grant no.99 - 07 - 90334 ) , which has to allow a user to obtain age and photometric redshift estimations .",
    "this system , being developed at present , will allow a user to operate with simulated curves of spectral energy distributions ( sed ) to estimate ages and redshifts by photometral data .",
    "authors use seds of three models :        the system will be situated on the special web - server unifying various type resources , including specialized internet protocol daemons ( for the ftp , http , e - mail support ) and the designed software permitting a user to operate with the sed curves .",
    "requesting and filling in the standard html - forms a user will be able to select different types of curves or trust to do this to a computer by the @xmath1 method .",
    "the input forms contain information about input filters or wavelengths and corresponding magnitudes .",
    "the estimation of ages and redshifts iss performed by way of selection of the optimum location on the sed curves of the measured photometric points obtained when observing radio galaxies in different filters .",
    "we use the already computed table sed curves for different ages .",
    "the algorithm of selection of the optimum location of points on the curve consists briefly ( for details see verkhodanov , 1996 ) in the following : by shifting the points lengthwise and transverse the sed curve such a location was to be found at which the sum of the squares of the discrepancies was a minimum . through moving over wavelengths and flux density along the sed curve we estimate the displacements of the points from the location of the given filter and",
    "then the best fitted positions were used to compute the redshift . from the whole collection of curves ,",
    "we select the ones on which the sum of the squares of the discrepancies turned out to be minimal for the given observations of radio galaxies .      in order to take account of the absorption ,",
    "we apply the maps ( as fits - files ) from the paper `` maps of dust ir emission for use in estimation of reddening and cmbr foregrounds '' ( schlegel et al . ,",
    "the conversion of stellar magnitudes to flux densities are performed by the formula ( e.g. von hoerner , 1974 ) : @xmath2      * sorted bibliographical collection of papers for different stages of radio galaxy evolution , * archive of radio galaxies data in various wavelength ranges ( both observed in special astrophysical observatory and taken from internet ) and * search for information about radio galaxies using the largest data bases ned , cats , leda et al . very close interaction with the cats database ( verkhodanov et al . , 1996 ) , designed and situated in the sao , is supposed in the radio sources identification .",
