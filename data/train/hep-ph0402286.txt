    "hadron interactions used to be considered as proceeding via collisions of their constituent partons . in preparton times , their role was played by pions , and the one - meson exchange model @xcite dominated .",
    "pions were treated as hadron constituents .",
    "their high energy interaction produced a ladder of one - pion @xmath2-channel exchanges with blobs of low energy pion - pion interactions .",
    "this is the content of the multiperipheral model .",
    "these blobs were first interpreted as @xmath3 mesons @xcite and later called fireballs @xcite , clusters @xcite or clans @xcite when higher mass objects were considered .",
    "multiperipheral dynamics tells us that the number of these blobs is distributed according to the poisson law .",
    "it was argued that its convolution with the distribution of the number of pions produced in each center can lead to a negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) of created particles first introduced in @xcite .",
    "this supposition fits experimental data on multiplicity distributions of @xmath4 reactions at tens of gev quite well .",
    "however , at higher energies this fit by a single nbd becomes unsatisfactory .",
    "a shoulder appears at high multiplicities .",
    "it is quite natural to ascribe it to multiple parton - parton collisions @xcite , which could lead , e.g. , to two- , three- , and so on , ladder formation @xcite , and/or to different ( soft , hard ) types of interactions @xcite .",
    "they become increasingly important as the collision energy is increased .",
    "better fits are achieved at the expense of a larger number of adjustable parameters .",
    "this shortcoming can be minimized if one assumes that each of the high energy binary parton collisions is independent of others proceeding simultaneously . with this supposition ,",
    "the whole process is described as a set of independent pair parton interactions ( the ippi model ) .",
    "in fact , we assume democracy in sharing the initial energy of colliding hadrons among their constituents .",
    "the effective multiplicity of particles produced by a pair of initial partons does not depend on how many other pairs interact or on what these interacting partons are ( quarks or gluons ) .",
    "while parton energies vary widely at a given hadron energy , the mean amount of energy involved in each parton - parton collision can be comparable .",
    "therefore , we hope that this simplification is valid at very high energies for such global characteristics as multiplicity distributions which result from an average over the whole phase space . if necessary , this supposition can be relaxed by introducing the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) . the inclusive distributions would call for a more detailed description .",
    "the ippi model does not imply that there are no correlations between particles .",
    "they are intrinsic in each binary collision and in their convolution .",
    "surely , further correlations between these interacting pairs of partons , of both dynamical and kinematical origin , can be introduced .",
    "nevertheless , the simplest model with minimum parameters and its most general characteristics such as multiplicity distributions should be treated first .",
    "for multiplicity distributions , we suppose that a parton - parton collision gives rise to a negative binomial distribution of its products with parameters independent of the colliding partons because the energy is equally shared between them .",
    "therefore , the resulting distribution of independent pair parton interactions is given by a sum of convolutions of processes with different number of participating pairs of partons weighted according to their probabilities .",
    "thus one can write @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the probability of creating @xmath7 particles , which depends on the parameters of the nbd distribution @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the number of particles produced by the @xmath11th pair , @xmath12 is the probability for the @xmath13th pair to be active and @xmath14 is a number of active pairs .",
    "therefore , the following equations are valid @xmath15 the symbolical notation @xmath16 means the convolution of nbd expressions subject to the first equation in ( [ cond ] ) , i.e. , the sum must be taken only over those parton collisions whose multiplicities @xmath10 sum up to the total number of produced particles @xmath7 .",
    "the nbd shape @xmath17 is characterized by two parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , corresponding to the mean multiplicity and the dispersion @xmath18 of the distribution for a single interaction , @xmath19 it is our supposition that , weighted by the parton distribution functions , such an interaction at a fixed parton - parton energy leads to a nbd .",
    "this is based on the success of low energy fits . in multiperipheral - type models with a poisson distribution of created blobs",
    ", this would imply a gamma distribution of the decay products of these blobs .",
    "for example , the formula ( [ pn ] ) explicitly written for three active parton pairs is as follows    @xmath20    each of the three terms in this sum represents a negative binomial distribution because @xmath21 this is a general remarkable property of negative binomial distributions : their convolutions result again in nbd functions with parameters multiplied by the number of convolutions .",
    "( [ pn ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath22 this is the main equation of the ippi model .",
    "one gets a sum of negative binomial distributions with shifted maxima and larger widths for a larger number of collisions .",
    "no new adjustable parameters appear in the distribution for @xmath13 pairs of colliding partons .",
    "all parameters are expressed in terms of the products of parameters for a single collision and the number of collisions .",
    "both the mean multiplicity and dispersion @xmath23 for the process with @xmath13 active parton pairs are proportional to @xmath13 . in the total multiplicity distribution , the distributions for collisions of @xmath13 pairs of partons , @xmath24 , are just weighted with their probabilities @xmath12 , which are determined by collision dynamics and , in principle , can be evaluated if some model is adopted ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "an increase in the number of interacting pairs of partons in the ippi model with energy gives rise to more probabilities @xmath12 different from zero .",
    "certainly , all the parameters @xmath25 depend on energy .",
    "this dependence is implied but not shown explicitly in the above formulas .",
    "one can hope that at asymptotically high energies the probability for @xmath13 pairs of independent interactions @xmath12 is the product of @xmath13 probabilities @xmath26 for one pair , @xmath27 from the normalization condition @xmath28 one can find @xmath26 if @xmath14 , which is determined by the maximum number of parton interactions at a given energy , is known .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath26 ranges between 1 at low energies ( for @xmath14=1 ) and 0.5 at asymptotics where @xmath14 tends to infinity . with energy increase",
    ", it approaches the second value from above , passing through some thresholds , and is already quite close to it at the present highest energies .",
    "thus we are left with only two parameters of the model , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which can be found from fits of experimental data .",
    "the dependence on the number of collisions @xmath14 and on the probabilities @xmath12 is determined by the behavior of the moments of probabilities @xmath29 as explicitly shown in the appendix for ranks @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the average multiplicity is given by @xmath31 if one assumes some extrapolation of @xmath32 to higher energies , it can be used for prediction of the distributions .",
    "let us emphasize that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath8 is directly related to that of the mean multiplicity , @xmath33 the value of @xmath8 is usually quite close to the position of the maximum of the distribution .",
    "thus the relation ( [ mas ] ) tells us that in the ippi model the asymptotic mean multiplicity is about twice larger than the location of its maximum determined mainly by a single parton - parton interaction .",
    "one can expect that the asymptotic relation for the probabilities ( [ wjw1 ] ) becomes valid only at energies where four or more pairs are already active .",
    "this series becomes a polynomial at finite energies . in practice",
    ", the threshold effects should also be taken into account at finite energy .",
    "they would somewhat suppress @xmath12 at the largest @xmath13 and , correspondingly , enlarge the role of one- and two - pair interactions .    in @xcite , the energy dependence of the probabilities @xmath12",
    "was estimated according to the multiladder exchange model @xcite but poisson distributions were used for each of the ladders .",
    "the probabilities are given by the following normalized expressions @xmath34 where @xmath35 with numerical parameters obtained from fits of the experimental data on total and elastic scattering cross sections : @xmath36 gev@xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 gev@xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath40 @xmath38 @xmath41 @xmath38 @xmath42 gev@xmath37 , @xmath43 = 1 gev@xmath44 .",
    "below , we will use both possibilities ( [ wjw1 ] ) and ( [ kter ] ) in our attempts to describe the experimental data .",
    "the probabilities @xmath12 are different for each ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) . in the ippi model",
    "they decrease exponentially with increasing number of active partons , while in the ladder model they are inversely proportional to this number with additional suppression at large @xmath13 due to the term in parentheses in ( [ kter ] ) .",
    "this is the result of the modified eikonal approximation .",
    "we show the values @xmath12 for 36 pairs calculated according to eq .",

    "( [ kter ] ) in its right - hand side .",
    "these values @xmath14 are chosen because they will be used in the comparison with experiment .",
    "in particular , we shall choose @xmath45 at 300 and 546 gev , 4 at 1000 and 1800 gev , 5 at 14 tev , and 6 at 100 tev ( see below ) .",

    "the value of @xmath26 is always larger than 0.5 in the ippi model while it can become less than 0.5 in the ladder model @xcite at high energies . in the ladder model , @xmath12",

    "we show their values at 546 and 1800 gev in the right - hand side columns of @xmath14=3 and 4 .",
    "those at 300 and 1000 gev are larger for @xmath26 by about 1@xmath46 and smaller for @xmath47 by about 3@xmath46 .",
    "when the energy increases , the processes with a larger number of active pairs play a more important role in the ladder approach compared to the ippi model .",
    "thus , the @xmath14 cutoff is also more essential there .    in principle",
    ", one can immediately try a two - parameter fit of experimental multiplicity distributions using eq .",
    "( [ pnj ] ) if @xmath12 are known .",
    "however , the use of their moments is preferred as shown below .",
    "the shapes of the multiplicity distributions @xmath48 usually look quite complicated .",
    "often , they are better represented by their moments , which also contain complete information .",
    "the easiest way to define them is to introduce the generating function @xmath49 in what follows , we will use the so - called unnormalized factorial @xmath50 and cumulant @xmath51 moments defined according to the formulas @xmath52 @xmath53 they correspondingly determine the total and genuine correlations among the particles produced ( for more details , see @xcite ) . for @xmath54",
    ", they define the mean multiplicity ; the second moment is related to the width of the distribution , etc .",
    "the factorial moments are evaluated from experimental data according to their definition ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "both @xmath55 and @xmath56 grow , however , extremely fast with their ranks .",

    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ hqfq ] ) .    recall that these ratios appear quite naturally in qcd as the solutions of the equations for the generating functions of multiplicity distributions @xcite .",
    "therefore , their use is especially informative because one can compare experimental results and model calculations with analytical qcd predictions for jets in @xmath1 annihilation as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "qcd predicts a very specific behavior of the @xmath59 moments as functions of ranks @xmath60 and energy .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath59 for jets at the present energies ( slc , lep ) should oscillate , and this prediction has been confirmed by experimental results @xcite .",
    "the first minimum is located near @xmath61 at z@xmath62 energy . at higher energies , this minimum moves to larger values of @xmath60 ; the oscillations become less pronounced and disappear in the asymptotics where @xmath63 . moreover , these oscillations have been found @xcite even for experimentally studied @xmath4 and @xmath64 collisions . in these cases , they can be ascribed to the multicomponent structure of the processes . such a structure",
    "is incorporated in the ippi model according to eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) .",
    "we will see if it is enough to describe experimental data .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath59 moments are very sensitive to minute details of the multiplicity distributions and can be used to distinguish between different models and experimental data .",
    "however , one should be warned that the amplitudes of the oscillations strongly depend on the multiplicity distribution cutoff due to limited experimental statistics ( or by another reasoning ) if the experiment is done at rather low multiplicities .",

    "these moments decrease with increase of @xmath9 and @xmath60 .    once the parameter @xmath9 is found from fits of @xmath59 , it is possible to get another parameter @xmath8 by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ fphi ] ) as follows : @xmath72 this formula is a sensitive test for the whole approach because it states that the definite ratio of @xmath60-dependent functions to the power @xmath73 becomes @xmath60 independent if the model is correct .",

    "therefore , it can be considered as a criterion for a proper choice of @xmath9 and for the model validity , in general .",

    ", one should use some guesses . since @xmath8 has the meaning of the average multiplicity of a binary parton collision",

    "it is well known that experimental cutoffs of multiplicity distributions due to the limited statistics of an experiment can influence the behavior of @xmath59 moments .",
    "consequently , they impose some limits on the @xmath60 values that can be considered when a comparison is done .",
    "higher rank moments can be evaluated if larger multiplicities have been measured .",

    "the parameter @xmath8 increases logarithmically with energy .",

    "the energy dependence of @xmath9 ( crosses ) is more complicated and rather irregular .",
    "we tried to ascribe the latter to the fact that the effective values of @xmath9 , which we actually find from these fits , depend on the effective number of parton interactions , i.e. , on the @xmath12 variation at a threshold .",

    "hence , we have to conclude that this effect results from some dynamics of the hadron interactions that is not understood yet and should be incorporated in the model .",
    "the preliminary explanation of this effect could be that at the threshold of new pair formation the previous active pairs produce more squeezed multiplicity distributions due to the smaller phase - space room available for them because of the newcomer .",
    "therefore , the single pair dispersion decreases and the @xmath9 values increase . this would imply that thresholds are marked not only by the change of @xmath12 shown in table  [ tab : table1 ] but also by the variation of the parameter @xmath9 .",

    "this difference becomes more pronounced at 100 tev . to keep the same mean multiplicity in both models at the same energy , we have chosen different values of @xmath8 as dictated by eq .",

    "the present approach proposes more economic way with a smaller number of such parameters .",
    "concerning the further development of event generator codes , it is tempting to incorporate there the above approach with a negative binomial distribution of particles created by a single parton pair , and confront the results with a wider set of experimental data .",

    "qcd fits of multiplicity distributions in @xmath1 collisions and ippi model fits of @xmath0 collisions are completely unrelated and can not be compared .",
    "there is , however , one definite qcd prediction that allows us to ask the question whether qcd and the ippi model are compatible .",
    "this is the asymptotic behavior of @xmath59 moments in qcd .",
    "they should behave @xcite as @xmath96 .",
    "one can also determine the asymptotics of @xmath59 moments in the ippi model and compare both approaches .",
    "the asymptotical values of the probabilities @xmath12 ( [ wjw1 ] ) and their moments @xmath97 ( [ mr ] ) for @xmath30 are as follows : @xmath98 inserting them in the expressions for @xmath99 and @xmath74 given in the appendix , one can evaluate the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath59 moments in the ippi model at any parameter @xmath9 .",
    "all asymptotic @xmath59 are decreasing functions of @xmath9 .",
    "their minimum values are reached at @xmath100 , i.e. , for a convolution of poisson distributions .",
    "they are given by the ratio of the coefficients in front of the leading @xmath101 terms in @xmath99 and @xmath74 ( see the appendix ) and are equal to @xmath102 these values are noticeably larger than qcd predictions of @xmath103 .",
    "since they are even larger for any finite parameter @xmath9 , we have to state that qcd and the ippi model have different asymptotics .",
    "in other words , this implies that eq .",
    "( [ hqph ] ) , considered as an equation for @xmath74 with @xmath63 inserted in it , does not have a solution with asymptotical values of @xmath97 [ eq .",
    "( [ wm ] ) ] in the ippi model .",
    "it is an open question whether other asymptotic relations for @xmath12 different from eq .",
    "( [ wjw1 ] ) can be found which would lead to the same behavior of @xmath59 moments in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions , i.e. , if a solution of eq .",
    "( [ hqph ] ) can be found for some values of @xmath97 different from those given by eq .",
    "( [ wm ] ) . only then one can hope to declare an analogy between these processes .",
    "moreover , it has been found from experimental data @xcite that the amplitudes of oscillations of @xmath59 moments increase for more composite colliding particles .",
    "the anomalous fractal dimensions also differ @xcite becoming smaller for @xmath64 compared with @xmath0 and even more with @xmath1 .",
    "thus , there is no direct similarity of @xmath1 and @xmath0-collisions .",
    "to conclude , a model of independent pair parton interactions has been proposed .",
    "it is assumed that hadronic interactions proceed through independent parton - parton collisions and each of the binary collisions gives rise to a negative binomial distribution of secondary particles with the same parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting distribution is described by a weighted sum of nbds whose parameters are equal to the single collision values @xmath8 and @xmath9 multiplied by the number of pairs .",
    "thus no new adjustable parameters appear .",
    "multiple binary parton collisions are assumed to become more important as energy increases . a comparison with experimental data at 300 , 546 , 1000 , and 1800 gev has shown good agreement .",
    "predictions for the cern large hadron collider and higher energies are presented .",
    "it is demonstrated that asymptotic qcd predictions for @xmath1 multiplicity distributions differ from the asymptotic results of the ippi model for @xmath0 processes .",
    "further work on monte carlo implementation of this model is in progress .",
    "we are grateful to s. hegyi for correspondence .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the rfbr grants 02 - 02 - 16779 , 04 - 02 - 16445-a , and nsh-1936.2003.2 .",
    "is also grateful to the russian science support foundation .",
    "the ratio of the coefficients in front of the leading @xmath101 terms in @xmath99 and @xmath74 gives @xmath59 for the poisson distribution .",
    "thus , in general , @xmath59 differs from 0 for a multicomponent poisson distribution .",
