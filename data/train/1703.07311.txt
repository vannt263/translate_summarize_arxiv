    "multiferroic materials , where ferroelectricity is induced by the spiral magnetic order , have drawn huge attention recently from both condensed matter and material scientists because of their immense potential in device applications  @xcite .",
    "the main objective in this area is to design materials with high transition temperature of the spiral magnetic order . since in the non - geometrically frustrated systems , the spiral state results from competing nearest - neighbour ( j@xmath4 ) and next - nearest - neighbour exchange ( j@xmath5 ) interactions",
    "@xcite , it is desired to have high values for such interactions . however , in transition - metal oxides such interaction strengths are found to be very weak  @xcite which gives rise to low transition temperature for the magnetic spiral state .",
    "there are only two exceptions where magnetism driven ferroelectricity is observed through a stable spiral state close to the room temperature .",
    "one is cupric oxide cuo @xcite , where a spiral phase is observed at temperatures above 200k , but only in a narrow temperature window between 213k to 230 k @xcite . in this system",
    "the monoclinic symmetry with frustrating magnetic interactions and competing nn and nnn exchange interactions stabilize the magnetic spiral around room temperature .",
    "the second one is the oxygen - deficient layered perovskite ybacufeo@xmath0 ( ybcfo ) , which displays multiferroism at unexpectedly high temperatures @xcite .",
    "large , spontaneous electric polarization @xcite has been reported in the magnetic spiral phase in this system @xcite within a wide temperature range ( almost ten times of that in cuo ) at zero magnetic field .",
    "ybcfo crystallizes in tetragonal structure with @xmath6 symmetry@xcite .",
    "the structure is not geometrically frustrated . due to the similar ionic size of fe and cu it has not been possible to assign any ordering of fe / cu ions from experiments .",
    "first - principles density functional theory calculations show that the lowest energy structure , which gives rise to ( experimentally observed)ferromagnetic interactions among the bilayers , is the one which has preferential fe - cu pairs as shown in fig .",
    "1 . ybcfo undergoes two magnetic transitions @xcite .",
    "higher temperature paramagnetic ( pm ) to commensurate antiferromagnetic phase transition occurs at @xmath7 with magnetic propagation vector * * _ k@xmath8_**=@xmath9 @xcite whereas an incommensurate magnetic ordering sets in at a lower temperature below @xmath10 .",
    "the neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) data shows the appearance of incommensurate magnetic ordering below t@xmath11 along c axis with propagation vector * * _ k@xmath12_**=@xmath13 @xcite . the incommenssurate magnetic phase is also observed to be ferroelectric in nature .",
    "+ recently , it has been experimentally shown by morin et al.@xcite that controlled introduction of chemical disorder into ybcfo in the form of fe - fe or cu - cu impurity bonds can enhance the stability of magnetic spiral state further giving rise to a large increase in the transition temperature t@xmath11 beyond the room temperature . in this work ,",
    "the authors have been able to raise t@xmath11 to as high as 310k from 150k by creating small amount of impurity bonds during the preparation of the sample @xcite .",
    "subsequently , theoretical calculations based on monte - carlo simulation have shown that these impurity bonds introduce a large out of plane antiferromagnetic exchange interaction which in turn stabilizes the spiral state@xcite .    application of pressure or doping isovalent ions at the a sites also believed to have similar effect to that of chemical disorder as described above . in a very recent experimental measurements one of the authors of this work has observed the enhancement of t@xmath11 by doping ba with sr @xcite . motivated by these observations ,",
    "we theoretically investigate the effect of a site doping from first - principles dft and qmc calculations",
    ". it would be interesting to see how the nn and nnn exchange interactions evolve with the doping concentration and also how these interactions will compete with each other in order to stabilize or destabilize the commensurate and incommensurate ( spiral ) magnetic phases seen in the parent compound .",
    "in order to study the electronic properties of yba@xmath1sr@xmath2cufeo@xmath0 and estimate the various exchange interactions of the system , we have employed the first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite calculations within local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) . in our dft calculations , we have used the plane - wave and psuedopotential based method as implemented in the vienna ab-_initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "for all these calculations we have used projector augmented wave ( paw ) potentials @xcite .",
    "the wave functions were expanded in the plane - wave basis with a kinetic - energy cutoff of 600 ev .",
    "reciprocal space integration was carried out with a k - mesh of @xmath14 . in order to incorporate the electron correlation effects beyond lsda , which is important to describe proper ground states of transition metal oxides ,",
    "we have carried out lsda+u @xcite calculations with u being the on - site coulomb correlation .",
    "we considered the value of u to be 5 ev for fe and 8 ev for cu as previously used in literature .",
    "the corresponding hund s coupling strengths ( j ) were set to j@xmath15 = 1 ev and j@xmath16=0 for fe and cu , respectively @xcite .",
    "the structural parameters were taken from experiments @xcite for the parent and all the doped structures [ table 1 ] .",
    "ionic positions of each structure are then optimized keeping the lattice constants at their respective experimental values .",
    "+ we have further carried out quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) calculations using the magnetic exchange interactions estimated from our dft calculations to study the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of these systems as well as the doping dependence of paramagnetic to commensurate phase transition temperature@xcite .",
    "these calculations were performed on a @xmath17 supercell with periodic boundary condition .",
    "yba@xmath1sr@xmath2cufeo@xmath0 have the layered perovskite structure for the entire range of doping as shown in fig 1(a ) . in the tetragonal structure , two square pyramids feo@xmath18 and cuo@xmath18 are connected via apical oxygen forming a bilayer of bipyramids .",

    "these bipyramidal layers are separated by a layer of y@xmath20 ions .",

    "_ calculations we have considered a supercell with a@xmath21=@xmath22 and c@xmath21=2c ( a and c are the crystallographic unit cell parameters ) containing four formula units , as depicted in fig 1(a ) .",
    "this construction of the supercell was required to incorporate the commensurate magnetic structure depicted in fig 1(b ) . in this magnetic phase , the bipyramidal units connected via apical oxygen are preferentially occupied by cu - fe pairs and the interaction within these cu - fe dimers is ferromagnetic ( fm ) in nature . whereas cu - cu and fe - fe pairs separated by y layers are antiferromagnetically coupled .",

    "however , inter bipyramidal exchange ( cu - cu and fe - fe ) interactions remain afm in the incommensurate phase as well .",
    "recent theoretical investigations have looked into the origin of this spiral state@xcite .",
    "one option to create frustration in the unfrustrated commenssurate phase is to have a strong ferromagnetic next nearest neighbour exchange interaction ( j@xmath5 ) .",
    "however , first - principles estimation of j@xmath5 shows that the magnitude of this interaction ( when ferromagnetic ) is too small to cause enough frustration to destabilize the commensurate phase in favour of incommensurate magnetic phase @xcite .",
    "more recent reports have correlated the origin of spiral state to the inherent presence of impurity bonds ( fe - fe or cu - cu ) within the bipyramidal layers as defects .",
    "it has been shown that these impurity bonds introduce strong afm exchange interactions within the bilayer which are primarily ferromagnetic and thus creates frustration leading to the canting of spins within these bilayers . in this work",
    "we look into an alternative route to stabilization of the spiral state through a - site doping as has been observed in recent experimental measurements in sr doped ybcfo @xcite .",

    "this affects the corresponding exchange interactions as expected . as we see in fig 2(b ) ferromagnetic exchange interaction strength between fe - cu pairs ( @xmath25 ) corresponding to bilayer containing sr increases whereas the same for the bilayer not containing sr ( @xmath26 ) decreases ( fig 2(c ) ) .",
    "this trend is followed for x=0.5 case as well where sr and ba segregate into different bilayers ( see fig 2(b ) ) .",
    "the decrease of the ferromagnetic exchange interaction strength can be seen as the development of an antiferromagnetic component which could play a role in stabilizing further the spiral state .    for @xmath27",
    "when both the bilayers contain sr ions , the dependence of ( d@xmath23 ) and ( d@xmath24 ) on doping is opposite to what is observed in @xmath28 case so are the behaviour of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that at x=1.0 ( i.e. ysrcufeo@xmath0 ) the fm exchange strengths of both bilayers are equal and is slightly more than corresponding exchange strengths for x=0 ( i.e. ybacufeo@xmath0 ) .",
    "as it is being reported in the literature that the incommensurate phase is connected with the appearance of non - collinearity within the bilayers , the stabilization of fm exchange in ysrcufeo@xmath0 could imply that in this compound commensurate phase is more stable . the sole experimental report on this compound @xcite indeed shows that there is no commensurate - incommensurate phase transition in this compound .",

    "we have performed a systematic study of magnetic phase transitions in sr doped ybcfo using first principles dft and qmc calculations for the entire range of doping .",
    "the effect of replacing larger ba ions by smaller sr ions is seen to create substantial structural distortion in terms of inter- and intra bilayer separation along c direction in ybcfo which we have estimated through the structural optimization within lsda .",
    "the doping induced structural changes then affect various magnetic exchange interactions responsible for the magnetic transitions seen in these compounds in experiments .",
    "we have evaluated in plane and out of plane nn and nnn exchange interactions between fe - cu , fe - fe and cu - cu spins within lsda+u approximation for the experimentally observed commensurate magnetic structure .",
    "our results agree very well with the previous theoretical calculations of the exchange interactions for the parent compound ybcfo @xcite .",
    "we observe a strong dependence of exchange interactions on sr doping .",
    "the fe - cu exchange ( j@xmath30 ) along c direction within the bipyramidal layer separated by sr is ferromagnetic and is seen to increase with doping up to @xmath43 while the same within bipyramidal layer separated by ba ( j@xmath29 ) is seen to decrease .",
    "the reverse trend is observed in j@xmath30 and j@xmath29 in the region @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , the inter bipyramidal ( separated by y ) afm exchange couplings j@xmath34 and j@xmath33 between cu - cu and fe - fe pairs decrease continuously as we dope sr .",
    "most importantly , the next nearest neighbour exchange interaction j@xmath5 is ferromagnetic and is also seen to increase with doping up to x=0.5 even if the interaction strength is small . as the fm nnn interaction can cause frustration in the commensurate phase favouring a spiral magnetic state ,",
    "its enhancement with doping clearly indicates that the spiral state present in the parent compound will be more stabilized with sr doping at ba sites .",
    "we have also performed qmc calculations with the magnetic exchange parameters obtained from our dft calculations and calculated the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat for the entire range of doping .",
    "clear signature of magnetic transition is seen in both susceptibility and specific heat curves .",
