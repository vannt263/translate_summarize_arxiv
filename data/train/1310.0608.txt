    "as is well - known , relativistic scalar fields play the crucial roles in physics of fundamental interactions from particle physics to cosmology .",
    "topological and non - topological solitons @xcite , @xcite , long lived oscillons @xcite , phenomena such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and higgs mechanism @xcite , all can hardly be considered without scalar fields .",
    "not surprisingly , one can find in literature a whole variety of field - theoretic models with scalar fields .",
    "we have been interested in the so called signum - gordon model which involves just one classical scalar field @xmath0 , real or complex .",
    "its defining feature is the v - shaped self - interaction potential proportional to the modulus of the field , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the self - coupling constant .",
    "this model originated from investigations of perturbations of the ground state of a system of harmonically coupled pendulums bouncing from a stiff rod in the constant gravitational field @xcite .",
    "it has turned out that it has truly amazing properties .",
    "its basic dynamical features , which do not depend on the dimension of space - time , include a scale invariance of the on - shell type , and generically a very fast , parabolic approach of the field to its ground state value @xmath3 , which is reached exactly on a finite distance . because of the latter property , the signum - gordon field",
    "may formally be regarded as an ultramassive one , because the massless or massive fields have a different asymptotic behavior of coulomb or yukawa type , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in the case of real signum - gordon field the field equation has the form @xmath4 where the @xmath5 function has the standard values @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the r.h.s . of this equation is piecewise constant , greatly facilitating construction of interesting analytic solutions .",
    "in fact , its solutions include non - radiating oscillons @xcite , as well as a whole family of self - similar fields @xcite . in the case of complex scalar field with the v - shaped self - interaction compact q - balls",
    "were found @xcite . in all these cases",
    "pertinent exact analytic solutions were obtained .",
    "thus the signum - gordon model has turned out to be a very good theoretical laboratory for studying the highly nontrivial , nonlinear dynamics of scalar fields .",
    "recently , we have investigated forces exerted on static external charges interacting with the real signum - gordon field @xcite . in particular , the force @xmath8 between two identical , separated by the distance @xmath9 , point static charges of the strength @xmath10 has been calculated .",
    "it exactly vanishes when the distance between the charges exceeds certain finite value @xmath11 that depends on their strengths .",
    "such unusual behavior is due to the fact that @xmath12 remains finite even for arbitrarily small values of the field @xmath0 .",
    "this is similar to the constant gravity force attracting a ball to floor .",
    "the scalar field forms a compact cloud surrounding the charges .",
    "the force is attractive .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the work @xcite by presenting two effects that are due to nonlinearity of the signum - gordon field .",
    "the point is that in the case of one - dimensional space one can construct the exact solutions of the inhomogeneous signum - gordon equation ( eq .  ( 4 ) below ) for any number of static , point - like external sources .",
    "this gives us the rare opportunity of having full knowledge about the effects that are due to the self - interaction of the signum - gordon field ",
    "the mediating field for the forces between the external charges . specifically , we consider the force @xmath13 between two opposite static charges @xmath14 and @xmath10 separated by the distance @xmath9 , and the forces in the system of three identical static charges . we obtain exact formulas for the scalar mediating field and for the forces . in the @xmath15 case ,",
    "the field and force vanish when the distance @xmath9 exceeds the same finite value @xmath11 as in the @xmath16 system investigated in @xcite .",
    "the force is repulsive , as expected .",
    "our new finding is that the magnitudes of the forces in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 cases are different , @xmath19 , as opposed to the case of charges coupled to a free field , e.g. , electric charges interacting with the electromagnetic field .",
    "our most interesting result however is the observation that in the case of three charges a three - body force is present .",
    "it is clear that in general one should expect @xmath20-body forces when there are @xmath20 charges .",
    "these effects are due to the nonlinearity of field equation and therefore are expected to appear in other nonlinear field - theoretic models .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly recall the method of calculating the forces , we explain how one can obtain the pertinent solution of field equation , and we discuss the @xmath15 case .",
    "the three - body forces in the @xmath21 case are calculated in section 3 .",
    "summary and remarks are collected in section 4 .",
    "we consider two static , point - like charges of the opposite sign interacting with the dynamical real scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "the lagrangian for this system has the form ( we use the @xmath22 units ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 here @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the spatial coordinate in the one - dimensional space .",
    "the charges are located at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the field equation corresponding to this lagrangian reads @xmath29 the simplest way to obtain the @xmath30 term is first to regularize the field potential , e.g. , @xmath31 , and to take the limit @xmath32 in the term @xmath33 that appears in the corresponding euler - lagrange equation .",
    "thus , @xmath34 it is clear from this definition that @xmath35 .",
    "such regularized version of the signum - gordon model , i.e. , with @xmath36 , was investigated on its own right in @xcite .",
    "the force exerted on the charge @xmath14 located at @xmath27 is given by the total flux of momentum towards that charge , as explained in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the momentum density and the flux of momentum are given by the energy - momentum tensor of our system , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the minkowski metric .",
    "the total momentum @xmath39 of the field , given by @xmath40 vanishes in the case of static fields we consider .",
    "the presence of the point charges breaks the translational symmetry . in consequence , instead of",
    "the continuity equation @xmath41 we have @xmath42    the flux of momentum along the @xmath43 axis is given by @xmath44 if @xmath45 . by the definition ,",
    "the force exerted on the charge located at @xmath27 is given by the rate at which the momentum is transferred to that charge .",
    "hence , @xmath46 here @xmath47 can be any number from the interval @xmath48 , because in the static case the identity ( 6 ) implies that @xmath49 does not depend on @xmath43 in the open intervals @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , in which @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , we will see that the pertinent solution @xmath0 and @xmath49 vanish in the interval @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is a constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 , and formula ( 7 ) is simplified to @xmath57    it remains to find the field @xmath0 in the presence of the sources . in the static case",
    "it satisfies the equation @xmath58 in order to ensure finiteness of the total energy @xmath59 , where @xmath60 should vanish for @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , integrating both sides of eq .",
    "( 9 ) over intervals of the half - length @xmath62 around @xmath27 and @xmath63 we obtain the conditions @xmath64 which are the one - dimensional counterpart of gauss law of electrostatics .",
    "these conditions imply that @xmath65 is discontinuous at the locations of the charges .",
    "obvious approach to solving eq .",
    "( 9 ) is first to find solutions of the homogeneous equation @xmath66 in the open intervals @xmath67 @xmath51 and @xmath68 .",
    "next , we glue them at @xmath27 , @xmath63 , so that @xmath0 is continuous function of @xmath43 at these points , and that the conditions ( 10 ) , in which we may take the limit @xmath69 , are satisfied .    the general solution of eq .",
    "( 11 ) in the interval in which @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 , has the form @xmath72 and if @xmath73 then @xmath74 where @xmath75 are constants to be determined from the matching conditions .",
    "there also exists the trivial solution @xmath3 which represents the ground state of the classical signum - gordon field .",
    "our ansatz for the solution has the following form @xmath76 , \\\\",
    "u_2(x )   & \\;\\;\\ ; x \\in [ 0 , d_1 ] , \\\\",
    "u_3(x )   & \\;\\;\\ ; x \\in [ d_1 , a ] , \\\\",

    "the functions @xmath79 are negative inside their domains and have the form ( 13 ) , while @xmath80 are positive and have the form ( 12 ) , see fig .",
    "1 .     case , width=453,height=113 ]    the function @xmath81 matches the ground state solution @xmath3 at the point @xmath82 .",
    "the matching conditions are the continuity of @xmath0 and @xmath83 .",
    "trivial calculation gives @xmath84    the function @xmath85 obeys the conditions @xmath86 simple calculations give @xmath87 and the relation @xmath88    the function @xmath89 has the general form ( 12 ) with the coefficients @xmath90 determined from the conditions @xmath91 , @xmath92 , which ensure the correct matching of @xmath89 with the trivial solution @xmath3 at the point @xmath93 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath94    the function @xmath95 of the general form ( 12 ) has to obey four conditions : the matching conditions with the function @xmath85 at the point @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and the conditions @xmath99 , @xmath100 at the point @xmath63 .",
    "these conditions determine the precise form of @xmath95 , namely @xmath101 and also give the following relations @xmath102 these relations together with ( 17 ) fix the constants @xmath103 : @xmath104    the force exerted on the charge @xmath14 located at @xmath27 is given by formula ( 8) , in which we put @xmath105 .",
    "simple calculation gives @xmath106 where @xmath107 we see that the force is repulsive one .",
    "it contains the one - dimensional scalar coulomb force @xmath108 as the leading term when @xmath109 .",
    "the solution ( 14 ) and formula ( 22 ) for the force are valid when @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "when the distance @xmath9 between the charges is equal to @xmath111 the charges become completely screened by the scalar field . when @xmath112 , each charge is surrounded by a compact cloud of the field of the width @xmath111 .",
    "the clouds do not overlap  in between them there is the region with the ground state field @xmath3 .",
    "thus the charges do not feel the presence of each other , and the force vanishes of course .",
    "such screening has been observed already in @xcite in the case of two identical point - like charges @xmath17 located at @xmath27 and @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the force exerted on the charge located at @xmath27 is given by the following formula @xmath113 apart from the difference in sign , which means that @xmath114 is an attractive force , we see different dependence on the distance @xmath9 .",
    "because this difference disappears when we put the coupling constant @xmath115 , it is related to the presence of the nonlinear @xmath116 term in the field equation ( 4 ) .",
    "let us now consider three identical point charges of the strength @xmath10 located at the points @xmath117 , @xmath27 and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 . in this case eq .",
    "( 4 ) takes the form @xmath120 the ansatz for the solution has the form @xmath121 , \\\\",
    "w_2(x )   & \\;\\;\\ ; x \\in [ -a , 0 ] , \\\\",
    "w_3(x )   & \\;\\;\\ ; x \\in [ 0 , b ] , \\\\",
    "w_4(x )   & \\;\\;\\ ; x \\in [ b , b+d_+],\\\\ 0 & \\;\\;\\ ; x \\geq b+d_+ , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath122 are constants .",
    "all functions @xmath123 , @xmath124 , are strictly positive inside their domains , so they have the general form ( 12 ) . the nontrivial part of the function @xmath125 is depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "the constants in these functions and the constants @xmath126 are determined from the matching conditions which ensure continuity of @xmath127 everywhere and continuity of @xmath128 at @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and from the ` gauss law ' relations of the type ( 10 ) at @xmath117 , @xmath27 , @xmath118 .",
    "because the pertinent calculations are straightforward and completely analogous to the ones presented in the -qq case , we just quote the results : @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath135    the solution ( 25 ) is correct provided that @xmath9 and @xmath136 are not too large , otherwise one charge ( or more ) will be completely screened by the compact cloud of the scalar field , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "such a screened charge decouples from the others . in such cases , in between the clouds",
    "there are segments of the @xmath43 axis where the field has its ground state value @xmath3 , and the force on such a distant charge exactly vanishes .",
    "more precisely , for the validity of the solution ( 25 ) @xmath9 and @xmath136 should satisfy the following bounds @xmath137 the decoupling of the charge located at @xmath117 from the two other occurs when @xmath138 . this can be found by checking when the function @xmath139 has a zero in the interval @xmath140 .",
    "if @xmath141 in that interval , the function ( 25 ) ceases to be the solution of eq .",
    "the decoupling of the charge located at @xmath118 takes place when @xmath142 . in this case",
    "one should check positivity of the @xmath143 function .",
    "it is clear from the considerations at the beginning of section 2 that the total force exerted on the charge located at @xmath117 is given by the formula @xmath144 this force is the attractive one .",
    "let us compare this force with the sum of two - body forces exerted on this charge by the charges located at @xmath27 and @xmath118 .",
    "for the two - body forces we use formula ( 23 ) assuming that @xmath145 , @xmath146 , so that our charge is in the interaction range of the two other charges .",
    "we obtain @xmath147 the difference @xmath148 gives the three - body component of the total force exerted on that charge .",
    "this component is negligibly small if @xmath109 , @xmath149 ( when the constant scalar coulomb force dominates ) , but it can not be neglected if the distances between the charges become comparable with @xmath111 .",
    "the force exerted on the charge located at @xmath27 also has a three - body component .",
    "the total force is calculated from the formula @xmath150 on the other hand , the sum of two - body forces exerted by the neighboring charges is equal to @xmath151 here we assume that @xmath152 , so that the use of formula ( 23 ) is formally justified .",
    "again , the three - body component , @xmath153 can have a sizable magnitude .",
    "the force exerted on the charge located at @xmath118 is given by the formula @xmath154 it differs from the force @xmath155 by the sign , and @xmath9 and @xmath136 are interchanged , as expected in view of the spatial structure of our @xmath156 system .",
    "\\1 . we have found the exact form of the scalar field in the presence of two and three point - like external charges in one dimensional space . for simplicity",
    ", we have considered the @xmath18 and @xmath156 systems , but a generalization to charges of arbitrary strength is straightforward .",
    "the fields have the parabolic , compact tails that are characteristic for models with the v - shaped self - interactions .",
    "next , we have calculated the forces exerted on the charges .",
    "our main finding is that the forces are shaped mainly by the self - coupling of the mediating field . only at the very short distances ( @xmath157 ) the familiar scalar coulomb force dominates , and",
    "the self - interaction of the field is not important .",
    "particularly interesting is the presence of the three - body force .",
    "generalizing our result , we expect that in a system of @xmath20 particles coupled to a non - linear field all @xmath158-body forces will appear with @xmath159 .",
    "we have seen that the three - body force can have a significant strength .",
    "this would cast a shadow on attempts to model dynamics of many particle systems by hamiltonians that include only two - particle interactions .",
    "the importance of the many - body forces has recently been emphasized in , e.g. , @xcite in the context of nuclear physics , and in @xcite in condensed matter physics .",
    "it is clear that nonlinear field - theoretic effects in interactions of systems of many particles are in general present and important . as a good illustration of this point one",
    "may take the results presented in @xcite , where an explanation of rotation curves of galaxies without invoking the concept of dark matter is proposed .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate the many - body forces in the case of particles coupled to a non - abelian gauge field of the @xmath160 type .",
