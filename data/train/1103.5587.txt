    "is lorentz symmetry truly fundamental ? or is it just an  accidental \" low - momentum emergent symmetry ?",
    "opinions on this issue have undergone a radical mutation over the last few years .",
    "historically , ( for good experimental and theoretical reasons ) , lorentz symmetry was considered absolutely fundamental  not to be trifled with  but for a number of independent reasons the modern viewpoint is more nuanced .    * first , there is now a well developed phenomenological framework that permits precision tests of lorentz invariance .",
    "( see for instance  @xcite . )",
    "while all observational data to date are compatible with exact lorentz invariance , the existence of this theoretical framework shows that at least some ( limited ) types of lorentz symmetry breaking are compatible with current observations . *",
    "second , there are very many and varied theoretical scenarios that suggest ( but do not unavoidably guarantee ) that at sufficiently high energies ( typically trans - planckian energies ) lorentz symmetry might eventually break down .",
    "( see for instance  @xcite . )",
    "faced with this theoretical situation it makes very good sense to ask :    * what if anything are the benefits of lorentz symmetry breaking ? * what can we do with it ? *",
    "why should we care ?",
    "* where are the bodies buried ?    in this regard , one of the more significant developments of the last decade was the appearance in early 2009 of a paper by  @xcite which laid out a strategy for making a virtue of lorentz symmetry breaking by _ using _ it as a key ingredient in developing a superficially plausible quantum field theoretic candidate for a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "s model is not a string theory , nor loop quantum gravity , but is instead a traditional ( point - particle ) quantum field theory that breaks lorentz invariance at ultra - high ( presumably trans - planckian ) energies .",
    "since the mere existence of any such field - theoretic model ( independent of its actual phenomenological viability ) flew in the face of much of the `` perceived wisdom '' regarding the features one might reasonably expect of any realistic theory of `` quantum gravity '' , there was very rapid and extremely extensive interest in  s proposal .",
    "as of march 2011 , s original paper  @xcite has been cited over 425 times , with some 65% of the citing articles being published . if we add the closely related articles  @xcite this rises to some 450 articles , with again some 65% of the citing articles being published .",
    "this is indicative of a very highly active research field . on the other hand",
    ", there is at least one note of caution that should be raised : the unpublished 35% of citing articles can not all be attributed simply to time - lag , nor to non - journal conference - proceedings articles .",
    "the two main reasons underlying this state of affairs seem to be :    * there has been somewhat of a tendency to charge full steam ahead with applications , ( typically cosmological ) , without first fully understanding the foundations of the model . * for that matter , there is still considerable disagreement as to what precise version of s model is `` best '' .    consequently , when reading the relevant literature , a certain amount of caution is advisable . in the current article",
    "i will give a rather personal interpretation of the current state of affairs in gravity , with some indications of possible future directions .",
    "my interpretation of the central idea of gravity is this : one abandons ultra - high - energy lorentz invariance as fundamental , recognizing that phenomenologically one need `` merely '' attempt to recover an approximate low - energy lorentz invariance .",
    "typical dispersion relations are then of the form @xmath0 this point of view is nicely compatible with the `` analogue spacetime '' programme  @xcite , which is one reason i personally was very quick to get involved . more precisely , in condensed matter language , a so - called `` critical '' lifshitz point in @xmath1 dimensions corresponds to a dispersion relation which satisfies @xmath2 to recover lorentz invariance , at `` low '' momentum ( but still allowing @xmath3 ) the dispersion relation should satisfy @xmath4 note that every quantum field theory ( qft ) regulator currently known to mankind either breaks lorentz invariance explicitly ( e.g.  lattice qft ) , or does something worse , often something outright unphysical . for example : pauli  villars violates unitarity ; lorentz - invariant higher - derivatives violate unitarity ; dimensional regularization is at best a purely formal trick with no direct physical interpretation ( and which requires a zen - like approach to gamma matrix algebra ) .",
    "the standard viewpoint is this : if the main goal is efficient computation in a corner of parameter space that we experimentally know to be lorentz invariant to a high level of precision , then by all means , go ahead and develop a lorentz - invariant perturbation theory with an unphysical regulator  hopefully the unphysical aspects of the computation can first be isolated , and then banished by renormalization .",
    "this is exactly what is done , ( very efficiently and very effectively ) , in the `` standard model of particle physics '' .",
    "( see for instance  @xcite . )",
    "s approach can be interpreted by taking on a non - standard viewpoint : if one has reason to suspect that lorentz invariance might ultimately break down at ultra - high ( presumably trans ",
    "planckian ) energies , then a different strategy suggests itself .",
    "maybe one could _ use _ the lorentz symmetry breaking as part of the qft regularization procedure ?",
    "could we then at least keep intermediate parts of the qft calculation `` physical '' ? ( note that `` physical '' does not necessarily mean `` realistic '' , it just means we are not violating fundamental tenets of quantum physics at intermediate stages of the calculation . )",
    "consider for example a specific `` physical '' but lorentz - violating regulator based on the dispersion relation @xmath5 we call this a `` trans  bogoliubov '' dispersion relation  @xcite , based on analogy with the standard condensed - matter bogoliubov dispersion relation : @xmath6 the corresponding qft propagator ( momentum - space green function ) is @xmath7}.\\ ] ] note the rapid fall - off as spatial momentum @xmath8 .",
    "this improves the behaviour of the integrals encountered in feynman diagram calculations ( qft perturbation theory ) .",
    "specifically : in any ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional scalar qft , with arbitrary polynomial self - interaction , this is enough ( after wick rotation and normal ordering ) , to keep all individual feynman diagrams _",
    "finite_. for details see  @xcite , the original article  @xcite , and related work by anselmi  @xcite .",
    "more generally , with language again borrowed from condensed matter , for a lifshitz point of order @xmath9 in @xmath1 dimensions we have the dispersion relation : @xmath10 the equivalent qft propagator [ green function ] is now @xmath11}.\\ ] ] key theoretical results are that :    * in a @xmath1 dimensional scalar qft with @xmath12 , and arbitrary polynomial self - interaction , this is enough ( after wick rotation and normal ordering ) to keep all feynman diagrams individually _ finite _  @xcite . * gravity is a little trickier , but you can at least argue for power - counting renormalizability of the resulting qft  @xcite .",
    "these results are unexpected , seriously unexpected . and yes , there are still significant technical difficulties , ( of which more anon ) .",
    "consider the standard adm decomposition for @xmath1 dimensional gravity : @xmath13 - \\tr[k]^2 + { } ^{(d ) } r \\right\\ } \\;\\ ; \\d^{d } x\\ ; \\d t}.\\ ] ] here one has split spacetime into space+time , while @xmath14 is intrinsic curvature of space , and @xmath15 is the extrinsic curvature of space in spacetime . on the one hand this adm decomposition leads to `` canonically quantized gravity '' ( with all its problems ) , and on the other hand it is classically very useful for numerical relativity .",
    "the key to gravity is now to develop a non - standard extension of the adm formalism :    * choose a `` preferred foliation '' . *",
    "decompose @xmath16 . *",
    "add extra `` kinetic '' and `` potential '' terms , beyond what you expect from einstein  hilbert .",
    "* you can not now reassemble @xmath17 into a simple @xmath18 .",
    "* you have now implicitly reintroduced the aether , more on this below .    specifically :    * consider the `` kinetic energy '' @xmath19 noting that standard general relativity would enforce @xmath20 , ( that is @xmath21 ) .",
    "take the kinetic action to be @xmath22 this contains only two time derivatives ( hiding in @xmath15 )  this is good , and is necessary ( though not by itself sufficient ) to suppress ghosts .",
    "* there is also a hidden `` scalar graviton '' when @xmath23  this is potentially very bad , and i will have much more to say on this below .",
    "* now consider the most general `` potential energy '' in @xmath1 dimensions : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is some scalar built out of the spatial metric and the lapse function , and their spatial derivatives .",
    "it is roughly at this stage that hoava makes his two great simplifications :    * detailed balance . *",
    "projectability .    even after almost two years",
    "it is still somewhat unclear whether these are _ only _ `` simplifying ansatz '' or whether they are in some sense fundamental to hoava s model . in particular , thomas sotiriou , silke weinfurtner , and i have argued that `` detailed balance '' is not fundamental  @xcite , and we have been carefully thinking about the issue of `` projectability '' .

    "in particular , if you assume hoava s detailed balance , and try to recover the einstein ",
    "hilbert action in the low - energy regime , then :    * you are forced to accept a non - zero cosmological constant of the wrong sign .",
    "* you are forced to accept intrinsic parity violation in the purely gravitational sector .",
    "now the second item i could live with , albeit uncomfortably , ( observationally there is not the slightest hint of parity violation in gravitational physics ) , but dealing with the the first item will require some mutilation of detailed balance anyway , so we might as well go the whole way and discard detailed balance entirely .",

    "@xmath29 in standard general relativity the `` projectability condition '' can always be enforced locally as a gauge choice .",
    "furthermore for `` physically interesting '' solutions of general relativity it seems that this can always be done ( more or less ) globally .",
    "for instance :    * for the schwarzschild spacetime this `` projectability condition '' holds globally in painlev  gullstrand coordinates . * for the reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime this `` projectability condition '' holds for @xmath30 in painlev  gullstrand coordinates , ( which covers the physically interesting region of the spacetime down to some point deep inside the inner horizon ) .",
    "* for the kerr spacetime this condition holds globally ( for the physically interesting chronology respecting @xmath31 region ) in doran coordinates .",
    "( so that the geometry is `` projectable '' down to some point deep inside the inner horizon ) .",
    "* the flrw cosmologies also automatically satisfy this `` projectability condition '' .    for this purely pragmatic reason we decided to put `` projectability '' off to one side for a while , and first deal with `` detailed balance ''  @xcite",
