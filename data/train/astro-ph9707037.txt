    "it is now well established that orbital velocity increases strongly with galaxy luminosity in giant galaxies of all hubble types .",
    "this relationship is embodied in the tully  fisher ( tully & fisher 1977 ) relationship for spiral and irregular galaxies , and the fundamental plane ( dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) for elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges ( dressler 1988 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ; hereafter @xmath13 ) .    in @xmath13 we developed a new way of viewing the structural properties of dynamically hot galaxies ( hereafter dhgs ) by making an orthogonal rotation of the global parameter space defined by velocity dispersion ( @xmath7 ) , effective radius ( @xmath14 ) and mean effective surface brightness within @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this rotation leads to a new coordinate system that we named `` @xmath0-space '' and which provides face - on and edge - on views of the dhg fundamental plane .",
    "the axes of @xmath0-space are logarithmically related to galaxy mass , mass - to - light ratio , and a third quantity that depends primarily on surface brightness ( the @xmath0 parameters are defined in   [ dat-2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath0-space is a useful diagnostic tool for visualizing the physical properties of dhgs .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether an analogous plot for other hubble types , and even galaxy groups and clusters , could be similarly informative .",
    "earlier discussions of the relationships among the physical properties of stellar systems concentrated on scaling relationships between just two parameters at a time .",
    "examples are the tully  fisher ( tf ) relation for spirals and the faber ",
    "jackson ( 1976 ) relation for ellipticals : @xmath16 .",
    "we now understand that , for elliptical galaxies , @xmath16 is just one projection of what is inherently a two - dimensional family , the fundamental plane ( fp ) .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that the tf relation is a similar projection for spiral and irregular galaxies , but this has not yet been shown explicitly . if there is a fp for spirals and irregulars , what is its relation to the dhg fp , and how do the various hubble types distribute themselves within it ?",
    "the various scaling relations for stellar systems provide a test for theories of structure formation in the the universe .",
    "faber ( 1982a , b ) and blumenthal et al .",
    "( 1984 ; hereafter bfpr ) , among others , examined the projected distributions of galaxies and clusters onto the ( density , velocity ) and ( mass , velocity ) planes and compared them to the predictions of hierarchical clustering theory .",
    "the distributions of rich galaxy clusters ( schaeffer et al . 1993 ) and globular clusters ( djorgovski 1995 ) were examined in standard fp space .",
    "these latter were found to form planes nearly parallel to the dhg fp .    despite these individual investigations ,",
    "there still has not been a unified survey of all types of self - gravitating , equilibrium stellar systems in the three - dimensional space of their fundamental structural parameters . in this paper",
    "we assemble the necessary database to provide such a survey .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was presented in burstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ; hereafter @xmath17 ) . here",
    "we describe how our homogeneous and self - consistent data set has been assembled and how the structures of the major groups of self - gravitating stellar systems fit together in @xmath0-space .",
    "we discuss how their overall distribution can be interpreted in terms of hierarchical clustering theory .",
    "a parallel goal of this effort is to make available a benchmark data set against which the success of models for structure formation in the universe can be judged . finally , our catalog of local structural parameters is a foil for similar structures at high redshift , for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the evolution of structure in the universe using the lookback effect .",
    "the database contains the most familiar self - gravitating , virialized or nearly - virialized systems in the nearby universe , including galaxies , globular clusters , groups of galaxies , and large clusters of galaxies .",
    "however , rare types of galaxies are missing or underrepresented , e.g. starburst h ii galaxies ( e.g. , salzer et al .",
    "1989 ; gallego et al .",
    "1996 ) , compact , narrow emission line galaxies ( koo et al . 1994 ) and very low surface brightness galaxies ( e.g. , mcgaugh 1996 ; dalcanton 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the true volume populated by galaxies in @xmath0-space is likely to be more extended to both lower and higher surface brightnesses than shown here .",
    "our galaxy sample is also approximately magnitude - limited , so that the number density versus position in @xmath0-space is not an accurate picture of the local volume densities of galaxies .",
    "even with these shortcomings , the present data are a useful first overview of the properties of common structures in the nearby universe",
    ".    definitions of @xmath0-space parameters are reviewed in ",
    "[ dat ] and explicitly equated to typical galaxy parameters such as mass , radius and luminosity in appendix  [ app-1 ] . in   [ kap1 ]",
    "we develop a more appropriate way ( than used in @xmath17 ) to intercompare the properties of galaxies of different morphological types , as well as to homogenize the properties of galaxy groups , galaxy clusters and globular clusters .",
    "  [ kapgal ] is a picture gallery that shows , in various projections , how different types of galaxies are distributed within @xmath0-space .",
    "the @xmath0-space distributions of galaxy groups , galaxy clusters and globular clusters are compared to those of galaxies in   [ kapgp ] , and tested with n - body models in appendix  [ app-2 ] . in   [ kaphcm ]",
    "we discuss how these data accord with the current picture of hierarchical structure formation in the universe .",
    "our results are summarized in   [ kapconcl ] .",
    "following @xmath13 , we choose to define the photometric parameters of stellar systems using the b passband .",
    "this choice is dictated by the large database of available b photometry .",
    "it would clearly be valuable to see how these properties relate in another passband , particularly one less sensitive to stellar population age such as near - infrared k. unfortunately , the data do not yet exist to do so , nor are they likely to appear soon in the quantity currently available for b - band data .    the global structure of self - gravitating , equilibrium stellar systems can be characterized by three parameters : size , surface brightness , and internal orbital velocity .",
    "we use the photometric data to measure the radius containing half the luminosity ( the effective radius , @xmath14 ) and the mean surface brightness within this effective radius ( @xmath15 ) . as a measure of orbital velocity we use the _ one - dimensional central _ velocity dispersion ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this is arbitrary , as arguments could be made to use the mean velocity dispersion within the effective radius for galaxy clusters , say , or mean rotation speed for spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "our choice of central velocity dispersion follows the convention of @xmath13 , but we will need to generate this parameter from other types of orbital velocity measurements ( see below ) .",
    "this section presents the basic sources of initial data . in   [ kap1 ]",
    "we discuss how the data are placed onto a common system .",
    "the @xmath0-space parameters are defined as follows :    @xmath19    @xmath20    and    @xmath21    the quantity @xmath18 is the central velocity dispersion in km s@xmath22 . as in @xmath13 , @xmath14 is measured in kpc , while @xmath15 is measured in units of b - band solar luminosities pc@xmath23 , computed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mean b - band surface brightness in b mag arcsec@xmath23 within @xmath14 .    in",
    "many cases it useful to have convenient transformations between the @xmath0 parameters and such typical parameters for stellar systems such as mass , luminosity , size , mass - to - light ratio , etc . in the present paper",
    "we use such transformations in many ways , in order to interpret the properties of stellar sytems . as such , in appendix  [ app-1 ] we give the equations that transform the @xmath0 parameters to these common parameters , including all the other parameters we employ in this paper .      distances for galaxies , galaxy groups and galaxy clusters are determined using local group radial velocities and an assumed smooth hubble flow with @xmath26 km sec@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 ( cf .",
    "@xmath13 ) . in adopting this prescription we are purposefully ignoring real peculiar motions , as these motions",
    "would currently have to be derived from the very physical properties of the stellar systems we wish to study .",
    "this approach is adequate as our goal is to discuss the physical relationships among stellar systems in broad - brush strokes .",
    "distances for ellipticals , bulges and dwarf ellipticals are based on their group or individual radial velocities as tabulated by faber et al . (",
    "1989 ) and @xmath13 .",
    "most spiral and irregular galaxy distances are based on individual local group radial velocities as given in de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 , hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "there are three exceptions to the use of a smooth hubble flow and local group radial velocities .",
    "fifteen spirals and all dhgs whose radial velocities and structural properties place them in the virialized parts of virgo or coma are given the distances of their respective clusters .",
    "the virgo cluster distance is assumed to be 20.7 mpc ( based on an assumed local group velocity for the cluster of 1035 km sec@xmath22 ) .",
    "the coma cluster distance is as in @xmath27 , 137.9 mpc , based on a local group velocity of 6,895 km sec@xmath22 .",
    "local group dhgs are given distances as in @xmath13 .",
    "local group spiral and irregular galaxies are put either at the generally  accepted distance of m31 ( 0.7 mpc ) or of m33 ( 1 mpc ) .",
    "globular cluster distances in our galaxy are determined from the v mag of the horizontal branch , as listed by peterson ( 1993 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 parameters for dhgs with measures of internal orbital anisotropy are given in @xmath13 .",
    "the reader is referred to that paper for details .",
    "the present catalog contains 292 additional elliptical galaxies from faber et al .",

    "we also exclude three sa galaxies ( ugc 1344 , ngc 4424 and ngc 7232 ) for which the tabulated values of @xmath34 are apparently in error ( too low ) .",
    "this leaves 511 galaxies of hubble types sa through i m .    to derive mean effective surface brightness and radius",
    "we have corrected the rc3 values of circular effective aperture size ( @xmath37 ) and mean surface brightness within @xmath37 ( termed @xmath38 in the rc3 ) using the axial - ratio - based statistical relationships defined in the rc3 .",
    "in addition , the surface brightnesses of all spiral galaxies have been corrected for galactic extinction and for internal extinction by subtracting 1.5 log ( @xmath33 ) mag .",
    "this is an average correction taken from the rc3 analysis .",
    "the inclination - based corrections to translate @xmath37 and @xmath39 to @xmath14 and @xmath15 are typically small ( 0.04 dex and 0.08 dex respectively for log ( @xmath33 ) = 0.4 ) .",
    "internal extinction corrections are larger ( @xmath40 mag ) for a range of inclinations corresponding to log ( @xmath33 ) = 0.4 to 0.8 .",
    "the internal corrections for extinction correct the galaxy to face - on .",
    "the effective photometric parameters for spiral galaxies from the rc3 are affected by errors in axial ratio , @xmath37 and @xmath39 , which combine to produce errors of order @xmath410.1 dex in @xmath14 and @xmath25 .",
    "since such errors dwarf either k - corrections ( @xmath420.04 dex ) or cosmological corrections , ( @xmath420.03 dex to @xmath25 ) , we choose not to make these further corrections for the spiral galaxy data .",
    "as we will see , errors of 0.1 dex have no effect on our conclusions .",
    "in addition to the rc3 data , @xmath0 parameters are derived for two large , low surface brightness spiral galaxies identified by impey & bothun ( 1989 ; malin 1 ) and by bothun et al .",

    "b - band surface brightness ( to derive @xmath15 ) is obtained by correcting both @xmath58 and @xmath57 for reddening and extinction using @xmath60 .",

    "clusters are excluded that have poor observational data for both quantities , as these are seen to scatter more within @xmath0-space .",
    "the definition of @xmath14 as the radius encompassing half the light is standard for all galaxy types and globular clusters and is straightforwardly extended to galaxy groups and clusters ( see above ) .",
    "ideally , we would wish that our values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 referred to the _ total _ baryonic mass distribution , not just that of the stars , but by using b - band light we are ignoring all non - stellar baryons . for dwarf irregular galaxies ,",
    "b - band @xmath14 values are likely to underestimate the baryonic half - mass radius since many such galaxies have extended h  i gas distributions ( e.g. ddo  154 , krumm & burstein 1984 ) .",

    "1996 ) . as the x - ray gas appears to be more extended than the galaxies ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 ) , this could lead to underestimation of baryonic values of @xmath14 for these stellar systems by 2050% , and underestimation of baryonic surface density by up to a factor of 3 .    even for stars ,",
    "the b band is susceptible to perturbing effects .",
    "b - band parameters are reasonably consistent for dhgs , globular clusters , and e - dominated groups and clusters , but the light of spiral and irregular galaxies ( and spiral - dominated groups / clusters ) is strongly perturbed by dust and young stars . while we might attempt to correct @xmath15 between spirals and dhgs for stellar population - related mass - to - light differences , we choose not to do so for two reasons .",
    "first , the range of stellar populations among spirals of similar hubble type is nearly as large as that between spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies ( burstein 1982 ) .",
    "second , models of stellar populations ( worthey 1994 ) indicate that such corrections typically change @xmath3 in the b passband by @xmath62 , leading to @xmath2 errors of less than 0.3 dex .",
    "the presence of the above systematic trends and omissions is clearly evident in the data , most obviously in values of @xmath3 for different types of objects .",
    "however , present knowledge does not permit us to account for these effects in any reliable way . to compile the survey",
    ", we prefer to stay firmly rooted in a well defined and internally consistent database ( b - band photometry ) and leave such corrections to the future .",
    "the most difficult parameter to define homogeneously for different types of stellar systems is characteristic internal velocity . in keeping with our philosophy",
    ", we would like to define a velocity that is simply related to a system s mass .",
    "this @xmath63 would combine with @xmath14 to yield a mass that is consistently measured for all stellar systems .",
    "how to define such a @xmath63 is not clear , but we can operationally define transformations among common velocity systems to bring them reasonably close onto the same system .",
    ".for the present sample , there are three kinds of characteristic velocities : i ) @xmath18 , the central velocity dispersion , used for giant e galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies ( @xmath13 ) ; ii ) @xmath52 , the velocity dispersion near within @xmath14 , used for globular clusters , galaxy groups and galaxy clusters ; and iii ) @xmath34 , the maximum circular rotation velocity for disk galaxies . @xmath18 and @xmath52 are line - of - sight , 1-d measures of dispersion , which is correlated with the local profile slope as well as mass , whereas @xmath34 relates mainly to enclosed mass alone .",
    "the goal is to identify relationships among these three parameters that will , on average , permit us to transform one measurement into another to an accuracy of @xmath64 dex .",
    "two such transformations are needed : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where the task is to estimate the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath52 and @xmath18 is known for king ( 1966 ) and jaffe ( 1983 ) models ( appendix a of @xmath13 ; chapter 4 in binney & tremaine 1987 ) . a reasonable compromise ( @xmath69% )",
    "is @xmath70 , yielding @xmath71 dex .",
    "we assume that globular clusters and galaxy groups and clusters obey king - jaffe models .",
    "the additive corrections to be applied to the @xmath0 parameters from this correction are small : @xmath72 dex , @xmath73 dex , and @xmath74 dex .",
    "should we also consider making a correction for anisotropy in the velocity dispersion ? before doing so , one should recognize that there are really two kinds of anisotropy .",
    "one is _ x  y  z _ anisotropy , which leads to a range of flattenings and triaxialities as , for example , in luminous e galaxies ( @xmath27 ) . the other is determined by the ratio of radial - to - tangential orbital motions .",
    "these two anisotropies can coexist in the same object .",
    "fortunately , it seems that _ x  y  z _ anisotropy is benign in @xmath0-space , as shown by the fact that apparent galaxy ellipticity plays a negligible role in the scatter of dhgs relative to the fundamental plane ( cf .",
    "saglia , bender & dressler 1992 ; jrgensen , franx & kjaergaard 1996 ) .",
    "little information is available on radial - to - tangential anisotropy , but hot systems that formed via violent relaxation should not be strongly radially anisotropic at the 10% level of accuracy needed here .",
    "hence we make no corrections for either type of anisotropy to the velocity dispersions of dhgs .",
    "for spiral and irregular galaxies with exponential freeman ( 1970 ) disks and central surface brightnesses equal to 21.65 b mag arcsec@xmath23 , the effective radius occurs at 23.47 b mag arcsec@xmath23 . among galaxies with central surface brightnesses within 1  mag arcsec@xmath23 of this value , most objects have reached their observed maximum rotation velocity by @xmath14 or are close to it",

    "as noted in @xmath13 , isotropic dhg galaxies ( mostly lower - luminosity ges ) tend to be found in a narrow strip in @xmath0-space parallel to the @xmath5 axis and with boundaries @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) and 4.3 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "interestingly , among the 511 spiral galaxies in our sample , only 21 galaxies , all of hubble type sdm or irr , lie more than 0.2 dex to the low mass side of this range , and only 4 spiral galaxies lie 0.2 dex or more to the high side .",
    "in other words , nearly all disk galaxies lie in the same mass range as the _ isotropic _ dhgs .",

    "it is the systematic variation in @xmath3 as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath138 for the different hubble types that creates the multiple fundamental planes .    if we derive a three parameter , `` fp  like '' fit for the spiral and irregular galaxies we get @xmath143 for the whole sample , with coefficients ( 0.85@xmath1040.05 , 0.57@xmath1040.03 ) for spirals sa - sc , and ( 0.54@xmath1040.03 , 0.34@xmath1040.02 for late - type galaxies .",

    "the @xmath0-space distribution of globular clusters is more line - like than that of any other stellar system .",
    "many formation mechanisms have been suggested for globular clusters , including collapse from primordial fluctuations ( peebles & dicke 1968 ; rosenblatt et al .",
    "1988 ) , cooling flow thermal instabilities ( fall & rees 1985 ) , merger - induced shocks ( holtzman et al . 1992",
    "; ashman & zepf 1992 ) , and molecular cloud collapse within galaxies ( searle & zinn 1978 ) . evidence from detailed examination of galactic globular clusters suggests that , regardless of formation mechanism , only those clusters with long evaporation times and large perigalacticon distances survive today . evaporation and potential shocking whittle away at an initial distribution , selecting as survivors only those clusters within a narrow range of _ radii _ ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 )",
    "this is consistent with the distribution of globular clusters in figure  11 , which is elongated and tilted with a zero point that corresponds to the predicted radius of 1 - 10 pc ( cf .",
    "figure  15 ) .",
    "we turn now to a comparison of the topology of stellar systems in @xmath0-space with the predictions of structure formation by hierarchical clustering",
    ". figure  11 can be summarized by saying that the @xmath0-space distributions of common stellar systems are viewed mostly edge - on in @xmath1@xmath2 , mostly face - on in @xmath1@xmath5 , and at intermediate angles in @xmath5@xmath2 .",
    "each kind of stellar system defines a slightly different fp in this diagram , though they are all related .",
    "we suggest the term _ cosmic metaplane _ for this ensemble of continuous interlocking , and mainly parallel fundamental planes .",
    "in retrospect , the existence of the metaplane is not surprising .",
    "we know from dhgs that any constraint of the form @xmath147 will force a plane that is edge - on in @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the existence of the metaplane reflects the empirical fact that @xmath3 is closely constrained by an object s mass . in the case of galaxies , this implies the known fact that galaxies of a similar hubble type and size make stars in similar fashion . in the case of galaxy clusters",
    ", we can now add an additional requirement that clusters of a given mass have similar stellar baryon fractions .",
    "the physics behind these constraints is still unknown , especially the physics of star formation .",
    "however , the net result is that @xmath3 varies by at most 100 over a mass range of 10@xmath148 m@xmath92 , and the range in @xmath3 at any given mass is less than 10 .",
    "it is this weak overall variation and local tightness in @xmath3 that creates the metaplane .",
    "however , for the purpose of understanding structure formation , the face - on view of the metaplane as seen in @xmath1@xmath5 is more useful than the edge - on view in @xmath1@xmath2 because of the information it contains on radii and densities .",
    "it is clear from figure  11 that the properties of galaxies and clusters are highly organized and interrelated in @xmath1@xmath5 , and there appears to be a wealth of information on how structure formed . in this section",
    "we consider the distribution of objects in @xmath1@xmath5 in light of the prevailing paradigm for structure formation involving hierarchical clustering and merging ( hereafter hcm ) .",
    "the present comparison to data is similar to the approach taken by bfpr , expanded to the full 3-d @xmath0-space and incorporating our newer and more extensive database for galaxies and clusters .",
    "the top hat spherical dissipationless collapse model for fluctuations is assumed ( gott & rees 1975 ) .",
    "if the fractional overdensity of a spherical fluctuation in a sphere of mass @xmath4 is @xmath149 at redshift @xmath150 , then the equilibrium radius of the collapsed dark halo formed from this fluctuation is ( faber 1983 ) :    @xmath151    where @xmath152 is the mass in units of @xmath153 m@xmath154 .",
    "this expression contains two independent parameters , @xmath155 and @xmath152 , which , when varied , generate a two - dimensional family of collapsed objects that populate the _ cosmic virial plane_. as previously noted , this is the parent plane for all the observed individual fundamental planes .",
    "the injection of different @xmath3 rules for different families of objects at different locations transforms the virial plane into the collection of observed , interlocking fundamental planes that we have called the cosmic metaplane .",
    "the cosmic virial plane is infinite in extent , defined by the ensemble of all possible collapsed objects of all masses and radii . in the real universe , this plane is only partially filled by the actual clustering process .",
    "the challenge of any theory of structure formation is to reproduce the observed distribution of objects versus mass and radius in this plane , i.e. , to populate the plane with the right numbers of objects in the right places . furthermore , to compare with observations , one must calculate _ observed _ radii for galaxies , which involves a theory of angular momentum generation and dissipation for these objects . finally , to reproduce the full distribution in a @xmath0-space defined by the b passband , a theory for @xmath3 is needed , and",
    "thus a theory for converting baryons into b - band starlight .",
    "we do not possess knowledge of all of these ingredients at this time .",
    "nevertheless , schematically it appears that the distribution of objects in @xmath0-space is broadly consistent with the predictions of hcm . to see this",
    ", we focus on @xmath1@xmath5 to take advantage of the radii information there .",
    "we also omit globular clusters , since how or whether they formed from primordial density fluctuations is unclear .    since objects with higher overdensity collapse first in an expanding universe ,",
    "clustering starts with the mass that has highest @xmath155 .",
    "realistic density fluctuation spectra ( e.g. , cold dark matter and its variants ) decline monotonically with mass , so that clustering starts with small , high - density seeds of mass @xmath156 m@xmath154 ( bfpr ) and progresses to form larger masses of lower density . at any epoch",
    ", one expects to find a broad range of densities for collapsed objects at fixed mass , reflecting the fact that the initial overdensity @xmath155 of an individual sphere of mass @xmath4 can vary widely .",
    "the observed distribution of objects in @xmath1@xmath5 is consistent with this picture .",
    "the broad swath of points from upper left to lower right represents the collection of objects that have collapsed to date .",
    "clustering started at the upper left at small masses and is progressing to the lower right .",
    "the total vertical width of the swath in @xmath5 at fixed mass @xmath1 corresponds to a factor of about 20 in radius .",
    "this is roughly consistent with expectations for an initial spectrum of gaussian random fluctuations , as we show below .",
    "the division between galaxies and clusters of galaxies is a vertical line at @xmath157 m@xmath154 ( corresponding to @xmath158 ;   [ kapgal-7 - 4 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath157 m@xmath154 is the mass of a big galaxy and it takes at least three galaxies to make a group , the location of this line is not surprising .",
    "however , in a deeper sense , the division between galaxies and clusters marks the boundary of baryonic dissipation : galaxies ( for the most part ) are objects in which global baryonic dissipation has occurred and to a large extent , groups and clusters are objects in which it has not .",
    "thus , explaining why this line is located exactly where it is and why it appears to be _ vertical _",
    ", i.e. , at fixed mass , requires a full theory of dissipation , which is beyond the scope of this paper . in a general way ,",
    "the location of this line probably reflects the well known boundary for gaseous ionized spheres that can cool before being incorporated into the next level of the merging hierarchy ( rees & ostriker 1977 , bfpr ) .",
    "galaxies and clusters are separated in @xmath1@xmath5 with a clear gap between them .",
    "this is due to baryonic dissipation . to develop a schematic estimate of its effects , we assume that the dissipated baryonic mass per dark halo is @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is of order 0.1 ( bfpr ) , and that the baryonic radius after collapse is given by @xmath161 .",
    "use of the same factor , @xmath160 , in both formulae ensures that the rotational velocity of the collapsed baryons , @xmath34 , will approximately equal @xmath162 .",
    "this is correct for collapse within an isothermal dark halo and also fits our current models of galaxy rotation curves .",
    "we further assume that , for galaxies , the effective mass , @xmath163 , is the same as @xmath164 . with these assumptions ,",
    "@xmath3 decreases by a factor of @xmath160 , while surface brightness @xmath15 increases by @xmath165 .",
    "these estimates enable us to undo the effects of baryonic infall and reconstruct what galactic dark halos would look like if the presently visible light were distributed like the dm .",
    "figure  12a shows an enlargement of @xmath0-space focusing just the @xmath166@xmath5 plane for galaxies , groups and clusters .",
    "the arrow labeled `` dissipative infall '' represents the above infall model .",
    "objects shrink in both mass and radius as a result of baryonic infall , and thus move in both @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "figure  12b attempts to reconstruct the invisible dark halos of galaxies by sliding all galaxy points back along the above infall vector , assuming that @xmath167 . if hierarchical clustering is continuous across the boundary from dissipational to dissipationless collapse , we expect the reconstructed dark halos of galaxies to merge smoothly with those of groups and clusters .",
    "the reconstructed galaxy halos have that property , confirming that the original gap between the two families was the result of dissipation .",
    "note that dissipative infall broadens the total range of masses that can be plotted in figure  12 .",
    "many dark halos of galaxies have lost their separate identities after spawning galaxies by merging with other halos ( the so - called `` overmerging '' phenomenon , katz & white 1993 ) .",
    "visible galaxies also merge but much more slowly since their cross - sections are reduced by baryonic dissipation .",
    "thus , figure  12b , which plots both halo populations together , is broader in mass than the population of halos at any one time  many of the reconstructed galaxy halos no longer exist because they have since merged with other halos to form the dark halos of groups and clusters .",
    "is the general slope of the zoe consistent with hcm ?",
    "figure  12b shows that a major factor in the slope is baryonic dissipation because , without it , the distribution of galactic halos and cluster halos is much flatter than the zoe . to explore the slope more carefully ,",
    "we attempt to calculate the offset of dhgs from e - rich groups and clusters in figure  12a . since both of these groups are on the border of the zoe , understanding their offset from one another will fix its slope .",
    "the calculated offset consists of three parts , which we treat as vectors .",
    "the first vector , @xmath168 , is the dissipation vector just calculated .",
    "the second vector , @xmath169 , is the slope of the density fluctuation spectrum between the mass of a typical dhg dark halo and an e - rich cluster , assuming that both types of object arise from the same @xmath11-@xmath7 fluctuation .",
    "the shift along this vector assumes no change in @xmath3 .",
    "the third vector , @xmath170 , takes account of the fact that there is an extra diminuation in the surface brightness of clusters relative to galaxy halos owing to the fact that much of the baryons in clusters are in hot gas that never formed into galaxies .    to calculate @xmath169 , we need the density fluctuation spectrum over the mass range from dhg halos to e - rich clusters ( @xmath171 m@xmath172 ) .",
    "we take a power - law spectrum of the form    @xmath173    where @xmath174 is the rms amplitude of perturbations of mass @xmath4 at fixed , initial redshift .",
    "we choose the value @xmath10 , which fits the slopes of current candidate density fluctuation spectra over this mass range ( e.g. , cdm ; bfpr ) .",
    "this yields @xmath175 .",
    "after collapse , the equilibrium structural properties of a dark halo that began with given @xmath174 and @xmath4 obey the relations ( gott & rees 1975 ) :    @xmath176    @xmath177    and    @xmath178    combining these with @xmath175 yields the scaling laws for a typical object versus mass :    @xmath179    @xmath180    @xmath181    and    @xmath182    assuming no change in @xmath3 .",
    "these relations allow us to calculate the vector @xmath169 assuming @xmath10 .",
    "the final vector @xmath170 requires us to estimate the extra diminuation in surface brightness of clusters relative to galaxy halos due to hot gas .",
    "we estimate this empirically by taking the total change in @xmath3 between an average dhg galaxy and a typical e - rich cluster ( taken to be 0.95 dex in @xmath2 , or a factor of 44 in @xmath3 , cf .",
    "figure  11 . ) .",
    "we then divide this by the factor due to dissipation ( 10 , above ) , which leaves 4.4 due to hot gas .",
    "this is not far from the factor of 3 estimated from x - rays by muzhotsky ( 1991 ) .",
    "vector @xmath170 affects surface brightness only , leaving mass unchanged .",
    "the three vectors are shown in figure  12a .",
    "their components in @xmath0-space units are : @xmath168 = ( 0.71 , -2.04 ) , @xmath169 = ( 1.79 , -0.11 ) , and @xmath170 = ( 0.00 , -1.05 ) . their sum is a little steeper than the observed zoe , i.e. , the surface brightnesses of e - rich clusters are a little higher than expected .",
    "this could reflect the fact that dissipation is a little smaller than the factor of 10 assumed , or that visible galaxies in e - rich clusters have condensed slightly relative to the dm by dynamical friction .",
    "given the roughness of the calculation , the agreement is acceptable .    in closing this overview of structural properties , for completeness",
    "we plot three other parameter combinations that are often useful .",
    "figures  13 and 14 are updates of plots in bfpr . the first plots baryon density from column 19 versus virial",
    "temperture from column 18 in table  1 , using the equations given in appendix  [ app-1 ] .",
    "this combination is useful for assessing baryon cooling and dissipation , and the density axis ( assuming similar collapse factors ) is a measure of the redshift of collapse .",
    "the distribution of groups and clusters in this diagram is similar to that in bfpr , but the galaxies are different .",
    "the present distribution of galaxies is much more horizontal than the schematic , elongated representation in bfpr , with galaxies strung out at roughly constant density from right to left as a function of hubble type .",
    "the surprising conclusion from this graph is the roughly _ similar density _ of all hubble types within @xmath14 today . at face value , this implies similar collapse redshifts , an inference that could break down , however , if all galaxies did not have constant collapse factor @xmath160 ( see below ) .",
    "our use of stellar half - light radii also underestimates the baryonic radii of late - type galaxies , whose baryons are mostly h  i. a switch to h  i radii would move these galaxies to lower densities and later formation times .",
    "finally , the present database is strongly biased against low - density , low - surface brightness galaxies , which also would appear higher ( later ) in the diagram .",
    "for all these reasons the apparent constancy of formation redshift for all hubble types in figure  13 may be exaggerated .",
    "nevertheless , the present data are adequate to lilluminate the early hubble types , and for them the flatness of the locus in figure  13 is striking .",
    "figure  14 plots velocity versus mass .",
    "this figure resembles the corresponding figure in bfpr more closely because this projection is a nearly edge - on view of the metaplane , and the distribution of points is therefore insensitive to the distribution of objects in the plane .",
    "the long loci of galaxies here are basically the faber - jackson and tf relations .",
    "there is clearly a similar relation for groups and clusters although it has never before received much notice .",
    "figure  15 is new here and plots radius versus mass .",
    "it is useful for estimating the radial collapse factor for galaxies due to baryonic dissipation .",
    "if we fit an @xmath10 power - law slope through the middle of the spiral - rich groups , compare to a similar locus through the middle of the spirals themselves , and demand that the shrinkage due to dissipation be the same in mass as in radius ( i.e. , both equal to @xmath160 ) , we find that an offset of a factor of 19 in radius and mass is required to account for the offset of spirals from spiral - rich groups in figure  15 .",
    "this value of @xmath160 is larger than the usual value of 10 assumed above , but the method is rough .",
    "the point is that figure  15 provides another target to shoot at in matching the radii of galaxies versus groups .",
    "we turn now to substructure within the galaxy and cluster subregions .",
    "the most obvious feature is the  banding \" in @xmath1@xmath5 for galaxies , yielding the downward march of hubble types away from the zoe ( figure  6 ) .",
    "a natural ( but not unique ) interpretation of this phenomenon was given by faber ( 1982a ) and bfpr in terms of forming different hubble types from differing degrees of overdensity .",
    "the overdensity within a given sphere of mass @xmath4 can be written    @xmath183    where @xmath184 is the rms perturbation in spheres of mass @xmath4 .",
    "such a perturbation obeying equation  28 is termed an `` @xmath11-@xmath7 '' perturbation .",
    "equations  2123 imply that families of perturbations with constant values of @xmath11 form parallel lines in @xmath1@xmath5 , with higher @xmath11 lying at higher @xmath5 .",
    "the relation between @xmath11 and the vertical offset @xmath93 is :    @xmath185    cccc [ nsig ] ge & 0.00 & 3 & 1.81 sa & -0.20 & 2.48 & 1.50 sab , b & -0.21 & 2.46 & 1.48 sbc & -0.36 & 2.14 & 1.29 sc & -0.63 & 1.66 & 1 scd & -1.34 & 0.85 & 0.51 sd & -1.97 & 0.47 & 0.28 irr i & -2.46 & 0.30 & 0.18    we can use this relation to infer relative values of overdensity @xmath11 for each of the hubble type bins in figure  6 . these values are tabulated in table  2 .",
    "two normalizations have been used to convert to absolute @xmath11 , one assuming that ges are 3-@xmath7 perturbations as in bfpr , the other that sc s are 1-@xmath7 perturbations .",
    "the latter is more plausible since the predicted number of early - type galaxies is otherwise smaller than observed .",
    "either way , the total range in @xmath11 implied by @xmath93 by equation  29 is about a factor of 10 .",
    "regardless of normalization , the implied overdensity for irr s is only @xmath186 , which is close to 0 .",
    "these objects barely managed to collapse .",
    "notice that equation  29 between @xmath93 and @xmath11 is logarithmic , which means that , as @xmath11 approaches 0 , the ridgelines in figure  12a march to @xmath187 in @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of objects formed from an ensemble of gaussian random perturbations will therefore have a skewed distribution in @xmath1@xmath5 ; the density of objects peaks around the 1-@xmath7 ridgeline and falls off above and below that due to the scarcity of high-@xmath7 peaks on the one hand and the spreading of low-@xmath7 peaks to large radii and low surface brightness on the other .",
    "these features are not yet quantifiable with the present data because they are not volume limited .",
    "however , the observed distribution does broadly show the sharp upper envelope and tail to low @xmath93 that are expected .",
    "the logarithmic relation between @xmath11 and @xmath93 in equation  29 may explain the variable widths of the distributions observed for different hubble types in @xmath93 .",
    "if each hubble type were selected from approximately equal intervals in @xmath11 , it would appear in @xmath1@xmath5 with progressively wider widths for lower values of @xmath11 .",
    "this may help to account for the relatively tight loci of early hubble types versus the wide , amorphous loci of the later types .",
    "the above discussion implicitly assumes all galaxies have the same radial baryonic collapse factor , @xmath160 and overdensity @xmath11 is the sole determiner of hubble type .",
    "this may be termed the `` density hypothesis '' ( faber 1982a ) .",
    "an alternate picture is @xmath160 varies with hubble type .",
    "the simplest way this might happen is if the dark - halo angular momentum parameter @xmath188 ( peebles 1969 ) is not constant with hubble type .",
    "if baryonic collapse is halted by angular momentum ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) , more slowly rotating halos will collapse further . if @xmath189 alone were the determining factor for hubble type , early - type galaxies would descend from slowly rotating , low-@xmath189 dark halos because they are denser at a given mass than late - type galaxies , while late - type galaxies would come from rapidly rotating halos .",
    "the dissipational collapse factor @xmath160 would then determine hubble type .",
    "faber ( 1982a ) termed this the `` dissipation hypothesis '' , but a better term might be the `` @xmath189-hypothesis . ''    since the density hypothesis fits many features of the data , there is no compelling reason at the present time to invoke @xmath189 variations .",
    "n - body simulations of dark halos have furthermore failed to reveal any strong correlation between @xmath189 and environment , as would be needed to explain the high density of early - type galaxies in clusters ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) . however , _ very _ low - surface - brightness objects are under - represented in the present data set .",
    "if they were taken into account , the total spread of galaxies in @xmath93 would be larger , and there would be more reason to invoke @xmath189 , at least as a second parameter .",
    "higher @xmath189 in later - type galaxies would cause them to collapse less , leading to more dm within their baryonic radii ( tinsley 1981 , faber 1982a , verheyen 1997 ) .",
    "excess dm would tend to suppress spiral structure ( toomre 1964 , 1981 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) in later hubble types , producing irr s as observed . on balance",
    ", it would seem timely to re - examine the @xmath189 versus density hypotheses using the newer simulations that model baryonic dissipation more accurately .",
    "it is of course possible that both @xmath189 and initial overdensity are play a role in determining hubble type .",
    "turning now to groups and clusters , we note a parallel banding effect that matches the hubble type bands among galaxies .",
    "the analog to hubble type is mean group hubble type and , as previously noted , there is a strong tendency for early - type - dominated groups to lie close to the zoe and for groups to become progressively late - type - dominated away from this line .",
    "this is simply the",
    " dressler effect \" ( dressler 1980 , postman & geller 1984 ) , wherein the hubble type of a galaxy is strongly correlated with its environment  early types are found preferentially in dense regions , while late types are found in sparse regions .",
    "the origin of this effect is probably that realistic density fluctuation spectra are flatter than white noise , with the result that density fluctuations on neighboring scales are correlated ( bfpr ; bardeen , bond , white , & efstathiou 1988 ) .",
    "the high-@xmath7 peaks that spawn early - type galaxies ( in the density hypothesis ) are statistically embedded in high - peak clusters ( bfpr ) , which also collapse to high density and lie near the zoe .",
    "this effect has been born out by n - body / hydro simulations ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1994 ) .",
    "so far the hcm theory of structure formation is adequate to account for most of the broad features of structures in @xmath0-space .",
    "we now highlight one aspect of the data that has so far eluded explanation .",
    "the question at issue is the _ slope _ of the galaxy loci for individual hubble types in @xmath1@xmath5 .",
    "we have seen in figures  16 that this slope follows the zoe .",
    "we were able to account for the slope of this line _ between galaxies and clusters _ by assuming an @xmath10 power - law coupled with plausible dissipation .",
    "however , the simplest theory would say that dissipation and overdensity ( @xmath11 ) are _ both constant within a given hubble type_. each type should therefore parallel the density fluctuation slope ( vector @xmath169 in figure  12b ) .",
    "this is much shallower than the observed loci for hubble types .",
    "let us review exactly what the vector @xmath169 means .",
    "it is the predicted slope for a collection of objects formed from a power - law initial density fluctuation spectrum with slope @xmath10 , constant @xmath11-@xmath7 overdensity , constant @xmath3 , and constant radial baryonic collapse factor , @xmath160 .",
    "since the observed slope does not match this prediction , one or more of these assumptions must be wrong .",
    "@xmath3 is constrained to vary only modestly by observations , and the constant slope and overdensity of a given hubble type are attractive assumptions we are wanting to test . that leaves @xmath190 constant , which is perhaps the least secure assumption . in words ,",
    "the radii of big galaxies within each hubble type seem to be larger than predicted by the constant collapse picture  big galaxies are more diffuse than expected .",
    "this problem was first highlighted for dhgs by b@xmath112f1 but now appears to affect _ all _ hubble types through at least sc .",
    "what is needed in the constant collapse picture is to either halt the collapse of the baryons at larger radii in the first place or reinflate them to larger radii later .",
    "the extension of the problem to disk - dominated galaxies is thus very significant .",
    "pressure - supported dhgs can be inflated by simply adding energy , for example by heating their stars through mergers in dense groups . however , increasing the radii of _ disk _ galaxies is not as easy  it requires adding angular momentum as well as energy .",
    "this can not be done through mergers without destroying the disks .",
    "thus , the process , whatever it is , must take place for disk galaxies while the material is still gaseous , which adds an important constraint .    to summarize , understanding the existence of the zoe involves two separate phenomena .",
    "one issue is the slope of the line between galaxies and clusters , and that seems explicable using hcm together with plausible dissipation .",
    "the other is the slope of individual hubble types themselves .",
    "this problem has no easy solution at the present time .",
    "is the existence of one , smooth zoe an accident , or is it fundamental ?",
    "whatever the answer , matching galactic radii as a function of mass and hubble type is one of the most pressing targets for galaxy simulations .      a final puzzle concerns the pronounced increase ( and curvature ) in @xmath2 vs. @xmath1 ( @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 ) for groups and clusters ( see figure  9 ) . an offset of groups and clusters to higher @xmath3 than galaxies is expected because the latter contain more dm .",
    "however , this offset does not appear suddenly in going from galaxies to groups , as one might have expected , but rather sets in as a gradual rise in @xmath3 vs. group size .",
    "the cold + hot dark matter ( chdm ) simulations of nolthenius , klypin , & primack ( 1997 ; hereafter nkp97 ) may help to explain part of this effect .",
    "the apparent overlap in @xmath3 between small groups and galaxies may be caused the large errors of small groups due to small - number statistics and projection effects .",
    "appendix  [ app-2 ] compares @xmath3 s for redshift - selected small groups vs. the same groups selected in real space ( figures  16a and 16b ) .",
    "the lower @xmath3 values of the former overlap with the @xmath3 s of galaxies , while the latter do not .",
    "the locus for the simulation redshift - selected groups is also steeper at the faint end and follows the mass - error trajectory .",
    "the same effect is seen in the real groups .",
    "the simlulations thus suggest that errors may be obscuring a real discontinuity in @xmath3 between galaxies and small groups and creating the appearance of a smooth trend . on the other hand , the fact that malin 2 lies on the ge fp , while malin 1 lies within the group @xmath3 for its @xmath4 suggest that these very rare kinds of galaxies can bridge this gap .",
    "this effect can not produce a second and more important trend  the striking overall _ rise _ in group @xmath3 as a function of mass .",
    "remarkably , the same effect is seen in the simulations as well as the real data ( figure  9 vs. figures  16a and 16b ) .",
    "tests show that the effect persists for `` break - up '' vs. `` no - break - up '' group catalogs , and for real - space vs. redshift - space selected groups .",
    "it is not due to a decrease in the average luminosities of galaxies in large groups ( this effect is 20 - 30% at most , appendix  [ app-2 ] ) but rather to an actual decrease in the number of galaxies identified in large clusters .",
    "as we emphasize in that appendix , the simple prescription used for identifying and illuminating galaxies in these pure dissipationless simulations should be adequate only for comparing the properties of groups selected in redshift space to their counterparts selected in real space .",
    "even so , the match to the n93 groups is good enough that it s tempting to wonder whether the simulations may yet capture more truth than one might at first suppose .",
    "in addition , it remains unresolved why the slope of @xmath3 for large groups so closely matches that for dhgs ( the two planes are parallel , cf .",
    "figure  10 ) .",
    "all - in - all , there are several important unanswered questions concerning the @xmath3 s and galaxy formation efficiency in groups and clusters .",
    "it is our hope that the present database ( and its descendents ) will be of use to modelers attempting to simulate galaxy formation and other types of structure in the universe . in assembling the present data , we have taken the easy path of sticking close to raw observations with a minimum of transformations to more fundamental quantities",
    "this has the virtue of minimizing present uncertainties but forces future simulations to be more complete and realistic . here",
    "is a reminder of the basic properties of the present data :    \\1 ) all luminosities are b - band light emitted by stars .",
    "\\2 ) the effect of interstellar extinction in our galaxy is fully corrected for , but the extinction correction for internal extinction corrects galaxies only to face - on . the correction from face - on to fully - corrected is not well understood and depends on both the ratio of absorption to scattering for dust grains and their distribution in the galaxy relative to the stars .",
    "if forward scattering by dust is dominant , face - on luminosities may even be too bright .",
    "\\3 ) radii are half light radii defined by starlight in the observed b - band light profile .",
    "no adjustments are made for variable extinction with radius .",
    "\\4 ) the central line - of - sight velocity dispersion for a hot system , @xmath18 , is adopted as the fundamental definition of velocity .",
    "effective dispersions , @xmath52 , of groups and clusters and peak rotation velocities , @xmath34 , of disk systems are transformed to equivalent values of @xmath18 .",
    "\\5 ) the basic finding list for galaxies consists of objects with the necessary data in the rc3 .",
    "the sample is therefore quasi - magnitude limited and weighted to bright objects .",
    "galaxies of low surface brightness are especially selected against .",
    "four physical processes must be modeled to permit comparison with this data set :    \\1 ) stellar radii of galaxies must be determined .",
    "this requires a theory for the initial distribution of gas within the galaxy , plus a theory for its conversion to stars as a function of radius and time .",
    "the gaseous radii of disks depend on the fraction of baryons that have cooled by today , and from what radius they fell in ( the collapse factor ) .",
    "this in turn depends on angular momentum generation in dark halos including the exchange of angular momentum between the baryons and dm and among the various baryonic components .",
    "angular momentum transfer in mergers and in distant interactions also needs to be considered .",
    "the stellar radii of dhgs depend on the radii of any previously formed stellar disks absorbed in mergers ( kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ) , the relative timescales for infall versus star formation ( faber 1982b ) , mass loss in stellar winds , merger dynamics , and possibly other unknown factors .",
    "\\2 ) b - band luminosities of galaxies must be computed .",
    "this requires the history of star formation at every location , including the stellar birthrate and initial mass function .",
    "luminosity profiles and total luminosities need to be converted to observed face - on quantities by correcting for dust .",
    "\\3 ) for disk galaxies , observed peak rotation velocity @xmath34 must be related to @xmath52 for the dark halo .",
    "this requires a theory for gas infall and the quasi - adiabatic simultaneous pulling - in of the dm particles .",
    "\\4 ) for groups and clusters , the main uncertainty is what fraction of baryons is converted into stars and how this varies as a function of local galaxy density .",
    "there may also be radial or other segregation effects between galaxies , hot gas , and dm .",
    "in this paper we have extended our view of @xmath0-space to include all major types of equilibrium , self - gravitating systems in the local universe . to do this",
    ", we have developed consistent definitions of luminosity , radius , surface brightness , and internal velocity .",
    "internal velocities in particular require special transformations to achieve uniformity among the different types of galaxies .",
    "when these corrections are applied , a pleasing continuum of physical properties is evident among galaxies of all hubble types from giant ellipticals to sd and irr galaxies .",
    "each type of stellar system is found to populate its own fundamental plane in @xmath0-space .",
    "six different planes are found : 1 ) the original fundamental plane for dhgs ; 2 ) a parallel plane slightly offset for sa - sc spirals ; 3 ) a plane with different tilt but similar zero point for scd - irr galaxies ; 4 ) a plane parallel to the dhg plane but offset by a factor of 10 in mass - to - light ratio for rich galaxy clusters ; 5 ) a plane for galaxy groups that smoothly bridges the gap between rich clusters and galaxies ; and 6 ) a plane for galactic globular clusters .",
    "we propose the term `` cosmic metaplane '' to describe this ensemble of interrelated and interconnected fundamental planes .",
    "the projection @xmath1@xmath2 ( @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 ) views all planes nearly edge - on .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath5 projection views all planes close to face - on , while @xmath5@xmath2 shows variable slopes for different groups owing to the different tilts of the individual planes .",
    "no stellar system yet violates the rule first found from the study of dhgs , namely , @xmath191 , which we term the `` zone of exclusion , '' or zoe . in physical terms",
    ", this implies that the maximum global luminosity volume density of stellar systems varies as @xmath9 .",
    "each hubble type defines a band in @xmath1@xmath5 parallel to the zoe .",
    "hubble types march monotonically away from the zoe , with dhgs being closest and sd  irr s most distant .",
    "this reflects a decrease in the average mass and surface brightness along the hubble sequence .",
    "the tully - fisher relation ( @xmath192 ) is simply the proper compromise projection to view the spiral - irregular planes close to edge on , analogous to the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation for dhgs .",
    "all galaxy types , spirals / irregulars and dhgs , show the mutual dependence of characteristic velocity , effective surface brightness and effective radius that first characterized the fundamental plane ( fp ) for ge galaxies .",
    "the fact that the coefficients in these relationships differ somewhat among galaxies of different hubble types again illustrates the fact that we are not dealing with just one fp , but several interlocking ones that form a cosmic metaplane .",
    "the rich clusters orignally studied by schaeffer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) define yet another fundamental plane that is remarkably tight and parallel to that of the dhgs but offset by a factor of 10 higher in mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the galaxy groups of nolthenius ( 1993 ) likewise define a fundamental plane , but one that is tilted and appears to link the fps for rich clusters and for dhgs .",
    "some fraction of this tilt is due to errors in group properties due to small number statistics and chance projection effects , but most appears to be real .",
    "just as the loci of hubble types march steadily away from the zoe along the hubble sequence , the mean location of groups marches away from the zoe with increasing spiral content .",
    "this is the well known dressler ( 1980 ) effect .",
    "the two large diffuse galaxies known as malin 1 and malin 2 have physical properties similar to those of spiral - dominated galaxy groups .",
    "globular clusters distribute themselves within @xmath0-space close to the dhg fundamental plane ( cf .",
    "djorgovski 1995 ; schaeffer et al .",
    "1993 ) but offset in zeropoint .",
    "they occupy a small band of radii , as predicted if the present population of clusters were a small surviving subset of a larger , broader population .    in broad - brush strokes",
    ", the distribution of galaxies , galaxy groups and galaxy clusters within @xmath0-space can be understood as the result of hierarchical clustering and merging from a power - law initial density fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the cosmic metaplane is simply the cosmic virial plane common to all self - gravitating equilibrium stellar systems , tilted and displaced in mass - to - light ratio by different amounts in different regions due to differences in stellar populations and amount of baryonic dissipation .",
    "hierarchical clustering from an @xmath10 power - law density fluctuation spectrum ( plus dissipation ) comes close to reproducing the slope of the zoe .",
    "the progressive displacement of hubble types from this line is consistent with the formation of early - type galaxies from higher @xmath11-@xmath7 fluctuations than later hubble types .",
    "a major mystery is why the slopes of _ individual _ hubble types in the @xmath1@xmath5 plane parallel the zoe . at face value",
    ", this appears to suggest _ less _ dissipation of massive galaxies within their dark halos compared to lower - mass galaxies of the same hubble type .",
    "a second mystery is the behavior of @xmath3 vs. @xmath49 for groups and clusters .",
    "two slopes are seen , both tight , with group @xmath3 s climbing more steeply than clusters . the same general rise in @xmath3 vs. @xmath4",
    "is seen in the simulations , but we have no good physical explanation either there or in the real data .",
    "the tightness in @xmath3 implies a remarkably close coupling between the galaxy formation efficiency , stellar populations , hot gas content , and dark matter content of groups and clusters as a function of total mass .",
    "we discuss the limitations of the present data and alert modelers to the large number of physical processes that need to be calculated in order to make a realistic comparison between these data and simulations .",
    "use of the b band is an important limitation .",
    "one would ideally like to view the properties of these stellar systems in redder passbands less affected by dust and recent star formation .",
    "also crucial is a volume - limited sample of nearby galaxies , needed for an unbiased census of galaxies in @xmath0-space .",
    "we now realize that the initial discovery of the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane a decade ago was but the first glimpse of the full cosmic metaplane that is defined by the physical properties of all gravitationally - bound , star - defined systems . as with our first investigation of",
    "dynamically hot galaxies , @xmath0space has proved to be a valuable tool for exploring this `` cosmic metaplane . ''    the data used here are the result of the collected efforts of many astronomers over the years , as summarized in the catalog tables we have used .",
    "we thank alberto cappi for sending us the schaefer et al .",

    "in this appendix we give convenient relations for transforming @xmath0 parameters into more familiar quantities .",
    "the fundamental plane parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath18 are related to the @xmath0 parameters as follows :    @xmath193    @xmath194    @xmath195    with @xmath14 in kpc and @xmath18 in km s@xmath22 , we define @xmath196 m@xmath92 , where we have taken the standard keplerian formula for defining the mass of a disk , @xmath197 , and corrected @xmath34 to @xmath18 as given by @xmath68 .",
    "this yields    @xmath198    with @xmath14 in kpc and @xmath15 in b - band l@xmath92 pc@xmath23 , the luminosity within the effective radius is defined as @xmath199 l@xmath92 , resulting in    @xmath200    the b - band mass - to - light ratio within @xmath14 is the ratio of these two :    @xmath201 \\ , ( \\odot )      = \\log \\ , ( \\sigma_c^2 r_e ) - \\log \\ , ( i_e { r_e}^2 ) - 0.83 \\ ,      = \\sqrt{3 } \\kappa_3 - 0.83 \\ , .\\ ] ]    our definitions of effective virial temperature , @xmath202 , and mean baryon number density within the effective radius , @xmath99 , follow those of bfpr .",
    "for @xmath202 we equate a maxwellian distribution to a boltzmann distribution , @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the proton mass . using a mean molecular weight @xmath205 for ionized primordial h@xmath53he yields @xmath206 k @xmath207 k , for @xmath7 in km s@xmath22 .",
    "thus    @xmath208    the baryon number density @xmath99 is defined as @xmath209 , where @xmath160 is the fraction of @xmath163 contributed by baryons within the effective radius .",
    "the baryon correction is expressed as @xmath210 . in the present units ,",
    "@xmath211    systems that are dominated by dark matter ( dm ) have significant baryon corrections .",
    "examples are galaxy groups ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 ) , galaxy clusters ( mushotzsky 1991 ) , and extreme dwarf spheroidals ( b@xmath112f1 ) , for which we assume @xmath212 . for dwarf ellipticals ,",

    "all of these @xmath214 corrections are likely to be within 0.3 dex of being correct , which is similar to the error that we make by assuming that all the mass is spherically distributed .",
    "systematic errors of this size are of no consequence to our conclusions .",
    "there are several well - known difficulties in linking galaxies in redshift space into true , physical associations with properly measured properties :    \\(1 ) as filamentary structures are usually comprised of a series of dense regions of galaxies , groups are often poorly separated from surrounding galaxies .",
    "this can lead to contamination from foreground and background galaxies .",
    "\\(2 ) group structure is often unrelaxed , so that local gravitational tidal fields from larger masses ( say superclusters ) can have a significant effect on the spatial and redshift distribution of galaxies within even a bound group .",
    "these problems require that a grouping algorithm be carefully calibrated against realistic simulations which include these effects . while based on the early nolthenius & white ( 1987 ) simulations , the n93 link criteria have recently been shown to be near optimal ( as defined below ) by calibration with more recent n - body simulations ( nolthenius , klypin & primack 1994 ; nkp94 ; nolthenius , klypin & primack 1997 ; nkp97 ) , which use the simulations of klypin , nolthenius & primack ( 1997 ) . our plan is to use versions of these catalogs constructed to match the cfa1 survey and compare @xmath0space properties in redshift space to those of groups selected in real space ( i.e. using full 3d information ) .",
    "the klypin et al .",
    "n - body simulation we use here evolves an @xmath215 , @xmath216 mix of `` cold + hot dark matter '' ( a chdm model ) on a 100 mpc across @xmath217 cell grid using a particle - mesh pure dissipationaless code . within this simulation ,",
    "potential galaxies are identified as cells with local overdensity @xmath218 . since galaxies must be local overdensities , a centrally concentrated array of overdense cells",
    "will still be identified as only a single galaxy .",
    "we identify all @xmath219 `` galaxies '' , generate an equal number of schechter luminosities , and pair up the luminosities with galaxies so that luminosity rises monotonically with 1-cell mass .",
    "we then select a `` home galaxy '' similar to our location in the real universe , observe the catalog and impose the cfa1 s @xmath220 . magnitude limit .",
    "since `` observing '' is done after @xmath49 s are assigned , large scale flows and malmquist bias will lead to a steeper @xmath221 and brighter @xmath222 when observed in redshift space .",
    "the @xmath49 assignment is therefore done iteratively until the redshift - space - observed luminosity function and the sky - projected galaxy density of the resulting catalogs both match that of the cfa1 . to include possible edge effects",
    "yet maximize sample size , we include the full sky minus a @xmath223 wide `` zone of avoidance '' , which includes roughly 9000 `` galaxies '' and 830 `` groups '' .",
    "see nkp97 for a more complete description of the construction of the sky catalogs .",
    "we analyze here nkp97 s chdm@xmath61 simulation because both the fraction of galaxies in groups and the median group velocity dispersions closely match those of identically selected cfa1 groups not only at the optimal link parameters but throughout the entire range of links ( nkp94 , nkp97 ) .",
    "nkp97 argue that these two properties are very sensitive to the spatial and velocity structure of galaxies on group scales , and therefore are the most appropriate indicators to match when attempting to design and calibrate an optimal grouping algorithm .",
    "however , we strongly caution against identifying these objects with representative observed galaxies _ in a chdm universe _",
    ", for two reasons . first , with a cell size of 195 kpc , these simulations have neither the resolution nor the baryonic physics needed to model individual galaxies or even galaxy dark matter halos with confidence .",
    "second , the dark matter halos in these simulations are affected by the overmerging problem ( katz & white 1993 ) and the proper way to `` break up '' these overmergers into galaxies is still poorly understood .",
    "in fact , it is the un - broken catalogs which show the closest structural similarities to the real data and which we therefore use here .",
    "we also note that while the nkp97 `` breakup '' catalogs yield closely similar @xmath0space properties , it is quite possible the level of overmerging was underestimated ( see nkp97 `` 2@xmath224 '' results ) .",
    "our goal here is only to see how @xmath0 values change between real space and redshift space .",
    "we resist the temptation to judge the merits of chdm as a cosmological model .",
    "the redshift space link relations are described in n93 and nkp97 . to select corresponding groups in real space",
    "we again seek to identify number density enhancements above a consistent density contrast , with 3d information , the n93 sky and redshift dimensions are now described by a single isotropic separation , which is again scaled to account for growing incompleteness at higher distance .",
    "distances here assume a smooth hubble law , and , unlike in n93 , there has been no attempt to `` fine - tune '' groups in the densest regions .",

    "the @xmath241 parameters are calculated using one - dimensional velocity dispersions obtained by scaling the true 3d velocity dispersions assuming isotropy ( i.e. no strongly radial / tangential orbits for galaxies in mock groups ) .",
    "we define the @xmath0 parameters as before , except that we use full 3d information to define the half light , virial radius , and velocity dispersion .",
    "the distribution of the resulting groups in @xmath0space is shown in figure  16b .",
    "the optimal linking in redshift space is defined as that which produces median group velocity dispersions and group memberships which best match those formed from grouping in real space in the mock - sky catalog .",
    "this optimal redshift linkage , @xmath46 km / sec for @xmath242 , was determined in nkp94 and fortuitously agrees with that used earlier on the cfa1 data to generate the n93 groups catalog used here .",
    "the virial - to - true mass ratios of simulated groups selected for the mock - sky catalog with the n93 link criteria have large scatter , but show a median quite close to 1 ( nkp97 ) .",
    "however , @xmath243 of the simulated 3-member groups have such large virial - to - true mass ratios that they are likely chance groupings .",
    "this suggests that most cfa1 groups are likely bound , but with some contamination from unbound groups at the 3-member level .",
    "there is also confirming evidence from x - ray studies of galaxy groups that at least the e - dominated groups are bound systems , even with as few as 2 giant galaxies ( cf .",
    "mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 ) .    as in all of our plots ,",
    "selection effects will skew the relative density of groups across @xmath0space .",
    "in particular , we preferentially select richer groups both because they can be seen at greater distance and because massive potentials with few galaxies will tend to be missed since their large velocity dispersions will mimic low density in redshift space .",
    "figure  16a shows the @xmath0space distribution for these chdm@xmath61 groups identified in redshift space using the n93 linking .",
    "the distribution of the 3d selected simulation groups in @xmath0space is shown in figure  16b . comparing figure  16a with figure  16b",
    ", we find that properties change little in going from real to to redshift space , so that the fundamental features of the kappa space distributions of observed groups , which of necessity must be identified in redshift space , should be reliable .",
    "we find shifts , in the sense redshift - space to real - space , of only 0.3 in @xmath1 , -0.2 in @xmath5 , and 0.3 in @xmath2 .",
    "there is one important difference between redshift - selected groups and with real - space selected groups , however . as the simulated volume is small",
    "there is a paucity of rich dense clusters in the simulation . in comparing these figures ,",
    "we ve chosen not to focus on individual @xmath0 shifts for each group , since not all groups have both redshift  space and real - space counterparts .",
    "some groups break into two , or merge , or members drop out , or new members appear .",
    "we next note that , as in the cfa1 data , there is somewhat of a tendency for the richer groups to show a flatter fundamental plane than poor groups .",
    "at least some of this tendency is due to correlated noise .",
    "note that the ( noisy ) virial mass appears in the numerator of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . from equations 1 and 3 ,",
    "we see that perfectly random masses would yield a `` fundamental plane '' with slope @xmath244 .",
    "since this is steeper than observed , it s not suprising that more poorly sampled and hence noisier groups would show a steeper fp .",
    "however , the fact that the slope is little changed for 3d groups shows that most of slope of their fp is real .",
    "we also find a tendency for the grouping algorithm to miss some valid members on the tail of the redshift distribution for distant massive groups , while including spurious infalling outliers along the line of sight .",
    "this latter effect has the tendency to artifically concentrate the group , and thus lower the virial radius and mass .",
    "high velocity dispersion systems are more common at high distance .",
    "if too many members on the tail of the redshift distribution miss the magnitude cut , they can break the redshift link and miss inclusion .",
    "indeed , the algorithm was tuned to best select average groups and appears to systematically underestimate the dispersion of massive clusters .",
    "this may lead to the cutoff in @xmath3 for rich clusters that is somewhat sharper than for the poorer , lower velocity dispersion groups .",
    "of the 5 abell clusters in n93 which have struble & rood ( 1991 ) velocity dispersions , the n93 dispersions average 30% smaller ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "some part of this effect may also arise from subclustering within clusters .",
    "finally , we note the striking similarity between the observed ( figure  9 ) and simulated distributions of groups in @xmath0-space . to some extent",
    ", this may reflect the careful choice of simulation and mock - sky constructions .",
    "on the other hand , is it possible that the distributions are primarily determined by the gravitation of the dark matter and our simple luminosity assignment method is not far off .",
    "if so , the simulations may capture most of the essense of the problem and , if correcting for overmerging leaves @xmath0space relatively unchanged , the agreement between chdm and observations may then be significant .",
    "in any case , we found that the population differences between rich and poor simulation groups was only a minor factor ; richer clusters have galaxies with luminosities only @xmath246 below those of poorer clusters .",
    "the main cause for the @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 trend is that there are simply fewer galaxies per unit mass in richer groups .",
    "this is seen by calculating @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is the number of visible group members at an arbitrary , but constant distance , and @xmath4 is the group virial mass .",
    "we find @xmath249 , 0.50 and 0.68 for the redshift space , real space , and breakup versions , respectively .",
    "while a more appropriate break - up prescription may well produce more galaxies ( nkp97 ) , this hypothetical break - up scheme would have to be quite extreme to make @xmath250 .",

    "<S> hierarchical clustering from an @xmath10 power - law density fluctuation spectrum ( plus dissipation ) comes close to reproducing the slope of the zoe , and the progressive displacement of hubble types from this line is consistent with the formation of early - type galaxies from higher @xmath11-@xmath7 fluctuations than late hubble types .    </S>",

    "<S> , this appears to suggest _ less _ dissipation of massive galaxies within their dark halos compared to lower - mass galaxies of the same hubble type . </S>",
    "<S> the third is why we find isotropic stellar systems only within an effective mass range of @xmath12 . </S>",
