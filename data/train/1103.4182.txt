    "various structures in the universe starting from compact objects , such as stars and planets , and including constellations , galaxies and clusters of galaxies , rotate . this made physicists suppose that the universe itself can be rotating .",
    "the first model for such rotating universe was suggested by k.  gdel yet in 1949 , who found an exact solution for the @xmath2 dimensional rotating universe @xcite in general relativity .",
    "the solution is homogeneous , has rotational symmetry , and allows for the definition of the direction of positive time consistently in the whole space - time , and , what has been in the focus of recent research .",
    "it also allows for closed time - like curves .    in the einstein gravity a static black hole",
    "can not be embedded in the vacuum gdel universe .",
    "however such an embedding is possible if extra fields are added .",
    "the asymptotically gdel , 5-dimensional , nonrotating black hole solution was obtained by gimon and hashimoto @xcite for the low - energy supergravity limit , i.  e. in the presence of an extra gauge field .",
    "this solution attracted considerable interest due to its utility when studying exact solutions in the form of the so - called pp - waves in string theory @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in perturbations of asymptotically gdel space - times from a different point of view .",
    "first , the gdel universe has a peculiar feature : at its asymptotic , far region it allows for the closed time - like curves ( ctcs ) which opens possibility of existence of the time machine .",
    "thus , existence of compact objects ( for instance , black holes ) in such space - times would look most unreal and one could expect that there should be some physical laws which forbid such geometries .",
    "indeed , there are a number of topological theorems which shows that nature should favor `` normal '' causality of the world . yet , these are rather geometrical arguments , than a rigorous physical reason .    an interesting observation , which might be an example of such a physical reason of the nonexistence objects allowing for ctcs , was made in @xcite , where it was numerically shown that the infinite cylinder ( with an event horizon ) in general relativity has infinitely growing modes in its characteristic spectrum .",
    "thus , the cylindrical space - time , allowing for ctcs , is also gravitationally unstable . from this observation",
    ", one could expect that there is a deeper correlation between the onset of the instability and existence of ctcs .",
    "a straightforward way is to check other compact objects with ctcs as to their stability .",
    "this can be done by investigation of the proper oscillation frequencies ( called quasinormal modes @xcite for black holes ) of the compact object under consideration .",
    "these frequencies dominate at intermediate late time in the black hole s response to the external perturbation .",
    "quasinormal modes of the gimon - hashimoto black holes were first studied in @xcite , though the wave equation in @xcite was obtained for the slow rotation limit . in this limit , the obtained effective potential looks like the one for the 5-dimensional schwarzschild black hole with a shift in frequency , which depends on the universe rotation parameter @xmath0 . in this approximation properties of the asymptotics of the wave equation and , consequently , boundary conditions , are qualitatively the same as for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "therefore , quasinormal spectrum is just shifted schwarzschild spectrum @xcite . following the approximation used in @xcite",
    ", there appeared a number of consequent works on quasinormal modes and hawking radiation of more general solutions and other fields @xcite .",
    "thus , we have a few motivations to study qn spectrum of the asymptotically gdel black holes : first is the revealing of possible correlation between the gravitational instability and existence of ctcs , second , quest for a qualitative insight of main features of the quasinormal spectrum in the rotating universe , and third , possible utility of qnms of the exact sting theory background given by the gimon - hashimoto solution .",
    "having in mind the above motivations , in the present work we managed to separate angular variables without any approximation through using different coordinate system .",
    "the exact wave equation which we obtained revealed qualitatively new feature , which is connected with different asymptotics of the wave equation in the region far from a black hole .",
    "we have found that no schwarzschild - like boundary conditions , that is , purely outgoing waves , are allowed at infinity . instead dirichlet",
    "boundary conditions should be imposed , in a similar fashion with the asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes , whose qnms were extensively studied in the context of gauge / gravity duality ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews of qnms ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we mention some basic properties of the gimon - hashimoto solution .",
    "sec iii describes separation of variables in the wave equation for a scalar field .",
    "iv is devoted to boundary conditions for the quasinormal modes , while in sec .",
    "v we briefly relate the numerical methods which were used for calculations of the quasinormal modes .",
    "vi discuss particular case of empty gdel space - time ( without a black hole ) .",
    "sec vii and viii are devoted to spectrum of gdel black holes , which includes the case of the quasiextremal universe rotation for which some analytical results were obtained .",
    "finally , we discuss the obtained results and their meaning for stability of the black holes and its possible correlation with the existence of closed time - like curves .",
    "the bosonic fields of the minimal ( 4 + 1)- supergravity theory consist of the metric and the one - form gauge field , which are governed by the following equations of motion @xmath3 here , @xmath4 .    in the euler coordinates @xmath5 , the solution of the equations of motion ( [ einsteineq]-[maxwelleq ] ) , describing the gdel universe , has the form @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 defines the scale of the gdel background . at @xmath8",
    "we have the minkowski space - time .",
    "the solution for the schwarzschild black hole in the gdel universe is given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 the radius of the event horizon is also corrected by parameter @xmath0 , @xmath11    an essential feature of the above gimon - hashimoto solutions is possibility of the closed time - like curves ( ctcs ) in a region far from the black hole , @xmath12",
    "in order to derive the wave equation we only need the relation @xmath13 which implies @xmath14    the nonvanishing components of the inverse metric have the following form @xmath15    the scalar field perturbations in a curved background are governed by the klein - gordon equation @xmath16 since the background metric has the killing vectors @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , we choose the ansatz for the wave function as @xmath20    substituting ( [ ansatz ] ) into ( [ klein - gordon ] ) and separating the variables , one can find that the angular part of the function satisfies the equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the separation constant with the eigenvalues @xmath23    the equation for the radial part takes the wave - like form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the tortoise coordinate , which is defined as @xmath26 the effective potential can be written in terms of the coordinate @xmath27 as follows @xmath28    now we are in position to perform numerical analysis of the quasinormal spectrum for the obtained wave equation .",
    "at the classical level , a wave can not be emitted from the black hole horizon , so that the standard boundary condition for a great variety of black holes is requirement of the purely ingoing wave at the event horizon , @xmath29 where @xmath30    taking account of @xmath31 , we find that @xmath32    at spatial infinity we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35    since the exponents @xmath36 have purely real index , they do not describe ingoing or outgoing waves . therefore , we are unable to impose usual quasinormal boundary conditions",
    ". however , we can use the analogy with ads backgrounds and require dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial infinity .",
    "this implies that @xmath37 for @xmath38 or @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "the nontrivial behavior of the functions @xmath41 is observed when @xmath42 . in this case",
    "both exponents have oscillatory behavior at spatial infinity .",
    "thus , in order to impose the dirichlet boundary conditions we must consider the factor @xmath43 . when @xmath42 one can find that @xmath44 implying that one of @xmath41 is convergent and the other one is divergent as @xmath45 .",
    "the only exception is @xmath46 , when both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are convergent .",
    "for this case we recall that we require the function norm be convergent at spatial infinity , i.  e. , if @xmath49 , then the norm @xmath50 is divergent .",
    "the asymptotically anti - de sitter space - times allow for a family of boundary conditions and a family of norms . for lower dimensional ads black holes , such as the 2 + 1 dimensional btz black holes @xcite ,",
    "the vanishing flux at infinity is used sometimes as the boundary condition @xcite .",
    "if instead of the above norm one uses the flux of the field , such norm will be even stronger divergent for the @xmath46 case .",
    "thus , the boundary conditions do not allow us to have purely imaginary quasinormal mode for @xmath46 .",
    "however , we observe that @xmath51 approaches zero at some value of the rotation parameter ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fundamental ] ) .",
    "since we can not find any quasinormal mode for larger values of the rotation parameter , probably , one should interpret this as disappearing of the particular mode after this threshold value of @xmath0 is reached .",
    "we observe this `` disappearing '' of the quasinormal modes only for the case of @xmath46 .",
    "the quasinormal modes with the positive real frequency exist for all values of @xmath0 , if @xmath52 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : m=123 ] ) . for negative @xmath53",
    "we observe the same tendency to `` disappear '' , though for the fundamental mode the extremal value of @xmath0 is reached before the real part vanishes ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : l=1 ] , [ fig : m=-123 ] ) . since for higher overtones , modes disappear at lower threshold values of @xmath0 , we may expect that for some near - extremal value of the rotation parameter we have only finite number of the modes with positive real part . because of the symmetry of the spectrum , @xmath54 we still have infinite number of modes with negative value of the real part .",
    "here , we shall briefly relate two standard methods used for numerical search of quasinormal modes : the shooting method and frobenius method .",
    "these two alternative methods were used in order to guarantee the validity of the obtained results .",
    "more detailed discussion of both methods can be found in @xcite .    * shooting method*. since at the horizon we require the purely ingoing wave ( [ hor - asymptot ] ) , it is convenient to define a new function in such a way , @xmath55 that it becomes regular at the event horizon .",
    "we fix the wave - function norm so that @xmath56 . substituting ( [ reg - function ] ) into ( [ wave - like ] ) and expanding the wave equation near the horizon , we find that @xmath57 . this gives us boundary condition at the horizon for any fixed @xmath58 , which we use for the numerical integration of the equation ( [ wave - like ] ) . at large distances",
    "we compare the result of our numerical integration with the large - distance asymptotic series expansion ( [ inf - asymptot ] ) and find the coefficients @xmath59 by using the fitting procedure .",
    "then , quasinormal modes can be found by minimizing @xmath60 or @xmath61 depending on the sign of @xmath51 . in order to check convergence of the procedure",
    "we check that obtained frequencies do not change within specified accuracy , if we increase precision of floating - point operations or the distance at which we use the fit",
    ".    * frobenius method . * this method allows us to find qnms by solving numerically an equation with continued fractions , which takes much less computer time for finding quasinormal modes .",
    "one can rewrite the wave - function as @xmath62 where @xmath63 must be regular at spatial infinity and the event horizon , once @xmath58 is the quasinormal frequency .",
    "we choose `` - '' sign for @xmath64 , and `` + '' sign for @xmath65 .",
    "the function @xmath63 can be expanded into a series near the horizon @xmath66 after we substitute ( [ frobenius - prefactor ] ) and ( [ frobenius ] ) into equation ( [ wave - like ] ) , we find the three - term recurrence relation for the coefficients @xmath67 @xmath68    from the above , the coefficients of the three - term recurrence relation can be found in a closed form . finally , we find the equation with the infinite continued fraction on the righthand side @xmath69 which we solve numerically with respect to the quasinormal frequencies @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "let us take the limit @xmath72 in the wave equation ( [ wave - like ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath73 , the tortoise coordinate @xmath74 and the wave equation ( [ wave - like ] ) is reduced to a much simpler form @xmath75    substituting @xmath76 and @xmath77 we obtain the kummer s equation @xmath78 with respect to the new coordinate @xmath79 here @xmath80 and @xmath81 the solution of the kummer s equation , which produces regular at the origin ( @xmath82 ) wave - function @xmath83 , is @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the generalized hypergeometric series , which has an irregular singularity at @xmath86 , unless @xmath87 is a nonpositive integer .",
    "thus , one has @xmath88 finally , from ( [ cond ] ) we find @xmath89    one can see an interesting features of the scalar waves in @xmath71 gdel universe : there is a minimal value of frequency for any multipole number @xmath90 , which is @xmath91 for @xmath92 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : smallm ] ) . waves with lower frequencies can not propagate in the gdel universe .",
    "a similar property was observed by hiscock for the four - dimensional gdel universe in @xcite .    there are both positive and negative frequencies in the spectrum .",
    "negative ones were interpreted by hiscock @xcite as those propagating back in time , because of the allowed closed time - like curves .",
    "indeed , let us associate a wave with a negative frequency as that propagating back in time .",
    "then , due to the symmetry ( [ specsym ] ) , we can conclude that such a wave with a given frequency corresponds to the opposite value of the azimuthal number @xmath53 , which is eigenvalue of the time - like killing vector in the region with ctcs .",
    "this means that the wave , propagating back in time in the region near the black hole , also propagates back in time when it reaches the region with ctcs .",
    "we can see that the perturbation spectrum of the five - dimensional gdel space - time is qualitatively similar to the four - dimensional spectrum @xcite , and resembles the spectrum of empty anti - de sitter space - time @xcite , as both consist of equally spaced normal modes .",
    "in general , quasinormal modes @xmath58 are complex and @xmath51 is the real oscillation frequency , while @xmath93 is proportional to the damping rate of a given mode . for normal modes of pure gdel space - times discussed above @xmath94 , so that waves look like nondamping ( standing ) waves in a confining box .",
    "another essential property of quasinormal modes is their significance for stability analysis : if all qn modes are damped , the black hole is believed to be stable , while existence of any growing mode indicates gravitational instability .",
    "analytically stability is guaranteed if the effective potential is positive definite outside the black hole , which happens only in a few simplest cases , i.  e. for the schwarzschild back hole .",
    "more general cases , and the gdel black hole is one of them , require further numerical approach to the wave equation for the analysis of of stability .",
    "quasinormal modes have been effectively used in a number of works for checking of the gravitational stability ( or finding of instability ) of various black holes @xcite .",
    "the pure gdel space - time has one scale parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter defines a scale of the universe which is distance @xmath95 to the region where the closed time - like geodesic trajectories exist .",
    "when we add a black hole to the gdel universe , another scale parameter appears , which is the black hole radius @xmath96 . in this paper",
    "we consider fixed black hole masses and various universe s rotation parameters @xmath0 .",
    "however , instead one could fix the scale of the universe @xmath0 and look at various @xmath96 . in the latter case",
    ", black holes are parameterized by the dimensionless quantity @xmath97 . for small values of @xmath0",
    ", @xmath97 quickly approaches zero and the metric ( [ metric ] ) tends to the pure gdel space - time with the quasinormal spectrum given by the normal modes of gdel space - time ( [ godelqnms ] ) , what is confirmed by modes shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : smallj ] .    in concordance with this , on fig .",
    "[ fig : smallm ] it is shown that as @xmath72 , that is @xmath98 at a fixed @xmath0 , qnms approach normal modes of the gdel space - time .",
    "this behavior exactly resembles the one of the asymptotically ads black holes , for which qnms approach normal modes of ads space - time in the limit @xmath99 @xcite . as @xmath0 approaches zero at a fixed @xmath100",
    ", we have the limit of normal modes of the gdel space - time @xmath101    thus , at small @xmath0 qnms of black holes in the gdel universe are shorter lived and have larger real oscillation frequency , when @xmath0 increases .",
    "the numerical search of modes includes a kind of indeterminacy because a mode is a root of quite complicated and lengthy algebraic equation , so that ad hoc we do not know which mode corresponds to which overtone number @xmath1 . at the same time , we are most interested in fundamental modes @xmath102 , which are longest lived and are , therefore , dominate at late time . in order to track value of @xmath1 of each mode , we started from very small values of @xmath0 for which the quasinormal modes are close to the normal modes , and increased gradually the rotation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the universe naturally contains only very _ small relatively the universe scale _ black holes .",
    "therefore , quasinormal modes of asymptotically gdel black holes are inevitably very close to the normal modes of the gdel universe . in other words , the quasinormal spectrum which we obtained represents rather the ringing of the universe itself slightly corrected by the presence of a black hole .",
    "a somewhat more phenomenological approach to the black hole in the rotating universe was suggested in @xcite , in the limit of small universe s rotation . in @xcite",
    "the asymptotic of the wave equation is qualitatively the same as in the 5-dimensional schwarzschild case and the spectrum is schwarzschild - like , though with some corrections proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "another interesting phenomena can be noticed on fig .",
    "[ fig : fundamental ] : @xmath51 vanishes after reaching some critical , moderate value of @xmath0 , so that the mode can not be numerically detected at larger @xmath0 . as we could not fully investigate the limit of quasiextremal rotation @xmath0 numerically , below we shall try to analyze the wave equation analytically in this limit .",
    "qnms which are shown on fig . 1 - 6 ,",
    "although obtained for small and moderate @xmath0 , do not demonstrate any tendency to instability , because the damping rate , which is proportional to @xmath103 , increases as @xmath0 grows .",
    "we have not reached , however , the extremal values of @xmath0 for all modes and , therefore , can not state that there is no instability for all @xmath0 .",
    "in the near - extremal black hole limit one has @xmath104 , while the event horizon approaches zero . implying that this situation is rather exotic , let us consider a universe rotating with speed very close to its extremal one , so that the radius of a black hole will still be finite and very close to zero . in this case , @xmath105 and the tortoise coordinate @xmath25 again coincides with @xmath27 .",
    "then , the wave equation takes the following form @xmath106    when @xmath107 equation ( [ extremaleq ] ) has two irregular singular points : @xmath82 and @xmath108 , but when @xmath46 , @xmath82 becomes a regular singular point and the general exact solution can be found . for the massless field ( @xmath109 )",
    "it is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "one of these bessel functions converges at infinity , satisfying the dirichlet boundary condition , while the other one diverges .",
    "however , this function is divergent also at @xmath82 .",
    "it is natural to expect that the function is divergent at the horizon .",
    "the radius of the horizon approaches zero when considering quasiextremal black holes . in order to have physically meaningful solution one has to require purely ingoing wave at the horizon , which is not possible for the extremal limit .",
    "thus , formally the problem of the adequate boundary conditions in the extremal case remains open . if we require the wave - function to have a finite norm , there are no quasinormal modes allowing it , what is consistent with the numerical results in the near - extremal region .    since ( [ extremaleq ] ) coincides with ( [ nobheq ] ) for @xmath46 and @xmath112 we repeat the procedure of sec .",
    "[ sec : nobh ] and find that @xmath113 what can not be satisfied for @xmath114 because @xmath115 .    for the particular case @xmath116 , @xmath92 , we can easily find the solution which satisfies the dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial infinity @xmath117 however , similarly to ( [ divergent ] ) , one can prove that this solution leads to a divergent norm as @xmath118 .    thus , we conclude that _ for @xmath119 there is no solution _ , which satisfies the quasinormal boundary conditions .",
    "numerical calculations show that this takes place in some near - extremal region as well .",
    "physically we may interpret this as nonexistence of the most symmetrical perturbations of the quasiextremely rotating gdel universe , which can still be considered small . in case of arbitrary values of @xmath53 and @xmath90",
    "the question of stability of perturbations remains open .",
    "ads radius @xmath120 & universe s scale @xmath121 + small bh @xmath122 & small bh @xmath123 + @xmath124 normal modes of ads & @xmath124 normal modes of gdel +   +    in the present work we have studied the scalar field perturbations around the giomon - hashimoto solution , which is the generalization of 5-dimensional schwarzschild solution immersed in the gdel universe .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the quasinormal spectrum of such `` schwarzschild - gdel '' black hole is totally different from the schwarzschild spectrum and resembles the spectrum of asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes ( see table [ thetable ] ) .",
    "the latter is due to the dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial infinity imposed for the asymptotically gdel space - times .",
    "the numerical analysis shows no signs of instability at small and moderate values of the universe s scale @xmath0 , which means that the conjectured correlation of the gravitational instability and existence of closed time - like curves , if it exists , is not straightforward .    the frequencies @xmath58 are eigenvalues of the killing vector @xmath125 which is timelike in some region near black hole . in the region",
    "far form the black hole we have ctcs and the timelike killing vector is @xmath126 with the integer eigenvalue @xmath53 .",
    "we can not have a consistent solution which is not periodic in the region with ctcs .",
    "thus we can think about existence or nonexistence of growing oscillations only in the region near the black hole .",
    "the region with ctcs always implies periodical dynamics in it .",
    "this periodical behavior of the scalar field in the asymptotical region effectively provides a `` confining box '' from the point of view of the observer near a black hole in the gdel universe .",
    "that is why we require the dirichlet boundary condition at infinity . from the mathematical viewpoint",
    "this boundary condition is dictated by the structure of the irregular singularity at @xmath108 .    in the future",
    "we would like to consider perturbations of rotating analog of gimon - hashimoto solution , which should show much reacher physics .",
    "in particular , we expect that the effective confining box given by the dirichlet boundary condition together with rotation , and thus with superradiance , should produce the superradiant instability in the regime of quick rotation @xcite .",

    "<S> a black hole immersed in a rotating universe , described by the gimon - hashimoto solution , is tested on stability against scalar field perturbations . unlike the previous studies on perturbations of this solution , which dealt only with the limit of slow universe rotation @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we managed to separate variables in the perturbation equation for the general case of arbitrary rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to qualitatively different dynamics of perturbations , because the exact effective potential does not allow for schwarzschild - like asymptotic of the wave function in the form of purely outgoing waves . </S>",
    "<S> the dirichlet boundary conditions are allowed instead , which result in a totally different spectrum of asymptotically gdel black holes : the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies is similar to the one of asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes . at large and intermediate overtones @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is equidistant in @xmath1 . in the limit of small black holes , quasinormal modes ( qnms ) </S>",
    "<S> approach the normal modes of the empty gdel space - time . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence of instability in the found frequencies , which supports the idea that the existence of closed time - like curves ( ctcs ) and the onset of instability correlate ( if at all ) not in a straightforward way . </S>"
