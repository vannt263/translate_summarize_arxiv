    "the @xmath0 vector meson is the lightest bound state of a strange ( s ) quark and a anti strange ( @xmath10 ) quark .",
    "it has a mass of 1.01945 @xmath11 0.00002 gev/@xmath12 which is comparable to the mass of lightest baryons @xmath13 ( 0.938 gev/@xmath12 ) and @xmath14 ( 1.115 gev/@xmath12 )  @xcite .",
    "the life time of the @xmath0 meson is @xmath15 42 fm/@xmath16 . because of longer life time , the @xmath0 meson will mostly decay outside the fireball and therefore its daughters will not have much time to re - scatter in the hadronic phase .",
    "the hadronic interaction cross - section of the @xmath0 meson is expected to have a small value and hence seems to freeze out early compared to other lighter hadrons ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath13 )  @xcite .",
    "therefore its production should be less affected by the later stage hadronic interactions in the evolution of the system formed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "+ the elliptic flow parameter @xmath1 is a good tool for studying the system formed in the early stages of high energy collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "it describes the momentum anisotropy of particle emission from non - central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is defined as the second harmonic coefficient of the fourier decomposition of azimuthal distribution with respect to the reaction plane angle ( @xmath19 ) and can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath0 is emission azimuthal angle  @xcite .",
    "although the elliptic flow is early time phenomena but its magnitude might still be affected by the later stage hadronic interaction .",
    "since the hadronic interaction cross section of @xmath0 meson is smaller than the other hadrons , its @xmath1 remains almost unaffected by the late stage interaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath0-meson @xmath1 will reflect the collective motion of the partonic phase .",
    "these make the @xmath0 meson a clean probe for the study of the qcd phase diagram in the beam energy scan ( bes ) program at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected from au+au collisions at @xmath2= 7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev with the star detector for minimum bias trigger in the years of 2010 and 2011 .",
    "the cuts on primary vertex position along the longitudinal beam direction ( @xmath21 ) is 30 cm for 200 gev , 40 cm for 39 and 62.4 gev , 50 cm for 11.5 gev and 70 cm for 7.7 , 19.6 and 27 gev gev data set .",
    "an additional cut on vertex radius @xmath22 2 cm has been used to reject contamination from beam pipe interaction . the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and time of flight ( tof ) detectors with full azimuthal coverage",
    "were used for particle identification in the central pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath23 ) region ( @xmath24 1.0 ) . for spectra analysis",
    "we have used only the tpc where as for elliptic flow analysis both tpc and tof detectors have been used .",

    "the value of @xmath30 is calculated from the monte carlo glauber simulation  @xcite .",
    "if nucleus - nucleus collisions are simply a superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions then @xmath3 is equal to one .",
    "deviation of @xmath3 from the unity would imply contribution fron the nuclear medium effects .",
    "because of the energy loss of the partons traversing the high density qcd medium , the @xmath3 of @xmath0 mesons goes below unity at 200 gev  @xcite . from fig . 1 , one can see at the intermediate @xmath7 ( @xmath7 @xmath31 1.5 gev / c ) , @xmath3 @xmath4 1.0 for @xmath2 @xmath5 39 gev .",
