    "quantum measurements are inevitable parts of all quantum devices @xcite . in many situations ,",
    "the choice of a particular measurement depends on the task to be performed . for instance , in the case of quantum - state discrimination the choice of the generalized measurement is given by the specific pair of states that are supposed to be discriminated .",
    "recently universal ( multi - purpose ) quantum measurement devices , `` quantum multimeters '' , were introduced and discussed in several papers @xcite . their key property is the possibility to control the choice of the measurement by a quantum state of the program register , which could be in principle unknown . the quantum states of a program register corresponding to different measurements are allowed to be mutually non - orthogonal .    in this paper , we report on the experimental realization of a programmable quantum - state discriminator ( section [ discriminator ] ) and a phase - covariant multimeter ( section [ multimeter ] ) .",
    "both programmable detectors involve two qubits , one data qubit and one program qubit . in our optical implementation ,",
    "the qubits are encoded into polarization states of single photons and the required photon pairs are generated by means of spontaneous parametric downconversion .",
    "the experiment exploits the fact that a partial bell measurement on polarization states of two photons can be accomplished with linear optics , namely a balanced beamsplitter and two polarizing beamsplitters , followed by photodetectors @xcite .",
    "a general _ unknown _ quantum state can not be determined completely by a measurement performed on a single copy of the system .",
    "but the situation is different if _ a priori _ knowledge is available @xcite ",
    "e.g. , if one works only with states from a certain discrete set .",
    "even quantum states that are mutually non - orthogonal can be distinguished with a certain probability provided they are linearly independent ( for a review see ref .",
    "there are , in fact , two different optimal strategies @xcite : first , the strategy that determines the state with the minimum probability for the error @xcite and , second , unambiguous or error - free discrimination ( the measurement result never wrongly identifies a state ) that allows the possibility of an inconclusive result ( with a minimal probability in the optimal case ) @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate our attention to the unambiguous state discrimination .",
    "it has been first investigated by ivanovic @xcite for the case of two equally probable non - orthogonal states .",
    "peres @xcite solved the problem of discrimination of two states in a formulation with povm measurement . later jaeger and shimony @xcite extended the solution to arbitrary a priori probabilities .",
    "chefles and barnett @xcite have generalized peres s solution to an arbitrary number of equally probable states which are related by a symmetry transformation .",
    "unambiguous state discrimination was already realized experimentally .",
    "the first experiment , designed for the discrimination of two linearly polarized states of light , were done by huttner _",
    "the interest in the quantum state discrimination is not only `` academic ''  unambiguous state discrimination can be used , e.g. , as an efficient attack in quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "let us now suppose that we want to discriminate unambiguously between two non - orthogonal states .",
    "however , we would like to have a possibility to `` switch '' the apparatus in order to be able to work with several different pairs of states . the switching should be realized by preparing a program register of the programmable discriminator in different program states .",
    "the program state thus specifies which pair of quantum states is discriminated by the device .",
    "this problem was investigated theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us have two ( non - orthogonal ) input states of a qubit that should be discriminated : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent two `` logical '' levels of a qubit , in particular horizontal and vertical linear polarizations of a photon ; subscript d stays for `` data '' .",
    "note that these states are supposed to be symmetrically located around the state @xmath3 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fi_pm ] . in addition",
    "let us have a program qubit in a state ( index p denotes `` program '' ) : @xmath4 choosing properly the state of a program qubit and performing a suitable joint measurement on the data and program qubits together one can unambiguously discriminate any two states of the data qubit that are in agreement with the program .",
    "let us suppose that the state of the program qubit is equal to one of the two states that shall be error - free discriminated . in particular ,",
    "let @xmath5 then the total state of the data and program qubit reads @xmath6 , &   \\label{total}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 are the bell states . clearly , if we were able to detect bell states @xmath8 and @xmath9 we could unambiguously discriminate states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the probability of successful discrimination would be @xmath12 this probability of success is not optimal in general . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the optimal probability of successful discrimination @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the probability ( [ probab ] ) corresponds to a `` quasi - classical '' discrimination . by a quasi - classical approach we mean a probabilistic measurement when one randomly selects the projective measurement in one of two bases that both span the two - dimensional space containing both non - orthogonal states of interest ( [ data ] ) .",
    "one basis consists of the state @xmath14 and its orthogonal complement @xmath15 .",
    "if one finds the result corresponding to @xmath16 he / she can be sure that the state @xmath17 was not present .",
    "analogously , the other basis consists of the state @xmath18 and its orthogonal complement .    to get a higher probability of success one would have to make a more sophisticated measurement than a simple bell - state analysis @xcite .",
    "however , there are two important points concerning the proposed discrimination procedure : first , a partial measurement in the bell basis can be easily realized by linear optics .",
    "namely , states @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be distinguished ( the rest of the bell states corresponds to an inconclusive result anyway ) .",
    "second , our aim is not to maximize the success probability but to demonstrate experimentally the possibility to control the discrimination process by the _",
    "quantum state _ of a program qubit .",
    "even to set the bases for the mentioned quasi - classical discrimination correctly , one needs an infinite number of bits of classical information .",
    "our procedure requires only _ a single qubit _ for the same job .",
    "this fact reveals the _ quantum nature _ of the programming .",
    "even non - orthogonal states of the quantum qubit carry `` useful information '' for the discrimination process .",
    "the scheme of our experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ schema ] . a krypton - ion cw laser ( 413.1  nm , 95 mw )",
    "is used to pump a 10-mm - long liio@xmath19 nonlinear crystal cut for degenerate type - i parametric downconversion .",
    "we exploit the fact that the pairs of photons generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) manifest tight time correlations ( i.e. , very exact coincidences of detection instants ) . in our setup",
    "the photons produced by spdc have horizontal linear polarizations .",
    "different polarization states are prepared by means of half - wave and quarter - wave plates ( hwp , qwp ) .",
    "the polarization of the signal photon represents the data qubit whilst the polarization of the idler photon serves as the program qubit .",
    "the two photons impinge on two input ports of a 50/50 beamsplitter ( bs , non - polarizing cube beamsplitter ) .",
    "a scanning mirror is used in one interferometer arm in order to balance the length of both arms , as indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",
    "the photons reflected and transmitted by bs pass polarizing beamsplitters ( pbs , polarizing cube beamsplitter ) to distinguish horizontal and vertical polarizations . finally , the beams are filtered by cut - off filters and circular apertures , and coupled into multi - mode optical fibers by lenses .",
    "detectors d@xmath20,  ,d@xmath21 are perkin - elmer single - photon counting modules ( employing silicon avalanche photodiodes with quantum efficiency @xmath22% and dark counts about 100s@xmath23 ) .",
    "the signals from detectors are processed by our home - made 4-input coincidence module . with this setup , visibilities of hong - ou - mandel dip",
    "@xcite exceeding 92% were reached for vertically polarized photons ( for other polarizations visibilities were slightly lower ) .",
    "higher visibilities could not be reached due to the fact that the splitting ratios of the coupler were not exactly 50/50 and due to the imperfections of the wave plates and polarization distortions on mirrors .    as already mentioned our experiment",
    "is based on the possibility to detect the two particular bell states in the hilbert space of the polarization states of two photons .",
    "this task can be done by means of passive linear optical elements , namely by a beamsplitter and two polarization beamsplitters as shown in fig .",
    "[ schema ] @xcite .    the simplest theoretical model of the beamsplitter leads to the conclusion that if one fetches bell states at the inputs the only one of them that results in a coincident detection at two different outputs of the beamsplitter is the singlet state @xmath9",
    "however , in case of the `` real '' beam - splitting cube one must take into account that the two photons strike upon a beamsplitter in opposite directions .",
    "so , if the mutual phase of the vertical components of the electric - field vectors at the interface plane ( we mean the vectors corresponding to the fields coming from the two opposite inputs ) is @xmath24 the mutual phase of the horizontal components is @xmath25 just for _ geometrical _ reasons .",
    "it means , if one prepares both photons in the _ same _ linear polarizations tilted by @xmath26 with respect to the plane of incidence the vectors of electric field at the interface plane will oscillate in mutually _",
    "perpendicular _ directions .",
    "consequently , now it is the triplet state @xmath8 that leads to a coincident detection at different outputs .",
    "so , if detectors d@xmath20 and d@xmath19 or d@xmath27 and d@xmath21 click together in our setup the state @xmath8 is detected ( at the input of the beamsplitter )  this corresponds to the recognition of state @xmath14 .",
    "if detectors d@xmath20 and d@xmath27 or d@xmath19 and d@xmath21 click in coincidence the state @xmath9 was `` present '' in the input  so , @xmath28 is detected .",
    "if both photons enter the same detector either @xmath29 or @xmath30 was `` present '' in the input  this represents the inconclusive result of the discrimination .",
    "each data point at presented plots has been derived from 10 one - second measurement periods .",
    "the accuracy of polarization - angle settings was better than @xmath31 .",
    "we tried to discriminate a broad variety of pairs of elliptically polarized states @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the half - axes of the polarization ellipse and @xmath35 is the angle between horizontal axis and the direction of @xmath33-half - axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fi_pm ] ) . the ellipticity @xmath36 .",
    "we started with linear polarizations ( @xmath37 ) and then proceeded with elliptical polarizations with three different ellipticities ( namely for @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath35 was , in all the cases , scanned from @xmath40 to @xmath41 with the step of @xmath42 .",
    "elliptical polarizations ( corresponding to states @xmath43 ) were produced from horizontal ones by means of a quarter - wave plate rotated by angle @xmath44 with respect to the horizontal axis .",
    "then the direction of the @xmath33-half - axis of the polarization ellipse was tilted by a half - wave plate rotated by @xmath45 .",
    "let us recall that the theoretical probability of successful discrimination of states ( [ elipt ] ) is @xmath46    figure  [ lin_coinc ] shows the coincidence rates measured for linear polarization states .",
    "the upper part shows the measurement of bell states @xmath8 and @xmath9 when the data and program states coincide ( i.e. , the input state is @xmath47 ) , the lower part shows the same measurement in case when they are different ( i.e. , the input state is @xmath48 ) .",
    "statistical errors are smaller than the symbols of points . graphs in fig .",

    "this value is approximately the same for all measured polarizations .",

    "as can be seen the data are in a good agreement with the theory .",
    "the probability of success is calculated as an average of normalized detection rates corresponding to successful events ( i.e. , correct conclusive measurement results ) for two possible input states ( that are in correspondence with the program state ) .",
    "the averaging takes into account that both the inputs @xmath60 appear with the same probability @xmath61 .",
    "the `` normalization '' means that the detection rate is divided by the pair - generation rate , i.e. , by the number of all measurement events per time unit .",
    "this quantity is obtained from the coincidence measurement on the shoulder @xmath62 m out of the dip ( see fig .",
    "[ dip ] ) . in this situation",
    "the two one - photon packets generated by downconversion no longer overlap at the beamsplitter and each of them randomly `` decides '' whether to go through or to be reflected .",
    "as the splitting ratio of the used beamsplitter is slightly different for vertical and horizontal linear polarizations the normalization measurements were done with @xmath26 linear polarization states at the inputs .",

    "the given @xmath26 polarizations both these two rates outside the dip should be equal to @xmath65 of the pair - generation rate .",
    "however , there could be deviations from this @xmath65 due to the non - ideal splitting ratio of the beamsplitter . nevertheless , the sum of these two quantities is immune against this imperfection and proportional to @xmath61 of the pair - generation rate .",

    "these quantities were always measured just before , or just after the corresponding set of main measurements in order to minimize the influence of the long - term fluctuations ( like a laser - power drift etc . ) .",
    "the errors derived from the statistical fluctuations of individual detection rates are smaller than the symbols of points in fig .",
    "[ p_succ ] .",
    "the systematic error ( the shift of all the data values ) is due to non - unit visibility .",
    "now we will consider a different kind of quantum multimeter .",
    "namely such one that can perform von neumann measurements on a single qubit in any basis @xmath69 located on the equator of the bloch sphere , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is arbitrary . the particular measurement basis is selected by a quantum state of a program register .",
    "it is impossible to perfectly encode such projective measurements into states in finite - dimensional hilbert space @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to encode povms that represent , in a certain sense , the best approximation of the required projective measurements . a specific way of approximation of a projective measurement is a `` probabilistic '' measurement that allows for some inconclusive results . in this case , instead of a two - component projective measurement one has a three - component povm and the third outcome corresponds to an inconclusive result .",

    "i.e. , we will treat randomly selected ( with probability @xmath93 ) inconclusive results as results `` @xmath94 '' or `` @xmath95 '' ( at random ) .",

    "in particular , we emphasize that a classical setting of the angle between the states that shall be unambiguously discriminated and a classical description of the measurement basis in case of projective phase - covariant measurement would require infinitely many bits of classical information , while only one quantum bit suffices in the present case to obtain an _ error - free _ ( although probabilistic ) operation .    the authors would like to thank to martin hendrych and miroslav jeek for their help and advises in the preparatory stage of the experiment .",
