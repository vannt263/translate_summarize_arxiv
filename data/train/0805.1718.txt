    "rhic also increased its luminosity by a better understanding of the machine and new techniques like stochastic cooling .",
    "rhic is likely the most versatile heavy ion collider in the world and has collided in its first 8 years 4 different species at 6 different beam energies .",

    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "several new detectors had been added over the past years to improve pid , the measurement of the reaction plane ( rp ) and @xmath1 identification at forward angles .            a time - of - flight ( tof - w ) detector , based on multi - gap resistive plate chambers ( mrpc ) @xcite ,",
    "was added to the phenix west central arm detector in 2007 to extend the pid to higher momenta , i.e. above 2 - 3 gev / c . before the pid in the phenix west arm relied on a combination of a gas ring image cherenkov ( rich ) vessel , an aerogel detector ( n=1.0114 ) , and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) which left a gap in the pion to kaon separation between 3 and 5 gev / c .",

    "several new results based on this detector have been presented at this conference @xcite .",
    "for a few years phenix will use the new reaction plane detector ( rxnp ) @xcite to further improve the rp measurement and to improve triggering at lower energies when the bbc and zero  degree  calorimeters ( zdc ) are not efficient enough .",
    "the rxnp consists of 2x2 rings with 12 scintillator counters each , read out by 2x24 photomultipliers .",
    "it covers the pseudorapidity windows @xmath2 .    seeking to extend the detector coverage into the forward direction , phenix installed 412  pbwo@xmath3 crystals into the forward tips , @xmath4 , of each magnet piston in the north and south muon magnets .",

    "its a windowless cherenkov detector using pure @xmath5 with a triple gem readout , where the top most layer is coated with cesium iodide ( csi ) to convert the cherenkov photons into photo - electrons which are in turn amplified by the gem with a gain of @xmath6 .",

    "a long proven approach to study the dynamics of a heavy ion collisions is a hanbury - brown and twiss , hbt , analysis @xcite .",
    "phenix presented first results in reconstructing the shape and dynamical evolution of the particle emitting source by a 3dimensional source imaging technique @xcite .",
    "another method to estimate the source size is to measure the coalescence parameter , @xmath13 , for deuterons @xcite .",
    "using the above mentioned tof - w detector phenix could extend the existing ( anti ) deuteron measurements to higher @xmath14 and multiple centrality bins . expressing the coalescence probability , @xmath15 is a measure of the source radius .",
    "it increases linearly with the number of participating nucleons in the collision , and the extracted radius parameter is compatible with hbt results on pion pairs .",
    "a most surprising observation at rhic was the strong elliptic flow , which lead to the conclusion that the medium we are studying does not behave like a hot gas but rather like a strongly coupled liquid .",
    "when colliding at intermediate impact parameters the overlap region between the two nuclei is elliptically shaped in the transverse plane .",
    "this spacial anisotropy creates a pressure gradient which translates into a momentum anisotropy in the final particle stage .",
    "experimentally this is measured via the @xmath9 angular distribution of the particles with respect to the reaction plane angle , @xmath16 , of the event which is defined by the beam direction and the distance vector of the center of the two nuclei @xcite , and a fourier decomposition . @xmath17   \\label{dndphi}\\]]because of the symmetry @xmath18 in the collision geometry",

    "it has been observed that the @xmath22 of all studied particles scales as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of quarks in the particle and @xmath25 is the transverse kinetic energy .",
    "this scaling was observed up to @xmath26 , an indication that hydrodynamical description of the data was valid @xcite .",
    "new data from phenix @xcite indicate that this is not valid above 1  gev / c which corresponds to @xmath27 for a proton , the region where hard scattering becomes important .",
    "the next higher term @xmath28 is an important measure if a ideal hydrodynamical description is applicable in this momentum range .",

    "a phenix result on @xmath35 is to be presented soon , see @xcite for more details .    instead of a fourier transform of the angular particle distribution with respect to the reaction plane , a cumulant technique @xcite can also be used to extract the anisotropic flow strength .",
    "the detectors used for the rp determination in phenix have a large enough rapidity gap to the tracking and pid detectors that non - flow effects are not important , a direct comparison should then indicate where non  flow effects set in .",
    "the cumulant @xmath22 starts to diverge from the rp @xmath33 at @xmath36 , indicating that non  flow effects , e.g. jets from hard scattering , become important .",

    "the correlation functions have to be corrected for background and flow , which in itself is an angular correlation .",

    " p ( open points ) and close to the inclusive spectra ( lines ) .",
    "this indicates that the momentum distributions of these particles has been softened by passing through the medium .    if the particle distributions and momenta are affected by their passage through the collision medium than the distributions when measured along the long versus the short axis of the collisions ellipsoid should be different",
