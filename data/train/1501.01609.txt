    "combination of laser doppler holography  @xcite with transmission microscopy is proposed to analyze blood in fish embryos .",
    "we have adapted a laser doppler holographic setup to a standard bio - microscope by carrying the two beams ( illumination of the object and reference ) with optical fibers .",
    "multimodal acquisition and analysis of the data is made by adjusting the reference versus illumination frequency offset and the shape of the filtering zone in the fourier space .",
    "considering the same set of data , we have extracted amplitude contrast of the whole fish embryo , or only the moving blood vessels .",
    "images where the flow direction is coded in rgb color are obtained .",
    "our digital holography set - up consists in a mach - zehnder interferometer in which the recombining cube beam splitter is angularly tilted .",
    "the interferometer is split into an injection ( a ) and a recombination ( b ) part , which are connected , using optical fibers , to a classical upright microscope ( fig.[setup ] ) .",
    "the injection part ( fig . [ setup](a ) ) is used to build both object illumination ( field @xmath0 ) and reference ( or local oscillator ( lo ) @xmath1 ) beams .",
    "phase shifting interferometry and frequency scanning of the holographic detection frequency are made possible using the heterodyne holography method @xcite .",
    "the reference arm is thus frequency shifted by using two acousto - optic modulators aom1 and aom2 , operating at a controlled angular frequency difference @xmath2 .",
    "reference and object fields are injected into two mono - mode optical fibers .",
    "the object is imaged by a microscope objective ( mo : na= 0.25 , g=10 ) , mounted on an upright microscope ( fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) ) . the illumination field ( @xmath0 )",
    "is scattered by the studied fish embryo ( zebrafish ) yielding the signal field ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "signal ( @xmath3 ) and reference ( @xmath4 ) fields are combined using an angularly tilted beam splitter cube ( bs ) .",
    "interferences ( i.e. @xmath5 ) between both fields are recorded on a 1360@xmath61024 pixel ( 6.45 @xmath7 m square pitch ) 12-bits ccd camera operating at @xmath8 .",
    "recorded data are cropped to @xmath9 for fft ( fast fourier transform ) calculations .",
    "all the driving signals are synchronized by a common 10 mhz clock .",
    "+    figure [ fig_bw ] illustrates our reconstruction procedure @xcite with non - doppler shifted images .",
    "we have considered here four phase holograms : @xmath10 ( see fig . [ fig_bw](a ) ) where @xmath11 .. @xmath12 are 4 successive camera frames .",
    "@xmath13 is refocused in the objective pupil plane leading to @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the fft operator , and @xmath16 is the propagation distance to refocus over the pupil ( fig . [ fig_bw](b ) ) .",
    "the pupil image is then cropped and recentered leading to @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_bw](c ) ) and the complex object field @xmath18 is extracted by @xmath19 $ ] .    due to the red blood cell ( rbc ) motion , the light passing through the zebrafish undergoes a doppler shift @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the illumination and scattered wavevectors , and @xmath23 is the velocity . to measure the doppler shift due to scatterer motion , we have swept the detection frequency @xmath2 from 0 to 120 hz , and calculated two - phases holograms @xmath24 for each frequency point .    to assess for the norm of the velocity vector , the signal",
    "is averaged over different zones the reconstructed image .",
    "obtained results are depicted fig .",
    "[ fig_curve ] for zones labeled in the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig_curve](a ) .",
    "by estimating the half - width at half - maximum of each spectra , it is possible to obtain the norm of the velocity vector .    in our experiment ,",
    "the reference arm frequency offset @xmath25 ( which is known ) is close to the doppler shift : @xmath26 , where @xmath21 is know ( @xmath21 is parallel to the @xmath27 axis ) , and where @xmath22 can be selected in the fourier space ( by applying mask to @xmath17 ) ) .",
    "quantitative information on the velocity @xmath23 can thus be obtained .",
    "this point is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig_5k ] and fig [ fig_5 ] . by filtering half of the fourier space ( fig .",
    "[ fig_5k](b ) ) , one can discriminate rbc motion along the @xmath28 direction . by rotating the filtering zone by 0 ( blue ) , @xmath29 ( green ) and @xmath30 ( red )",
    ", one can map in false color the reconstruction space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_5k](c ) ) .    combining the 3 reconstructed holograms ( displayed in blue , green and red ) for the 3 rotations of the filtering zone",
    ", one can obtain an image where the flow - direction is coded in rgb colors .",
    "this point is illustrated fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] where blood flow direction between veins and arteries can be discriminated .",
