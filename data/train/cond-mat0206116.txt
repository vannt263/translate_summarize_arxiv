    "the coupling of the electrons to the quantum lattice vibrations is a key issue in solid state physics . while in the weak coupling limit electrons generally behave as good quasiparticles , in strong coupling regimes electrons may drag the lattice deformation induced by the scattering process . in the latter case ,",
    "the charge carrier is the unit comprising electron and dressing cloud of phonons , namely the polaron @xcite .",
    "a wide literature has been produced on the subject during the last decades @xcite and particular emphasis has been recently laid on the polaronic properties of high @xmath1 superconductors @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations usually start from the holstein molecular crystal model @xcite which assumes a momentum independent coupling of electrons to dispersive optical phonons leading to polaron formation if the energy gain associated with the lattice deformation is larger than the kinetic energy due to the tight binding hopping in the bare band @xcite . as a remarkable feature of the polaron physics @xcite , the strength of the coupling drives the transition from a large size polaron ( at weak couplings ) to a small size polaron ( at strong couplings ) .",
    "this transition @xcite is accompanied by a sizeable enhancement of the effective mass whose value may change considerably according to the degree of adiabaticity and the peculiarities of the lattice structure @xcite . in some systems however @xcite the _ e - ph _",
    "interaction modifies the electron hopping matrix elements thus leading to a momentum dependent coupling function . in this case",
    "an appropriate theoretical framework is offered by the su - schrieffer - heeger(ssh ) model hamiltonian @xcite originally proposed to explain the conducting properties of quasi one dimensional polymers as polyacetylene @xcite whose twofold degenerate ground state sustains well known nonlinear local excitations , the solitons .",
    "more generally , the ssh hamiltonian provides an alternative ( to the holstein model ) tool to analyse the physics of polaron formation as tuned by the strength of the _ e - ph _ coupling in one dimensional systems .",
    "this physics has been less deeply investigated than in the holstein model . with the present paper",
    "we address precisely this question attacking the ssh hamiltonian by a weak coupling perturbative method .",
    "although this approach is clearly not adequate to capture the multiphononic nature of the polaronic quasiparticle , still it can provide useful informations regarding the onset of polaron formation in some portions of parameter space . here",
    "we look first at the mass renormalization exploring a wide range of values for the adiabatic parameter and , successively , we compute the electronic spectral function to detect whether and to which extent bare electrons behave as good quasiparticles .",
    "the section 2 outlines the ssh model and contains the results of this study while some conclusions are drawn in section 3 .",
    "in 1d , the real space ssh hamiltonian reads    @xmath2 \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the nearest neighbors hopping integral for an undistorted chain , @xmath4 is the electron - phonon coupling , @xmath5 is the dimerization coordinate which specifies the displacement of the @xmath6 lattice site from the equilibrium position along the molecular axis , @xmath7 is the momentum operator conjugate to @xmath5 , @xmath8 is the ion ( ionic group ) mass , @xmath9 is the effective spring constant , @xmath10 and @xmath11 create and destroy electrons on the @xmath6 site .",
    "let s expand the lattice displacement and its conjugate momentum in terms of the phonon creation and annihilation operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 and fourier transform the electron operators    @xmath14    in order to obtain the ssh hamiltonian in momentum space :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "the phonon dispersion relation is defined in the range @xmath17 $ ] . assuming a reduced brillouin zone ( @xmath18 ) the spectrum displays both an acoustic and an optical branch @xcite .",
    "the model contains three free parameters : the hopping integral @xmath3 , the zone boundary frequency @xmath19 which coincides with the zone center optical frequency in the reduced zone scheme , the coupling constant @xmath20 .",
    "the full electron propagator in the matsubara green s functions formalism is defined as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the inverse temperature , @xmath23 is the time ordering operator , @xmath24 indicates that thermodynamic averages are taken with respect to the unperturbed hamiltonian and only different connected diagrams contribute to any order @xmath25 .",
    "i have computed exactly the self - energy terms due to one phonon ( @xmath26 in eq.(4 ) ) and two phonons ( @xmath27 in eq.(4 ) ) scattering processes which determine the renormalized electron mass @xmath28 through the relations :    @xmath29    where , @xmath30 is the frequency dependent real part of the retarded self - energy .",
    "there are three contributions due to different connected two - phonons diagrams @xcite .",
    "their effect is however confined to the intermediate regime in which @xmath31 is comparable to the electronic energy @xmath3 . here",
    "the two phonons diagrams enhance the effective mass by @xmath32 with respect to the one phonon result . instead ,",
    "in the fully adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes the two phonons contributions ( evaluated at the band bottom ) are negligible .",
    "hereafter , the displayed results depend on the very one phonon self - energy @xmath33 term ( @xmath34 with @xmath35 integer number ) whose finite temperatures analytic expression is given by :    @xmath36 \\label{6}\\ ] ]    @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the bose and fermi occupation factors respectively .",
    "we take a narrow band system setting @xmath39 .",
    "figure 1 shows a sizeable mass enhancement in the intermediate adiabatic regime with a pronounced spike at @xmath40 mainly due to scattering by @xmath41-phonons .",
    "this feature is related to the 1d electron and phonon dispersion relations and it may be partly suppressed in higher dimensionality .",
    "however the onset of a mass renormalization starting at @xmath42 and , more evidently , at @xmath43 ( together with the increased relevance of multiphonons contributions ) signals that polaron formation is expected in this regime while no mass enhancement is obtained in the adiabatic and antiadiabatic limits .",
    "let s look now at the spectral function defined by @xmath44 to get more insight @xcite into the suggestions proposed by the effective mass behavior . in terms of the retarded self - energy ,",
    "obtained by eq.(6 ) through analytic continuation @xmath45 , @xmath46 reads :    @xmath47 ^ 2 } } \\label{7}\\ ] ]    the first addendum in eq.(7 ) contributes when @xmath48 .",
    "the band bottom ( @xmath49 ) spectral function has been computed in a number of representative cases summing the self - energy term ( eq.(6 ) ) over 6000 @xmath50points in the brillouin zone and searching the zeros of the @xmath51-function argument ( eq.(7 ) ) and @xmath52 over @xmath53 points of the @xmath54 axis .",
    "the sum rule @xmath55 has to be numerically fulfilled in principle .",
    "here however we are approximating the total self - energy by the one - phonon term ( eq.(6 ) ) which linearly depends on the free parameter @xmath20 .",
    "as the _ e - ph _ coupling grows multiphonons terms become more relevant and our approximation becomes less accurate .",
    "accordingly , deviations from the sum rule are expected as a measure of the loss of spectral weight associated with higher order self - energy effects . in this regard , the sum rule numerical analysis permits to define the range of @xmath20 values within which the one phonon approximation is reliable . for any choice of input parameters we are able to estimate the intrinsic error of our physical model .",
    "figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) illustrate that electrons are good quasiparticles in the fully antiadiabatic regime : for both values of the _ e - ph _ coupling there is a well resolved peak due to the @xmath56function contribution and located at @xmath57 ( fig.2(a ) ) and @xmath58 ( fig.2(b ) ) , respectively .",
    "the sum rule is well satisfied in figure 2(a ) while a slight loss of spectral weight ( @xmath59 ) occurs in figure 2(b ) ( where the dimensionless effective coupling is @xmath60 ) , being @xmath61 .",
    "infact , by increasing the _ e - ph _ coupling fourth order diagrams acquire relevance and should contribute to the fulfillement of the sum rule .",
    "figures 3 deal with the intermediate regime @xmath62 .",
    "electrons are still good excitations in the extremely weak coupling case ( fig.3(a ) ) with one well defined transition at @xmath63 but , at larger couplings ( fig.3(b ) ) , the sum rule is far from being satisfied and a @xmath64 loss of spectral weight is observed together with a strong reduction of the main peak height .",
    "here we see the failure of the electronic quasiparticle picture and the possible onset of a polaronic state .",
    "let s come to the adiabatic regime represented in figures 4 . in figure 4(a )",
    "the sum rule is satisfied and the spectral weight spreads mainly in a few peaks around the highest one located at the energy @xmath65 with a significant tail up to energy levels of order @xmath66 . at larger couplings ( fig.4(b ) ) the tail is appreciable up to @xmath67 and the loss of spectral weight is @xmath68 .",
    "a well defined transition is however still present at @xmath69 .",
    "the temperature induced effects on the spectral function of the extremely weak coupling system are shown in figures 5(a ) for the @xmath70 case and 5(b ) for the @xmath71 case , respectively .",
    "comparison with the ground state case ( figure 4(a ) ) emphasizes the progressive broadening of the main peak in a quasi continuum of states which , above room temperature , tend to have similar probabilities .",
    "electrons are expected to be good quasiparticle and natural excitations of a system in which the electron - phonon interaction is weak .",
    "we have studied the su - schrieffer - heeger hamiltonian by a low order perturbative method assuming a coupling energy @xmath20 always smaller than the bare hopping integral @xmath3 which sets the scale of the electron energies .",
    "the effective mass of the charge carriers varies with the degree of adiabaticity of the system : while no renormalization is observed in the adiabatic and antiadiabatic limits , a sizeable enhancement takes place when the phonons compare in energy with the electrons , namely in the intermediate regime .",
    "although the pronounced mass peak may be partly reduced in higher dimensionality exact computations of fourth order diagrams clearly show that multiphonons effects become relevant in the intermediate regime thus signalling that a polaronic behavior may here occur .",
    "analysis of the electronic spectral function corroborates these findings .",
    "more precisely than the effective mass , the electron spectral function , directly measures to which extent electrons are the good excitations of the system in any regime tuned by the adiabaticity parameter .",
    "only one phonon scattering processes have been considered in the presented results .",
    "the spectral function sum rule has been assumed as a benchmark for the reliability of the one phonon approximation and the computed loss of spectral weight have been associated with an increased relevance of multiphonons contributions as a function of the strength of the _ e - ph _ coupling .    while , in the antiadiabatic regime , the system presents well defined electronic transitions again , in the intermediate regime",
    ", electrons cease to be good quasiparticles as soon as the _ e - ph _ coupling grows , although well within a weak coupling scheme .",
    "this is an independent confirmation of the onset of polaronic features suggested by the mass calculation .",
    "also in the moderately adiabatic regime we find that the spectral weight spreads over a region of energy levels but a defined transition is present in the ground state of the system .",
    "the polaronic properties of the model will be next studied in the strong coupling regime thus permitting a comparison with the holstein molecular crystal model .",
    "dimensionality effects will be also investigated .",
