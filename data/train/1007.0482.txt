    "the cosmological observations such as supernovae ia  @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite , large scale structure  @xcite , and weak lensing  @xcite have revealed that the universe has been undergoing an accelerating expansion since the recent `` past '' , which is one of the most challenging problems in physics today .",
    "there are two representative approaches to explain the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "one is the introduction of `` dark energy '' in the framework of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "the other is the consideration of a modified gravitational theory , such as @xmath1 gravity  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we will concentrate on the later approach .",
    "it has been commonly adopted that a viable @xmath1 gravity model needs to satisfy the following conditions : ( a ) positivity of the effective gravitational coupling , ( b ) stability of cosmological perturbations  @xcite , ( c ) asymptotic behavior to the standard @xmath2-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath3 ) model in the large curvature regime , ( d ) stability of the late - time de sitter point  @xcite , ( e ) constraints from the equivalence principle , and ( f ) solar - system constraints  @xcite .",
    "several viable models have been constructed in the literature , such as the popular ones : ( i ) hu - sawicki  @xcite , ( ii ) starobinsky  @xcite , ( iii ) tsujikawa  @xcite , and ( iv ) the exponential gravity  @xcite models with the explicit forms shown in table  [ table ] .    0.2 in [ table ]",

    "@xcite .",
    "recently , the cosmological observational data  @xcite also seems to indicate the crossing of the phantom divide @xmath0 of the equation of state for dark energy in the near `` past '' . to understand such a crossing ,",
    "many attempts have been made .",
    "the most noticeable one is to use a phantom field with a negative kinetic energy term  @xcite .",
    "clearly , it surfers a serious problem as it is not stable at the quantum level . on the other hand , the crossing of the phantom divide can also be realized in the above viable @xmath1 models  @xcite without violating any stability conditions .",
    "this is probably the most peculiar character of the modified gravitational models .",
    "other @xmath1 gravity models with realizing a crossing  @xcite as well as multiple crossings  @xcite of the phantom boundary have also been examined .",
    "however , most of the studies in @xmath1 gravity have been focused on the past . in this paper",
    ", we would like to explore the future behaviors of the universe .",
    "in particular , we show that the viable @xmath1 models generally exhibit the crossings of the phantom divide in the `` future '' too .",
    "in addition , we investigate the future evolution of the cosmological horizon entropy and demonstrate that the cosmological horizon entropy oscillates with time due to the oscillation of the hubble parameter .",
    "we use units of @xmath4 and denote the gravitational constant @xmath5 by @xmath6 with the planck mass of @xmath7gev .",
    "we assume the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time with the metric , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the scale factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain @xmath1 gravity and derive the gravitational field equations . we investigate the cosmological evolution in sec .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec .  iv .",
    "the action of @xmath1 gravity with matter is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the action of matter which is assumed to be minimally coupled to gravity , i.e. , the action @xmath14 is written in the jordan frame , and @xmath15 denotes matter fields . here",
    ", we use the standard metric formalism . by taking the variation of the action in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) with respect to @xmath12 , one obtains  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the einstein tensor , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the covariant derivative operator associated with @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the covariant dalembertian for a scalar field , and @xmath22 is the contribution to the energy - momentum tensor from all perfect fluids of matter . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , we obtain the following gravitational field equations : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hubble parameter , the dot denotes the time derivative of @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the energy density and pressure of all perfect fluids of matter , respectively .",
    "we analyze the cosmological evolution of dark energy including those of non - relativistic matter ( cold dark matter and baryon ) and radiation by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) and @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , we examine the equation of state for dark energy , given by @xmath29\\ , ,   \\nonumber\\\\   p_{\\mathrm{de } } { & \\hspace{-0.2em}=\\hspace{-0.2em } & } \\frac{1}{\\kappa^2 }   \\left [   -\\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( fr - f \\right )   + \\ddot{f}+2h \\dot{f } -\\left(1-f\\right)\\left(2\\dot{h}+3h^2\\right )   \\right]\\ , ,   \\label{eq : w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the future , i.e. , the region with the redshift @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the evolution of the cosmological horizon entropy .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible to obtain a picture of equilibrium thermodynamics on the apparent horizon in the flrw background for @xmath1 gravity due to a suitable redefinition of an energy momentum tensor of the `` dark '' component that respects a local energy conservation in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this picture , the horizon entropy @xmath31  @xcite where @xmath32 is the area of the apparent horizon , is simply expressed as  @xcite @xmath33 we note that in the context of modified gravity theories including @xmath1 gravity , a horizon entropy @xmath34 associated with a noether charge has been proposed by wald  @xcite , given by  @xcite @xmath35 .",

    "note that the present time is @xmath55 and the future is @xmath56 .",
    "the parameters used for each model in figs .",
    "13 are the viable ones  @xcite .",
    "several remarks are as follows : ( a ) the qualitative results do not strongly depend on the values of the parameters in each model ; ( b ) the evolutions of the wald entropy @xmath34 are similar to @xmath52  @xcite in the models of ( i)(iv ) ; and ( c ) we have studied the appleby - battye model  @xcite , which is also a viable @xmath1 model , and we have found that the numerical results are similar to those in the starobinsky model of ( ii ) as expected .",
    "we note that the present values of @xmath57 are -0.92 , -0.97 , -0.92 and -0.93 for the models of ( i)(iv ) , respectively .",
    "these values satisfy the present observational constraints  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a dimensionless quantity @xmath58 can be determined through the numerical calculations , where @xmath59 is the energy density of non - relativistic matter at the present time .",
    "if we use the observational data on the current density parameter of non - relativistic matter @xmath60 with @xmath61  @xcite , we find that the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath62 is @xmath63  @xcite for all the models of ( i)(iv ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , for the models of ( i)(iv ) , respectively , where @xmath39 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "13 that in the future ( @xmath68 ) , the crossings of the phantom divide are the generic feature for all the existing viable @xmath1 models . by writing the first future crossing of the phantom divide and the first sign change of @xmath69 from negative to positive as @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ", respectively , we find that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where the subscript @xmath76 represents the @xmath76th viable model .",
    "the values of the ratio @xmath77 at @xmath70 and @xmath71 are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the density parameters of dark energy and non - relativistic matter ( cold dark matter and baryon ) , respectively .",
    "as @xmath84 decreases ( @xmath85 ) , dark energy becomes much more dominant over non - relativistic matter ( @xmath86 ) . as a result , one has @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the effective equation of state for the universe , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the total energy density and pressure of the universe , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are the energy density of non - relativistic matter ( radiation ) and the pressure of radiation , respectively .",
    "the physical reason why the crossing of the phantom divide appears in the farther future ( @xmath85 ) is that the sign of @xmath69 changes from negative to positive due to the dominance of dark energy over non - relativistic matter .",
    "as @xmath93 in the farther future , @xmath94 oscillates around the phantom divide line @xmath0 because the sign of @xmath69 changes and consequently multiple crossings can be realized .",
    "we remark that since @xmath95 , the oscillating behavior of @xmath52 comes from that of @xmath96 .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that although @xmath52 decreases in some regions , the second law of thermodynamics in @xmath1 gravity can be always satisfied because @xmath52 is the cosmological horizon entropy and it is not the total entropy of the universe including the entropy of generic matter .",
    "it has been shown that the second law of thermodynamics can be verified in both phantom and non - phantom phases for the same temperature of the universe outside and inside the apparent horizon in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that in our numerical calculations , we have taken the initial conditions of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the models of ( i)(iv ) at @xmath101 , respectively , so that @xmath102 with @xmath103 , to ensure that they can be all close enough to the @xmath3 model with @xmath104 .",
    "we note that in order to save the calculation time , the different values of @xmath105 mainly reflect the forms of the models , i.e. , the power - law types of ( i ) and ( ii ) and the exponential ones of ( iii ) and ( iv ) .",
    "it is clear that the smaller @xmath106 is , the closer the model to @xmath3 .",
    "however , the cut off of @xmath102 is assumed to evade the divergence of the calculations in the computing program .",
    "we have also checked the results under the initial conditions with @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 as the @xmath3 values at the same redshift up to @xmath111 in the models of ( i)(iv ) and found that they are qualitatively similar .",
    "we remark that at @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "since @xmath114 in the high @xmath84 regime ( @xmath115 ) , the value of the combination @xmath116 is set as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 corresponds to @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 for ( i ) hu - sawicki ( @xmath46 ) , ( ii ) starobinsky , ( iii ) tsujikawa and ( iv ) the exponential gravity models , respectively , and @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the reason is as follows . in the high @xmath84 regime ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "@xmath114 , in which @xmath1 gravity has to be very close to the @xmath3 model , @xmath123 , where @xmath2 is the effective cosmological constant in the limit of @xmath114 . as an initial condition , we take @xmath124  @xcite .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath117 . since the initial value at @xmath101 of the variable @xmath125 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is an arbitrary one , we have chosen it by using the observational data  @xcite at the present time as @xmath126 .",
    "the physical reason is as follows . by examining the cosmological evolutions of @xmath127 and @xmath94 as functions of the redshift @xmath84 for the models",
    ", we have found that @xmath128 is close to its initial value of @xmath129 .",
    "this is because in the higher @xmath84 regime , the universe is in the phantom phase ( @xmath130 ) and therefore , @xmath131 and @xmath127 increase ( since @xmath132 ) , whereas in the lower @xmath84 regime , the universe is in the non - phantom ( quintessence ) phase ( @xmath133 ) and hence they decrease .",
    "consequently , the above two effects cancel out . to check our numerical results , by using the way in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , we have made another numerical calculation for the model of ( iv ) as follows .",
    "first , by taking a testing value of @xmath116 at an initial value of @xmath134 , we analyze the cosmological evolution numerically .",
    "next , we find the adequate value of @xmath134 so that the current value of @xmath128 can be equal to the present observational value of @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the present energy density of dark energy .",
    "we also obtain the initial value of @xmath129 and the value of @xmath137 with @xmath138 . as a result",
    ", we have found that @xmath139 with @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "furthermore , we have confirmed that the obtained results with the above method are qualitatively similar to the ones shown in figs .",
    "clearly , our results are not sensitive to the initial values of @xmath105 and @xmath129 .",
    "we note that the cosmological evolution of @xmath94 as a function of the redshift @xmath84 for the model of ( iv ) is given in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "on the other hand , the initial condition of @xmath142 is due to that the @xmath1 gravity models at @xmath101 should be very close to the @xmath3 model , in which @xmath143 .",
    "in the present paper , we have explored the future evolution of @xmath94 in the viable @xmath1 gravity models and explicitly shown that in the future the crossings of the phantom divide are the generic feature in these models .",
    "we have also investigated the future evolution of the cosmological horizon entropy and demonstrated that the cosmological horizon entropy oscillates with time because the hubble parameter also does .",
    "the new cosmological ingredient obtained in this study is that in the future the sign of @xmath69 changes from negative to positive due to the dominance of dark energy over non - relativistic matter . this is a common physical phenomena to the existing viable @xmath1 models and",
    "thus it is one of the peculiar properties of @xmath1 gravity models characterizing the deviation from the @xmath3 model .",
