    "mass loss with rates near @xmath1 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase is important both in the evolution of the mass - losing star and in replenishing the interstellar medium ( see , for example , habing 1996 ) . after a star evolves off the agb , its effective temperature rises , its radius shrinks and the wind dies ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 , blocker 1995 , schroder , winters & sedlmayr 1999 )",
    ".    stars slightly beyond the end of their agb evolution can be identified by having only relatively cold dust since they are no longer losing much mass .",
    "therefore , they exhibit a large infrared excess but with dust temperatures typically less than 200 k ( see , for example , kwok 1993 ) . the detached dust shell can be extended over the sky and thus provide the opportunity to examine the history of the star s mass loss .",

    "( 1998 ) have acquired mid - infrared images and resolved more than 10 post - agb stars or  transition objects \" . even in the best - studied cases , the angular diameter of the dust emission is not much larger than the characteristic @xmath9 angular resolution available at the 4m - class telescopes used for these previous studies . with the 10 m keck telescope , it is possible to achieve significantly higher angular resolution ( see , for example , jura & werner 1999 , jura , chen & werner 2000 ) and thus develop more exacting tests of models for dying winds .    here",
    ", we report the result of using keck to obtain mid - ir images of hd 56126 ( m@xmath10 = 8.27 mag , spectral type f5i ) , a post - agb carbon star with a nebula displaying one of the largest angular sizes in the sample studied by meixner et al . and extended optical reflection nebulosity as well ( ueta , meixner & bobrowsky 2000 ) .",

    "we present our conclusions .",
    "our data were obtained on the night 2000 feb 20 ( ut ) at the keck i telescope using the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) which was built by a team led by b. jones and is described on the keck web page .",
    "the lws uses a 128 @xmath2 128 sias bib array with a pixel scale at the keck telescope of 008 and a total field of view of 102 @xmath2 102 .",
    "we used the  chop - nod \" mode of observing , and 4 different filters : 7.5 - 8.2 @xmath7 m , 9.4 - 10.2 @xmath7 m , 11.2 - 12.2 @xmath7 m and 18.4 - 18.9 @xmath7 m .",
    "we used @xmath11 boo for flux and point - spread - function calibrations .",
    "the data were reduced at ucla using standard lws routines .",
    "the image in the 11.7 @xmath7 m filter is presented in figure 1 ; the images at other wavelengths appear similar . probably because of our higher angular resolution ,",
    "our measured peak surface brightness of 4.0 jy arcsec@xmath12 is greater than the peak values of 2.3 jy arcsec@xmath12 and 3.0 jy arcsec@xmath12 found by meixner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and dayal et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , respectively .",
    "given the @xmath110% uncertainties in our data , our measured flux at 11.7 @xmath7 m of 28 jy is consistent with the values for the flux of 30 @xmath13 3 jy ( dayal et al .",

    "the isophotes are smooth and elliptically shaped with the major axis lying near position angle 45@xmath14 and being about 7% greater than the minor axis .",
    "a hint of ellipticity at this position angle is also seen in the mid - ir images of meixner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and dayal et al .",
    "( 1998 ) as well as in the optical reflection nebulosity presented by ueta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in the inner 15",
    "there is a marked change in the morphology of the dust with two bright blobs lying near the minor axis of the ellipse defined by the outer contours .",
    "the bright blob at about 1 to the southeast of the center of the image is seen in the data presented both by dayal et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and meixner et al .",
    "the maximum intensity in the bright blob is about a factor of 1.5 greater than the maximum intensity in the faint blob .",
    "our image at 8@xmath7 m shows that hd 56126 lies within @xmath13 02 of the center of the dust ring defined by the outer , elliptical isophotes .",
    "the observed pulsation properties of hd 56126 can be used to place the star in the h - r diagram and to estimate its mass . since",
    "hd 56126 is variable with a period of 36.8 days ( barthes et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is plausible that the mass of the star is near 0.6 m@xmath4 and the time - averaged luminosity is near 6600 l@xmath4 ( tuchman et al . 1993 , jeannin et al .",
    "1997 , barthes et al .",
    "2000 ) . from the observed time - averaged flux ( see meixner et al .",
    "1997 ) , we therefore infer a distance of 2300 pc . the time - averaged effective temperature , @xmath0 , and radius , @xmath15 , are 5900 k and 5.5 @xmath2 10@xmath16 cm , respectively ( barthes et al . 2000 ) .",
    "although carbon , nitrogen and oxygen have nearly solar abundances , since the iron group elements have abundances about 0.1 of solar ( parthasarathy , garcia lario & pottasch 1992 , klochkova 1995 , van winckel & reyniers 2000 ) , hd 56126 probably is a member of the thick disk and its main sequence progenitor probably had a mass near 1.1 m@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that hd 56126 has already experienced a total mass loss of 0.5 m@xmath4 .",
    "evidence that hd 56126 is a post - agb star is provided by the greater than solar abundance of the s - process elements such as sr , y , zr and ba .",
    "below , we propose that @xmath11500 years ago , hd 56126 was losing @xmath13 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 . in this phase ,",
    "its effective temperature was probably near 2600 k ( arndt et al . 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , during the past 1500 yr , the average value of @xmath6 has been + 2.2 k yr@xmath5 .",
    "the star probably maintained a constant luminosity during its post - agb evolution ( see , for example , vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) so that as the temperature increased , the radius decreased from 2.8 @xmath2 10@xmath17 cm to its current value .",
    "although , as inferred from the profile of the co ( 2 - 1 ) circumstellar emission line , most of the gas outflow is at 10.7 km s@xmath5 ( knapp et al .",
    "1998 ) , there are significant deviations from this value .",
    "crawford & barlow ( 2000 ) have obtained optical spectra with a resolution of 860,000 , and they found three distinct components in the k i circumstellar shell lines with a net spread in the velocity of the circumstellar gas of 2 km s@xmath5 .",
    "to compute the surface brightness , @xmath18 , of the nebulosity , we numerically determine : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the planck function , @xmath21 is the increment of distance along the line of sight , @xmath22 is the dust density at distance , @xmath23 , from the star and the dust opacity is @xmath24 . to compute the dust temperature as a function of the distance ,",
    "we follow sopka et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and assume that the dust grains are heated by the light from the central star and re - radiate in the infrared . for carbon - rich particles ,",
    "we adopt a simple model for the grain opacity , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 g@xmath5 ) such that @xmath26 with @xmath27 = 150 @xmath25 g@xmath5 at @xmath28 = 5 @xmath2 10@xmath16 hz ( 60 @xmath7 m ) ( le bertre 1997 ) .",
    "when the circumstellar envelope is optically thin , the dust grain temperature , @xmath29 , can be written as : @xmath30 with this prescription , @xmath29 at 1@xmath31 from the central star is 170 k while meixner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and dayal et al .",
    "( 1998 ) inferred values of 160 k and 185 k , respectively . for 11.7 @xmath7",
    "m photons , @xmath32 = 1230 k , and therefore the nebulosity is produced by grains emitting on the wien portion of the planck curve .    to compute @xmath22 ,",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric envelope where the dust outflow velocity , @xmath33 , does not change with time .",
    "we assume that the mass loss rate of grains , @xmath34 , and @xmath0 were constant until a moment came when the star s effective temperature started to increase and the wind started to die . during the dying - wind phase , we assume that @xmath6 was constant .",
    "the current boundary between the zone where the wind had a constant mass loss rate and where it started to die , lies at a distance @xmath35 with @xmath35 = @xmath33 @xmath36 . here",
    ", @xmath36 denotes the amount of time that has elapsed since that moment when the star s effective temperature began to increase . from the equation of continuity and the simple mapping between the dust travel time , @xmath37 , and distance from the star , then : @xmath38 in the models for mass loss from carbon - rich agb stars by arndt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , @xmath39 varies as @xmath8 . such a steep variation of the mass loss with temperature occurs because the mass loss rate is controlled by radiation pressure on grains , and the dust formation is very sensitive to the gas temperature .",
    "the best fit to the 11.7 @xmath7 m image shown in figure 1 is with a model derived from equation ( 1 ) where @xmath35 = 5 @xmath2 10@xmath40 cm , corresponding to an angular radius of 15 or @xmath36 = 1500 yr , and @xmath6 = + 2.2 k yr@xmath5 .",
    "we show in figure 2 the results of comparing the results from this model with transverse cuts through the intensity data at 11.7 @xmath7 m . in the region where @xmath23 @xmath41 @xmath35 , the projected 11.7 @xmath7 m intensity depends upon the multiplication of two rapidly varying quantities",
    ": the mass loss rate and the wien portion of the planck function .",
    "the qualitative agreement between our data and the observations lends support to the dying wind model , but other possible models for @xmath42 are not excluded by our observations .    at 1@xmath435 from the star , the 11.7 @xmath7 m intensity of the nebula is about 2.0 jy arcsec@xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in the outer region , @xmath39 = 1.7 @xmath2 10@xmath44 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "although uncertain , a dust to gas ratio of 5 @xmath2 10@xmath45 is plausible and therefore the total mass loss rate before the wind started to die was @xmath13 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 . given the uncertainties in the distance to the star , the dust to gas ratio , the emissivity of the grains and the observations that there is an appreciable amount of carbon in c i as well as co ( bakker et al .",
    "1996 , bakker & lambert 1998 , knapp et al .",
    "2000 ) , this estimate of the mass loss rate for the phase just before the winds dies is consistent with previous estimates by hrivnak et al . ( 1989 ) , meixner et al . ( 1997 ) and dayal et al . ( 1998 ) .",
    "as a first approximation , much of our data can be explained in terms of a nearly - spherical wind of @xmath13 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 which started to die about 1500 yr ago , consistent with models for post - agb evolution of carbon - rich stars ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 , blocker 1995 , schroder et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in order to produce a high enough pressure in the outflow to manufacture tic , von helden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) proposed a short - lived phase with a steady - state mass loss rate of 10@xmath45 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 which is not supported by our data .",
    "nevertheless , models for shock - driven mass loss from agb stars may possibly explain the presence of tic around hd 56126 . in calculations by winters et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a carbon star with a time - averaged mass loss rate of 1.2 @xmath2 10@xmath46 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 , as shown in their figure 2 , at 2 stellar radii above the star , the density can be as high as 10@xmath47 g cm@xmath45 when the gas temperature is 1800 k. therefore , the gas pressure can be @xmath11 dyne cm@xmath12 at a temperature nearly low enough to produce solid tic ( bernatowicz et al .",
    "there may have been phases during the pulsational cycle of hd 56126 while it was on the agb when the physical conditions were favorable for the production of the apparent carrier of the 21 @xmath7 m emission feature even if the mass loss rate was as  low \" as 3 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "the nebula shows significant deviations from spherical symmetry . because the mass loss rate is extremely sensitive to the photospheric temperature",
    ", we tentatively explore the possibility that deviations from spherical symmetry in the dust shell can be explained by temperature variations on the surface of the star while it was losing mass .      as can be seen in figure 1 , beyond 15 from the center , for a given distance from the center , the intensity at position angle 45@xmath14 is greater than at , say , position angle 135@xmath14 . from equation ( 1 ) , if the grain opacity is the same throughout the nebula , then these data can be reproduced either by variations in @xmath50 or by variations in @xmath29 .",
    "the 18.7 @xmath7 m image displays the same ellipticity as does the 11.7 @xmath7 m image so that azimuthal variations in the temperature do not seem to explain the variations in the intensity .",
    "instead , we propose that there are more grains at position angle 45@xmath14 than at position angle 135@xmath14 and thus that there was more mass loss directed toward position angle 45@xmath14 .",
    "if the star is rotating and there is enhanced mass loss at the equatorial bulge ( dorfi & hofner 1996 , soker 1998 , reimers , dorfi & hofner 2000 ) , then qualitatively , the data can be explained if the rotation axis is projected along position angle 135@xmath14 . if @xmath51 varies as @xmath8 then a 1% variation in the temperature can lead to an 8% variation in the mass loss rate  a change great enough to explain the observed 7% ellipticity in the isophotes .    if the surface of the star is an equipotential , if the star rotates as a solid body with angular velocity @xmath52 , and if @xmath53 denotes the co - latitude , then : @xmath54 when the star was on the agb with @xmath0 = 2600 k , @xmath55 = 2.8 @xmath2 10@xmath17 cm and @xmath56 = 0.6 m@xmath4 , and if @xmath57 was @xmath11.02 , consistent with a temperature contrast between the poles and equator of 1.01 and the assumption that @xmath58 is constant over the surface of the star , then @xmath52 was approximately 1 @xmath2 10@xmath59 s@xmath5 .",
    "the angular momentum of the rotating agb star was approximately 2/9 @xmath60 ( soker 1998 ) or 2 @xmath2 10@xmath61 g @xmath25 s@xmath5 .",
    "it is plausible that hd 56126 could have acquired this angular momentum if , when it first swelled onto the agb , it engulfed a putative 0.1 m@xmath4 companion in a circular orbit at 1 au which would then have donated 9 @xmath2 10@xmath61 g @xmath25 s@xmath5 of angular momentum .",
    "an example of a carbon star that has probably engulfed a companion and acquired such a large amount of angular momentum is v hya ( barnbaum , morris & kahane 1995 , kahane et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , we have no evidence in support of the proposed magnitude or orientation of the rotation of hd 56126 , and our hypothesis to explain the observed ellipticity is quite tentative .",
    "meixner et al . (",
    "1997 ) propose that the bright blobs are the consequence of an equatorially - enhanced ejection .",
    "their model implies that the position angle of the rotation axis lies near 45@xmath14 ; a very different orientation from what we propose .",
    "one difficulty with the model by meixner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is that the southeastern blob is considerably brighter than the northwestern blob .",
    "however , it is possible that the bright blob is a factor of 1.2 closer to the central star than the faint blob , and this could explain the intensity difference between the two blobs .",
    "an offset of the central star from the center of the nebula could occur if the system is a wide binary as apparently occurs in tt cyg ( olofsson et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "if , as we propose above , the position angle of the rotation axis is 135@xmath14 , then another model besides that of meixner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is required to explain the existence of the bright blobs .",
    "one possibility is that as the star first evolved away from the agb , the magnetic field was strongest at the rotational poles with the consequence that the gas was particularly cold in these regions .",
    "we speculate that the mass loss continued from the poles for 500 years after it had greatly diminished from the equator .",
    "if the field were stronger at one pole than the other , then the two blobs in the nebula could have different intensities . to appreciably change the surface temperature of the star , the energy density in the magnetic field",
    ", @xmath62 must be comparable to the thermal pressure in the photosphere ( soker & clayton 1999 ) . the required value of the magnetic field is therefore @xmath63^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath64 is the kramers opacity in the atmosphere or @xmath1 3 @xmath2 10@xmath45 @xmath25 g @xmath5 ( soker 1998 ) and @xmath65 is the gravitational acceleration which was near 0.1 cm s@xmath12 when the star was just leaving the agb .",
    "thus a field of @xmath120 gauss is implied . from vlba maps of polarized sio masers ,",
    "magnetic fields approaching this amplitude have been inferred around the oxygen - rich mira variable tx cam ( kemball & diamond 1997 ) , but the true value of the magnetic field is controversial and may be only 0.03 gauss ( wiebe & watson 1998 , desmurs et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we have obtained high - resolution mid - ir images of the detached dust shell around the carbon star hd 56126 and propose the following :    \\1 .",
    "the gross features of the region beyond a radius of 1@xmath66 can be reproduced by an approximately spherical wind from a star which had a mass loss rate of @xmath13 @xmath2 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 while it was on the agb .",
    "after the star left the agb , its effective temperature increased with an average rate of + 2.2 k yr@xmath5 and the mass loss rate varied as @xmath8 , as expected in models for dust - driven winds .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of the mass loss rate to the effective temperature of the star allows us to tentatively propose that both the ellipticity in the outer envelope and the inner blobs can be explained by plausible temperature variations on the surface of the star which might have resulted from rotation and/or large scale magnetic fields .",

    "<S> since the mass loss rate appears to be very sensitive to the effective temperature of the star , we speculate that the observed deviations from spherical symmetry of the dust shell can be explained by plausible variations in the surface temperature of the mass - losing star caused by rotation and/or magnetic fields .    and </S>"
