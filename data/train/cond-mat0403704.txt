    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in hydrated na@xmath7coo@xmath0@xcite has generated renewed interest in this technologically important material .",
    "na@xmath7coo@xmath0 has been known for several years as a potential thermoelectric material which exhibits an unexpectedly large thermoelectric power and at the same time a low resistivity@xcite .",
    "although the origin of the large thermopower remains a subject of active investigation , strong correlations between co @xmath2 electrons and spin entropy are believed to play a critical role@xcite . beside its unusual thermoelectric properties , na@xmath7coo@xmath0 ( @xmath4 in the range 0.5 @xmath8 0.75 )",
    "is also known for having a curie - weiss type of susceptibility instead of a pauli paramagnetic behavior@xcite , which would be more compatible with its metallic conduction@xcite .",
    "although there have been reports of a weak magnetic ordering transition in na@xmath9coo@xmath0 at @xmath10 22 k@xcite , no such transition has been observed down to 2 k for systems with lower na contents .",
    "compared to the vast experimental work that has been done on this material , theoretical study seems to have lagged behind .",
    "first principle calculations of electronic and magnetic properties of strongly correlated systems such as na@xmath7coo@xmath0 have always been a challenge .",
    "although the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) to the density functional theory ( dft ) has been applied to various systems with great success , it is well known that the lsda fails in many aspects when applied to late transition metal oxides in which strong correlations between @xmath2 electrons play an important role .",
    "for example , lsda fails to reproduce the insulating , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state for several transition metal oxides , including the parent materials of high transition temperature ( t@xmath11 ) superconductors .",
    "not surprisingly , there have been several attempts to improve the l(s)da to take into account ( at least partially ) the strong electron - electron interactions in first - principle calculations .",
    "one of the simplest , yet very successful schemes , was proposed by anisimov et al.@xcite : the lda+u method . in this paper",
    ", we present a systematic lsda+u study of doping effects on the electronic and structural properties of na@xmath7coo@xmath0 ( @xmath12 ) using a recently implemented rotationally invariant lsda+u method@xcite within the pseudopotential plane - wave formalism@xcite .",
    "it is now well established that the failure of lsda , when applied to late transition metal oxides , is largely due to an insufficient treatment of on - site coulomb interactions between the rather localized @xmath2 electrons .",
    "lsda attempts to account for the coulomb interaction via an averaged potential depending only on local spin densities .",
    "consequently , magnetic moment formation is driven mainly by the spin polarization energy within lsda .",
    "orbital polarizations , on the other hand , play less important roles in lsda and the occupation of localized orbitals does not depend sensitively on their orientation ( symmetry ) .",
    "for highly localized electrons , however , the coulomb interaction should be applied to the localized orbital as a whole and is better described by the hubbard or hartree - fock ( hf ) type of theory .",
    "the formation of a local moment is therefore a result of both spin and orbital polarizations .",
    "unfortunately , although the hf aproximation and other correlated quantum chemistry methods have been applied to atomic and molecular systems with tremendous success , their application to solids has been limited .",
    "screening effects , which are relatively weak in atoms and molecules , are usually important in solids and can not be easily included within the hf theory .",
    "higher level quantum chemistry calculations , on the other hand , are computationally too expensive for most solids .    the lsda+u method attempts to incorporate the orbital specific screened coulomb interaction while retaining the simplicity of lsda . in lsda+u ,",
    "the energy functional consists of three contributions@xcite : @xmath13= e^{\\mathrm{lsda}}[\\rho^\\sigma({\\bf r})]+e^u[\\{{\\bf n}^\\sigma\\}]-e^{dc}[\\{{\\bf n}^\\sigma\\ } ] , \\label{elsda+u}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the usual lsda energy functional for spin densities @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is a hubbard or hf type of interaction arising from localized electrons ( described by orbital occupation density matrices @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is a `` double - counting '' term to be defined later . in the rotationally invariant lsda+u method@xcite , @xmath17 takes the familiar hf form : @xmath20    where the matrix elements of the screened electron - electron interaction @xmath21 can be expressed approximately as a sum of slater integrals @xmath22 :    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    here @xmath26 is the dielectric constant of the system , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the smallest and largest values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the radial wavefunction of the localized electron .",
    "it should be pointed out that the slater integrals are not well defined in solids and expression ( [ vee ] ) is only an approximation . for @xmath2 electrons ( @xmath32 ) , three slater integrals , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , are needed .",
    "the slater integrals relate to the familiar coulomb ( or hubbard ) @xmath36 and exchange @xmath37 parameters a as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "a further simplication can be achieved by the observation that @xmath40 for most @xmath2-electron systems@xcite .",
    "the slater integrals @xmath22 s ( or equivalently , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) are fixed parameters in our calculations . in principle , however , one could calculate these parameters self - consistently .",
    "the double counting term @xmath41=u\\frac{n(n-1)}{2 } -j[\\frac{n^\\uparrow(n^\\uparrow-1)}{2}+\\frac{n^\\downarrow(n^\\downarrow-1)}{2 } ] \\label{dc}\\ ] ]    is the averaged electron - electron interaction already included in lsda , assuming that lsda gives the overall coulomb and exchange energies correctly .",
    "the double counting term is not uniquely defined and there have been some discussions in the literature concerning other possible forms and their effects on the calculated properties@xcite . in the above expressions , @xmath42tr(@xmath18 ) and @xmath43 , while the density matrix @xmath18 for localized ( e.g. , @xmath2 or @xmath44 ) orbitals remains to be defined .",
    "identifying localized orbitals is trivial in computational methods using atomic basis sets such as the linear muffin - tin orbital method ( lmto ) . in the pseusopotential plane - wave method",
    ", this is less obvious and can be done by projecting the wavefunctions @xmath45 onto pseudoatomic orbitals @xmath46 calculated with an appropriate atomic configuration ( @xmath47 for co in this work ) : @xmath48    we have used the abbreviation @xmath49 . note that proper symmetrizations of the density matrix are needed if the above summation is carried out in the irreducible brillouin zone ( bz ) .",

    ". the occupation matrix @xmath18 and charge density @xmath15 are then constructed for the next iteration until the self - consistency is achieved , while fixing the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "na@xmath7coo@xmath0 assumes a layered structure in which coo@xmath0 and na layers alternate along the @xmath61 axis .",
    "the electronically active coo@xmath0 layer consists of edge sharing coo@xmath62 octahedra with magnetic ( co ) ions forming a frustrated triangular lattice ( see fig .  [ model ] ) .",
    "the oxygen octahedra are distorted considerably - compressed along the body - diagonal direction of the embedding rocksalt structure and stretched in the perpendicular plane .",
    "the distortion presumably depends on the doping level ( as will be shown later ) .",
    "this active coo@xmath0 layer is believed to be responsible for various abnormal electronic , magnetic and transport properties of the system and is the focus of the present study .",
    "the sodium layer is disordered , with na ions distributed among two distinct , partially occupied sites ( wyckoff indices 2@xmath63 and 2@xmath2 ) . in order to avoid inconvenient ( i.e. , large ) unit cells for systems with fractional doping , the effects of na",
    "is modeled by corresponding electron doping into the coo@xmath0 layer in our calculations .",
    "the excess electrons are then balanced by a uniform postive background . in real systems ,",
    "the presence of na potentials and small strains associated with them , as well as interlayer interactions , might have some additional effects on the electronic properties .",
    "we believe , however , our model captures the essential physics and the effects of na ions are minor if not negligible , as will be discussed later .",
    "( alternatively , one may employ the virtual crystal technique to overcome the large unit cell problem . )",
    "our treatment might become even more exact in the case of hydrated compounds since water molecules are likely to screen out the na potentials .",
    "of cource , the interaction between h@xmath0o and coo@xmath0 layers is another issue that deserves further investigations . in our calculations for single layer coo@xmath0",
    ", we fix the in - plane lattice constants @xmath64@xcite , regardless of the doping level . small variation in lattice constants",
    "should have negligible effects on our results .",
    "the separation bewteen layers is set at 6.5   to ensure no significant interlayer interactions .",
    "therefore , the only structural parameter allowed to relax is the oxygen @xmath65 coordinate , which turns out to be rather sensitive to the doping level , as will be discussed later .",
    "the above assumptions significantly simplify our calculations .",
    "there are , however , other difficulties arised in studying correlated systems due to the existence of several competing charge and/or magnetic orderings . since the magnetic and/or charge ordering energies are usually very small , it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between different ordering states based only on their energy difference",
    ". this is particularly true in magnetically frustrated systems such as coo@xmath0 , as is evidenced by experiments where no long range magnetic ordering is observed for na@xmath7coo@xmath0 except for @xmath66@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was suggested that a short range ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering might be preferred in these systems@xcite .",
    "therefore , we will primary concentrate on the ferromagnetic ( paramegtic for @xmath67 ) phase in this paper .",
    "different orderings will be discussed briefly .",
    "we employ the lsda+u method as described in section ii to study doping effects on the electronic , structural and magnetic properties of single layer ( coo@xmath0)@xmath3 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the @xmath69-point set is generated by the monkhorst - pack scheme@xcite with a density of 12@xmath7012@xmath702 .",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoff is set at 250 ry to ensure the convergence of the calculations .",
    "such a high plane - wave energy cutoff is necessary for systems containing very localized @xmath2 electrons using norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "since there has been no theoretical and/or experimental determination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for co @xmath2 electrons in na@xmath7coo@xmath0 , we adopt a moderate @xmath71 ev and a @xmath72 ev in our calculations and neglect their doping dependence .",
    "the exchange parameter @xmath37 is of the order of 1 ev for most later transition metal oxides@xcite and singh has given an estimate of @xmath73 ev for na@xmath7coo@xmath0@xcite .",
    "similar values of @xmath36 ( 5.4 and 5.0 ev ) have been used in previous studies on this system@xcite . in general ,",
    "lsda+u results are insensitive to small variation of these parameters .",
    "we first study the undoped parents material coo@xmath0 in its ferromagnetic phase .",
    "single layer coo@xmath0 has a @xmath75 point group symmetry , which derives from the cubic ( @xmath76 ) symmetry after a distortion along the [ 111 ] direction .",
    "the co @xmath77 orbitals split into a triplet ( @xmath78 ) and a doublet ( @xmath79 ) under the influence of the octahedral ( cubic ) crystal field . upon further lowering the symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath78 states split into @xmath80 and @xmath81 levels .",
    "the @xmath78 derived @xmath79 states then mix with the original @xmath79 ones , forming two new doublets @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "of course , the degree of this mixing increases with increasing trigonal distortion and co @xmath2 derived @xmath79 states will further hybridize with the o @xmath84 states .",
    "it is generally believed that the relevant low - energy electronic states of coo@xmath0 are predominately of co @xmath2 character and can be interpreted in terms of those of the co ion .",
    "for example , the electronic structure of undoped coo@xmath0 in its low spin state ( @xmath85 ) may be understood in terms of co@xmath86(@xmath87 ) .",
    "thus upon electron doping , it becomes a doped spin-@xmath88 system .",
    "however , due to the strong mixing between o @xmath84 and co @xmath2 states in these systems , the validity of such a simplified picture needs to be carefully examined .",
    "figure [ coo2_dos ] compares the lsda and lsda+u density of states ( dos ) of coo@xmath0 .",
    "the undoped parent material coo@xmath0 is a mott - hubbard insulator ( or charge transfer insulator according to the zas classification@xcite ) as predicted by lsda+u .",
    "in contrast , our lsda calculation gives a metallic ground state with a rather high dos ( 2.5 electrons / ev / cell ) at the fermi level , which is consistent with the lsda result of singh@xcite .",
    "the local spin moment of co calculated within lsda+u is about 1 @xmath89 , as expected for a spin-@xmath88 system .",
    "lsda , on the other hand , gives a local moment of 0.58 @xmath89 due to lack of orbital polarizations .",
    "the octahedral crystal field splitting ( @xmath8 3.0 ev ) of co @xmath2 orbitals , i.e. , the splitting between the occupied @xmath78 and the unoccupied @xmath80 states of the @xmath2-orbitals , can easily be estimated from the lsda results .",
    "further splitting of the @xmath78 states ( the separation between the two peaks within the triplet labelled @xmath90 in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ coo2_dos ] ) due to the trigonal distortion is about 1.0 ev within lsda . determining these values from lsda+u results , however ,",
    "is more involved since additional splitting due to the coulomb @xmath36 can not be easily decoupled .",
    "the explicit removal of the self - interaction in the screened hf interaction term in the lsda+u method separates the occupied and the unoccupied @xmath2 states and pushes the occupied ones below the o @xmath84 levels .",
    "consequently , the top of the valene band has predominately o @xmath84 character within lsda+u , contrary to the co @xmath2 character in lsda .",
    "another interesting observation is that the hybridization between the occupied co @xmath2 and o @xmath84 states is enhanced within the lsda+u method .",
    "whereas the dos calculated with lsda clearly shows @xmath84-dominate @xmath78 and @xmath80 states ( labelled @xmath78(@xmath91 and @xmath80(@xmath92 ) in fig .",
    "[ coo2_dos ] ) and @xmath2-dominate @xmath78 states ( labelled @xmath78(@xmath93 ) ) , this separation between @xmath2 and @xmath84 states becomes less obvious in lsda+u results .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that both co @xmath2 and o @xmath84 states need to be considered when one attempts to derive an effective low energy model hamiltonian for this system .    to better understand the electronic structure of coo@xmath0 , we further project the wavefunctions onto the symmetry - adapted co @xmath2 orbitals ( i.e. , the eigenfunctions of the density matrix defined in eq .",
    "( [ density_matrix ] ) ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ coo2_dos2 ] .",
    "the corresponding orbital occupations are given in table [ occup_coo2 ] .",
    "as we have mentioend above , the @xmath78 triplet splits into @xmath80 and @xmath81 under the influence of triangular crystal field .",
    "although this splitting ( @xmath8 1.0 ev ) is insignificant in lsda , the strong on - site coulomb interaction included in the lsda+u pushes the minority spin @xmath81 up so that it becomes completely unoccupied .",
    "the separation between the occupied and the unoccupied @xmath81 states is @xmath94 ev , as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ coo2_dos2 ] .",
    "the @xmath78 derived @xmath80 doublet , labelled @xmath95 , is nearly fully occupied as expected ( see table [ occup_coo2 ] ) . for the other doublet ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath96 , one would expect it to be unoccupied from the simple molecular orbital analysis .",
    "however , this does not seem to be the case in our calculations due to strong mixing between co @xmath2 and o @xmath84 states with compatible symmetry .",
    "we call these hybridized doublet @xmath97 . both the occupied and the unoccupied @xmath97 have nearly equal o @xmath84 and co @xmath2 characters . as a result ,",
    "the valency of the co ion in coo@xmath0 deviates substantially from its norminal value 4 + .",
    "this indicates a coexistence of ionic and covalent bondings in this system : whereas the co @xmath98 electrons are fully ionized , the @xmath2 electrons are better described as covalently bonded with o @xmath84 electrons due to the significant overlap between the two wavefunctions .",

    "the number of @xmath2 electrons is the occupation times two . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "so far we have assumed a low spin state for co ions and the doped electrons always go to the minority spin @xmath81 conduction band .",
    "thus the local spin moment on co decreases with increasing doping level and vanishes at @xmath99 .",
    "however , this does not seem to be consistent with the observations that sizable effective magnetic moments @xmath100 exist at doping level @xmath66 .",
    "for example , magnetic susceptibility measurements of na@xmath9coo@xmath0 give a @xmath100 of 2.74 @xmath89/co assuming only co@xmath86 ions contribute to the curie constant @xmath101@xcite .",
    "this is much larger than the  spin - only \" value ( @xmath102 ) of co@xmath86 ion in its low spin state .",
    "if , on the other hand , all co sites are assumed equivalent , the results yield a @xmath100 of 1.37 @xmath89/co@xcite , which is again not compatible with the calculated spin moment .",
    "this apparent discrepancy raises the possibilities of unquenched orbital moments and/or other spin configurations of co ions in this system , especially for high doping levels ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the spin states of co ions in coo@xmath0 are determined by several competing factors such as the crystal field splitting , hund s rule coupling and the screened on - site coulomb interactions .",
    "therefore , depending on the relative strength of these factors , some co ions might adopt an intermediate - spin state . here",
    "we explore such a possibility .    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ coo2_dos ] , the energy of the unoccupied majority spin @xmath79 is only slightly higher than that of minority spin @xmath81 in the undoped single layer coo@xmath0 . in the real system , especially in unhydrated",
    "na@xmath7coo@xmath0 , however , the situation might be more complicated .",
    "the presence of a possibly ordered na potential might enhance or induce charge orderings in the coo@xmath0 layer@xcite and the energy level of the two unoccupied states , @xmath79 and @xmath81 , might get reversed on some co sites . a smaller crystal field splitting or larger",
    "@xmath36 could pull down the @xmath79 state or push up the @xmath81 one .",
    "the doped electron could then go to the @xmath79 majority spin state , resulting in an intermediate - spin state for the corresponding co ions .",
    "therefore , we propose the following scenario for unhydrated na@xmath7coo@xmath0 system : at low doping level , all co ions are in their low spin states . as doping level increases , na ions tend to order themselves to minimize the coulomb energy .",
    "( we will discussed na orderings in more detail in the following . )",
    "this ordering might then enhance or induce charge ordering in coo@xmath0 layers .",
    "due to charge ordering in the coo@xmath0 layer , co ions then have a different symmetry and chemical environment , leading to different crystal field splitting and/or on - site interactions . under certain circumstance",
    ", the unoccupied majority spin @xmath79 state might be lower in energy than the @xmath81 state .",
    "the local moment of these co ions will then increase with increasing doping .",
    "we have calculated a ferromagnetic system with co ions in their intermediate spin states for doping level @xmath104 and found that the local spin moment is 1.52 @xmath89/co .",
    "not surprisingly , the energy of the intermediate spin state is higher than that of the low - spin state ( by @xmath8 0.5 ev / co ) .",
    "however , charge orderings might reduce or inverse this energy difference , resulting in an intermediate - spin ground state .",
    "it is also plausible that this kind of rich degeneracy of spin states , a result of nearly perfect balance between the crystal field and hund s rules effects , is responsible for the unusually high thermopower in this system .",
    "it is usually assumed that the na layer is disordered in na@xmath7coo@xmath0 and the primary effect of na is to provide electrons to the coo@xmath0 layer . in strongly correlated systems , however , charge and/or spin orderings usually happen at an extremely low energy scale and seemingly insignificant interactions can sometimes result in profound changes in the electronic structure .",
    "although we have shown that the na potential has minimal effects on the calculated electronic structure of ferromagnetically ordered coo@xmath0 , it is still unclear the exact role na plays in determining the properties of the system , especially at high doping when the na layer is likely ordered . whether or not na becomes ordered depends on a competition between entropic and energetic factors .",
    "if energetics dominate , an ordering might occur .",
    "in fact , there has been increasing experimental evidence that the na layer might be ordered at some doping levels .",

    "et al . _  reported a @xmath107 superstructure in na@xmath7coo@xmath0 for @xmath108 and ascribed it to a possible na ordering@xcite .",
    "since na are fully ionized , it might be possible to discuss their ordering by simple electrostatic and entropic arguments .",
    "( chemical interactions between na and coo@xmath0 layers might also play a minor role but more difficult to characterize . ) at low na concentrations , entropic effects should dominate and the na layer is likely disordered . as doping level increases , however , na ions will tend to organize themselves ( at least partially and locally ) to minize the ionic repulsion , since it costs energy to place two na ions in neighboring @xmath109 and @xmath110 sites ( see fig .  [ na_ordering ] ) .",
    "this does not necessarily lead to a long - range ordering since there could be many ( nearly ) degenerate local orderings .",
    "however , if there exist an ordered pattern which has significantly lower energy ( compared to the thermal energy ) than others , a long range ordering might result .",
    "for @xmath104 , we indeed find a particular arrangement of na ions which is compatible with the observed @xmath105 ordering@xcite and has as much as 0.3 ev / na lower coulomb energy than other configurations with similar unit cells ( see fig .  [ na_ordering ] ) if only in - plane coulomb interactions are taken into account .",
    "it might be possible that the interplay between the ordering in the na layer and the charge ordering in the coo@xmath0 layer is responsible for the observed insulating behavior in na@xmath106coo@xmath0 , as discussed by foo _",
    "el al_@xcite .",

    "[ na_ordering ] , with filled black circles denoting occupied and gray circles partially occupied ( 50% for @xmath111 ) na sites .",
    "interestingly , this pattern of low energy ordering is also consistent with the reported na superstructure for @xmath108@xcite .",
    "the low energy ordering pattern for @xmath104 is rather exclusive in the sense that further addition of na to this structure will result in occupation of neighboring @xmath109 and @xmath110 sites thus increase the coulomb energy sharply .    in general",
    ", we find it very energetically unfavorable to occupy neighboring @xmath109 and @xmath110 sites . at high doping ( e.g. , @xmath112 0.75 ) ,",
    "na ions tend to occupy only one of the two distinct sites within a given domain .",
    "the size of these domains presumably increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "if interactions between na and coo@xmath0 layers are taken into account , the two na sites may not be equilvalent energetically .",
    "in fact , our calculations indicate that the @xmath110 site has about 0.1 ev / na lower in energy .",
    "this is due to the different coulomb repulsion between the na and co in the two configurations .",
    "therefore , @xmath110 sites are more likely to be occupied , provided that no immediate neighboring @xmath109 sites are already occupied .",
    "although this differentiation between the two sites should be taken into account when discussing na orderings , no changes to our conclusion for a na ordering of @xmath104 is expected due to the large in - plane ordering energy .",
    "magnetic and/or charge orderings in na@xmath7coo@xmath0 are other subjects of great interest",

    "very weak magnetic ordering has been observed at @xmath116 22 k only for doping @xmath117 .",
    "curiously enough , the measured magnetizations differ by two order of magnitute between two experiments@xcite .",
    "we try to explore the simplest afm ordering with a @xmath107 unit cell in this system .",
    "the afm phase is found to be slightly lower in energy ( @xmath8 10 mev / co ) than the fm phase for doping level @xmath118 . however , this small difference could be beyond the accuracy of our theoretical treatment .",

    "although the low energy valence states are not significantly affected , the bandwidth of the partially occupied @xmath81 state is greatly reduced as a result of afm ordering .",
    "this raises the possibility of further supression of the @xmath81 bandwidth if more complicated orderings are present , which might help to account for the mysterious electron mass enhancement@xcite in this system .",

    "although the pairing mechanism that leads to superconditivity in this system remains a subject of intensive investigation , high dos at the fermi level at low doping levels , together with strong electron - phonon couplings , might be partially responsible for the superconducting transition in the hydrated systems .",
    "the role water molecules play in the superconducting transition is still unknown .",
    "one possibility is that the screening effects , which greatly supress the interaction between na and coo@xmath0 layers and possible charge orderings in the coo@xmath0 layer , lead to a more homogeneous electronic system in the coo@xmath0 layer and ultimately favor a superconducting state over competing phases .",
    "a better understanding of the properties of this material requires more experimental work and thorough theoretical investigations .",
    "the interplay between the na ordering and the charge / magnetic ordering in the coo@xmath0 layer deserves particular attention , especially in the unhydrated system .",
