    "quantum entanglement and holography are two fundamental concepts in current theoretical physics .",
    "the entropy of the entanglement has information similar to the two - point correlation function of scaling operators , and is recognized to be a new order parameter efficient for detecting quantum - ordered states . on the other side , the holography provides us a method of how to transform the quantum entanglement into classical quantities .",
    "a representative holographic connection is the so - called ryu - takayanagi formula in the string theory that transforms the entanglement entropy into the minimal surface area on the classical side with negative curvature  @xcite .",
    "the negative curvature space is characterized by the presence of various length scales , and in other words the holography seems to be a method of how to efficiently embed the quantum data into the classical memory space .",
    "although the holography has been mainly examined in string - theory community , one of the authors ( hm ) has also proposed a possible alternative holographic theory appearing in the statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the theory is based on the image processing of spin snapshot data in the classical two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising and three - states potts models .",
    "the image processing is done by the singular value decomposition ( svd ) , and because of the universal nature of the singular values , the information entropy defined from the singular values shows a universal feature that reminds us with the entanglement entropy in 1d quantum critical systems .",
    "we call this entropy as snapshot entropy . in the previous paper",
    ", this correspondence was considered to originate from the suzuki - trotter decomposition of the corresponding 1d transverse - field quantum ising model  @xcite .",
    "svd can also be applied to both of classical and quantum systems , and the function of svd as length - scale decomposition works in both systems .",
    "thus , we think that this common feature can detects the quantum - classical correspondence .    however , there are still many questions for the physical meaning of the snapshot entropy , although related works appear recently  @xcite .",
    "one of mysteries is why the snapshot entropy at @xmath1 behaves as @xmath4 .",
    "according to the conformal field theory ( cft ) , the entanglement entropy in 1d critical systems is obtained as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the central charge of corresponding cft and @xmath7 is a non - universal positive constant  @xcite . if the snapshot entropy is a key quantity of holography , we expect that the amount of information should conserve after the quantum - classical correspondence , and thus the coefficient @xmath8 should appear .    a hint to resolve this problem appears in the author s recent work on the snapshot entropy of fractal images  @xcite .",
    "fractal images are ideal ising snapshots at @xmath1 owing to their self - similarities . here",
    ", a fractal is defined by the tensor product of the @xmath9 unit cell matrix @xmath10 .",
    "then , the tensor product of @xmath11 copies of @xmath10 , @xmath12 , represents the fractal with @xmath11 different length scales .",
    "an important point is that the unit cell matrix @xmath10 should be factorized so that the tensor product properly creates the desired fractal image .",
    "then , the entropy is given by @xmath13 for the total system size @xmath14 , and we know that the snapshot entropy counts the number of the different cluster sizes .",
    "therefore , the factorization is quite important for the scaling formula .",
    "for example , let us consider the unit cell matrix of the sierpinski carpet given by @xmath15 the tensor product of two copies of @xmath10 is given by @xmath16 and clearly the level-@xmath17 fractal structure emerges .",
    "however , we can not exchange @xmath18 and @xmath19 , since the matrix elements @xmath20 are all zero except for the central pixel . in this viewpoint",
    ", the previous works did not take care about the factorization .",
    "therein , the up and down spins of the ising model were taken to be @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we need to reconsider whether this selection really produces the factorized form or not .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to confirm the role of the factorization on the snapshot entropy near @xmath1 .",
    "then , the factorization will make it clear to know the close connection among the central charge , hierarchical cluster spins , and the entropy formula .",
    "we will actually find that the factorization is crucial to the proper scaling relation of the snapshot entropy at @xmath1 .",
    "the proper selection of the matrix elements would be @xmath18 and @xmath19 for up and down spins of the ising model .",
    "the selection for the potts model would be @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath17 .",
    "then , the entanglement entropy formula given by eq .",
    "( [ cft ] ) is actually reproduced up to the coefficient @xmath8 by the calculation of the snapshot entropy .",
    "we will also mention the largest eigenvalue spectrum , and this also shows similar scaling behavior .",
    "we will point out that the largest singular value should be properly regulated by the factorization .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the role of factorization on the svd spectrum . in sec .",
    "iii , the numerical data and the scaling analysis for the 2d ising model are presented , and we will give a theoretical interpretation of the scaling based on cft and the suzuki - trotter decompostion . in sec .",
    "iv , we examine close connection between the tensor product of the factorized snapshot matrix and the cluster distribution .",
    "we also present the finite-@xmath23 scaling in sec .  v. the reliability of our scaling",
    "is examined in sec .",
    "vi by taking the three - states potts model with the different central charge .",
    "vii is devoted to the summary part .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ising model is defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the sum runs over the nearest neighbor lattice sites @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the exchange interaction .",
    "we consider the square lattice under the periodic boundary condition , and the system size is taken to be @xmath0 .",
    "the critical temperature is known to be @xmath28 .",
    "the central charge of cft is @xmath29 .",
    "we regard a snapshot ( a spin configuration ) as the following matrix @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the index @xmath32 means non-factorization . to obtain the snapshot ,",
    "we perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulation by the metropolis algorithm . starting with the temperature @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , we gradually reduce ( increase ) @xmath35 by @xmath36 , and take @xmath37 mc steps for convergence at each @xmath35 . here",
    ", one mc step counts @xmath0 local updates . at each @xmath35",
    ", we calculate the snapshot entropy with the help of svd .",
    "we also take the swendsen - wang algorithm for more sophisticated scaling analysis ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , and  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "then , we take @xmath38 , and @xmath39 mc steps . here",
    ", one mc step corresponds to all possible cluster flips for a given spin configuration .",
    "the factorization of eq .",
    "( [ non ] ) is defined by @xmath40 in the ferromagnetic phase , we need to take care about many zeros of matrix elements , since in such a case , svd and entropy calculation become unstable .",
    "if the total magnetization @xmath41 is positive , we replace @xmath42 into @xmath18 . if the magnetization is nagative , we take @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case of eq .",
    "( [ shift ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the snapshot data @xmath45 can be regarded as a matrix . to extract the universal information of the matrix data , we apply svd to @xmath45 .",
    "the svd is defined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the @xmath32th singular value , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are @xmath32th column unitary matrices .",
    "the square of the sigular value , @xmath50 , is equal to the eigenvalue of the density matrix defined by @xmath51 we align the eigenvalues so that @xmath52 .",
    "each eigenvalue @xmath50 is normalized to be @xmath53 then , the snapshot entropy is defined by @xmath54 in the following , we examine the @xmath35 and @xmath55 dependences of this entropy @xmath56 .    before going into details of numerical data ,",
    "we mention the density matrices for both factorized and non - factorized snapshot data , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "these data are related with @xmath59 where the @xmath0 background matrix @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 then the density matrix for @xmath57 is given by @xmath62 where we have used @xmath63 .",
    "the second term , @xmath64 , is very small for paramagnetic states and near @xmath1 , since @xmath58 contains both of @xmath65 components and the matrix product almost cancels out .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues of @xmath66 are quite different from those of @xmath67 as long as the background matrix @xmath60 is not the unit matrix .",
    "this means that the factorization is characterized by @xmath60 and in the present case , @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) affects the final result very much .",
    "according to the recent paper  @xcite , the non - factorized density matrix @xmath67 corresponds to the spin - spin correlator @xmath68 with the anomalous dimension @xmath69 , and is diagonalized by the fourier transformation .",
    "the background matrix @xmath60 is also diagonalized by the fourier transformation , and the third term in eq .",
    "( [ rhof ] ) contributes to the uniform ( @xmath70 ) component . thus if the second term in eq .",
    "( [ rhof ] ) , @xmath71 , does not affect so much for the final result , the factorization makes the maximum eigenvalue increased .",
    "after the normalization of a set of all the eigenvalues , the snapshot entropy decreases , since the probability of only the largest singular - value state increases . as we have already mentioned in the introduction , the entropy without the factorization is given by @xmath4 .",
    "thus , it is natural that a factor less than unity appears in front of the logarithmic term .",
    "the above statement only guarantees the presence of the small factor , and we do not mention anymore about its physical origin .",
    "however , it is found in the entropy calculation by svd that the mangitude of the largest eivenvalue @xmath72 is crucial for determining the total entropy value including the central charge .",
    "this point has been already clarified on the quantum side  @xcite . according to cft , the logarithm of the largest eigenvalue is a half of the total entanglement entropy @xmath73 and the central charge appears through the scaling formula of @xmath56 .",
    "we hypothesize that this property is also reflected to the classical side .",
    "if @xmath72 is the uniform component of the fourier - transformed correlator @xmath74 , @xmath75 is almost equal to the definition of the entanglement entropy in terms of calabrese - cardy s approach  @xcite .",
    "maybe the factorization facilitates to pick up the uniform component , although in the present state a role of additional constant factor by the factorization on @xmath72 is still missing .",
    "we will examine whether this scaling equation is also satisfied on the classical side as well as the entanglement entropy formula .",
    "let us further refer to the representation dependence on the svd spectra .",
    "we focus on whether a particular choice of representation can detect fine structures of the spin congifuration .",
    "then , we would like to confirm that the background matrix is necessary for the representation .",
    "if this is correct , the background matrix leads to the important result that the choice is related to a proper regulation of the largest eigenvalue . for these purposes ,",
    "we consider the following examples ( @xmath76 ) @xmath77 here , we regard an alignment of @xmath19 ( or @xmath78 ) as a spin string , and in the case of @xmath79 the strings of @xmath19 and @xmath78 are classically entangled .",
    "at first let us take @xmath80 .",
    "then , their partial density matrices are given by @xmath81 thus , the matrix @xmath82 has larger entropy than that for the matrix @xmath83 .",
    "this means that the complexity of string configuration affects the entropy value",
    ". however , if we replace @xmath18 to @xmath22 , the situation changes .",
    "actually , @xmath84 and then we can not identify the essential difference between @xmath85 and @xmath86 by the snapshot entropy that is only dependent to the eigenvalues of this matrix . we think that the excess entropy induced by a larger - entropy representation is an artifact , and we should determine the minimum - entropy state . in this strategy ,",
    "negative components are not willing , since the effect of the negative sign on the partial density matrix sometimes vanishes .",
    "the uniform shift of the matrix elements , like the backgroud matrix @xmath60 in the previous subsection , is an efficient way of taking account of the above strategy .",
    "we introduce the shifted matrix for @xmath87 as @xmath88 then , the partial density matrix is given by @xmath89 and we should take @xmath90 for the minimum entropy state .",

    "however , in sec.vi , we will examine the snapshot entropy of the three - states potts model , where we can not find the corresponding quantum 1d system .",
    "then , we necessarily use the central charge of the potts model @xmath185 by considering that the criticality should be conserved after the quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "this problem may be similar to that in the string theory .",
    "therein , the charge can be defined on the classical side , and is called as the brown - henneaux central charge  @xcite , in which the charge is replaced by the curvature radius devided by the newton constant on the classical side . although our scaling formula comes from the quantum side , we think that it would be enough to take account of the central charge on the classical side .",
    "we will again mention this point in sec .",
    "let us consider the appearance of the central charge @xmath6 in more physical standpoint .",
    "we examine that the factorization changes the distribution of the number of the ferromagnetic cluster sizes in the snapshot .",
    "this is crucial for determining the proper spin - spin correlator form . to see this",
    ", we introduce an effective model defined by the following unit cell matrix @xmath186 where the left half block ( @xmath187 spins ) represents a large spin cluster , while the right upper site reprensets a small cluster ( @xmath19 spin ) .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the fractal - like spin configuration can be made by the multiple tensor product of the unit cell @xmath10 .",
    "taking the tensor product between two copies of @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath188 to clearly look at cluster destribution , we omit zero components from @xmath189 ( it is also possible to omit @xmath19 ) .",
    "then result is following : @xmath190 then , we find certain distribution of various - size clusters . here",
    ", we define a set of up spins ( labeled by @xmath19 ) connected along bond direction as a cluster .",
    "the largest cluster size is @xmath191 .",
    "we observe a rough tendency that the number of the clusters increases with decreasing the cluster size .",
    "this tendency matches with the spin configuration realized by the mc simulation at @xmath1 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the non - factorized case , the situation changes .",
    "let us next consider the unit cel matrix @xmath192 and calculate the tensor product .",
    "then we obtain @xmath193 where we have omitted @xmath22 .",
    "we clearly see that there are many large spin clusters and the distribution changes .",
    "let us discuss a close relation between the cluster distribution and the coefficient of the logarithmic term in the snapshot entropy formula . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the snapshot entropy is given by @xmath194 where @xmath195 ( we denote this as @xmath196 ) , and @xmath197 are the normalized eigenvalues of @xmath198 . this equation tells us that there exist unit cell matrices with a particular set of @xmath197 values that leads to a proper central charge .",
    "we compare the @xmath199 value for eq .",
    "( [ m01 ] ) with that for eq .",
    "( [ mpm ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath200 for eq .",
    "( [ m01 ] ) , and @xmath201 for eq .",
    "( [ mpm ] ) .",
    "now the system after @xmath11 tensor products is a rectangular shape @xmath202 , and thus we identify a typical linear size to be @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath205 for eq .",
    "( [ m01 ] ) and @xmath206 for eq .",
    "( [ mpm ] ) . in comparison with the real central charge @xmath29 , they are much larger",
    ". however , these trends may suggest that a better cluster configuration tends to provides us with a @xmath199 value close to the real @xmath6 value .",
    "let us go back to eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) .",
    "we told that the sierpinski carpet seems to be the ideal representation of the fractal - like spin configuration at @xmath1 of the ising model , in which white pixels are regarded as spin islands .",
    "actually , this case provides us with @xmath207 and @xmath208 which is much better than @xmath205 and @xmath209 .",
    "alternatively , we can set up a unit cell matrix that represents a slightly - ordered but still critically fructuating spin configuration .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath210 the matrix @xmath211 has two non - zero eigenvalues @xmath212 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath213 and we obtain @xmath214 smaller than @xmath29 . we think that the density of zero components providing the best configuration is between the density of zeros in eq .",
    "( [ m01 ] ) and that in eq .",
    "( [ m01new ] ) .",
    "up to now we have confirmed that the factorization changes the entropy scaling very much .",
    "thus , we are also interested in whether the coarse - grained snapshot entropy formula is also deformed or not .",
    "the coarse - grained entropy is defined by @xmath215 it has been pointed out recently that the coarse - grained entropy obeys anomalous scaling that is somewhat different from the finite - entanglement scaling in quantum 1d systems near criticality , because the snapshot density matrix roughly corresponds to the two - point spin correlation function rather than a state itself  @xcite . in this viewpoint ,",
    "holographic transformation only appears on the full snapshot entropy .",
    "the finite - entanglement scaling  @xcite is given by @xmath216 and the recently proposed scaling is given by @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the anomalous dimension , and in the ising case we have @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "this scaling is derived from algebraic decay of the singular value spectrum as @xmath219 where @xmath220 is a constant fitting parameter  @xcite .     for @xmath150 at @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines denote eq .",
    "( [ imura ] ) with @xmath227 and @xmath228 and eq .",
    "( [ pollmann ] ) , respectively .",
    "the inset represents the snapshot spectrum at @xmath229 .",
    "a guide line denotes @xmath230 with @xmath231.,width=264 ]    figure  [ fig6 ] shows @xmath232 for @xmath150 near @xmath1 .",
    "we have averaged @xmath232 over @xmath233 samples , and denote the results as @xmath234 we find that the numerical data fit with eq .",
    "( [ imura ] ) for wide-@xmath23 range .",
    "we also show the snapshot spectrum in the inset of fig .",
    "the result is consistent with the recent works  @xcite .",
    "these results show that the anomalous scaling with @xmath218 is robust against the factorization . as we have mentioned in sec.ii , only the largest eigenvalue @xmath72 increases by the factorization .",
    "thus if we forget the normalization , the finite-@xmath23 dependence is not affected .",
    "actually , the inset clearly shows the presence of the algebraic decay of @xmath235 ( @xmath236 ) that is the origin of the anomalous scaling eq .",
    "( [ imura ] ) , and then @xmath72 largely deviates from this scaling .",
    "finally , we discuss about the snapshot entropy for the three - states potts model . the hamiltonian is given by @xmath237 where @xmath238 is usually taken to be @xmath22 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . the central charge of the model is @xmath185 , and thus our holographic conjecture can be well supported by wider universality classes .",
    "a proper description of @xmath57 may be given by @xmath239 and @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) is used here .",
    "we obtain snapshots by the mc simulation , and apply svd to the snapshots to calculate the entropy .     with use of the factorized form",
    "@xmath240 as a function of @xmath35 for the three - states potts model : @xmath92 ( purple ) and @xmath94 ( blue ) .",
    "two lines with the same color represent different runs .",
    "a dashed line is a guide to @xmath1.,width=264 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we plot @xmath109 for @xmath241 and @xmath138 as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "we observe the intersection at around @xmath242 .",
    "the result suggests that the scaling formula given by eq .",
    "( [ sav ] ) is also satisfied for @xmath185 , but it is interesting that @xmath78 is now negative .",
    "the result also suggests that the central charge in the scaling formula can be defined by the central charge on the classical side , although in the potts model case there is no information about the corresponding 1d quantum system . here , we did not consider the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath103",
    "this is because the transition is quite sharp even for relatively small sizes of order @xmath138 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ peak ] ) , we think that @xmath243 must be quite small , because @xmath244 for the three - states potts model and there is the @xmath55-dependence on @xmath103 . by combining @xmath245 with @xmath146 together , we imagine that the corresponding 1d system might be the topological ground state of a quantum model with @xmath185 .",
    "the confirmation of this conjecture is an interesting future work .",
    "in summary , we have examined the role of the factorized snapshot matrix on the entropy scaling in the 2d classical ising model .",
    "the result is quite surprizing and seems to contain enough information of the holographically connecting 1d quantum system , including finite - temperature efffects , although we just replace @xmath22 into @xmath18 in the snapshot data .",
    "this result has been also confirmed for different universality classes by calculating the snapshot entropy of the three - states potts model .",
    "the point behind this factorization is how to correctly treat the largest singular value of the snapshot matrix .",
    "this point has been also confirmed numerically by calculating the largest singular spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the cluster sizes in the snapshot matrix is related to the coefficient of the logarithmic scaling formula .",
    "this means that the coefficient of the logarithmic term is actually related to the critical properties of the system .",
    "this critical property agrees well with the entanglement entropy formula in 1d critical systems .",
    "the snapshot may seem to be different from physical quantities .",
    "however , it is almost obvious that the average entropy should have enough information of the partition function .",
    "the present result shows that the entropy detects the total amount of information of the system , not the quality of the snapshot , and thus the holographic connection between completely different systems naturally emerges from the present entropic calculations .",
