    "@xcite on bosons confined in an optical lattice demonstrated the transition between a mott phase and a superfluid phase ( sf ) , as was first predicted by jaksch _",
    "et al . _",
    "the experiments are adequately described by a single band bose - hubbard hamiltonian with on - site repulsion only .",
    "this type of repulsion leads to two different phases .",
    "a mott insulating phase can exist at commensurate fillings , with a quantum phase transition to a superfluid as the density is shifted or the interaction strength weakened . in the experiments however , the quadratic confining potential adds a new term to the hamiltonian that cuts off any long range correlations , but mott and superfluid regions can still occur .",
    "the experiments led to a complete revival of interest in the bosonic model , thanks to the unprecedented control over the physical parameters compared to former realizations .",
    "other experimental realizations of bosonic lattice systems include @xmath0he on graphite  @xcite , superconducting islands or grains connected by josephson junctions  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "cooper paired fermions are considered as bosons , at least approximately .",
    "recently , attempts have been made to investigate at what scales the fermionic nature of paired fermions can play a role  @xcite , and the result is that for the energy scales considered here , individual atoms can safely be described by a one - boson operator @xmath1 , as expected .    since the work by fisher _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the determination of the ground state phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model with on - site repulsion only has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "analytic studies using mean - field theory  @xcite and renormalization group techniques  @xcite led to a deeper physical understanding of the model .",
    "strong coupling expansions  @xcite gave a better quantitative picture , while quantum monte - carlo simulations  @xcite were carried out in one and two dimensions .",
    "the one - dimensional case was recently investigated using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , yielding the most accurate results at present .",
    "longer range interactions can cause charge density wave , stripe or even supersolid order  @xcite .",
    "disorder and impurities can have dramatic effects  @xcite and lead to even other phases .",
    "the model with a quadratic confining potential  @xcite has been addressed in one dimension  @xcite and for a small lattice in three dimensions  @xcite , using quantum monte - carlo methods .    in view of the enormous success of dmrg",
    "@xcite in bosonic  @xcite and fermionic  @xcite real - space lattice models in one dimension , dmrg has been extended beyond these models , towards applications in metallic grains  @xcite , quantum chemistry  @xcite and first attempts have even been undertaken towards applications in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , an exact dmrg study in all 3 dimensions of the bose - hubbard model is not feasible with current computer power .",
    "dmrg was a substantial improvement  @xcite on the older numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , which had only a poor reputation in dealing with long - range interactions between fermions  @xcite , but we found it useful for bosonic systems ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the basic philosophy of this work consists of extending one - site mean - field theory to larger blocks , following the idea of the renormalization group method .",
    "a fully variational method is obtained which incorporates correlations beyond mean - field at low computational cost and which is able , unlike nrg , to accurately describe the different phases of the mott - sf transition .",
    "we judged the computational cost as primordial , so that extensions to large lattices are in reach and so that a direct simulation of the experimental parameters can be accomplished , while the computational uncertainties remain well within the experimental uncertainty range .",
    "a disadvantage of the method is the breaking of number conservation during the intermediate steps of the renormalization procedure . in the final step particle number",
    "should be restored in principle , but this restoration is only partial when an insufficient amount of states are kept during the model space truncation . the quantity that directly relates to experiment is the momentum distribution .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the appearance of satellite peaks in the momentum distribution signals the appearance of a mott region in the center of the trap . we will especially focus on the momentum distribution and on the issue of the satellite peaks .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : expla ] we explain the method , in sec .  [ sec : comp ] compare it to exact diagonalization methods for small latices and in sec .",
    "[ sec : resu ] we present results in 1 , 2 and 3 dimensions .",
    "we end with the conclusion and the acknowledgments .",
    "bosons in an optical lattice realize a bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite and more specifically , we consider here the soft - core bose - hubbard hamiltonian in the grand - canonical ensemble in @xmath2 dimensions and subject to a confining field , @xmath3 the sum @xmath4 is over the nearest neighbors only .",
    "the operator @xmath5 creates a boson on lattice site @xmath6 while @xmath7 removes it .",
    "the operator @xmath8 counts the local density on site @xmath6 .",
    "the operator @xmath9 denotes the total number operator , @xmath10 .",
    "we take the distance @xmath11 between adjacent sites equal to @xmath12 .",
    "the confining field acts as a local site dependent chemical potential @xmath13 that can be added to the chemical potential @xmath14 to form @xmath15 . in case of a site dependent @xmath16 we speak of the inhomogeneous or confined model , in case of a uniform @xmath14",
    "we speak of the unconfined or homogeneous model .",
    "we also define the coordination number @xmath17 as the number of neighbors of each site and consider a linear , square or cubic lattice of length @xmath18 along each axis .",
    "the energy scale is set by setting @xmath19 .",
    "this hamiltonian is the easiest bosonic model in which two different effects compete : the kinetic energy is diagonal in momentum space and tries to delocalize the particles over the sites , while the potential energy is diagonal in coordinate space and localizes the particles .",
    "we first discuss the physics of the model in absence of disorder in one dimension  @xcite . when the potential energy dominates , the system forms a mott insulating phase at integer densities , that remain pinned at these integer values and the phase is incompressible .",
    "the mott lobes are surrounded by compressible sf phases , where the densities fluctuate .",
    "this is visualised in the mean - field phase diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : phasemf ] , which can easily be calculated  @xcite .",
    "note that this phase diagram is approximate , in the true phase diagram the @xmath20 lobe e.g. extends to smaller values of @xmath21 and the lobe closes in a point - like fashion .",
    "there are two different phase transitions possible . when keeping the density constant at an integer value , phase fluctuations dominate and the transition is of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type .",
    "this transition can only occur at the tip of the insulator lobe , that as a consequence closes in the point - like fashion .",
    "the generic phase transition is driven by density fluctuations and belongs to a different universality class . for a general @xmath2 dimension , the bkt transition generalizes to the @xmath22 dimensional xy universality class .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram in the units we adopt throughout the paper .",
    "the mott lobes are indicated and surrounded by a superfluid.,height=226 ]    a first approximation for the bose - hubbard model is the gutzwiller variational ansatz  @xcite leading to a decoupling of the individual lattice sites and to a mean - field theory ( mf ) .",
    "this assumption can be described by the following substitution : @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to a model where particle number symmetry can be broken , and that can exhibit a superfluid and a mott - insulator behavior .    in order to obtain a higher accuracy , we extend the mf approximation to a a renormalization group procedure by taking more correlations into account .",
    "it works as follows . just as in mf ,",
    "first break down the entire lattice to single sites and solve the problem for each site separately .",
    "the hilbert space is truncated so that only a few basis states are kept on every site . in nrg",
    "this state selection is based on energy solely , meaning that we keep the @xmath25 eigenstates corresponding to the @xmath25 lowest energy eigenvalues .",
    "the two sites are combined now to form a small block . at this stage ,",
    "the mf approximation (  [ eqmf ] ) for the hopping term between the two sites can be canceled by adding a term @xmath26 , after which the hamiltonian for the two sites becomes @xmath27 here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the hamiltonians of the left and right site , respectively , and the sum runs over adjacent sites that each belong to a different block . in this first step ,",
    "just the two sites @xmath30 and @xmath31 are meant .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath32 is diagonalized in the space spanned by the product states , that are constructed from the individual basis states of each site .",
    "after diagonalization , only a few states are kept again .",
    "physical observables require now a rotation , since we have performed a basis rotation .",
    "the procedure repeats itself : the small blocks can be joined to form larger blocks which will themselves be the building blocks of still larger blocks etc .",
    "this procedure is very similar to dmrg  @xcite .",
    "the main differences are that in dmrg the selection of the states is based on the eigenvalues of the density matrix instead of on the lowest energy values , and secondly that in nrg one combines blocks ( exploiting symmetry ) , while in dmrg one extends the blocks site by site . in nrg one",
    "performs one calculation till the lattice is entirely built up , while in dmrg one sweeps again through the lattice till convergence is obtained .",
    "dmrg yields results with a higher accuracy , but its computational time and memory cost requirements are beyond current computer power for dimensions higher than one .",
    "a new idea is that we improve on the standard nrg procedure by adding source terms to the hamiltonian on the edges of the blocks .",
    "these terms compensate for the interaction with the other blocks in a mean - field way . in this way",
    ", the hamiltonian of the local block feels already an average contribution of the blocks that have not yet accounted for , and that have a non - local influence on the block under consideration .",
    "after the two joining blocks are taken together , these terms need to be extracted again .",
    "if it were possible to work in an infinite hilbert space the net effect of these source terms would be zero , but in a truncated space the calculation will depend on the values of these terms .",
    "e.g. suppose we are looking for a mott phase and these source terms are set to finite values , then we will not find the mott phase if the source term yields contributions to states higher than the cut - off .",
    "this surely will be the case near the boundary of the mott lobe in a homogeneous system .",
    "we have also tried to apply improved periodic boundary conditions by use of such source terms , contrary to dmrg where one usually adopts open boundary conditions .",
    "( in general , periodic boundary conditions are easier for finite - size scaling . )",
    "we will come back to the issue of source terms in the next section .",
    "some operators , such as the total number operator squared @xmath33 also acquire a contribution from the cross - terms between the two building blocks .",
    "so , more than a simple rotation is needed in this case , and contributions from the total number operator @xmath9 must be taken into account .",
    "schematically , @xmath34 , in which the indices @xmath35 indicate the two joining blocks .    one can obtain the one - body density matrix in coordinate space with the mf+nrg method , but at a low accuracy because correlations @xmath36 are inaccurate when @xmath6 is not the first site of the renormalization procedure , and we need the entire matrix for a confined system .",
    "however , we are able to directly calculate the diagonal of the momentum density operator @xmath37 ( in one dimension ) , @xmath38 here we sum over all sites of the blocks , easing the problem encountered with the one - body density matrix in coordinate space .",
    "this operator can be rewritten as @xmath39 hence we have to keep track of linear combinations of the creation @xmath40 and annihilation @xmath41 operators .",
    "the parts in which both sites @xmath6 and @xmath42 belong to the same block ( left(l ) or right(r ) ) have been omitted , since their updating consists only of a rotation to the newly truncated basis .",
    "when the sites belong to different blocks , there is also a contribution of the cross - term just as with the operator @xmath33 , but it still suffices to update the @xmath43 and @xmath44 operators .",
    "the extension to higher dimensions of eq.([eq : momcossin ] ) is straightforward .",
    "we normalize the fourier transform by adding prefactors @xmath45 so that the trace of the density matrix in momentum space yields the number of particles in the system .",
    "in this section we consider a small lattice in one dimension and in the absence of any kind of disorder .",
    "we have checked the code by comparing the resulting energies to direct lanczos diagonalization values for a lattice containing 8 sites in one dimension . the one dimensional bose - hubbard model with periodic boundaries is a worst - case scenario for our mf+nrg procedure .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : lanc ] .",
    "the parameters in the table vary from a sf phase to a mott phase .",
    "as expected , very deep in a mott phase or in a sf phase we obtain a very good accuracy .",
    "note that the lanczos diagonalization was performed with a fixed boson number , while in the mf+nrg we adjusted the chemical potential in order to fix the density .",
    "the deviations should be interpreted accordingly .",
    ".[table : lanc]comparison of the energies ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) per site obtained by the mf+nrg method for a modest number of states ( 16 and 32 ) kept after each diagonalization with the results @xmath48 of a lanczos diagonalization procedure for a small lattice of 8 sites in 1 dimension .",
    "the deviations ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) are indicated and can be made smaller by keeping more states after each diagonalization .",
    "the mean - field values are in the last column . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have also checked observables like the local density @xmath8 and local compressibility @xmath51 against results obtained with the stochastic series quantum monte - carlo  @xcite ( sse ) method for larger lattices . because the calculation of the momentum distribution seems most critical ,",
    "we have explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momcomp ] the good agreement between the calculation of the momentum distribution with the renormalization group and the sse method for a sf and a mott phase .",
    "the one - body density matrix with the sse method has been obtained by applying the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite to soft - core bosons .",
    "the sse method served as a testing ground for the renormalization method here .",
    "so we have shown that a lot of physics might be examined with our new method .",
    "checking the momentum distribution obtained with mf+nrg to a sse calculation for an unconfined system in one dimension of 32 sites .",
    "calculations have been done for a system in the mott phase ( @xmath52 , dashed line ) and for a system in the sf phase ( @xmath53 , full line ) .",
    "the errors on the sse data points are shown but very small . in the inset ,",
    "the mf+nrg data points are indicated explicitly by small circles , while `` + '' signs with error bars indicate the sse data points.,height=226 ]    the parameter @xmath25 that fixes how many states are kept in the truncation determines the accuracy of the results . as we have seen in table",
    "[ table : lanc ] energies can decrease by increasing @xmath25 , while for observables like the local density the fluctuations become smaller .",
    "we have examined how the grand - canonical potential @xmath54 decreases when @xmath25 is increased in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig : nsd ] for a system of @xmath55 sites ( so that finite - size effects can be filtered out of this discussion ) in the sf phase but very close to the generic mott phase transition .",
    "this corresponds to the worst case scenario for our method .",
    "inclusion of just a few states leads to a rapid decrease in the grand - canonical potential , but once more than 20 states are kept , the potential decreases only very gradually . the exact result @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsd ] was again obtained by the sse - method , while with @xmath57 we reached @xmath58 . without source terms , we found that the calculated average grand - canonical potential per site was @xmath59 with @xmath60 , giving further evidence of the usefulness of the source terms .",
    "it is the sweeping property of the dmrg algorithm that could improve the results here substantially , something we tried to avoid from the onset since this property is computationally too costly in higher dimensions .",
    "the discrepancy with the exact result in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsd ] reduces rather slowly at higher values of @xmath25 , primarily because of the effects of block extension ( reflected in the curves of the local densities and local energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : brg ] for the same effect ) and complications due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the exact result should be recovered in the limit of @xmath25 equal to the dimension of the fock space for each block .",
    "in addition , for a system that is already deep in one of both phases , the mf+nrg method converges very rapidly to the exact result , as the energy curve shows in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : nsd ] for a system in the mott phase . here",
    ", the energy and grand potential differ only by a constant .",
    "on the other hand , the parameter @xmath25 also largely determines the required computer time : observables scale as @xmath61 per lattice site in memory cost , and the most time consuming operation is the rotation of variables , which scales as @xmath62 ( multiplication of matrices of order @xmath61 ) .",
    "all our calculations have been performed on a pentium iv , 1.6ghz or a pentium iii , each with 500 mb ram .",
    "larger lattices and higher values of @xmath25 can straightforwardly be implemented on more performant hardware , but requiring that all occupation numbers of the truncated states are arbitrarily small on the one hand and on the other hand wishing to study large lattices in high dimensions near a quantum phase transition is still not achievable .",
    "upper : the system is variational in the average grand - canonical potential per site @xmath63 . as the number of kept states @xmath25 is increased , the grand - canonical potential decreases .",
    "the full line is a guide to the eye .",
    "the parameters are chosen such that the system is near a generic phase transition on the sf side ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the worst case scenario for our method .",
    "the mean - field ( @xmath65 ) and exact ( corresponding to @xmath66 ) results are indicated .",
    "lower : the exponential convergence of the energy is shown .",
    "the system is deep in the mott phase with parameters @xmath67 and @xmath55.,height=226 ]    one of the crucial parameters of the method is the source term that is inserted at the boundary of each block .",
    "if we set it to zero , our method reduces to the standard nrg method . it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : brg ] that the fluctuations can be damped much better in a sf phase if we set the source term equal to the mf expectation value of the operator @xmath41 , while the total energy deviates now @xmath68 from to the exact result instead of @xmath69 without the source terms . for a homogeneous model in the thermodynamic limit , the value of @xmath70 should be site - independent and the source terms should be chosen equal as well .",
    "as argued in the previous section , the source terms are optional and need to be chosen carefully .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that a mott phase can only be found if @xmath71 = 0 $ ] .",
    "source terms might violate this condition near a mott - sf transition .",
    "the addition of source terms might lead to an incorrect prediction of a sf phase when the compensation of the source terms in the renormalization scheme is not complete .",
    "the source terms could yield contributions to states that are thrown away after truncation of the hilbert space and these contributions can be quite large when the parameter @xmath25 is chosen too low .",
    "this might lead to an incorrect value of the transition point .",
    "in addition , even if the transition point of a generic mott - sf phase transition was known exactly , and we would study the sf side of this transition , the source terms should still be chosen carefully . this can be understood as follows : any net contribution of a source term will deal with long - range correlations in the same way as mean - field does , and we know that the correlators predicted by mean - field are only valid in @xmath72 dimensions .",
    "e.g. the density is a valid order parameter for the generic mott - sf transition  @xcite , with @xmath73    briefly said , the source terms would in one and two dimensions lead to an improved mean - field theory , in the sense that the correlators would approximately have the same exponents as in mean - field theory and the mott lobe would extend a little bit farther into parameter space .",
    "this is also explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmu ] when @xmath25 is large enough , these possible dangers become less severe . in the confined case",
    ", any long - range correlations are effectively cut off and the addition of source terms is always expected to improve the calculations , as has been verified .",

    "local energy per site @xmath48 , local compressibility @xmath51 and local density @xmath8 from bottom to top are plotted as a function of the lattice index @xmath6 for a homogeneous model of 8 sites in a sf phase ( @xmath74 , the same values as the upper row in table  [ table : lanc ] ) .",

    "(  [ eq : scaling ] ) . in these calculations the source terms",
    "are set to zero and lattices of size @xmath55 sites were studied .",
    "inclusion of the source terms in one dimension would lead to a similar plot as in the 3d case.,height=226 ]    it was also tempting to study what happens if the blocks were extended by a single site only .",
    "that leads to the same number of diagonalizations but more rotations are needed . for the unconfined case ,",
    "this yielded quite good results , often smoother than in the block renormalization case .",
    "however , for the confined case this procedure did not produce regions with integer density and should hence only be used with great care .",
    "the mf+nrg procedure also offers a substantial improvement over mf results .",
    "the mf transition between the sf phase and the mott phase is independent of the dimension of the system and is located at @xmath75 , while a dmrg  @xcite study locates it at @xmath76 in one dimension and a strong - coupling expansion  @xcite locates it at @xmath77 in two dimensions .",
    "we have performed a simulation at @xmath78 in one , two and three dimensions . while mf theory predicts a sf phase ( calculation yields @xmath79 ) the true phase should be a mott phase in one and two dimensions and we even found a mott phase in three dimensions .",

    "now that we have critically examined the approximations made in the mf+nrg , we apply it to parameter regions where the results are unambiguous . in all calculations",
    "the size of the lattices corresponds to the maximal achievable size while a sufficient amount of states has been kept .",

    "choosing the parameter this way allows for nice fillings in the center and for densities going smoothly to zero near the edges of the trap .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : d1_1n ] we see how plateaus with local fillings of an integer number of bosons can arise as more and more particles enter the system .",
    "the global compressibility is never zero , as it is the case in the unconfined model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we can not speak therefore of a true quantum phase transition , the confining potential effectively cuts off all long range correlations .",

    "this means that the quantity of computational interest is the momentum distribution . in the original experimental setup ,",
    "the absorption images of the three dimensional distribution are taken along two orthogonal axes , revealing only the integral over the third direction .",

    "@xcite that satellite peaks in the momentum distribution are related to the appearance of a mott region in the center of the trap .",
    "once the mott region spanned almost the entire lattice , the peaks disappeared into the typical broad , low - peaked mott distribution .",
    "however , their worm monte - carlo calculation was only on a lattice of @xmath102 and it can be expected that for a larger lattice the central sf peak might be so dominant that the satellite peaks can hardly be resolved .",

    "the satellite peaks are only @xmath105 in magnitude of the central peak and will be difficult to resolve in practice . for the experimental setup with its lattice of about @xmath106 sites , the situation will even be worse .",

    "there are no satellite peaks when the central density is non - integer , despite a broad mott @xmath20 region for an on - site repulsion @xmath21 that is strong enough .",
    "this mott region is reflected in the tail of the momentum distribution  @xcite . for a system with local densities varying between @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( all non - integer densities ) ,",
    "we nevertheless found satellite peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom23 ] , and calculations showed the same behavior for densities ranging between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "the distribution is broad and not peaked , signaling virtually overall mott behavior . , height=226 ]    when going to higher values of @xmath21 and @xmath14 , it is in principle possible to have mott phases at @xmath111 and @xmath113 . in the mean - field phase diagram of the homogeneous model  @xcite ,",

    "hence in a small finite lattice it is not a priori clear if there are non - integer densities between the different broad mott regions . for a system with parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    ", we found very few non - integer densities . the density profile consisted of four plateaus with @xmath122 respectively .",

    "while there already exist broad mott regions with @xmath20 and @xmath111 , we did not witness any satellite peaks , because the mott behavior of the @xmath20 and @xmath111 plateaus already dominated the momentum distribution .",
    "+ we are led to the observation that it will be difficult to indicate the transition experimentally by satellite peaks , and that only examination of the intensity and the width of the central peak along one direction might be at hand to directly reveal mott behavior .",
    "in summary , we studied the bose - hubbard model subject to a confining field in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we combined the gutzwiller mean - field ( mf ) ansatz with a numerical ( block ) renormalization group method ( nrg ) and we could calculate observables like local densities , energies , the momentum distribution etc .",
    "the goal was to achieve variational results with energies much lower than in mean - field theory and at a low computational cost in order to make studies of large lattices in higher dimensions feasible .",
    "we have extensively discussed the advantages and limitations of this new method .",
    "the inclusion of source terms on the edges of the blocks improved results in the sf phase .",
    "+ we have examined the smooth transition between sf and mott regions in the presence of a confining field .",
    "although there is no real order parameter to be found in the momentum distribution , the momentum distribution can nevertheless reveal important qualitative differences between pure sf systems and systems with dominant mott behavior .",
    "these differences can experimentally best be seen in the central peak .",
    "possible satellite peaks might be difficult to resolve when the total number of confined particles is large and when the filling factors are not of order unity .",
