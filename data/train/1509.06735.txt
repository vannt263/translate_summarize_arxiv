    "it has been firmly established that in relativistic heavy ion collisions a hot , dense medium is rapidly formed , capable of interacting with the high partons produced in primordial hard scattering and making them lose some energy while traversing the medium  @xcite . such energy loss in the medium",
    "was first predicted in early 1980 s  @xcite .",
    "quantifying this energy loss is an important issue , because it is directly connected to the properties of the medium .",
    "however , this is not straightforward since neither the original parton energy , nor that of the decelerated one is easily accessible .",
    "back - to - back photon - jet pairs in principle give access to both the initial and final parton energy , but such events are rare , because they are suppressed by a factor @xmath12 , the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "measurement of jets give more complete information on the parton energy loss , however , their measurement is challenging , particularly at high multiplicities and low parton .",
    "to circumvent this , high hadrons are often used as proxies for jets ( `` leading hadrons '' ) , and the parton energy loss in principle can be calculated by proper comparison of the invariant yields of hadrons in and at a given . for this purpose the yields",
    "are usually scaled up by the expected number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in  , estimated from a glauber monte - carlo model , and in the absence of any initial or final state nuclear effects they are expected to coincide with the yields .",
    "the partons have steeply falling momentum spectra , so if partons lose energy , that results in a shift of the momentum spectra , and the yield at a given pt will become suppressed  @xcite . utilizing this fact ,",
    "the nuclear - modification factor ( ) has become a widely used characterization of the energy loss which is defined as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the production cross section of the respective hadron in collisions , @xmath15 is the nuclear overlap function averaged over the relevant range of impact parameters , and @xmath16 is the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions computed with @xmath17 . if is unity , it is usually assumed that the yield measured in collisions is explained by the primordial hard production as observed in collisions with no nuclear or medium effect .",
    "if  @xmath18  1 ( suppression ) the yield at a given is less than that expected from the scaled .",
    "while the parton energy loss is expected to depend both on system size and collision energy , it is remarkable that is very similar from =  62.4 to 200  gev at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and up to 2.76  tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the reason is that while the energy loss increases with increasing @xmath19 which would tend to decrease , the power @xmath20 in the @xmath21 shaped spectra decreases ( @xmath22 for 62.4  gev  @xcite , @xmath23 for 200  gev and @xmath24 for 2.76  tev  @xcite ) and provides a countervailing effect .",
    "a numerical calculation showed that the fractional energy loss of partons , @xmath25 , is indeed significantly different between lhc and rhic even though the is similar  @xcite .    instead of one can employ the fractional momentum loss ( ) of high hadrons as a measure of parton energy loss which should reflect the average fractional energy loss of the initial partons ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "is defined as @xmath27 where is the of the measurement and is that of the measurement scaled by the nuclear overlap function of the corresponding centrality class at the same yield of the  measurement .",
    "we calculate as a function of the original momentum of partons that are represented by .    under the assumptions that scaling is applicable and fragmentation functions",
    "are unchanged from collisions , @xmath28 can be directly measured as the shift in needed to get the same yield ( @xmath29 ) in as the scaled .",
    "the phenix experiment published a study of the energy loss of partons by converting azimuthal angle ( @xmath30)-dependent with respect to the event plane to assuming that the spectra follow a power - law function  @xcite .",
    "that study found that scales with @xmath31 , the distance from the center to the edge of the collision area which the partons traverse , for all centrality classes for 3@xmath328  , and also with the density - weighted path length @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the density at the center of the collision zone and the @xmath35 is the density at the given coordinate .",
    "the dependence of on centrality was also reasonably approximated by @xmath36 .",
    "a similar study has been performed using data available at lhc and data from rhic  @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the scaling in  @xcite does not hold at higher than 10  .",
    "other recent publications tried to obtain @xmath30-integrated without assuming the spectral shape  @xcite .",
    "it was found that varies by a factor of six from 62.4  gev to 2.76  tev collisions .",
    "these studies showed that the fractional momentum loss has a major advantage over , in that it allows for a direct comparison of parton energy loss between different colliding systems and energies , because it eliminates the bias owing to the -variation of the exponent , @xmath20 , in the power - law spectra of high particles .",
    "these scaling studies are not a replacement for full quantum - chromodynamics calculations of parton energy loss that must include different quark and gluon admixtures and their different fragmentation functions , initial state effects such as nuclear modified parton distribution functions , and potentially modified harmonization effects .",
    "that said , since is merely a new representation of the experimental measurements , any such theoretical calculation would need to describe the observed scalings at the precision of the uncertainties .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the previous studies of @xmath30-integrated by including additional data sets both from rhic and lhc and by plotting the fractional momentum loss against several scaling variables to characterize the energy loss mechanism .",
