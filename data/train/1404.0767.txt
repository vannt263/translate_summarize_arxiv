    "amorphous polymer materials are commonly used in various industrial products , such as packaging films , body materials , electro - photographic toners , adhesive agents , buffer materials , etc . from the viewpoints of the control of the viscoelastic and mechanical properties of these amorphous polymer materials , understanding of the dynamics of the polymer chain",
    "is one of the essentials of polymer science and engineering .",
    "the time - temperature superposition ( tts ) principle is a useful concept widely used for the analysis of the dynamic properties of a polymer.@xcite according to the time - temperature superposition , which assumes that all of the relaxation modes of a polymer chain obey the same temperature dependence , the dynamic material functions obtained at several different temperatures can be collapsed into a `` master '' curve by shifting the time scale of each function .",
    "the shifting coefficients , which are the so - called `` shift factor '' , are represented as a function of the temperature of the system .",
    "the dependence of the shift factor on temperature can be well described by the vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) or the williams - landel - ferry ( wlf ) equation , both being basically the same equation , and the equations are applicable above the glass transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) + ca .",
    "50 k. however , in the case when the system temperature approaches the @xmath0 , the breakdown of tts can be observed in many polymer systems.@xcite incidentally , the breakdown of tts of the dynamic material functions lead to the decoupling of stokes - einstein law of diffusion - viscosity relation at low temperature.@xcite using the viscoelastic and optical birefringence measurements of polystyrene , inoue and co - workers @xcite revealed that the stress relaxation of a polymer melt has two components .",
    "one ( r - component ) is related to the relaxation of the orientation of a polymer chain , which is well described by the rouse theory , and the other ( g - component ) is related to the relaxation of the transverse component of the monomeric motion on a length scale shorter than the shortest rouse mode .",
    "these two components have different temperature dependencies to each other .",
    "the g - component has the strongest temperature dependence versus that of the r - component .",
    "obviously , the existence of two relaxation modes having different temperature dependencies can be due to the breakdown of the tts of the viscoelastic functions .",
    "similarly , the tts of the dielectric relaxation also breaks down at a temperature close to the glass transition temperature for the polymer .",
    "the broadband dielectric relaxation measurements of amorphous polymer melts@xcite show a significant difference between the temperature dependencies of the relaxation times of the segment mode and the normal mode .",
    "the normal mode is a relaxation behavior due to fluctuation of the end - to - end vector of a polymer chain and the segment mode is one of several beaded monomer units .",
    "the ratio of the relaxation times between the normal mode ( @xmath8 ) and segmental mode ( @xmath9 ) is constant , as long as the tts can be applicable at a sufficiently higher system temperature than its @xmath0 , though the ratio ( @xmath10 ) gradually decreases when the system temperature is approaching the @xmath0 .",
    "the relaxation time of the segmental mode has a stronger temperature dependence than the ones of the normal mode .",
    "several lines of studies suggested that the difference in the temperature dependence between the chain and segmental relaxation times is due to dynamic heterogeneities at a temperature close to the @xmath0 of the polymer.@xcite however , the basic mechanism for the thermo - rheological complexity is still not completely understood.@xcite this investigation has been highly motivated by these studies concerned with the tts of polymer dynamics near the @xmath0 . in this study , the applicability of tts to the stress relaxation modulus functions @xmath11 of dense bead - spring polymer melts over a wide temperature and time range were evaluated .",
    "the effect of the chain rigidity in a polymer melt on its relaxation behavior in the glass - rubber transition regime will also be discussed in this study .",
    "in this section , the details of the simulation model and computational methods for the dense bead - spring polymer melt are described .",
    "the polymer molecules are represented by the soft - core spheres and the stretch and bending springs .",
    "two types of polymer chains were prepared ; one is the freely - jointed chain ( @xmath12 ) , which has a stretching spring between neighboring beads , while the other is the freely - rotating chain ( @xmath13 ) , which is the extension model of @xmath12 to describe the stiffness of the chain .",
    "@xmath13 has both stretching and bending springs .",
    "all monomers interact through the lennard - jones ( 12 - 6 ) potential @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the distance between two beads , @xmath16 is the ( finite ) distance at which the inter - particle potential is zero , and @xmath17 is the depth of the potential well .",

    "the simulation box with the periodic boundary condition includes 133 polymer chains of length n = 30 , and has 3990 particles in total .",
    "all the @xmath26 simulations of this study are performed by the cognac 8.0 codes.@xcite the production time step for integration is dt = 0.01@xmath27 , where @xmath27 is the unit of time @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the mass of the bead ( @xmath30 in this study ) .",

    "for all simulations in this study , the pressure of the system was set to zero ( @xmath33 )      in this study , @xmath34 is measured from the temperature dependence of the specific volume of a polymer melt .",
    "the specific volume of a polymer melt decreases with the decreasing temperature , but the shrinkage rate of the volume of the polymer melt changes to a lower value at a temperature close to @xmath34 .",
    "it was noted that such a volume change in the system will continuously occur , in contrast to the abrupt change in volume at the freezing point of a crystalline material .",
    "@xmath34 can be defined as the intersection of two regression lines of the specific volume versus the temperature in the liquid state and in the glassy state .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations of the dense bead - spring melts with the step - wise cooling from @xmath35 to @xmath36 with a rate of @xmath37 per @xmath38 was performed .",
    "the cooling rate @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",

    "the stress tensor should be calculated at every time step .",
    "however , it is inefficient to store and access such huge files of the values of the instantaneous stress components . to avoid this difficulty , the correlator algorithm described in ref .   was used .",
    "the algorithm utilizes the instantaneous stress values at every md step for the calculation of @xmath3 function , although using an array of correlators and an accumulator in this algorithm require only a small memory size to store the data .",
    "the temperature dependences of the specific volume of two bead - spring polymer melts ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the plotted volume data are the mean values from five independent md simulations .",
    "it is noted that there is no difference in the specific volume between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 melts at temperatures above the glass transition region .",
    "however , the glass transition region of @xmath13 melt begins at a higher temperature than that of the @xmath12 melt .",
    "both curves have an obvious bending point .",
    "the glass transition temperature was defined as the intersection point of two regression lines obtained from the lower and higher temperature regions than the bending point , and these obtained values are @xmath34 = 0.44 ( for @xmath12 ) and @xmath34 = 0.56 ( for @xmath13 ) .    ) of @xmath12 melt(upper ) and @xmath13 melt ( bottom ) as a function of temperature at the cooling rate of @xmath59 .",
    "the open circles represent the simulated volume data , and the dashed lines represent the regression results individually fitted to the volume data at temperatures lower and higher than the bending point of the function .",
    "the plotted data are obtained from five independent md runs of 2000 @xmath27.,height=377 ]      as mentioned in the introduction , the dynamic materials functions ( e.g. , a relaxation modulus , a diffusion coefficient , viscosity , creep compliance , etc . ) at several different temperatures can be coincided with a master curve by shifting the time scale of each function .",

    "eq.7 is derived based on the analogy of the classical rubber elasticity theory . in order to discuss the time - dependence of the horizontal shift factor , two shift factors(@xmath66 and @xmath67 )",
    "were defined at two different times ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are chosen at around the onset ( @xmath69 = 1 @xmath27 ) and middle ( @xmath68 = 100 @xmath27 ) of the time - range where the chain - relaxation is observed in the @xmath3 function at @xmath61 = 1 .",
    "@xmath68 is roughly equivalent to the time - scale of the relaxation of three or four segments , and @xmath69 is shorter than the relaxation time - scale of a dimer . due to the large fluctuations in the @xmath3 functions ,",

    "the pressures of all the systems treated in this study were set to zero .",
    "@xmath78 of the chain - relaxation regime is shifted to the right hand with the decreasing temperature , on the other hand , one of the bond - stretching relaxation regime migrates to up .",
    "therefore , the horizontal width between the end of a bond stretching relaxation regime and the onset of a chain - relaxation regime is gradually extended as the temperature decreases .",
