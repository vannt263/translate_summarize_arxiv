    "gauge field theories in two spatial dimensions have long been recognized as important for understanding several physical phenomena that can be well approximated as planar ones , like high temperature superconductors and the fractional quantum hall effect . in particular , chern - simons ( cs ) gauge theories have a special place in understanding these phenomena , not to mention the interest in their theoretical aspects on their own ( for a review , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "cs gauge theories exhibit a number of interesting properties .",
    "for example , it provides a mass term for the gauge field , while keeping renormalizability , without evoking spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "it can have the effect of statistical transmutation , attaching magnetic fluxes to a fermion or boson coupled to the gauge field and making them anyons  @xcite .",
    "another important aspect regarding cs gauge theories , when coupled to symmetry broken scalar potentials , is the existence of both topological and nontopological vortex solutions  @xcite .",
    "these vortices are charged and anyon - like solutions that may be of relevance in explaining several phenomena in planar condensed matter systems , like in high temperature superconductors and the fractional quantum hall effect , already mentioned above .",
    "vortex solutions have been shown to exist in both a maxwell - chern - simons - higgs ( mcsh ) model ( where both a kinetic maxwell term and a cs term are present ) as well in the chern - simons - higgs ( csh ) model ( in the absence of a maxwell term ) , where the vortices can have the property of self - duality , with the field equations reducing to first order differential equations  @xcite .    as far the physics of topological excitations like vortices",
    "are concerned , one important question is related to the possibility of condensation of these excitations in the system under appropriate conditions . under these circumstances",
    "most of the physical properties of the system should be determined by those of the condensate .",
    "condensation of topological excitations are believed to have relevance in the interpretation of many physical phenomena , like for instance in the confinement picture in dual formulations of gauge field theories  @xcite .",
    "we should also recall that there are many examples of physical systems in which phase transitions can be driven by topological excitations in quantum field theory as well as in condensed - matter physics  @xcite , which makes the study of condensation of nontrivial vacuum excitations of relevance in different contexts .",
    "it is known that the csh model exhibits a phase transition between a vortex condensed phase and one in which the vortices are not condensed  @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the vortex condensation in the csh model specialized to the case of the self - dual potential for the scalar field  @xcite , in which case vortices can be considered as noninteracting .",
    "this is used only for convenience , since then explicit expressions for the vortex energy and the dynamical mass for the vortices follow .",
    "other generic potentials could well be used , provided that it does not depend on the phase of the scalar field @xmath0 ( so depends only on the product @xmath1 ) and has a minimum at a non - zero value of @xmath0 . however , exact relations are not known for these more general potentials like for the self - dual one .",
    "vortex condensation in cs theories has been considered before , in the context of the self - dual models , in refs .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was formally shown that vortices should condense below some critical value for the cs coupling parameter .",
    "however , no exact prediction for this value of the cs parameter was made .",
    "also , being this condensation a transition point in the system , a determination of the order of this transition is also still lacking .",
    "these are important points that need to be addressed and that we will attempt to study in this paper , at least in part .",
    "the existence of nontrivial solutions of the vortex type implies that , when performing the path integral over the fields in the partition function , there will be contributions coming from field configurations corresponding to these vortex solutions and , under appropriate conditions ( depending on the values of the model parameters , for example ) , these solutions can dominate the partition function over constant vacuum configurations .",
    "this would then signal the possibility of condensation of these nontrivial vacuum excitations .",
    "our strategy to study the vortex condensation problem in the csh model is as follows .",
    "vortex excitations are made explicit in the functional action by making use of a series of dual transformations for the original lagrangian fields , obtaining an equivalent action , in which it becomes clear the vortex contributions . by properly matching our dual action to a field theory model ,",
    "it is then possible to write it in terms of a vortex field @xmath2 coupled to a vectorial field . in this process of writing the action in terms of an explicit vortex field , a dynamical mass for the vortices",
    "is generated . from the dynamical",
    "generated mass for the vortices we can then infer , already at the tree - level , about the possibility of vortex condensation . in this case",
    ", there is a critical value for the cs parameter where the dynamical mass for the vortices vanishes and these become energetically favorable to condense . we also calculate the one - loop self - energy corrections for the introduced vortex field to check the stability of the condensation point when quantum corrections are included .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the csh model and briefly review its usual vortex solutions . in sec .",
    "iii we derive the dual action , equivalent to the original action , but where the vortex excitation degrees of freedom can be made explicit . by matching this dual action to a field theory model , an appropriate vortex field can then be introduced .",
    "working in the london approximation , where scalar field fluctuations are frozen , we obtain an explicit expression for the dynamical mass term for the vortex field that emerges naturally in the passage from the vortex coordinates to the vortex field . the point for vortex condensation",
    "is then derived from the dynamical mass term for the vortex field . in sec .",
    "iv we compute the self - energy corrections for the vortex field in the dual model and investigate the change of the tree - level vortex condensation point when one - loop quantum corrections are considered .",
    "our conclusions and final remarks are given in sec .",
    "let us consider the abelian csh model , defined in terms of a complex scalar field @xmath0 and abelian gauge field @xmath3 .",

    "note also that in @xmath14 dimensions , a sixth - order potential in the scalar field still gives a renormalizable theory . in the following",

    "<S> the contribution of nontrivial vacuum ( topological ) excitations , more specifically vortex configurations of the self - dual chern - simons - higgs model , to the functional partition function is considered . by using a duality transformation , </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at a representation of the partition function in terms of which explicit vortex degrees of freedom are coupled to a dual gauge field . by matching the obtained action to a field theory for the vortices , the physical properties of the model in the presence of vortex excitations are then studied . in terms of this field theory for vortices in the self - dual chern - simons higgs model , </S>",
    "<S> we determine the location of the critical value for the chern - simons parameter below which vortex condensation can happen in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of self - energy quantum corrections to the vortex field are also considered . </S>"
