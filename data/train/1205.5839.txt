    "the kreutz system of sungrazing comets ( e.g. , kreutz 1888 , 1891 , 1901 , marsden 1967 , 1989 , 2005 , sekanina 2002a , 2003 , sekanina & chodas 2004 , 2007 , 2008 ) offers the ultimate example of an advanced phase of cascading fragmentation ( sekanina & chodas 2007 ) , a process that was shown to occur throughout the orbit , including the aphelion region ( 150200 au from the sun ) .",
    "separation velocities acquired by fragments at each fragmentation event generate orbit variations that depend strongly on the breakup s heliocentric distance ( sekanina 2002a ) . at a single",
    "tidally - triggered or tidally - assisted event in the immediate proximity of perihelion ( which takes place in the sun s inner corona ) , a separation velocity of 1 m s@xmath3 causes the two fragments to return to perihelion at times that are typically some 80 years apart .",
    "the same separation velocity at a single nontidal splitting event far from the sun , including the aphelion region , affects the orbital period hardly at all , but , depending on the velocity s direction , can introduce material changes in the other orbital elements : up to @xmath4 @xmath5 ( 1 @xmath5 = sun s radius or 0.0046548 au ) in the perihelion distance ( thus allowing some fragments to collide with the sun s photosphere at the next perihelion passage ) , up to @xmath05@xmath6 in the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of perihelion , and up to @xmath01@xmath6 in the orbit inclination .",
    "given that the separation velocity can easily reach a few meters per second , the resulting effects on the orbital elements substantially exceed those by the indirect planetary perturbations considered by marsden ( 1967 ) .    the observed long - term temporal distribution of the bright sungrazers does indeed show a tendency toward clumping , with the interval between two consecutive clusters averaging about 80 years ( e.g. , marsden 1967 , sekanina & chodas 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , the four major fragments of comet c/1882 r1 , the brightest known member of the kreutz system since the beginning of the 18th century ( kreutz 1888 , 1891 ) were found to have _ actual _ orbital periods that increase also with an average step of 80 years , from @xmath0600 to @xmath0840 years ( sekanina & chodas 2007 ) .    considering this recurrence cycle , given that the two most recent clusters of bright kreutz sungrazers peaked in the 1880s and 1960s , noting that the clusters were preceded , two to more than three decades earlier , by precursor sungrazers , and also recognizing that the arrival rate of soho kreutz system comets has been climbing ever since the launch of the spacecraft ( sekanina & chodas 2007 , knight et al .",

    ", the question has arisen whether this is indeed the first major member of the predicted 21st - century cluster .",
    "the answer depends critically on the accurate determination of the comet s orbital period @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath7 is about 400 years or shorter , the comet should be a fragment of one of the sungrazers reported in the course of the 17th - century or even more recently , and has nothing in common with a new cluster .",
    "on the other hand , if the orbital period is substantially longer than 400 years , then c/2011 w3 should indeed belong to the new cluster .",

    "when discovered on november 27 , c/2011 w3 had only @xmath018 days to reach perihelion ( which occurred on 2011 december 16.0 ut ) , and there was little hope for an accurate determination of the orbital period from preperihelion data , regardless of their quality .",
    "observing circumstances were unfavorable for ground - based imaging , since the comet s elongation from the sun was rapidly decreasing , from 50@xmath6 at discovery to merely 17@xmath12.6 on december 10 , when its position was measured from the ground for the last time before perihelion .",
    "still , more than 100 astrometric positions were obtained during this two - week period ( spahr et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) , the great majority of which was sufficiently accurate and mutually consistent to be used for deriving a high - quality set of elements , except for the orbital period .",
    "for example , two sets of elliptical elements computed by williams ( 2011a , 2011b ) from 91 observations between november 27 and december 8 and from 94 observations between november 27 and december 10 , gave osculating orbital periods of , respectively , years ( leaving a mean residual of @xmath130@xmath14 ) and years ( leaving @xmath130@xmath15 ) .",
    "around perihelion , from december 11 to 22 , the comet was too close to the sun to obtain any astrometric positions from the ground .",
    "the comet was , however , extensively observed with instruments on board several satellites and deep - space probes .",
    "astrometric data were in fact extracted from the comet s images seen in the coronagraphs and other imaging devices on the soho and both stereo spacecraft ( kracht 2011 , 2012 , spahr et al.2012 ) .",
    "the coverage of the comet s motion by the three spacecraft was excellent over this period of time , as is apparent from table 1 .",
    "we use the standard abbreviations for the relevant instruments :  c2 and c3 for the two coronagraphs on the soho spacecraft and cor1 for the inner coronagraph , cor2 for the outer coronagraph , and hi1 for the first heliospheric imager on either of the two stereo spacecraft .",
    "included in table 1 is the spatial resolution of the instruments , based on the information from brueckner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for soho and from howard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for stereo .",
    "the astrometric data from the measured images of the comet obtained by these instruments turned out to be so poor that they could not be combined with the ground - based positions , often of a subarcsec accuracy , to derive high - quality orbital solutions .",
    "the best among the spaceborne data are the six positions obtained by kracht ( 2011 ) from the cor2 images of stereo - b between december 16.49 and 16.57 ut , shortly after perihelion , but even they are not accurate enough to be included in the final iteration of the orbit .    the extensive sets of images taken by the various instruments on board the soho and stereo spacecraft prove more useful for examining the comet s dust - tail morphology ( sec .",
    "10 ) and may also be useful for studying the light curve in the general proximity of perihelion , even though many of the ccd frames show the comet s head saturated .",
    "we will not discuss the complex issues of the soho and stereo photometry , but would like to call attention to a few very preliminary findings from our cursory inspection of the images taken with the c2 and c3 coronagraphs on board soho .",
    "most of the inspected images display the saturation artifact known as `` blooming , '' which has for similar integration times been assumed to measure approximately the amount of excess brightness by the number of affected pixels and therefore by the length of the overflow streak .",
    "implementation of this admittedly oversimplified rule does , however , lead to conclusions that are consistent with the results based on firmer , independent evidence addressed later in this paper .",
    "it appears that the comet s activity became significantly lower very close to perihelion over a period of several hours .",
    "this apparent attenuation is almost certainly a product of intensive sublimation of dust , as examined in some detail in secs .",
    "10 and 11 .    in any case",
    ", it seems that the comet s brightness reached a maximum about 0.3 day before perihelion , followed by rapid fading .",
    "up to three subsequent outbursts ( some perhaps multiple ) may have occurred , peaking at , respectively , 0.4 , 0.8 , and about1@xmath16 days after perihelion , or on december 16.4 , 16.8 , and @xmath017.5 ut .",
    "a rigorous study of the light curve should verify these preliminary results .",
    "although , astonishingly , the comet was imaged in daylight from the ground as early as 12 days after perihelion by several observers ( kronk 2011 ) , the frames contained no reference stars to derive the comet s astrometric positions . among these early postperihelion observations was a set of images taken by a group of czech observers between december 17.4 and 20.3 ut , who used a robotic , remotely controled telescope , a fram 30-cm f/10 schmidt cassegrain reflector of the pierre auger observatory at malargue , argentina . while no astrometry was possible , comparison of the images obtained on the four days ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows major changes in the appearance of the comet s head ( ern 2011 ) . from december 17",
    "to 18 the nuclear condensation seemed to have grown and brightened a little , extending in a broad fan in the tailward direction , but otherwise the morphology remained essentially the same . from december 18 to 19 the change was more pronounced ; even though the nuclear condensation remained clearly visible , the quasi - parabolic contours of the tail became filled with much more material and one can discern a streamer that extended for a few arcminutes nearly along the tail axis .",
    "should it persist and change its orientation predictably with time , such a feature is diagnostic of a sudden , brief outburst of dust from the nucleus ( sec .",
    "5 ) . by itself , an event of this kind may or may not be part of a cataclysmic process that results in the demise of the nucleus .",
    "but the stunning change in the comet s appearance between december 19 and 20 strongly suggests that during this episode , portended by the morphological changes during the previous days , the nucleus entirely disintegrated . on december 20 the nuclear condensation",
    "_ completely disappeared _ ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "the streamer , usually referred to as a spine tail and much longer and more prominent now than the previous day , dominated the comet s head and near - tail region .    on december 20",
    "the comet was imaged at malargue for the last time .",
    "although the spaceborne observations with the hi1 imagers on both the stereo - a and stereo - b spacecraft continued past this date ( table 1 ) , their spatial resolution was not sufficient to show the changes detected with clarity in the malargue images . fortunately , the observing conditions on the ground were generally improving as the comet s elongation from the sun steadily continued to increase , and after a three - day gap earth - based monitoring of the comet s head region resumed .",
    "the continuation of the high - resolution monitoring of the comet was very important for finding out whether the loss of the nuclear condensation , so unambiguously documented by the december 20 imaging , became indeed permanent and irreversible . if the nucleus did indeed disappear , there would be no definite point to bisect , and this condition would seem to thwart any attempt at getting accurate postperihelion astrometric data and computing a high - quality set of orbital elements , including a well - determined orbital period .    starting on december 23 ,",
    "a systematic series of observations of what remained of the comet was begun by mcnaught ( 2012 ) with the uppsala 50-cm f/3.5 schmidt telescope of the siding spring survey in australia . as seen from the examples displayed in fig .  2 , the comet had nearly the same appearance in all images taken between december 23 and january 18 , fully confirming the morphology in the malargue images of december 20 .",
    "there was no trace of a nuclear condensation , only a gradually vanishing `` hood '' at the sunward end of a faint feature with quasi - parabolic contours , on which a much brighter , rectilinear , spine - like tail was superimposed . in the absence of a better choice , mcnaught measured what he perceived as possible candidate positions for the tip of the tail at its sunward end , arguably the least objectionable substitute for the missing nucleus .    in spite of this handicap ,",
    "mcnaught s imaging observations provide useful information by allowing one to measure rather precisely ( with a @xmath131@xmath6 precision ) the systematic clockwise rotation of the spine tail , clearly apparent from fig .  2 . combined with the measurements of the streamer on the malargue exposures from december 1920 ,",
    "the position angle data measured by the authors are listed in table 2 .",
    "each of the measured orientations in column 2 was compared with a set of calculated position angles of _ synchronic _ features , loci of dust particles of different sizes subjected to a range of accelerations by solar radiation pressure but released from the nucleus at the same time ( e.g. , finson & probstein 1968 ) .",
    "the distribution of the times of particle release , for which the synchrones position angles match exactly the measured orientations , have shown a sharp concentration in time , with a random scatter of less than @xmath130.4 day , providing evidence that the spine tail was indeed a product of a major , fairly brief outburst ( or a rapid sequence of outbursts ) that peaked on december @xmath17 ut , about 1.6 days after perihelion ; the comet was then au from the sun .",
    "( for a preliminary report , see sekanina 2012 . )",
    "the predicted variations of the spine tail until mid - february 2012 are displayed in fig .",
    "the event of december 17.6 ( be it single or multiple ) , which is possibly identical with the last of the three postperihelion outbursts mentioned at the end of sec .  3 , must have begun only a fraction of a day earlier , probably about december 17.2 ut , and led to the disappearance of the nuclear condensation some 22@xmath16 days later and to the termination of activity ( sec .",
    ". although details of this process are unknown at present , it exhibits characteristics very similar to those of the cataclysmic fragmentation of another sungrazer , comet c/1887 b1 ( e.g. , kreutz 1901 ; marsden 1967 , 2005 ; sekanina 1984 , 2002a ; sekanina & chodas 2004 ) .",
    "this general conclusion is supported by the absence , from december 20 on , of any traces of a second tail that would have contained freshly ejected dust ; such a tail would have preceded the spine tail some 5@xmath6 to 7@xmath6 in the clockwise direction .",

    "fortunately , mcnaught communicated the results of his continuing observations to one of our colleagues , who provided us with the information conveyed ( chesley 2012 ) . the outcome is 46 astrometric positions of the tip of the spine tail , in addition to the three from december 2324 already published ( spahr et al .",
    "2012 ) . in the following",
    "we describe a novel technique that we devised to exploit this set of mcnaught s astrometric observations , together with his images of the spine tail .",
    "the goal is to extract accurate positions of the missing nucleus and to employ them in our orbit - determination efforts .",
    "every dust particle released from a comet s nucleus pursues its own orbit in space , which differs from , and is independent of , the comet s subsequent orbit .",
    "the orbital deviations are determined by the release time and circumstances as well as the magnitude of solar radiation pressure that the particle has been subjected to after release .",
    "radiation pressure forces the particle to move in a field of reduced effective gravity compared with that acting on the comet .",
    "the field intensity is described by the ratio @xmath22 between the acceleration @xmath23 due to radiation pressure and the sun s gravitational acceleration @xmath24 . if @xmath25 is the gravitational constant and @xmath26 the mass of the sun , then , at a heliocentric distance @xmath27 , , whereas the acceleration @xmath28 is given as a product of radiation pressure , @xmath29 , and the particle s effective cross sectional area for radiation pressure , @xmath30 , per its mass , @xmath31 . here , with @xmath32 being the sun s total radiation energy emitted per unit time and",
    "@xmath33 the speed of light , while @xmath30 is the product of the particle s geometrical cross sectional area , @xmath34 , and the efficiency for radiation pressure , @xmath35 .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 can thus be written in the form ( e.g. , sekanina et al .",
    "2001 ) @xmath36 where the last expression on the right applies specifically to a spherical grain of a bulk density @xmath37 ( in g @xmath38 ) and diameter @xmath39 ( in @xmath40 m ) . for large particles ( tens of microns across and larger ) (",
    "the effective cross section for radiation pressure is nearly identical to the geometrical cross section ) and @xmath22 is generally smaller than 0.1 . for particles released from a comet orbiting the sun in a nearly parabolic path , even this small value of @xmath22 suffices to force the dust move in distinctly hyperbolic orbits _ concave _ to the sun . for strongly absorbing submicron - sized grains @xmath22 can easily exceed unity ( a field with acceleration by radiation pressure exceeding gravitational acceleration ) , and such particles move in hyperbolic orbits _ convex _ to the sun . in the special case of , particles",
    "are subjected to no force and therefore move along straight lines .    as follows from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the ratio @xmath22 is generally independent of heliocentric distance .",
    "however , the situation gets a little more complicated when the comet is extremely close to the sun , as briefly discussed in sec.11 .    it is because of the effects of solar radiation pressure that the dust particles of different sizes released during a brief outburst line up in the tail along a synchrone , on which the nucleus is located at . and",
    "because the motions of these particles through the tail are independent of any changes in the comet s motion and behavior _ after _ the outburst , including any misfortunes that the nucleus may then incur , the undisturbed positions of the missing nucleus can be recovered from the motion of the synchrone , if one can determine the point at which . without an additional constraint",
    "the projected position of a disintegrated nucleus is increasingly uncertain , but primarily in one dimension only , _ along _ the synchrone .    in practice",
    ", a synchrone has a finite breadth for a variety of reasons : a finite duration of the outburst ; being the product of a sequence of outbursts ; and/or dust particles acquiring lateral velocities upon their release .",
    "the general tendency for the synchronic features in the dust tails of comets is to get broader with time , which gradually increases the positional uncertainty _ across _ the synchrone .    over a limited range of fairly low @xmath22 values ,",
    "the synchrone is a straight line with very high precision ( often to better than @xmath130@xmath12.1 in the position angle ) .",
    "if the tip of the spine tail of c/2011 w3 measured by mcnaught is located on the synchrone s axis , the coordinates of the tip and the spine tail s orientation define the synchrone s equation that also fits the undisturbed position of the missing nucleus .",
    "if are the measured equatorial coordinates of the tip of the spine tail and @xmath41 is the tail s position angle at time @xmath42 , the equatorial coordinates of the missing nucleus , , must satisfy a condition @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are in hours and @xmath46 and @xmath47 in degrees .    to further constrain the equatorial coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath46 , we recall from sec .  2 that the quality and congruence of the astrometric positions from the preperihelion ground - based observations allowed us to determine accurate sets of orbital elements , except for the osculating period @xmath7 .",
    "if these early astrometric data are used to fit orbits with a number of different _ forced _ values of the orbital period , the missing nucleus must at any given time be located on this _ line of orbital - period variation _",
    "computed for that time .",
    "this condition provides a second constraint on the equatorial coordinates of the missing nucleus , which can readily be found as those of the _ point of intersection _ of the line of orbital - period variation with the line that satisfies the equation of synchrone in eq .",
    "this result also provides useful information on the orbital period @xmath7 and determines the separation distance of the measured tip of the spine tail from the missing nucleus and thereby the critical value of @xmath22 for the largest dust grains that are detected at the tail s tip .    because of the lack of any reliable information on the orbital period at the beginning of this exercise , it is necessary to search for the solution iteratively . in the first approximation ,",

    "on the one hand , we learnt that the preperihelion observations alone were inadequate to provide such a set . on the other hand , we found ourselves in an unenviable situation in regard to the sources of postperihelion ground - based data , with no astrometry possible either because of the absence of reference stars in images in which the comet still possessed a nuclear condensation ( to bisect in a measuring machine ) or because of the loss of the condensation ( when reference stars were plentiful ) . under these circumstances",

    "the average orbital period resulting from this exercise was equal to years .",
    "we got ready for a second iteration by inspecting the used positional data in the orbital run .",
    "having found a solution that is much closer to the true orbital period of the comet , we were no longer critically dependent on the postperihelion data points from stereo - b .",

    "the angular distance @xmath72 was increasing nonuniformly , but steadily , with time , resembling the rate of recession of a separated companion fragment from the nucleus of its parent comet .",
    "the tabulated topocentric positions of the missing nucleus were at this point incorporated into the input file for the final orbit determination run .",
    "it should be remembered that mcnaught s intention was to measure positions of the candidates of the tail s tip , not positions of extreme points on the tail s _ axis _ , which would be ideal for our orbit determination efforts .",
    "on the days on which he took more than one image , it is likely that the tail s tip candidates differed from image to image , as is abundantly clear from his comments to williams ( 2011c ) . and as the spine tail steadily broadened , the chance that any measured tip candidate happened to be in fact located very close to the axis became increasingly remote .",
    "one should therefore expect that for only some of the derived astrometric positions of the missing nucleus will the residuals from the final orbit be acceptable for the orbit determination run .",
    "also expected is that the quality of these positions should deteriorate with the spine tail s growing breadth and therefore with time .",
    "the final orbital solution , which includes the relativistic effect , is presented in table 4 .",
    "it is based on a total of 123 observations between 2011 november 27 and 2012 january 6 , all ground - based , which left in either coordinate a residual not exceeding 5@xmath11 . of these , 96 are preperihelion ( from november 27 to december 10 ) and 27 are postperihelion .",
    "all postperihelion entries come from table 3 .",
    "this means that the position of the missing nucleus was successfully recovered from nearly 60 percent of mcnaught s positions of the tail s tip from images he took between decmeber 23 and january 6 .",
    "given the odds our approach was facing , we consider this number to be quite satisfactory . as expected , the three positions between january 12 and 18 turned out to offer unacceptable residuals , and the starting position from january 12 was clearly incorrect .",

    "this suggests that there may exist yet another subcategory of bright sungrazers that has never been considered in the evolutionary models of the kreutz system .",
    "table 4 also shows the results of integrating the orbit back one revolution about the sun , to the early 14th century , suggesting the presence of fairly minor perturbations .",
    "the related issues and implications of the comet s orbit are addressed in sec .  13 .",
    "besides the clearly apparent clockwise rotation of the spine tail , both the malargue images in fig .  1 and the siding spring images in fig .  2",
    "show a quasi - parabolic envelope , in which the spine tail is immersed and which , based on its approximate axial orientation , may have originated from the previous outburst that peaked on about december 16.8 ut or 0.8 day after perihelion ( sec .",
    "3 ) . while the spine tail dominates the images brightness - wise , the previous outburst was apparently more violent , as suggested by a much greater breadth of the envelope and , consequently , much higher ejection velocities of the released dust . indeed ,",
    "if the width of the spine tail and the envelope are both due entirely to lateral velocities of the particles at the time of release , these velocities come out to be typically up to m s@xmath3 for the spine tail , but up to at least 150 m s@xmath3 for the envelope . whereas the latter velocities are fairly typical of microscopic dust ejected due to an interaction with outflowing gas , the former are so unusually low that they suggest that the entire residual mass of the nucleus simply collapsed .",
    "one may question whether the episode that led to the formation of the spine tail can at all be called an outburst",
    ". it may be more appropriate to refer to it as a _ cataclysmic fragmentation event _ or _ terminal collapse _ or _ complete disintegration _ , but we continue to use all these terms interchangeably even after we address the physical nature of the process in sec .  12 .",
    "the distribution of surface brightness along the spine tail , which displays a broad maximum at some distance from the sunward tip in all mcnaught s images , is positively peculiar .",
    "the gradual rise in the near - head brightness with increasing distance from the nucleus is anomalous in that it contradicts a typical power law for the particle - size distribution of dust comets . in a low - ejection - velocity approximation , the finson - probstein ( 1968 )",
    "approach provides the following expression for the variation of the surface brightness @xmath91 as a function of the radiation - pressure acceleration parameter @xmath22 along a synchronic feature observed at a time @xmath92 and made up of dust particles released from the nucleus at a time @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the geometric albedo of the particles , @xmath96 their phase function at a phase angle @xmath97 [ normalized to @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the differential distribution function of particle diameters @xmath39 , @xmath27 is the heliocentric distance , and @xmath100 is a jacobian that converts the radial and transverse rectangular coordinates , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , into @xmath22 and @xmath103 @xmath104 { \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial \\beta } }   & { \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial \\tau } } \\end{array } \\right| .\\ ] ] at a geocentric distance @xmath105 , the coordinates @xmath101 and @xmath102 are projected onto the tangent plane of the sky at the comet s nucleus and reckoned from it , @xmath101 pointing away from the sun and @xmath102 being normal to it in either direction , as only the absolute value of @xmath100 is used in eq .",
    "we have already mentioned that at small values of @xmath22 ( say , ) , the population of particles released at a time @xmath93 and accelerated at a rate @xmath22 is located at an angular distance @xmath106 from the nucleus , which is proportional to @xmath22 , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a constant . similarly , for small values of @xmath22 , and , while and , so that for such large particles @xmath109 and @xmath110 since the exponent @xmath111 for the size - distribution function of cometary dust is typically in the range of 3.5 to 4.0 ( e.g. , sitko et al .  2011 ) , the surface brightness along the spine tail of c/2011 w3 is expected to drop with increasing distance @xmath106 from the nucleus with some power of @xmath106 , usually between @xmath112 and @xmath113 . from eq .",
    "( 12 ) it is obvious that the condition @xmath114 in the part of the spine tail between the tip and the peak surface brightness implies a condition @xmath115 such an extremely steep size distribution function can only be explained by crumbling of the largest particles ( say , @xmath116 cm ) into progressively smaller ones .",
    "crude visual inspection of mcnaught s spine - tail images suggests that the surface brightness attains the peak near , or at particle diameters of @xmath0400 to 500 @xmath40 m , independent of the observation time .",
    "it is therefore possible that the fragmentation process essentially terminated once fragments of large debris were reduced to sizes of @xmath0100 @xmath40 m .",
    "it is hoped that eventually a detailed light curve will be available for comet c/2011 w3 . at this time ,",
    "however , only fragmentary information has been published . with the brightness data collected primarily from spahr et al .",

    "the plotted magnitudes were all identified by the observers as total , either visual or ccd , and were corrected by us for personal and instrumental effects to the limited degree possible and referred to the visual photometric system of an average unaided eye .",
    "the phase - effect correction is important especially for the postperihelion observations , for which the phase angle was varying between 90@xmath6 and 130@xmath6 and the effects of forward scattering of sunlight were significant .",
    "the comet was much brighter after perihelion than before , unquestionably due to its cataclysmic fragmentation ( secs .  5 and 8) .",
    "figure 6 does not explicitly show the outbursts that are mentioned in sec .  3 , but this is hardly significant given the poor coverage of the light curve near the sun and low accuracy of the data . from fig .  6",

    "if the visual brightness at the time were due entirely to scattering of sunlight by dust released from the disintegrating nucleus into the atmosphere , one could readily compute the total cross sectional area of the particulate material , once a value for the geometric albedo of the optically thin cloud is adopted . in practice , unfortunately , sodium atoms radiating in the doublet near 5900  are a strong contributor to the visual brightness of soho sungrazing comets ( biesecker et al .",
    "2002 ) , so that the light curve provides us with only an upper limit to the cross sectional area of the dust particles and indirectly to the mass of the disintegrated nucleus .    an independent approach to determining the amount of released dust is to estimate the total visual brightness of the comet s tail at a time sufficiently long after the fragmentation process has been completed .",
    "because the tail includes all dust released by the comet since its perihelion passage , the result in this case is an estimate of the mass of the nucleus at , or very shortly after , perihelion .",
    "this result would represent a lower limit :  not only would all sodium have sublimated away and ionized long before such an observation , but by this time the surface brightness of some of the released debris would have already dropped below the detection threshold of visual observers .",
    "the immediate goal of either of the two approaches is the determination of @xmath134 , the effective visual magnitude of the estimated light scattered by the debris , normalized to the heliocentric and geocentric distances of 1 au with an inverse square power law , to a zero phase angle with the marcus ( 2007 ) formula , and to the photometric system of an average unaided eye .",
    "expressed in km@xmath135 , the effective cross sectional area of the dust in the cloud , @xmath136 , is given by an equation @xmath137 where @xmath95 is the geometric albedo of the dust , for which we use a value of 0.04 ( e.g. , lamy et al .",

    "1989 ) , so that adopting a lower limit of @xmath40 m seems to be justified .    the exponent @xmath111 of the power law and the upper limit @xmath121 were in this exercise varied . in conformity with the findings for a large number of comets",

    ", he determined the total brightness of the dust tail in the field of view ( of an estimated diameter of @xmath03@xmath6 ) of his 25@xmath154100 binocular telescope at three angular distances @xmath106 from the head that he estimated at magnitude 4.8 .",

    "since seargent could detect no tail with his binocular telescope beyond @xmath023@xmath6 from the head , we assume in our conservative estimate that it ended there .",
    "the whole tail was then brighter by a factor of @xmath156 , or 2.2 magnitudes , than the average in each 3@xmath6 band , which leads to a lower limit of , or 2 magnitudes fainter than indicated by @xmath157 from the light curve .",
    "consequently , the lower limit on the total cross sectional area of the comet s dust released after perihelion is km@xmath135 . to obtain lower limits on the mass and diameter estimates , the values in table 5 should be multiplied by 0.16 and 0.54 , respectively .",
    "it appears that the derived lower limit is relatively secure .",
    "seargent s value for the brightness of the head is about 0.9 magnitude below the light curve in fig .",
    "6 ( suggesting a personal magnitude scale difference ) and our truncation of the tail s length also adds a few tenths of a magnitude , because it implies a loss of light in the binocular magnitudes relative to those obtained with the unaided eye .",
    "a fairly narrow range resulting from the two entirely independent approaches applied is encouraging and may indicate that upon the terminal breakup all atomic sodium escaped very rapidly , leaving hardly any lasting signature in the comet s light curve , given that at 0.144 au from the sun the na photoionization lifetime is less than 1 hour ( huebner , keady , & lyon 1992 ; also :  cremonese et al .",
    "1997 , combi , disanti , & fink 1997 ) .",
    "because of the unacceptably large mass estimates , greatly exceeding 10@xmath158 grams , we suggest that the exponent @xmath111 of the size - distribution power law in table 5 could not possibly be near or below 3.5",
    ". however , there are fairly good odds that the nucleus could have been as large as 150200 meters in diameter and that it could have had a residual mass as much as @xmath010@xmath2 grams shortly after passing through perihelion .",
    "examining eleven of the brighter soho kreutz - system comets with prominent tails , all on their way to perihelion between 1996 and 1998 , sekanina ( 2000 ) noticed that the narrow and nearly straight tails deviated strikingly from the antisolar direction .",
    "the highest solar radiation - pressure accelerations , to which the dust in the tails was subjected , was found to have been @xmath159 , suggesting the presence of a population of submicron - sized grains dielectric in nature , most probably silicates ( e.g. , sekanina et al.2001 and the references listed there in sec .",
    "the sampled comets also showed rather consistently that the peak production of dust occurred some 2030 @xmath5 from the sun , about 1 day before perihelion , and that activity essentially terminated shortly afterwards .",
    "detailed modeling of one of these objects showed that its tail was a syndyname of @xmath159 far from the head , but a synchrone referring to a release time of 0.8 day before perihelion ( 19 @xmath5 from the sun ) , near the head . a sharp bend or knee , but no gap , separated the two parts of the tail .",
    "the author suggested that the time of the abrupt termination was possibly nuclear - size dependent ( sekanina 2000 ) .    to learn more about this possible relation and about the dust - emission pattern of comet c/2011 w3",
    ", we have examined the properties of its tail both before and after perihelion .",
    "two images taken by the c3 coronagraph on board the soho spacecraft shortly before perihelion , on december 15.504 and 15.796 ut , are reproduced in fig .",
    "cursory inspection reveals a tail whose curvature is slight but increases with time , with no obvious knee .",
    "two syndynames are plotted for each image in the right - hand side panel :  the one on the left corresponds to @xmath160 , the other to @xmath159 .",

    "2001 ) :  the first is the highest acceleration known to affect dust in comets and is typical of strongly absorbing grains ( such as carbon - rich , organic material ) , whereas the second , as mentioned above , is characteristic of the peak acceleration on dielectric grains ( such as silicates ) . in both cases the particles involved are in the submicron - size range .",
    "superposition of the syndynames on the images in fig .",
    "7 shows for both observation times that the tail lies largely between the two syndynames and that it is slightly less curved than either of them .",
    "a conclusion from these images alone is that c/2011 w3 was releasing both dielectric and absorbing dust on its way to perihelion .",
    "the main difference between the two syndynames in fig .",
    "7 is that at a given distance from the nucleus , the dust on the syndyname of was released much earlier than that on the syndyname of .",
    "it is instructive to compare the comet s appearance in the two preperihelion images with very different views offered shortly after perihelion by the soho c2 coronagraph in combination with the cor1 and cor2 coronagraphs on board the stereo - a and stereo - b spacecraft .",
    "the three selected images are of course merely snapshots of continuous changes in the comet s figure that are fully revealed only by the dynamic , time - lapse imaging that involves the entire data set .",
    "nevertheless , given the spatial distribution of the three spacecraft , the stereoscopic quality of the gained information makes even snapshot views extremely valuable .",
    "figure 8 shows the comet s head and a part of its tail in a frame taken with the c2 coronagraph on december 16.117 ut , or 0.105 day after perihelion . the bright tail , to the south - southeast of the sun ,",
    "is entirely disconnected from the head .",
    "the panel to the right of the image , showing the complete syndyname , suggests that , contrary to the observation , the tail should have reappeared to the northwest of the occulting disk .",
    "the comet s head , although clearly saturated and displaying some `` blooming '' , is essentially stellar in appearance .",
    "this means that no detectable postperihelion tail developed by the time the image was taken , about 0.1 day after perihelion .",
    "an example of the peculiar appearance of c/2011 w3 is presented in fig .",
    "9 , which shows the comet imaged with the cor2 coronagraph on board the stereo - a spacecraft on december 16.246 ut , or 0.234 day after perihelion . unlike in the soho s c2 coronagraph ,",
    "the comet now consists of three components : the head  with a short wisp of a new tail that must have begun to develop before 0.2 day after perihelion  to the east - northeast of the sun and two separate branches of the old tail , one to the southeast and the second to the northwest of the sun .",
    "the southeastern branch is relatively sharp but faint , a far cry from its luster in fig .",
    "it can be matched with the syndyname , but the resolution is poor as the syndynames along this tail are `` crowded '' .",
    "the northwestern branch is blob shaped .",
    "its first view in this cor2 coronagraph coincided approximately with the re - appearance of the comet s head from behind the occulting disk , nearly 3 hours after perihelion . in projection onto the plane of the sky",
    ", this branch may unfortunately have been superposed on top of a weak but broad coronal mass ejection .",
    "because of this interference , the tail s exact contours are hard to establish , but the syndyname seems to be again involved with the feature .",
    "the blob terminates just before crossing the synchrone for a release time of 0.1 day before perihelion .",
    "again , there is no tail in the areas corresponding to release times near perihelion .",
    "neither of the two branches becomes obvious in any postperihelion image taken with the cor1 coronagraph of the stereo - a spacecraft .    in a long series of images taken with the cor1 and cor2 coronagraphs on board the stereo - b spacecraft during much of the first day after perihelion ,",
    "the look of the comet with its tail is downright bizarre .",
    "in fact , hours before the comet s head emerged from behind the occulting disk to the west - southwest , a second branch of the tail began to show up as a steadily growing sharp spike to the northeast of the sun , joining the southwestern branch that had thrived since preperihelion times .",
    "in addition , the comet s head , after it emerged , was , just as in fig .  9 , disconnected from either of the two branches of the tail .",
    "overall , therefore , the comet again consisted of three discrete components , as seen in fig .",
    "the displayed image was taken with the cor2 coronagraph on december 16.517 ut , or 0.505 day after perihelion .",
    "the syndyname provides an excellent fit to both branches of the tail simultaneously , although the syndynames are again fairly `` crowded '' along much of the tail .",
    "this image shows that the northeastern branch extends to a point that is populated by dust released @xmath00.1 day before perihelion , in agreement with the result from fig .",
    "careful inspection of the comet s head reveals its elongation similar to that detected in the stereo - a image .    to extract information on the dust particles that populate the tail , we have examined more closely the orbital properties of dust particles along the syndyname with the help of table 7 , which lists their perihelion distance , the eccentricity , and the perihelion time as a function of @xmath22 and the time of release from the comet .",
    "the numbers along this syndyname in figs .",
    "810 are the times of release in days from the comet s perihelion time . while it is rather clear that the bright branch of the tail to the south - southeast in fig .",
    "8 is identical with the fairly pale southeastern branch in fig .  9 and with the gleaming southwestern branch in fig .  10 , the reason for the enormous differences in brightness is not obvious .",
    "the orbital elements of the dust particles in table 7 allow one to calculate the geometry for the times of the three images and to find out that the culprit is forward scattering of sunlight .",
    "for example , the particles in the bright portion of the tail in fig .  8 , located on the syndyname and released 2 days before perihelion , were at the time of observation nearly 7 @xmath5 from the sun and their phase angle was 113@xmath6 , while for the particles that left the nucleus 1 day before perihelion , although they were only 3.6 @xmath5 from the sun , the phase angle was 90@xmath6 and for those released 0.7 day before perihelion and located near the edge of the occulting disk , the phase angle was only 70@xmath6 , the reason why this part of the tail looks faint . for the same reason , the brightness of the tail s southeastern branch in fig .",
    "9 can not compare with that of the southwestern branch in fig .",
    "10 even though it is the same feature :  at the location of particles on the syndyname released 5 days before perihelion , in the middle of this tail , the phase angle is 55@xmath6 in fig .  9 , but 109@xmath6 in fig .  10 .",
    "it is further noted from table 7 that particles on that same syndyname that were released earlier than 2.5 days before perihelion did not reach their perihelion points until after december 16.5 ut and , at the times the images in figs .",
    "810 were taken , were still on their way toward the sun .",
    "by contrast , particles released later than 0.5 day before perihelion reached their perihelion points no later than about december 16.1 ut and were therefore in all three images already moving away from the sun .",
    "this is important because the relevant perihelion distances are very small .",
    "table 7 shows that on the syndyname this minimum distance drops from 2.37 @xmath5 for dust that left the nucleus 0.5 day before perihelion to 2.21 @xmath5 for dust that left 0.3 day before perihelion and to 1.81 @xmath5 for dust that left 0.1 day before perihelion . and , as expected , it is equal to the perihelion distance of the comet , 1.19 @xmath5 , for dust that left at perihelion . since the phase angle for particles on the syndyname released at perihelion is in fig .  8 equal to 88@xmath6 , nearly identical with the phase angle for particles released 0.7 day before perihelion ( see above ) ,",
    "the utter absence of dust from emissions at perihelion has nothing to do with particle sunlight scattering effects . and",
    "since figs .  8 - 10",
    "consistently show the absence of a tail for release times between approximately 0.1 day before perihelion and 0.1 day after perihelion , that is , for particles whose perihelion distances were always smaller than @xmath01.8 @xmath5 , the most likely explanation for this `` activity attenuation '' is the effect of sublimation of microscopic dust near the sun , as discussed in detail in the following section .",
    "probably the most diagnostic evidence for this effect is offered by the northeastern branch of the tail in fig .",
    "10 , which is made up of the dust that left the nucleus later than 2.2 days before perihelion . at the time of observation , these particles were more than 3 @xmath5 from the sun ; the phase angle reached 110@xmath6 for those at the edge of the occulting disk but dropped rapidly along the tail to 70@xmath6 about 1@xmath6 from the sun and was nearly constant around 50@xmath6 along much of the rest of it .",
    "the apparent brightening at the location of particles released @xmath00.3 day before perihelion is thus likely to reflect their increased production around that time .",
    "table 7 indicates that the dust at the edge of the occulting disk reached perihelion , at 2.7 @xmath5 from the sun , only about 0.45 day after the nucleus , while the dust at the far end of this tail s branch was nearest the sun , at merely @xmath01.8 @xmath5 , practically simultaneously with the nucleus .",
    "this means that at the time of observation all particles along the northeastern tail were already moving away from the sun .",
    "the fading and disappearance of this tail at a location populated by submicron - sized particles released @xmath00.080.1 day before perihelion and moving in highly hyperbolic orbits ( eccentricity @xmath02.3 or higher ) strongly indicate that their perihelion distance of @xmath01.8 @xmath5 is indeed the _ limit at which dust begins to sublimate profusely . _",

    "an effect that has not been accounted for in this paper is the deviation of the radiation - pressure acceleration from the @xmath215 dependence very close to the sun , as briefly mentioned in sec .",

    "the first fact decreases the magnitude of the radiation pressure relative to that from the standard inverse - square power law , while the latter one increases it .",

    "from the information presented , the process of disintegration of comet c/2011 w3 appears to have been followed for at least four days immediately after perihelion .",
    "a drop in activity around december 15.7 ut , or 0.3 day before perihelion , may have been related to sublimation of dust ( sec .",
    "11 ) and was not necessarily an early signature of the process of disintegration .",
    "on the other hand , the sudden and permanent loss of the nuclear condensation observed first between december 19.4 and 20.3 ut ( fig.1 ) was clear evidence of terminal collapse .",
    "there has been no trace of new activity detected from december 20 on , indicating that the comet s progressive fading after this date only reflected the rate of dispersal in space of the dust ejecta released during the december 1620 period of activity .",
    "it is not absolutely clear whether in this critical period of time the activity proceeded more or less continuously or was dominated by discrete outbursts other than the terminal event(s ) .",
    "either way , this activity must account for the formation of the quasi - parabolic envelope , encircling the spine tail , and also visible in its developing phase in the images from december 17 through 19 . although the particle - ejection velocities in the spine tail were much lower than in the envelope ( sec .",
    "8) , the outburst that triggered the formation of the spine tail was obviously the most devastating for the comet in that it was associated with the cataclysmic fragmentation of the entire residual mass of the nucleus .",
    "the low velocities of mostly large - sized debris may explain why to an earth - based observer the process appeared to have taken at least another two days to complete .",
    "simple calculations support this scenario .",
    "indeed , released on december 17.6 ut and expanding at @xmath020 m s@xmath3 , large dust in the coma would occupy a volume of about 6000 km , or 10@xmath11 , in diameter on december 19.4 ut , when the comet still displayed a nuclear condensation ( fig .  1 ) , and nearly 10,000 km , or 17@xmath11 , in diameter on december 20.3 ut , when the condensation was already gone .",
    "the diameter of the bright condensation in the malargue image from december 19 is in fact about 30@xmath11 , which suggests a major contribution of dust from the previous activity , while the breadth of the nascent spine tail in the malargue image from december 20 is just about the expected 17@xmath11 .",
    "the bright streamer in the december 19 image  the early appearance of the spine tail  can be traced to a distance of at least 6@xmath162 from the nucleus ; its end point indicates the radiation - pressure acceleration parameter of , that is , the presence of dust particles larger than 10 @xmath40 m in diameter , when released during the december 17.6 outburst .",

    "* there is a large number of papers with information on young s modulus , but they mostly refer to samples of zero or near - zero porosity . for the moon , pritchard & stevenson ( 2000 ) estimated that the effective young s modulus in the outer layers of the lunar lithosphere is between 5 and 10 gpa . for ordinary chondrites",
    "the topic was recently updated by kimberley & ramesh ( 2011 ) .",
    "they also provided the results of their experiments aimed at determining the elastic and mechanical properties of a particular l5 ordinary chondrite found in antarctica , showed that the outcome depends on whether the data were obtained under quasistatic or dynamic conditions , compared their results to the findings from the numerous studies of the atmospheric breakup of meteors , and emphasized that the propagation of cracks is gradual because the crack speeds are much lower than the limit defined by elastodynamic fracture theory .",
    "although kimberley & ramesh did not consider thermal stress , their conclusions are relevant , because they found that the value of the young s modulus for a particular sample with a 13 percent porosity depended on a strain rate and range of strain ; at slow rates and strains of up to 0.01 , gpa , at strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 and much higher strain rates ( appropriate in hypervelocity impact phenomena ) , gpa ; this behavior has also been observed in some brittle terrestrial materials , e.g. , ceramics ( wang & ramesh 2004 ) .",

    "they showed that even a low porosity reduces the values of the elastic parameters , including young s modulus , much more for the meteorites and the lunar samples than for terrestrial rocks . while there are fairly large differences between the individual samples , the steep drop in young s modulus @xmath259 with porosity @xmath260 is for 19 out of the 20 chondrites fitted by @xmath261 \\ ! \\;\\ ; ( { \\rm for } \\;\\,\\psi \\geq \\psi_0),\\ ] ] where and for 13 samples ( high @xmath233 group ) and for 6 samples ( low @xmath233 group ) .",

    "although by 2001 the porosity ( with values of up to 30 percent ) had already been known for more than 450 stony meteorites ( britt & consolmagno 2003 ) , information on their elastic moduli seems to be lagging behind .",
    "a variety of studies of terrestrial samples provides constraints on young s modulus of olivine",
    ". however , many measurements refer to temperatures in excess of 1000k . for example , tait ( 1992 ) used a value of 197 gpa at 1470k , while hiraga , anderson , & kohlstedt ( 1993 ) gave values of 159 , 155 , and 154 gpa at , respectively , 1373k , 1473k , and 1523k .",
    "chung ( 1970 ) measured the bulk modulus and poisson s ratio of olivine as a function of the mg / fe ratio at room temperature ( 296k ) and zero pressure . in terms of young s modulus ,",
    "his results show a systematic trend from a maximum of 198 gpa for forsterite to a minimum of 141 gpa for fayalite .",
    "an extensive study of the dependence on the temperature of the elastic properties of a single crystal of forsterite was published by suzuki , anderson , & sumino ( 1983 ) , who found that the elastic moduli increase with decreasing temperature at a rate of about 1.3 percent per 100k between 0k and 1200k . from their values of the bulk modulus and poisson s ratio ,",
    "young s modulus of forsterite comes out to be 175 gpa at 1500k and 207 gpa at 100k , an increase of 18 percent .",
    "all these numbers are fairly consistent with the highest values of young s modulus near 140 gpa measured by yomogida & matsui ( 1983 ) for the meteorites of low porosity .",
    "it therefore appears that the temperature effect is insignificant relative to the porosity effect .",
    "a detailed investigation of young s modulus variations with porosity for a variety of terrestrial materials was published by phani & sanyal ( 2005 ) , who determined that for colloidal gel derived silica the relative modulus varied as @xmath262 for porosities smaller than 0.85 .",
    "the slope of the curve is somewhat similar to that shown by yomogida & matsui ( 1983 ) for a sintered material and tuff in their fig .  8 ; it is considerably less steep than the slope for the meteorites and the lunar samples .    * coefficient of linear thermal expansion . *",
    "this coefficient is on a recently compiled `` wish '' list of 12 physical quantities of meteorites , the data on which are desired most by the scientific community ( consolmagno , britt , & opeil 2010 ) , a fact that cogently illustrates the urgent need for this practically nonexistent information .",
    "it has been known for nearly a century that the thermal expansion coefficient is generally temperature dependent and that its rate of variation in crystallic solids is , at least at relatively low temperatures , approximately proportional to that of the specific heat capacity at constant volume ( e.g. , austin 1952 ) . given that our primary interest is the temperature range from @xmath070k to @xmath0300k ,",
    "we have focused on a search for relevant sets of data on olivine - based silicates that should be as consistent with this temperature interval as possible .",
    "once available , the data on the coefficient of linear thermal expansion have been fitted to satisfy a properly scaled formula for the einstein crystal model ( e.g. , rogers 2005 ) , @xmath263^{-2},\\ ] ] where @xmath264 and @xmath84 are constants to be determined from the data .",
    "( the known fact that this equation does not _",
    "predict _ correct values of heat capacity at low temperatures is irrelevant to our using it to _ fit _ a set of @xmath232 values . )",
    "samples of a hot - pressed olivine aggregate were used by aizawa , ito , & tatsumi ( 2001 ) to measure its volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion , @xmath265 , but the temperature range was from 300k up , which makes the data , requiring much extrapolation , only marginally useful .",

    "another set of volumetric thermal expansion coefficients is found in the paper by suzuki , anderson , & sumino ( 1983 ) , already mentioned in the subsection on young s modulus .",
    "their data refer to the crystal of forsterite and cover the desired range of temperatures . a fit by eq .",

    "the fit gives @xmath232 equal to 1.53 , 5.54 , and at 100k , 200k , and 300k , respectively .",
    "the fit to the measured values is perfect for the first two temperatures , but too low by 12 percent for the third .",
    "unfortunately , most information available on the thermal expansion coefficient refers to geology of the earth s crust , volcanology , and related scientific fields ( e.g. , afonso , ranalli , & fernndez 2005 ) . as a result , one seldom finds data pertaining to low temperatures and low pressures . in addition , the effect of porosity on thermal expansion is seldom addressed , and when it is , the results and implications depend on the type of material and physical conditions ( e.g. , faivre , bellet , & dolino 2000 ; moretti et al .  2005 ; hunter & brownell 2006 ; ghabezloo & sulem 2009 ; ghabezloo 2010 ) , although generally there appears to be a tendency for the thermal expansion coefficient to increase with increasing porosity .    * poisson s ratio . * besides the elastic moduli , yomogida & matsui ( 1983 ) also measured poisson s ratio @xmath234 for the already mentioned 20 meteorites . with the exception of a single anomalous sample ( the same one that did not fit the dependence of young s modulus on porosity ) , all 19 remaining had their values of @xmath234 between 0.12 and 0.29 . in this data set",
    "there is a slight tendency for @xmath234 to decrease with increasing porosity , but the scatter is too large for a functional fit ; on the average , .    for olivine , chung ( 1970 ) found that poisson s ratio was increasing systematically with the fe / mg ratio from 0.242 for forsterite to 0.308 for fayalite .",
    "just as with the thermal expansion coefficient , the dependence of poisson s ratio on porosity for terrestrial materials appears to vary from case to case .",
    "gel derived silica , for example , has poisson s ratio nearly constant between 0.15 and 0.19 at porosities smaller than 0.6 , but it then rapidly climbs to 0.26 at porosity 0.82 ( ashkin , haber , & wachtman 1990 ; phani & sanyal 2005 ) .",
    "on the other hand , poisson s ratio of sintered iron decreases from 0.30 at zero porosity to 0.20 at porosity 0.2 ( kovik 2005 ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of poisson s ratio for forsterite is shown by suzuki , anderson , & sumino s ( 1983 ) data .",
    "the rate amounts to @xmath10.001 per 100k and can be neglected .",
    "compared to young s modulus and the thermal expansion coefficient , poisson s ratio has a relatively minor effect in computing thermal stress .    * adopting stress parameter @xmath258 for c/2011 w3 . * whereas the computed relative variations in thermal stress in the interior of comet c/2011 w3 in fig .",
    "14 suggest an enormous growth near and after perihelion , it remains unclear whether the effect is sufficient to crumble and collapse the nucleus .",
    "investigations of this kind can only be conducted in a framework of a particular comet model , with realistic estimates for the quantities that enter the stress parameter @xmath258 .",
    "the extensive discussion of young s modulus , the thermal expansion coefficient , and poisson s ratio was intended to facilitate this effort .    to anchor our efforts in the framework of a numerical - simulation construct for comet formation , evolution , and morphological makeup , we focus on lasue et al.s ( 2009 , 2011 ) work on aggregation and collisional interaction of cometesimals in the primordial solar nebula and the internal structure of cometary nuclei .",
    "their developed model is based on a homogeneity exponent determining an aggregation regime , accounts for disruptive , sticking , compaction , and sintering processes , allows comparison with observational constraints and future in situ observations , and provides predictions for the cohesive strength and the radial porosity profile of the nucleus interior . in our choice of parameters we concur with lasue et al . , who clearly prefer the layered structure of the nucleus , which is determined by the range of 0.4 to 0.6 for their homogeneity exponent and which offers the characteristic values of the porosity and cohesive strength that we use in this study .",
    "keeping in mind the complete disintegration of c/2011 w3 after perihelion , our primary interest is the temporal variation in thermal stress _ deep inside the nucleus _ , which we refer to as the _ central _ thermal stress . by this term",
    "we understand stress in the volume of the nucleus that does not include the surface layer , where the thermal stress profile is very different from that at greater depths . in fig .",
    "14 the boundary between the surface layer and the deep interior approximately coincides with the apparent minimum on the stress curve , associated with the transition of the tangential component @xmath224 from compression to tension .    the extensive areas of the surface and the adjacent , relatively shallow subsurface layer of the nucleus that are presumed to be devoid of ices , must in the proximity of perihelion suffer from even higher levels of thermal stress than the rest of the nucleus ( fig .",
    "they are primary candidates for thermal - stress damage , being probably riddled with crisscross cracks and the debris removed soon after perihelion .",
    "these areas may in fact provide for the comet s earliest postperihelion activity . we will not deal with them in this paper .    in fig .",
    "14 , a rather interesting property of the thermal stress distribution in deeper layers , say , from a depth of @xmath030 meters on , is that the magnitude of the total effect , @xmath266 is almost independent of depth , especially at perihelion and afterwards .",
    "because @xmath69 fairly rapidly converges to at the nucleus center , it is both convenient and appropriate to deal with this limit as a measure of thermal stress in our consideration of its temporal variations in absolute units  hence the reason for the term _",
    "central_.    the discussion of the quantities that make up the stress parameter @xmath258 suggests that in an effort to find their most appropriate values one will encounter considerable difficulties and uncertainties .",
    "the two most severe problems are the strong dependence of young s modulus on porosity and the thermal expansion coefficient s variation with temperature . in the former case",
    ", there is the need to extrapolate the data way outside the covered range of porosity . in the latter instance , it is troubling to find a parameter , which the thermal stress theory handles as a constant , to be so strongly temperature dependent .",
    "only the selection of a value for poisson s ratio appears to be somewhat less controversial , thanks to this quantity s relative invariability . yet , for all three quantities it is necessary to resort to other classes of objects and/or substances to approximate cometary material . also , we have no choice but to rely on a comet model to estimate the porosity in the interior . with these caveats in mind",
    "we proceed to the next step .",
    "we note that lasue et al.s ( 2011 ) aggregate model predicts a porosity close to 0.65 at large depths and near the center of a cometary aggregate regardless of whether the size distribution function of the cometesimals is gaussian or a power law .",
    "equation ( 41 ) then yields mpa from the high @xmath233 group of meteorites and mpa from the low @xmath233 group . for the coefficient of linear thermal expansion @xmath232 we have to adopt a mean value from a range of less than 1 to at least 6 or , based on suzuki , anderson , & sumino s ( 1983 ) data for a single crystal of forsterite . because of the possibility that an explosion from a reservoir of amorphous water ice at depths in excess of 40 meters was a trigger of , or a contributor to triggering , the terminal outburst ( fig .",
    "12 ) , we have chosen , which is near the mean and is also attained at 130k , the temperature of activation of the ice s exothermic process of crystallization ( e.g. , schmitt et al .",
    "because of the dearth of relevant information , we have not included any porosity correction",
    ". for poisson s ratio we have adopted , which is based primarily on the sample of meteorites and allows for an assumed modest decrease with porosity .",
    "its value has the role of a minor correction to the stress parameter , which comes out to be @xmath267 pa and 10 pa with the two values of @xmath233 .    to address the issue of whether the magnitude of thermal stress determined in this way for c/2011 w3 could lead to the crumbling and collapse of this comet s nucleus ,",
    "we have compared our results with the expected cohesive strength of a cometary aggregate provided by lasue et al.s model . specifically , we have taken approximate upper and lower limits near the homogeneity exponent of 0.5 , as presented in fig .",
    "7b of lasue et al .  (",
    "2009 ) , because they alluded to this point only in general terms in their second paper ( lasue et al .",
    "2011 ) ; the understanding the reader gets is that the introduction of a size distribution function of cometesimals had no significant effect on the cohesive strength .",
    "the resulting thermal stress curves , referring to the two adopted values of young s modulus , are plotted against time from perihelion in fig .",
    "15 . in broad terms",
    ", we conclude that thermal stress developing in the interior of the nucleus is :  ( 1 ) insufficient to disrupt the object before perihelion ; ( 2 ) comparable to the cohesive strength in the immediate proximity ( within hours ) of perihelion , thus weakening the nucleus structure ; and ( 3 ) greater than the strength of the comet after perihelion to the extent that it can no longer hold together .",
    "because of the uncertainties involved , one needs to exercise a caution and emphasize that this conclusion is model and parameter dependent",
    ". nevertheless , in the case of the thermal expansion coefficient , its chosen constant value has a tendency to suppress the degree of asymmetry of thermal stress relative to perihelion , that is , it overestimates thermal stress before perihelion and underestimates it after perihelion . as a matter of fact",
    ", this relation can be quantified :  from eq .",
    "( 43 ) it follows that a change @xmath268 in the temperature leads to the following change @xmath269 in the coefficient of linear thermal expansion : @xmath270 \\ !   \\frac{\\delta t}{t}.\\ ] ] this formula indicates that , for example , a modest temperature increase of 5k entails an increase in the relative rate of the @xmath232 coefficient  and therefore in thermal stress  of 2.4 percent at 200k , 5.3 percent at 150k , 15.5 percent at 100k , and an enormous 37 percent at 70k .",
    "this effect comes on top of the thermal stress increase that we have discussed below eq .",
    "( 35 ) , and enhances the role of thermal stress as the driving force behind the events of cascading fragmentation at large heliocentric distances , as mentioned in point ( 5 ) between eqs .",
    "( 40 ) and ( 41 ) ; it also aids the role of thermal stress in unlocking potential reservoirs of highly volatile ices in the nucleus interior .    in summary",
    ", our suspicion that the delayed response of the nucleus of c/2011 w3 to the extremely high temperatures in the proximity of perihelion was due to heating its interior and to the resulting effect of thermal stress finds support in this comprehensive analysis , which is limited only by incomplete information on cometary material  the problem that no hypothesis can avoid .",
    "if our scenario is valid at least with an order - of - magnitude accuracy , it strengthens the notion that c/2011 w3 was able to withstand thermal stresses on the order of several kpa and therefore possessed far more cohesion than necessary to avoid collapse and disintegration right at perihelion , in the inner solar corona .",
    "the place of the now defunct comet c/2011 w3 in the hierarchy of the kreutz system of sungrazers can not be pinpointed with certainty . however , within a given model of the system , the comet s evolutionary path can be traced in some detail .",
    "the exercise involves modeling and interpretation of long - term changes in ( a ) the orbital period and ( b ) the angular elements and perihelion distance . as amply explained in sec .  1 ,",
    "the first issue is addressed in terms of the tidal - assisted fragmentation of the early parent objects of c/2011 w3 in the close proximity of perihelion , while the second issue involves a sequence of fragmentation episodes of its more recent precursors far from the sun .    as an example",
    ", we elaborate on the evolutionary path of c/2011 w3 in the context of the hierarchical scenario b of the kreutz system , introduced in our recent paper ( sekanina & chodas 2007 ) . this scenario is based on the postulated identity of the spectacular sungrazer x/1106 c1 with a comet of a.d .",
    ". the true orbital period of this progenitor ( or superfragment , in the terminology used in sekanina & chodas 2004 ) was obviously 639 years .",
    "the integration of the orbit of c/2011 w3 back in time indicates ( table 4 ) that the previous return to perihelion occurred in january 1329 ( with a formal uncertainty of @xmath132 years , which for this exercise is not critical ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the 1329 orbital set is valid only in the unlikely absence of any fragmentation events involving the comet s precursors during the entire revolution about the sun . only in this hypothetical case",
    "does the true orbital period come out to be almost exactly 683 years . in order for a fragment",
    " an early parent of c/2011 w3  of comet 467 to arrive at perihelion in 1329 , its true orbital period must have been 862 years , or 223 years longer than that of the principal fragment , comet x/1106 c1 .",
    "this _ increase _ in the orbital period requires that the parent fragment of c/2011 w3 split off from the main body of comet 467 near perihelion ( say , at a heliocentric distance of 0.01 au ) with a separation velocity of @xmath02.2 m s@xmath3 essentially in the direction of the orbital motion ( table 8 of sekanina 2002a ) .",
    "when this parent fragment arrived at perihelion in 1329 , its orbital period was ( with some uncertainty due to the indirect planetary perturbations ) still 862 years .",
    "since the true orbital period of c/2011 w3 is 683 years , the necessary _ decrease _ of 179 years in the orbital period requires that a new fragment broke off from the parent fragment in 1329 , again in the immediate proximity of perihelion , with a separation velocity of @xmath03.6 m s@xmath3 essentially in the direction opposite the direction of orbital motion .",
    "separation rates of fragments corresponding to relative velocities of up to 5 or 6 m s@xmath3 are known to be necessary for explaining the tidal - assisted splitting of sungrazing comets ( sekanina & chodas 2007 ) , so the required velocities of less than 4 m s@xmath3 provide a plausible evolutionary model for comet c/2011 w3 .",
    "similar numbers would result if the adopted scenario b should be replaced with another one .    because of potential differences in the angular elements and perihelion distance between the orbits of c/2011 w3 and the new fragment referred to above , it is highly unlikely that the two objects are identical .",
    "much more probable is that the new fragment was a precursor to c/2011 w3 , which between 1329 and 2011 underwent additional , nontidal fragmentation at large heliocentric distances , and that during these episodes one of the fragments acquired the necessary orbital orientation and perihelion distance to become c/2011 w3 .",
    "if the first precursor s angular elements in the 14th century were in the range of most soho sungrazing comets , that is , close to those of c/1963 r1 , the differences relative to c/2011 w3 may have been substantial , about 35@xmath6 to 40@xmath6 in the argument of perihelion and the longitude of the ascending node , some 10@xmath6 in the inclination , and up to 10 percent of the sun s radius in the perihelion distance . to bridge the gaps of this magnitude",
    "requires several nontidal fragmentation events in the general proximity of aphelion ( at heliocentric distances of , typically , 100 au or so ) at an assumed average separation velocity of 23 m s@xmath3 , a requirement by no means excessive . a simulation model for a sequence of nontidal fragmentation events scaled for the kreutz system from the case of d/1993 f2 ( shoemaker - levy 9 ) shows that the number of these episodes can easily exceed a dozen during one revolution about the sun ( sekanina 2002a , 2002b ) .",
    "their high frequency is also obvious from the arrival rate of the soho minicomets , the high - generation products of the cascading fragmentation process , the age of each of them being manifestly shorter than one revolution about the sun ( e.g. , sekanina & chodas 2004 ) .    in the broader context of the fragmentation hierarchy of the branch of the kreutz system , which in our scenario b also contains the sungrazer c/1843 d1 ,",
    "the described evolutionary path of c/2011 w3 is depicted in fig .",
    "16 . in this more general scheme",
    ", the parent fragment may have reached perihelion years or even decades before or after 1329 , because fragmentation at large heliocentric distances entails modest changes in the orbital period of up to a few years per event ( table 8 of sekanina 2002a ) .",
    "regardless of the details of the evolution of c/2011 w3 , its origin appears to be linked to the expected new , 21st century cluster of bright sungrazers .",
    "what remains unclear is its subgroup membership . while already kreutz ( 1901 ) was thinking in terms of two subgroups when investigating historical sungrazers , this division for the bright members of the kreutz system became a hit after marsden s ( 1967 ) publication of his classical paper , which listed c/1843 d1 , c/1880 c1 , and c/1963 r1 as the definite members of subgroup i , while c/1882 r1 , c/1945 x1 , and c/1965 s1 belonged to subgroup ii .",
    "in addition , marsden tabulated four and two additional comets , respectively , as possible members of the two categories .",
    "a dent in this classification scheme was made by c/1970 k1 , whose orbit did not fit either subgroup . because its orbit was closer to subgroup ii , marsden ( 1989 ) classified it subsequently as subgroup iia .",
    "now comes c/2011 w3 , whose perihelion distance fits subgroup i , but the angular elements are incompatible with any of the subgroups i , ii , or iia .",
    "this is worrisome , because marsden ( 1967 ) regarded the longitude of the nodal line , one of the orbital angles , as the prime classifier for the subgroups .",
    "if one considers , by extension , c/2011 w3 to be a representative of a new subgroup iii , one ends up with a total of eight bright sungrazers distributed into four categories , or two members per subgroup on the average , not to mention that the orbit of c/1945 x1 , one of the eight , is not really all that well fixed ( see marsden 1989 and our comment about cunningham s computations in sec .",
    "an overwhelming majority of soho , smm , and solwind sungrazers belongs to subgroup i. this was shown to be the case by marsden ( 1989 ) for the smm and solwind comets and is illustrated for 1565 soho sungrazers in a plot of the longitude of the ascending node against the orbit inclination in fig .",
    "however , nearly 100 soho sungrazers , or about 6 percent of the total , make up a second branch , which in the range of ascending node longitudes from @xmath0320@xmath6 to at least @xmath0345@xmath6 lies about 6@xmath6 below an extended arm of the subgroup i set .",
    "and some 4@xmath6 to 5@xmath6 below this second branch there is yet another cluster of nearly 30 soho sungrazers with their nodal longitudes between 310@xmath6 and 335@xmath6 .    for the sake of comparison , we have also included four bright sungrazers in fig .",
    "d1 , of subgroup i , is right in the dense core of the soho sungrazers , while c/1965 s1 ( of subgroup ii ) , c/1970 k1 ( of subgroup iia ) , and c/2011 w3 are all located off the main branch . a surprising finding is that the second , much less populated but still well defined branch of the soho sungrazers belongs to subgroup iia ( not ii , as has generally been assumed ) .",
    "there is practically no concentration at all of the soho objects near the location of c/1965 s1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the agreement between the positions of c/2011 w3 and a third , very sparsely populated branch is rather obvious .",
    "thus , when it comes to the soho sungrazers , the orientation of the orbit of c/2011 w3 in space is certainly not unique . and while the three branches essentially merge into a common relation in the plot of the longitude of the ascending node against the argument of perihelion in fig .",
    "18 , c/2011 w3 is again surrounded by a number of soho sungrazers .    on the whole ,",
    "the classification of the bright sungrazers into the subgroups is somewhat questionable . a suggestion for its eventual abandonment",
    "is supported by our finding ( sekanina & chodas 2007 ) that even following a single fragmentation event at large heliocentric distance , two fragments of the same parent can end up in orbits formally belonging to different subgroups .",
    "in fact , the progenitor s splitting far from the sun into two superfragments with widely different orbits is a prerequisite behind the idea of introducing the concept of subgroups in the first place ( sekanina & chodas 2004 ) .",
    "the point of contention with c/2011 w3 is thus not whether it could derive from a precursor belonging to another subgroup , but , rather , that no plausible candidate for a sungrazing comet was ever recorded in the first half of the 14th century .",
    "hasegawa & nakano ( 2001 ) considered only one _ possible _ sungrazer , x/1381 v1 , during the entire 14th century .",
    "all three comets between 1282 and 1368 in england s ( 2002 ) list have a relatively low sungrazer ranking , even though the author does not entirely exclude the possibility for each of them , including one seen in europe in october 1314 , to be a member of the kreutz system .    on the other hand , only if the cumulative effect in the orbital period from a number of fragmentation episodes at large heliocentric distances could , in an extreme and quite unlikely run of events , amount to as much as @xmath050 years , could x/1381 v1 have been a parent to c/2011 w3 in the sense that one of the products of its tidal - assisted breakup in 1381 would have become the first precursor to c/2011 w3 .",
    "of course , a large number of comets recorded in the late 13th century and during the 14th century were cataloged by ho ( 1962 ) , by hasegawa ( 1980 ) , and by kronk ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , most of them fail to fit a kreutz sungrazer because of the time of the year , the location in the sky , the apparent motion , or the appearance , while for the rest of them the reported information is too vague for the identification .",
    "the future modeling of the kreutz - system evolution should proceed with these circumstances taken into account .",
    "the issues and results presented in this investigation are summarized into the following conclusions :    \\(1 ) having survived the perihelion passage , comet c/2011 w3 was observed to undergo major morphological changes , culminating in the permanent loss of the nuclear condensation between 2011 december 19.4 and 20.3 ut , some 4 days after perihelion .",
    "\\(2 ) this transformation was accompanied by a parallel development of a narrow , rectilinear dust streamer , extending essentially along the tail s axis in the images of december 19 and rapidly evolving , in less than 24 hours , into a ribbon - like spine tail .",
    "\\(3 ) from the temporal variations in the projected orientation of its axis between december 19 and january 18 , we find that this spine tail was a synchronic feature , whose brightest part consisted of submillimeter - sized dust grains released at velocities not exceeding 30 m s@xmath3 and whose origin was an outburst or a terminal ( cataclysmic ) fragmentation event ( possibly even a rapid sequence of such very brief episodes ) , which peaked on december ut .",
    "\\(4 ) accordingly , the comet s postperihelion activity , which lasted less than 48 hours and resulted in releasing up to an estimated 10@xmath2 grams of dust ( equivalent to a sphere 150 - 200 meters across ) , was the sole source of the spectacular dust tail , which was observed for 3 months , until mid - march .",
    "\\(5 ) the delayed response of c/2011 w3 to the extremely adverse environment in the close proximity of the sun , which the nucleus disintegration must have signified , is of utmost importance .",
    "this overdue reaction speaks volumes about the cohesion of the nucleus and provides a clue to the probable nature of the breakup mechanism  as a product of a gradual heat pulse penetration to great depths of the nucleus and an entailing steady buildup of thermal stress throughout the interior .",
    "\\(6 ) modeling of the heat - transfer process and the thermal stress distribution inside the nucleus , whose dimensions diminish with time because of continuing erosion at the surface , shows that the rate of propagation of the heat pulse around perihelion was extremely rapid and highly asymmetric in that at greater depths beneath the surface both temperature and thermal stress were much higher at the same heliocentric distance after than before perihelion and continued to grow far from the sun , on the way to aphelion .",
    "\\(7 ) based on the elastic constants for meteoritic , lunar , and some terrestrial analogs , the magnitude of thermal stress throughout much of the nucleus is estimated at more than 10 kpa shortly after perihelion , overcoming the object s expected cohesive strength ( on the order of several kpa according to lasue et al.s aggregate model ) , riddling the entire interior with a dense network of clefts and cracks , thus causing eventually the nucleus collapse into a cloud of debris .",
    "\\(9 ) on the other hand , survival in the solar corona and the delayed response to the adverse conditions in its environment is inconsistent with the model of a strengthless or poorly cemented rubble - pile nucleus made up essentially of unconsolidated debris .",
    "\\(10 ) if there were isolated reservoirs of volatile ices deep in the interior of the nucleus , major cracks caused by excess thermal stress would have opened them to the propagating heat wave , with the ensuing explosion contributing to the destruction of the nucleus ; our model predicts that 1.6 days after perihelion , pockets of amorphous water ice more than 40 meters beneath the surface would have been exposed to a temperature of @xmath0130k and thereby an exothermic reaction would be triggered , associated with amorphous ice s crystallization ; only data on temporal variations in the comet s production of water vapor and/or other gas species could settle this issue .",
    "\\(11 ) the disappearance of the nuclear condensation deprived observers of obtaining postperihelion astrometry needed for an accurate orbit computation by traditional techniques , so that the orbital period of c/2011 w3 remained essentially indeterminate even at the time of termination of observations .",
    "\\(12 ) we argue that the missing nucleus must have been located on the synchrone defined by the axis of the spine tail whose orientation and sunward tip have been measured ; the missing nucleus also must have been situated on the line of forced orbital - period variation , computed from the orbital solutions based on high - quality preperihelion astrometry from the ground .",
    "\\(13 ) we succeed in deriving the astrometric positions of this missing nucleus as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the spine tail s synchrone and the line of orbital - period variation ; a high - quality orbital solution is obtained by linking the preperihelion observations with these derived positions of the missing nucleus .",
    "\\(14 ) the resulting orbit gives years for the osculating orbital period and confirms that c/2011 w3 is the first major member of the expected new , 21st century cluster of bright kreutz - system sungrazers , whose existence was predicted by these authors in 2007 .",
    "\\(15 ) from the spine - tail evolution we determine that the measured sunward tip receded antisunward from the computed position of the missing nucleus , the distance increasing from 1@xmath162 on december 23 to more than 10@xmath162 in mid - january and that this terminus was populated by dust particles 1 - 2 mm in diameter .",
    "\\(16 ) the bizarre appearance of the comet s dust tail in images taken with the coronagraphs on board the soho and stereo spacecraft only hours after perihelion is modeled , using the standard dynamical method , in terms of the ratio @xmath22 of the acceleration by solar radiation pressure to that by the solar gravitational attraction ; the tail brightness was affected by forward scattering of sunlight by dust to a considerable degree .",
    "\\(17 ) modeling of the soho s c3 preperihelion images of the dust tail shows a population of predominantly microscopic particles with a broad range of sizes and composition , described both by ( strongly absorbing , such as carbon - rich , grains moving in convex hyperbolic orbits ) and by ( essentially dielectric , perhaps mostly silicate , grains in concave hyperbolic orbits ) ; the ones that were still imaged after perihelion had , probably submicron - sized silicate particles .",
    "\\(18 ) by contrast , nearly all microscopic dust released before perihelion into convex hyperbolic orbits moved almost immediately away from the sun and was not seen in the postperihelion images of the comet .",
    "\\(19 ) the disconnection of the comet s head from the dust tail released before perihelion , strikingly depicted in the postperihelion images taken with the soho s c2 coronagraph and with the coronagraphs on board stereo - a and stereo - b , is interpreted as a result of vigorous sublimation of submicron - sized dust at heliocentric distances smaller than about 1.8 @xmath5 , primarily particles with released between 0.1 day before and 0.1 day after perihelion .",
    "\\(20 ) from the integrated effect of dust particle sublimation , we establish the relationship between the sublimation - pressure constant @xmath193 and the heat of sublimation @xmath194 and find that it is consistent with the @xmath271 relation for mg - rich olivine and that therefore it is likely that the dust sublimating very close to the sun is dominated by olivine - based silicates , a conclusion that is also supported dynamically by the magnitude of the acceleration parameter @xmath22 .",
    "\\(21 ) the place of c/2011 w3 in the hierarchy of the kreutz system of sungrazing comets is a matter of some speculation , but one possible evolutionary path is charted , based on our orbit integration back to the comet s previous return to perihelion , which nominally occurred in 1329 .",
    "\\(22 ) in the context of scenario b of the kreutz system s hierarchy ( from our 2007 paper ) we follow the tidal - assisted breakup of the progenitor ( or superfragment )  the comet of 467  and the expected chain of nontidal fragmentation events into a number of parent fragments ( including x/1106 c1 ) ; a subsequent tidal - assisted splitting of one such parent fragment in the 14th century into another generation of fragments , including the first precursor of c/2011 w3 ; and , finally , another bout of nontidal cascading fragmentation with the birth of comet c/2011 w3 as a discrete object of its own .",
    "\\(23 ) in this scenario , c/2011 w3 is indirectly related to x/1106 c1 and c/1843 d1 , and in the coming years and decades it may be followed by more equally bright or brighter sungrazing comets in similar orbits .",
    "\\(24 ) comet c/2011 w3 presents a complication for the classification of the bright sungrazers into subgroups :  its perihelion distance is typical for subgroup i , but its angular elements do not fit any of the subgroups i , ii , or iia ; thus , among the bright members of the kreutz system , the orbit of c/2011 w3 is unique , although we are not ready to call it a representative of a new subgroup .",
    "\\(25 ) in a plot of the longitude of the ascending node against the inclination , c/2011 w3 is associated with the least populated of the three branches into which the soho sungrazers discriminate ; from this standpoint , its orbit is not unique .",
    "\\(26 ) because the orbits of the sungrazers ( including the bright objects ) can be transformed by the cascading fragmentation process from one subgroup into another subgroup during one revolution about the sun , the classification of the bright sungrazers into subgroups may no longer be appropriate .",
    "\\(27 ) future modeling of the hierarchy and evolution of the kreutz system of sungrazers should account for the existence of c/2011 w3 and its apparent relationship with the minor branch of soho sungrazers ; at a minimum , orbital computations should verify the degree of plausibility of a fragmentation path of the type displayed in fig .",
