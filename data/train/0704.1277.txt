    "a quantum state can not be squeezed down to a point in phase space .",
    "but there are quantum states that closely approximate classical states , such as the coherent states of a harmonic oscillator",
    ". one characterization of the coherent states is based on the wigner function : they are the only states for which the wigner function is both strictly positive and rotationally symmetric around its center ( here we assume a specific scaling of the axes appropriate for the given oscillator )",
    ".    one can also express the quantum mechanics of _ discrete _ systems in terms of phase space . in this paper",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 qubits described in the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the discrete phase space can be pictured as a @xmath2 array of points . in this framework , the discrete wigner function preserves the tomographic feature of the usual wigner function , but the points of the discrete phase space are defined abstractly and do not come with an immediate physical interpretation . as in the continuous case",
    ", a point in discrete phase space is _ illegal _ as a quantum state : it holds too much information .",
    "but one can ask whether there are quantum states that , like coherent states , approximate a phase - space point as closely as possible .",
    "we would like to identify such states and thereby to give more physical meaning to the discrete phase space . in this paper",
    "we focus primarily on the second of the two properties mentioned above : invariance under rotations .",
    "we will see that one can make sense of this notion in the discrete space and that rotationally invariant states exist for any number of qubits .",
    "the most interesting property of these states is that they minimize uncertainty in a well defined sense .",
    "the product @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are position and momentum , has no meaning in our setting because our variables have no natural ordering .",
    "we therefore express uncertainty in information - theoretic terms , specifically in terms of the rnyi entropy of order 2 ( which we call simply  rnyi entropy \" for short ) .",
    "moreover we consider not just the `` axis variables , '' but also variables associated with all the other directions in the discrete phase space .",
    "( in the continuous case these other directions would be associated with linear combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . )",
    "we will find that _ each _ rotationally invariant state minimizes the rnyi entropy , averaged over all these variables .",
    "this will leave us with the question of picking out a  most pointlike \" of the rotationally invariant states , if such a notion can be made meaningful ; we address this question briefly in the conclusion .",
    "over the years there have been many proposals for generalizing the wigner function to discrete systems .",
    "( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and papers cited in ref .",
    "here we adopt the discrete wigner function proposed by gibbons _",
    "@xcite , which is well suited to a system of qubits .",
    "the basic idea is to use , instead of the field of real numbers in which position and momentum normally take their values , a _ finite _ field with a number of elements equal to the dimension @xmath6 of the state space .",
    "there exists a field with @xmath6 elements if and only if @xmath6 is a power of a prime ; so this approach applies directly only to quantum systems , such as a collection of qubits , whose state - space dimension is such a number .",
    "the two - element field @xmath7 is simply the set @xmath8 with addition and multiplication mod 2 , but the field of order @xmath9 with @xmath0 larger than 1 is different from arithmetic mod @xmath9 .",
    "for example , @xmath10 consists of the elements @xmath11 , in which @xmath12 and @xmath13 act as in @xmath7 and arithmetic involving the abstract symbol @xmath14 is determined by the equation @xmath15 .",
    "the discrete phase space for a system of @xmath0 qubits is a two - dimensional vector space over @xmath1 ; that is , a point in the phase space can be expressed as @xmath16 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the discrete analogues of position and momentum , take values in @xmath1 . in this phase space it makes perfect sense to speak of lines and parallel lines ; a line , for example , is the solution to a linear equation . the key idea in constructing a wigner function is to assign a pure quantum state , represented by a one - dimensional projection operator @xmath17 , to each line @xmath18 in phase space .",
    "the only requirement imposed on the function @xmath17 is that it be  translationally covariant . \"",
    "this means that if we translate the line @xmath18 in phase space by adding a fixed vector @xmath16 to each point , the associated quantum state changes by a unitary operator @xmath19 associated with @xmath16 .",
    "the unitary translation operator @xmath19 is defined to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are pauli operators and @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are elements of @xmath7 , are components of @xmath4 and @xmath5 when they are expanded in particular `` bases '' for the field : e.g. , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the basis chosen for the coordinate @xmath4 . and @xmath5 can not be chosen independently : each must be proportional to the _ dual _ of the other@xcite .",
    "] one finds that the requirement of translational covariance severely constrains the construction :    1 .",
    "states assigned to parallel lines must be orthogonal . a complete set of parallel lines , or `` striation ,",
    "'' consists of exactly @xmath6 lines ; so the states associated with a given striation constitute a complete orthogonal basis for the state space .",
    "in other words , each striation is associated with a complete orthogonal measurement on the system .",
    "2 .   the bases associated with different striations must be _ mutually unbiased_. that is , each element of one basis is an equal - magnitude superposition of the elements of any of the other bases .",
    "there are exactly @xmath27 striations , so this construction generates a set of @xmath27 mutually unbiased bases .",
    "( such a set is just sufficient for the complete tomographic reconstruction of an unknown quantum state . )    despite these constraints , there are many allowed functions @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that there are many possible definitions of the wigner function for a system of qubits , because once we have chosen a particular assignment of quantum states to phase - space lines , the wigner function of any quantum state is uniquely fixed by the requirement that the sums over the lines of any striation be equal to the probabilities of the outcomes of the corresponding measurement .",
    "in the finite field , consider a quadratic polynomial @xmath28 that has no roots .",
    "then the equation @xmath29 with @xmath30 taking all nonzero values in @xmath1 , defines what we will call a set of `` circles '' centered at the origin .",
    "fixing the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32this is somewhat analogous to fixing the scales of the axes in the continuous case  we define a _",
    "rotation _ to be any linear transformation of the phase space that leaves each circle invariant .",
    "( we consider only rotations around the origin . a state centered at the origin",
    "can always be translated to another point by @xmath19 . ) for example , in the two - qubit phase space , our circles can be defined by the equation @xmath33 and an example of a rotation is the transformation @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 one can check that this particular rotation has the property that if we apply it repeatedly , starting with any nonzero vector , it generates the entire circle on which that vector lies . in this sense @xmath34 is a _ primitive _ rotation .    with every unit - determinant linear transformation @xmath36 on the phase space ,",
    "one can associate ( though not uniquely ) a unitary transformation @xmath37 on the state space whose action by conjugation on the translation operators @xmath19 mimics the action of @xmath36 on the corresponding points of phase space@xcite .",
    "is proved in ref .",
    "one can show that every rotation has unit determinant and must therefore have an associated unitary transformation .",
    "for example , for the rotation @xmath34 given above , if we expand both @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the field basis @xmath38 , the following unitary transformation acts in the desired way on the translation operators : @xmath39 thus just as @xmath40 we have that @xmath41    for any number @xmath0 of qubits , let @xmath34 be a primitive rotation , and let @xmath37 be a unitary transformation associated with @xmath34 in the above sense .",
    "( techniques for finding @xmath37 can be found in refs .",
    "then from the action of @xmath37 on the translation operators , it follows that @xmath37 acts in a particularly simple way on the mutually unbiased bases associated with the striations of phase space : starting with any one of these bases , repeated applications of @xmath37 generate all the other bases cyclically . that there always exists a unitary @xmath37 generating a complete set of mutually unbiased bases for @xmath0 qubits",
    "has been shown by chau @xcite . in our present context",
    ", we will reach the same conclusion by showing , in the following paragraph , that there always exists a primitive rotation .",
    "the existence of such a unitary matrix @xmath37 leads naturally to a simple prescription for choosing the function @xmath17 : ( i ) use the translation operators to assign computational basis states to the vertical lines .",
    "( ii ) apply @xmath37 repeatedly to these states , and @xmath34 repeatedly to the lines , in order to complete the correspondence .",
    "this prescription results in a definition of the wigner function that is `` rotationally covariant , '' in the sense that when one transforms the density matrix by @xmath37 , the values of the wigner function are permuted among the phase - space points according to  @xmath34 .",
    "how does one find a primitive rotation @xmath34 ?",
    "first , for any number of qubits , there always exists a _",
    "primitive _ polynomial of the form @xmath42 @xcite , which one can use to define circles by the equation @xmath43 .",
    "then the linear transformation @xmath44 is guaranteed to cycle through all the nonzero points of phase space @xcite , and it always takes circles to other circles .",
    "raising @xmath36 to the power @xmath45 gives us a unit - determinant transformation that preserves circles and is indeed a primitive rotation .",
    "moreover , one can write @xmath34 explicitly in terms of @xmath32 : @xmath46    with @xmath17 chosen in the way we have prescribed , the eigenstates of @xmath37 are our rotationally invariant states . when we apply @xmath37 to _ any _ state , the wigner function simply flows along the circles in accordance with the rotation @xmath34 .",
    "but an eigenstate of @xmath37 does not change under this action , so its wigner function must be constant on each circle .",
    "consider again our complete set of @xmath27 mutually unbiased bases , and let @xmath47 be the @xmath48th vector in the @xmath49th basis .",
    "these vectors together have the following remarkable property : for any pure state @xmath50 , the probabilities @xmath51 satisfy @xcite @xmath52 now consider the rnyi entropy @xmath53 of the outcome - probabilities of the @xmath49th measurement when applied to the state @xmath50 .",
    "this entropy is a measure of our inability to predict the outcome of the measurement .",
    "the _ average _ of @xmath54 over all the mutually unbiased measurements can be bounded from below @xcite : @xmath55 \\geq -\\log_2\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{d+1}\\right)\\sum_{ij } p_{ij}^2\\right ] = \\log_2(d+1 ) - 1 , \\label{ineq}\\ ] ] with equality holding only if the rnyi entropy is _ constant _ over all the mutually unbiased measurements .",
    "now , for any of the rotationally invariant states defined in the last section , the rnyi entropies associated with the @xmath27 mutually unbiased measurements are indeed equal . by the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) , such states therefore minimize the average rnyi entropy over all these measurements , that is , over all the directions in phase space .",
    "the one - qubit case is very simple .",
    "the three mutually unbiased bases generated in our construction are the eigenstates of the pauli operators @xmath21 , @xmath56 , and @xmath22 .",
    "it is not hard to find a unitary transformation that cycles through these three bases .",
    "such a transformation rotates the bloch sphere by @xmath57 around the axis @xmath58 .",
    "the two eigenstates of this unitary transformation , which are the eigenstates of @xmath59 , are rotationally invariant : each of their wigner functions is constant on the only circle in the @xmath60 phase space . and",
    "each of these states minimizes the average rnyi entropy for the measurements @xmath21 , @xmath56 , and @xmath22 .",
    "it is interesting to note that one of these two states has a positive wigner function .",
    "clearly there is nothing intrinsically special about these two states .",
    "they are special only in relation to the three measurements @xmath21 , @xmath56 , and @xmath22 , which are associated with the three striations of the phase space .",
    "but in the context of quantum cryptography , the entropy - minimization property is quite relevant . in the six - state scheme ( in which the signal states are the eigenstates of @xmath21 , @xmath56 , and @xmath22 ) ,",
    "if eve chooses to eavesdrop by making a complete measurement on certain photons , her best choice is to make a measurement whose outcome - states are entropy - minimizing in our sense : it turns out that such a choice minimizes eve s own rnyi entropy about alice s bit .",
    "an interesting example comes from the 3-qubit case .",
    "the relevant field is @xmath61 , which can be constructed from @xmath7 by introducing an element @xmath32 that is defined to satisfy the equation @xmath62 . in our @xmath63 discrete phase space",
    ", we can define circles via the equation @xmath64 where @xmath30 can take any nonzero value .",
    "a primitive rotation preserving these circles is ) is not of the form we used in reaching eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , in that it is not based on a primitive polynomial , the matrix @xmath34 is nevertheless a primitive rotation . ]",
    "@xmath65    one finds that of the eight eigenvectors of any unitary @xmath37 corresponding to @xmath34 , all of which are rotationally invariant , exactly one has a positive wigner function for a specific , fixed function @xmath17 associated with @xmath37 .",
    "this state is also easy to describe physically . for a particular choice of @xmath37",
    ", it is of the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the two eigenstates ( with a specific relative phase ) of the operator @xmath59 .",
    "if we regard @xmath50 as analogous to a coherent state at the origin , then the coherent - like states at the 63 other phase - space points can be obtained from @xmath50 by applying pauli rotations to the individual qubits .",
    "the wigner function of each of these states has the value 0.319 at its center , the largest value possible for any three - qubit state .",
    "we have found that one can make sense of the notion of rotational invariance in a discrete phase space for a system of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "the rotationally invariant states are in this respect analogous to the energy eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator , but the analogy is not perfect .",
    "our rotationally invariant states are all states of minimum uncertainty with respect to the various directions in phase space , whereas except for the ground state , the harmonic oscillator eigenstates do not have this property ( the uncertainty , even in our rnyi sense , increases with increasing energy ) .",
    "we have considered the further restriction to positive wigner functions but so far have found examples of such states only for a single qubit and for three qubits .",
    "however , for any number of qubits , one can show that at least one of our rotationally invariant states takes a value at its center equal to the maximum value attainable by the wigner function of _ any _ state .",
    "perhaps this latter property , rather than positivity , should be taken as the defining feature of a  most pointlike \" state ."
