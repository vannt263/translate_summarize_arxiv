    "the front form provides a rigorous relativistic many - body theory that has been applied , e.g. , to investigate nuclear matter  @xcite . therefore it is quite natural to ask for the merits of light - front quantization in the context of quantum statistics to describe many - particle systems of finite temperature @xmath0 and finite chemical potential @xmath1 .",
