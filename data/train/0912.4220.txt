    "bianchi cosmological models are homogeneous solutions of efe .",
    "these models generalize frw model , although they are homogeneous , as frw one , generally they are anisotropic .",
    "standard cosmological model has survived almost all observational tests @xcite , however bianchi cosmologies havent been discarded .",
    "today the universe is highly isotropic , but in early times it could nt been so , and it is an open question how anisotropies died .",
    "standard model fails to explain quadrupole anomaly @xcite , obtained from cosmic microwave background data .",
    "this anomaly have a plausible explanation with bianchi models , for that reason these models are considered today @xcite .",
    "thus we considered the idea of studying geodesic deviation equation(gde ) in some of these models .",
    "we assume a fluid description for the cosmological model .",
    "the 4-velocity @xmath0 of preferred worldlines is normalized , @xmath1 .",
    "given this 4-velocity , we define the projection tensor @xmath2 , the expansion scalar @xmath3 , the shear @xmath4 and the vorticity @xmath5 @xcite , @xcite . in frw case @xmath6 .",
    "these quantities are related with weyl tensor . in frw case weyl tensor",
    "is zero , so it is conformally flat , but it is not the case in bianchi models . in the @xmath7 covariant description we can split the weyl tensor into an electric @xmath8 and a magnetic part @xmath9 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in a space - time torsion free , if @xmath10 is the normalized tangent vector field of a fiducial geodesic , parameterized by an affine parameter @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , with @xmath13 if the geodesics are spacelike , null or timelike respectively ; if @xmath14 is the deviation vector for the congruence , then the evolution of the separation or the deviation vector @xmath14 evolves according to gde @xcite :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the covariant derivative along the geodesic .",
    "+ now , let s see",
    "how is this equation in bianchi type i model , given by the metric@xcite , @xcite :    @xmath17    if we define @xmath18 , from the energy - momentum tensor conservation we get an analogous expression to a known friedmann equation @xcite , @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the energy density and @xmath21 is the pressure . as we see in the gde , there is a difference if space - time has a nonzero weyl tensor .",
    "ellis and van elst in @xcite consider this equation for frw space - time .",
    "+ for bianchi type i model vorticity and magnetic part of weyl tensor are equal to zero , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the electric and shear tensors are non - null and diagonal . for that reason ,",
    "if we define @xmath24 and @xmath25 , if we suppose a perfect fluid , @xmath26 , @xmath27 we have that gde for this space is :    @xmath28\\eta^{\\alpha}\\\\ + f(2u^{\\alpha}+\\eta^{\\alpha}-v^{\\alpha})+e^{\\alpha}_{\\gamma}\\eta^{\\gamma}(\\varepsilon+2e^{2 } ) \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the cosmological constant .",
    "the first part of this expression is the force term representing the perfect part of the fluid @xcite and only gives isotropic deviation . in frw case",
    "we only have this term and reflects spatial isotropy of space - time , deviation vector only changes in magnitude but not in direction .",
    "the other terms change the direction of @xmath14 .",
    "+ if we suppose an equation of state @xmath30 , ( @xmath31 for dust , @xmath32 for radiation ) , then , for @xmath33 we get@xcite :    @xmath34    given @xmath35 as a function of t we can get @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the electric weyl tensor tends to zero .",
    "it is diagonal and its components decay . for this model",
    "the vorticity and the magnetic part of weyl tensor are null .",
    "the efe imply that @xmath26 .",
    "this means we have a fluid without viscosity .",
    "however , we can have an imperfect fluid because the model allows to have an anisotropic pressure @xmath39 .",
    "but this anisotropic pressure tensor must be diagonal , following efe s . given @xmath35 as a function of @xmath40 we have expressions for @xmath41 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the evolution of the three scale factors for @xmath31 is shown in figure 1 and for @xmath32 in figure 2 .",
    "we can see that in radiation case anisotropy is greater than in matter dominated case , but in both cases anisotropy dies . + the @xmath42 scalar defined by @xmath43 also measure the degree of anisotropy in the model . in figure 4",
    "we illustrate the evolution of @xmath44 .",
    "the evolution of the electric weyl tensor show us that this model tends to isotropy as t grows , the model isotropizes .",
    "also the evolution of shear scalar . in frw only the magnitude @xmath45 will change along a geodesic , while its spatial orientation remain fixed @xcite .",
    "so , in early times the deviation is anisotropic , the orientation is important , for example , along the z axis deviation will grow , while along x and y axis the effect of weyl tensor is to contract the deviation , because there are the other terms that are also present in frw .",
    "here we considered a perfect fluid , @xmath27 .",
    "along x axis , the effect of anisotropy is minimal .",
