    "graphene is a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms that has attracted considerable attention recently because of experimental progress@xcite that has raised hopes for applications in nanoelectronics and because of exotic chiral features@xcite in its electronic structure . in the absence of spin - orbit interactions ,",
    "the energy bands of graphene are described at low energies by a two - dimensional dirac equation with linear dispersion centered on the hexagonal corners of the honeycomb lattice brillouin zone .",
    "the recent advances in fabrication techniques have made it possible to produce graphitic systems with only a few layers or even a single monolayer of graphene@xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of graphene is its half integer quantum hall effect , confirmed by recent experiments@xcite .",
    "this electronic property follows directly from the system s dirac - like band structure@xcite . in a recent paper , kane and",
    "mele@xcite showed that symmetry allowed spin - orbit interactions can generate an energy gap and convert graphene from a two dimensional zero gap semiconductor to an insulator with a quantized spin hall effect@xcite .",
    "the quantized spin hall conductivity can be zero or nonzero , depending on the relative strength of intrinsic and rashba spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the temperature at which the spin hall effect can be observed , and the sample quality requirements for its occurrence , depend on the absolute magnitude of these two spin - orbit interaction terms in the band structure .",
    "( kane and mele@xcite argued on the basis of rough estimates of the spin - orbit interaction scale , that the quantum spin hall effect in graphene should be observable at relatively accessible temperatures of the order of 1@xmath3 . )",
    "motivated by the fundamental interest associated with the spin hall effect and spin - orbit interactions in graphene , we have attempted to estimate , on the basis of microscopic considerations , the strength of both interactions .    in order to allow for a rashba interaction ,",
    "we account for the presence of an external gate electric field @xmath1 of the type used experimentally in graphene to move the fermi energy away from the dirac point .",
    "( importantly this electric field explicitly removes inversion through the graphene plane from the symmetry operations of the system . ) then , starting from a microscopic tight - binding model with atomic spin - orbit interactions of strength @xmath0 , we use perturbation theory to derive expressions for the spin - orbit coupling terms that appear in the low - energy hamiltonian . at",
    "leading order in @xmath0 only the rashba spin - orbit interaction term ( @xmath4 ) appears .",
    "the intrinsic ( @xmath2 ) spin - orbit coupling has a leading contribution proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "both terms have the form proposed by kane and mele@xcite on the basis of symmetry considerations . according to our theory",
    "the respective coupling constants are given by the following expressions : @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are tight - binding model parameters explained more fully below , @xmath1 is a perpendicular external electric field , and @xmath10 is proportional to the atomic size of carbon .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 have numerical values @xmath13 times smaller and @xmath13 times larger , respectively , than the estimates of kane and mele@xcite with @xmath14 at the largest reasonable values of @xmath1 . together , these estimates suggest that the quantum spin hall effect will be observable in ideal samples only at temperatures below @xmath15 in a zero - field limit .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : tight_binding ] we briefly summarize the tight - binding model used to represent graphene in this paper .",
    "section [ sec : perturbation ] describes some details of the perturbation theory calculation . in section [ sec : abinitio ] we discuss _ ab initio _ density functional theory calculations we have carried out as a partial check on the tight - binding model and on the atomic approximation for spin - orbit interactions used in the perturbation theory calculations .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : summary ] with a brief summary and present our conclusions .",
    "for our analytic perturbation theory calculations we choose the simplest possible tight - binding model with carbon @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals , a two - center slater - koster approximation@xcite for nearest - neighbor hopping , and orthogonality between wannier functions centered on different sites assumed .",
    "this gives a tight - binding hamiltonian of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 label the four orbitals on each site , @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the two distinct sites in the honeycomb lattice unit cell , and @xmath22 is one of the three vectors connecting a lattice site and its near neighbors .",
    "we choose a coordinate system in which the honeycomb s bravais lattice has primitive vectors @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lattice constant of graphene .",
    "the corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors are @xmath25 and the near - neighbor translation vectors are : @xmath26 the site - diagonal matrix elements @xmath27 are the atomic energies of @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals , with the latter chosen as the zero of energy . in table",
    "[ tab : two_center ] we reproduce for completeness the relationship between the required nearest - neighbor hopping matrix elements @xmath28 and the four independent slater - koster parameters @xmath29 , @xmath9 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 whose numerical values specify this model quantitatively . if the graphene lattice is placed in the @xmath32 plane , @xmath33 for hops on the graphene lattice and the atomic @xmath34 orbitals decouple from other orbitals .",
    "this property is more general than our model , since it follows from the graphene plane inversion symmetry that orbitals which are even and odd under this symmetry operation will not be coupled , and is key to the way in which weak spin - orbit interactions influence the low - energy bands .",
    ".two - center matrix elements for hoping between @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals along a direction specified by the unit vector @xmath35 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these values imply a graphene energy gap at @xmath36 equal to @xmath37 where we used the nonorthogonal tight - binding parameters neglecting the overlap for simple estimations .",
    "our estimates of @xmath12 are discussed later .",
    "we have performed realistic _",
    "ab initio _ electronic structure calculations@xcite for inversion symmetric ( @xmath38 ) graphene sheets using the projector augmented wave ( paw)@xcite method with a perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite density functional in order to partly test the quantitative accuracy of the conclusions reached here about spin - orbit interaction gaps based on a simplified electronic structure model .",
    "the calculations were performed using vasp ( vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package)@xcite . in vasp ,",
    "spin - orbit interactions are implemented in the paw method which is based on a transformation that maps all electron wave functions to smooth pseudo wave functions .",
    "all physical properties are evaluated using pseudo wave functions .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is evaluated taking into account only the spherical part of the potential inside muffin tins surrounding the carbon nuclei : @xmath39 in order to make the gaps induced by spin - orbit interaction exceed the accuracy of vasp eigenvalues , we have artificially increased the strength of @xmath40 by up to 300 times by decreasing the speed of light @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig : band_so ] shows the tight - binding band structure of graphene for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 mev .",
    "the spin - orbit gap is not large on the scale of the full band width , even when enlarged by a factor of 300 .",
    "figure [ fig : gap_so ] compares the _ ab initio _ calculation and tight - binding model low - energy gaps at the hexagonal brillouin - zone corners for @xmath36 , finding close agreement .",
    "both approximations find a gap that grows as the second power of the spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "the close agreement is perhaps not surprising given that vasp also makes an atomiclike approximation for the spin - orbit coupling strength . in our opinion , however , the neglected contributions from interstitial regions and from aspherical potentials inside the muffin - tin sphere are small and their contributions to energy levels tends toward even smaller values due to spatial averaging by the bloch wave functions .",
    "we believe that these calculations demonstrate that the tight - binding model spin - orbit gap estimates are accurate .",
    "the intrinsic and rashba spin - orbit interactions arise from mixing between @xmath45 and @xmath46 bands due to atomic spin - orbit interactions alone in the case of @xmath11 ( eq.([eq : intrinsic ] ) ) and due to a combination of atomic spin - orbit and stark interactions in the case of @xmath47 ( eq.([eq : rashba ] ) ) .",
    "these expressions for @xmath11 and @xmath47 follow directly from eq.([eq : h_second ] ) and from the eigenvectors and eigenenergies listed in table [ tab : eigenvector_k ] .",
    "( the energetic ordering in table [ tab : eigenvector_k ] applies for @xmath48 which holds for the tight - binding parameters in table [ tab : hopping ] . )",
    "the pure @xmath49 hybridized bonding and antibonding states ( energies @xmath50 in table [ tab : eigenvector_k ] ) are symmetrically spaced with respect to the undoped fermi level and do not make a net contribution to either @xmath47 or @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath51 hybridized bonding states ( energy @xmath52 in table [ tab : eigenvector_k ] ) , on the other hand , are further from the fermi energy than the corresponding antibonding states ( energy @xmath53 in table [ tab : eigenvector_k ] ) because of the difference between atomic @xmath16 and @xmath17 energies .",
    "their net contribution to @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath16 and inversely related to @xmath9 , which sets the scale of the energy denominators .",
    "similar considerations explain the expression for @xmath47 which is proportional to @xmath0 and @xmath54 and inversely proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath47 vanishes at @xmath2 because of the inversion symmetry of an isolated graphene plane .",
    "the numerical value of the rashba interaction parameter @xmath12 obviously depends on the electric field perpendicular to the graphene plane which varies as the carrier density is modulated by a gate voltage .",
    "a typical value can be crudely estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rashba ] ) , by assuming a typical electric field @xmath56@xcite , and using the value @xmath57 obtained by scaling the hydrogenic orbital stark matrix element by the ratio of the atomic radii@xcite of carbon and hydrogen : @xmath58 the value of @xmath12 is influenced by screening of the electric field at one graphene atom by the polarization of other graphene atoms and by dielectric screening in the substrate and cap layers , but these correction factors are expected to be @xmath59 . note that our estimate for @xmath11 is 100 times smaller than kane s estimate,@xmath60 , whereas @xmath12 is 100 times larger than kane s estimate , @xmath61 . if our estimates are accurate , @xmath14 at large gate voltages . for undoped samples , however , the requirement for a quantized spin hall effect gap@xcite , @xmath62 , should still be achievable if accidental doping in the substrate and cap layer can be limited .",
    "when @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath12 , the energy gap closes and graphene becomes a zero gap semiconductor with quadratic dispersion@xcite .",
    "our estimates suggest that the quantum spin hall effect in graphene should occur only below @xmath63 , a temperature that is still accessible experimentally but not as convenient as @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , it seems likely that disorder will dominate over the spin - orbit couplings in current samples , so further progress in increasing the mobility of graphene sheets may also be necessary before the quantum spin hall effect can be realized experimentally .",
    "we emphasize , however@xcite , that the spin hall effect survives , albeit with a reduced magnitude , even when the spin - orbit gap is closed by disorder .    in summary , we have derived analytic expressions for the intrinsic and rashba spin - orbit interaction coupling constants that appear in the low - energy hamiltonian of a graphene sheet under a perpendicular external electric field .",
    "the rashba interaction parameter is first order in the atomic carbon spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath0 and the perpendicular external electric field @xmath1 , whereas the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction is second order in @xmath0 and independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the estimated energy gap for @xmath2 is of the order of 0.01@xmath3 and agrees with realistic _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations .",
