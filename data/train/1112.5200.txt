    "regular and important advances in semiconductor technology allow more and more complex processors to be designed . meanwhile ,",
    "progress in computing capacity is accompanied by a need for good representations of physical devices , which are required to remain pertinent at smaller and smaller scales .",
    "this trend naturally increases the number of physical properties to be accounted for when implementing logical devices .",
    "appropriate models become mandatory prerequisites for developing new techniques .",
    "this particularly is the case when adopting the approach of distributed systems or clockless circuits .",
    "obviously , time plays an important part in the operation of computing systems .",
    "the significant effects induced by time delays in modern electronic circuits point at limits that one rapidly reaches in a classical framework when looking for physically precise models .",
    "the only way to go beyond these limits is to adopt a new framework , able to match physical reality at a more fundamental level .",
    "practical difficulties met in disseminating and managing clock signals over complex designs have made the approach of clockless circuits particularly interesting and promising . but removing the clock does not mean that designs are freed from all the constraints associated with time .",
    "time is by itself a very complex notion , which is hardly captured in totality , even in most advanced physical theories .",
    "designing circuits around a single clock appears as a convenient way to implement known and classical properties related to time . in the absence of a clock , other solutions have to be found to ensure the proper time evolution of a circuit . to this end",
    ", one must reconsider the classical models of time that have been useful when designing existing electronic circuits .",
    "important progress in the control of time constraints in clockless circuits has been made with the notion of _ delay insensitivity _ @xcite . by removing any dependence on time lapses due to signal propagation ,",
    "one becomes able , with a simple set of rules , to ensure the correct functioning of clockless logical devices",
    ". with this efficient trick comes a new concept of the way distributed systems can synchronize their actions , by means of communication , in order to realize specified computations .",
    "remarkably , this approach follows , in the context of logical devices , a line which is very close to that followed by einstein , in the general context of physics , when introducing the founding concepts of relativity theory @xcite .",
    "the necessity of constructing a new framework emerges from the remark that no physical system exists that can deliver time over all space simultaneously .",
    "physical time , as it can be observed , is necessarily a spatially localized quantity . to promote time to a physical quantity that can be shared by remote observers ,",
    "propagation signals must be used .",
    "resulting propagation delays must be taken into account when synchronizing different  local times \" , that profoundly change the relations between space and time assumed in classical theories .",
    "a change of the notion of time has major consequences for the expression of causality @xcite . as causality clearly depends on a notion of order in time , a drastic change in the possibility of time ordering , as raised by the relativistic framework , implies a revision of the dependence of all operations , including logical ones , on causal relations .",
    "the effect of the change in the properties of time induced by relativity on distributed systems has already been discussed in the literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "many formalisms also exist that describe computing concurrency and have provided efficient models for designing and analyzing asynchronous circuits . on one hand , petri networks @xcite and their interpretation called signal transition graphs ( stg )",
    "@xcite have provided powerful representations of partial orders and causal relations in logic circuits . on the other hand ,",
    "trace semantics , communicating sequential processes ( csp ) @xcite , and related approaches @xcite , are preferred in modelling complex systems .",
    "a formalism sharing both qualities would be particularly helpful for efficiently simulating and implementing causal relations in asynchronous circuits of high complexity .",
    "we shall show here that a closer account of physical causality , based on the relativistic notion of time ordering , provides a way to modify the formalism of traces so that causal relations can be represented in a natural way .",
    "this representation should make them easier to implement in arbitrarily complex designs . in order to fulfill that aim ,",
    "a key step is to give communications between components a representation that naturally satisfies the constraints imposed by relativistic time orders .",
    "remarkably , udding s rules @xcite , which are used to define communications within di systems , appear to suit this purpose . rewriting these rules in terms of r - traces",
    ", we shall exhibit their intrinsic connection with relativistic causality .    in the first two sections we recall the profound changes brought by the relativistic framework to the notions of time , time - ordering and causal relations . in the following sections , we introduce generalizations of traces , called r - traces , and use them to rewrite udding s rules .",
    "we also briefly describe how r - traces map onto the usual traces in a classical environment . in conclusion",
    ", we point at some properties and other potential applications of r - traces .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall the properties of time according to relativity theory @xcite , in contrast to those which are implicitly assumed in a classical framework . we discuss the new status given by relativity theory to simultaneity in time , and the notion of order in time that follows .",
    "consequently , the notion of causality used in a relativistic framework significantly differs from its classical analog .",
    "although time and space can be treated as distinct concepts in classical theory , this can no longer be the case in a relativistic framework , where these notions can not be considered as being independent . to be precise , within a classical framework , time",
    "is not affected by a change of frame ( or observer ) .",
    "for instance , coordinates @xmath0 in an inertial frame are related to coordinates @xmath1 in another frame , with relative velocity @xmath2 , according to the usual galilean transformation ( for simplicity , expressions are written here for a single spatial dimension ) : @xmath3 on the other hand , the same change of inertial frame within a relativistic framework introduces a dependence of time on spatial positions ( light propagates at a finite velocity @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 this fundamental property is in fact a direct consequence of the definition of time in terms of physical observables and of the existence of a maximum propagation speed , @xmath4 .",
    "no physical system exists that can provide time simultaneously within a whole extended area in space .",
    "time can only be obtained from a clock locally , that is at a given place in space @xcite .",
    "time can then only be defined over all space by comparing clocks located at different spatial positions .",
    "these comparisons are made by means of propagating signals . as a consequence of the delays due to propagation at finite speed ( even at light velocity @xmath4 )",
    "the notion of simultaneity is frame dependent .",
    "for instance , in contrast to its classical analog ( [ class ] ) , the relativistic transformation of time ( [ relat ] ) shows that two events @xmath6 and @xmath7 that occur simultaneously but at different places in a given frame , loose their simultaneity when they are seen in a relatively moving frame . @xmath8",
    "the existence of an absolute global time , independent of space , is ruined by the impossibility of defining simultaneity over all space in a frame - independent way .",
    "this however excludes neither the possibility of defining simultaneity , but in a frame - dependent way , nor the existence of frame - independent properties of time .",
    "the last possibility appears to be easier to realize .",
    "following that option , one remarks that expressions ( [ relat ] ) describe the transformations of space and time under the action of the lorentz group .",
    "these transformations generalize to spacetime the action of the group of spatial rotations .",
    "it corresponds to transformations that preserve the spacetime interval @xmath9 between two events @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath10 spacetime intervals ( [ interval ] ) are invariant under frame transformations ( [ relat ] ) and allow one to define spacetime relations and subsets that are independent of the observer . in particular , a null spacetime interval ( @xmath11 ) characterizes a pair of events @xmath12 that can be joined by a motion at the maximum speed @xmath4 , i.e. which lie on the same light ray .",
    "the light rays that are incident on a same event @xmath6 define a subset @xmath13 , the light cone from event @xmath6 ( see equation ( [ interval ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath14 @xmath13 bounds the part of spacetime which can be reached by signals sent or received at @xmath6 : it realizes a partition of spacetime into three subsets .",
    "@xmath15 the interior of a light cone @xmath16 consists of all spacetime events @xmath7 that are separated from event @xmath6 by a time - like interval ( @xmath17 ) , while the exterior of the same light cone @xmath18 consists of all events @xmath7 that are separated from event @xmath6 by a space - like interval ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the interior of light cone @xmath16 furthermore consists of two disjoint parts which describe the _ future _ of event @xmath6 ( @xmath20 ) , and the _ past _ of event @xmath6 ( @xmath21 ) . @xmath22",
    "all the latter properties are frame - independent .",
    "let us note that as opposed to the interior @xmath16 , the exterior of a light cone @xmath18 can not be partitioned in a frame - independent way into two parts corresponding to a positive ( @xmath23 ) or negative ( @xmath24 ) time interval .",
    "indeed , for events @xmath7 in @xmath18 , the sign of the time interval @xmath25 depends on the observer .",
    "these properties exhibit a major difference due to the relativistic framework : given a particular event @xmath6 , there exists a subset of events @xmath7 that have a definite position in time with respect to @xmath6 ( @xmath16 ) , but also a large subset of events @xmath7 that can not have a definite position in time relative to event @xmath6 ( @xmath18 ) .    equations ( [ future_past ] ) show that , although two arbitrary events can not be ordered in time , due to the frame dependence of the simultaneity property ( [ simultaneity ] ) , nonetheless all events belonging to @xmath20 are posterior to @xmath6 while all events belonging to @xmath21 are anterior to @xmath6 , both properties being frame - independent .",
    "one remarks that the existence of a time order between two events is a symmetric property : @xmath26 two events @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfying conditions ( [ causal_relation ] ) are ordered in time and can thus be causally related . moreover ,",
    "this property is easily seen to be transitive .",
    "@xmath27 in other words , although not allowing a total time ordering of events , the relativistic framework still allows one to define a partial time - ordering that does not depend on the observer .",
    "this property is necessary and sufficient for formulating causality in physics .",

    "in the context of logic devices , the term ` event ' usually denotes a transition or a pulse , propagating through a wire or an electromagnetic channel @xcite .",
    "according to previous discussions , the latter rather corresponds to a ray , connecting points located on a same light cone ( figure [ esp - tmp ] ) .",
    "but , it is easily seen that , when sent or received , such a logical ` event ' also corresponds to a transition that is localized in time , and which can thus be identified with a spacetime ` event ' @xcite .",
    "these two characteristic properties , namely localization in time and spreading over space , are precisely the ones that are necessary for synchronizing actions performed at different locations in space .",
    "they also allow the local notion of ` logical event ' , defined as a logical action occurring in a device in coincidence with a spacetime ` event ' , to be extended to communications , i.e. : logical actions occurring in different devices in a correlated way .",
    "in the latter case , ` logical events ' are associated with propagations rather than points in spacetime .",
    "as previously discussed , they must respect the constraints fixed by the existence of a bound on propagation speeds , hence the light cone partitions of spacetime .",
    "they may alternatively be seen as a minimal description , regarding logical properties , of events occurring at the boundary between two devices with different spatial locations . for simplicity and when",
    "no confusion may arise , we shall in the following use the same term ` event ' for denoting both concepts .    figure",
    "[ esp - tmp ] also shows an event @xmath7 that lies in the future light cone of @xmath6 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this property is equivalent to the possibility for a physical system to travel from event @xmath6 to event @xmath7 with a speed that is lower than light velocity @xmath4 , the largest allowed velocity .",
    "event @xmath7 can then be said to occur _ after _",
    "event @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , as no definite time order can be attributed to an event @xmath30 lying outside of the light cone from @xmath6 ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 is space - like ) , @xmath30 is said to be ` contemporary with @xmath6 ' .",
    "these properties can be used to express relativistic causality .",
    "two actions occurring at different locations in spacetime can be causally related only if the two events @xmath6 and @xmath7 at which they occur are ordered in time , i.e. satisfy relation ( [ causal_relation ] ) .",
    "in that case , these two actions may produce a result that depends on the time - order of events @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "conversely , two actions occurring at two events @xmath6 and @xmath30 that are contemporary , i.e. @xmath6 and @xmath30 satisfy ( [ acausal_relation ] ) , produce a result that can not depend on their order , as the latter can not be identified with an order in time .",
    "one deduces that the result of two actions occurring at two different events @xmath6 and @xmath7 can depend on the order of these actions if and only if @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be ordered in time ( [ causal_relation ] ) .",
    "otherwise , two actions occurring at events satisfying equations ( [ acausal_relation ] ) must be considered to be independent of each other and hence can not satisfy a causal relation .",
    "computation reduces , in present realizations , to chaining elementary operations performed on boolean variables , linking these operations through a finite set of prescribed logical relations .",
    "this occurs in logic devices performing successive operations ruled by a clock or in asynchronous ( clockless ) circuits as well . in all cases ,",
    "specifications are satisfied by linking the prescribed logical rules to causal relations constraining the physical systems in which they are realized .",
    "not surprisingly , logic devices can be designed in a satisfactory way only when an appropriate representation of causal relations is available .",
    "modern logic devices are implemented in highly integrated components , pushing the limits of transport properties . due to clocks operating at high frequencies and despite small dimensions , the limits affecting the propagation of signals within a chip , due to bounded propagation speeds ,",
    "can not be ignored .",
    "a major consequence , as discussed in previous section , is a breakdown of the classical ( newtonian or galilean ) representation of time - ordering , pointing at the necessity of a genuinely relativistic representation .",
    "obviously , the same remarks apply to distributed systems  to systems made of components with large separations ( measured as propagation times ) when compared with their internal period @xcite .",
    "distributed systems or asynchronous circuits can be seen to involve two different kinds of logical processes :    * transitions associated with changes of state of a local component , * communications associated with exchanges of data between components .",
    "both kinds of processes must be considered when defining the specifications of distributed systems or asynchronous circuits and when setting their communication protocols . moreover ,",
    "these logical processes should be associated with implementations corresponding to two different kinds of events , this notion being understood according to the two different conceptions discussed in the previous section .",
    "the implementation of logical processes relies on the existence of causal relations , hence on the possibility of ordering in time , the corresponding events .",
    "more precisely , the time order of two events becomes an objective property as soon as each event belongs to the interior of the other s light cone ( [ causal_relation ] ) , or else as soon as they define a time - like interval ( [ light - cones ] ) .",
    "two different kinds of time - like intervals can be seen to be involved in the definition of distributed systems or asynchronous circuits :    * intervals between two events characterizing the successive states of one local component ; * intervals between two events characterizing the emission and reception of communication signals .",
    "the fact that the second case also corresponds to a time - like interval rather than to a light - like interval is due to the fact that , depending on the technology and implementation choices , signals may propagate at a maximum speed smaller than or equal to , the light velocity .",
    "this entails no fundamental consequences , as all properties due to the existence of a maximum propagation speed still hold .",
    "figure [ esp - tmp ] shows two events @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath7 occurring after @xmath6 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "although different observers may attribute different dates to these two events , corresponding to different time delays undergone by a signal propagating from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , all observers will nonetheless agree on the time - like character of the interval @xmath9 ( @xmath17 ) and on the time - order of the two events ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the corresponding physical time delay coincides with the _ delay _ accounted for when designing electronic circuits . as opposed to the time delay itself , the time - like character of the interval between two events @xmath6 and @xmath7 and their time order ( here @xmath7 _ after _",
    "@xmath6 ) , are objective properties . as illustrated by this simple example , the time - ordering properties of logical events , when physically implemented in logic devices , correspond to _ delay insensitive _ ( di ) properties .",
    "when implementing logical operations in physical devices , the dependence of physical causality on time - ordering imposes constraints that tend to limit their performance . in practice , one must either control time - orders , hence time delays , at the level required by the operation frequency and size of the device , or design processors so that their operation can resist arbitrary variations of time delays .",
    "these options are not exclusive and solutions adopted in existing processors take advantage of both possibilities .",
    "timing methods significantly help improve the performance of clocked circuits , and nowadays , processors routinely include self - timed asynchronous parts to benefit from a locally enhanced level of performance @xcite .",
    "the increasing cost in both complexity and power consumption , entailed by monitoring time lapses over highly integrated circuits , however leads one to favor approaches that can escape , as much as possible , time delay constraints .",
    "the formalization of delay insensitivity ( di ) @xcite provides a powerful conceptual framework for designing asynchronous circuits . confronting this approach to the relativistic background of physical processes",
    ", we shall try in the following to understand di rules as the result of general and fundamental constraints imposed by physical causality on the implementation of logic devices .",
    "we now focus on logical operations and on their implementations as processes in physical devices . in general , the result of two successive logical operations depends on the order in which they are performed . at the level of physical processes ,",
    "the ordering of logical operations is given by the time - ordering of the events at which they occur .",
    "for that reason , we shall identify in the following , the time - ordering of logical operations with the ordering of the corresponding events .",
    "upper case letters denoting events will just be replaced by lower case letters when denoting logical operations .",
    "we also introduce some simplifying notations to represent ordering when expressed on logical operations rather than events .",

    "let us note that relations @xmath46 can also be seen as a particular case of the relations @xmath47 introduced by lamport @xcite to provide a general formalization of logical time in distributed computations .",
    "these definitions however differ in an important way : @xmath44 and @xmath45 refer here to an ordering with respect to ` physical time ' , although @xmath47 refer to a constructed ` logical time ' @xcite .",
    "one could alternatively say that the choice to model implementations of logic devices at the level of electronic components leaves less freedom for a representation of time .",
    "as already stated , the expression of causality in physics strongly depends on the notion of time ordering .",
    "it should be clear however that causal relations do not reduce to time - order relations .",
    "obviously , two physical actions , in particular two logical operations , can happen to be ordered in time without being causally related .",

    "udding s rules @xcite are a formalization of the intuitive idea underlying di - systems , which was previously introduced under the form of the foam rubber wrapper ( frw ) metaphor @xcite .",
    "the frw metaphor discusses how a change of propagation delays can change the order of signals in time , and suggests ways to protect component specifications against such changes in time - ordering . udding translated the notion of frw into a set of logical constraints , to be imposed on trace structures specifying components , so that specifications become invariant under changes of time - ordering due to propagation delays .    in the classical framework of traces @xcite",

    "one can alternatively say in a relativistic framework that the notion of time - order becomes ambiguous for events at the boundary .",
    "this is due to the spatial extension of the boundary between a component and its environment , which entails the impossibility of ascribing a definite time - order to events occurring in this area . in this context ,",
    "r - traces , which preserve the notion of trace while describing a partial order , appear as a natural generalization . meanwhile , r - traces bring another important semantic change , as they are not only associated with events occuring at a single location in space , but also with propagation events .",

    "r - traces now constrain the specification of a single object that is a _ component - environment pair _ and express the dialog between a component and its environment , and more precisely causality relations satisfied by propagations between them . let us note that as they are compatible with time - ordering in relativistic spacetime , these causality relations make di - systems compatible , not only with a change in place&route on a chip at the design stage , but also with changes due to process variations or to motions of components during computation .    in the following , we rewrite udding s rules and discuss them using spacetime diagrams .",

    "we now discuss how relativistic traces reduce to classical traces when communications can be considered to occur in a classical spacetime ( i.e. assuming that propagations and time delays are totally controlled , at the level of elementary logical operations ) . accordingly , relativistic rules reduce to their classical analogs .",
    "this reduction amounts to a mapping that transforms r - traces into classical traces .",
    "in particular , the set of symbols @xmath36 , @xmath35 , @xmath59 , @xmath184 is reduced when operations are restricted to a classical environment which is more constraining , as symbol @xmath184 is not supported any more .",
    "let us note that an r - trace describes a partial time - ordering that applies in particular to _ propagations _ , although a classical trace describes a total time - ordering which refers to _ points _ in spacetime .",
    "both notions however coincide when applied to events , i.e. to signals at the input or output ports of a component . hence , although a symbol @xmath36 does not a priori denote the same object in a r - trace as in a trace , it is legitimate to define its mapping from a r - trace to a classical trace .",

    "* @xmath187 is mapped onto @xmath188 .",

    "this mapping amounts to replacing the absence of time - order , unavoidable in a relativistic framework , by the two possible orders , as imposed by the syntax of classical traces . as illustrated by spacetime diagrams , one r - trace maps onto a pair of classical traces .",
    "this corresponds to the two different geometrical situations that can result when two intersecting slanted arrows are made to separately intersect the two vertical lines representing a component and its environment .",
    "both resulting traces have to be present in the specification of the component .",
    "indeed , all relativistic rules end with the form @xmath190 which is mapped onto the expression @xmath191 in other words , all these rules concern the absence of causal order and their restriction to classical spacetime amounts to imposing the presence of the two opposite orders .",
    "the resulting rules are easily seen to correspond to the standard ones .",
    "in fact , one can note that it is precisely because udding s rules have the property of imposing the presence of the two opposite orders that they can be obtained as restrictions of relativistic rules .",
    "this is the reason why the notion of di - systems can be generalized to relativistic spacetime with its partial time - ordering .",
    "the relativistic and classical frameworks lead to conceptions of time that differ in a significant way .",
    "time - simultaneity and total ordering in time are classical properties . in contrast ,",
    "relativistic time can only satisfy a partial ordering to remain compatible with observer - dependent propagation delays .",
    "practical methods depending on the classical properties of time may reach a point where they cease to be sufficient for a circuit to properly function , due to propagation delays .",
    "the models used to design logic devices can then be improved by releasing these properties and looking for a better implementation of relativistic causality . in particular , causal relations can be made compatible with the impossibility for some events to satisfy a time order @xcite .",
    "delay insensitivity represents an efficient criterion for designing functional clockless circuits in a simple way .",
    "but usual models , such as the trace formalism , rely on a classical representation of time - ordering and causality .",
    "nonetheless , traces can be generalized to r - traces which provide a similar description of the dialog between a di component and its environment while being compatible with relativistic causality .",
    "the usual formalism @xcite is recovered when implementations of components are restricted to a classical environment .",
    "an r - trace structure describes the specification of a component - environment pair as the list of all time orders that can hold between the communication events of the pair dialog .",
    "when rewritten , udding s rules keep a simple form that clarifies their relation with causality properties .",
    "although the r - trace formalism , when applied to specifications of di components , takes a form similar to its classical analog @xcite , interpretations differ significantly .",
    "r - trace structures describe the time - order and causality relations of all events , including signal propagations , while classical structures only refer to events that are localized in time .",
    "the biggest merit of the r - trace formalism is to clarify the semantics underlying udding s rules by exhibiting their intrinsic relation with time - ordering and physical causality .",
    "further theoretical insight , with potential consequences for applications , could be gained by comparing r - traces to other existing formalisms dealing with delay insensitivity .",
    "criteria have indeed been developed to perform such comparisons as , for instance , the strength of semantic properties in equivalence relationships @xcite .    besides a clear representation of causal relations , another merit of the r - trace formalism",
    "is to replace the description of a distributed system as a set of individual components that communicate by a composition of component - environment pairs .",
    "this rather describes the composition of _ interfaces _ , where _ interface _ means the dialog between the two members of a pair .",
    "in contrast to alternative descriptions of causality , such as petri nets , this conception allows a simple composition of multiple components , by considering the latter as a multiplication of interfaces .",
    "this approach also opens new and interesting possibilities for solving questions raised by the synchronization of complex distributed systems @xcite .",
    "a further advantage of the formalism is its ability to include in the description , with minor changes , components in motion .",
    "this could also allow the treatment of distributed algorithms on a network of mobile computers within the formalism of di systems .",
