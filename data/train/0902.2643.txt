    "dark matter ( dm ) has been postulated to explain various observations from gravitational effects on visible matter and plays an important role to explain structure formation and galaxy evolution . in recent years observations and the high precision analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation have provided spectacular confirmation of the astrophysical evidence for dm , that is to say about quarter of the energy density of the universe is dark matter .",
    "dark matter appears to be consisting of nonrelativistic particles that only interact gravitationally and perhaps by weak interaction .",
    "mostly the coupling to photons is assumed to be nonexistent or very weak , so the electromagnetic interactions have not been considered seriously . a possible scenario for electromagnetic interaction of dirac fermionic dark",

    "the various experimental bounds was investigated @xcite in the past and a new experimental technique @xcite for dm detection by electromagnetic interaction has been suggested for nonzero dipoles . there is a dm scenario for the electromagnetic interaction by the fractional or millie charged particles @xcite , but the dm scenario is for the case that another massless @xmath4 gauge boson , called paraphoton , exists beyond the standard model .    in this letter",
    "we consider electric dipole moment effect of dirac fermionic dark matter . the electric dipole moment ( edm ) constrained by direct searches",
    "is investigated as considering the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleus .",
    "the wimp - nucleus elastic scattering is due to spin independent interaction , that gives the wimp electric dipole moment very strict bound since the wimp - nucleus elastic scattering cross sections are enhanced by the square of nuclear charge ( number of protons in the nucleus ) , @xmath5 .",
    "the wimp electric dipole moment constrained by direct searches must be lower than @xmath6 @xmath1 for wimp mass of 100 gev to satisfy the current experimental exclusion limits .",
    "wimp electric dipole moment is scaled as considering the current experimental exclusion limit of electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xcite for the known dirac particles and the scenario that presented in ref.@xcite to investigate the wimp detectability .",
    "a simple model ( lagrangian ) with the complex dipole coupling is also introduced .",
    "although we consider that the interaction of edm is suppressed by cp violation , the suppression could be compensated by the enhancement of spin independent interaction .",
    "wimp could thus be detected by the edm interaction in near future if the suppression is not seriously small .",
    "the detection of dark matter is controlled by their elastic scattering with a nucleus in a detector . in this case",

    "the contributions of the heavy quark ( @xmath18 and @xmath7 ) to wimp - nucleon cross section can be related to the gluon contribution by qcd , but those appear in quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "so three valance quarks give the nucleon its global electric charge and the contributions of each valance quark in the nucleon add coherently .",
    "the similar argument can be applied to the nuclei .",
