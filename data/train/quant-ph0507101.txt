    "<S> we propose a new way to generate an observable geometric phase by means of a completely incoherent phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to imprint a geometric phase to a system by `` adiabatically '' manipulating the environment with which it interacts . as a specific scheme we analyse a multilevel atom interacting with a broad - band squeezed vacuum bosonic bath . </S>",
    "<S> as the squeezing parameters are smoothly changed in time along a closed loop , the ground state of the system acquires a geometric phase . </S>",
    "<S> we propose also a scheme to measure such geometric phase by means of a suitable polarization detection .    </S>",
    "<S> whenever a pure quantum state undergoes a parallel transport along a closed path , it gathers information on the geometric structure of the hilbert space in which it lies . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we will show that a a possible way to generate such a parallel transport is by way of an irreversible quantum evolution . </S>",
    "<S> in several models of interaction with the environment there are some `` protected '' subspaces , like the decoherence free subspaces ( dfs ) , which are left unaffected  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> states lying in these subspaces are _ stationary _ , i.e. they do not evolve in time . </S>",
    "<S> a typical example is the ground state of an atomic system , which , trivially , remain unaffected by the coupling with the electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are situations in which the interaction between a system and an engineered environment can generate non - trivial ground states  @xcite . for instance , when a group of atoms collectively interacts with a broad band squeezed vacuum , the highly non - classical correlations which are present in the field are transferred to the atomic system , which relaxes in a complex pure equilibrium state . in such a scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the control over the engineered reservoir allows an indirect control on the state of the system to which it is coupled  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest is the possibility to change in time the reservoir parameters in such a way that the `` protected '' system subspace evolves in a controlled fashion . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that if this change in time is made slowly enough , a state lying in such a subspace evolves coherently and acquires information about the geometry of the space explored .    as an explicit example , we consider a suitable multilevel atomic system interacting with a broad band squeezed vacuum . to be more specific let us consider first a three level atom whose interaction with an electromagnetic field in the rotating wave approximation is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 d\\omega \\text{,}\\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the free atomic hamiltonian , @xmath2 is the atomic operator describing the absorption of an excitation and @xmath3 is the annihilation operator of the mode with frequency @xmath4 ( @xmath5 . the field , which we treat as a reservoir , is assumed to be in a broad band squeezed vacuum state . in mathematical terms , this is obtained from the ordinary field vacuum state by means of the unitary operator @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 d\\omega\\right\\}\\ ] ] is a multimode squeezing transformation  @xcite , which correlates symmetrical pairs of modes around the carrier frequency @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the squeezing parameter , whose polar coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 are called phase and amplitude of the squeezing , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of the born markov approximation , justified by the broadband nature of the field , leads to the following master equation for the atomic degrees of freedom  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 from ( [ rmatrix ] ) follows that the state @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , satisfies @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , this state is unaffected by the environment , i.e. it is decoherence free . </S>",
    "<S> moreover @xmath20 represents the new ground state , as all the other states of the atomic system relax to it .    </S>",
    "<S> as anticipated , the key idea is to smoothly change the squeezing parameter of the field in order to `` adiabatically '' drag a state initially prepared in @xmath21 into @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the time dependent squeezing parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we will show the existence of an `` adiabatic '' limit such that the transition probability of @xmath24 to the orthogonal subspace vanishes as the rate of change of @xmath25 becomes sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we will show that after a cyclic evolution of @xmath25 , the state @xmath26 acquires a geometric phase . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth stressing that this procedure , although reminiscent of the usual adiabatic evolution , is a different physical phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the usual adiabatic approximation refers to a coherent evolution , obtained by tuning the parameters of the system hamiltonian , while the `` steering process '' discussed here is achieved manipulating the environment . </S>",
    "<S> the essential difference is that in the latter case the system state can be adiabatically controlled entirely by means of an incoherent phenomenon and no hamiltonian term contributes to its time evolution . to show how this incoherent adiabatic steering process can take place , </S>",
    "<S> consider the time dependent version of equation  ( [ mastereq ] ) where @xmath27 is explicitly dependent on time through @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to express the equation of motion in the reference frame where @xmath28 is time independent . to this end , consider the following unitary transformation @xmath29 from the basis @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 to the time dependent basis @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath26 coincides with @xmath35 under this change of frame , the equation of motion becomes @xmath36\\text{,}\\ ] ] where , in this new frame , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a hamiltonian term arising from the change of picture . moreover , in this frame the lindbladian term , @xmath41 , assumes a simple diagonal form :    @xmath42    the main advantage of this transformation is that it allows to formulate clearly the adiabatic condition , since the rate of change of the environment parameters are contained in the operator @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the limit that we are interested in is the one in which the dominant contribution in equation  ( [ eq : newmastereq ] ) comes from the incoherent terms , i.e. @xmath44 .    an interesting case is the one in which the squeezing amplitude is kept constant while its phase is slowly changed from @xmath45 to @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this adiabatic evolution can be easily achieved by tuning , for example , the carrier frequency , @xmath47 , of the squeezed state slightly off resonance from the two photon transition @xmath48 . by introducing this detuning , @xmath49 , ( assuming @xmath50 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the master equation obtained has the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mastereq ] ) and  ( [ rmatrix ] ) where @xmath51 is replaced by @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a sufficiently small value of @xmath49 determines the required adiabatic evolution . under this condition </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath43 assumes the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , when @xmath56 is small enough , the state @xmath57 is adiabatically decoupled from its orthogonal subspace and a cyclic evolution in @xmath51 results in a geometric phase acquired by @xmath26 depending only , in this case , on the amount of squeezing @xmath58 . note however that , since the steering process is essentially incoherent , any phase information acquired by a superposition of @xmath28 and a state belonging to the orthogonal subspace is inevitably lost , as the latter is subject to decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> the only way to retain such information is to consider an auxiliary level @xmath59 , unaffected by the noise , playing the role of a reference state for an interferometric measurement . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> assume that @xmath59 is unaffected by the environment during the whole evolution , and , hence , is time independent . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the action of the unitary transformation @xmath60 on @xmath59 is trivial , and equation  ( [ eq : newmastereq ] ) remains essentially unchanged .    </S>",
    "<S> the whole information about the geometrical phase and the coherence retained by the system during its evolution is then recorded in the phase and amplitude of the density matrix term @xmath61 , whose evolution is described by the following set of coupled differential equations @xmath62 where @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> assume that initially the excited states @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the system are not populated , hence @xmath64 and the coherence @xmath65 evolves as @xmath66           \\text{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67    in the limit @xmath68 we obtain for the coherence @xmath65 @xmath69 where @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in a cyclic evolution , corresponding to @xmath71 . by retaining only the leading terms in @xmath72 the total evolution at time @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath74     and @xmath31 and between @xmath31 and @xmath30 is @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions between these level are coupled to the modes @xmath3 of the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the reference state @xmath59 is decoupled from the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> + ( b ) five - level system , transitions @xmath75 and @xmath76 are coupled to modes @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are coupled to modes @xmath80 of the reservoir . ]    where we have substituted @xmath81 with @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , going back to the original frame by means of @xmath83 ) , the corresponding coherence @xmath84 is given by : @xmath85 for example a state initially prepared in @xmath86 , after closing the loop , evolves into @xmath87 where @xmath88 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from this expression , that in the limit @xmath89 the dominant contribution to the time evolution is just a phase factor @xmath90 , with @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that in the `` adiabatic '' approximation , the system preserves its coherence . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , according to equation  ( [ eq : cohe ] ) , the amplitude damping of @xmath92 occurs only when we take into account the first order contribution in @xmath93 , which shows an exponential decay rate of the order of @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that for small @xmath56 the system admits an adiabatic limit , in which the subspace @xmath95 spanned by @xmath96 and @xmath59 is adiabatically decoupled from its orthogonal subspace @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , @xmath95 is decoupled from the effects of the decoherence , which only affect states lying in its orthogonal subspace .    within this approximation , then </S>",
    "<S> , a state prepared in the space @xmath98 is adiabatically transported rigidly inside the evolving subspace @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> as a result of this adiabatic steering , when the system is brought back to its initial configuration , the coherence @xmath92 acquires a phase @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> this phase can be interpreted as the geometric phase accumulated by the state @xmath96 . by using the canonical formula for the berry phase , it easy to see that the geometric phase of @xmath96 is given by @xmath99 </S>",
    "<S> as expected the value of @xmath100 depends only on the squeezing , and vanishes as the squeezing tends to zero . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , notice that the phase @xmath100 is purely geometrical , i.e. there is no dynamical contribution arising from an existing hamiltonian , since , in absence of any steering process , the states inside @xmath101 have a trivial dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the measurement of this phase a relatively easy task . </S>",
    "<S> usual procedures to measure geometric phases make use of suitably designed techniques to eliminate dynamical phase contributions , such as spin - echo  @xcite or parallel transport conditions  @xcite . in this setup , </S>",
    "<S> the geometric phase is the only contribution to the phase accumulated by @xmath26 , and hence , it is straightforward to measure by a suitable interferometric setup .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple scheme to measure the geometric phase obtained by such a steering process can be realized with a simple variation of our system . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the five - level atomic system shown in picture  [ fig : sys4l](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it essentially consists of two replicas of the three - level system discussed above , with the level @xmath31 in common . </S>",
    "<S> the important ingredient is that transitions @xmath102 and @xmath103 are coupled with modes of the reservoir which are different from those coupled to the transitions @xmath104 and @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple way to achieve this , is to choose , for example , polarisation selective transitions , say , left - circularly polarised modes for the former transitions and right - circularly polarised for the latter ones . </S>",
    "<S> the complete hamiltonian of such system is : @xmath106 d\\omega \\text{,}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 , and @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is the annihilation operator of the mode with the energy @xmath4 and polarization @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> assume broadband squeezed vacuum states for the set of modes @xmath77 and modes @xmath80 with different squeezing parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 : @xmath114 where @xmath115 are the analogous of the operator  ( [ eq : squeezer ] ) acting on the set of modes @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> under the same assumptions which lead to equation  ( [ mastereq ] ) we obtain the master equation : @xmath117 where @xmath118 , and @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> this system admits a two - dimensional decoherent - free subspace , spanned by states @xmath120 and @xmath121 whose definition is the analogous of state @xmath26 of equation  ( [ eq : dfstate ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume again time dependent squeezing parameters @xmath122 , and again we examine the time dependence of the system in a rotating frame , i.e. a frame where the state @xmath123 appear stationary . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the following master equation for the five - level system in the rotating frame : @xmath124\\text{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 , @xmath126 being the unitary transformation producing the change of frame . </S>",
    "<S> assume again , for simplicity , that the parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 are kept constant and that @xmath129 . under this assumption , the master equation can be exactly solved . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is analogous to the one obtained for system previously analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the system is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of state @xmath130 and @xmath131 , for example : @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> at a later time one has @xmath133 with @xmath134 and @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> when the parameter @xmath51 closes a loop , at @xmath136 , the coherence has gained a phase @xmath137 which is the difference between the geometric phases @xmath138 acquired by the states @xmath139 , respectively . as in the previous scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the visibility is reduced by a factor which is linear in the `` adiabatic parameters '' @xmath140 , which guarantees the existence of the adiabatic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this modified scheme is that the value of the geometric phases can be readily measured from the polarisation of the light emitted when the system relaxes . </S>",
    "<S> infact , if the value of the squeezing parameters @xmath141 is suddenly switched to zero , the states @xmath139 are no longer decoherece free , and decay to a superposition of the ground states @xmath32 and @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> this dissipation process is accompanied by two photon emissions into the reservoir . due to the structure of the interaction  ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) with the reservoir , the photon emitted due to the transitions @xmath143 and @xmath144 , is polarised according to the geometric phase accumulated between @xmath120 and @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if @xmath77 and @xmath80 are right and left circularly polarised modes , respectively , the first dissipation process produces the linearly polarised photon : @xmath145 the detection of the polarisation of the emitted photon makes possible a direct measurement of of the geometric phase .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a scheme to generate a geometric phase via a completely incoherent control procedure . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme is conceptually different from the usual coherent adiabatic control . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is realized through a smooth evolution of suitable hamiltonians , whereas here , the adiabatic steering is the effect of an externally controlled environment . </S>",
    "<S> the phase generated is purely geometrical , and , therefore , experimentally detectable without resorting to techniques for the elimination of dynamical contributions . due to its very nature , this scheme is immune from unwanted environmental effects . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , like any geometric effects , it presents an inherent degree of robustness against uncertainties in the control parameters . </S>"
