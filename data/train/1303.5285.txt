    "wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) @xcite have become popular in variety of applications such as military surveillance , environmental , transportation traffic , temperature , pressure and vibration monitoring . to achieve fault tolerance , wsns consist of hundreds or even thousands of sensor randomly distributed with in the region @xcite .",
    "all the nodes report sensed data to base station ( bs ) often called sink .",
    "nodes in wsns are power constrained due to limited battery resource , and they might be placed where they can not be accessed , so , impossible to recharge or replace . to save energy , regular and long distance communication should be avoided to prolong network lifetime @xcite .",
    "sensor nodes take self decisions to accomplish sensing tasks , constructing network topology and routing policy .",
    "therefore , it become important to design energy efficient algorithm for enhancing robustness against node failures and extending lifetime of wsns .    efficiently grouping sensor nodes in form of clusters",
    "is beneficial in minimizing the energy utilization .",
    "numerous energy efficient protocols are made based on clustering structure@xcite . in clustering , nodes assemble themselves in form of clusters with one node acting as the cluster head ( ch ) .",
    "all cluster member nodes transmit sensed data to their ch , while the ch aggregate data received and forward it to the remote bs @xcite .",
    "clustering can be formed in two kind of networks i.e. , homogenous and heterogeneous .",
    "wsns having nodes of same energy level are called homogenous wsns .",
    "low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy ( leach ) @xcite , power efficient gathering in sensor information systems ( pegasis ) @xcite and hybrid energy - efficient distributed clustering ( heed ) @xcite are examples of cluster based protocols which are designed for homogenous wsns .",
    "these algorithms poorly perform in heterogeneous regions .",
    "nodes have less energy will expire faster than high energy nodes because these homogenous clustering based algorithms are incapable to treat every node with respect to energy . in heterogeneous wsns ,",
    "nodes are deployed with different initial energy levels .",
    "heterogeneity in wsn may be the result of re - energizing of wsn in order to extend the network lifetime @xcite .",
    "stable election protocol ( sep ) @xcite , distributed energy efficient clustering ( deec ) @xcite , developed deec ( ddeec ) @xcite , enhanced deec ( edeec ) @xcite are protocols for heterogenous wsns .",
    "the radio energy model describes that l - bit message is transmitted over a distance @xmath0 as in @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "1 .        @xmath1     + where @xmath2 is energy used per bit to run transmitter or receiver circuit .",
    "free space @xmath3 model is used if distance is in less than threshold otherwise multi path @xmath4 model .",
    "now , total energy dissipated in the network during a round is given below , as supossed @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 + where , @xmath6= number of clusters , + @xmath7= data aggregation cost expended in ch + @xmath8= average distance between ch and bs + @xmath9= average distance between cluster members and ch + assuming all nodes are uniformly distributed over network so , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be calculated as following as in @xcite : @xmath12    by finding the derivative of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath6 to zero , we get the @xmath14 optimal number clusters as in @xcite .    @xmath15",
    "in this section , we present details of our beenish protocol .",
    "beenish implements the same concept as in deec , in terms of selecting ch which is based on residual energy level of the nodes with respect to average energy of network . however , deec is based on two types of nodes ; normal and advance nodes .",
    "beenish uses the concept of four types of nodes ; normal , advance , super and ultra - super nodes .",
    "let @xmath16 shows the rounds for a node @xmath17 to become ch , we refer it as rotating epoch .",
    "ch has to consume more energy as compare to member nodes . in homogeneous networks , to ensure average @xmath18 chs in each round , leach let every node @xmath19 to become ch once in every @xmath20 rounds . during operation of wsn all the nodes does not own the same remaining energy .",
    "so , if the epoch @xmath16 is kept equal for all nodes as in leach then energy is not efficiently distributed and nodes having low energy die before high energy nodes .",
    "beenish choose different epoch @xmath16 for different nodes with respect to their remaining energy @xmath21 .",
    "high energy nodes are more often elected as ch as compare to low energy nodes .",
    "so , high energy nodes have smaller epoch @xmath16 as compare to high energy nodes . in beenish ultra - super nodes",
    "are largely elected as ch as compare to super , advance and normal nodes , and so , on . in this way",
    "energy consumed by all nodes is equally distributed .",
    "let @xmath22 is probability of node to become ch during epoch @xmath16 rounds .",
    "when all the nodes have same every level at each epoch , selecting the average probability @xmath23 to be @xmath24 can ensure that there are @xmath18 chs every round and approximately all nodes die at the same time .",
    "if nodes are having different energy then nodes with more energy have @xmath23 larger than @xmath24 .    in beenish ,",
    "average energy of @xmath25 round can be obtained as follows and as supposed in deec :    @xmath26    @xmath27 is showing total rounds from the start of network to the all nodes die and can be estimated as in deec and given as under :    @xmath28    @xmath29 is the energy dissipated in a network during single round as given in 2 .    to achieve the optimal number of ch at start of each round",
    ", node @xmath17 decides whether to become a ch or not based on probability threshold calculated by expression in the following equation , and as supposed in @xcite .    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the set of nodes eligible to become ch .",
    "if a node @xmath17 has not been ch in the most recent @xmath16 then it belongs to set @xmath31 .",
    "random number between 0 and 1 is selected by nodes belonging to set @xmath31 .",
    "if the number is less than threshold @xmath32 , the node @xmath17 will be ch for that current round .",
    "in real scenarios , wsns have more greater than two or three energy levels of nodes . in wsn",
    "due to random ch selection , large range of energy levels are created .",
    "so , as much more energy levels we quantize and define different probability for every energy level will lead to as much better results and lead to energy efficiency . in beenish ,",
    "we first time use concept of four level heterogeneous network having normal , advance , super and ultra - super nodes .",
    "the probabilities for four types of nodes are given below :    @xmath33    threshold is calculated for ch selection of normal , advanced , super and ultra - super nodes by putting above values in equation below .",
    "@xmath34    in the equation of @xmath32 , we find that nodes with greater remaining energy @xmath35 at round @xmath36 are more possibly to become ch as compare to low energy nodes .",
    "the aim of this mechanism is to efficiently divide the energy consumption in the network and extend the stability period which is defined by first node die and network lifetime defined by last node die from the start of wsn .",
    "simulations show that beenish is more efficient protocol than deec , ddeec and edeec for wsn containing four and multi level heterogeneity in terms of first node die and last node die .",
    "this section evaluates the performance of beenish protocol using matlab .",
    "we consider a wsn containing of @xmath37 nodes randomly deployed inside @xmath38 field . for simplicity , we assume that all nodes are either fixed or micro - mobile and ignore energy loss due to signal collision and interference between signals of different nodes that are due to dynamic random channel conditions .",
    "our simulations use radio parameters mentioned in table 1 .",
    "protocols compared with beenish include deec , ddeec and edeec .",
    "we estimated performance for the case of four level and multi - level heterogeneous wsns . we observe performance of deec , ddeec , edeec and beenish for four level and multi - level heterogenous wsns .",
    "we take the parameters ; @xmath39 , containing @xmath40 normal nodes having @xmath41 energy , @xmath42 advanced nodes having @xmath43 times more energy than normal nodes , @xmath44 super nodes containing @xmath45 times more energy than normal nodes and @xmath46 ultra - super nodes containing @xmath47 times more energy than normal nodes .",
    "first node for deec , ddeec , edeec and beenish dies at 1103 , 1367 , 1421 and 1661 rounds , respectively .",
    "all nodes die at 5191 , 3976 , 6866 and 6903 rounds , respectively .",
    "3 shows beenish sends more data to bs than deec , ddeec and edeec .",
    "beenish is efficient as compare to all protocols in terms of stability period , network life time and packets sent to the bs .",
    "our proposed beenish is energy - aware clustering protocol for heterogenous wsns , with the concept of four types of nodes .",
    "election of ch based on residual and average energy of the network .",
    "so , nodes with high energy have more chances to get selected as ch , as compare to the low energy nodes .",
    "beenish is proved to be the most efficient protocols as compared to deed , ddeec and edeec for all types of wsns in terms of stability period , network lifetime and throughput .    1 qureshi , t.n . ; javaid , n. ; malik , m. ; qasim , u. ; khan , z.a . ,",
