    "<S> we investigate the polarization properties of comptonized x - rays from relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) using monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three scenarios commonly proposed for the observed x - ray emission in agn : compton scattering of blackbody photons emitted from an accretion disk ; scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ; and self - comptonization of intrinsically polarized synchrotron photons emitted by jet electrons . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that for comptonization of disk and cmb photons , the degree of polarization of the scattered photons increases with the viewing inclination angle with respect to the jet axis . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the maximum linear polarization is @xmath0 . in the case of synchrotron self - comptonization ( ssc ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the resulting x - ray polarization depends strongly on the seed synchrotron photon injection site , with typical fractional polarizations @xmath1 when synchrotron emission is localized near the jet base , while @xmath2 for the case of uniform emission throughout the jet . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that x - ray polarimetry may be capable of providing unique clues to identify the location of particle acceleration sites in relativistic jets . in particular , if synchrotron photons are emitted quasi - uniformly throughout a jet , then the observed degree of x - ray polarization may be sufficiently different for each of the competing x - ray emission mechanisms ( synchrotron , ssc or external comptonization ) to determine which is the dominant process . however , x - ray polarimetry alone is unlikely to be able to distinguish between disk and cmb comptonization .    </S>",
