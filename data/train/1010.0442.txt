    "all these processes can be thought of different kinds of quantum channels , decoherence inevitably affecting all of them .",
    "we are interested in assessing the deviation from ideality in gaussian channels , and the precision attainable when tested with gaussian resources .",
    "namely , we consider a dissipative thermal bath with mean photon number @xmath2 and damping constant @xmath3 , and explore how well different gaussian resources perform in identifying these parameters .",
    "our question is immediately relevant to the field of quantum information , since assessing the deviation from the _ identity channel _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ideal information transmitter , is the principal requirement to implement large scale quantum communication .",
    "the need for an efficient characterization of dissipation in continuous variable systems is becoming a requisite for a number of quantum information tasks , such as quantum repeaters  @xcite or quantum memories  @xcite , among others .",

    ", decoherence can be related to physical quantities of practical interest , _",
    "e.g. _ , photon loss is strongly related to impurity doping concentration in semiconductor lasers  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear magneto - optical effects  @xcite can be understood as photon loss , an effect with several technological applications such as low - field magnetometry and gas density measurements  @xcite . additionally , photon - photon scattering in vacuum is still an unobserved prediction of both quantum electrodynamics and non - standard models of elementary particles  @xcite .",
    "these are only a few among the several applications that involve the precise determination of losses in dispersive media .",
    "for this reason , we will pose our problem and formulate our results in a general theoretic formalism , in order to keep our results as general as possible .",
    "we address the problem of estimating the parameters of a gaussian channel describing the dynamics of a bosonic mode @xmath4 , coupled with strength @xmath3 to a thermal reservoir with mean photon number @xmath2 . in the interaction picture , and within the markovian approximation ( at any time the mode and the bath remain unentangled ) , the completely positive dynamics and the action on the mode @xmath4 is described by the superoperator @xmath5+(n+1)l[a]\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath6\\rho=2o\\rho o^\\dagger - o^\\dagger o \\rho-\\rho o^\\dagger o$ ] . for convenience",

    "a collective measurement @xmath12 is finally performed . ]",
    "previous related work in the literature addresses the problem of estimating a state within a gaussian family in several different situations . among others we should mention the works of yuen & lax  @xcite , helstrom  @xcite , holevo  @xcite , hayashi  @xcite , adesso & chiribella  @xcite and hayashi & matsumoto  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these works focus on estimating some of all possible parameters of a gaussian state .",
    "most of them focus on estimating either displacement or temperature for fixed degrees of squeezing , while others consider the degree of squeezing in a vacuum state .",
    "no work exists , to the best of our knowledge , that addresses the problem of estimating _ all _ parameters of a gaussian state .",
    "if such a work would exist , the problem of estimating a gaussian channel with gaussian probe states would reduce to a subproblem of the former .",
    "however , the lack of such a general result demands a dedicated solution .    the setup that we consider is quite generic .",
    "we allow for _ i ) _ extending the channel of interest to include an ancillary mode @xmath13 , unaffected by the channel ( _ i.e. _ , identity superoperator @xmath14 ) , obtaining the channel @xmath15 , _ ii ) _ choosing any bipartite gaussian state @xmath16 , of which @xmath10 copies will be sent through the channel and _ iii ) _ performing a generalized measurement @xmath17 [ characterized by a povm @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , on the collective state @xmath21 .",

    "two extreme cases , where one only cares about one or the other parameter can be accounted for by the choices @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this approach allows also to define strategies where one is only interested in a particular linear combination of the parameters @xmath33 , by setting @xmath34 . with these considerations , and given a large number @xmath10 of copies of the fixed probe state @xmath16 , one can ask what is the smallest possible value of @xmath35 $ ] that is allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics .    the main question we wish to answer is the following : to what extent can one optimize expression   by using different gaussian resources ?",
    "more precisely , we will compare the performance of thermal , coherent , single - mode squeezed and two - mode squeezed vacuum in estimating the damping @xmath3 and the temperature @xmath2 at different parameter regimes , comparing the performance of each probe state at equal amount of energy input to the channel , @xmath36 $ ] . in order to elucidate the role that each one of these resources plays in the estimation problem",
    ", we will make some simplifying assumptions .",
    "namely , we will not consider the combination of different resources , e.g. two - mode squeezing and displacement .",
    "a priori it would seem that the problem may have several different variants depending on the chosen cost function ( or @xmath37 matrix ) .",
    "we will see , however , that some general statements can be made .",
    "anticipating the results that will be presented in the present work , we will prove that :    1 .",
    "choosing a two - mode squeezed vacuum input state @xmath16 , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be optimally estimated _",
    "simultaneously_. that is , no compromise is required in the optimization of @xmath38 .",
    "this holds true even when the optimal measurements for @xmath3 and @xmath2 do not commute .",
    "2 .   for both parameters",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath2 , and at any given energy , two - mode squeezed states always outperform any other class of gaussian states .",
    "the combination of these two statements unveals a strong compatibility between the problem of estimating the damping @xmath3 and the temperature @xmath2 in the gaussian setting . in section  [ sec : holevo ]",
    "we develop our approach and derive the first result of our paper , namely , that optimal precision with two - mode squeezed states can be attained simultaneously for both parameters , thus allowing to divide the problem of computing precision bounds into two independent problems .",
    "sections [ sec : gamma ] and [ sec : n ] explore the precision bounds for estimating @xmath3 and @xmath2 individually , comparing the performances of different gaussian resources , focusing especially on some physically relevant regimes of the parameters . in section",
    "[ sec : nong ] we move on to explore numerically the non - gaussian arena and compare the relative performances with respect to gaussian probes .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] concludes the paper with a discussion and an overview of the obtained results .",
    "details of the technical proofs are provided in two appendices .",
    "the heisenberg relations place a fundamental limit on the precision with which one can measure any given observable .",
    "when it comes to quantities not associated to an observable , as is our case , it is necessary to resort to quantum estimation theory , which studies the fundamental quantum mechanical limits to the precision of measurements in a variety of situations .",
    "a first lower bound can be obtained from helstrom s fisher information matrix  @xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 $ ] is defined as the covariance matrix of the _ symmetric logarithmic derivatives _ ( sld ) @xmath41 fulfilling @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "the inherent non - commutativity of quantum mechanics forbids , in general , to attain this inequality when the problem is multi - parametric , as in our case . optimizing the measurement for one parameter will in general compromise the measurement precision on the others .",
    "when considering single - parameter estimation problems , it is well known that local adaptive measurements attain eq .",
    "however , even if the optimal measurements for both parameters do not commute , it may still be possible to devise a measurement strategy to attain simultaneously both bounds .",
    "recent progress in the theory of local asymptotic normality for quantum states  @xcite suggests that equality in eq .",
    "is asymptotically attainable if and only if  @xcite , @xmath44=0.\\ ] ]    the sld s for our problem , as well as in more general contexts , were obtained by the authors in  @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ sec : commute ] we prove eq .   for the case of two - mode squeezed vacuum probe states .",
    "the implications of eq .",
    "are two - fold . on one hand , it allows to prove that asymptotically , the estimation problems for both parameters become independent , so that they can be analyzed separately",
    ". this will be the subject of the two next sections .",
    "on the other hand , we will show that two - mode squeezed states form the optimal gaussian class of states . as a consequence",
    ", we will prove the existence of and provide the explicit expression of precision bounds for the simultaneous estimation of @xmath3 and @xmath2 for error cost functions that have diagonal @xmath37 matrices .",
    "the single - parameter precision is quantified by the asymptotic standard deviation , @xmath45},\\ ] ] which is bounded by the quantum fisher information .",
    "the latter will be generically denoted as @xmath46 or @xmath47 depending whether we are considering the yield for parameter @xmath3 or @xmath2 , respectively . when no confusion arises , we will omit the subscript .",
    "when we are referring to a particular yield of qfi , specific to a given class of states , we will denote it with the corresponding subscript @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for coherent , thermal , single - mode squeezed and two - mode squeezed vacuum states , respectively .",
    "precision bounds are then given by @xmath52 we will call @xmath53 the _ yield _ , or _",
    "performance_.    the obtained results should be interpreted in the following way .",
    "the two single - parameter problems have , as optimal observables the corresponding sld s  @xcite , which can be explicitly computed from  @xcite and are quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "in the multiparametric case , with diagonal @xmath37 matrices , the bounds obtained in the following two sections provide all necessary quantities needed to determine the asymptotic error cost .",
    "the optimal measurement , however , will require a general collective measurement , which is likely to be beyond the technical capabilities of present - day technology .",
    "we will focus on the theoretical attainable precision and not discuss the details of the implementation of the optimal observables .",
    "this will , nevertheless , provide a means to gauge the efficiency of more applied studies such as tomographic  @xcite , single - mode gaussian  @xcite and non - gaussian  @xcite , or entanglement - assisted schemes  @xcite .    in order to determine the precision attainable with different gaussian resources we consider single - mode probes parameterized as @xmath54 where @xmath55 , is a single - mode thermal state , @xmath56 [ @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the first moments and covariance matrix of the single - mode states ( @xmath59 ) are given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 while the energy in the probe is given by @xmath62    using the results of  @xcite it is easy to obtain the yield in fisher information as a function of the final parameters for both the single- and two - mode probe states .",
    "the yields for single - mode probes are    [ eq : singlemode ] @xmath63    expressed as functions of the state parameters after the action of the channel @xmath64 . in order to obtain the final values for the yield",
    ", one needs to consider the three different situations , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and substitute in eqs .  .",
    "turning to entangled probe states , we know from  @xcite that the optimal state for constraints of the form @xmath68\\leq n$ ] can only be pure .",
    "since we are interested in evaluating the sensitivity of the different gaussian resources , and two - mode squeezing is the only genuinely entangling resource , we will restrict ourselves to two - mode squeezed vacuum states , that we will denote by @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the two - mode vacuum .",
    "@xmath72 denotes the two - mode squeezing operator , where @xmath13 is the ancillary mode .",
    "notice that we consistently denote parameters in the probe state with the subscript @xmath73 . the covariance matrix for the two - mode squeezed state is @xmath74",
    "whereas the energy reads @xmath75 for the two - mode entangled state .",
    "we will consistently use @xmath76 to compare the performances of the different classes of states .",
    "we now proceed to analyze the problem of estimating @xmath3 alone , under the assumption that the mean photon number @xmath2 is known .",
    "this problem has been partially addressed in the literature @xcite with different degrees of generality . in previous studies ,",
    "emphasis is placed in zero temperature channels ( @xmath77 ) . in @xcite",
    "several distinct probe states are considered , always with fixed tomographic measurements @xmath78 and @xmath79 , whereas  @xcite focus their attention in the optimal probe states , respectively within the single - mode gaussian states and non - gaussian states . moreover , while  @xcite considers the use of entangled probes , no consideration is made about the optimality of the measurement scheme . on the other hand , references @xcite consider optimality of both measurement and single - mode probe states , but they do not consider the use of entangled probes . in this section",
    "we will combine both approaches , namely , considering different gaussian resources , including entanglement , while still using the powerful tools of quantum estimation theory in order to take into account the corresponding optimal measurement for each probe state .",
    "the yield for two - mode squeezed probe states as a function of the final state parameters is a highly involved expression which provides no physical insight . remarkably , plugging in the dependence of the final parameters as functions of the initial mean - photon number and the channel parameters provides manageable expressions , reported in appendix  [ app : exact ] along with the yields for single - mode states .",
    "notice that in both cases , two - mode squeezing is taken at fixed phase .",
    "this does not affect the generality of the analysis since single- and two - mode squeezing along different quadratures can always be taken to the standard forms   and by means of single - mode phase shifts .",
    "the phase insensitivity of the considered channels guarantees that this will not affect the yield in fisher information .",
    "we thus proceed to compare the different resources by writing the output parameters as functions of the initial ones  @xcite , which in turn are functions of the available energy .",
    "the resulting general expressions are exceedingly complex and provide no particular physical insight .",
    "we will , instead , explore specific parameter regimes of physical interest . in order to present the forthcoming results in a manageable form",
    ", we will use , when convenient , the following definitions ,    @xmath80            as a first approach and in order to put our results in context with previous related studies @xcite we analyze the limiting case of baths at zero temperature .",
    "zero - temperature baths are the most commonly encountered in quantum optics , and to which most of the existing literature is dedicated . under the assumption that @xmath77 , the general expressions obtained in appendix  [ app : exact ] reduce to    [ eq : zeron ] @xmath81    it is easy to verify that @xmath51 is the largest of all these quantities .",
    "the relations @xmath82 are obvious . on the other hand",
    "the relation @xmath83 only requires to observe that @xmath84 .",
    "a characteristic feature that we will encounter later on with greater generality is the fact that both thermal and single - mode squeezed states saturate their performance when @xmath76 is large [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : zeron ] ] . on the other hand , the performance of coherent and two - mode squeezed states grows linearly with @xmath76 .",
    "this clearly leaves the latter as the two candidates for optimality when @xmath76 is large .",
    "a relevant question is when does the performance of one become _ much _",
    "larger than the other s ?",
    "as will be seen , two - mode squeezed vacuum states perform always better than coherent ones . on the other hand , it is easy to see that the increase in performance of two - mode squeezed states is most relevant when @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , since then @xmath87 .",
    "this increase in performance is independent of the amount of energy in the probe state .",
    "this can be observed also from fig .",
    "[ fig : zeron ] .",
    "we now turn to the most general situation where the thermal bath has nonzero temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ photons can _ leak into _ the quantum system additionally to _ leaking out _ from it .",
    "we consider the two interesting parameter regimes with practical relevance , namely , that of low - energy probes and that of high energy probes .",
    "the former is best suited for situations where the properties of the channel ( bath ) under inspection are sensitive to the effect of intrusive probing .",
    "it is worth stressing that in some cases , the gain by using a small amount of energy may not provide a substantial gain w.r.t . the performance of the vacuum .",
    "on the other hand , there are situations where the choice of the probe state critically determines the attainable accuracy .",
    "we wish to identify those situations .    in the low energy regime ( @xmath88 )",
    "we perform the taylor expansion @xmath89 where obviously @xmath90 is independent of the kind of state being considered , and corresponds to the performance of the vacuum . the common leading constant is thus given by @xmath91 corrections of order @xmath76 contribute with coefficients    @xmath92    where we have defined @xmath93 .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first of all , notice from eq .   that the yield for coherent states is a polynomial of first degree in @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 gives the exact expression . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal correction @xmath95 is always negative , which implies that weak thermal fields perform worse than the vacuum [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fisher_gamma ]  ( left ) ] .    the first question to ask is when do coherent states provide any significant improvement over the vacuum . for this",
    "we consider the condition @xmath96 .",
    "this reduces to @xmath97    on the other hand , the same condition for two - mode squeezed probe states @xmath98 , reduces to @xmath99 notice that for moderate values of @xmath2 and large values of @xmath3 ( @xmath100 ) eqs .   and reduce to @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively , which shows that the regime required for eq .",
    "is entered earlier than that of eq .   for increasing @xmath103 .",
    "in the limit of small losses ( @xmath104 ) , we can expand eqs .   and to zeroth order in @xmath103 to obtain , for @xmath96 @xmath105 whereas for @xmath98 we get @xmath106 the condition for @xmath98 thus reduces to @xmath107 .",
    "notice that this is not a sufficient condition to achieve a significant improvement using coherent probes [ eq .  ] .    on the other hand",
    ", one can see that @xmath86 ( that is , @xmath104 ) with moderate @xmath2 ( @xmath108 ) implies @xmath109 .",
    "this means that at moderate temperatures , and with low energy in the probe state , two - mode squeezed states significantly outperform coherent states in the regime of small losses .",
    "high energy probes are of interest when the channel being probed is not as delicate , or needs not be preserved .",
    "a natural instance of this situation is in probing the photon - photon scattering predicted by qed and non - standard models of elementary particles .",
    "the high energy regime has a substantially different behavior .",
    "expanding the relevant yield functions from appendix  [ app : exact ] in inverse powers of @xmath76 we obtain series of the form @xmath110 in some cases @xmath111 will vanish , rendering the corresponding class of states useless compared to those for which @xmath111 does not vanish .",
    "explicitly , we have    @xmath112    the first relevant fact to notice is that , contrary to the low energy regime , different gaussian resources perform differently in the limit of large energy .",
    "this is hardly a surprise .",
    "we observe that the asymptotic performance is bounded for thermal and single - mode squeezed states .",
    "this is in contrast to the fact that single - mode squeezed states have proven highly efficient for other precision measurements such as optical phase  @xcite and magnetometry  @xcite , among others . on the other hand , coherent and two - mode squeezed states provide an unbounded yield , as is manifest by the nonvanishing @xmath111 terms , giving a linear growth in @xmath46 with increasing @xmath76 .",
    "this makes the constant zeroth order correction irrelevant .",
    "a very important difference between coherent states and two - mode squeezed states becomes readily apparent . while for coherent states",
    ", the _ rate _ of growth of @xmath111 is bounded , for two - mode squeezed states it is not .",
    "in particular , the difference between the two yields becomes most significant when @xmath113 and negligible when @xmath114 .",
    "this is certainly relevant for detecting very small damping parameters , for which the inverse dependence in @xmath103 may even be sufficient to overcome the practical limitations of achieving very high @xmath76 values .",
    "quantum thermometry has become a subject of high physical relevance with the advent of ultracold atomic gases  @xcite . at low temperatures , new methods",
    "need to be envisaged to determine the magnitude of thermal fluctuations in atomic clouds . in this section",
    "we analyze the quantum - limited precision bounds to the estimation of temperature ( mean photon number @xmath2 ) in a bosonic thermal bath , coupled to a probe system prepared in a gaussian state , with the coupling strength not necessarily large , _",
    "i.e. _ , far from thermalization .    a straightforward method to measure temperature is to let the probe system coupled to the bath to thermalize .",
    "quadrature measurements then provide an estimator of the mean photon number , providing in turn an estimator of the bath temperature .",
    "this approach has several drawbacks .",
    "most importantly , it requires in general a large coupling constant @xmath115 , in order to reach the steady state",
    ". however , there may be situations where the coupling constant can not be chosen at will .",
    "on the other hand , this does not necessarily provide the optimal estimation accuracy .",
    "as we will see , two - mode squeezed states can outperform the sensitivity of the vacuum state or other classes of gaussian states , for any value of the parameters .",
    "contrary to the effect of the decay parameter @xmath3 , that affects both first and second moments , the temperature in the bath only affects the second moments .",
    "first moments evolve independently of the bath temperature  @xcite .",
    "this has immediate consequences for the sensitivity of coherent states , which will perform equivalently to the vacuum state .",
    "thus , we will not consider coherent probe states in this section .",
    "we will follow the same approach taken in the previous section , by addressing different energy regimes in the probe states .         as in the case for @xmath46 , @xmath47",
    "will be limited to a constant value corresponding to the sensitivity of the vacuum state @xmath90 at small values of @xmath76 . however , since first moments are unaffected by the temperature of the bath , the yield of coherent states will equal that of the vacuum .",
    "as in the previous section , we will expand @xmath47 in powers of @xmath76 , in order to obtain and analyze the low - energy yield for each class of states , @xmath116 taking the expressions from appendix  [ app : exact ] we get @xmath117 to which corrections of order @xmath76 contribute with factors    @xmath118    where we have defined @xmath119 .",
    "it is immediate to observe that @xmath120 which implies that , similarly to the situation for @xmath46 , small thermal fluctuations in the probe state can only be detrimental . on the other hand ,",
    "the small @xmath76 correction for single - mode squeezed states has no unambiguously defined sign , the latter being positive only when @xmath121 .",
    "solving the inequality @xmath122 for @xmath103 we obtain @xmath123 the right hand side is positive only when @xmath124 , which means that only for @xmath125 it is possible to have a gain in yield by using single - mode squeezed probes .",
    "we thus conclude that for @xmath126 the best single - mode probe ( at low energies , @xmath88 ) is the vacuum state .",
    "however , if the bath temperature is sufficiently high [ @xmath125 ] , it is possible to improve the sensitivity of the vacuum by single - mode squeezing .",
    "we now turn to analyze the yield of two - mode squeezed states . as can be readily seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : fisher_n ] and [ fig : fisher_n2 ] , the behavior is rather simple .",
    "the slope at small values of @xmath76 is always positive and , moreover , as follows from the relations in appendix  [ app : exact ] , always larger than that of single - mode squeezed states . imposing that @xmath128 yields @xmath129 .",
    "since the right hand side is greater than unity , we have @xmath130 and , given that @xmath76 is small , it follows that @xmath2 has to be large .",
    "therefore we can reduce the condition to @xmath131 , which is never satisfied for small @xmath76 .",
    "we thus conclude that low energy entangled probes always outperform single - mode ones , for any regime of the parameters , although the improvement can not always be of significant magnitude ( @xmath128 can not be achieved for small @xmath76 values ) .",
    "most remarkably , two - mode squeezed states are the only class of gaussian states that perform better than the vacuum for any values of the parameters .",
    "the high energy limit for @xmath47 is quite uninteresting .",
    "the reason being that all yields saturate , and no significant improvement can be achieved using two - mode squeezed probes as compared to the use of coherent states .",
    "the limiting expressions read , to order @xmath132 @xmath133 we have presented the second order term for @xmath49 because it is the leading one .",
    "the yield , however , tends to vanish , as can be expected by observing that in the limit of a highly energetic probe , the thermal fluctuations in the probe are infinitely larger than those induced by the bath , and therefore no inference about the latter can be obtained .",
    "single- and two - mode squeezed states have nonzero limiting yields , but , as anticipated , the yield saturates for highly energetic probes .",
    "it is easy to check that in the limit @xmath134 we have @xmath135 but no order can be established between the vacuum state and single - mode squeezed states .",
    "a crossover can occur between the performances for the vacuum and single - mode squeezed states depending on the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "concentrating on the asymptotic yield , a natural question is to understand in what situations does two - mode squeezing perform much better than the vacuum state .",
    "this is simple to answer by observing that @xmath136 so that if @xmath137 ( in the high @xmath76 limit ) then @xmath138 .",
    "this condition is likely to occur in several practical situations , for channels close to ideal , _ i.e. _ , when the decay rate @xmath3 is very low and the temperature is low or moderate .",
    "notice that this is not the first time that we encounter this condition for a significant improvement of squeezed states over coherent ones .",
    "all results indicate that whenever there is an improvement of two - mode squeezed states over the vacuum , it is always in the limit of small coupling to the bath ( @xmath86 , i.e. , a close to ideal channel ) .",
    "so far we have seen that , in order to optimally estimate the channel parameters in eq .  , two - mode squeezing is the most effective resource within the arena of gaussian inputs .",
    "this fact suggests two immediate questions .",
    "_ 1 ) _ is there a direct relation between entanglement and the performance in channel estimation ? and _ 2 ) _ are there non - gaussian states outperforming the squeezed vacuum for the same energy supply ?",
    "questions similar to _ 1 ) _ have arisen previously in the literature , both in the finite dimensional case  @xcite and in the continuous variable one ( albeit in somewhat different setups  @xcite ) , considering different kinds of channels .",
    "question _ 2 ) _ has been also addressed in the context of quantum channel estimation  @xcite , and regarding the performance in other quantum information tasks , especially continuous - variable quantum teleportation  @xcite .    with the available techniques it is difficult to give a precise _ quantitative _ answer , since numerical techniques are not well - suited to deal with infinite dimensional systems , and analytic control methods are not yet well developed beyond the gaussian regime .",
    "the difficulty with numerical methods resides in the fact that hilbert - space truncation is rendered useless at @xmath139 , because thermal baths immediately populate all levels in fock space , thus rendering a direct numerical approach futile , or , in the best of all cases , a rude approximation . in order to address the question of sensitivity of",
    "non - gaussian states for parameter estimation , techniques beyond those developed so far are needed , and it is beyond the scope of this work to pursue them .",
    "instead , we will provide a simple _ qualitative _ answer by restricting the channels of interest to those at zero temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath77 . in this case , populated levels in fock space only decay to lower energy levels and hilbert - space truncation provides exact numerical results .",
    "we have computed numerically the quantum fisher information @xmath46 at @xmath140 for @xmath141 states picked from @xmath142 constituting the subspace with at most 3 photons in each mode , randomly distributed according to the @xmath143 haar measure . in fig .",
    "[ fig : random ] we report our findings .",
    "the left plot displays the values of @xmath46 against the mean photon number in mode @xmath4 , and the right plot displays the _ efficiency _ ( _",
    "i.e. _ , the ratio @xmath144 ) against the entropy of entanglement @xmath145 .",
    "along with the random states we display the results for maximally entangled states within the cutoff @xmath146 and the two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "our findings reveal that most states have a very high performance in relation to the amount of energy they have in the channel mode .",
    "in particular , for a fixed dimension cutoff the more entangled the states are , the better they perform on average .",
    "in particular , the maximally entangled state attains the bound set by the squeezed vacuum .",
    "it is of course interesting to ask how does the performance change when one introduces temperature in the channel .",
    "this is beyond the capabilities of numerical methods relying on dimensional cutoff , and more advanced methods would need to be envisaged .",
    "we have obtained the sharp precision bounds on estimation of @xmath3 and @xmath2 for four classes of gaussian states , namely , coherent , thermal , single - mode squeezed vacuum and two - mode squeezed vacuum .",
    "we have shown that the two - mode squeezed vacuum always outperforms any other class of gaussian states .",
    "the improvement of two - mode squeezed vacuum states versus coherent states is most relevant when the coupling parameter @xmath3 is weak . in particular , at zero or finite temperature , the yield @xmath46 of two - mode squeezed states increases much faster with @xmath76 than the yield of coherent states at small values of @xmath3 . for @xmath47 , comparing the yield of two - mode squeezed vacuum states versus the yield of the vacuum , we find that , for small values of @xmath76 , no significant improvement can be obtained .",
    "the situation changes dramatically in the high energy regime , where , despite a saturation of the yield ( all yields saturate to a maximum value ) , saturation occurs at much higher yields when @xmath147 . summarizing",
    ", we have shown that two - mode squeezed vacuum always outperforms any other gaussian resource for both estimation problems ( @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) , and we have identified the situations in which this improvement is most significant .",
    "we have also provided numerical evidence that the squeezed vacuum state provides an upper bound to the performance of arbitrary states with dimensional cutoff .",
    "this suggests a deeper analysis , and the causes for this optimality should be investigated .",
    "turning to the multiparametric problem of simultaneously estimating both parameters of the channel , we have shown that the optimal state ( two - mode squeezed vacuum ) provides optimal sensitivity for both parameters , and that in the many - copy limit ( @xmath148 ) a collective measurement exists which saturates both bounds simultaneously , as a consequence of eq .  .",
    "these results imply that the problems of estimating @xmath3 and @xmath2 enjoy a strong form of compatibility .",
    "not only the optimal probe state is common to both problems , but also the corresponding optimal measurements commute in the asymptotic limit .",
    "therefore an overall protocol optimizing both tasks can be envisaged ( in the asymptotic @xmath148 limit ) .",
    "it is a relevant question to determine whether lifting the restriction to gaussian states can provide an increased performance , and whether such kind of compatibility remains true in the more general setting involving arbitrary probe states .",
