    "the neutron skin thickness of nuclei is defined as the difference between the root mean square radius of neutrons and protons , @xmath8 the extraction of neutron radii and neutron skins from the experiment is in general dependent on the shape of the neutron distribution used in the analysis @xcite .",
    "the data typically do not indicate unambiguosly if the difference between the peripheral neutron and proton densities is caused by an extended bulk radius of the neutron density , by a modification of the width of the surface , or by some combination of both effects .",
    "in particular , the neutron skin @xmath0 of @xmath1pb is nowadays attracting significant interest in both experiment and theory since it has a close relation with the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and with the equation of state of neutron - rich matter @xcite , which have a large impact in diverse problems of nuclear physics and astrophysics where neutron - rich matter is involved @xcite .",
    "the analysis of bulk and surface contributions to the neutron skin thickness of a nucleus requires proper definitions of these quantities based on nuclear density distributions @xcite . using the standard definitions of the equivalent sharp radius @xmath9 and surface width parameter @xmath10 of a nucleon density profile , we have shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that one can write @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 we recall that @xmath14 stands for the radius of a uniform sharp distribution whose density equals the bulk value of the actual density and that has the same number of particles .",
    "therefore , one has a natural splitting of @xmath0 in terms of a bulk part ( [ rb ] ) independent of surface properties , and a part ( [ rs ] ) of surface origin @xcite .",
    "nonrelativistic ( nrmf ) and relativistic ( rmf ) mean field models often differ in their predictions for properties of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "a common example is the value predicted for the density slope @xmath15 of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density , which may show large discrepancies in the mf interactions .",
    "the @xmath15 parameter is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the symmetry energy and @xmath18 the nuclear saturation density .",
    "linear correlation of @xmath0 of @xmath1pb with the density slope of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath15 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath15 of the bulk and surface contributions defined in eqs .",
    "( [ rb ] ) and ( [ rs ] ) is also displayed . ]    in figure [ fig2 ] we show the linear correlation of @xmath0 of @xmath1pb with the parameter @xmath15 and demonstrate that it mainly arises from the bulk part of @xmath0 within a large and representative set of mean field models of very different nature .",
    "relativistic ( rmf ) models : g2 , nlc , nl - sh , tm1 , nl - ra1 , nl3 , nl3 * , nl - z , nl1 , dd - me2 and fsugold ; and nonrelativistic ( nrmf ) models : hfb-8 , msk7 , d1s , sgii , d1n , sk - t6 , hfb-17 , sly4 , skm * , sksm * , skmp , ska , sk - rs and sk - t4 .",
    "the original references to the different interactions can be found in @xcite for the skyrme models , @xcite for the gogny models , and @xcite and ref .  [",
    "19 ] in @xcite for the rmf models . from this figure",
    ", one sees that whereas the bulk contribution to the neutron skin thickness of @xmath2pb changes largely among the different mean - field interactions , the surface contribution remains confined to a narrow band of values .",
    "the shape of the neutron density is more uncertain than the proton density in @xmath1pb , and even if the neutron rms radius is determined ( _ e.g. _ in prex @xcite ) , it can correspond to different shapes of the neutron density . as discussed in @xcite , from the study of the two - parameter fermi functions fitted to the self - consistent densities of the mf models , we find that for @xmath2pb the central radii @xmath19 vary within the windows @xmath20 fm in nrmf and @xmath21 fm in rmf , @xmath22 fm in nrmf and @xmath23 fm in rmf , and that the diffuseness parameters @xmath24 vary within the windows @xmath25 fm in nrmf and @xmath26 fm in rmf and @xmath27 fm . from these results",
    ", we can conclude that most of the mf models predict a neutron distribution for @xmath1pb between the halo - type limit ( where @xmath28 ) and the skin - type limit ( where @xmath29 ) .",
    "the halo - type is supported by models with a very soft symmetry energy .",
    "models with a stiffer symmetry energy ( larger @xmath15 values ) have @xmath30 more and more different from zero .",
    "however , a pure skin - type is not found in any mean - field model as @xmath31 is always non - vanishing .",
    "parity violating asymmetry ( dwba ) in @xmath1pb for 1  gev electrons at @xmath32 scattering angle .",
    "mf results and those obtained with the parametrized formula given in the text . ]",
    "parity - violating electron scattering ( pves ) probes the neutron density in a nucleus since the @xmath33 boson couples mainly to neutrons @xcite .",
    "the prex experiment at jlab @xcite aims to determine the neutron rms radius of @xmath1pb by pves .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of pves on the shape of the neutron and proton densities of @xmath1pb within the mf models . to this end , we compute the parity - violating asymmetry @xmath34 at the prex kinematics @xcite .",
    "we obtain the differentical cross sections @xmath35 for right and left - handed electrons by performing the exact phase shift analysis ( dbwa ) of the dirac equation @xcite for incident electrons moving in the potentials @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "[ fig4 ] the results for @xmath37 as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the two parameter fermi distributions fitted to the @xmath1pb mf densities .",
    "we have found that the results can be reasonably parametrized by the formula @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath41 , which is depicted by the crosses in the figure .",
    "recently , in @xcite we have analyzed systematically the correlations of @xmath37 with the neutron skin thickness of @xmath1pb and with the slope of the symmetry energy in the nuclear mf models .",
    "we have found that the known linear correlation of @xmath0 of @xmath1pb with the density derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy arises from the bulk part of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that an experimental determination of @xmath43 of @xmath1pb could be as useful for constraining @xmath15 as a determination of @xmath44 .",
    "mf models can accomodate the halo - type distribution in @xmath1pb if the symmetry energy is very soft but do not support a purely skin - type distribution .",
    "we find a simple parametrization of @xmath37 in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath31 that would provide a new correlation between the central radius and the surface diffuseness of the distribution of neutrons in @xmath1pb assuming the proton density known from experiment .",
