    "high - speed solar wind streams ( hsss ) play an important role in space weather at earth .",
    "recurrent geomagnetic storms are strongly associated with hsss ( @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) , as are high - energy electrons in the earth s magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "hsss emanate from coronal holes on the sun and form corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) with enhanced densities and magnetic field strengths @xcite .",
    "the most severe geomagnetic storms are caused by coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) that occur frequently during times of high solar activity .",
    "the interplanetary propagation of cmes is strongly influenced by the interaction with the ambient solar wind flow , which can either accelerate or decelerate the cme ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . to estimate the potential geoeffectiveness of cmes as well as their arrival time at the earth , information on their speed and propagation direction as well as on the ambient solar wind flow is needed .",
    "therefore , knowledge of the background solar wind is a key ingredient in the framework of space weather forecasting .",
    "measurements of the background solar wind conditions are only available for a few points in the heliosphere , _",
    "e.g. _ measurements from ace and _ wind _ , which are located at lagrangian point l@xmath0 at @xmath11  au in the sun  earth line , about one hour upstream of the earth . to gain information on the background solar wind distribution between the earth and the sun , we need to rely on numerical mhd modeling or on empirical relationships ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical solar wind models typically simulate the heliosphere in the distance range from about 20  r@xmath2 to 2  au and provide simulations of solar wind parameters such as speed , density , temperature , and magnetic field strength .",
    "the solar wind models are constantly improved and updated by the code developers .",
    "validation and testing of the model performance is an important step in further improving the models in order to ensure an accurate description of our space environment .",
    "solar wind models can be tested by comparing the model output at the location of a spacecraft to actual _ in - situ _ measurements from the spacecraft .",

    "these authors found a good model performance for large - scale structures and a systematic time offset for these models of about two days .",
    "in another recent study , @xcite compared the solar wind models mas / enlil and wsa / enlil with _ in - situ _ measurements from ace for carrington rotations ( crs ) 19992038 ( 24 january 200318 january 2006 ) . to this end , the data were extracted from the simulation output in the ecliptic plane at a fixed distance to the sun ( 1  au ) .",

    "@xcite compared mas / enlil and wsa / enlil model results with observations at ace and ulysses for crs 20162018 when ace and ulysses were in latitudinal alignment .",
    "the alignment made it possible to compare the model results for the same time and latitude but for different distances ( 1  au and 5.4  au ) to the sun .",
    "these authors found that for the two - stream interaction regions during crs 20162018 the models are able to simulate field polarities , sector boundaries , and the occurrence and features of stream - interaction regions .",
    "however , the simulated arrival times of these structures were off by about two days .    in this article , we present an evaluation of the solar wind models mas / mas , mas / enlil , and wsa / enlil during a time period when solar activity was exremely low ( year  2007 ) . for the prediction of transit times of cmes from the sun and their impact speed at earth , background solar wind models that produce accurate results on time scales less than one day are needed .",
    "therefore , we compared the model results with _ in - situ _ measurements at the exact location of the spacecraft on timescales of several hours to days .",
    "today , the approach for heliospheric modeling is the use of coupled models , where the simulations of the corona are separated from the simulations of the heliosphere .",
    "the coronal part of the model uses magnetic synoptic maps as input parameter and extrapolates it to a source surface at typically 2.5  r@xmath2 . the synoptic maps are built up from line - of - sight measurements of the sun s photospheric magnetic field over the course of a solar rotation . from the source surface at 2.5",

    "the wsa model @xcite is a semi - empirical model that relates the expansion factor of magnetic flux tubes in the corona to solar wind speeds at 1  au .",
    "it is based on the findings of @xcite that high - speed solar wind streams are correlated with low magnetic flux tube expansions between the photosphere and the corona . for the computation of the coronal magnetic field up to 2.5  r@xmath2 the potential - field source - surface model ( pfss : * ? ? ?",

    "<S> knowledge about the background solar wind plays a crucial role in the framework of space weather forecasting . _ in - situ _ measurements of the background solar wind are only available for a few points in the heliosphere where spacecraft are located , therefore we have to rely on heliospheric models to derive the distribution of solar wind parameters in interplanetary space . </S>",
    "<S> we test the performance of different solar wind models , namely magnetohydrodynamic algorithm outside a sphere / enlil ( mas / enlil ) , wang  sheeley  arge / enlil ( wsa / enlil ) , and mas / mas , by comparing model results with _ in - situ _ measurements from spacecraft located at 1  au distance to the sun ( ace , _ wind _ ) . to exclude the influence of interplanetary coronal mass ejections ( icmes ) , we chose the year 2007 as a time period with low solar activity for our comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the general structure of the background solar wind is well reproduced by all models . </S>",
    "<S> the best model results were obtained for the parameter solar wind speed . </S>",
    "<S> however , the predicted arrival times of high - speed solar wind streams have typical uncertainties of the order of about one  day . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of model runs with synoptic magnetic maps from different observatories revealed that the choice of the synoptic map significantly affects the model performance .    </S>",
