    "photoionization of atoms in bichromatic laser field had received recently a considerable attention both in theory ( see , for instance , baranova _ et al _ 1990 , 1992 , 1993 , baranova and zeldovich 1991 , szke _ et al _ 1991 , anderson _",
    "et al _ 1992 , schafer and kulander 1992 , potvliege and smith 1991 , 1992a , b , 1994 , pazdzersky and yurovsky 1994 , protopapas _ et al _ 1994 , vniard _ et al _ 1995 , pazdzersky and usachenko 1997 , fifirig _ et al _ 1997 ) and experiment ( muller _ et al _ 1990 , ce chen and elliott 1990 , baranova _ et al _ 1991 , 1992 , yin _ et al _ 1992 ) .",
    "one of the principal points of interest seems to be dependence of the observables on the difference of field phases @xmath2 , i.e. the problem of _ phase control_. another important aspect is the angular ( polar ) asymmetry of photoionization rate .",
    "these effects are interrelated since polar asymmetry is @xmath2-dependent and vanishes for some particular value of phase ( see more detail below ) .",
    "the calculations have been carried out previously for ionization of hydrogen atom in two laser fields with a frequency ratio 1:2 ( schafer and kulander 1992 ) , 1:3 ( potvliege and smith 1991 ) and 2:3 ( potvliege and smith 1994 ) .",
    "potvliege and smith ( 1992 ) presented results for various frequency ratios and initial states .",
    "different schemes were employed , but all of them implied numerically intensive work .    for the multiphoton electron detachment from negative ions some analytical treatment exists ( baranova _",
    "et al _ 1993 , pazdzersky and yurovsky 1994 , pazdzersky and usachenko 1997 ) being limited mostly to the case when one or both fields are weak .",
    "the presence of large number of parameters in the problem sometimes makes results of analytical studies not directly transparent .",
    "the case of fields with comparable ( and large ) intensities is also of interest bearing in mind both possible experimental realizations and the theoretical description of the transition between the multiphoton and tunneling regimes .",
    "the multiphoton electron detachment from negative ions presents unique situation when quantitatively reliable results can be obtained by analytical methods in a broad range of parameters characteristic to the problem .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated recently ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , b ) that judicious modification of the keldysh ( 1964 ) model ensures a very good quantitative agreement with results of numerically intensive developments , being much more simple . in many cases",
    "it also provides good agreement with available experimental data .",
    "it works unexpectedly well _ even for small number @xmath3 of photons absorbed_. in addition to numerous examples considered previously ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , b ) , here we briefly comment on the most recent experiments by zhao _",
    "et al _ ( 1997 ) on non - resonant excess photon detachment of negative hydrogen ions .",
    "after absorption of _ two photons _ , the electron is ejected in superposition of @xmath4 and @xmath5 waves due to selection rules .",
    "the experiment demonstrates prevalence of @xmath5 wave contribution ( 90% @xmath6 10% ) .",
    "our calculations give for @xmath5 and @xmath4 waves population 86.2% and 13.6% respectively and higher partial waves .",
    "however , this unphysical effect proves to be less than 0.2% thus sustaining the model applicability . ] for experimental conditions ( light frequency @xmath7 , field intensity @xmath8 .",
    "the elaborate numerical calculations by telnov and chu ( 1996 ) and by nikolopoulos and lambropoulos ( 1997 ) give for @xmath5 wave population 91% and 89% respectively .",
    "the difference between these values is almost the same as the difference between our result and that of nikolopoulos and lambropoulos ( 1997 ) , all three theoretical predictions lying within experimental error bars .",
    "this , together with the cases considered earlier allows us to suggest that even for @xmath9 an approach ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , b ) provides an accuracy comparable with that of the most elaborate numerical developments .",
    "the present paper extends approach of gribakin and kuchiev ( 1997a , b ) to the case of bichromatic field .",
    "its objective is to provide the scheme and some representative quantitative results for two - colour electron detachment from negative ions . in particular ,",
    "the phase effects and the polar asymmetry are studied .",
    "the number of parameters in the problem is quite large and at the moment they can not be fixed experimentally .",
    "nevertheless it seems to be worthwhile to carry out some pivoting calculations in order to obtain insight into the possible magnitude of effects specific for negative ions in bichromatic fields .",
    "we consider angular differential detachment rates , heights of atd ( above threshold detachment ) peaks and total detachment rates .",
    "the previously developed scheme ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a , b ) needs some modifications to incorporate bichromatic problem when electric field in the light wave @xmath10 is a superposition of two harmonic components with the frequencies @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the amplitude vectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 respectively ; @xmath2 is the difference of field phases .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the paper unless stated otherwise .",
    "we consider a case of commensurable field frequencies which implies that the common period @xmath15 exists such that @xmath16 for some mutually simple integers @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the exact expression for the differential transition rate @xmath19 is derived following appendix a of the paper by gribakin and kuchiev ( 1997a ) with the result @xmath20 here @xmath21 describes an initial state for the time - independent hamiltonian @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a quasienergy state for the total hamiltonian @xmath24 , which includes interaction with the periodic field @xmath25 , @xmath26 : @xmath27 \\ , \\psi_\\lambda , \\\\",
    "\\psi_\\lambda(t ) = \\exp ( - i e_\\lambda t ) \\ , \\phi_\\lambda , \\quad \\ , \\quad \\quad \\phi_\\lambda(t ) = \\phi_\\lambda(t+t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath28 is the quasienergy , @xmath29 is the density of states , @xmath30 is the active electron vector .",
    "the energy @xmath31 absorbed by electromagnetic field could be presented as @xmath32 with some integers @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however this representation ( i.e. the choice of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) generally is non - unique which reflexes existence of different coherent interfering paths ( with different number of absorbed and emitted photons of each frequency ) leading to the same final state .",
    "if interaction of light wave with an electron is described in the dipole - length form , as presumed above , then a long range contribution to the matrix elements is emphasized .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to employ an asymptotic form of the initial - state wave function ( gribakin and kuchiev 1997a ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the charge of the atomic residual core ( @xmath39 for a negative ion ) , and @xmath40 is the unit vector .",
    "the coefficients @xmath41 are tabulated for many negative ions ( radzig and smirnov 1985 ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath42 ( [ ad ] ) is evaluated neglecting the influence of atomic potential on the photoelectron in the final state .",
    "further on , the integral over time in ( [ ad ] ) is calculated within the stationary phase approximation which presumes large magnitude of the classical action @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the classical electron momentum due to the field @xmath45 the photoelectron translational momentum @xmath46 plays a role of the quantum number @xmath47 above ; in particular , the quasienergy @xmath48 , @xmath49 includes contribution from the electron quiver energy due to the field .",
    "the result of calculations of the amplitude ( [ ad ] ) could be written as a modification of the formula ( 25 ) in the paper by gribakin and kuchiev ( 1997a ) : @xmath50 a corresponding expression for the detachment rate for the negative ion case ( @xmath51 ) reads : @xmath52 here the subscript @xmath53 indicates that the function is calculated at the saddle point @xmath54 which satisfies equation @xmath55 in the plane of the complex - valued time the saddle points @xmath56 lie symmetrically with respect to the real axis .",
    "summation in ( [ a ] ) includes the points lying in the upper half plane ( @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath60 .",
    "the magnitude of the final electron translational momentum @xmath61 is governed by the energy conservation @xmath62 which ensures that the momentum is real for open atd channels .    according to ( [ s ] ) , ( [ k ] ) , ( [ f ] )",
    "we have @xmath63    the frequencies @xmath11 and @xmath12 are integer multiples of the basic frequency @xmath64 @xmath65 assuming for definiteness that @xmath66 and introducing @xmath67 we notice that the function @xmath68 is a polynomial of the power @xmath69 in @xmath70 .",
    "this observation is of practical importance since equation ( [ sp ] ) defining the saddle point is equivalent to @xmath71 the efficient numerical procedures for finding roots of polynomials are available , and , in particular , one can be confident that _ all _ the roots are found .",
    "the practical calculations are conveniently carried out using the _ mathematica _ program ( wolfram 1991 ) . starting from the expression for @xmath72 one derives @xmath73 and @xmath74 by analytical integration and differentiation respectively .",
    "the saddle points are found using eq.([pz ] ) , and the roots @xmath56 lying in the upper half plane are selected . finite summation over @xmath53 in ( [ a ] ) or ( [ w ] ) completes the calculation .",
    "the roots @xmath56 and hence the photoionization amplitude ( [ a ] ) and rate ( [ w ] ) depend on the orientation of electron translational momentum @xmath46 with respect to the field amplitudes @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is not difficult to consider the fields of various relative orientation and polarization , but for simplicity we limit our further calculations to linear polarized fields with @xmath75 .",
    "then the differential photoionization rate depends only on the single angle @xmath76 between the vectors @xmath46 and @xmath75 .",
    "our calculations for h@xmath0 detachment are carried out for the parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( radzig and smirnov 1985 ) . the frequencies ratio @xmath79 is considered . in this case",
    "the field ( [ f ] ) have zero mean value , but possesses polar asymmetry ( i.e. asymmetry under inversion of the @xmath80 axis directed along @xmath75 ) which could be conveniently characterized by the time - average value ( baranova _ et al _ 1990 ) @xmath81 presuming that @xmath82 , from this expression one infers , for instance , that for the phase @xmath83 $ ] the electric field effectively attains larger values in the positive-@xmath80 direction than in the negative-@xmath80 one .",
    "this is illustrated , for example , by fig.1 in the paper by schafer and kulander ( 1992 ) , or by fig.2 in the paper by baranova _",
    "et al _ ( 1993 ) .",
    "note that our definition of the phase @xmath2 is the same as in the papers by baranova _",
    "et al _ ( 1990 ) , muller _ et al _ ( 1990 ) , pazdzersky and yurovsky ( 1995 ) , but differs from that chosen by schafer and kulander ( 1992 ) who describe the electric filed as @xmath84 .",
    "namely , the phases are related as @xmath85 .",
    "although the formula ( [ f3 ] ) shows that the field has polar symmetry for @xmath86 and the maximal polar asymmetry for @xmath87 , quite paradoxically , the differential detachment rate ( [ w ] ) possesses polar symmetry for @xmath87 ( i.e. is invariant under transformation @xmath88 ) , and is asymmetrical for other values of phase ( see discussion by baranova _",
    "et al _ ( 1990 ) , schafer and kulander ( 1992 ) , pazdzersky and yurovsky ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "the other features of the phase effects are as follows .    1 .",
    "the system hamiltonian is a 2@xmath89-periodic function of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the system hamiltonian is not changed by simultaneous transformation @xmath90 , @xmath88 . the same applies to the differential detachment rate ( [ w ] ) .",
    "3 .   the transformation @xmath91 leaves the hamiltonian invariant only if @xmath92 is replaced by @xmath93 .    as stressed by baranova _",
    "et al _ ( 1990 ) , baranova and zeldovich ( 1991 ) , anderson _",
    "et al _ ( 1992 ) , baranova _ et al _ ( 1993 ) , the problem is invariant under the time inversion operation provided the final - state electron interaction with the atomic core is neglected .",
    "this is the case in the present model .",
    "therefore our differential ionization rates are the same for @xmath2 and @xmath94 ; hence it is sufficient for us to consider phases only from the interval @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the calculations by baranova _",
    "et al _ ( 1990 ) within the perturbation theory and by schafer and kulander ( 1992 ) within the wave propagation technique took into account the final state electron - core interaction .",
    "therefore they have found some deviations from the symmetry under @xmath96 transformation .",
    "however , for the negative ion photodetachment this effect could be anticipated to have only minor influence .",
    "at first we consider two fields with the frequencies @xmath97 and @xmath98 and equal intensities @xmath99 .",
    "it is well known that the regime of detachment process is governed by the keldysh parameter @xmath100 ( @xmath101 for multiphoton detachment in perturbative regime ; @xmath102 for strong field , or tunneling regime ) . in the present case for the first field we have @xmath103 , and for the second field @xmath104 , which corresponds to multiphoton regime .",
    "fig.1 ( as well as figs.2 - 4 below ) shows differential detachment rate as a function of the angle @xmath76 .",
    "the abscissas of the plots give the magnitude of @xmath105 where the right hand side was calculated using the right hand side of the formula ( [ w ] ) .",
    "the left hand side of eq.([dd ] ) has the factor @xmath106 .",
    "it means that the true detachment rate in case of h@xmath0 ion is twice larger than that given by eq.([w ] ) . by this",
    "we account for the two possible spin states of residual h atom ( i.e. for the presence of two equivalent electrons in h@xmath0 ) .    in fig.1",
    "we show the differential detachment rate for the first and second atd peaks which correspond to absorption of @xmath107 and @xmath108 photons of frequency @xmath109 respectively . in fig.2",
    "the same results are shown but for doubled value of the field amplitude @xmath110 . in fig.3",
    "the amplitude @xmath110 is the same as in fig.1 , but the amplitude @xmath111 is doubled .    in all cases the angular distributions exhibit strong dependence on the field phase difference @xmath2 .",
    "this is well expected since the angular patterns are formed by interference of contributions coming from different complex - valued moments of time @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath87 the distribution is rather flat , with @xmath2 increasing it becomes more oscillatory .",
    "an interesting , and not obvious feature is that for @xmath86 the rate turns zero at the values of angle @xmath76 where it has minimum .",
    "in fig.4 we present the results for the same frequencies as before and equal field intensities @xmath112 . here",
    "the keldysh parameter for the first field is @xmath113 .",
    "bearing in mind the presence of the second field one can suppose that the situation corresponds to the onset of strong - field domain .",
    "the first open atd channel corresponds to absorption of @xmath114 photons of frequency @xmath109 .",
    "the patterns in differential rates become more oscillatory than in the weak filed case .",
    "the partial detachment rate for each atd channel is obtained by integration of ( [ w ] ) over angles @xmath115 we present separately the result @xmath116 of integration over the upper half - space of the electron ejection @xmath117 and its counterpart @xmath118 for the lower half - space @xmath119 .",
    "these magnitudes give a bulk characterization for the partial rate polar asymmetry . as discussed above , the polar asymmetry disappears ( i.e. @xmath120 ) for @xmath87 . in the perturbative regime ( fig.5 ) for the same conditions as in fig.1 we see that the bulk polar asymmetry parameter @xmath121 exceeds @xmath122 even for the lowest atd channel ( @xmath123 ) provided the phase @xmath2 is not too small ( the open atd channels are labeled by the number @xmath124 in order of increasing emitted electron energy ) . for higher atd peaks",
    "the bulk asymmetry is even larger .",
    "the partial detachment rates integrated over all ejection angles @xmath125 is shown in fig.6 for three representative values of @xmath2 .",
    "even for @xmath123 the variation of the phase @xmath2 leads to the substantial change in the detachment rate described by a factor 4 .    in the tunneling regime the bulk polar asymmetry ( fig.7 )",
    "is not as prominent as in the perturbative regime .",
    "nevertheless it is quite substantial .",
    "note that both in fig.5 and fig.7 the electron emission in the upper half - space @xmath126 is more probable for all @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath128 in the interval of phases considered ( @xmath129 $ ] ) . as discussed above",
    "( see the property ( ii ) ) , the situation is reversed for @xmath130 $ ] . for small value of the phase @xmath131 in fig.7 there is a clear tendency to swap the relation between @xmath132 and @xmath133 for higher values of @xmath127 which is prevented by a kind of pseudocrossing. for larger @xmath2 the partial rates @xmath133 are strongly suppressed when @xmath127 increases .",
    "the phase effects in the partial rates @xmath134 are less significant in the tunneling regime ( fig.8 ) .",
    "the total detachment rates are obtained by summation over all open atd channels : @xmath135 the results for the total rates as well as @xmath136 are presented in table 1 . in the perturbative regime",
    "we see again strong bulk asymmetry ( three orders of magnitude and more ) if the phase difference @xmath2 is not close to zero , and substantial variation of @xmath137 with @xmath2 .",
    "actually this result reiterates that for the partial rate with @xmath123 since the latter gives a dominant contribution to the total rate in the perturbative regime .    in the strong field regime the bulk polar asymmetry @xmath138 remains well manifested in the rate summed over all atd channels . however , the total rate @xmath137 is practically insensitive to the phase variation .",
    "the partial rates @xmath134 in fig.8 exhibit some oscillatory structure as functions of @xmath127 with position of extrema depending on @xmath2 .",
    "this @xmath2-dependence almost completely disappears after summation over @xmath127 as table 1 shows .",
    "as a summary , the approach of gribakin and kuchiev ( 1997a , b ) provides convenient tool for investigating two - colour photodetachment of negative ions . the bichromatic electron detachment for h@xmath0 ion in the fields with 1:2 frequency ratio is examined in the perturbative and tunneling regimes .",
    "the polar asymmetry is found to be tremendously strong ( @xmath139 ) in the perturbative regime .",
    "note that the asymmetry remains strong and keeps the same sign for all atd for a wide range of phases @xmath140 .",
    "this property makes this effect be convenient for experimental observation because it manifests itself very strongly even for a relatively poor resolution of the phase @xmath141 .",
    "it should be noted that via the recoil mechanism the predicted effect leads also to acceleration of the core thus creating anisotropic flux of neutral h atoms .",
