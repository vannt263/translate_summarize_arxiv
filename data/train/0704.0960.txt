    "mechanical harmonic oscillator plays an important role in the historical development of quantum mechanics .",
    "the harmonic oscillator problem was one of the few completely solvable problems when one began to learn quantum mechanics . due to the macroscopic nature , the experiments of mechanical harmonic oscillators did nt achieve much progress for a quite long time , however .",
    "recently , with the development in quantum information processing , people are now searching for possible applications of mechanical harmonic oscillator in this field , and evidence for quantized displacement in a nanomechanical harmonic oscillator has been observed @xcite .",
    "many good physical ideas about the harmonic oscillator came up , though this system is rather simple .",
    "squeezed state was one of them .",
    "squeezed state provides a good example of the interplay between experiment and theory in the development of quantum mechanics .",
    "statistical properties of squeezed states have been widely investigated and the possibility of applying squeezed states to study the fundamental quantum physics phenomena , as well as to detect the gravitational radiation , has been recognized @xcite .    though the idea of squeezed states originated from mechanical harmonic oscillator , the first experiment realization was the squeezed states of electromagnetic field in nonlinear quantum optics@xcite .",
    "in the nonlinear optical experiments , three - wave and four - wave mixing were two main methods to generate squeezed states .",
    "if one injects low energy photons into a nonlinear optical medium , the second harmonic generation may be induced and this forms a squeezed state , this procedure is called three - wave mixing . though the theory of four - wave mixing was more complicated , the first squeezed state of electromagnetic field was implemented in this system . and",
    "recently , the theory of generating squeezed states in a high - q cavity was considered @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been significant progress in realizing quantum optics in solid state electrical circuits .",
    "this new subject has a nickname  circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit qed ) \" @xcite .",
    "the extreme strong coupling limit in cavity qed has been implemented experimentally with circuit qed systems , such as superconducting charge qubit and superconducting transmission line resonator ( stlr ) system @xcite , flux qubit and quantum @xmath1 oscillator system @xcite , and phase qubit and nanomechanical resonator ( nmr ) system ( which is a mechanical harmonic oscillator ) @xcite .    because of the extreme strong coupling in circuit qed , generating squeezed states in such systems became very interesting and attracted much attention @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , using two modes of the stlr coupled to a superconducting charge qubit simultaneously , the authors studied microwave parametric down - conversion and discussed the squeezed states of one mode of the stlr . in the other refs.@xcite , the authors discussed the generation of squeezed states of nmr .",
    "the generation of squeezed states of nmr in these schemes use either the operations on the qubit or dissipation and measurement to produce the needed nonlinearity .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme for generating squeezed states of nmr in circuit qed , and it is similar to the three - wave mixing in optical cavity experiments .",
    "our proposal is based on the system consisting of a superconducting cooper - pair box ( cpb ) , also a superconducting charge qubit , a nmr and a stlr .",
    "we find that with certain biased conditions of the cpb , the nonlinear process can be implemented and the squeezed states of nmr can easily be generated .",
    "the nonlinear interaction can be switched on and off at will by changing the external biased flux of the cpb . by controlling the gate charge @xmath2 and/or @xmath3",
    ", one can get different squeezed variables @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 .",
    "compared with other schemes , our scheme is more simple and effective in generating the squeezed states . in this scheme , the state of cpb is adiabatically kept in its ground states , and does not need qubit operations so that it avoids the restriction set by the decoherence time of the qubit .",
    "the system under consideration is shown in fig.[model ] . a stlr ( the blue line at the bottom of fig.[model ] ) is placed close to a cpb . the state of cpb is separately controlled by the gate voltage @xmath6 through a gate capacitance @xmath7 .",
    "the cpb is also coupled to a large superconductor reservoir through two identical josephson junctions with capacitance @xmath8 and josephson energy @xmath9 , and this forms a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) and is also the basic configuration of superconducting charge qubit .",
    "the squid configuration allows one to apply external flux to control the josephson energy . for superconducting charge qubits ,",
    "the capacitance @xmath7 is much less than @xmath8 . in this regime",
    "a convenient basis is formed by the charge states , characterized by the number of cooper pairs @xmath10 on the cpb .",
    "in the neighborhood of @xmath11 , only two charge states @xmath12 and @xmath13 play a role , while all other charge states , having a much higher energy , can be ignored . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian of the cpb reads @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the charging energy , @xmath16 is the total capacitance saw by the cpb , @xmath17 is the gate charge induced by the gate voltage , and @xmath18 is the externally applied flux .    for a cpb fabricated inside a stlr ,",
    "there is not only the dc voltage @xmath6 but also a quantum part @xmath19 applied on the gate capacitance .",
    "the quantized voltage at the antinode @xmath20 of the stlr takes it s maximum amplitude @xcite @xmath21 here , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 being the length , the inductance and capacitance per unit length of the stlr , respectively . at low temperatures ,",
    "there is only one mode of the stlr , say @xmath26 , that couples to the cpb , then the quantum voltage applied on the gate capacitance beomes @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the joint system ( stlr and cpb ) has a spin - boson form @xmath28    now we consider the coupling between the nmr and the cpb .",
    "a nmr is fabricated as a part of the squid , which has a length @xmath29 and width @xmath30 , as shown in fig.[model ] .",
    "considering the small displacement of the nmr , the effective area of the squid is @xmath31 , where @xmath4 is the displacement operator and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 being the frequency and mass of the nmr , respectively .",
    "thus the flux bias of the squid is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the flux bias corresponding to the equilibrium position of the nmr @xcite . with the total flux bias ,",
    "the effective josephson coupling energy of the squid becomes @xmath37 the hamiltonian of the total system , including stlr , nmr and cpb reads @xmath38 it s obviously that the josephson coupling energy eq.([potential ] ) is a nonlinear function of @xmath4 and can be expanded to @xmath39 .",
    "\\label{potential2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in general , @xmath4 is very small , then the first and second term of eq.([potential2 ] ) can be discarded and expanded to the first order of @xmath4 , respectively . in this way",
    ", one can get the linearized function of josephson coupling energy of @xmath4 , and there is only linear interaction terms remained in hamiltonian ( [ htotal ] ) . as pointed by zhou _",
    "@xcite , the nonlinearity of the josephson coupling energy in @xmath4 should nt be neglected all the time , and it would be important for the generation of squeezed states .",
    "in the past years , two cavities interacting with a two - level atom has been widely studied @xcite , they focused on the linear interaction in such systems . here , we study the nonlinear interaction in the stlr , nmr and cpb system . an important nonlinear effect is the generation of squeezed states , which is an outstanding task in quantum mechanics . in the following",
    "we show how we realize the nonlinear interaction and how we can use the nonlinear interaction to generate squeezed states .",
    "our method is similar to the three - wave mixing in quantum optics .    in order to realize nonlinear interaction",
    ", one can bias the squid at @xmath40 , here @xmath41 is an integer , and expand the josephson energy to the second order in @xmath4 , then the hamiltonian ( [ htotal ] ) becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43    in the following we choose the eigenenergy basis ( spanned by @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) to simplify the above hamiltonian . here , @xmath46 $ ] is the mixing angle . in the representation of eigenenergy basis of the cpb and under the rotating - wave approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is simplified to @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    assuming the detunings between the cpb and the stlr and the nmr",
    "satisfy the large detuning limits , that is @xmath53hlich transformation @xcite on the total hamiltonian ( [ hra ] ) . dividing the hamiltonian ( [ hra ] ) into two parts @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "apply a unitary transformation @xmath57 with the generator @xmath58 , and expand @xmath59 to second order in @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath62 if the cpb is adiabatically kept on the ground state , the effective hamiltonian becomes @xmath63 in general , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , then the effective hamiltonian can be approximated as @xmath66 in the interaction picture , the hamiltonian ( [ pdc ] ) reads @xmath67 where @xmath68 . if @xmath69 , that is @xmath70 and @xmath71 , in this situation the hamiltonian becomes @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the coupling constant between the stlr and nmr .    in the parametric approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hinter ] ) becomes @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the amplitude and phase of the stlr which is in a coherent state .",
    "the time evolution operator of the nmr in the interaction picture reads @xmath77 in fact , the time evolution operator ( [ top ] ) is the squeezed operator of the nmr . for a time duration @xmath78",
    ", the squeezed operator reads @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the effective squeezed parameter . for the nmr initially in the vacuum state @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the variance in the two quadratures @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 , can be calculated directly using the transformation @xmath87 ,    @xmath88    and the nmr is in the squeezed state @xmath89 if the nmr in the coherent state @xmath90 initially , one can generate the ideal squeezed state @xmath91 .    to estimate the squeezed efficiency , we choose the typical parameters in current solid - state circuits experiments as follows : @xmath92 ghz , @xmath93 ghz , @xmath94 ghz , @xmath95 , @xmath96 t , @xmath97 m , @xmath98v , and @xmath99 m. we can get two different values of coupling constant @xmath100 hz with @xmath2 and @xmath101 hz with @xmath102 .    in the above discussion",
    ", we have assumed an ideal situation in which the noise and fluctuations were not included .",
    "the noise in the cpb may not be considered in our scheme because the cpb can naturally stay in it s ground state at low temperatures for a very long time . here",
    "we investigate the effect of a finite linewidth @xmath103 induced by phase fluctuations in driving coherent state on the squeezing properties of the nmr , as has been done in three - wave mixing in quantum optics .     versus @xmath104 for different ratios ( a ) @xmath105 , ( b ) @xmath106 ,",

    "the variances in the amplitude of @xmath4 increases due to the phase fluctuations in the driving coherent state .",
    "there is a minimum in @xmath111 which decreases with increasing @xmath112 .",
    "it s evident from eq.([sq ] ) that the phase fluctuation in driving coherent state would affect the squeezed efficient severely with increasing time @xmath78 due to the existence of @xmath113 .",
    "our scheme is much different from the existing ones such as refs.@xcite . in our scheme",
    ", it does nt need any operations on the cpb and does nt use dissipation and measurement to generate the needed nonlinearity .",
    "it just needs to adiabatically keep the cpb in it s ground state .",
