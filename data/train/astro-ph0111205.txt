    "recent data suggest that gravitational lens systems may provide a method for finding moderate and high - redshift groups of galaxies .",
    "specifically , observations of four gravitational lens systems ( mg  0751 + 2716 , pg  1115 + 080 , mg  1131 + 0456 , and jvas  b1422 + 231 ) have detected and spectroscopically confirmed groups of galaxies which are associated with the primary lensing galaxy @xcite . in addition , there are at least two lens systems ( class  b1359 + 154 and a second group for mg  1131 + 0456 ) for which the high spatial density and colors of the galaxies close to the lens system suggest the presence of a group @xcite .",
    "all of these groups are compact , with at least three members within a projected radius of @xmath730  ( within 17 in the case of b1359 + 154 ) .",
    "we note that several gravitational lenses are associated with more massive systems , namely clusters of galaxies .",
    "the most famous example is the first gravitational lens to be discovered q0957 + 561 @xcite .",
    "however , the project described in this paper is concerned only with small groups of galaxies .",
    "although these data are not conclusive , they strongly suggest that the primary lensing galaxies in gravitational lens systems are associated with groups of galaxies , implying that a larger association of galaxies may contribute to the lensing mass distribution .",
    "in addition , @xcite analyze the lensing rates in the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ; * ? ? ? * ) and find that the number of multiple - imaged galaxies is an order of magnitude smaller than predicted on the basis of radio lens surveys .",
    "they argue that this strong deficit of gravitational lenses in the hdf - n @xcite is associated with the subsequent lack of elliptical  group combinations at @xmath8 , the most likely redshift for lensing .",
    "hence , they postulate that most galaxy lenses are located in compact groups .",
    "similarly , an analysis based on the relationship between galaxy types and their local environment by @xcite suggests that at least 25% of gravitational lenses should be found in groups or clusters .",

    "this velocity dispersion has also been corrected for redshift measurement errors which are typically about 100 km s@xmath3 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we compute the uncertainty in the dispersion according to the prescription of @xcite , which assumes that the errors in velocity dispersions can be modeled as a @xmath61 distribution and that a galaxy s velocity deviation from the mean group redshift is independent of the galaxy s mass ( i.e. , the group is virialized ) . for more details , see  3 of @xcite .",

    "this red sequence includes the lensing galaxy at @xmath77 , as well as the five elliptical - like galaxies in the foreground group at @xmath59 .",
    "the average colors of the five foreground galaxies are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    of the remaining five group members , four are significantly bluer , as expected from their star - forming spectral features .",

    "the galaxy s colors , however , are noticeably redder than the other four active galaxies . here , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "these results may indicate a galaxy with a relatively old stellar population which has recently undergone a burst of star formation due to an interaction or merger .",
    "local galaxy groups follow a well - established correlation between early - type fraction and velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "as the velocity dispersion increases from 100 to 450 km s@xmath3 , the early - type fraction increases from effectively zero to 55% .",
    "these measures include all ( @xmath85 ) member galaxies that are brighter than @xmath86 to @xmath87 and are within a radius of @xmath88 mpc @xcite .",
    "based on the local correlation , we expect the early - type fraction for our moderate - redshift group to be approximately @xmath89 . from the spectroscopic data , we find that five ( out of ten ) galaxies have spectra which are typical of early - type galaxies , while the remaining five galaxies are star - forming , implying that they are most likely late - type ( spiral or irregular ) galaxies .",
    "this suggests an early - type fraction of 50% , which is on the high end of that expected from the local correlation .",
    "this result , however , may not be statistically significant because the scatter in the local correlation is reasonably large ( see figure 7 of * ? ?",
    "more importantly , our survey does not reach the faint magnitudes of the local observations . if we apply a magnitude limit more typical of our survey ( @xmath90 ) to the local group data , we see an increase in the early - type fraction associated with a given velocity dispersion , although the scatter in the relationship also increases .",
    "this is not unexpected since the brightest galaxies in groups are normally early - types .",
    "for the groups with the highest velocity dispersion , the early - type fraction approaches 80% or more .    to measure accurately the early - type fraction , we need visual classifications of the group galaxies . fortunately , we can measure these morphologies for all but one of the group members through the publically - available hst images .",
    "the wfpc2 observations of b0712 + 472 were taken as part of two separate programs , go-5908 ( pi jackson ) and go-9133 ( pi falco , as part of the castles program ) .",
    "we have chosen to analyze the go-9133 observations because the exposure times are longer , the images have been dithered in three positions to improve the angular resolution , and the position angle provides a more beneficial field - of - view .",
    "the observations were taken in the f555w and f814w filters for a total exposure time of 2200 seconds each .",
    "we have reduced these data using the `` drizzle '' software @xcite given in the stsdas package * ditherii*. nine of the ten group members fall within the wfpc2 field - of - view .",

    "* ) are listed in table 3 .",
    "figure  [ fig_wfpc2_poststamp ] shows the postage stamp images of each galaxy .",
    "the four galaxies which have very strong [ ] and/or @xmath71 emission ( g009 + 005 , g+016 + 007 , g001022 , g+056 + 020 ; see figure  [ fig_starform ] ) are classified as late - type spiral galaxies .",
    "the remaining five galaxies which have elliptical - like spectra , with little or no [ ] emission ( g+008 + 009 , g+015 + 015 , g+029021 , g+018079 , g+052071 ; see figure  [ fig_oldstar ] ) , are classified as either elliptical , s0 or sa galaxies .",
    "the only galaxy for which we do not have a visual classification , g+089151 , is the one which is farthest from the lens system .",
    "this galaxy has extremely strong @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and [ ] emission and is , therefore , almost certainly a late - type ( spiral or irregular ) galaxy .",
    "based on this evidence , we conclude that the early - type fraction is 40% and that the morphological content of this moderate - redshift group is consistent ( within the uncertainties ) with that of nearby groups of galaxies .",
    "the presence of a group of galaxies centered close to a gravitational lens system will perturb the lensing gravitational potential and affect the lensed images of the background source .",
    "the effect of the group mass distribution on the main gravitational potential may be expressed in terms of an additional convergence ( @xmath91 ) and shear ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the convergence describes the isotropic component of the magnification of an image produced at a position @xmath93 , while the shear describes the anisotropic distortion of the image .",
    "some lens systems require a strong shear component in order to produce the observed image configuration . particularly notable",
    "is the jvas b1422 + 231 system , in which the early lens models required a strong external shear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , possibly in addition to an extremely flattened mass distribution in the primary lensing galaxy @xcite .",
    "later observations found a group of galaxies that provided the necessary external shear @xcite . a simple singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) plus external shear model for the class b0712 + 472 system suggests that the external shear in this system should be small ( @xmath94 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we note that this model is not a particularly good fit to the observations ( @xmath95 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and might be improved by a multiple - shear model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is probably correct in indicating that a very large external shear is not needed for this system .    we can estimate the shear contribution of the foreground group to class b0712 + 472 and compare it to the predicted value .",
    "we make the approximation that the group gravitational potential is that produced by a sis .",
    "the sis has a particularly simple analytic expression for @xmath96 , namely , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the critical radius of the sis and @xmath28 is the distance from the center of the sis , both expressed in angular units . for a sis with one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath99 , lensing a background source at a redshift @xmath100 , the critical radius ( einstein ring radius )",
    "is @xmath101 here , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the angular diameter distances from the sis to the background source and from the observer to the background source , respectively .",
    "the ratio of these distances is a function of the redshifts of the sis and the background source and has a weak dependence on the cosmological model given by @xmath104 and @xmath105 . for the group of galaxies discussed in this paper ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is @xmath106 and the redshifts are @xmath107 and @xmath108 for the group and the background source , respectively . to explore the dependence on the cosmological model , we calculate @xmath98 for three common models : @xmath109 = ( 1.0,0.0 ) , ( 0.2,0.0 ) , and ( 0.2,0.8 ) .",
    "the resulting critical radii are @xmath110176 , 177 , and 197 , respectively .",
    "the convergence and shear produced by the group at the position of the lens system , for the three cosmologies considered , are : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the angular distance from the group center to the lens system , in arcseconds .",
    "the effect of the foreground group on the gravitational lensing potential depends critically on @xmath112 . unfortunately , this quantity is not well determined because the position of the group center is not clear .",
    "a simple calculation of the luminosity - weighted centroid of the group gives @xmath113 , and thus @xmath114 , which is consistent with the value predicted by @xcite .",
    "however , with only ten galaxies known to be in the group , this number is subject to the effects of small - number statistics . for example , by excluding the galaxy most distant from the lens system , the luminosity - weighted group centroid shifts significantly closer to the lens , giving @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "in addition , the luminosity - weighted centroid is almost certainly biased toward the south of the lens system .",
    "this bias arises because a fifth - magnitude star lies @xmath76  to the north - northwest of the lens .",
    "scattered light from this star strongly contaminated our palomar 60-in images . in order to reduce the effect of the scattered light to a reasonable level",
    ", we centered our images @xmath74  to the south of the lens system .",
    "the horizontal line in figure  [ fig_keckim ] indicates the northern limit of the palomar 60-in images .",
    "because we had no information about galaxies north of this line , they were not included on the slitmasks .",
    "it is likely that the keck images , which are much less affected by the scattered light , will provide good candidate group members to the north of the lens system .",
    "the inclusion of these galaxies could shift the group centroid farther to the north and closer to the lens system .",
    "a final estimate of @xmath112 , and thus @xmath96 , can be obtained by exploiting a relationship seen in nearby groups of galaxies . in local galaxy groups for which diffuse x - ray emission has been detected ,",
    "the brightest group galaxy ( bgg ) is located at the center of the group potential @xcite .",
    "thus , if the class b0712 + 472 foreground group is virialized , the distance from the bgg to the lens system should be a good estimator of @xmath112 .",
    "our survey of the group members is far from complete due to the northern cutoff in our galaxy selection and the sparseness of our spectroscopic coverage .",
    "however , for the purposes of our rough estimate , we can assume that the brightest galaxy known to be in the group ( g+015 + 015 , with @xmath117 ) is the bgg .",
    "this would imply that @xmath118  and , thus , @xmath119 .",
    "unless further observations significantly increase the number of galaxies known to be in this group , it is unlikely that the optical observations alone will adequately determine the location of the center of the group gravitational well .",
    "a sensitive x - ray observation with xmm or chandra , which would provide a measure of the total and gas mass distribution , could give a much more accurate location for the group centroid .",
    "we present the first results from our observational program which seeks to exploit the gravitational lens  galaxy group connection to find and study moderate to high - redshift groups of galaxies .",
    "we have surveyed the field surrounding the gravitational lens system b0712 + 472 and have found a foreground group of galaxies at @xmath59 which is coincident with the lensing galaxy .",
    "the small group , which contains 10 member galaxies , has dynamical and morphological properties which are consistent with those of local groups of galaxies .",
    "we estimate that the effect of the foreground group on the gravitational lensing potential of b0712 + 472 is small . based on the simplest model , that of a singular isothermal sphere",
    ", the group produces an external shear which is only a few percent .",
    "however , the magnitude of the shear is reasonably uncertain because it is inversely proportional to the distance between the group center and the lens system .",
    "based on the relatively small number of confirmed group members , this distance is uncertain by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "currently , there are five spectroscopically - confirmed groups ( as opposed to massive clusters ) detected by their association with gravitational lens systems . in table 4",
    ", we list the properties of all five groups , including the one presented in this paper .",
    "remarkably , the redshift of each group is @xmath120 .",
    "each is quite compact with harmonic radii less than @xmath121 mpc .",
    "based on the small number of confirmed group members , we find that the velocity dispersions range by more than an order of magnitude , from @xmath122 km s@xmath3 . however , the smallest velocity dispersion is highly uncertain because the group , that associated with mg  0751 + 2716 , has only three confirmed members .",
    "further studies of these systems are clearly required in order to make accurate measurements of the dynamical properties of the groups , as well as the spectral and morphological properties of their member galaxies .",
    "because all five groups have very similar redshifts , they comprise an unique sample in which to study the diversity of group properties at this redshift .",
