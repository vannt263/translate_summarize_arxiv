    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is a quantum destructive interference effect that allows the propagation of a weak coherent probe field through a three - level atomic medium in the @xmath1-configuration in the presence of a strong coupling field @xcite .",
    "it is found that the transmitted light can propagate with group velocities smaller than the speed of light in vacuum @xmath2 ( slow light ) @xcite , or greater than @xmath2 or even with negative group velocities ( superluminal light ) @xcite .",
    "the superluminal light with a negative group velocity @xmath3 has been observed in a cs atomic vapor system @xcite .",
    "moreover , the studies of the eit have been extended to multilevel atomic systems interacting with multiple laser beams @xcite , whose absorption profiles of a weak probe field are different from that of three - level @xmath1 system .",
    "it has been shown that multiple eit windows in the probe absorption spectrum are observed in the multilevel atomic systems @xcite .",
    "multiple eit windows allow transmissions of the probe light at multiple different frequencies simultaneously .",
    "such multiple eit could be useful for multi - channel optical communication and multi - channel quantum information processing .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that light pulses can be stored in atomic coherences with long lifetime by using the eit in atomic mediums @xcite .",
    "the eit - based light storage is a promising technique , which leads to the realization of optical memories @xcite .",
    "recently , studies of the eit effect have been extended to the macroscopic optomechanical systems .",
    "it has been pointed out that the existence of an analogy of the eit in the optomechanical systems @xcite . and",
    "some experiments have been reported for observing the eit - like dips in the optomechanical systems @xcite . besides , the eit in membrane - in - the - middle setup at room temperature has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "additionally , the eit in quadratically coupling optomechanical systems and the eit in optomechanical systems using quantized fields have been analyzed @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the eit in the nonlinearized optomechanical systems has been discussed theoretically @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown experimentally and theoretically that optomechanical systems can be used as optical memory elements @xcite based on the eit effect .",
    "on the other hand , optomechanical systems with multi - membranes coupled to a common cavity mode via radiation pressure have been studied , including cooling and trapping of mechanical modes @xcite , quantum state transfer and entanglement between mechanical modes @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the response of a fabry - perot cavity with @xmath0 membranes having close frequencies to a weak probe field in the absence and the presence of a strong coupling field .",
    "we find that there are at most @xmath0 transparency windows in the transmitted probe field in the presence of the coupling field .",
    "we also show that the group velocity can obtain @xmath0 different values at the transparency and can be manipulated by changing the effective optomechanical coupling strengths .",
    "additionally , we present that an optical cavity with two membranes can store and retrieve a probe pulse at two different frequencies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the system with @xmath0 membranes interacting with a single cavity mode , give the equations of motion for the mean value of the system operators , and obtain the general analytical expression for the component of the output field at the probe frequency . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the numerical results for the output probe field from an optomechanical system with several membranes . in sec .",
    "iv , we demonstrate that the probe pulse at two different frequencies can be stored in mechanical excitations of the two membranes by applying a writing coupling pulse and can be retrieved later by applying a reading coupling pulse . finally , we conclude in sec . v.",
    "we consider an optical fabry - perot cavity containing @xmath0 lossless membranes with effective mass @xmath4 , resonance frequency @xmath5 , and damping rate @xmath6 @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "the thickness of each membrane is much smaller than the wavelength of the cavity field , and each membrane is partially transparent .",
    "the cavity field is driven by a strong coupling field at frequency @xmath8 .",
    "meanwhile a weak probe field at frequency @xmath9 is injected into the cavity .",
    "the intracavity photons exert radiation pressure forces on each membrane so that each membrane makes small oscillations . as a result ,",
    "the resonance frequency of the cavity field depends on the displacement @xmath10 of each membrane , represented by @xmath11 .",
    "here we consider the case that all the membranes are located at the nodes of the frequency @xmath11 of the cavity field .",
    "thus the cavity frequency @xmath11 depends linearly on @xmath10 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the cavity resonance frequency for @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the optomechanical coupling strength between the cavity mode and the @xmath16 membrane .    for convenience ,",
    "we write the position and momentum operators @xmath17 of the membranes in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21=i\\delta_{jk}$ ] . in a frame rotating at the driving frequency @xmath8 , the hamiltonian of the whole system reads @xmath22 here the first two terms are the energies of the cavity field and the @xmath0 mechanical oscillators , respectively .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath2 are the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity field , obey the standard commutation relation @xmath24=1 $ ] , @xmath25 is the photon number operator of the cavity field .",
    "the third term gives the optomechanical interactions between the cavity field and the membranes , @xmath26 .",
    "the last two terms describe the interactions of the cavity field with the coupling field and the probe field , respectively .",
    "the @xmath27 quantifies the coupling strength between the coupling field and the cavity field , depends on the power @xmath28 of the coupling field by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the photon loss rate of the cavity through the fixed mirror .",

    "the @xmath34 is the detuning of the probe field from the coupling field . in the following ,",
    "we are interested in the regime that the mechanical damping rate is much smaller than the photon decay rate @xmath35 .",
    "taking account of the effects of dissipations of the cavity field and the mechanical oscillators , and neglecting quantum noise and thermal noise , we obtain the time evolutions of the expectation values of the system operators @xmath36\\big\\}\\langle c\\rangle+\\varepsilon_{l}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\varepsilon_{p}e^{-i\\delta t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we focus on the strong - driving regime , so the mean field assumption @xmath37 and @xmath38 has been used in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) . since the probe field is much weaker than the coupling field @xmath39 , the steady - state solution to eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) can be approximated to the first order in the probe field @xmath31 . in the long time",
    "limit , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , or @xmath2 .",
    "the solution contains three components , which in the original frame oscillate at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath43 , respectively . substituting eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) into eq . ( [ 3 ] ) , equating coefficients of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we can obtain @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the output field can be obtained by using the input - output relation @xmath49 @xcite . in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , we expand the output field to the first order in the probe field @xmath31 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are the components of the output field oscillating at frequencies @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath43 . hence , the component of the output field at the probe frequency @xmath9 which we are interested in is @xmath54 .",
    "we assume the frequencies of the @xmath0 membranes are slightly different , and the mean value of them is @xmath55 . if @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , the interactions between the cavity field and the membranes are nearly the strongest . in addition , it is assumed that the frequencies of the @xmath0 membranes are much larger than the cavity decay rate @xmath58 . under these conditions ,",
    "the component of the output field at the probe frequency is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the effective optomechanical coupling rate , @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the effective detuning of the coupling field from the cavity resonance frequency , including the frequency shift induced by the radiation pressure .",
    "let us write @xmath52 as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the in - phase and out - of - phase quadratures of the output probe field , representing the absorptive and dispersive properties of the output probe field , respectively .",
    "the quadratures can be measured via the homodyne technique @xcite .",
    "when @xmath35 , @xmath52 is extremely small at @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus if all the frequencies of the @xmath0 membranes are different , the optomechanical system becomes transparent at @xmath0 different frequencies of the probe field in the weak coupling regime @xmath68 .",
    "the full linewidth at half maximum ( fwhm ) of each eit dip is about @xmath69 , which can be broadened by increasing the power of the coupling field .",
    "next we assume that @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) of the frequencies of the membranes are equal to @xmath72 , i.e. , ( @xmath73 ) and the left @xmath74 are different from @xmath72 , the output field at the probe frequency becomes    @xmath75    if @xmath68 , @xmath76 transparency windows exist in the output probe field .",
    "finally if all the @xmath0 membranes have the same frequency @xmath77 , the same damping rate @xmath78 , and the same coupling rate @xmath79 , the output probe field reduces to @xmath80 whose form is similar to that of an optomechanical system with a single mechanical oscillator @xcite .",
    "if @xmath81 , there is only one transparency window at line center @xmath57 in the output probe field , its fwhm is about @xmath82 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the group velocity of the output probe field can be determined by @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath2 is the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "it is noticed that the group velocity @xmath84 depends on the out - of - phase quadrature @xmath65 , the slope @xmath85 , and the probe detuning @xmath86 .",
    "in this section , we numerically evaluate the quadratures @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and the group velocity @xmath84 of the output probe field when the cavity have @xmath0 membranes whose frequencies are very close .",
    "the values of the parameters chosen are similar to those in @xcite : the mean value of the frequencies of the @xmath0 membranes is @xmath87 khz , the cavity decay rate @xmath88 , ( @xmath89 , the system is in the resolved sideband regime ) , the mechanical damping rates are taken to be equal @xmath90 hz .",
    "+   +    we plot the phase quadratures @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the output probe field as a function of the normalized probe detuning @xmath91 for a system with two membranes ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , three membranes ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , and four membranes ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we assume that all membranes are coupled to the cavity field with the same optomechanical coupling strength @xmath92 . in the absence of the coupling field , @xmath64 ( dotted curve )",
    "has the standard lorentzian absorption shape , whereas @xmath65 ( dot - dashed curve ) has a standard dispersion shape . in the presence of the coupling field , @xmath64 ( solid curve )",
    "exhibits narrow two , three , and four transparency windows in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] .",
    "the multiple transparency windows display that the optomechanical system becomes simultaneously transparent to the probe field at multiple different frequencies , which is the result of the destructive interferences between the input probe field and the anti - stokes fields generated by the interactions of the coupling field with the multi - membranes .",
    "moreover , we also note that the eit dips are accompanied by steep variations of @xmath65 ( dashed curve ) with identical negative slopes , which lead to the generation of superluminal light with nearly equal group velocities . for a cavity with two membranes , the group velocities @xmath84 around the two transparency windows",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . at the transparency points @xmath93 ,",
    "the group velocities are @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "we also plot the phase quadratures @xmath64 and @xmath65 of the output probe field for a system with three membranes ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "but each membrane is coupled to the optical mode with nonidentical optomechanical coupling strengths @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "it is seen that three transparency windows with different linewidths appear in the quadrature @xmath64 of the output probe field . and the negative slopes of @xmath65 at the transparency are different , which results in three different group velocities of the output probe light at three different frequencies @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "our calculations show @xmath101 at @xmath98 , @xmath102 at @xmath103 , @xmath104 at @xmath105 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we give an example about a system with four membranes , but three of them having identical frequency , i.e. , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "note that only two transparency windows with different linewidths occur in the quadrature @xmath64 of the output probe field .",
    "the transmitted probe light at the two different frequencies @xmath108 are propagating at the different group velocities @xmath109 .",
    "since the mechanical membrane damping rate @xmath110 is much smaller than the cavity decay rate @xmath30 , an optical cavity with multiple membranes can store a weak probe field at different frequencies as long - lived mechanical excitations in the membranes simultaneously under the eit condition .",
    "here we take a cavity with two membranes for example .",
    "we show the possibility of storing and retrieving a probe light pulse at two different frequencies in such a system .",
    "we assume that the probe laser pulse and the coupling laser pulse are time - dependent , and they have gaussian shapes @xmath111},\\nonumber\\\\ \\varepsilon_{l}(t)&=&\\varepsilon_{l}\\exp{\\big[-\\frac{(t - t_{wr})^2}{2\\tau_{l}^2}\\big]}+\\varepsilon_{l}\\exp{\\big[-\\frac{(t - t_{rd})^2}{2\\tau_{l}^2}\\big]},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the central time of the writing and reading coupling lasers .",
    "the difference @xmath114 gives the storage time .",
    "the @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the widths of the probe pulse and the coupling pulse , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath117 and @xmath118 is less than the fwhm of eit dip @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "moreover , the coupling pulse is much stronger than the probe pulse so that the solution to eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) can take the form @xmath121 ( @xmath122 , @xmath42 , or @xmath2 ) , then a set of coupled differential equations @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , and they can be solved numerically .",
    "we use the following parameters for numerical simulations : @xmath87 khz , @xmath106 , @xmath126 , @xmath88 , @xmath127 hz , @xmath128 , @xmath129 nm , @xmath130 @xmath131w , @xmath132 , @xmath133 ms , @xmath134 ms , @xmath135 ms .",
    "hence @xmath136 hz , which is less than the fwhm of eit dip ( @xmath137 hz ) ,    we plot the normalized power @xmath138 of the input coupling field , the normalized power @xmath139 of the input probe field , the normalized output probe power @xmath140/\\varepsilon_{p}|^2 $ ] , and the normalized intensity of the mechanical excitation @xmath141 for @xmath66 ( @xmath120 ) in figs .  [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] . for @xmath142 , when a writing control pulse is applied , the eit occurs due to the nonlinear interaction between the input coupling pulse and the movable membrane at frequency @xmath143 , it is seen that a fraction of the probe pulse leaves the cavity , leading to the first peak of the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) , while a part of the probe pulse is converted into the mechanical excitation of the membrane at frequency @xmath143 via the downconversion process @xmath144 and stored for a storage time of about @xmath145 ms ( fig .  [ fig8](c ) ) , and then retrieved by applying a reading coupling pulse via the upconversion process @xmath146 ( the second peak of the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) ) . for @xmath147 , the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b)(c ) show a similar result .",
    "therefore , a probe pulse at two different frequencies @xmath148 and @xmath149 can be stored and retrieved by an optical cavity containing two membranes .",
    "in conclusion , we have discussed the response of an optomechanical system which includes @xmath0 membranes having slightly different frequencies to a weak probe field in the presence of an intense coupling field .",
    "we have given a general analytical expression for the output probe field .",
    "we have shown that the system can exhibit the phenomenon of multiple eit . at most @xmath0 transparency windows can be observed .",
    "the linewidths of the transparency windows increase with the effective optomechanical strengths .",
    "the dispersion behavior of the probe field shows steep anomalous dispersion at the eit dips , which results in negative group velocities for the output probe field at multiple frequencies . at most @xmath0 different negative values of the group velocities at the transparency",
    "can be obtained .",
    "these group velocities can be controlled by altering the effective optomechanical strengths .",
    "such controllable multiple eit windows in a macroscopic optomechanical system with @xmath0 membranes permit the probe field at different frequencies transparent simultaneously , hence this system has potential applications in multi - channel optical communication and multi - channel quantum information processing .",
    "further this optomechanical design can be employed to simultaneously realize optical memories for the probe field at different frequencies , leading to higher efficiencies in optical communication .",
