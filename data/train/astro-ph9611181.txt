    "vennes et al . ( 1996a ) identified euve  j1746706 with a new ultramassive white dwarf in extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) all - sky surveys ( _ euve _ , bowyer et al . 1996 ; _ rosat _ wide field camera , pye et al .",
    "previously , this star remained without a precise classification .",
    "vennes et al .",
    "initially reported a mass of @xmath7 based on analysis of the balmer line profiles making euve  j1746706 one of the most massive white dwarfs known with a mass close to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "ultramassive white dwarfs are rare as shown by various studies on the mass function of white dwarfs ( see e.g. , koester , schulz , & weidemann 1979 ; bergeron , saffer , & liebert 1992 ; bragaglia , renzini , & bergeron 1995 ; and finley 1995 ) . among",

    "since then , euv surveys have yielded new ultramassive white dwarfs ( vennes et al .",
    "1996a ; vennes et al .",
    "1997 ) in larger proportion than the sample of stars selected in the catalog of mccook & sion ( 1987 ) for the most recent white dwarf mass distribution studies .",
    "a systematic study of this larger sample of ultramassive white dwarfs will help achieve a better understanding of their origin .",
    "if they indeed form a new class of white dwarf , explaining their formation with just single star evolution would be difficult .",
    "vennes , bowyer , & dupuis ( 1996b ) recently announced the discovery of strong absorption lines of singly ionized helium in the euv spectrum of the ultramassive white dwarf gd  50 .",
    "the presence of helium in the atmosphere of a massive white dwarf is paradoxical ; vennes et al .",
    "( 1996b ) speculate that it is possibly the signature of helium dredge - up from the envelope by meridional circulation currents .",
    "whether the same phenomenon could be observed in other ultramassive white dwarfs or whether rapid rotation is a characteristic of only a few massive white dwarfs remains unclear .",
    "bergeron et al . ( 1994 ) studied properties of a large sample of dao white dwarfs , but none of these objects bears any resemblance to gd  50 or other massive white dwarfs , thus leaving the question open as to the exact nature of these peculiarities .",
    "optical and euv observations of euve  j1746706 and similar objects may , therefore , help establish `` class '' properties for massive white dwarfs , particularly concerning the helium abundance pattern .    since the initial report by vennes et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , we have secured optical and euv spectroscopy to improve our knowledge of the fundamental parameters of this exceptional white dwarf .",
    "we present a multiwavelength study of the new ultramassive white dwarf euve  j1746706 , and we search , in particular , for the presence of helium in the euv spectrum . in   2 , we describe the new optical and euv observations . in   3 ,",
    "we derive new values of the effective temperature and surface gravity using both the balmer line profiles and the euv energy distribution .",
    "we also constrain the helium abundance with a multiparameter study of the euv continuum . in   4 , we discuss euve  j1746706 in light of its possible origin as a merger of a double degenerate and compare it to the case of gd  50 .",
    "finally , we summarize in   5 .",
    "the euv spectrum of euve  j1746706 was acquired using nasa s _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) between 1996 march 27 and april 5 with an effective exposure time of about 180,000 s. the data were reduced using the standard euv package in iraf with version 1.13 of the calibration data described in the _ euve _ guest observer software user s guide ( miller & abbott 1995 ) . the star is detected in the short wavelength spectrometer ( sw , 70190  ) with a maximum flux of the order of @xmath10 photons  @xmath6  s@xmath11  @xmath11 at 125   and signal - to - noise ratio of 5 ( fig .",
    "inspection of the images of the medium wavelength ( mw , 140380  ) and long wavelength ( lw , 280760  ) spectrometers reveals no significant spectra .",
    "the stellar emission is observed between 75 and 175   and is characterized by a featureless continuum typical of the euv spectrum of a da star ; the absence of flux at long wavelengths is the result of attenuation in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "we have also plotted the euv spectrum of gd  50 ( vennes , bowyer , & dupuis 1996b ) , which is mentioned in the introduction as being the sole case of a massive white dwarf showing the series of absorption lines in the euv .",
    "those lines are not detected in the spectrum of euve  j1746706 partly because the hydrogen column density is much larger ( see  3 ) .",
    "however , this does not exclude the presence of helium in the atmosphere : gd  50 would appear similar to euve  j1746706 if attenuated by a larger ism column density .",
    "we will exploit the sensitivity of the sw continuum to the helium opacity in order to limit the the he abundance in the photosphere of euve  j1746706 .",
    "= 0.47      we reobserved euve  j1746706 using the 74-inch telescope at mount stromlo observatory on 1996 april 25 .",
    "we used the spectrometer at the cassegrain focus with a 300 lines  mm@xmath11 grating and a @xmath12 ultraviolet anti - reflection ( uvar ) thinned site ccd ; the images were binned @xmath13 . using standard iraf procedures we extracted a spectrum that covers the balmer series between 3660 and 6040   at 2.32   per pixel or a spectral resolution of fwhm @xmath14 6  .",
    "figure 2 shows the optical spectrum of euve  j1746706 , along with spectra of the massive white dwarf gd  50 and the da white dwarf euve j1800 + 685 ( @xmath15 ; vennes et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the two massive white dwarfs show distinctively broad balmer line profiles in comparison with euve  j1800 + 685 .",
    "we adopted a visual magnitude of @xmath16 ( bessell & dopita 1993 ) , which allows us to establish an absolute visual flux scale .",
    "we measured the effective temperature and surface gravity by simultaneously fittting the h@xmath17 , h@xmath18 , h@xmath19 , and h@xmath20 line profiles with a grid of da model atmospheres computed with assumptions of local thermodynamic equilibrium and a pure hydrogen composition .",
    "the same grid of models is described and used by vennes et al .",
    "( 1996a ) ; the grid points are between 20,000 k and 32,000 k ( in 2000 k steps ) and between 32,000 k and 76,000 k ( in 4000 k steps ) for the effective temperature ( @xmath21 ) and between 7.0 and 9.5 ( in 0.5 steps ) in the logarithm of the surface gravity ( log  @xmath1 ) .",
    "a fit is obtained by means of a @xmath22 test between the observed and synthetic line profiles convolved with the appropriate spectral resolution .",
    "the right part of figure 3 shows the best solution along with the balmer line spectra while the bottom left corner of figure 4 illustrates the 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath23 contours of the fit ( dashed line ) .",
    "our new @xmath21 and log  @xmath1 are , respectively , @xmath24 k and @xmath25 and are only marginally consistent with the values obtained by vennes et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , @xmath26  k and log  @xmath27 .",
    "although our new surface gravity is lower than previously determined , it still implies a membership in the class of ultramassive white dwarfs .",
    "the difference between our value and previous results can only be explained in terms of different approaches in applying the flux calibration .",
    "= 0.47    the euv spectrum is analyzed in a similar fashion but , in addition , we constrain the abundance of helium in the atmosphere and the neutral hydrogen column density in the local ism .",
    "we use a grid of lte model atmospheres computed with a homogeneous abundance of helium ranging between log  he / h = 6 and 2 in steps of 0.5 dex .",
    "( see vennes et al .",
    "1996a for additional details about the grid and vennes et al .",
    "1996b for details concerning the validity of the lte assumption in massive white dwarfs . )",
    "the model spectra are normalized to the @xmath28 magnitude and convolved with the spectral resolution of the _ euve _ spectrometer ( @xmath29   in the sw , @xmath30   in the mw , @xmath31   in the lw ) .",
    "we fitted the flux - calibrated spectrum using @xmath22 minimization and by varying @xmath21 , log  @xmath1 , he / h , and @xmath32 ( the ism hydrogen column density ) .",
    "because the continuum is not detected in the mw and lw detectors , it is impossible to make independent determinations of and column densities ; we set the ratio of the abundances of and to equal to 0.07 and 0.03 based on our knowledge of other lines of sight in the local ism ( vennes et al .",
    "1994 ; dupuis et al .",
    "the effective temperature is well constrained at @xmath33  k while the gravity is more loosely constrained in the range between log  @xmath1 = 8.0 and 9.5 .",
    "we are able to set a 3 @xmath23 upper limit on the helium abundance of he / h @xmath34 , which is less than half the abundance of helium measured in gd  50 ( he / h @xmath35 ; vennes et al .",
    "the neutral hydrogen ism column density is @xmath36 @xmath6 .",
    "the best fit and the contour levels are shown in figure 3 ( left ) and figure 4 , respectively .",
    "we have superposed the balmer lines contours to the euv continuum contours in the ( @xmath21 , log  @xmath1 ) plane in the lower left panel of figure 4 .",
    "a unique solution is found by taking the intersection of the 1 @xmath23 contours , which further constrains the parameters to @xmath37 .    using the hamada - salpeter mass - radius relations for carbon interiors ( hamada & salpeter 1961 )",
    ", we measure a mass of @xmath38 for euve  j1746706 .",
    "this value can be compared to @xmath39 as previously determined by vennes et al.s ( 1996a ) extrapolation on wood s ( 1995 ) mass - radius relations , or @xmath40 when more appropriately interpolated on the hamada - salpeter relations .",
    "based on hamada - salpeter relations , the mass of gd  50 using bergeron et al.s ( 1991 ) parameters is @xmath41 .",
    "the star euve  j1746706 shares an identical mass with gd  50 , but is probably much younger . extrapolating on wood s ( 1995 ) relations , the cooling age of euve  j1746706 is less than @xmath42 myr , while gd  50 is possibly @xmath43 myr older .",
    "massive white dwarfs like euve  j1746706 are rare . in their extensive study of the white dwarf mass distribution , bergeron , saffer , & liebert ( 1992 ) identified gd  50 as the only example of a massive object . however , vennes et al . ( 1996a ) obtained a higher yield of massive white dwarfs from a much smaller sample of 18 euv - selected hot white dwarfs .",
    "the origin of these stars is interesting from a stellar evolution perspective because their masses exceed the upper limit of @xmath44 for c / o white dwarfs , a limit set by the ignition of non - degenerate core carbon burning ( see reviews by weidemann 1990 and bragaglia , renzini , & bergeron 1995 ) .",
    "evolution of isolated stars seems to produce white dwarfs with masses tightly concentrated about @xmath45 with a possible tail extending toward massive white dwarfs ( weidemann 1990 ; bergeron , saffer , & liebert 1992 ; bragaglia , renzini , & bergeron 1995 ; vennes et al .",
    "the progenitor of euve  j1746706 could be a massive star in view of the correlation between the mass of a white dwarf and the mass of its progenitor ( weidemann & koester 1983 ) .",
    "however , estimating the mass of the progenitor of euve  j1746706 is difficult given the large uncertainties in the initial - to - final mass relation . nomoto ( 1984 ) has suggested a scenario in which 810 @xmath46 stars could end their evolution as o+ne+mg white dwarfs with masses in the range of 1.21.37 @xmath46 .",
    "euve  j1746706 and the other ultramassive white dwarfs discovered by vennes et al .",
    "( 1996a,1997 ) could be examples of o+ne+mg white dwarfs , although none of these objects are expected to emerge from the local disk population .",
    "another scenario could be the merger of a double - degenerate system as suggested by bergeron et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for the case of gd  50 .",
    "yungelson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) predict that 20% of merging double degenerates are co - co pairs and 30% are co - he pairs .",
    "are massive white dwarfs the results of co - he mergers ?",
    "the _ euve _ spectrum of gd  50 supports this idea because the helium abundance is much too high to be explained by a process like radiative acceleration .",
    "vennes et al .",
    "( 1996b ) discuss the possibility that gd  50 is rapidly rotating , a residual of the orbital angular momentum , and that helium is transported to the surface by meridional circulation currents .",
    "further evidence in favor of a high rotational velocity comes from the flat bottomed shape of the line series observed with _",
    "euve_.    our results do not exclude a helium abundance half as high as in gd  50 .",
    "however , because a spectrum is only detected in the sw , we can not exclude the alternate possibility of a much lower helium abundance . also , since the lines are not detected because of the high column density , no direct evidence exists of rapid rotation other than a possible helium abundance comparable to gd  50 .",
    "finally , a determination of the magnetic field strength may allow a distinction between lineages with the massive dap pg 1658 + 441 ( schmidt et al . 1992 ) , and those with the non - magnetic massive da gd  50 ( schmidt & smith 1995 ) .",
    "we have presented new spectroscopy of the ultramassive white dwarf euve  j1746706 in the optical and euv range .",
    "we have reported a unique solution for the atmospheric parameters that offers a good fit to the balmer lines and to the euv continuum with @xmath47  k and log  @xmath48 .",
    "an upper limit on the helium abundance at about half the measured abundance in gd  50 results from a modeling of the euv continuum . at this point",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility that euve  j1746706 is similar to gd  50 and that it may represent another example of a merged double - degenerate system . a clear association of gd  50 with euve  j1746706 would emerge from a direct detection of photospheric helium in the latter .",
    "a good approach would be to look for the @xmath494686 line in high - dispersion spectra .",
    "an independent constraint on the neutral hydrogen column in the local ism would clarify the ambiguity between ism attenuation and photospheric helium absorption found in euv data ; a high - resolution hubble space telescope spectrum of the ly@xmath50 range may provide such a constraint .",
