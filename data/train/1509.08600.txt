    "let the heart makes a pulsation and the blood wave start to propagate in the artery .",
    "this can be modelled by a half a period of the periodic wave solution of eq.([a19 ] ) .",
    "when the next pulsation comes one can stop at the corresponding values of @xmath112 and its derivatives and can treat them as the new initial conditions .",
    "these new initial conditions describe slightly different periodic wave .",
    "half a period of this wave can be used to model the blood flow wave up to the moment of the next pulsation . at this moment",
    "the reached values of @xmath112 and its derivatives are again the initial conditions that describe the blood wave corresponding to the third pulsation , etc .",
    "in such a way a sequence of slightly different waves ( shown in fig.2 . )    ) by the algorithm described in the text . it may seem that a single wave is shown at the figure .",
    "actually the wave is constructed by the parts of 3 different periodic solutions of eq.([a19 ] ) .",
    "namely it is assumed that the first pulsation started at @xmath137 with initial conditions @xmath141 and",
    "@xmath139 ; @xmath140 .",
    "the second pulsation was at @xmath147 with initial conditions @xmath148 ; @xmath149 ; @xmath150 and @xmath151 ; @xmath152 .",

    "may model the slight irregularity of the heart activity .",
    "it is well known that the time intervals between the heart pulsations are long - range correlated and this is one of the numerous arising of long - range correlations in various systems @xcite - @xcite .",
    "such long - range correlated pseudorandom sequences modeling heart activity may be generated by a computer program and the values in the sequence will determine the end of the corresponding wave train and the beginning of the next wave train .",
    "this was realized in fig.2 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the area of research on blood flow is a large area for application of the methods of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "even the relative single problems such as investigation of waves in large arteries ( where the fluid can be treated as newtonian and the long - wave approximation significantly simplifies the equations ) lead to relatively complicated model equations such as the discussed above variable coefficient kdv equation .",
    "we have stressed that the solitary wave solution of the model equation requires very specific initial conditions and relationship among the two model parameters .",
    "because of this the probability for realization of this solution is small .",
    "we have discussed another kind of solutions of the nonlinear model equation that are much more probable for realization : they do not require relationship between the two parameters of the model and are robust against change of the initial conditions due to the irregularities of the pulsation dynamics of the heart .",
    "these solutions are the periodic solutions of the system of equations ( [ a20 ] ) .",
    "using parts of these solutions one can construct a model profile of a blood waves that reflect the irregularities and the long - range correlations presented in the pulsation activity of human heart .",
