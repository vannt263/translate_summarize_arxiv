    "in the last few years various accurate experimental observations shed new light on the remarkable physics associated to the fabry - prot interferometer ( fpi ) of integer and fractional quantum hall edge channels @xcite . depending on the size of the interference loop",
    "two distinct regimes have been achieved . for a small enough loop area",
    ", intra - edge interaction plays an essential role and features related to coulomb blockade occur . in the opposite regime of large central area , the expected aharonov - bohm physics of free electrons is recovered in the integer quantum hall regime . a consistent theoretical interpretation of these results as well as a characterization of the crossover between these two limits has been proposed @xcite .",
    "various experimental techniques , including gates and ohmic contacts , have been introduced in order to enhance the screening of interaction extending as much as possible the domain of validity of the aharonov - bohm regime , where the interaction is negligible and the simple free particles picture seems adequate to properly explain the experimental observations .    however , very recently , new measurements carried out by choi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have suggested that a richer phenomenology occurs also in this apparently trivial case . in particular , when only one channel is transmitted throughout the fpi , by increasing the number of channels trapped in the loop ( namely the integer filling factor of the system ) , one moves from the standard aharonov - bohm effect of electrons ( at filling factor @xmath1 ) to a more puzzling situation in which a pair of electrons seems to interfere ( at filling factor @xmath2 ) .",
    "this phenomenology has been deduced from both the halving of the periodicity of the conductance with respect to the aharonov - bohm flux and the doubling of the effective outgoing charge measured through shot noise .",
    "these two independent measurements seem to confirm the robustness of the result , moreover various experimental checks have been carried out in order to rule out other possible effects leading to similar phenomenology like the suppression of odd winding of the interferometer with respect to the even ones , leaving the mutual interaction among the channels as the principal candidate to cause this peculiar pairing effect .",
    "aim of this paper is to provide the proper theoretical background for the description of the experimental setup in ref . in the framework of the edge - magnetoplasmon scattering matrix formalism @xcite where the two points electron green s function ( first order electron coherence @xcite ) , crucial ingredient to calculate transport properties like conductance and noise , explicitly depends on the transmission of the bosonic mode across the interferometer . as simplest possible case we will assume a strong screened coulomb interaction and we will investigate carefully the functional form of the scattering matrix as a function of the number of channels trapped into the fpi loop . we will discuss in detail the case of one trapped channel extrapolating then the behavior in case of more channels into the interfering loop .",
    "the consequences of the form of these scattering matrices on the current and the conductance will be then investigated .",
    "even if this simple academic model is not enough to explain what observed in experiments , the derived formalism is very powerful and will allow to extend the analysis towards more realistic models in which finite length of the interaction and dissipations have to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we discuss the edge - magnetoplasmon scattering matrix theory for a fpi as a function of the number of integer hall edge channels trapped into the loop .",
    "we focus in particular on a strong short range ( @xmath3-like ) screened coulomb potential .",
    "the classical and quantum contributions to the current and the associated differential conductance are derived in section [ current ] by means of the kubo formula .",
    "the plots of these quantities , as well as the relevant comments concerning the behavior of the system as a function of the number of trapped channels are reported in section [ results ] , also in view of a possible interpretation of the experimental observations . in section [ ohmic ]",
    "we investigate the role played by an ohmic contact absorbing some of the channels , analogous to the one used in realistic setup , in terms of a simple model based only on the energy conservation .",

    "despite this formal divergence , this exponential suppression still survives at finite temperature .",
    "moreover , the classical and quantum contribution to the current scale in a different way with respect to the voltage , namely i^cl_b&&_0^^(n , k)_aa+^(n , k)_bb+e_a+e_a-1 + i^q_b&&_0^^(n , k)_aa+^(n , k)_bb-1 .",
    "in the present paper we have discussed the physics of a fpi in the integer quantum hall regime . motivated by very recent experiments , we focused on a system at filling factor @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) where only one edge channel is transmitted across the sample , while the other @xmath0 are trapped into the interferometer loop . due to screening , the only residual interaction effect is given by a strong short range inter - channel interaction that we described in terms of the edge - magnetoplasmon scattering matrix formalism .",
    "the major effects associated to the presence of interacting trapped channels are : a renormalisation of the tunneling amplitudes affecting in exactly the same way the classical and the quantum contribution to the current , an evident damped and oscillatory behavior of the differential conductance in contrast to the constant ( ohmic ) behavoir observed in absence of trapped channels and an additional phase shift in the aharonov - bohm periodicity that is clearly visible in the differential conductance at zero bias .",
    "we have also discussed a simple model for a system in which @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) channels in the loop are absorbed by an ohmic contact , based only on the energy conservation .",
    "here we observed that , as long as the energy is not conserved due to losses into the contact , the quantum contribution to the conductance is strongly suppressed and only the classical contribution survives , showing a non - universal power - law behavior reminiscent of the element of the effective edge - magnetoplasmon scattering matrix .",
    "it is worth to note that our simple analysis is not able to provide explanations of the puzzling pairing effect observed in experiments .",
    "however , the developed formalism is general enough to include possible dissipative and non - gaussian effects that could be relevant in this direction .",
    "we thanks i. p. levkivskyi , e. idrisov , a. borin and a. goremykina for useful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge the financial support of swiss national science foundation .",
    "aim of this appendix is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the functions @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) defined in the main text . according to the integral representation",
    "f ( , a)=^+_0 ( 1- e^-i ) e^-a= ( 1 + i ) and recalling the fourier series expansion of @xmath80 and @xmath81 in eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and ( [ j ] ) one obtains      the above series converge quite fast and are helpful both in the numeric evaluation of the integrals for the current and in order to obtain asymptotic expressions under the natural condition @xmath136 .",
