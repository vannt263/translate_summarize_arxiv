    "after more than 13 years of unprecedented quality helioseismic observations , we have not been able to measure acoustic modes below @xmath3  1  mhz ( e.g. broomhall et al .",
    "2007 ) or gravity modes .",
    "indeed , only the asymptotic properties of these modes have been uncovered ( garca et al .",
    "2007 , 2008a ) , but the measurements of individual modes is still a challenge of modern solar physics ( e.g. mathur et al . 2007 ; appourchaux these proceedings ) .",
    "it will be impossible to properly determine the structure and dynamic of the solar core without these modes ( e.g. garca et al .",
    "2008b ; mathur et al .",
    "2008 ) as well as the high - penetrative , high - order , low - degree p modes ( garca , mathur , & ballot 2008 ) . in order to progress towards lower frequencies ,",
    "we need to develop new instrumentation  e.g. the golf - ng project ( salabert et al .",
    "these proceedings ) , but also to better combine the existent data as well as to improve the analyzing techniques .    as the frequency decreases , the amplitude of the modes decreases while the background level increases .",
    "this background noise is a combination of convective noise , instrumental noise , and , in the case of ground - based stations , of the terrestrial atmosphere .",
    "combining data from different instruments has the advantage to reduce the instrumental noise as well as the convective noise , since each instrument observes at a different height of the solar atmosphere and the convection is not fully correlated ( garca et al .",
    "2004b ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work , we use 4472-day time series  from april  11 , 1996 to july  8 , 2008  calibrated into velocity ( garca et al . 2005 ) of the disk - integrated , sun - as - a - star golf / soho instrument ( gabriel et al .",
    "1995 ) , and 3620-day velocity time series  from april  11 , 1996 to march  9 , 2006  of the spatially - resolved , ground - based gong network ( harvey et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we average the golf observations with the gong time series from each @xmath4-component ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) of the spherical harmonic projection of the @xmath7 mode , both being filtered by a backwards difference filter ( bdf ) .",
    "then , we compute the fourier transform of each multiplet component with a five times zero padding , correct for the effect of the bdf filter ( garca & ballot 2008 ) and finally average the power spectrum density . the length of the combined series is 3620 days .",
    "the combined power spectrum does not present the daily harmonics thanks to the high duty cycle of the space - based golf instrument .",
    "moreover , the leakage from high - degree modes is reduced because they are not present in the golf spectra .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath8 modes increases as they are present in both spectra as well as the overall snr .",
    "for example , the mode @xmath8 , @xmath9 has a larger snr in the combined ( golf+gong ) data set than in golf data alone , even when using 20% shorter time series ( see fig .  1 ) ,",
    "while the mode @xmath8 , @xmath10 has a slightly smaller snr .",
    "we applied the collapsogram technique ( salabert et al . 2007 ) to the @xmath7 combined ( golf+gong ) 3620-day time series .",
    "several more low - degree modes in the low - frequency range can be then observed than using the collapsograms applied only to the gong ( or mdi ) data , such as the @xmath7 , @xmath9 mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colp ] ) .",
    "moreover , the combination of golf with gong increases the overall snr , allowing us to measure p modes which would not have a snr high enough to be measured in golf only .    ,",
    "@xmath9 mode at @xmath11 959.83  @xmath12hz measured with the collapsogram technique applied to the combined ( golf+gong ) 3620-day time series . estimated splitting @xmath13 = 387.8  nhz . ]",
    "this preliminary analysis shows the advantage of combining observations from spatially - resolved helioseismic instruments and disk - integrated , sun - as - a - star instruments . the noise level in the low - frequency range",
    "is reduced and the snr of the low - degree modes is increased .",
    "moreover , when combining ground - based data with space - based data , there is no signal coming from the daily harmonics .",
    "the snr of the combined data is greater than the snr of only one instrument even with a longer time series . with the present ( mdi , gong , golf ,",
    "bison ) and future ( hmi , picard , golf - ng ) available helioseismic databases , the combination of observations obtained from spatially - resolved and sun - as - a - star instruments can be of great interest in the search of the solar low - frequency acoustic and gravity modes .",
    "this work has been partially founded by the spanish grant pnaya2007 - 62650 and the cnes / golf grant at the sap - cea / saclay .",
    "soho is an international cooperation between esa and nasa .",
    "this work utilizes data obtained by the global oscillation network group ( gong ) program , managed by the national solar observatory , which is operated by aura , inc . under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "the data were acquired by instruments operated by the big bear solar observatory , high altitude observatory , learmonth solar observatory , udaipur solar observatory , instituto de astrofsica de canarias , and cerro tololo interamerican observatory .",

    "<S> in the case of spatially - revolved helioseismic data ( such as mdi , gong , hmi ) , the usual mode - fitting analysis consists of fitting the 2@xmath0 + 1 individual @xmath1-spectra of a given multiplet ( @xmath2 ) either individually or simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> such fitting methods fail to obtain reliable estimates of the mode parameters ( frequency , splitting , ... ) when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is low , which makes those methods not suitable when one wants to look at the low - amplitude , long - lived solar p modes in the low - frequency range . instead , salabert et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2007 ) developed a new method to extract the mode parameters by adjusting the rotation- and structure - induced frequency shift for each @xmath1-spectrum to minimize the mode width in the @xmath1-averaged spectrum ( a  collapsogram \" ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-averaged spectrum technique , applied to the spatially - resolved gong and mdi data , appeared to be a powerful tool for low snr modes in the low - frequency range . another possibility to increase the snr is to combine data from different instruments ( garca et al . </S>",

    "<S> we present here an adaptation of both techniques : the  collapsograms \" applied to a combination of observations from a sun - as - a - star instrument , golf , and a disk - imaged one , gong . </S>"
