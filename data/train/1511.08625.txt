    "materials with transition metal elements are of great interests due to a large variety of physical properties : high - temperature superconductivity in copper and iron based compounds  @xcite , giant magnetoresistance  @xcite , metal - to - insulator transition  @xcite and many others .",
    "this diversity comes mainly from the facts that _",
    "i ) _ the local coulomb interaction of the 3@xmath0 ions is comparable with its bandwidth and _ ii ) _ the @xmath0 orbitals are partially filled . these compounds with competing kinetic and interacting energies",
    "can hardly be described by the conventional density functional theory ( dft ) and are known as strongly correlated .",
    "the elemental 3@xmath0 metals with partially occupied shell are not exceptions .",
    "the famous 6  ev satellite in nickel  @xcite is of many body nature and can not be described by a band structure theory  @xcite .",
    "an application of the state of the art dft+dmft method  @xcite , that combines material specific aspects of the dft and dynamical mean field theory  @xcite ( dmft ) to treat correlated electrons , allowed to lichtenstein  @xcite describe properly electronic and magnetic properties of iron and nickel in ferro- and paramagnetic phases .",
    "grechnev  @xcite , di marco  @xcite , koloren  @xcite and minr  @xcite studied spectral properties of ni and found that correlation effects play an important role in forming satellite structure and renormalize the exchange splitting .",
    "benea  @xcite calculated magnetic compton profiles of ni and fe in dft+dmft approach and found that an inclusion of electronic correlations improves significantly an agreement between the theoretical and experimental results .",
    "leonov  in series of papers  @xcite investigated a paramagnetic iron at ambient pressure as function of temperature and found that a complete picture of phase transformations can be done when correlation effects are taken into account .",
    "pourovskii  @xcite studied magnetic and thermodynamic properties of iron at high pressure and concluded that correlations are important for phase stability .",
    "in this view , an account for strong electron - electron interaction is required to investigate physical properties of  alloy , which was intensively studied due to the invar effect discovered more than hundred years ago  @xcite .",
    "one should note that a chemical disorder present in alloy complicates additionally a problem of a first principles description of materials .",
    "nevertheless , different techniques to treat alloying effects are well developed in framework of dft . in one of the most used methods , a large supercell with randomly distributed atoms of different types",
    "is constructed , and then , required properties can be evaluated from calculations for ordered structures . in a coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , a real crystal with randomly distributed ions is replaced by an effective medium with an energy - dependent self - energy that has to be determined self - consistently ( for recent reviews see  [ ] or [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "magnetic properties of  alloy as function of composition and volume were studied by several groups using both above mentioned approaches in the dft framework .",
    "a rather complete review of these works can be found in paper of abrikosov  @xcite who also found that a family of magnetic states are close to each other in energy and concluded that inclusion of strong electron - electron correlations is highly desired to reveal the physics of this alloy .",
    "albeit the pure iron and nickel are successfully studied by means of dft+dmft method , there are only few papers devoted to .",
    "minr  @xcite combined a korringa - kohn - rostoker multiple scattering theory with the dynamical mean field theory and coherent potential approximation to treat substitutional disorder . for a solution of the effective impurity problem in dmft they used fluctuation exchange approximation  @xcite in conjunction with @xmath1-matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "the authors found that a band broadening due to correlation effects and disorder is comparable in face centered cubic structure ( fcc ) of  below curie temperature .",
    "total magnetic moment is decreased as function of ni concentration .",
    "the individual magnetic moments for iron ( nickel ) are slightly overestimated ( underestimated )  @xcite with respect to experimental values that can be connected to the perturbation nature of the impurity solver in dmft .",
    "vekilova  @xcite investigated different phases of ordered fe@xmath2ni@xmath3 alloy at high pressure using dft+dmft method with continuous time quantum monte - carlo as the impurity solver  @xcite . for a body centered cubic structure ,",
    "a uniform magnetic susceptibility has a curie - weiss - like behavior , which changes to a pauli - type in a hexagonal close packed structure .",
    "they found that a strength of electronic correlations on the fe 3@xmath0 orbitals is sensitive to the phase and local environment .    in this work",
    ", we study the magnetic properties of iron - rich fcc  binary alloy as function of composition and temperature . to this aim ,",

    "the hamiltonian of a crystal with a chemical type of disorder can be written as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron on site @xmath7 with orbital @xmath8 and spin @xmath9 . @xmath10 .",

    "the on - site potential , @xmath13 , and the coulomb matrix , @xmath15 , depend on site index @xmath7 and they are different for different atomic species @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) or @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , depending on atom remaining on site @xmath7 with the probability @xmath20 or @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",

    "the above hubbard - type hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can not be solved directly due to a simultaneous presence of the disorder and interaction . at the same time , the solutions of limiting cases , though approximate , are known . in the non - interacting limit",
    ", a coherent potential approximation  @xcite is utilized to describe the chemically disordered crystals . in the cpa , an electron propagation through the substitutionally disordered material",
    "is replaced by its propagation through an effective medium defined self - consistently . other limiting case  absence of disorder ( one type of atoms ) ",
    "is known as the hubbard model .",
    "one of the best single site approximation for its solution is the dynamical mean field theory  @xcite . in this theory",
    "the lattice problem is replaced by an effective impurity embedded in an energy dependent effective medium .",

    "( [ eq : scf_conditions ] ) can be used to compute a self - energy from the dyson s equation : @xmath33 one should emphasize that the obtained self - energy contains effects from the disorder and correlations simultaneously .",

    "the second reason of overestimation originates from a density - density form of the coulomb interaction in a segment version of ct - qmc algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the better agreement for the curie temperature at high nickel content is attributed with lesser importance of spin - flip and pair hopping terms in an almost filled @xmath0 shell  @xcite .",
