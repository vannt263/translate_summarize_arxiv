    "epidemic models take a variety of mathematical forms  , and are are now routinely used to inform policy on disease control and contribute towards public health plans  @xcite .",
    "one of the most commonly investigated forms of models are susceptible - infectious - removed ( sir ) , in which everyone is either susceptible to the disease , infectious with it , or removed from the future disease dynamics .",
    "this model is a simplification of reality , but provides a useful starting point for modelling diseases where previous infection confers long - lasting immunity , for example outbreaks of childhood diseases like measles , some respiratory illnesses like pandemic influenza , and historical pathogens such as smallpox  .",
    "simple models of epidemics have assumed that all members of a population interact at a homogeneous rate and therefore that at a given time every susceptible has an equal probability of contracting the disease from any infectious individual .",
    "a more realistic way to think of the spread of diseases can be that they spread through contacts between people , with these contacts describing a network of interactions . in the case of homogeneous mixing",
    "this network is under some conditions an erds - rnyi ( er ) random graph .",
    "there have been many examples of using networks to study the spread of disease and two review papers  @xcite compare several different approaches to network modelling .",
    "longstanding generalisations of homogeneous mixing epidemic dynamics include heterogeneous network models  @xcite and regular clustered networks  @xcite .",
    "regularity ( each individual having exactly @xmath0 links ) is appropriate for some populations ( and was originally motivated by spatially embedded ecological and veterinary applications ) but for human respiratory transmission  @xcite and sexually transmitted infections  @xcite , this is almost definitely inaccurate and the contact network is highly degree - heterogeneous . in this work ,",
    "we represent heterogeneity in degree using what has become a _ de facto _ standard : the configuration model  @xcite .",
    "as relevant theory has developed , through moment - closure approximations and other methods  @xcite , the use of heterogeneous networks has become more and more common in the literature .",
    "several areas of interest for epidemics have been studied .",
    "the invasion threshold of the infection has been calculated  @xcite , and involves the mean and variance of the degree distribution .",
    "the final size of an epidemic with a given degree distribution along with the mean degree of the individuals infected has been derived  @xcite . in particular",
    "we note the use of a probability generating function  @xcite to derive a small number of nonlinear odes that describe the dynamics of a sir infection on a random heterogeneous network .",
    "in most cases where networks are used they are static , i.e.  decided at one point in time and fixed that way rather than changing over time , though there are several examples where this assumption is not made  @xcite .",
    "there are also examples of networks on which the individuals have heterogeneous degree and are always changing contacts  @xcite , although there is some precedence for this modelling framework before the widespread use of networks as a conceptual tool  @xcite .",
    "though the extremes of static or extremely dynamic networks are obviously unrealistic , they are useful to enable some analytic traction and also increase the ease with which we can simulate . more recently though there have been attempts to include some additional way of passing on the disease rather than just through the defined links of the network in an attempt to describe the fact that diseases can be passed between members of the population that do not have more than one interaction , i.e.  a ` global ' infection term  @xcite",
    ".    observed epidemics are noisy and unpredictable , which motivates the use of stochastic epidemic models  @xcite .",
    "while some asymptotic results for invasion and final size of stochastic epidemics on networks can be derived in a discrete - time branching process framework , if one is interested in transient dynamics then the natural model is an appropriate continuous time markov chain . for an sir - type epidemic model on an arbitrary graph with @xmath1 nodes ,",
    "such a markov chain would involve @xmath2 odes , which quickly becomes computationally intractable .",
    "the method proposed by ball and neal  @xcite involves creating a configuration model network at the same time as the epidemic tree , and this stochastic process manifestly asymptotically converges on @xmath3 odes in the deterministic large @xmath1 limit , where @xmath4 is the maximum number of contacts that the most well connected individual on a network has .",
    "unfortunately , this can still be very large depending on the exact degree distribution and any attempt to cut down the number of equations by ignoring individuals who have more than a given number of neighbours , will inevitably ignore some of the most important individuals for the dynamics .",
    "fortunately , recent work  @xcite has shown that a more sophisticated convergence proof leads to the smaller equation set of  @xcite .",
    "the desire to model stochasticity without a massive increase in dimensionality has led researchers to consider the diffusion limit .",
    "this general approach to stochastic processes is typically either attributed to van kampen  @xcite or kurtz  @xcite , but the basic idea is that provided that our population is sufficiently large , we can approximate the markov process that describes the epidemic by a deterministic model together with appropriately scaled white noise processes that are defined by the transition rates between the states of the markov chain .",
    "such methods have been used to derive a low dimensional model in which properties of the noise in a stochastic epidemic model can be investigated analytically  @xcite , by ross  @xcite to obtain expressions for the mean and variance of a metapopulation model , and by colizza et al .",
    "@xcite to model the effect of air travel on the spread of epidemics in a large - scale network .",
    "these models are attractive since they have the same dimensionality as the deterministic limit , but are actually stochastic , and corrections to the approximation are @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper we will apply the results of kurtz to sir - type epidemic dynamics on a configuration model network , as was done for sis dynamics on a regular graph by dangerfield et al .",
    "@xcite . using this",
    "we obtain a four - dimensional set of stochastic odes , from which we derive an analytical expression for the variance of the asymptotic early growth of an epidemic on a network given its degree distribution .",
    "we provide an argument that our approach is asymptotically exact , and simulate epidemics on various networks to confirm the utility of our analytical results .",
    "the use of networks as a generalisation from homogeneous mixing is becoming one of the most widely used in epidemiological modelling .",
    "contact between two individuals of the population we are considering forms a link between them . once a link is established , the infection can be passed along it in either direction .",
    "specifically what contact is represented depends on the disease , i.e.  it is different for a respiratory infection compared to a sexually transmitted infection .",
    "these differences will affect how the contact network is constructed , but we use a common modelling framework once the network is known .",
    "the network can be described by a symmetric @xmath6 matrix @xmath7 , which has binary entries , @xmath8 , where the entry @xmath9 will be 1 if nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 have a link between them and 0 otherwise .",
    "we do not allow self links in the network or multiple links between nodes .",
    "we make the simplifying assumptions that all links are of equal strength and that once a link is made it will be there throughout the spread of the epidemic .",
    "the degree distribution of a network , @xmath12 , specifies what the probability is that a node selected uniformly at random will have @xmath13 neighbours . to construct an uncorrelated network with a given degree distribution , @xmath12 , the configuration model is used  @xcite .",
    "the method for this is as follows :    * each member of the population @xmath10 is given a number of  half - links \" or ",
    "stubs \" , @xmath14 , which is drawn from the degree distribution @xmath12 .",
    "once this is done we can define @xmath15 to be the proportion of nodes in the network that have @xmath13 neighbours .",
    "* pairs of stubs are then picked uniformly at random and are then joined up forming an undirected edge between the two corresponding vertices .    later in the paper ,",
    "when we simulate an epidemic on a network , this is the method that is used to create a network with the degree distribution that we require .",
    "asymptotically , the differences due to different ways of dealing with repeated- and self - edges will be @xmath5 .",
    "our choice for how to deal with these in a finite system is to obtain a list of all the nodes which have multiple connections between them and self - edges .",
    "one by one , the extra links between nodes will be broken , say between node @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and then a randomly selected and connected pair of nodes will also be selected , say nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we then connect @xmath10 and @xmath16 together and @xmath11 and @xmath17 together , which leaves the degree distribution unaltered .",
    "this is then repeated until there are no repeated- and self - edges .",
    "we assume a population of @xmath1 individuals on a configuration model network .",
    "individuals are stratified by their disease state @xmath18 , @xmath19 , or @xmath20 , and their degree on the network @xmath13 .",
    "individuals of type @xmath21 become @xmath22 at a rate equal to the product of the transmission rate @xmath23 and their number of infectious neighbours .",
    "individuals of type @xmath22 become @xmath24 at a rate @xmath25 .",
    "we are interested in the large @xmath1 regime , in which we write @xmath26 $ ] for the expected number of susceptibles of degree @xmath13 , @xmath27 $ ] for the expected number of infectious individuals of degree @xmath13 , and @xmath28 $ ] for the number of connected pairs of individuals on the network where one is type @xmath29 and the other is type @xmath30 .",
    "omission of a subscript denotes implicit summation , e.g. @xmath31 = \\sum_k [ s_k]$ ] .",
    "to derive pairwise equations , we require knowledge of the neighbourhood of each node . this is due to the fact that when an infection or recovery takes place the number of pairs of type @xmath28 $ ] will be changed in a way which is dependent on the neighbours that the node has .",
    "this is why it is not straightforward to write down a low - dimensional form for this process as the population size becomes large , since this requires the distribution of neighbours of each node .",
    "we therefore make the following assumption , that we will justify below : the distribution of neighbourhoods with @xmath32 susceptibles and @xmath33 infectious individuals around a susceptible individual of degree @xmath13 , is a multinomial with probabilities that do not depend on @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath34 where , @xmath35}{\\sum_k k [ s_k ] } \\mbox { , } q_s = \\frac{[s i]}{\\sum_k k [ s_k ] }   \\label{eqn : connection_probabilities}\\text { .}\\ ] ] here the term @xmath36 , is the multinomial coefficient .",
    "we have not detailed an assumption for the neighbourhoods of infected nodes here , as this requires more care to be taken .",
    "this will be detailed later , and will be denoted by @xmath37 . with these assumptions , it is possible to reduce the state space of the markov chain dramatically .",
    "in fact , a closed system is obtained that is of dimension four . the insight that allows",
    "this dimensional reduction is from  @xcite , although our model uses pairwise notation and is derived explicitly from applying the results of kurtz to an underlying stochastic process .",
    "we note that @xmath38 ( where @xmath15 , as defined above , is the proportion of nodes with degree @xmath13 ) is the probability generating function ( pgf ) of the degree distribution",
    ". we also define and keep track of the variable @xmath39 in our dynamical system .",
    "@xmath39 is defined to be the proportion of degree one nodes that are still susceptible at time @xmath40 .",
    "infection down each link is assumed to be independent , which implies that the probability that a node of degree @xmath13 being susceptible at time @xmath40 will be @xmath41 .",
    "we can then write the number of degree @xmath13 nodes that are still susceptible at time @xmath40 as @xmath26 = n d_k \\theta(t)^k$ ] .",
    "if there are no degree one nodes in the population , then we can think of @xmath39 in terms of its relationship with degree @xmath13 nodes .",
    "it is the @xmath42-th power of the probability that a randomly chosen degree @xmath13 node is susceptible .",
    "we also note that many important features of the network can be written simply using the pgf .",
    "in particular : @xmath43 = [ s ]   $ ] , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the mean number of links per node .    to construct the deterministic limit of the epidemic on the large network ( called the fluid limit by some )",
    ", we must consider the change in the variables of our system due to an event .",
    "for the sir model our events are infections of susceptibles and recoveries of infecteds .",
    "as we are considering the epidemic on a network , to fully describe the events , we are interested in how many neighbours someone has who are infectious and susceptible . keeping this in mind",
    "we therefore consider two types of events .",
    "the first type of event is a susceptible of degree @xmath13 , who has @xmath32 susceptible neighbours and @xmath33 infected neighbours , becoming infected , i.e. going from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the second is an infected individual of degree @xmath13 , who has @xmath32 susceptible neighbours , recovering from the infection , i.e. going from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",

    "then the process is defined to take @xmath134 running this process until the absorbing state @xmath135 gives the adjacency matrix of a configuration model network , although depending on what one decides about repeated- or self - edges , different corrections of @xmath5 may arise  @xcite .    in the _ epidemic process _ , individuals have non - independent random variables for their state @xmath136 , that can take values @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath20",
    ". then @xmath137 and infectious nodes recover at rate @xmath25 . the fundamental insight from ball and neal",
    "@xcite is that these two processes can be combined . in this construction ,",
    "every node in the network is given a number of half - links , which are then paired up as the epidemic progresses to form contacts between individuals in the following two ways :    * an infected with @xmath125 remaining half - links makes contacts at rate @xmath138 ; if it links to a susceptible then the infection will be transmitted with probability 1 .",
    "* when an infected recovers ( which happens at rate @xmath25 ) all of its remaining half - links will be independently paired off with remaining half - links in the population .",
    "the question of what a susceptible neighbourhood looks like at a given time in this picture is answered by halting the epidemic process , and running the configuration model process to completion , then counting the neihbours of each susceptible . as noted by decreusefond et al .",
    "@xcite ( who use a slightly different construction but the same basic idea ) at finite @xmath1 this gives each susceptible a multivariate hypergeometric neighbourhood , as they sample without replacement from the population . as @xmath1 becomes large , this tends to a multinomial distribution with corrections @xmath5 .",
    "a similar argument can be made for the neighbourhood around an infectious individual , in terms of its links that remain unpaired . in the absence of susceptible depletion , it is then possible to make a stochastic version of the deterministic argument about the neighbourhood around an infective in ",
    "[ sec : ninf ] above .",
    "since the diffusion limit deals with terms of @xmath139 and ignores terms of @xmath5 , we are therefore justified in making the multinomial assumption for the neighourhood around a susceptible .",
    "we note that it therefore implies the exactness of several other deterministic approaches in the absence of clustering , such as the pairwise closure techniques from @xcite and the maximum entropy moment closure method of rogers  @xcite .",
    "as described above we can solve for @xmath90 .",
    "we did this through computer algebra , due to the complexity of expressions involved .",
    "the variance of the number of infecteds during early growth is shown in full in appendix a. this can be simplified in the certain regimes . if we define the time at which the epidemic grows at the rate predicted in @xcite as @xmath140 , and the time at which the depletion of susceptibles affects the growth rate and we leave the early growth phase at @xmath141 , then when the current time satisfies @xmath142 , we can simplify the expression in appendix a. we note that this regime will exist in an infinite size network if the initial amount of infection in the network @xmath81 is sufficiently small .",
    "it is dominated by a single term which involves the mean , variance and skew of the networks degree distribution along with the recovery and transmission rates of the infection . in this limit ,",
    "the mean and variance of prevalence obey @xmath143 where @xmath81 is a constant related to the prevalence of infection as the early asymptotic behaviour commences at @xmath140 , and @xmath114 .",
    "figure  [ fig : skew_t_inf ] shows how the variance in prevalence changes as skew in degree increases . seeing that as the skew increases we get an increase in the variance of the epidemic during early growth",
    ", we would therefore see that if we had a network whose degree distribution is a power law , would show greater variation than a negative binomially distributed network with the same mean and variance would show .",
    "we think of this increase in variation being caused by the members of the population who are very well connected in the network .",
    "these people have been called super - spreaders in the past .",
    "if the disease reaches these people in the early growth phase of the epidemic then we can expect a rapid increase in disease prevalence , as there will be many @xmath57 $ ] pairs through which the disease can be passed , whilst if they do not get it in this early phase , there will not be this rapid increase , which generates the large variance in this stage of the epidemic . we note that for the @xmath81 term in we have no analytical traction on what this should be for a given epidemic . if we wish to compare this result to simulation , we will fit the value of @xmath81 so that the analytical prediction and the simulated results agree at a given point .",
    "as this is simply multiplied by the other terms , fitting it simply scales the prediction up or down rather than fine tuning the prediction itself .",
    "we have also used simulation to test our conclusion that if we fix the mean and variance of the degree distribution , but have different skew values , then the network which has the higher value of skew will also exhibit a higher variance of infecteds during the early growth period .",
    "we wish to see whether we get a match between the analytical result that we have obtained and the simulated result .",
    "there are several difficulties to achieving this that we wish to note .",
    "first , the networks are extremely large in the case of the analytical results and we do not know how exactly fast the convergence to the answer should be ( although the corrections are @xmath5 we do not know what prefactors multiply this term ) .",
    "we have run our simulations on networks of size @xmath144 , representing a small city , which in the end seemed sufficient .",
    "secondly , the analytical results only work for the early growth phase of the infection , which can be defined as the time when the pool of susceptibles is not significantly depleted .",
    "whilst in an arbitrarily large network this can last for an arbitrarily long time , in a finite network , this is not true and will vary depending on the degree distribution of the network .",
    "this means that if we want to compare the early growth variance of two networks , we may have a very brief window in which we can actually do it .",
    "this is exacerbated by the fact that we will have to allow for a period at the very beginning of the epidemic to be discounted , as we want the system to approach some sort of early asymptotic behaviour unaffected by the random selection of initial infected .    finally , there were also several assumptions made for the analytical system such as how the number of triples in the network can be approximated by doubles and the pgf @xmath145 . with the finite network that we construct",
    "there is no guarantee that this will be accurate ; again , convergence is @xmath5 but we do not have knowledge of the prefactors .",
    "we implemented the gillespie algorithm  @xcite to simulate the time evolution of the epidemic , on networks of size @xmath144 . to obtain the correct mean early growth behaviour , we allow each simulation to achieve a certain number of infections ( @xmath146 ) and then we set the simulation time to zero and let the epidemic progress from there . by allowing this initial amount of infection we will be able to absorb the initial conditions that we choose and get to the average behaviour of the system . in the system of size",
    "@xmath144 , allowing @xmath146 infections is also small enough that the susceptibles will not be depleted significantly enough to affect the rate of growth of the epidemic .",
    "we ran @xmath147 simulations on two networks with the same mean and variance but with different skewness .",
    "we note that the same networks were used for each of the @xmath147 simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : compare_sim_to_theory ] shows the result of these simulations compared with the prediction given by in appendix a. we can see that as predicted the network with the higher skew exhibits more variance in number of infecteds in the early growth stage and also we see that the analytical prediction for what the variance should be , is a good fit for what the simulations show .",
    "the early time disagreement is as we would expect , since this is when the @xmath5 corrections should be most significant .",
    "we have considered the spread of sir - type infections on networks of heterogenous degree . using the assumption that the neighbourhood around a node will have a distribution of susceptibles and infecteds which is multinomial , we have derived a low dimension deterministic approximation to the stochastic dynamics of the infection which we can write down precisely in the form given by equation .",
    "a heuristic argument has been given to justify this assumption in the large @xmath1 regime .",
    "computer algebra was then used to calculate the covariance matrix of our model using an equation derived by kurtz .",
    "this was then used to give us the variance of the early growth of the epidemic on the network and we extracted the dominant term in the @xmath142 regime which is given by .",
    "these analytic results were derived for networks of extremely large size .    by comparing the solution that was derived analytically with simulations ,",
    "we have been able to demonstrate that with a network of size @xmath144 we can get a strong agreement between the two as can be seen in figure  [ fig : compare_sim_to_theory ] .",
    "we have shown that as the degree skewness of the network increases , so does the variance of the number of infecteds during the early growth .",
    "an implication of this result is that in the situation of an outbreak of a disease , if we are able to target the very well connected people in the network , then we can ( as well as has been previously established ) decrease the impact of the disease efficiently  but such an intervention would also mitigate the ` reasonable worst case scenario ' in how many people will become infected by reducing the variability of the epidemic",
    ".    another potential application of our results is to improve the estimation of epidemiological parameters during early growth of an epidemic .",
    "the possibility of estimating the variability in prevalence , together with a relationship between such variability and underlying model parameters , could enhance statistical work on epidemic prevalence curves .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have shown how a low - dimensional system of stochastic differential equations can be used to describe the diffusion limit of a stochastic epidemic on a heterogeneous network , and have drawn out epidemiological conclusions from this model .",

    "when we do this we get , @xmath180 similarly we get @xmath181 the expectation for the number of invectives in generation @xmath13 follows @xmath182 the law of total variance then tells us that the variance of @xmath22 is given by , @xmath183 using induction this gives us @xmath184 when we substitute in the the expression for the mean and variance of @xmath30 from and respectively , we get , @xmath185 now , letting @xmath13 become large , and setting @xmath186 , @xmath187 , to correspond as closely as possible to continuous - time results , we obtain @xmath188 which is not in agreement with  .",
    "this is as we would expect , because the reasoning in  [ sec : diffmod ] above depends critically on the markovian nature of the dynamics .",
    "in contrast , the branching process can account for non - markovian dynamics , but does not allow for the fact that high - degree infective nodes create new infections more quickly than low - degree infective nodes .",
    "the two approaches are therefore best seen as complementary ."

    "<S> epidemic models currently play a central role in our attempts to understand and control infectious diseases . here , we derive a model for the diffusion limit of stochastic susceptible - infectious - removed ( sir ) epidemic dynamics on a heterogeneous network . using this , we consider analytically the early asymptotic exponential growth phase of such epidemics , showing how the higher order moments of the network degree distribution enter into the stochastic behaviour of the epidemic . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the first three moments of the network degree distribution are needed to specify the variance in disease prevalence fully , meaning that the skewness of the degree distribution affects the variance of the prevalence of infection . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these asymptotic results to simulation and find a close agreement for city - sized populations . </S>"
