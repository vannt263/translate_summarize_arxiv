    "one of the outstanding problems in particle physics is the determination of the structure of hadrons such as the proton and neutron in terms of their fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom . over the past twenty years",
    "two fundamentally different pictures have developed .",
    "one , the constituent quark model is closely related to experimental observation . the other ,",
    "quantum chromodynamics is based on a covariant non - abelian quantum field theory .",
    "the front form ( also known as light - cone quantization ) appears to be the only hope of reconciling these two .",
    "this elegant approach to quantum field theory is a hamiltonian gauge - fixed formulation that avoids many of the most difficult problems in the conventional equal - time formulation of the theory .",
    "the natural gauge for light - cone hamiltonian theories is the light - cone gauge @xmath0 . in this physical gauge",
    "the gluons have only the two physical transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "one imagines that there is an expansion in multi - particle occupation number fock states .",
    "but even in the case of the simpler abelian quantum theory of electrodynamics very little is known about the nature of the bound state solutions in the strong - coupling domain . in the non - abelian quantum theory of chromodynamics a calculation of bound - state structure",
    "has to deal with many difficult aspects simultaneously .",
    "confinement , vacuum structure and chiral symmetry inter - twine with the difficulties of describing a ( relativistic ) many - body system and the non - perturbative renormalization of a hamiltonian .    in the conventional approach based on equal - time quantization",
    "the fock state expansion becomes quickly intractable because of the complexity of the vacuum .",
    "furthermore , boosting such a wavefunction from the hadron s rest frame to a moving frame is as complex a problem as solving the bound state problem itself .",
    "the presence of the square root operator in the equal - time hamiltonian approach presents severe mathematical difficulties .",
    "fortunately ` light - cone quantization ' offers an elegant avenue of escape .",
    "it can be formulated independent of the lorentz frame .",
    "the square root operator does not appear , and the vacuum structure is relatively simple .",
    "there is no spontaneous creation of massive fermions in the light - cone quantized vacuum .",
    "in fact , there are many reasons to quantize relativistic field theories at fixed light - cone time .",
    "dirac @xcite showed , in 1949 , that in this so called ` front form ' of hamiltonian dynamics a maximum number of poincar generators become independent of the interaction , including certain lorentz boosts .",
    "in fact , unlike the traditional equal - time hamiltonian formalism , quantization on a plane tangential to the light - cone , on the ` null plane ' , can be formulated without reference to a specific frame .",
    "one can construct an operator whose eigenvalues are the invariant masses of the composite physical particles .",
    "the eigenvectors describe bound states of arbitrary four - momentum and invariant mass , and allow the computation of scattering amplitudes and other dynamical quantities . in many field theories",
    "the vacuum state of the free hamiltonian is also an eigenstate of the light - cone hamiltonian .",
    "the fock expansion built on this vacuum state provides a complete relativistic many - particle basis for diagonalizing the full theory .",
    "the main thrust of these lectures will be to discuss the complexities that are unique to this formulation of qcd , in varying degrees of detail .",
    "the goal is to present a self - consistent framework rather than trying to cover the subject exhaustively .",
    "a review all of the successes or applications will , however , not be undertaken .",
    "one of the reasons is , that the subject was reviewed recently @xcite .",
    "another is that other lecturers in this school emphasize complementary aspects .",
    "stan brodsky shows how the knowledge of the the light - cone wavefunction has impact on hadronic physics and exclusive processes .",
    "steve pinsky demonstrates how the method of discretized light - cone quantization is constructive for analyzing super - symmetric string and m(atrix ) theories .",
    "last not least , simon dalley expands on the transverse - lattice calculations within the light - cone approach .",
    "comparatively little space will be devoted to canonical field theory , just so much as to plausibilize that a light - cone hamiltonian exists .",
    "this so called ` naive hamiltonian ' will be derived and written down explicitly as a fock - space operator in the light - cone gauge and disregarding zero modes . for historical and paedagogical reasons",
    "these notes will be rather outspoken for one space and one time dimension , mostly to show that periodic boundary conditions ( discretized light - cone quantization ) are helpful , indeed , for solving the bound - state problem in a relativistic theory .",
    "the attempt is made to be complementary to the review @xcite and some new material on the schwinger model is included .    the bulk of these notes deals with the many - body aspects of a gauge field theory in the real world of 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "a hadron not only contains the valence quarks but also an infinite amount of gluons and sea - quarks .",
    "progress often comes with new technologies .",
    "the presentation of the method of iterated resolvents therefore takes broad room .",
    "it allows to derive a well - defined effective interaction . some thus far unpublished work",
    "is included , in particular more instructive examples .",
    "the presentation is separated into two parts . in the first considerations are essentially exact . in the second",
    "some approximations and simplifications are admitted and well marked in the text .",
    "one arrives at the effective interaction in the form of a tractable and solvable integral equation .",
    "its solutions allow to construct explicitly the many - body amplitudes corresponding to see - quarks and gluons by comparatively simple quadratures , without the need of solving another bound - state problem .",
    "explicit equations for that are given .",
    "moreover , some new research work will be included in the section on renormalization .    what is not included in these notes",
    ", however , is a complete survey of the literature .",
    "mostly for the reasons of space , it is refered to the some 469 items of @xcite .",
    "i apologize with my colleagues whose work is not mentioned .",
    "but i will be careful to cite the work which i need for the present discussion and presentation .",
    "some selected monographies which i found useful to consult are @xcite , some selected review articles or conference proceedings might be @xcite .",
    "dirac defines the hamiltonian @xmath1 of a closed system as that operator whose action on the state vector @xmath2 has the same effect as taking the partial derivative with respect to time @xmath3 , _ i.e. _ @xmath4 the concept of an hamiltonian is applicable irrespective of whether one deals with the motion of a non - relativistic particle in classical mechanics or with a non - relativistic wave function in the schrdinger equation , and it generalizes almost unchanged to a relativistic and covariant field theory .    in a covariant theory ,",
    "the very notion of ` time ' becomes , however , questionable since the time is only one component of four - dimensional space - time .",
    "but the concept of usual space and of usual time can be generalized .",
    "one can define ` space ' as that hypersphere in four - space on which one chooses the initial conditions .",
    "the remaining fourth coordinate can be understood as ` time ' .",
    "more formally , one conveniently introduces generalized coordinates @xmath5 . starting from a baseline parametrization of space - time like the instant form in figure  [ fig : bir2 ] , one parametrizes space - time by a coordinate transformation @xmath6 .",
    "the metric tensors for the two parametrizations are then related by @xmath7 the physical content of the theory can not depend on such a re - parametrization .",
    "but the raising and the lowering of lorentz indices are then non - trivial operations . as an example consider the front form parametrization in figure  [ fig : bir2 ] .",
    "interpret @xmath8 as the new space coordinate and denote it by @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath10 must be interpreted as the new time coordinate denoted by @xmath11 , or by the ` light - cone time ' @xmath12 .",
    "of course , one also could exchange the two . since the lowering operation is @xmath13 , both @xmath14 are space , and @xmath15 are time coordinates .",
    "the new space derivative is therefore @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is a time - derivative .",
    "the lorentz indices ` + ' and ` - ' have a different physical meaning , depending on whether they occur up- or down - stairs .",
    "co - variant and contra - variant vectors are different objects . the hamiltonian is only one component of a four - vector @xmath18 , particularly its time - like component .",
    "taking the partial time derivative of the state vector @xmath19 defines then @xmath20 as the hamiltonian in the transformed coordinates , in line with eq.([eq:1 ] ) , and @xmath21 as the longitudinal momentum .",
    "following dirac @xcite there are no more than three different parametrisations of space - time .",
    "they are illustrated in figure  [ fig : bir2 ] , and can not be mapped onto each other by a lorentz transform .",
    "they differ by the hypersphere on which the fields are initialized .",
    "they have thus different ` times ' and different ` hamiltonians ' .",
    "dirac @xcite speaks of the three _ forms of hamiltonian dynamics _ : the _ instant form _ is the familiar one , with its hypersphere given by @xmath22 . in the _ front form _",
    "the hypersphere is a tangent plane to the light cone . in the _ point form _",
    "the time - like coordinate is identified with the eigentime of a physical system and the hypersphere has a shape of a hyperboloid .",
    "which of the three forms should be prefered , is an ill - posed question , since all three forms must yield the same physical results .",
    "comparatively little work has been done in the point form .",
    "the bulk of research on field theory implicitly uses the instant form . although it is the conventional choice for quantizing field theory , it has many practical disadvantages .",
    "for example , given the wavefunctions of an @xmath23-electron atom at an initial time @xmath22 , @xmath24 , one can use the hamiltonian @xmath25 to evolve @xmath26 to later times @xmath27 .",
    "however , an experiment which specifies the initial wave function would require the simultaneous measurement of the positions of all of the bounded electrons .",
    "in contrast , determining the initial wave function at fixed light - cone time @xmath28 only requires an experiment which scatters one plane - wave laser beam , since the signal reaching each of the @xmath23 electrons , along the light front , at the same light - cone time @xmath29 .",
    "dirac s legacy had been forgotten and was re - invented several times .",
    "the front form approach carries therefore names as different as _ infinite - momentum frame _ , _ null - plane quantization _",
    ", _ light - cone quantization _ , or most recently _ light - front quantization_. in the essence they are all the same .",
    "the infinite - momentum frame is a misnomer since the total momentum is finite and since the front form is _ frame - independent _ and covariant .",
    "light - cone quantization is also unfortunate , since the inital data are set one a plane tangential to but not on the light cone , and since both equal - time or equal light - cone - time quantization stand both for the same quantization , for a quantum as opposed to a classical theory .",
    "we propose to stay with dirac s different ` forms of hamiltonians ' .",
    "the prototype of a field theory is faraday s and maxwell s electrodynamics .",
    "every field theory has its own canonical hamiltonian and is governed by the action density .",
    "the lagrangian is the subject of the canonical calculus of variation , given in many text books @xcite .",
    "its essentials shall be recalled briefly .",
    "the lagrangian , in general , is a function of a finite number of fields @xmath30 and their first space - time derivatives @xmath31 , thus @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "independent variation of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath35 results in the equations of motion , @xmath36 \\equiv { \\delta   { \\cal l } \\over \\delta      \\left(\\partial _",
    "\\kappa \\phi _",
    "r \\right ) }   , \\nonumber % \\label { eq:2.9}\\ ] ] canonically refered to as the euler equations .",
    "the canonical formalism is particularly suited for discussing the symmetries of a field theory .",
    "every continuous symmetry of the lagrangian is associated with a vanishing four - divergence of a current and a conserved charge . since @xmath33 does not explicitely depend on the coordinates , every field theory in 3 + 1 dimensions",
    "has ten conserved four - currents .",
    "the four - divergences of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath37 and of the boost - angular - momentum stress tensor @xmath38 vanish , @xmath39 as a consequence the lorentz group has ten ` conserved charges ' , the 4 components total momentum @xmath40 and the 6 components of boost - angular momentum @xmath41 , @xmath42 with the totally antisymmetric tensor in four dimensions @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , the three - dimensional surface elements of a hypersphere are @xmath45 .",

    "very often it is more convenient to think in terms of an analogue of a non - relativistic hamiltonian @xmath683 , @xmath684 whose eigenvalues @xmath685 are the more convential binding energies , while the eigenfunctions are the same . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the so defined ` schrdinger operator ' has much in common with a non - relativistic hamiltonian for the coulomb problem .",
    "all eigenvalues @xmath686 depend thus on the cut - off @xmath244 , the bare masses @xmath320 and the bare @xmath687 . in line with modern interpretation of quantum field theory @xcite , they are unphysical parameters and can be replaced by ( @xmath688 ) , by functions of @xmath244 , such that the eigenvalues are cut - off independent , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath689 this fundamental equation of the renormalization group must hold for all eigenvalues .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath690 depends on @xmath244 only through @xmath691 , @xmath692 and the regulator function @xmath693 .",
    "the renormalization group equations can be written therefore in the operator form @xmath694 the simultaneous variation of all three terms is a very difficult problem .",
    "but one can replace this equation by three independent ones , @xmath695 this is possible since one still solves eq.([ceq:9 ] ) .",
    "eqs.([ceq:10 ] ) and ( [ ceq:11 ] ) are two equations for the two unknown functions @xmath696 and @xmath697 .",
    "the first equation says that the effective flavor masses @xmath698 are renormalization group invariants .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath691 must be fixed by experiment .",
    " eq.([ceq:11 ] ) is then considered as an equation for @xmath697 at fixed values of @xmath691 .",
    "using the expression for @xmath676 given in eq.([aeq : m96 ] ) yields then @xcite @xmath699 with @xmath653 given in eq.([aeq : m96 ] ) .",
    "all @xmath244-dependence cancels exactly in favor of the renormalization group invariant @xmath652 , which is sometimes called the qcd - scale @xmath700 .",
    "the scale @xmath652 must be determind from experiment .",
    " once @xmath697 is known , eq.([ceq:10 ] ) is an equation for @xmath696 .",
    "this function can be determined from eq.([aeq : i64 ] ) , but we renounce to do that here , since @xmath696 is needed nowhere in the present context .  ",
    "having fixed the functions @xmath697 and @xmath696 one has exhausted all freedom provided by conventional renormalization anaysis of field theory @xcite .",
    "since the cutoff - dependence was removed by renormalization , the cut - off can be driven to infinity , thus @xmath701 formally , this solves eq.([ceq:12 ] ) .",
    "after renormalization , the kernel of the one - body equation is independent of @xmath244 .",
    "let us discuss its relevant part @xmath702 at very small momentum transfers @xmath703 , where @xmath704 and @xmath705 , the effective coupling constant locks into the finite value @xmath706 , see eq.([aeq : m96 ] ) .",
    "the spinor function also goes to a constant , @xmath707 , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the remaining ` coulomb singularity ' @xmath708 is square - integrable and can be dealt with by convenient numerical means @xcite . for very large momentum transfers @xmath709 ,",
    "the behaviour is quite different .",
    "both @xmath710 and @xmath711 tend to diverge , @xmath712 and @xmath713 , but such that the ratio @xmath714 tends to a _ finite constant_. disregarding the very slow logarythmic increase of @xmath653 , the kernel of the integral equation is therefore essentially a dimensionless constant @xmath715 one has sufficient evidence @xcite that this behaviour creates all kinds of problems , among them a diverging eigenvalue .    one can separate the kernel of the integral equation identically into two pieces @xmath716 , _ i.e. _ @xmath717 with an arbitrary mass parameter @xmath718 . the first part @xmath719 is well behaved and vanishes at least like @xmath720 in the limit of large @xmath471 .",
    "the second part @xmath721 is a strange object : it is a constant almost everywhere , in particular @xmath722 one should emphasize the following aspect . the typical field theoretical divergences like the divergence of the effective coupling constant lead to a _ divergence _ of the kernel , but adding a _ finite constant _ to the kernel leads also to a divergence .",

    "since @xmath721 involves a renormalization and since the singlet can have an energy shift ( @xmath760 ) different from the triplet ( @xmath761 ) , one has at most two additional renormalization constants , subject to be determined by experiment .",

    "the resulting quark masses are given in table  [ tab : quarks ] .    actually , there is no reason why one should stick to eq.([peq:103 ] ) .",
