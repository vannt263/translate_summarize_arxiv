    "modern cosmology revolves around the dark energy problem - the fact that the standard model of cosmology presumes that the present day energy density of the universe is dominated by a substance known as dark energy of which the physical origin is entirely unknown .",
    "a large number of theories have been proposed as the physical foundation for dark energy and several of the resulting cosmological models are not falsifiable by current observations .",
    "constraining and eventually excluding physical models of dark energy with future observations is a top priority goal in cosmology .",
    "different physical models of dark energy generally lead to different overall dynamics of the universe .",
    "hence , observables that yield information about the expansion history of the universe , described by the hubble parameter @xmath0 , are important for reaching this goal .",
    "one such observable is the redshift drift @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity describes the minute temporal changes in the redshift of a comoving luminous source that take place because of acceleration or deceleration of the universe s expansion .",
    "the fact that such a drift in the redshift should in principle occur in any non - coasting universe was first realized in the 1960 s @xcite .",
    "it was initially deemed futile to measure the redshift drift since it would require time intervals of the order @xmath2 years with the technology available at that time .",
    "it was later @xcite proposed that more modern technology might allow redshift drift measurements by using _",
    "e.g. _ the lyman @xmath3 forest at high redshifts ( @xmath4 ) as observable . elaborating on this suggestion , it is today estimated that the next generation of extremely large telescopes ( elts ) can be used to measure the redshift drift of absorption lines of qso spectra in the redshift range @xmath5 using time intervals of the order @xmath6 years @xcite .",
    "thus , measuring the redshift drift has become a practicable possibility .",
    "the redshift drift in flrw models is given by the expression : @xmath7 \\delta t_0\\ ] ] subscripts @xmath8 denote time of observation ( present time ) while the subscript @xmath9 denotes evaluation at the time of emission .",
    "@xmath10 is the time interval between two measurements of the redshift of a given source .",
    "the formula shows that if the hubble constant is known , _",
    "e.g. _ through low - redshift supernova observations , then measurements of the redshift drift directly yield @xmath0 for any cosmological model with an flrw metric .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is highly dependent on the expansion history of the universe and it is the hope that future measurements of @xmath1 over large redshift intervals will put significant constraints on the expansion history of the universe and hence on possible solutions to the dark energy problem .",
    "it has , for instance , over the last couple of decades become clear that a large local void with us near its center can lead to redshift - distance relations equal to those predicted by the standard model but without introducing dark energy ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that such models generally have redshift drifts that deviate significantly from that of the standard model @xcite .",
    "one difference which has gotten particularly much attention is that the redshift drift is negative in ltb void models for all redshifts @xcite while it is positive at small redshifts in the standard model .",
    "redshift drift measurements should thus make it possible to exclude either the standard model or the cosmological models based on ltb models with us at the center of a large void mimicking accelerated expansion .",
    "it should be noted that a large local void does not exclude a positive redshift drift at low redshifts ; if the given model includes a dark energy component , the redshift drift may be positive at low redshifts regardless of the existence of a local void .",
    "the possible existence of such a local void is important _",
    "e.g. _ for dark energy phenomenology and parameter inferences based on standard observables @xcite . aside from in local void models ,",
    "redshift drift has been studied in _",
    "e.g. _ stephani models @xcite , bianchi models @xcite , models of holographic dark energy @xcite , @xmath11 models @xcite , models with a varying value of @xmath12 @xcite , timescape models @xcite , and a variety of different types of dark energy models and models of modified gravity @xcite .",
    "the studies show that different models will generally lead to different predictions of @xmath1 , even in cases where _",
    "e.g. _ redshift - distance relations are similar .",
    "there is currently much focus on how inhomogeneities can affect observations and their interpretation .",
    "one particularly intriguing effect of inhomogeneities is cosmic backreaction which is a consequence of the noncommutativity of temporal development and spatial averaging in general relativity ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for introductions and reviews to cosmic backreaction ) .",
    "this effect leads the average evolution of inhomogeneous spacetimes to generally deviate from that of an flrw spacetime even if the inhomogeneous spacetime has a homogeneity scale .",
    "cosmic backreaction can lead to on - average accelerated expansion of the universe even though the local expansion is decelerating everywhere ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for explicit examples and _ e.g. _ @xcite for general considerations ) .",
    "this has led to the backreaction conjecture which proposes that the seeming need for dark energy is simply the result of neglecting cosmic backreaction when interpreting observations through flrw predictions .",
    "cosmic backreaction can in principle mimic a cosmological constant @xcite , although studies indicate that this is unlikely at least within the restricted setting of perturbation theory @xcite . in general",
    ", the backreaction conjecture is expected to lead to a different expansion history than that predicted by the standard model . as a result ,",
    "redshift drift measurements in agreement with standard model predictions could be considered basis for rejecting the backreaction conjecture from the pool of viable physical explanations of dark energy .",
    "the purpose of this work is to assess the validity of such a statement . in order to do this , an expression for the average redshift drift in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic dust cosmology",
    "is derived .",
    "the resulting expression is valid even in the case of significant backreaction . by using two - region models ( see section [ sec:2region ] ) , the expression is used to study the possibility of obtaining average redshift drifts in models without dark energy , that are observationally indistinguishable from the redshift drift of the standard model .",
    "in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the expression for the redshift in a ( spatially ) statistically homogeneous and isotropic dust universe was derived . that derivation is the basis for obtaining an expression for the redshift drift in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic dust universe .",
    "it will thus be summarized below , functioning as a means of introducing the physical setup and notational conventions .",
    "it is assumed that the dust is irrotational , implying that the spacetime can be foliated with spatial hypersurfaces orthogonal to the velocity field of the dust @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the dust is comoving and the metric can be assumed to take a form corresponding to the line element : @xmath13 the components of the spatial metric @xmath14 are arbitrary except that the metric is assumed to describe a statistically homogeneous and isotropic space .",
    "the velocity field of an observer comoving with the dust is denoted by @xmath15 and can be split into an expansion part , a shear part and a vorticity part as given by the equation ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite or chapter 9 of @xcite ) : @xmath16 a subscripted semicolon denotes covariant differentiation .",
    "the tensor @xmath17 is the projection tensor projecting onto the 3-space orthogonal to @xmath15 . in the case of irrotational dust ,",
    "the vorticity vanishes and so @xmath18 is assumed to be zero in the following .",
    "it is then the expansion scalar @xmath19 and the traceless shear tensor is used . ]",
    "@xmath20 which will be important . using the setup introduced above , an analysis in @xcite shows that the redshift in a dust spacetime can be written as an integral along the given null - geodesic as follows : @xmath21 \\right)\\ ] ] @xmath22 is a unit vector field orthogonal to @xmath15 and gives the propagation direction of the light ray as seen by an observer moving with velocity @xmath15 , _ i.e. _ @xmath23 .",
    "this expression is in @xcite related to average quantities , where the average is defined following the buchert averaging scheme ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . using this scheme ,",
    "the spatial average of a scalar field @xmath24 over a comoving spatial domain @xmath25 is defined as : @xmath26 the spatial volume element is given by @xmath27 . using this definition of scalar averages ,",
    "a scale factor can be introduced as @xmath28 .",
    "the expression for the redshift given in equation ( [ eq : redshift ] ) is in @xcite related to the average redshift by arguments that will only be summarized here .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further details . in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe , there is no preferred direction and so the projection of the shear along @xmath22 should be small when integrated over distances that are long compared to the homogeneity scale .",
    "the integral will only vanish identically in an exactly homogeneous and isotropic universe , but in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe the term @xmath29 will lead to a subdominant contribution in the integral above , compared to the term @xmath30 .",
    "the expansion scalar can be split into an average part and a fluctuation field @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath31 is not necessarily small compared to @xmath33 , but if structures evolve slowly compared to the time it takes light to travel the distance of the homogeneity scale , then the contribution of @xmath31 to the integral above should be much smaller than that of @xmath33 ; if structures are approximately static during the time it takes a light ray to travel a distance corresponding to the homogeneity scale , then the redshift gained after traveling such a distance should be the same for all geodesics ( up to statistical fluctuations ) .",
    "thus , @xmath31 should only lead to statistical fluctuations of measured redshifts .",
    "a rough estimate of the contribution of @xmath31 to the above integral is given in @xcite with the result that the contribution can be expected to be of the order @xmath34 .",
    "one point of concern with the above discussion is that it is tacitly assumed that light rays  sample \" space  fairly \" when they propagate through spacetime , _",
    "i.e. _ it is assumed that light rays do not consistently avoid or prefer a specific type of region such as voids or large overdensities .",
    "if this assumption is incorrect , the integral of @xmath35 along a null - ray will be equal to a non - zero off - set , instead of being equal to zero , up to statistical fluctuations .",
    "this will again lead the actual average observed redshift to deviate from the expression in equation [ eq : z_av ] below .",
    "it was for instance found in @xcite that if voids have a narrow shape and are highly anisotropic , light rays will consistently avoid the central part of the voids .",
    "however , a study of averaging over several light rays in swiss cheese models based on more realistic void profiles indicates that light rays on average will sample space fairly @xcite .",
    "an unfair sampling of space could also be expected to occur because baryonic matter bound in high - density structures is impermeable to light and so any light ray that reaches such highly dense region will never reach us .",
    "since most matter is dark , it seems likely that this should not lead to a significant bias of the average observed redshift .",
    "overall , it seems reasonable to assume that observed light rays will sample space fairly , although a more thorough study of this may be appropriate . from the above discussion , it follows that the redshift will approximately be equal to its average and can be written as : @xmath36 the average redshift can be understood as the average redshift of light emitted from a given spatial hypersurface and observed at @xmath37 by an observer comoving with the dust .",
    "it follows straightforward from the buchert averaging scheme that @xmath38 , where subscripted commas followed by one or more coordinates indicate partial differentiation with respect to the indicated coordinate(s ) .",
    "thus , the above expression reduces to : @xmath39 an example of the difference between the average redshift and the exact redshift along individual rays can be seen in figure 9 of @xcite where swiss - cheese models based on ltb models with significant backreaction are studied .",
    "the redshift drift measured in a time interval @xmath10 is to first order given by @xmath40 . according to the previous discussion",
    "this can be written as : @xmath41 \\right ) - \\exp\\left ( \\int_{t_e}^{t_0}dt \\left [ \\frac{1}{3}\\theta + \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}e^{\\mu}e^{\\nu}\\right ] \\right ) \\\\   \\approx \\exp\\left ( \\int_{t_e + \\delta t_e}^{t_0 + \\delta t_0}dt \\frac{1}{3}\\left\\langle \\theta\\right\\rangle   \\right ) - \\exp\\left ( \\int_{t_e}^{t_0}dt\\frac{1}{3}\\left\\langle \\theta\\right\\rangle \\right ) = \\frac{\\left\\langle a(t_0 + \\delta t_0)\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle a(t_e + \\delta t_e)\\right\\rangle } - \\frac{\\left\\langle a(t_0)\\right\\rangle }",
    "{ \\left\\langle a(t_e)\\right\\rangle } \\end{split}\\ ] ] aside from the brackets indicating spatial averaging , this expression is identical to the expression for the redshift drift in flrw models .",
    "it can be written in a more convenient form by using the taylor expansion @xmath42 . inserting this into the above equation yields : @xmath43 the hubble parameter has here been defined by @xmath44 .",
    "the last step is to obtain a relation between @xmath45 and @xmath10 .",
    "since there are no peculiar velocities with the assumed foliation of spacetime , @xmath46 follows directly from the geometric optics approximation ( see _ e.g. _ chapters 7 and 15 of @xcite or section 3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "as illustrated by the equality @xmath46 , @xmath45 is a quantity that in principle needs to be averaged .",
    "however , @xmath47 implies that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the time interval corresponding to @xmath10 averaged over the spatial hypersurface at @xmath50 .",
    "the above considerations show that the expression for the redshift drift can be written as : @xmath51 \\delta t_0\\ ] ] aside from the indicated approximation and the brackets indicating spatial averaging , this is exactly the same expression as for flrw spacetimes .",
    "the expression is also the same as that obtained for timescape backreaction models @xcite , where the result is obtained by introducing a local , average metric based ondressed \" parameters ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for an introduction to the concept of dressed parameters ) .",
    "the expression for the average redshift drift given in equation ( [ eq : drift_av ] ) is in principle also stated in @xcite . in relation to that statement",
    ", concern is expressed regarding the potential importance of fluctuations around @xmath52 due to the small size of @xmath1 itself .",
    "this point is discussed in subsection [ sec : caveats ] , where the justification of equation ( [ eq : drift_av ] ) is studied more closely .",
    "the expression in equation ( [ eq : drift_av ] ) is valid not only for dust models , but also models containing one or more dark energy components with vanishing sound speed ; such components will not have pressure gradients and will thus follow a geodesic flow .",
    "if the individual components are comoving initially , they will stay comoving and so the comoving , synchronous foliation of spacetime with space orthogonal to the flow lines is permitted . before moving on , it should be noted that an expression for the average redshift drift has earlier been derived using light - cone averages ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the spatially averaged redshift drift is related to observables ; the redshift drift of a luminous object deviates from the spatially averaged redshift drift only by statistical fluctuations .",
    "although the light - cone approach certainly has its merits , it does thus not seem to be immediately necessary to introduce light - cone averaging for redshift drift considerations .",
    "equation ( [ eq : drift_av ] ) gives an expression for the average redshift drift measured by an observer comoving with the dust in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe . in that equation",
    ", it is also implied that deviations between the average redshift drift and the exact redshift drift of a given luminous object are small .",
    "that assessment is considered more carefully in this subsection .",
    "the exact redshift drift can be written as : @xmath53 the factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 depend on the particular source and observer and are given by : @xmath56 \\right ) \\\\ x_{s2 } : = \\exp\\left ( \\int_{t_e}^{t_0}dt \\left [ \\frac{1}{3}\\delta \\theta + \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}e^{\\mu}e^{\\nu}\\right ] \\right ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] according to the arguments given in @xcite and summarized in the previous subsection , each of these two factors are approximately equal to one .",
    "in addition , the two factors are approximately equal under the assumption that @xmath10 and @xmath45 are small compared to both the scale of cosmic structure formation and compared to the time interval @xmath57 .",
    "these two assumptions are already inherent for discussing the redshift drift in the range @xmath58 , and stating that @xmath59 is similar to noting that the redshift drift is a small quantity ( typically of order @xmath60 on a time scale of @xmath61 10 years for a source at @xmath62 ) .",
    "the former part of the assumption ensures that the light emitted from a given source and observed at the two different epochs has traveled along only negligibly different spacetime paths .",
    "the assumption then ensures that the functions under the two integrals can be considered the same even though they are in principle traced along two different null - geodesics .",
    "the latter assumption is necessary for the obvious numerical reason that two integrals over the same integrand are only equal if the integration limits are the same ( or if the integrand vanishes or is self - canceling where the integration limits differ which is also possible in the considered physical setup ) . since @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the approximation @xmath65 should be fairly safe , especially considering that real observations will presumably be made with several sources at similar redshifts such that an average can be made to reduce errors due to statistical fluctuations . the question of whether deviations from the average value are important for redshift drift observations has also been considered elsewhere with the focus mainly being on peculiar motion .",
    "peculiar motion was neglected above since the spacetime foliation was chosen to be comoving . in the real universe",
    ", peculiar motion may be an important source of contamination of redshift drift measurements .",
    "this possibility has been studied elsewhere with the conclusions generally being that peculiar velocities will have negligible effect on redshift drift observations while peculiar acceleration might have a significant effect which should however vanish upon averaging over several objects @xcite ( see _ e.g. _ also @xcite ) . in appendix",
    "[ app : cheese_and_voids ] , the exact redshift drift is computed in swiss - cheese models containing dust and dark energy .",
    "these computations are in accordance with the assumption that fluctuations of the redshift drift about the average value are small .",
    "the local environment of the observer may bias observations and this is not taken into account in the expression given in equation ( [ eq : drift_av ] ) .",
    "however , it is illustrated in appendix [ app : cheese_and_voids ] that very large and deep voids are needed in order to compromise redshift drift measurements .",
    "effects of a local overdensity has not been studied as such are expected to be of the same size as those caused by a local underdensity .",
    "two - region models @xcite ( se also _",
    "@xcite ) are simple toy - models that can be used to illustrate consequences of non - vanishing cosmic backreaction .",
    "two - region models consist of two non - interacting regions that each behave according to the friedmann equations , but where the flrw parameters are different in the two regions .",
    "the average scale factor of a two - region model is given by @xmath66 , where subscripts @xmath67 indicate the two separate regions .",
    "since the two individual regions are non - interacting , the average hubble parameter is simply given by : @xmath68 the two - region models studied here are based on the two - region model considered in _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . in this type of two - region models ,",
    "the underdense region is completely empty while the overdense region is a closed matter - only flrw model .",
    "in such a model , cosmic time and the scale factors can be related to the development angle @xmath69 of the overdense region as follows : @xmath70 the models studied here are defined by setting @xmath71 and by requiring that the average hubble constant takes the value @xmath72km / s / mpc . @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the volume fractions of the over- and underdense regions at @xmath75 . the parameter @xmath73 is varied in order to obtain two - region models with different expansion histories .",
    "two - region models can be related to statistically homogeneous and isotropic universes as follows .",
    "the spatial hypersurfaces of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe can be divided into areas that are overdense and areas that are underdense compared to some threshold value .",
    "the two - region models can be considered the simplest attempt to include effects of inhomogeneities by splitting the spacetime into one part describing the total underdense portion of the spacetime and one part describing the entire overdense portion .",
    "both regions are approximated as being described by an flrw model . in the particular two - region models used here ,",
    "the underdense region is for simplicity modeled as empty , but it could instead have been modeled _",
    "e.g. _ as an open matter - only flrw region ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for an example of such a model ) . when viewed in this manner ,",
    "the two - region models can be considered a simple subclass of the multiscale models introduced in @xcite ( see _ e.g. _ also @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic backreaction is an effect that occurs because of spatial averaging .",
    "clearly , much of this averaging is neglected in the two - region models if they are to be considered as just described .",

    "redshift drift leads to a spectral velocity shift @xmath77 .",
    "the accuracy of a @xmath78 measurement of high - redshift qso spectra with the next generation of elts was investigated in @xcite , leading to the following expression for the expected measurement uncertainties : @xmath79 @xmath80 is the signal - to - noise ratio per @xmath81 pixel , @xmath82 is the number of targets at a given redshift @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for @xmath85 while @xmath86 otherwise .",
    "the factor @xmath3 is equal to 2 if only @xmath87 absorption lines are considered , and reduces to @xmath88 if all available absorption lines are included .",

    "models with redshift drifts falling inside the error bars would be observationally indistinguishable from this @xmath76cdm model as far as redshift drift measurements are concerned . in other words , models with their redshift drift falling inside the error bars would be mistaken for the @xmath76cdm model when redshift drift observations are interpreted using flrw cosmology .",
    "the difference between the velocity shift of a @xmath76cdm model and a variety of ( similar ) two - region models is shown in figure [ fig:2region ] .",

    "note that it is possible to construct two - region models with a redshift drift that is observationally indistinguishable from that of the @xmath76cdm model even for @xmath104 years .",
    "the caveat is that this requires abandoning the restriction that the average hubble parameter has a present time value equal to the hubble constant of the @xmath76cdm model used in the comparisons ( @xmath10570km / s / mpc ) .",
    "such models will generally have a redshift - distance relation that deviates significantly from that of the @xmath76cdm model .",
    "lastly it is noted that , as shown in figure [ fig:2region_zdrift ] , the redshift drift of all the studied two - region models is positive at low redshifts .",
    "this illustrates the fact that observing a positive redshift drift at low redshifts is _ not _ a cause to reject any cosmological model that does not include a locally accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "one caveat with this statement is the issue of the relevance of averaging at low redshifts which corresponds to averaging over small volumes . as discussed in the next section ,",

    "an expression for the average redshift drift in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe was derived .",

    "it was possible to construct simple two - region models that lead to a velocity shift indistinguishable from that of the @xmath76cdm model in cases with @xmath108 years . for longer @xmath10 ,",
    "the differences between the predictions of the two - region models and the @xmath76cdm model become larger than the expected uncertainty in velocity shift measurements with the next generation of extremely large telescopes .",

[ [ spherically - symmetric - models - with - inhomogeneous - dust - and - dark - energy ] ] spherically symmetric models with inhomogeneous dust and dark energy ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the exact solution to einstein s field equations for spherically symmetric cosmological models containing @xmath109 decoupled , non - comoving perfect fluids was presented by valerio marra and mikko paakkonen in @xcite .",
    "a special limit of these are the spherically symmetric models with an inhomogeneous dust ( dark matter ) component and an inhomogeneous dark energy component .",
    "these models can be simplified by restricting the dark energy sound speed be zero such that the dust and dark energy is comoving ( assuming that they start out comoving ) .",
    "such simplified models are the ones that will be considered in the following , and will for notational simplicity be referred to as the `` mp '' models .",
    "below , a summary of the dynamics of mp models is given , followed by a specification of the particular models used here .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for details .",
    "the line element of the mp models can be written exactly as the line element of the ltb models _",
    "i.e. _ : @xmath110 the dynamical equations can be written as : @xmath111 the topmost equation is a rewriting of the equation defining @xmath112",
    ". the main difference between the above set of equations and the equivalent equations for ltb models is that @xmath113 has a time dependence due to the pressure of the dark energy component .",
    "the above four equations make up a set of coupled odes that can be solved simultaneously .",
    "the initial conditions which have been used here will be described below .",
    "there is no need for a differential equation for the dark matter component s density field as this can be obtained simply as @xmath114 .",
    "the mp models will be used to construct single void models that reduce to flrw models either outside some specific boundary value @xmath115 of the radial coordinate , or asymptotically .",
    "this flrw model will be referred to as the background of the model .",
    "the dark energy component has an equation of state parameter @xmath116 and will be sub - dominant to the dark matter component at early times .",
    "hence , at early times , the dark energy component can be ignored and the model reduces to a regular ltb model . by setting the initial conditions at early times ,",
    "these can thus be set by approximating the mp model as an ltb model .",
    "there are then two free functions and an extra degree of freedom due to the coordinate covariance of the radial coordinate .",
    "in addition , an equation of state parameter for the dark energy component must be specified .",
    "the initial conditions will be set at the background time of last scattering ( _ i.e. _ at @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the scale factor of the background model ) .",
    "the coordinate covariance is removed by setting @xmath119 . the big bang time is set equal to zero . under this requirement",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that the curvature function @xmath120 can be related to the density perturbation by the approximate relation @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the hubble parameter of the background model . in this equation",
    ", the perturbation in the density field is given through @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the dark energy density perturbation is set according to @xmath125 . since the dark energy sound speed is set equal to zero",
    ", the dark energy pressure is homogeneous , @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the pressure of the dark energy component in the background ( see @xcite regarding details of the dark energy component s equation of state parameter ) .",
    "the final specification of the initial conditions is made by choosing the functional form of @xmath120 and by specifying background functions including @xmath128 .",
    "the functions studied here have @xmath120 given by one of the two following functional forms : @xmath129 @xmath130 the parameters @xmath131 are varied . in all the models , @xmath132 is of the order @xmath133 , @xmath115 and @xmath134 are always of the same order as each other , and @xmath135 .      a set of odes that can be used to obtain the redshift drift along radial rays in ltb models was given in _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and the results were later generalized to axially symmetric szekeres models and szekeres models with no symmetries @xcite . here ,",
    "the odes presented in @xcite are sufficient and will be listed below .",
    "radial null - geodesics can be described by the two odes : @xmath136 note that the sign conventions are here chosen to fit a situation with @xmath137 , but the sign conventions in the odes may be changed to suit the reverse situation .",
    "this is needed _",
    "e.g. _ when working with swiss - cheese models , where it can be convenient to introduce a  global \" radial coordinate .",
    "the redshift drift is defined as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is a small time interval corresponding to the small observer - based time interval @xmath10 .",
    "inserting this into the two equations above and introducing a taylor expansion leads to the following further odes when only first order terms in @xmath1 and @xmath139 are kept : @xmath140 these four odes can be solved simultaneously to obtain the redshift drift as a function of the redshift along radial rays in mp models . in @xcite ,",
    "the differential equations are transformed into equations where the differentiations are with respect to the redshift .",
    "this is done under the restriction of only considering models where the redshift is monotonic along the null - geodesics .",
    "this requirement is generally not fulfilled and in particular , some of the models studied here do not fulfill it .",
    "the set of odes is thus kept as above , where the differentiation is with respect to the radial coordinate .",
    "note that an analytic expression for the redshift drift as seen by a central observer in an ltb universe was derived in @xcite ( and given in equation 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "the definition of the redshift drift in @xcite appears to be slightly different than the definition used here , although the two definitions agree in the flrw limit .",
    "the latter is explicitly demonstrated in @xcite while the former _ e.g. _ can be seen numerically by comparing the redshift drift defined in @xcite to the redshift drift computed with equation ( [ eq : zdrift_ltb ] ) , or by comparing the differential equation in ( [ eq : zdrift_ltb ] ) with the equivalent equation obtained by differentiating the redshift drift corresponding to equation 9 in @xcite .",
    "at least for the models studied here , the difference between the two redshift drifts is small and does not lead to qualitative differences in the study described in this appendix . upon averaging over the entire double - structure of the void - wall models used here , the average evolution reduces to that of the background of the particular model .",
    "thus , the models considered in the following have vanishing backreaction and the average redshift drift in the models is simply the redshift drift of the background models .",
    "the expression for the ( average ) redshift drift given in equation ( [ eq : drift_av ] ) does not take possible effects of the local environment into account . by computing the redshift drift in different void models , it is here studied how large a local void is likely to need to be in order for it to bias redshift drift observations at an observationally significant level .",
    "all the results shown below were obtained by setting @xmath91 years .",
    "figure [ fig : ltbvoids ] shows the velocity shift in different void models with an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) background defined by @xmath95km / s / mpc .",
    "figure [ fig : lltbvoids ] shows the same for models with a @xmath76cdm background defined by @xmath141 = 70km / s / mpc , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the figures indicate that voids must be very deep and large ( @xmath144gpc radius ) in order for them to affect observations .",
    "note also that the voids must be significantly larger and deeper when the background is a @xmath76cdm background .",
    "this is expected since the cosmological constant comprises the larger part of the present time energy density and is homogeneous .",
    "the total overdensity @xmath145 is thus significantly smaller than the matter overdensity @xmath146 in models with the @xmath76cdm model as their background . as will be shown in the next subsection",
    ", the density fluctuations of dark energy components generally remain small compared to the dark matter density fluctuations of the same model . changing @xmath147",
    "slightly from -1 will therefore not change the result that in models dominated by dark energy , the dark matter perturbations must be larger and deeper than in pure dark matter models , in order for the density fluctuations to have significant impact on redshift drift observations . aside from the backgrounds used in the two figures being different ,",
    "the void profiles have also been modeled differently ; the models with the ltb backgrounds have been modeled using @xmath120 as in equation ( [ eq : k_comp ] ) while the models with the @xmath76cdm background have been modeled with @xmath120 as given in equation ( [ eq : k_uncomp ] ) .",
    "the void profile does not seem to be particularly important for the redshift drift .",
    "this is illustrated in the top row of figure [ fig : compare ] .",
    "the figure shows that the void profile is mildly important for the effects on the velocity shift , but the overall effect of voids on the redshift drift / velocity shift does not seem to depend much on the particular density profile ( consistent with remarks made in @xcite ) .",
    "instead , the important void characteristics are the void depth and radial extent .",
    "the results obtained above are based on studying particular inhomogeneous solutions to einstein s equations .",
    "other void models may in principle lead to different results .",
    "it does , however , seem reasonable to expect that the results obtained here will be valid in general at a qualitative level .",
    "_ i.e. _ it will presumably generally be the case that large voids are needed in order for local voids to affect redshift drift measurements at a significant level . even in this case",
    ", the results here do not guarantee that large voids will be detectable with redshift drift measurements and that small voids will not affect observations .",
    "the former is illustrated in the bottom row of figure [ fig : compare ] which shows the shift in the velocity shift compared to the background ( @xmath76cdm ) model .",
    "the velocity shift is shown for two models .",
    "the model with the larger , deeper void has a velocity shift deviating from that of the background model s at a level that is below the expected accuracy of the next generation elt measurements .",
    "the velocity shift of the model with the smaller void deviates more .",
    "the effects of local overdensities have not been studied here but it is expected that the results will be qualitatively the same : large , high overdensities are needed in order for the redshift drift to be affected at a level important for observations . see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a study that includes effects of large local overdensities .",
    "lastly that the primary reason that voids need to be extremely large in order to affect observations is that elt observations of the redshift drift are expected to be made only at large redshifts .",
    "depending on the size of the uncertainty of low - redshift measurements , such measurements of the redshift drift may be affected by much smaller voids .",
    "even disregarding large local structures , the redshift drift of a given object will not be exactly equal to the average redshift drift except in models that are exactly spatially homogeneous and isotropic . as discussed in section [ sec : caveats ] , statistical fluctuations about the average value are expected to be small and negligible as long as observational results are averaged over a reasonable number of observed objects . as an illustration of the size that the fluctuations in the redshift drift can be expected to have , the redshift drift has been computed in four different swiss - cheese models .",
    "the models are constructed by combining single void models based on @xmath120 given in equation ( [ eq : k_comp ] ) .",
    "the four models are based on four different backgrounds : an eds model , a @xmath76cdm model and two @xmath148cdm models with @xmath149 .",
    "the redshift drift has , in each model , been computed along a single ray that propagates radially through consecutive voids with present time radii of approximately 60mpc .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : cheese ] .",
    "the fluctuations in the redshift drift compared to the background ( and hence average ) redshift drift are barely visible .",
    "the figure also shows the corresponding shift in the velocity shift compared to the background velocity shift .",
    "as seen , the fluctuations in the velocity shift are well below the accuracy expected from the next generation elt observations .",
    "the results are based on @xmath91 years .",
    "the density along the four rays is shown in figure [ fig : cheese_rho ] .",
    "the dark matter densities along the four rays are not particularly distinguishable from each other and the point with the figure is merely to illustrate the order of the size of the density fluctuations .",
    "the dark energy fluctuations are clearly distinguishable from each other since @xmath150 leads to fluctuations of the opposite sign of the dark matter fluctuations .",
    "note that the density fluctuations of the dark energy components are much smaller than the perturbations in the dark matter density fields ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for an elaboration of this point ) .",
    "the redshift drift and velocity shift fluctuations shown in figure [ fig : cheese ] are due to inhomogeneities in the density and thus the geometry of spacetime , and not actually peculiar velocities . as shown in _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , inhomogeneities in spacetime can be interpreted in terms of peculiar velocities .",
    "the study conducted here can therefore equally be considered as illustrating effects of peculiar velocity fields as showing effects of an inhomogeneous geometry .",
    "however , studies based on _",
    "e.g. _ perturbation theory indicate that peculiar acceleration is more important than effects of peculiar velocity .",
    "since no actual peculiar velocity or acceleration fields have been computed here , the results presented above should be considered with caution . in addition , the results shown here are for specific swiss - cheese models",
    ". the fluctuations in the velocity shift may be significantly larger in other models .",
    "for example , the voids in the swiss - cheese models are only somewhat deep . by using equation ( [ eq : k_uncomp ] ) , other swiss - cheese models with deeper voids",
    "have been constructed .",
    "these models fluctuations in @xmath78 are also well below the expected elt accuracy , in agreement with the results shown in figure [ fig : cheese ] .    99 allan sandage , _ the change of redshift and apparent luminosity of galaxies due to the deceleration of selected expanding universes _ , astrophysical journal , vol .",
