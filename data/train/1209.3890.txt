    "it is generally believed that the stars in a globular cluster ( gc ) are born almost at the same time and have similar metal abundances , even though there are some gcs with multiple stellar populations in the milky way ( mw ) @xcite .",
    "gcs are often assumed as single stellar population ( ssp ) systems and their observed quantities can be compared with theoretical models for the estimation of their physical parameters .",
    "they also contain information on the formation and evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "therefore , analysis of their ages and metallicities can provide critical clues for understanding the evolution of their host galaxies .    according to the current models of structure formation ,",
    "giant elliptical galaxies ( ges ) are considered to form and evolve through mergers with various galaxies .",
    "they might have accreted thousands of gcs and sometimes formed new star clusters during the merging process @xcite .",
    "therefore , investigation of ages and metallicities of the gcs in ges may allow us to understand how gcs and their host galaxies formed and evolved .",
    "though , in the case of ges , it is not possible to obtain detailed information on the resolved stars in gcs with current telescopes , we can effectively estimate their age and metallicity using integrated spectroscopy .",
    "there are several studies on the ages and metallicities of gcs in nearby ges based on integrated spectroscopy , which are summarized briefly below for six ges ( ngc 5128 , m87 , m49 , m60 , ngc 1407 , ngc 1399 )",
    ". basic properties of these galaxies are given in table 3 of @xcite .",
    "the gcs of the nearest ge ngc 5128 were extensively studied thanks to its relatively short distance , 3.8 mpc @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite derived the metallicities , ages and [ @xmath0/fe ]  values for 72 gcs in ngc 5128 using the lick indices obtained with the gemini / gmos .",
    "ninety - two percent of the metal - poor gcs ( mp gcs ) have ages older than 8 gyr , while 56 percent of the metal - rich gcs ( mr gcs ) do so .",
    "they found that the metallicity distribution of the ngc 5128 gcs is bimodal if seen through the metallicities derived directly from the spectroscopic lick indices ( [ mgfe]@xmath7 ) , but the distribution is not well constrained if they use lick indices and ssp models . from these results together with the [ @xmath0/fe ] data , they suggested that most gcs in ngc 5128 formed rapidly at early times , while some gcs formed later with subsequent major accretion .",
    "the gcs of m87 ( ngc 4486 ) , a cd galaxy located at the center of the virgo cluster , were studied spectroscopically early by @xcite .",
    "they reported that the mean metallicity of the gcs is higher than that of the mw gcs , and that the metallicity distribution shows a bimodal feature with peaks at [ fe / h ] = 1.3 and 0.7 .",
    "the metallicities of the m87 gcs show a small radial gradient with a large scatter , but the ages of the gcs show no radial gradient .",
    "they suggested that the median age of the m87 gcs is 13 gyr , similar to that of the mw gcs .",
    "m49 ( ngc 4472 ) is the brightest ge in the virgo cluster .",
    "@xcite presented the spectroscopic results of 47 gcs in this galaxy obtained with the keck telescope .",
    "they concluded that the m49 gcs have slightly higher metallicities than the m87 gcs , while other metallicity and age parameters are basically similar to those of the m87 gcs .",
    "they estimated that the mean age of these gcs is about 10 gyr .",
    "@xcite reported a study of 38 gcs in m60 ( ngc 4649 ) in the virgo cluster .",
    "they found that several young ( 2  3 gyr old ) gcs in this galaxy have supersolar metallicities , while the majority of the gcs have a wide range of metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = 2.0 to 0.0 ) , and are older than 10 gyr .",
    "they also found that the alpha - element ratios of the m60 gcs decrease with increasing metallicity .",
    "the gcs in ngc 1407 , the brightest galaxy in the ngc 1407 subgroup of the eridanus group , were studied recently by @xcite .",
    "they found that 20 gcs are mostly old , while three gcs could be young ( @xmath8 gyr ) .",
    "the metallicity of the gcs reaches up to slightly above solar and the mean [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratio is @xmath9 dex , similar to that of the mw gcs .",
    "spectroscopic properties of the gcs in ngc 1399 , ge in the center of the fornax cluster , were studied early by @xcite and @xcite . from the keck spectra of 10 gcs",
    ", @xcite showed that at least some of the gcs have supersolar metal abundances .",
    "two gcs with significantly higher h@xmath10  values and enhanced abundance ratios could be regarded as young ( @xmath11 gyr ) or extremely old ( @xmath12 gyr ) ages with a warm blue horizontal branch . from this",
    "they proposed a possibility of a complicated age distribution among the mr gcs and of some constraints on their chemical enrichment at later epochs .",
    "these previous studies have some limitations .",
    "the number of the studied galaxies in this regard is only six , and the number of gcs in each galaxy is still small .",
    "the areal coverage for some galaxies is not wide enough , either .",
    "therefore , it is needed to obtain new spectroscopic data for more gcs in each galaxy and for more ges in order to better understand the chemical properties of ge gcs .",

    "ngc 4636 , located at the southeast boundary of the virgo , harbors gc populations with a wide spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "it is one of the best targets for the study of age and metal abundance using the integrated spectroscopy together with m87 , m49 , and m60 .",
    "there are several previous studies on the photometry , kinematics , and x - ray imaging of ngc 4636 gcs ( summarized below ) , but there is no published study of the metallicities , ages , and alpha - elements for the gcs based on spectroscopy .    the specific frequency of ngc 4636 gcs is @xmath13 , larger than those of other elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite .",

    "they also studied the radial variation , the rotation , and the orbit of ngc 4636 gc sub - populations .",

    "for the calibration of line indices , we used the spectra of five mw gcs ( m5 , m13 , m92 , m107 , and ngc 6624 ) observed in the long slit mode during the same observing run .    in figure [ fig - spec ]",

    "note that there are some sky - line residuals at @xmath15  , which are less than 2% of their original sky - lines .",
    "although these residuals remain because of incomplete distortion correction in the optics , they affect little the index analysis in this study .",
    "we measured two kinds of absorption line indices from the spectra of ngc 4636 gcs : ( 1 ) the @xcite line indices , used for determining the metallicities of gcs with empirical relations between absorption line indices and metallicities , and ( 2 ) the lick line indices , used for measuring the metallicities , ages , and alpha - elements from the comparison with ssp models .",
    "following subsections describe the measurement of each index .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented linear relations between absorption line strength indices obtained from the integrated spectra of old stellar systems and their mean metallicity to determine the metal abundance of the systems .",
    "their method was developed to minimize the systematic effects such as reddening , individual element abundance anomalies , and instrumental effects .",
    "they used the spectra and infrared colors of the mw gcs , m31 gcs , and ngc 188 giant stars for the metallicity calibration of the observed spectra .",
    "we measured the absorption line indices from the flux - calibrated spectra of ngc 4636 gcs after shifting each spectrum to the rest frame following the prescription of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "lick absorption line indices are useful for measuring the metallicity and age of old stellar systems from the integrated spectra with low / medium resolution @xcite .",
    "we measured the lick line indices as follows .",
    "we first smoothed our spectra with the lick resolution @xcite after shifting each spectrum to the rest frame .",
    "then we derived the lick line indices from the spectra of ngc 4636 gcs , following the definitions and the methods given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "line index errors are derived from the photon noise in the spectra before the flux calibration .",
    "then we calibrated the resulting line indices to the lick system with the zero point offset , @xmath24 , determined from the spectra of five mw gcs common in this study , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "we derived metallicity using three methods ( the brodie & huchra method , the lick index grid method and the @xmath28 minimization method ) , and age and [ @xmath0/fe ] using two methods ( the lick index grid method and the @xmath28 minimization method ) for ngc 4636 gcs .",

    "we use the method described in @xcite to derive metallicities from the absorption line indices for ngc 4636 gcs .",
    "they recommended six best indices ( g band , mgh , mg2 , fe5270 , cnb , and @xmath29 ) as the primary calibrators among the 12 line indices for the empirical relations between the bh line indices and the metallicities .",
    "we used , however , only four primary line indices to determine the metallicities of ngc 4636 gcs , excluding cnb and @xmath29 because of low s / n values in their wavelength range .",

    "grids indicate several values of [ z / h ] ( 2.25 , 1.35 , 0.33 , 0.0 , 0.35 , and 0.67 dex ) and ages ( 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , and 15 gyr ) from the ssp model with [ @xmath0/fe ]  = 0.2 .",
    "the ngc 4636 gcs show a large dispersion in ages ; most of them are old and some gcs are younger than 5 gyr .",
    "the gcs in ngc 4636 and in ngc 5128 show similar age distributions , while the latter have a relatively small number of young gcs than the former .",

    "since the dependence of the h@xmath10  versus [ mgfe]@xmath7  grid on [ @xmath0/fe ]  is not negligible , we need [ @xmath0/fe ]  information for accurate estimation of age and metallicity . an mg@xmath27  versus @xmath3fe@xmath5  grid also needs an age value for accurate estimation of [ @xmath0/fe ]  and metallicity .",

    "we repeat this iteration until the [ z / h ] difference converges to smaller than 0.01 dex . finally , the converged values are selected as final values of age , metallicity , and [ @xmath0/fe ]  of the gc .    to estimate the errors of the age , metallicity , and [ @xmath0/fe ]  values of a gc",
    ", we calculate ages , metallicities , and [ @xmath0/fe ]  values of the four data points composed of h@xmath10  @xmath37 error and [ mgfe]@xmath7  @xmath37 error in the h@xmath10  versus [ mgfe]@xmath7  grid and @xmath3fe@xmath5  @xmath37 error and mg@xmath27  @xmath37 error in the @xmath3fe@xmath5  versus mg@xmath27  grid .",
    "the difference between the average of these four values and the estimate directly calculated from the @xmath38 is taken as the final error for the age , metallicity , and [ @xmath0/fe ] of the gc .",
    "for some gcs outside the model grid , we adopt the value of the nearest envelope of the model grid in the direction of error vector as their estimates following @xcite . for example , if the data points are below the grid limit in the h@xmath10  versus [ mgfe]@xmath7  diagram , we adopt the maximum value of age ( i.e. 15 gyr ) at [ z / h ] @xmath39 dex , but the age value of about 12 gyr due to some overlapped grids at [ z / h ] @xmath40 dex . for the data points below the grid limit in the @xmath3fe@xmath5  versus mg@xmath27  diagram , we also adopt the maximum value of [ @xmath0/fe ]  ( i.e. 0.5 dex ) .      @xcite suggested a method that can measure the physical parameters ( metallicity , age , and alpha - elements ) for gcs in a robust way based on simultaneous fitting of all the available lick line indices with @xmath28 minimization .",

    "is also seen in the studies of the gcs in the large magellanic cloud using the high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite , and of the gcs in six nearby galaxies using the medium - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be very interesting to examine whether there is a global age - metallicity relation of gcs from dwarf galaxies to massive galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a semi - analytic model for the origin of the metallicity distribution of gcs using the galaxy merging history from the cosmological simulations coupled with observed scaling relations for the amount and metallicity of cold gas available for the star formation .",
    "they predicted that early mergers of small galaxies create exclusively mp gcs , while subsequent mergers with more massive galaxies create both mp and mr gcs .",

    "their result related to the mdf shape is not consistent with our result that the old gcs show a bimodal metallicity distribution .",
    "in addition , their result about the systematic age difference among gc systems is not consistent with our result in the sense that the mean ages of gcs in ges do not show any systematic dependence on the luminosity of ges as shown in figure [ fig - gesmagage ] .",
    "previously , several formation models of the gc systems in ges have been suggested @xcite and a summary of model descriptions and predictions can be found in several literature @xcite .",
    "considering the observational results on the kinematics and photometry of gcs in ges and predictions of several models available in the literature , @xcite presented a mixture ( bibimbap ) scenario describing the formation of gcs in ges .",
    "however , they did not use the information on chemical properties and ages of gcs in ges when they proposed their scenario . to be short , the scenario is as follows .",
    "( 1 ) mp gcs are formed mostly in low - mass dwarf galaxies very early , and preferentially in dwarf galaxies located in the high density environment like galaxy clusters .",
    "these are the first generation of gcs in the universe .",
    "mp gcs should be also formed in massive galaxies as well , but the number of these massive galaxies is much smaller than that of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "( 2 ) mr gcs are formed together with stars in massive galaxies or dissipational merging galaxies later than mp gcs , but not much later than mp gcs .",
    "the chemical enrichment of the galaxies is rapid after the formation of mp gcs and the difference in the formation epoch of mp gcs and mr gcs should be small .",
    "( 3 ) massive galaxies grow becoming ges via dissipationless or dissipational merging of galaxies of various types and via accretion of many dwarf galaxies .",
    "new mr gcs will be formed during the dissipational merging , but the fraction of dissipational merging at this stage should be minor . a significant fraction of mp gcs in ges we see today are from dissipationless merging or accretion .",
    "if we consider our results on ages and chemical properties in the view of this mixture scenario , we can conclude the followings .",
    "first , the point in the mixture scenario of @xcite that mp gcs in massive galaxies are formed early is consistent with our finding that most mp gcs in ges are older than 10 gyr .",
    "second , the small difference in the primary formation epochs of mp gcs and mr gcs in @xcite is consistent with our results that there is little difference in the mean ages of the mp and mr sub - populations of old gcs ( @xmath86 gyr ) .",
    "note that there is @xmath121 gyr difference in the case of the mw gcs that have more reliable age estimates ( @xmath111 gyr and @xmath112 gyr for the mp and mr gcs , respectively ) .",
    "important findings in this study are that ges have a significant number of young gcs and that they are mostly mr gcs .",
    "we also found that there are a smaller number of mp gcs with young ages ( @xmath120 gyr ) .",
    "the mr young gcs are probably formed during the dissipational merging of late - type galaxies with their host elliptical galaxies , while the mp young gcs are formed in dwarf galaxies and are accreted to their host galaxies .",
    "it is expected that the fraction of new mr gcs from the dissipational merging events depends on the environment such as the gas content of the merging companions and the local density where the merging happens @xcite .",
    "therefore , the fraction of young gcs would not be the same for all galaxies . in the case of ngc 4636 , a considerable fraction of young gcs with ages",
    "less than 5 gyr might be the result of recent merging with gaseous late - type galaxies .",
    "it would be worth investigating the environmental dependence of the gc systems in ges once the number of ges with spectroscopically measured metallicity and age for their gcs increases in the future .",

    "the number ratio for young ( @xmath75 gyr ) , intermediate ( @xmath133 gyr ) , and old ( @xmath86 gyr ) gcs is 27:39:34 from the grid method and 27:30:43 from the @xmath28 minimization method .",
    "the [ @xmath0/fe ]  distribution of the ngc 4636 gcs is broad with the mean of [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath134 from the grid method and of [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath135 from the @xmath28 minimization method , smaller than the value for the mw gcs .",
    "the metallicity , age , and alpha - element of the gcs in ngc 4636 do not show any significant radial variation .",
    "ngc 4636 gcs show a hint of the age - metallicity relation",
    "the gcs in the combined sample of ges show a bimodal metallicity distribution : peaks at @xmath1}=-1.21 ( \\sigma=0.32)$ ] , and @xmath88 from the grid method , and @xmath1}=-1.25 ( \\sigma=0.32)$ ] , and @xmath93 from the @xmath28 minimization method .",
    "the mp gcs are on average @xmath136 gyr older than the mr gcs .",
    "they show a large range in age from 2 to 15 gyr , including a significant number of young gcs , while all mw gcs are older than 7 gyr .",
    "the mr gcs show a broader age distribution than the mp gcs , showing that young gcs are mostly metal - rich .",
    "the mean [ @xmath0/fe ]  value of the combined ge gcs is smaller than that of the mw gcs .",
    ".   the number ratio of the young group and the old group is 1:3 for the mp gcs , and 1:1 for the mr gcs . in the case of the old group ,",
    "the mean ages for the mr and mp gcs are about 13 gyrs , and there is little difference in the mean ages between the mr and mp gcs .",
    "it is noted that the mean age for the mr gcs in the mw is about one gyr younger than that for the mp gcs . in the case of the young group ,",
    "the mean age for the mr gcs is about 5 gyr , which is about 2 gyr younger than that for the mp gcs .",
    "8 .   the results on metallicity , age , and [ @xmath0/fe ]  of gcs in ges as well as those on photometry and kinematics of gcs are consistent with the mixture scenario in @xcite .",
