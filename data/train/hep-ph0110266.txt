    "one of the puzzles of modern particle physics is the origin of the structure of masses and mixing in quarks and leptons .",
    "there have been many approaches to explain the yukawa couplings mostly based on some flavor symmetry .    in the supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "extension of the standard model , besides the renormalizable yukawa interaction , one can write non - renormalizable dimension 5 operators in the superpotential , which violate baryon and lepton numbers . after dressed by superparticles ,",
    "these operators induce nucleon decay @xcite .",
    "the present experimental limit on the nucleon lifetime gives very stringent bounds on these operators , whose coefficients must be much smaller than the inverse of the planck scale for weak - scale susy breaking .",
    "it is then natural to expect that the mechanism which explains the fermion mass structure will also explain the smallness of the genuine dimension 5 proton decay .",
    "some time ago , arkani - hamed and schmaltz @xcite proposed a new approach to these issues based on a fermion localization mechanism in extra spatial dimensions .",
    "it is known that chiral fermions are localized in solitonic backgrounds @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quarks and leptons have gaussian wave functions along one extra dimension under a kink background , and the overlap of the wave functions of the two quarks ( leptons ) determines the relevant yukawa coupling .",
    "the small yukawa couplings are then attributed to the small overlap of the wave functions .",
    "realistic configurations were given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the same way",
    ", the proton decay will be suppressed if the overlap of the wave functions of three quarks and one lepton is small .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether this idea indeed works in the context of supersymmetric grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "issues of the fermion masses in susy guts using the idea of the fermion localization were studied in ref .",
    "in addition to the quark and lepton chiral multiplets , the higgs supermultiplets are also assumed to have the gaussian wave functions along the extra dimension and realistic masses and mixing angles of quarks are obtained . here",
    "we extend their approach to include the proton decay operators in the analysis .",
    "we will show that one has to split the wave functions of the quarks in the same su(5 ) multiplet in order to obtain sufficient @xmath0 phase .",
    "the splitting is realized by the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that the same mechanism can realize the triplet - doublet higgs mass splitting and the suppression of the proton decay mediated by the triplet higgsino exchange .",
    "we shall obtain a configuration of the chiral multiplets in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which is consistent with the su(5 ) gut and explains the quark masses , the mixing angles and the @xmath0 phase , the charged lepton masses , and the suppression of the genuine dimension 5 proton decay .",
    "the resulting mass matrices of the quarks and leptons have a variant of fritzsch - type texture . in our approach",
    ", texture zeroes are attributed to very small overlap of the wave functions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the mechanism to localize the wave functions along the fifth dimension . in section 3",
    ", we explain the basic ideas of our approaches in the simple case where the wave functions have su(5 ) invariant form .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0 violation is too small in this case .",
    "then in section 4 , we split the wave functions to obtain sufficiently large @xmath0 phase . here",
    "we need to contrive to suppress dimension 5 proton decay operators .",
    "a workable configuration of the wave functions is given there . in section 5",
    ", we argue various energy scales of our model and discuss some subtle issues in this approach .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the localization mechanism of fields in the fifth dimension , which is based on the formalism of @xcite . throughout this paper , we consider @xmath1d su(@xmath1 ) susy gut with the fifth dimension @xmath2 compactified .",
    "5d planck scale is denoted by @xmath3 and the compactification scale by @xmath4 .",
    "we shall assume that 5d super - poincare invariance is broken in some way and only @xmath5 supersymmetry ( in 4d sense ) is respected .",
    "this allows us to write yukawa interactions in the bulk in the form of superpotential , as we will see shortly .",
    "an appropriate formalism will be provided by utilizing the idea of ( de)constructing extra dimensions @xcite which does not necessarily have 5d @xmath5 susy in the presence of matter interactions @xcite .",
    "let us thus consider the lagrangian @xmath6 \\phi(y )     + h.c .",
    "\\right\\ }   \\label{eq : lagrangian}\\ ] ] of @xmath1d spacetime . here",
    ", @xmath7 is a @xmath8d @xmath5 susy chiral superfield and @xmath9 is a charge conjugated chiral superfield , both of which combine to produce a @xmath1d @xmath5 susy hypermultiplet .",
    "@xmath10 is decomposed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar component of a background chiral superfield and @xmath13 is a mass parameter . as we mentioned above , the interactions in the superpotential ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) break 5d @xmath5 susy ( or @xmath14 in 4d susy ) .",
    "equations of motion for zero modes of scalar component @xmath15 and spinor one @xmath16 of @xmath7 are obtained as @xmath17 and for ones of @xmath18 as @xmath19 we assume that @xmath20 has a kink configuration along the fifth dimension and approximate it as @xmath21 near the origin .",
    "thus , by appropriate boundary conditions we obtain the zero mode wave functions with gaussian profile as @xmath22 ,    \\label{eq : gaussian}\\ ] ] localized around @xmath23 .",
    "if the extra dimension were non - compact , an anti - chiral zero mode would not exist under the kink background because its wave function would not be normalizable .",
    "however in the compactified extra dimension , the wave function will generically become normalizable , and one has to elaborate to forbid the anti - chiral zero mode . here",
    "zero modes for the anti - chiral fields , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are assumed to be absent .",
    "a possibility is that the anti - chiral zero modes will be projected out by an orbifold boundary condition .",
    "another possibility to realize such a situation is to consider a @xmath2 dependent @xmath26 ( wave - function ) factor in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , where the @xmath26 factor vanishes at the boundaries of the extra dimension .",
    "this makes the anti - chiral zero mode having non - normalizable wave function , and thus it does not survive .",
    "a detail on this realization will be given in appendix a.    there are also massive modes called kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes on top of these zero modes ( massless modes ) . for the time being , we will focus on the zero modes with gaussian profile ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) .",
    "in this and the next sections we try to produce the hierarchy of the fermion masses and very small proton decay operator coefficients , using the localization mechanism described above .",
    "the important point is that smallness of these constants is a consequence of small overlaps of wave functions .",
    "the main purpose in the two sections is to illustrate our procedure to determine localization points of fields to reproduce fermion mass matrices and survive proton decay constraints .",
    "we will obtain an almost realistic model except that it has no @xmath0 violating phase in the mass matrix .",
    "this model nicely illustrates our procedure because the structure is rather simple and also it suggests a hint how we should extend it to obtain non - vanishing @xmath0 violation",
    ". we will give in section 4 a more realistic model with @xmath0 violation .",
    "first , we consider the case that the mssm fields which belong to the same multiplet in su(@xmath1 ) have the same wave functions localized at the same point along the extra dimension .",
    "we assign the mssm matter fields to the su(@xmath1 ) multiplets as usual : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the left - handed quark doublet , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the charge conjugated right - handed up- and down - type quarks , @xmath31 is the left - handed lepton doublet , and @xmath32 is the charge conjugated right - handed charged lepton . in the minimal case ,",
    "higgs multiplets are @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mssm higgses and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are their color triplet partners .",
    "thus , the @xmath1d yukawa couplings which leads to fermion masses are @xmath38 where @xmath39 are dimensionless coefficients and @xmath40 are family indices . in non - minimal cases ,",
    "yukawa couplings take other form .",
    "any way , we assume that after su(@xmath1 ) breaking these couplings lead to @xmath41 for the moment , we concentrate on the quark sectors and discard the wrong relations between down - type quark masses and charged lepton ones .    substituting zero mode wave functions of the form ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) into eq.([eq : yukawa ] ) and integrating over the extra dimension , we obtain @xmath8d yukawa couplings . here",
    "we denote gaussian widths of the matters ( quarks and leptons ) , the up - type higgs and the down - type higgs by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , and define their ratios as @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that all matters have the same width for simplicity . relaxing this will not drastically change our main conclusions . without loss of generality , we set the location of @xmath34 at the origin . resulting @xmath8d up - type yukawa coupling constants are @xmath45    \\right\\ } , \\quad f_u^{ij } \\equiv f_u^{ij }",

    "similarly , down - type yukawa coupling constants are written as @xmath47    \\right\\ } , \\quad f_d^{ij } \\equiv f_d^{ij } \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{m_*}}.    \\label{eq : d_yukawa}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 represents the location of @xmath51 .    to obtain physical masses and mixings ,",
    "we must translate fields from flavor basis into mass basis through unitary matrices as @xmath52 from which we obtain the ckm matrix as @xmath53      next , we determine the locations of the fields using experimental data .",
    "@xmath1d yukawa coupling constants @xmath54 run from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , and then are matched to @xmath8d yukawa coupling constants @xmath55 , and run again to low energy scale .",
    "however we ignore the running between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and rescale yukawa coupling constants by using one - loop mssm renormalization group equations ( rge ) from the usual gut scale @xmath56 gev to the ew scale , by identifying that @xmath57 .",
    "this simplification is justified when we consider uncertainties of @xmath58 , @xmath59 in the 5d lagrangian .",
    "we adopt as experimental bounds the running quark masses evaluated at the @xmath26-boson mass scale @xcite @xmath60 the magnitude of the ckm mixing matrix @xcite @xmath61 and the jarlskog invariant @xcite @xmath62 which represents @xmath0 violation .",
    "first we seek the locations of @xmath63 from the observed up - type quark masses .",
    "since diagonal parts of @xmath64 contain the same field , we expect that @xmath64 is nearly diagonal .",
    "therefore in this case we can approximate locations of @xmath63 as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the standard model higgs and @xmath67 parameterizes the ratio of the mssm higgses vevs as @xmath68 . since @xmath69 for @xmath70 , @xmath71 are sensitive to @xmath72 .",
    "there are two types of @xmath73s configuration which can lead to realistic up - type quark masses .",
    "one is ( i ) @xmath74 type as in @xcite , and the other is ( ii ) @xmath75 type , up to sign .",
    "recall that the wave function of @xmath34 is localized at the origin , and thus the order one top yukawa coupling requires @xmath76 .",
    "for example , in the case that @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we obtain for the case ( i ) , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and for the case ( ii ) , @xmath81 , @xmath82 here we have used @xmath83 and the running quark masses are those at energy scale @xmath84 .",
    "after rge running to lower energy , these values can reside in the range given in eq.([eq : mass_exp ] ) .",
    "although both of the two cases , ( i ) and ( ii ) , succeed in obtaining up - type quark masses , they must also explain the null result of proton decay experiments .",
    "we impose @xmath85 parity to forbid dimension @xmath8 proton decay throughout this paper , and concentrate on genuine dimension @xmath1 proton decay operators suppressed by @xmath1d planck scale .",
    "ordinary dimension @xmath1 operators which arise from triplet higgs exchange can be adequately suppressed by the mechanism described in @xcite .",
    "namely using the splitting of the wave functions of the doublet and the triplet , we can realize the configuration that the triplet higgs fields are located far away from the quarks and leptons , suppressing the yukawa couplings of the triplet to them and thus the proton decay through the triplet higgs exchange .",
    "what we are concerned with are the genuine dimension @xmath1 proton decay operators which are induced from the following interactions : @xmath86 where the brackets are contracted to the fundamental and the anti - fundamental representations , and @xmath87 are constants which satisfy @xmath88 .",
    "since the gauge symmetry as well as the @xmath85-parity conservation does not forbid this type of interactions , we expect that they have unsuppressed coefficients @xmath89 . by integrating over the fifth dimension , the above operators lead to the genuine dimension @xmath1 proton decay operators @xmath90 in terms of @xmath8d fields . here",
    "@xmath91 are constants proportional to @xmath87 : @xmath92 ,     \\quad d^{ijkl } \\equiv d^{ijkl } \\frac{\\mu}{m _ * } ,    \\label{eq : pdecaycoe}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath94 denote @xmath95 s and @xmath96 s relative locations from @xmath63 , namely @xmath97 .",
    "note that @xmath98 and @xmath99 identically vanish because of the bose statistics .",
    "what we hope is that the coefficients @xmath91 become sufficiently small due to small overlaps of the wave functions , which we will study from now on .    in the above equation @xmath100",
    "are written in flavor basis , which are related to ones in mass basis as @xmath101    the decay mode @xmath102 gives the most severe constraints on these constants .",
    "the partial life time for this mode is larger than @xmath103 @xcite , which implies @xcite for the first term of eq.([eq : p_decay ] ) ( llll operators ) @xmath104    if cancellation among coefficients in the proton decay amplitudes does not occur .",
    "these values are those given at the gut scale . here , we have assumed a common mass @xmath105 to all superparticles in the mssm for simplicity , and @xmath106 represents the hadronic matrix element parameter , which is evaluated as @xmath107 by various methods @xcite .",
    "hereafter we take @xmath108 , and the largest value @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 represents one loop renormalization effect due to gauge interaction from @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "here we neglect effect due to yukawa interaction since it does not change our conclusions .    similarly , for the second term of eq.([eq : p_decay ] ) ( rrrr operators ) we have the following constraints : @xmath113 at the gut scale , where @xmath114 is also the hadronic parameter which satisfies @xmath115 and @xmath116 is renormalization effect .",
    "the appearance of @xmath117 is due to the fact that the proton decay diagram is generated by higgsino exchange , which inevitably depends on the yukawa couplings .",
    "first we decide the location of @xmath63 by considering constraints on the llll operators .",
    "if @xmath118 , we find @xmath119 when @xmath63 and @xmath95 are localized close to each other , the overlap of their wave functions becomes large . to suppress the proton decay , the localization point of the other one @xmath120 must be far away from them .",
    "numerically we find @xmath121 where @xmath122 on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath63 is localized far from @xmath95 , or more explicitly @xmath123 then we do not have any constraints on the position of @xmath120 , and thus arbitrary @xmath124 , namely @xmath125 , is allowed . using the bounds ( [ eq : bounds ] ) and taking @xmath126",
    ", we find if @xmath127 then the proton decay induced by the llll operators is always suppressed to an experimentally allowed level as far as @xmath128 .    in the case ( i ) ,",
    "@xmath79 do not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : alwaysok ] ) .",
    "thus the locations of the @xmath120 are very constrained .",
    "for instance , when @xmath129 , the region @xmath130 is prohibited even for @xmath131 .",
    "even if we take @xmath132 , the corresponding excluded region is @xmath133 . because of such large excluded regions , it is difficult to obtain realistic down - type quark masses and ckm parameters within at most @xmath46 relative distance .",
    "thus we will not consider the case ( i ) any more .",
    "on the other hand , in the case ( ii ) , @xmath81 ( with @xmath129 ) satisfy the conditions ( [ eq : alwaysok ] ) , and thus we do not have any constraints on the locations of @xmath120 .",
    "next we consider the rrrr operators . if @xmath134 , @xmath135 even for large @xmath117 constraints on these are weaker than ones from the llll operators , since matter sector has su(@xmath1 ) symmetry",
    "therefore , we expect that the case ( ii ) survives the proton decay constraint .    in the above consideration",
    "we have taken @xmath136 .",
    "thus the suppression of the proton decay rates only relies on the fact that @xmath137 lives far from the other fields .",
    "however , if @xmath138 or @xmath139 are different from the unit matrix , very rapid proton decay may be induced through off - diagonal elements , in particular from @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we will come to this point later on .      based on the aforementioned observations , we now seek locations of @xmath142 which generate realistic down - type quark masses and ckm parameters .",
    "the proton decay constraint prefers the case ( ii ) where @xmath137 lives on the opposite side of @xmath143 .",
    "it makes the structure of the mass matrix very interesting as we will see soon .",
    "let us suppose that the @xmath144 are placed in the following order along the extra dimension : @xmath145 with higgses localized around the third generation .",
    "this can lead to a variant of fritzsch type texture @xcite as follows @xcite @xmath146 approximate zeros arise in the matrix when the overlaps of the wave functions between @xmath142 and @xmath95 are extremely suppressed .",
    "@xmath147 is diagonalized as eq.([eq : ydiag ] ) . since we have @xmath148 , we can approximate @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , @xmath150 this leads to a prediction @xmath151 at @xmath84 . observed values satisfy this relation very well .",
    "we are now at the position to describe the configuration of the wave function locations which generate realistic fermion masses and mixings .    for simplicity , we set @xmath152 and @xmath153 . a choice of the parameter set ( see fig . [",
    "fig : profilegut ] ) @xmath154 yields yukawa coupling matrices @xmath155 these values give quark masses @xmath156 and the magnitude of the mixing matrix @xmath157 at @xmath84 . after the rge evolution , we obtain @xmath158 and @xmath159 at the @xmath26-boson mass scale . these are consistent with observed values .    as for proton decay , including contribution from off - diagonal elements of unitary matrices we obtain @xmath160 which survives the current experimental bounds ( [ eq : bounds ] ) .",
    "thus this mechanism succeeds to explain not only quark masses and mixings but also the suppression of the proton decay which arises from the genuine dimension @xmath1 operators . to get small numbers",
    ", we used only at most @xmath46 parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ some of @xmath161 and @xmath162 become @xmath163 .",
    "this is due to the gaussian profiles of the wave functions of the fields .",
    "a similar argument can apply for @xmath164 gut .",
    "however , it seems difficult to explain proton decay and mass matrices simultaneously as far as all matters in the same generation share a common wave function .",
    "one might worry that the configurations of fig .",
    "[ fig : profilegut ] would generate @xmath165 parameter ( the supersymmetric mass of the doublet higgses ) of order @xmath3 .",
    "this problem may be solved by introducing a singlet field @xmath166 localizing far from @xmath167 doublet higgses and considering the yukawa interactions @xmath168 to yield a small @xmath165 parameter @xcite .",
    "although we can obtain the realistic quark masses and mixings , the above texture in which up - type yukawa coupling matrix is diagonal can not generate sufficient @xmath0 violation @xcite in the ckm matrix .",
    "since up - type yukawa coupling matrix is diagonal , @xmath169 on the other hand , eq.([eq : fritzsch ] ) implies @xmath170 where @xmath171s represent non - zero values .",
    "thus , we find @xmath172 using this relation and the unitarity of the ckm matrix , we obtain a relation @xmath173 this is nothing but the prediction of eq.([eq : prediction ] ) and leads to @xmath174 which means there is no @xmath0 violation in the quark sector .",
    "in fact , the yukawa coupling matrices of eq.([eq : y_gut ] ) with arbitrary phases , give extremely small @xmath0 violation , numerically @xmath175 .",
    "another problem is that this texture predicts equality of down - type masses and charged lepton masses at @xmath84 .",
    "this is inevitable as far as gut breaking higgs does not couple with matters .",
    "in this section , we construct a model which explains the fermion masses , mixings , @xmath0 violation and the null results from proton decay experiments at the same time . as we saw in the previous section ,",
    "our approach gave almost realistic mass matrices .",
    "the two difficulties mentioned above are originated from the fact that the configurations of the wave functions of the quarks and leptons have su(@xmath1 ) invariant form , namely the fields belonging to the same multiplet have the same wave function along the extra dimension .",
    "thus we will consider how su(@xmath1 ) breaking is incorporated to improve these points . here",
    ", an adjoint higgs field @xmath176 , which spontaneously breaks the su(@xmath1 ) gauge symmetry , plays a crucial role in splitting the wave functions of the quarks from ones of the leptons which belong to the same multiplets @xcite , so that we obtain the sufficient @xmath0 violation and the mass difference between down - type quarks and charged leptons .",
    "let us here briefly review how the wave functions in a su(@xmath1 ) multiplet can be split after su(@xmath1 ) breaking .",
    "besides the usual matters , @xmath73 and @xmath7 , the model has their conjugate fields , @xmath177 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus we can write yukawa interactions of matters with the adjoint higgs @xmath176 , @xmath178 \\psi_i      + \\phi^c_i       \\left [ \\partial_y + \\bar{m}_i(y )         + \\frac{1}{3 } \\bar{g}_i \\sigma \\right ] \\phi_i      \\right\\}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath179 is a generation index , @xmath180 are yukawa coupling constants , and @xmath181 are position dependent @xmath1d masses including the @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the adjoint higgs @xmath176 develops the constant vev along the extra dimension @xmath182 by which the su(@xmath1 ) group is spontaneously broken . therefore , after the gut breaking , the above lagrangian becomes of the form @xmath183 where @xmath184 s are the mssm fields , @xmath185 and @xmath32 , and @xmath186 s are their conjugated fields , and @xmath187 represents the hypercharge of @xmath184 as @xmath188 and @xmath13 and @xmath189 include @xmath190 and @xmath191 . in this setting ,",
    "the locations of zero mode wave functions of the mssm fields are split as @xmath192 with @xmath193 since we no longer have su(@xmath1 ) symmetry in the matter sector , this mechanism can explain the difference between down - type masses and charged lepton masses without using georgi - jarlskog mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , the unification of @xmath194 and @xmath195 is accidental .",
    "the difficulty in generating sufficient @xmath0 violation in previous su(@xmath1 ) invariant case comes from the fact that the up - type yukawa matrix is diagonal .",
    "thus we will consider a slight deviation from the diagonal matrix for @xmath64 as follows : @xmath196 where complex phase only appears through the phase @xmath197 .",
    "since the above matrices have several zero entries , it is sufficient to consider only one phase .",
    "we keep elements @xmath198 and @xmath199 zero in order to avoid rapid proton decay .",
    "otherwise , proton decay coefficients in mass basis @xmath200 may become too large by rotating unsuppressed coefficients e.g. @xmath201 by @xmath202 .",
    "the unitary matrices which contribute to the ckm matrix are decomposed in orthogonal matrices @xmath203 and a phase matrix @xmath204 as @xmath205 these give the ckm matrix , @xmath206 for @xmath207 like in the previous su(@xmath1 ) invariant case , obviously @xmath208 . on the other hand , for @xmath209 as in eq.([eq : nondiag ] ) @xmath0 violation compatible with experimental results can arise .    in the texture of eq.([eq :",

    "a natural expectation is @xmath231 . in order",
    "that all our previous arguments are justified , @xmath31 must be sufficiently large : otherwise we would have different configurations for wave functions . to obtain the fermion mass hierarchy we need that @xmath232 is at least order 10 .",

    "wave functions for the kk modes obey the following eigenvalue equations @xmath234 l_n & = & m_n^2 l_n    \\nonumber \\\\   \\left [ - \\partial_y^2 + m^2(y ) + \\partial_y m(y ) \\right ] r_n & = & m_n^2 r_n    \\label{eq : eq_of_motion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath85 represent components of chiral superfields and anti - chiral super fields respectively , and @xmath235 labels the excitation level of a kk mode and @xmath236 is its mass . for @xmath237 , eq.([eq : eq_of_motion ] ) become @xmath238 l_n & = & m_n^2 l_n      \\nonumber \\\\    \\left [ - \\partial_y^2 + ( 2 \\mu^2 y)^2 - 2 \\mu^2 \\right ] r_n & = & m_n^2 r_n ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the wave functions are written in terms of hermite polynomials .",
    "thus a kk mode with mass @xmath239 is localized with narrow width .",
    "a higher kk mode has a more spread wave function , but is still bounded . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath240 , since ` energy ' @xmath241 is always larger than ` potential ' @xmath242 , kk modes can freely propagate all over the extra dimension .",
    "such kk modes , if exist in the color triplet higgses would be very dangerous , as they would mediate unacceptably fast proton decay . to be safe ,",
    "we should introduce cut - off below @xmath3 to eliminate such freely propagating kk modes .",
    "the ( de)constructing extra dimension naturally provides such a cut - off . in this scenario ,",
    "a ( dynamical ) scale @xmath243 is implemented in the theory . below the energy scale @xmath243",
    ", the theory looks 5 dimensional with one extra dimension . above this scale ,",
    "the extra dimension is resolved and the theory looks 4 dimensional with gauge group @xmath244 with @xmath245 being some large integer . in this setup , it is very natural to expect that there is no kk mode above @xmath243 , which provides the cut - off we want to have .",
    "furthermore in the ( de)constructing extra dimension , gravity does not propagate this extra dimension , so that we can identify the 5d planck scale @xmath3 with the 4d ( reduced ) planck scale @xmath246 gev .    summarizing these arguments",
    ", we find that a set of the parameters as @xmath247 provide an example of the setting in which our mechanism works .",
    "perturbativity of 5d gauge interactions requires @xmath248 where @xmath189 is a gauge coupling constant and @xmath249 is the number of the kk modes below the cut - off @xmath243 .",
    "we expect that @xmath250 and thus with the gauge coupling of order unity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : perturbation ] ) is satisfied .",
    "in this paper , we have pursued a very natural expectation that the mechanism which explains the masses and mixing of the quarks and leptons should also explain the smallness of the dangerous genuine dimension 5 proton decay operators in supersymmetry .",
    "this philosophy provides a test of models of flavor and here we applied to the mechanism of localizing fermions under kink background along the extra dimension .",
    "we showed that the localization mechanism can provide a successful configuration of the wave functions of the chiral multiplets which is consistent with the susy su(5 ) and yields the realistic fermion mass structure and suppresses the dimension 5 proton decay .    here",
    "we would like to summarize our ingredients on the localization mechanism .",
    "* the mechanism advocated by arkani - hamed and schmaltz is used . in this approach",
    ", there exists a singlet filed @xmath20 which has a kink configuration along the extra dimension .",
    "bulk fermions are assumed to have yukawa interactions with the singlet in the bulk , which is a necessary ingredient of this localization mechanism .",
    "the width and the localization of the fermion wave function are controlled by the yukawa coupling and the invariant mass of the fermion . in the context of susy",
    ", @xmath251 full susy would prevent such yukawa interactions in the superpotential .",
    "we argue that in the deconstructing extra dimension @xmath251 susy can be explicitly broken to @xmath252 @xmath5 susy , allowing the desired superpotential . * in order to obtain a chiral theory , one needs to elaborate to kill anti - chiral zero modes",
    ". one way would be to consider a @xmath253 orbifold compactification , in which appropriate boundary conditions would allow only chiral zero modes .",
    "an alternative way is to consider a non - trivial @xmath26 factor for the fermion kinetic terms , in which @xmath26 vanishes at the boundaries . in this case , the anti - chiral zero modes have non - normalizable wave functions and thus they do not exist .    to obtain a realistic configuration ,",
    "one further requires    * splitting of wave functions in a single su(5 ) multiplet is required to have a non - vanishing ckm phase . * appropriate couplings and masses",
    "should be chosen to reproduce the fermion masses and mixing and to suppress the proton decay to an experimentally acceptable level .    in this paper",
    ", we extensively discussed the su(5 ) gut .",
    "it is interesting to consider the case of so(10 ) and larger groups .",
    "here we briefly mention the so(10 ) case .",
    "as is well - known , all quarks and leptons as well as a right - handed neutrino can be embedded into a single 16 dimensional representation in so(10 ) .",
    "these fields in the same multiplet are localized in different points after the so(10 ) breaking . to see this point closely ,",
    "let us consider the following symmetry breaking chain @xmath254 . in the first symmetry breaking , 10 , @xmath255 , and @xmath256 ( right - handed neutrino ) in su(5 ) terminology are split .",
    "thus our arguments given for the su(5 ) case can apply to this case .",
    "a crucial difference is that the positions and widths of the right - handed neutrinos are not freely chosen , but are related to those of 10 and @xmath255 because the splitting is attributed to the expectation value of the higgs responsible for the breaking @xmath257 .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the realistic neutrino masses and mixing are realized in this case , which is however beyond the scope of this paper .    to conclude",
    ", the idea of the fermion localization along the extra dimension can pass the phenomenological test of models of flavor .",
    "our explicit construction shows that this idea can indeed work .",
    "of course , ours is just one possibility among divergent approaches to the extra dimensions .",
    "further investigation along this line should be encouraged .",
    "after completion of this work , we received a preprint @xcite which deals with a similar subject .",
    "this work was supported in part by the grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan , priority area ( # 707 ) `` supersymmetry and unified theory of elementary particles , '' and in part by the grants - in - aid no.11640246 and no.12047201 .",
    "in this appendix , we describe a mechanism to obtain only the zero modes of a chiral superfield @xmath7 while forbidding those of a charge conjugated chiral superfield @xmath9 in five dimensions with the extra dimension compactified on the orbifold @xmath258 .",
    "the key point for this mechanism to work is introduction of a @xmath26 factor with a non - trivial profile along the extra dimension . here",
    ", we assume that the @xmath26 factor is nearly constant in the bulk but vanishes at the boundaries of the extra dimension . here",
    "we do not specify the origin of the @xmath26 factor .        integrating over the extra dimension",
    ", we obtain @xmath265 if the wave functions @xmath266 satisfy the following eigenvalue equations : @xmath267 notice that the mass term @xmath10 is practically replaced with @xmath268 . in particular , the equations for the zero modes are written @xmath269 whose general solutions are easily obtained as @xmath270 where @xmath271 are normalization constants . since @xmath268 diverges at the boundaries of the extra dimension , one of the zero - mode wave functions , say @xmath272 , is not normalizable .",
    "thus there exists only the chiral zero mode for @xmath7 .",
    "notice that the shape of the zero mode @xmath273 is not changed drastically compared with the case @xmath274 .",
