    "phase transition is an important phenomenon in particle physics , cosmology , and condensed matter physics .",

    ", the electro - weak phase transition should be first order for electro - weak baryogenesis @xcite and is investigated attentively @xcite .",
    "needless to say , a variety of phase transitions are observed and investigated precisely in condensed matter physics .",
    "+ field theoretical approach is essential in order to investigate these phase transitions : finite - temperature / chemical - potential field theory @xcite , perturbative and non - perturbative renormalization group @xcite , field theory on lattice @xcite , and so on .",
    "temperature can be naturally introduced by statistical principle using finite - temperature field theory .",
    "not all the phase transitions , however , can be investigated by it ; the perturbation theory , which is the most powerful method at zero temperature , often breaks down around the critical temperature because of many interactions in thermal bath @xcite .",
    "indeed the perturbation theory fails , when it is applied to either a second - order or a weakly first - order phase transition . +",
    "drummond et.al.@xcite proposed a new method using an auxiliary mass in order to avoid this difficulty .",
    "we utilized their idea and developed a new method to calculate the effective potential .",
    "we , then , investigated the phase transition of the scalar model using the _ auxiliary - mass method _ and showed it is second order correctly @xcite .",
    "it is a great advance in finite - temperature field theory , because the phase transition in the scalar model is indicated to be first order incorrectly by the perturbation theory with daisy resummation @xcite .",
    "we note that the method was able to reproduce the result with super - daisy approximation @xcite .",
    "+ since the equation we must solve in the auxiliary - mass method is a non - linear partial differential equation for the effective potential , it can not be solved analytically and must be solved by a numerical method .",
    "it is , however , difficult to solve partial differential equations numerically because of the numerical instability @xcite .",
    "what is worse , the non - linearity of the equation prevents us from using the methods established in case of a linear equation .",
    "we could not , therefore , make mesh size arbitrary small ; the investigation in ref.@xcite was not accurate quantitatively . in the present paper ,",
    "we use an improved numerical method given in the appendix , which do not suffer from the instability , and get accurate universal quantities . unlike the rough values in @xcite",

    "the thermal correction is left and the quantum correction is neglected here , too . of course , @xmath15 can not be calculated exactly ; we need an appropriate approximation in order to calculate the effective potential from ( [ ini ] ) . because the effective potential is a generating function of n - point functions with zero external momentum , neglect of momentum dependence in @xmath15 allows us to replace as follows , @xmath16 the evolution equation ( [ evo1 ] )",
    "can be converted to partial differential equation using this replacement as follows , @xmath17    the effective potential can be calculated by solving the partial differential equation ( [ evo2 ] ) with the initial condition ( [ ini ] ) .",
    "the effective potential has an imaginary part below the critical temperature and an analytic continuation is done so that this imaginary part is negative @xcite . since the evolution equation ( [ evo2 ] ) is complicated non - linear partial differential equation , it can be solved only by numerical methods .",
    "we calculate the effective potential numerically using the method in the appendix . the real part of the effective potential as temperature varies is shown in fig.[potr ] . a stable field expectation value @xmath18 , where the effective potential has its minimum , comes to be zero smoothly as temperature increases .",

    "the numerical method , which we use to solve ( [ evo2 ] ) , is explained in this appendix . the partial differential equation ( [ evo2 ] ) is written as follows , @xmath58 here",

    "the method with this selection is called the explicit method , which we used in @xcite .",
    "this method is simple , because @xmath73 is determined only by substituting @xmath74 into the right hand side .",
    "it , however , suffers from a numerical instability , when smaller mesh @xmath75 is chosen @xcite ; therefore , we could not make mesh small in @xcite . if @xmath76 is selected , the laplacian is evaluated at ( b ) in fig.[lattice ] .",
    "the method with this selection is called the implicit method , which does not suffer from the numerical instability at least if f(x ) is a linear function @xcite  as far as we know , when @xmath59 is not linear function like our case , not many things are known .",

    "first method is based on the taylor expansion of @xmath59 .",

    "we , then , expand @xmath59 around @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 this coupled equation is linear with respect to @xmath73 and can be solved easily @xcite .",
    "+ the second method is based on an iteration . in order to solve equation ( [ cra ] ) , we iterate as follows until a solution is found , @xmath82 here , n is the number of the iteration .",
    "note that we can not replace @xmath83 with @xmath84 unlike the gauss - seidel method , which is a powerful method if @xmath59 is a linear function @xcite .",
    "next , relaxation method is used in order to improve the convergence @xcite . since this procedure is identical with the linear case , we only write down the iteration equation without an explanation .",
    "@xmath85 here , the relaxation parameter @xmath86 is determined only by experience .",
    "the results by the two methods agree greatly . in the present paper ,",
    "the latter method is used in order to determine the universal quantities .",
