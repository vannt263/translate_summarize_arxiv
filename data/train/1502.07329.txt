    "whereas it is well - known since faltings proof  @xcite of the mordell conjecture that a curve of general type ( and so of genus @xmath2 ) over  @xmath1 can have only finitely many rational points , not much is known in general for rational points on _ surfaces _ of general type .",
    "the bombieri - lang conjecture predicts that the set  @xmath3 of rational points on a surface  @xmath0 of general type is not zariski dense ; this is analogous to faltings theorem .",
    "this conjecture is open in general , but when @xmath0 has a finite tale covering  @xmath4 that is a subvariety of an abelian variety , then its truth follows from a generalization of faltings result and descent theory .",
    "see section  [ s : lang ] for a more detailed discussion",
    ". we can then ask whether it is possible to obtain an explicit description of  @xmath3 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to initiate an investigation of this question by considering a special class of surfaces as a case study .",
    "the class of surfaces we look at are the so - called _ primary burniat surfaces_.    primary burniat surfaces are certain surfaces of general type first constructed by burniat  @xcite in the 1960s as smooth bidouble covers of a del pezzo surface of degree  @xmath5 . their moduli space @xmath6 forms a  @xmath7-dimensional irreducible connected component of the moduli space of surfaces of general type as shown by mendes lopes and pardini  @xcite using an argument related to the degree of the bicanonical map .",
    "this result was reproved by bauer and catanese in  @xcite , where the authors also show the rationality of  @xmath6 .",
    "their proof makes use of the fact ( also proved in the same paper ) that burniat s surfaces can also be obtained as tale quotients of certain hypersurfaces in products of three elliptic curves , a construction first considered by inoue  @xcite .",
    "it is this description that allows us to show that lang s conjectures on rational points on varieties of general type hold for primary burniat surfaces .",
    "in fact , we recall a more general statement for projective varieties admitting an tale covering that embeds in a product of abelian  varieties and curves of genus at least two .",
    "this applies in particular for certain so - called inoue type varieties , see section  [ s : lang ] .    after recalling the two different constructions of primary burniat surfaces in section  [ s : burniat ]",
    ", we produce an explicit description of their moduli space as a subset of  @xmath8 in section  [ s : moduli ] .",
    "we then use this description to classify the possible automorphism groups of primary burniat surfaces .",
    "generically , this automorphism group is @xmath9 , but its order can get as large as  @xmath10 ; see section  [ s : auto ] .    by the general theorem given in section  [ s : lang ] , we know that the set of rational points on a primary burniat surface  @xmath0 consists of the points lying on the finitely many curves of geometric genus  @xmath11 on  @xmath0 , together with finitely many ` sporadic ' points . to describe this set  @xmath3 explicitly , we therefore need to determine the set of low - genus curves on  @xmath0 .",
    "this is done in section  [ s : low ] .",
    "the result is that @xmath0 does not contain rational curves , but does always contain six smooth elliptic curves , and may contain up to six further ( singular ) curves of geometric genus  @xmath12 .    in the last part of the paper",
    ", we discuss how the set @xmath3 can be determined explicitly for a primary burniat surface  @xmath0 defined over  @xmath1 .",
    "we restrict to the case that the three genus  @xmath12 curves whose product contains the tale cover  @xmath4 of  @xmath0 are individually defined over  @xmath1 .",
    "we can then write down equations for  @xmath4 of a somewhat more general ( but similar ) form than those used in section  [ s : moduli ] where we were working over  @xmath13 . we explain how to determine the finitely many twists of the covering @xmath14 that may give rise to rational points on  @xmath0 , see section  [ s : explicit ] , and we discuss what practical methods are available for the determination of the sets of rational points on these twists , see section  [ s : find ] .",
    "we conclude with a number of examples .",
    "we start giving a short account on some conjectures , which were formulated by s.  lang  @xcite after discussions with an input from several other mathematicians .",

    "theorem  [ t : cw ] shows that there is a finite field extension @xmath37 such that @xmath38 . if some of the curves occurring as factors in  @xmath42 do not contain @xmath44-rational points , then @xmath45 and hence @xmath46 are empty , and there is nothing to show",
    "otherwise , we can use a @xmath44-point on each curve as a base - point for an embedding into its jacobian variety , so that we can consider @xmath41 as a subvariety of an abelian  variety  @xmath19 defined over  @xmath44 . note that @xmath41 is of general type as well",
    "; in particular , @xmath41 can not be a translate of an abelian  subvariety of  @xmath19 .",
    "now theorem  [ t : faltings ] implies that @xmath46 is not zariski dense in  @xmath41 .",
    "it follows that @xmath47 and therefore also its subset  @xmath16 are not zariski dense in  @xmath4 .    if @xmath41 does not contain any translate of an abelian  subvariety of  @xmath19 of positive dimension ( which is equivalent to the assumption in  ( 2 ) ) , then the finitely many translates in theorem  [ t : faltings ] are actually finitely many points , so that @xmath46 is finite .",
    "this implies that @xmath16 is also finite .",
    "finally , kawamata s result  [ t : kawamata ] applies to  @xmath41 , so if @xmath48 denotes the zariski closure of the union of translates of positive dimensional abelian  subvarieties of  @xmath19 which are contained in @xmath41 , then @xmath49 whence also @xmath50 .",
    "note that the special subvariety  @xmath17 of  @xmath4 is exactly  @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , by what we have seen already , @xmath52 is finite",
    ". therefore also @xmath53 is finite .",
    "since @xmath15 can be replaced by any finite extension , the last claim follows .",
    "[ r : twists ] for the purpose of actually determining  @xmath16 , we assume in addition that the covering  @xmath54 is geometrically galois , so that @xmath41 is an @xmath4-torsor under a finite @xmath15-group scheme  @xmath55 that we also assume to act on  @xmath42 .",
    "( @xmath55 is allowed to have fixed points on  @xmath42 , but not on  @xmath41 . )",
    "this allows us to use the machinery of descent ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "there is then a finite collection of twists @xmath56 of the torsor @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "this collection of twists can be taken to be those that are unramified outside the set of places of  @xmath15 consisting of the archimedean places , the places dividing the order of  @xmath55 and the places of bad reduction for  @xmath4 or  @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath55 also acts on  @xmath42 by assumption , we have @xmath59 for the corresponding twists of  @xmath42 .",
    "the general form of such a twist is a product of a principal homogenous space for some abelian  variety with some curves of higher genus or weil restrictions of such curves over some finite extension of  @xmath15 ( the latter can occur when the action of  @xmath55 on  @xmath42 permutes some of the curve factors ) . write @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the ` abelian  part ' and @xmath62 is the ` curve part ' . by faltings theorem , @xmath62 has only finitely many @xmath15-rational points .",
    "fixing such a point  @xmath63 , the fiber  @xmath64 above  @xmath63 of @xmath65 is a subvariety of the principal homogeneous space  @xmath61 .",
    "so either @xmath66 is empty , or else we can consider @xmath61 as an abelian variety , so that faltings theorem applies to  @xmath64 .",
    "this shows that @xmath66 is contained in a finite union of translates of abelian  subvarieties of  @xmath61 that are contained in  @xmath64 .",
    "since there are only finitely many  @xmath63 , the corresponding statement holds for  @xmath67 as well .",
    "the advantage of this variant is that it allows us to work with @xmath15-rational points on  @xmath41 and its twists , rather than with @xmath44-rational points on  @xmath41 for a ( usually rather large ) extension  @xmath44 of  @xmath15 .",
    "so if we have a way of determining the translates of abelian  subvarieties of positive dimension contained in  @xmath41 and also of finding the finitely many @xmath15-rational points outside these translates for each twist of  @xmath41 , we can determine  @xmath16 .",
    "we will pursue this approach when @xmath4 is a primary burniat surface in sections [ s : explicit ] , [ s : find ] and  [ s : examples ] below .    in the same spirit we can state the following :",
    "let @xmath4 be a smooth projective variety of general type over a number field  @xmath15 which admits a finite tale covering @xmath36 such that the irregularity of @xmath41 satisfies @xmath68 then @xmath16 is not zariski dense in @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath69 , then @xmath4 contains only finitely many curves of geometric genus 0 or  1 , and the set of @xmath15-rational points on  @xmath4 outside these curves is finite .",
    "again it suffices to show that @xmath46 is not zariski dense in @xmath41 for some suitable finite extension  @xmath44 of  @xmath15 .",
    "we can assume that there is a point @xmath70 ; let @xmath71 be the albanese morphism of  @xmath41 that sends  @xmath72 to zero and note that @xmath73 is defined over  @xmath44 .",
    "assume that @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath75 is a proper abelian  subvariety of  @xmath19 of dimension @xmath76 by faltings result .",
    "this is a contradiction , since @xmath77 spans  @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a surface , then we can use lu s or kawamata s result to deduce the finiteness of the set of low - genus curves on  @xmath4 .",
    "theorem  [ t : general ] applies to a generalization of inoue s construction of burniat s surfaces , the so - called _ inoue type varieties _ , which were recently introduced in  @xcite , and which proved to be rather useful in the study of deformations in the large of surfaces of general type .",
    "in fact , it turned out that for inoue type varieties one can show under certain additional conditions that any smooth variety homotopically equivalent to an inoue type variety is in fact an inoue type variety .",
    "this often allows to determine and describe the connected components of certain moduli spaces of surfaces of general type , since it implies that a family yields a closed subset in the moduli space .",
    "for details we refer to the original article  @xcite .",
    "we recall below the definition of a _ classical inoue type variety _ as given in  @xcite .",
    "this is not sufficient for the results on moduli spaces , but is good enough for our study of rational points .    a complex projective variety @xmath4",

    "the action of @xmath55 on @xmath86 is induced by an action on @xmath42 .",
    "a classical inoue type variety is of general type , and if it is defined over a number field  @xmath15 ( such that the @xmath55-action is also defined over  @xmath15 ) , then it satisfies the assumptions of theorem  [ t : general ] and also remark  [ r : twists ] .",
    "taking @xmath87 ( to keep the computations feasible ) , we obtain a large class of examples of varieties of general type for which one can try to use the approach of remark  [ r : twists ] to determine the set of rational points explicitly .",
    "the so - called _ burniat surfaces _ are several families of surfaces of general type with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , first constructed by p.  burniat in  @xcite as singular _ bidouble covers _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath90 galois covers ) of the projective plane  @xmath91 branched on a certain configuration of nine lines .",
    "later , m.  inoue  @xcite gave another construction of surfaces ` closely related to burniat s surfaces ' with a different technique as @xmath92-quotients of an invariant hypersurface of multi - degree  @xmath93 in a product of three elliptic curves . in  @xcite it is shown that these two constructions give exactly the same surfaces .",
    "in fact , concerning statements about rational points on burniat surfaces , inoue s construction is much more useful than the original construction of burniat , as will be clear soon .",
    "we briefly recall burniat s original construction of burniat surfaces with @xmath94 , which were called _ primary _ burniat surfaces in  @xcite .    consider three non - collinear points @xmath95 , which we take to be the coordinate points , and denote by @xmath96 the blow - up of  @xmath91 in  @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath40 is a del  pezzo surface of degree  @xmath5 and it is the closure of the graph of the rational map @xmath98 such that @xmath99    we denote by @xmath100 the exceptional curve lying over @xmath101 and by @xmath102 the unique effective divisor in @xmath103 , i.e. , the proper transform of the line @xmath104 , side of the triangle joining the points @xmath105 . here",

    "assume also that all the corresponding lines in  @xmath91 are distinct , so that @xmath112 is a reduced divisor .",
    "in this description , the subscripts are understood as residue classes modulo  3 .",
    "if we define the divisor @xmath113 , then @xmath114 and we can consider the associated bidouble cover @xmath115 branched on  @xmath116 .",
    "compare figure  [ figburniat ] .",
    "observe that @xmath0 is nonsingular exactly when the divisor @xmath116 does not have points of multiplicity  3 ( there can not be points of higher multiplicities ) .    a _ primary burniat surface _ is a surface  @xmath0 as constructed above that is non - singular .",
    "a primary burniat surface @xmath0 is a minimal surface with @xmath117 ample .",

    "the goal of this section is to provide such an explicit moduli space based on inoue s construction . as a by - product",
    ", we obtain another proof of its rationality .",
    "we will also use our approach to classify the possible automorphism groups of primary burniat surfaces , see section  [ s : auto ] below .",
    "we work over  @xmath13 .",
