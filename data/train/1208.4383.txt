    "our first aim in this note is to suggest a general approach towards a classification up to isomorphism of nilpotent semigroups of a fixed coclass . for this purpose",

    "illustrations of parts of such graphs can be found as figure  [ figcc1 ] on page   and as figure  [ figcc2d2 ] on  .",
    "we have investigated various of the graphs @xmath20 and we observed that all these graphs share the same general features .",
    "we formulate a sequence of conjectures and theorems describing these features .",
    "if our conjectures become theorems , then this would provide the ground for a new approach towards the classification and investigation of nilpotent semigroups by coclass .",
    "in particular , it would show how the classification of the infinitely many nilpotent semigroups of a fixed coclass reduces to a finite calculation .    as a second aim in this note we exhibit some graphs @xmath20 explicitly to illustrate our conjectures .",
    "we have determined the graphs @xmath22 and @xmath23 for all fields @xmath8 using the classification of the nilpotent semigroups of small coclass in @xcite ; see sections [ cc0 ] and [ cc1 ] .",

    "the idea of using the coclass for the classification of nilpotent algebraic objects has first been introduced by leedham - green & newman @xcite for nilpotent groups .",
    "we also refer to the book by leedham - green & mckay @xcite for background and many details on the results in the group case .",
    "various details of the approach taken here are similar to the concepts in group theory .",
    "in particular , the idea of searching for periodic patterns in coclass graphs as used below also arises in group theory ; we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "note though that a nilpotent semigroup is not a group and hence the coclass theories for groups and semigroups are independent .",
    "in this section we investigate general features of the graph @xmath20 for @xmath27 and arbitrary field @xmath8 .    by construction , every connected component of @xmath20 is a rooted tree . using basic results on nilpotent semigroups ( see  ( * ? ? ? * lemma 2.1 ) ) one readily shows that @xmath28 is an upper bound for the dimension of a root ( that is , the dimension of the corresponding algebra ) in @xmath20 .",

    "hence conjecture [ conjb ] asserts that the unlabelled tree @xmath31 can be constructed from a finite subgraph , provided that a weak defect and a weak period are known .",
    "this implies that @xmath30 has finite width .",

    "these are both commutative algebras ; the first has an annihilator of dimension 2 generated by @xmath223 and @xmath245 and the second has an annihilator of dimension 1 generated by @xmath245 . hence the algebras are non - isomorphic .",
    "secondly , we consider @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "these are both non - commutative algebras and they both have an annihilator of dimension 1 ; the first has a right annihilator of dimension 2 generated by @xmath223 and @xmath245 and the second has a right annihilator of dimension 1 generated by @xmath245 .",
    "hence the algebras are non - isomorphic .",
    "this proves our claim in the case @xmath196 or @xmath5 odd . in the case @xmath248 and @xmath5 even , there is the additional algebra @xmath249 .",
    "this is a commutative algebra whose annihilator has dimension 1 ; hence we have to distinguish @xmath249 from @xmath244 .",
    "assume that @xmath250 is an isomorphism and denote @xmath251 .",
    "then @xmath252 in @xmath244 , as @xmath253 holds .",
    "note that @xmath254 in @xmath244 and @xmath255 as @xmath256 in @xmath257 .",
    "an inspection of the coefficients now shows that @xmath258 for @xmath259 .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath245 in @xmath260 thus is @xmath261 . since @xmath248",
    ", it follows that @xmath262 .",
    "this yields that @xmath263 .",
    "hence @xmath37 is not surjective , a contradiction .",
    "we determine the edges of @xmath23 . consider a semigroup @xmath7 of order @xmath5 from the above classification . in the quotient @xmath264 the two elements @xmath245 and",
    "@xmath265 are identified , and hence the quotient is isomorphic to a semigroup of type @xmath266 of order @xmath267 .",
    "note that the later is valid for @xmath268 also , as the semigroups @xmath266 can be defined for order @xmath191 as well .",
    "the labels of the vertices in @xmath23 follow immediately from the classification .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 has strong defect 2 and strong period 2 .",
    "( in fact , both values are minimal . )",
    "images of the parts of @xmath269 corresponding to semigroups of order at most @xmath270 for @xmath271 with @xmath272 can be found at  @xcite .",
    "a classification of semigroups of coclass @xmath194 is available in @xcite .",
    "we used it to investigate @xmath24 computationally , applying the isomorphism test for associative nilpotent algebras over finite fields in  @xcite .",
    "semigroups of coclass @xmath194 have a minimal generating set of size @xmath194 or @xmath189 . we know from section  [ sec_mingen ] that these two cases lead to independent subgraphs @xmath273 and @xmath274 of @xmath24 which shall be considered separately .",
    "we have determined the part of @xmath273 corresponding to semigroups of order at most @xmath270 for @xmath271 with @xmath272 .",
    "images of the graphs are available at  @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that for every field @xmath8 the graph @xmath273 has five maximal infinite paths which are described by the following infinite dimensional algebras :    @xmath275 with annihilator @xmath276 ;    @xmath277 with annihilator @xmath278 ;    @xmath279 with annihilator @xmath280 ;    @xmath281 with annihilator @xmath278 ;    @xmath282 with annihilator @xmath278 .    using these presentations to define semigroups with zero",
    "we obtain infinite semigroups that are annihilator extensions of the semigroup underlying @xmath193 and whose contracted semigroup algebras are the algebras defined by the presentations .",
    "if the conjecture on the number of infinite paths holds , then @xmath273 contains five maximal coclass trees .",
    "figure  [ figcc2d2 ] exhibits the respective trees of the computed graph for @xmath283 .",
    "furthermore our computational evidence suggests the following :    the graph @xmath284 depends on @xmath285 only ;    the vertices in @xmath284 outside a maximal coclass tree have dimension @xmath191 or @xmath286 ;    the roots of the maximal coclass trees of @xmath284 have dimension @xmath191 ;    each maximal coclass tree in @xmath284 is strongly virtually periodic ; one tree has strong defect @xmath111 and strong period @xmath111 , the other four trees have strong defect @xmath194 and strong period @xmath194 ;    the arising strong defects and strong periods are independent of the field .",
    "additionally the polynomials describing the labels in the periodic parts of the maximal coclass trees have degree at most @xmath111 , a fact that follows from the classification in  @xcite .     up to depth 12 . ]    the graph @xmath274 is known to consist of a single maximal coclass tree with root @xmath287 and infinite paths corresponding to @xmath288 by theorem  [ mingen ] .",
    "we have determined the part of @xmath274 corresponding to semigroups of order at most @xmath270 for @xmath271 with @xmath289 .",
    "images of the graphs are available at  @xcite . in all three cases we found the graph to appear strongly virtually periodic with strong defect @xmath194 , and strong period @xmath194 . in accordance with the results from  @xcite",
    "the labels can be described by quadratic polynomials .",
    "for the semigroups of coclass @xmath189 there is no general classification known .",
    "we computed the semigroups of coclass @xmath189 and order at most @xmath290 up to isomorphism using the code provided in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix c ) .",
    "then we determined the part of @xmath291 correspondig to these semigroups for @xmath271 with @xmath272 .",
    "images of the graphs are available at  @xcite .",
    "we summarise our observations :    the graph @xmath292 depends on @xmath285 only ;    the graph @xmath292 has @xmath293 maximal infinite paths of which @xmath191 correspond to commutative algebras ;    the vertices in @xmath292 outside a maximal coclass tree have dimension @xmath294 , @xmath295 or @xmath296 ;    the roots of the maximal coclass trees of @xmath292 have dimension @xmath286 , @xmath294 or @xmath295 ;    the maximal coclass trees in @xmath292 are strongly virtually periodic with strong defect at most @xmath189 and strong period at most @xmath294 ;    the arising strong periods are independent of the field ;    the polynomials describing the labels have degree at most @xmath111 .",
    "these observations for @xmath292 are of particular interest as this is the first case in which some of the semigroups contain products of three elements that lie in different monogenic subsemigroups .",
    "in fact , @xmath292 has in many aspects more complex features than all other considered graphs .",
    "we have investigated the part of @xmath297 correspondig to semigroups of order at most @xmath270 for @xmath298 only .",
    "there appear to be @xmath299 maximal infinite paths in @xmath300 with @xmath286 paths corresponding to commutative algebras .",
    "the graph @xmath301 has @xmath111 maximal infinite paths corresponding to the commutative algebra @xmath302 by theorem  [ mingen ] .",
    "similar to the graphs @xmath20 one can define a graph @xmath26 whose vertices correspond one - to - one to the isomorphism types of semigroups of coclass @xmath15 .",
    "two vertices are adjoined by a directed edge @xmath303 if @xmath304 where @xmath1 is the class of @xmath7 .",
    "it follows directly from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.1 ) that the graph @xmath26 does not have finite width ( unless @xmath141 ) .",
    "the additional use of the contracted semigroup algebras in the definition of @xmath20 induces a dependence on the underlying field @xmath8 , but it has the significant advantage that the graphs @xmath20 seem to have finite width and exhibit periodic patterns which can be described in a compact way .",
    "further , the considered field @xmath8 seems to have no influence on the important aspects of the periodicity ."
