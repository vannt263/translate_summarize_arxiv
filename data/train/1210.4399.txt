    "understanding the mechanisms responsible for producing high - energy non - thermal radiation in extreme astrophysical sources , such as agn and pulsars , relies on having a complete picture of the emission across the em spectrum .    in practice",
    "though , huge sensitivity gaps exist , in particular @xcite between the domain of high sensitivity of @xmath0-ray telescopes based of compton scattering ( mainly sub - mev ) and those based on @xmath1-pair creation ( mainly above 100 mev ) .",
    "several projects exist to improve the sensitivity of compton telescopes at the high end of their energy range .    for @xmath1-pair telescopes ,",
    "the main obstacle is the degradation of the angular resolution at low energy due to multiple scattering of the conversion electrons : event selection and background rejection become increasingly difficult , which ultimately limits the sensitivity .",
    "furthermore , none of the previous ( cos - b , egret ) or present ( fermi / lat ) @xmath1-pair telescopes have ( had ) any significant sensitivity to the polarisation of the incoming photon , a diagnostic that is a powerful tool in the radio , optical and x - ray bands and that is missing for @xmath0-rays .",
    "gamma - rays are emitted by cosmic sources in a variety of non - thermal processes , some of which such as synchrotron radiation or inverse compton scattering provide linearly polarized radiation to some extent , while others , such as nuclear interactions , end up producing non polarized photons .",
    "most compton telescope projects include polarimetry , but the polarization asymmetry of compton scattering decreases as @xmath2 for @xmath3 , so that compton polarimetry becomes inefficient above a couple of mev @xcite .",
    "the fermi / lat , the @xmath0-ray mission presently in space , uses a w / si converter / tracker followed by a csi electromagnetic calorimeter : a thick technology for which the effective area is the product of the geometrical area by the efficiency , @xmath4 . over most of the energy range ( up to 10 gev ) ,",
    "the angular resolution is dominated by multiple scattering in the tungsten slabs .    in a thin detector @xcite ;    * only a fraction of the incoming photons are converted , and effective area becomes the product of the cross - section of the conversion process of interest and the sensitive mass , @xmath5 .",
    "+ for an argon - based tpc the effective area becomes larger than @xmath6 above a couple of mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aeff ] ) , while the effective area of the three - ton fermi / lat plateaus at @xmath7 only above 1 gev @xcite .",

    "the fermi curves ( `` front '' and `` back '' events ) are from the parametrization of ref . @xcite . ]",
    "+ the energy measurement that is obtained from multiple measurements of multiple scattering of the tracks in the detector at low energy must be complemented by an additionnal system at higher energy , which will be chosen to be a `` thin '' system too , so as not to overrun the mass budget , e.g. using a magnetic spectrometer . *",
    "the angular resolution is improved by one order of magnitude ( figure [ fig : resolution : angulaire ] ) , and therefore the background rejection factor for point - like sources by two orders of magnitude .",
    "* polarimetry is performed by analysis of the distribution of the azimutal angle of the recoil electron in triplet conversion , i.e. the conversion of the incoming photon in the electric field of an electron of the detector , @xmath8 .",
    "the magnitude of the recoil momentum is typically of the order of @xmath9 , the detection of which requires a low density medium .    a time projection chamber ( tpc ) i.e. , an homogeneous",
    ", 3d finely instrumented medium is particularly well suited for such a detection .",
    "we have built a demonstrator consisting of a 5-bar argon - based cubic tpc , with a size of 30 cm , and with a pitch , sampling frequency and diffusion - induced resolution of about 1 mm .",
    "the amplification is performed with a `` bulk '' micromegas mesh @xcite , the signal collected by two orthogonal strip sets , and digitized with chips @xcite developed for t2k @xcite .    after we have characterized its performance as a tracker under ( charged ) cosmic rays in the laboratory",

    "a resistance divider is built with a set of pairs of resistances of 10 , which are paired to an homogeneity of about @xmath12 .",
    "after drift , the ionisation electrons are amplified by a `` bulk '' micromegas with a gap of 128 , and collected on a pcb segmented in two series of orthogonal strips , one of which is made of regular copper strips , the other of rectangular pads which are connected by vias to strips lying within the pcb ( fig .",

    "the signal is digitized by an after chip @xcite , with 72 channels and a range of 12 bits , a shaping time of 100 ns and a maximum sampling rate of 50 , with a maximal number of time bins of 511 .",
