    "<S> we present a theory for site dilution in the valence bond crystal phase of the kagome lattice heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of an empty site leads to strong singlet bonds across the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> it also creates a free spin , which delocalizes inside the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> finite concentration of quenched impurities leads to a valence bond glass phase . </S>",
    "<S> this phase has short - range valence bond order , no spin - gap , large spin - susceptibilities , linear specific heat due to two - level systems , as well as singlet and triplet excitations that decompose into kink - anikink pairs delocalized over a few lattice constants . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a framework for a comprehensive understanding of thermodynamic , neutron , and raman measurements in the herbertsmithite material zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 , including recently reported @xmath3 and @xmath4 scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> the kagome lattice heisenberg model ( klhm ) is one of the most studied realistic quantum spin - models where resonating valence bond ( rvb ) physics , first proposed by anderson@xcite more than twenty five years ago , may be realized . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> extensive degeneracy at the classical level and in the space of valence bond configurations leads to the possibility of quantum spin liquids as well as many competing or coexisting orders.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental studies of the herbertsmithite materials zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1cl@xmath2 , containing structurally perfect kagome planes,@xcite have raised hope of realizing rvb physics in a real material . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , these materials have a pyrochlore structure , where spin - half copper atoms form kagome layers , which are separated by non - magnetic zinc containing triangular layers . </S>",
    "<S> this ideal case is now known to be not true as substitution of some fraction of zinc and copper sites leads to extra isolated spins in the zinc planes and site - dilution in the copper planes .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a theory for site dilution in klhm in context of dimer series expansions . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we find that dilution leads to a valence bond glass phase , which has short - range valence bond order , no spin - gap , large spin - susceptibility , linear specific heat due to two - level systems as well as singlet and triplet excitations that decompose into kink - antikink pairs with energies spread upto approximately @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the vbc phase , which is stabilized by higher order quantum fluctuations , with energy scales less than @xmath6 j per site ( energy scales that differentiate different vbc phases are only @xmath7 j per site ) , the vbg phase is stabilized by second order perturbation theory with an energy scale of order @xmath8 j per site . </S>",
    "<S> this vbg phase provides a novel framework for a comprehensive understanding of the herbertsmithite materials .     proposed valence bond phase of the kagome lattice heisenberg model consists of a honeycomb lattice of resonating hexagons ( h ) , where six hexagons surround a pinwheel ( p ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pinwheels are isolated from empty triangles leading to substantially reduced quantum fluctuations and doubly degenerate dimer configurations . ]    a single impurity can be accomodated in the valence bond crystal phase in several inequivalent positions of the 36-site unit cell with nearly equal energy . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of such an impurity leads to strong singlet bonds across from it , in agreement with earlier studies of dommange et al.@xcite however , contrary to the work of dommange et al , we find that the impurity also creates a free spin , which delocalizes inside the unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> the herbertsmithite materials have a large impurity concentration of order six percent , which would imply on average 2 randomly placed impurities per unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the singlet bonds across from the impurities , it also means 30 percent of spins are inactive . at this high impurity concentration no semblence of long range </S>",
    "<S> vbc order would remain . </S>",
    "<S> instead , one obtains a randomly pinned valence bond glass phase with only short range valence bond order . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the vbg description leads to a consistent picture for thermodynamics , neutron and raman scattering experiments in the herbertsmithite materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the dimer expansions provide a hirearchy of energy scales for different order quantum fluctuations in the klhm ( we set @xmath9).@xcite a dimer configuration has energy @xmath10 . after including second order quantum fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> the energy of each dimer configuration is lowered to @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that at this level all dimer configurations lead to the same energy . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the exact ground state energy of klhm is known from a variety of numerical studies to be @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the entire set of higher order quantum fluctuations beyond second order change the energy of the system by only another @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the first selection in the space of dimers comes from the occurance of resonating hexagons.@xcite in 3rd order , having a maximally allowed number of such hexagons lowers the energy of the state to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> these hexagons also contribute a fraction of the fourth order perturbation theory , that brings the energy to approximately @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the favored vbc configuration , which is selected in fourth order perturbation theory is shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that the same vbc configuration has been obtained variationally in a completely unbiased tensor - network formalism by evenbly and vidal.@xcite    the addition of holes lifts the degeneracy of the dimer configurations already in second order perturbation theory . for a finite concentration of holes , not having a strong bond in a triangle with a missing spin </S>",
    "<S> raises the energy of the dimer configuration by about @xmath16 if one bond opposite the missing spin is absent and @xmath8 if both bonds opposite the missing spin are absent . </S>",
    "<S> given this relatively large energy scale , it is fair to assume that these impurities freeze all quantum fluctuations except those involving ( i ) a pair of neighboring dimers ( second order perturbation ) , ( ii ) resonating hexagons and ( iii ) pinwheels and analogous structures . </S>",
    "<S> because the pinwheels have a doubly degenerate dimer configuration , they play a vital role in the vbg phase at low impurity concentration .     </S>",
    "<S> dimer configurations around the impurity , when the impurity is placed ( i ) in the inner hexagon , ( ii ) on the outer vertices , and ( iii ) in the bond neighboring the pinwheel . </S>",
    "<S> fig ( a ) through ( c ) show the dimerization pattern , with the thickness of the lines showing the strength of the singlet bonds . </S>",
    "<S> note that the other side of the impurity in ( b ) and ( c ) is a non - fluctuating singlet bond . </S>",
    "<S> fig ( d ) through ( f ) show the distribution of free spins . </S>",
    "<S> the filled circles show the positive spin expectation values , whereas empty circles show negative values . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the circle represents the size of the spin . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we first ask the question , how would the crystal respond to a single impurity ? given the many inequivalent sites , the crystal is free to adjust itself to place the impurity at any site . </S>",
    "<S> second order perturbation theory tells us that the impurity will prefer to go to one of the bonds that do not touch any empty triangles . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown as the dark bonds in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 . they are the same bonds that lead to heavy ( non - mobile ) triplets in the vbc phase.@xcite to a high numerical approximation , there are three inequivalent sites where the missing spin can go . these are ( i ) the inside hexagon of the pinwheel , ( ii ) the outside vertices of the pinwheel and ( iii ) on one of the dark bonds that are not part of the pinwheel . </S>",
    "<S> the structures are all bounded from outside by dimerized triangles , which are in their ground state . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it suffices to diagonalize the pinwheels only , plus the extra triangle in case ( iii ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the ground state bond energies and spin configurations for the three cases are shown in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) through ( c ) show the pattern of dimerization around the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) through ( f ) show how the free spin is delocalized over the pinwheel . in all cases , the energy cost of removing a spin is not @xmath17 as for an isolated dimer but rather approximately @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the system chooses to put a strong singlet bond across the impurity , which gets back the lost @xmath17 of energy . </S>",
    "<S> instead an antikink develops in the pinwheel , which is known to have a minimum energy of approximately @xmath18 . the actual energy cost in the three examples is found by exact diagonalization to be approximately 0.2764 , 0.2632 and 0.2468 in cases ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet bond across the impurity has strength @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the bond patterns have a clear resemblence to the study of dommange et al.@xcite    in contrast to the dark bonds , if the impurity is placed on the grey bonds , the resulting free spin can delocalize through the network of grey bonds . </S>",
    "<S> it can not delocalize too far because of the confining dimerizing field , but the dimerization between the weak and strong bonds connecting the empty triangles is relatively weak . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the confining potential is weak and the spin can delocalize over several unit cells .    with a finite concentration of randomly placed impurities </S>",
    "<S> , there will be lots of free spins created . </S>",
    "<S> when two of these spins meet they would bind into a singlet.@xcite the mobile spins can also wander into the pinwheel regions and form singlets with spins there . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the pairing will depend on the ability of the spins to be in overlapping regions and thus would decrease rapidly with separation of impurities . in a thermodynamic system of randomly placed impurities , </S>",
    "<S> most of the spins would be paired into singlets at t near zero . </S>",
    "<S> only very rare regions with isolated impurities will have a free spin . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a zero spin - gap for the system . at infinitesimally small impurity concentration </S>",
    "<S> there would be a 1/t susceptibility with a strength proportional to the impurity concentration . </S>",
    "<S> but , at any significant impurity concentration this strength would be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> we show in appendix that the assumption that these spins go into a random singlet phase@xcite with a power - law distribution of exchange constants , allows us to reproduce the @xmath3 and @xmath4 scaling reported recently.@xcite    the glassy system has many potential two - level system type local excitations created by the impurities . for very dilute impurities , the pin - wheels would serve as two level systems . the random environment would produce a weak random exchange field on the pinwheels giving rise to a small splitting , between its two ground states . in a higher concentration range , as relevant for the herbertsmithite materials , very few intact pinwheels are likely to remain . instead , at larger impurity concentration , the two - level systems would be a network of corner sharing triangles , where the valence bonds can switch between alternate dimer configurations , with very little energy cost . </S>",
    "<S> these would resemble delta chains or husimi trees,@xcite a pinwheel being just one special case . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume one two level system per 36-sites and further assume that their splitting can range upto @xmath22 percent of @xmath23 ( approximately 20 k ) that would lead to a density of states of @xmath24 per copper atom . </S>",
    "<S> this will give rise to a linear term in specific heat of approximately @xmath25 per copper atom . </S>",
    "<S> this is in the right ballpark of the experimental observations on the herbertsmithite materials when the spin degrees of freedom associated with free spins in the zinc planes , are supressed by a magnetic field.@xcite    the very low energy magnetic response will depend on the dm interactions,@xcite which are not considered here . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the nmr spectra has already been addressed by rousochatzakis et al in context of frozen dimers and it requires non - zero dm interactions in addition to impurities.@xcite the vbg phase also provides a natural explanation for the observed neutron spectra in the materials . </S>",
    "<S> one of the key observations of recent powder diffraction neutron measurement of the materials by devries et al@xcite is that the spectra is spread over a large frequency range and its angle averaged behavior is very close to that of isolated dimers . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly what one expects for pinwheels or delta chains , as we show below .     </S>",
    "<S> kink - antikink or 2-spinon states for the pinwheel . </S>",
    "<S> a triplet excitation is created by breaking a singlet bond in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the kink spinon lies on the inner hexagon , while the more mobile antikink spinon can move on the outside vertices of the pinwheel through states ( a ) through ( f ) shown in the figure . ]    </S>",
    "<S> because the ground state of a pinwheel is fully dimerized , the equal - time correlation function is strictly nearest - neighbor only , that is , it is that of isolated dimers . however , the triplet excitations in these systems decompose into a kink - antikink pair as shown in fig .  3 . hence the dynamic correlations are not strictly nearest - neighbor only and unlike a single dimer they extend over a wide energy range . </S>",
    "<S> it is known@xcite that the kinks are gapless and anti - kink energy can be approximated by @xmath26 so that the kink antikink pair energy ranges approximately from about @xmath27 to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have found by exact diagonalization that @xmath29 percent of the spectral weight of the pinwheel is spread over the energy @xmath30 to @xmath31 . also , as shown in fig .  4 </S>",
    "<S> , the angle - integrated spectra at every energy has q dependence that is very close to that of isolated dimers . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that delta chains have spectra spread over a wide energy range yet have angle integrated spectral weight essentially that of isolated dimers , in agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of dilution also provides a simple explanation for the absence of large peaks at low energy in the raman spectra@xcite that were found in exact diagonalization studies of finite clusters.@xcite the pinning of dimers destroys the low energy singlets , by making any long - range rearrangement of dimers energetically costly . </S>",
    "<S> light scattering should produce two antiparallel triplet excitations on neighboring dimers . </S>",
    "<S> two of these spins can combine into a singlet to leave a kink - antikink pair or two anti - kinks one of which is trapped in a triangle with a valence bond . in either case , this leads to energy spread over the same range as the triplets , i.e. , roughly upto @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the exact diagonalization results of laeuchli and lhuillier@xcite show that once the low energy peaks are removed from the spectra the frequency dependence of the neutron and raman scattering profiles are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> it supports the idea of two weakly interacting spinons which can form singlets or triplets . </S>",
    "<S> hao and tchernyshyov have shown@xcite that these excitations have fermionic statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum excitation energy is reduced when one does nt have perfect pin - wheel structures and the absence of spin - gap means that raman scattering should also extend down to zero energy . </S>",
    "<S> these features are , indeed , consistent with the experiments.@xcite     exact diagonalization results for angle averaged dynamic structure factor for a pinwheel , at different frequencies , scaled to have the same maximum , compared with results of a single dimer . ]    </S>",
    "<S> since the disordered glass phase breaks no symmetry , there should be no phase transition in the system and only a gradual crossover from the high temperature paramagnet to the vbg phase . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature scale for the freezing is set by @xmath32 , but some strong bonds may freeze at temperatures approaching @xmath23 giving one a broad crossover region . indeed the neutron scattering measurements suggest that dimer correlations persist beyond @xmath33 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the raman spectra show a clear development of a quasi - elastic peak at low energies as the temperature is raised from @xmath34 to @xmath35.@xcite this is suggestive of a gradual melting of the valence bond glass into a classical valence bond liquid as the frozen dimers are freed up , giving rise to lots of low energy overdamped singlet excitations . </S>",
    "<S> details of the raman spectra , including dependence on polarization@xcite deserve further theoretical attention .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a picture for the valence bond glass phase when the kagome lattice heisenberg model is randomly diluted . </S>",
    "<S> we have argued that this phase has no spin - gap , and supports local two - level system excitations as well as singlet and triplet excitations that decompose into kink - antikink pairs that delocalize over a local network of corner sharing triangles . </S>",
    "<S> this phase provides a consistent picture of thermodynamic , neutron and raman measurements in the herbertsmithite materials . </S>",
    "<S> significantly reduced concentration of impurities can help provide clearer signatures for the valence bond crystal phase in the kagome lattice heisenberg model .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to thank fabrice bert , mark de vries , joel helton , michael hermele , andreas laeuchli , peter lemmens , frederic mila , and oleg tchernyshyov for many valuable discussions and to phillipe mendels for an invitation to paris , where many of these ideas were crystalized . </S>"
