    "the investigation of atomic physics properties of semiconducting quantum dots ( qds ) is a popular topic for fundamental as well as applied physics .",
    "such nanostructures restrict the motion of charge carriers to a confined region of space .",
    "two qds are never identical , because of the crucial role of phonons , surface effects or bulk disorder on their electronic structure , but they may be advantageously considered as artificial giant atoms . thanks to their adjustable quantized energy spectrum , controlled only by their size , they may be used , for example , as semiconductor lasers @xcite , single - photon sources @xcite , _ qubits _",
    "@xcite , single - electron transistors @xcite , artificial _ fluorophores _ @xcite . in the early 1980s , the so - called quantum size effects ( qse ) , characterized by a blue - shift of their optical spectra , has been observed in a large range of strongly confined systems @xcite .",
    "it comes from a widening of the semiconductor optical band gap , due to the increase of the charge carriers confinement energy @xcite .",
    "modern methods as well as empirical pseudo - potential methods or _ ab initio _ approaches , such as the density functional theory ( dft ) , which are appropriate for numerical determination of semiconductor bulk band structures or confinement energies , are discussed in refs .",
    ". however , to the best of our knowledge , no comprehensive approach , which offers a significant analytic treatment , seems to exist at present .    in this work ,",
    "to explore their analogy with real atoms , we look at the interaction of a spherical semiconductor qd with a quantized electromagnetic field and investigate the lamb shift of its energy levels . discovered and actively studied in the late 1940s @xcite , the lamb shift still remains nowadays an area of intense research , for example within dielectric materials @xcite , on the excitation modes of an electromagnetic cavity @xcite , or on the coupling of electromagnetic modes to the semiconductor qd surface @xcite .",
    "recent works also present experimental protocols , in which lamb shifts enhanced by an electromagnetic cavity are measured in nanostructures like _ transmon _ @xcite or studied in semiconducting qds coupled to a planar slab of negative - index material @xcite .",
    "however , the lamb shift , well understood for real atoms , seems not to be approached neither theoretically nor experimentally in semiconductor qds .",
    "the object of this paper is to fill this gap by offering a consistent theoretical treatment leading to the evaluation of the shifts for a wide range of realistic spherical semiconductor qds . to describe a confined electron - hole pair",
    ", it seems appropriate to use the popular effective mass approximation ( ema ) model @xcite .",
    "we first review the tools needed to work out the lamb shift in section * [ sec_2 ] * , and the basic properties of a spherical semiconductor qd in section * [ sec_3]*. from there on , we deduce , in sections * [ sec_4 ] * and * [ sec_5 ] * , the lamb shift for a massive charged particle confined by an infinite potential well . as this lamb shift is _ negative _ , we comment , in section * [ sec_6 ] * , our result to emphasize the difference with the positive lamb shift observed in real atoms . in section * [ sec_7 ] * , for spherical semiconductor qds , we show that there exists a possibility to observe experimentally the lamb shift , at least in a so - called strong confinement regime and for a judiciously chosen semiconductor .",
    "we also suggest a protocol , built on the casimir effect , which might allow to observe this predicted lamb shift , despite the fundamental non - degeneracy of semiconducting qd levels .",
    "a concluding section summarizes our main results and indicates possible future research perspectives .",
    "in 1947 , investigations on zeeman effect in hydrogen atom showed that its fine structure does not agree with the predictions of dirac theory @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-level , which should be degenerated with @xmath1-levels , is actually shifted by an energy @xmath21057mhz , the so - called lamb shift .",
    "theoretical work demonstrated that it arises from the coupling of the electron motion with the surrounding quantized electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "consider a non - relativistic spinless massive particle of mass @xmath3 and of charge @xmath4 interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "it is represented by the pauli - fierz hamiltonian in the coulomb gauge @xcite , here written in units where @xmath5 , @xmath6 the particle hamiltonian in absence of electromagnetic field @xmath7 is supposed to be diagonal in an orthonormal basis of its eigenvectors @xmath8 with energy eigenvalues @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are interaction hamiltonians , and @xmath12 is the free electromagnetic field hamiltonian , @xmath13 being the vector potential , @xmath14 and @xmath15 the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the electromagnetic field is second quantized in the coulomb gauge @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath16 will not be taken into account on the basis of weak intensities of light sources involved * of chapter * xiii * in ref .",
    "we now review the results of the two main approaches to the lamb shift .",
    "the bethe approach to the lamb effect is purely perturbative . the quantum second order time independent degenerate perturbation theory is applied to the pauli - fierz hamiltonian @xmath17 , where hamiltonians @xmath18 and @xmath16 are treated as perturbations in the weak field limit @xcite . using renormalization arguments , the lamb shift for an energy eigenstate @xmath19",
    "is found to be given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fine structure constant written in the chosen units system .",
    "@xmath22 is the mean value of energy level difference absolute values .",
    "historically , this predicts a lamb shift for the hydrogen atom @xmath0-level in excellent agreement with experimental values @xcite .    in the welton approach , the lamb shift is interpreted as a fluctuation effect on the particle position due to its interaction with the surrounding electromagnetic field .",
    "these fluctuations @xmath23 can be described as a continuous random variable , whose probability density is a three - dimensional centered isotropic gaussian distribution of variance @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a ir cut - off , and @xmath3 is used as a natural uv cut - off consistent with non - relativistic assumption , discarding fluctuation modes of order of the particle compton wavelength @xcite .",
    "the particle then evolves in a new effective potential @xmath26 , averaged on the fluctuation distribution , which can be written as , it is summable in general .",
    "however , a fully quantum treatment , _",
    "i.e. _ both particle and electromagnetic field dynamics are quantized , is needed .",
    "it has been then shown that the averaged effective potential @xmath26 can be obtained from the _ bare _ potential @xmath27 by applying the well - defined differential operator @xcite @xmath28 ] @xmath29 where ellipsis dots ``  '' denote terms of order higher than first order in @xmath30 .",
    "the corrective term @xmath31 of the first order in @xmath30 is precisely the term giving rise to the lamb shift @xmath32 comparison of this result with eq .",
    "( [ deltae_lamb ] ) shows that the ir cut - off @xmath25 can be identified to @xmath22 in the bethe result .",
    "this also means that @xmath33 should not depend on the quantum numbers @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "first , a qd may be considered as spherical if it possesses an aspect ratio , defined as the ratio of its longest over its shortest axe , smaller than 1.1 .",
    "for example , according to the growth scheme used to synthesize @xmath35 nanocrystals , one can produce spherical qds of radius in the range of a few tens   @xcite or even less @xcite , as well as rod - shaped qds , so - called nanorods , having an aspect ratio up to more than 10 @xcite .",
    "the general issue of the shape of semiconducting qds , and how qds of different shapes should be experimentaly obtained by appropriate growth technique , is extensively treated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next , it is admitted that , under reasonable physical assumptions , semiconductor qds may be described by ema models in a first approximation .",
    "the most important one is the parabolicity of the semiconductor band structure @xcite .",
    "this assumption may be efficiently amended in several ways .",
    "a review presenting the usual possibilities to do so is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we use the standard ema model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , as a first attempt to apprehend the lamb effect in semiconductor qds .",
    "electrons and holes are assumed to be non - relativistic spinless particles of effective masses @xmath36 , confined in an infinite spherical potential well @xmath37 the electron - hole coulomb interaction is to be taken into account subsequently by the ritz variational principle .",
    "but , they are also consequently isolated from the insulating surrounding of the qd .",
    "the electromagnetic field amplitude should not then exceed some threshold , so that charge carriers would not leak out by tunnel effect .",
    "this working assumption is known as the weak field limit .",
    "such model leads to an overestimation of the electron - hole pair ground state energy for small qds , which can be corrected by restoring a confining finite potential step of experimentally acceptable height @xcite .",
    "other qd models with parabolic confinement @xcite or parabolic potential superimposed to an infinite potential well @xcite exist .",
    "but , the concept of qd size is no longer well - defined since their eigenfunctions are delocalized .      the electron - hole coulomb interaction @xmath38 is taken into account in the total hamiltonian @xmath39 where @xmath40",
    ", @xmath41 denotes the semiconductor dielectric constant , @xmath42 the electron - hole relative distance , and @xmath43 the electron and hole confinement hamiltonian . without loss of generality",
    ", the semiconductor energy band gap @xmath44 may be set equal to be zero for convenience .",

    "the respective energy eigenvalues for electron and hole are expressed in terms of @xmath56 as @xmath57    the interplay between quantum confinement energy , scaling as @xmath58 , and coulomb interaction , scaling as @xmath59 , can be described by the ratio @xmath60 of the qd radius @xmath61 over the bohr radius of the bulk mott - wannier exciton @xmath62 , @xmath63 being the reduced mass of the exciton . as an exact analytic solution is beyond reach ,",
    "two regimes are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in this regime ,",
    "valid for @xmath64 , the electron - hole relative motion is so affected by the infinite potential well , that _ exciton _ states should be considered as uncorrelated electronic and hole states .",
    "the coulomb potential is considered as a perturbation with respect to the infinite confining potential well .",
    "a variational approach is used to obtain the electron - hole pair ground state , with the following trial function @xmath65 which is a product of non - interacting charge carriers ground state wave functions with an interaction wave function of the form @xmath66 , @xmath67 being a variational parameter .",
    "the electron - hole pair energy minimization selects the value @xmath68 , and yields the ground state energy*. ] @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the electron - hole pair ground state confinement energy , and @xmath71 the binding exciton rydberg energy @xcite .      in this regime ,",
    "valid for @xmath72 , the exciton retains its character of a quasi - particle of total mass @xmath73 .",
    "its center - of - mass motion is confined , and should be quantized .",
    "the coulomb interaction remains a perturbation to the infinite confining potential well , and the variational function @xmath74 should be kept .",
    "however , the qd size allows for a partial restoration of the long range coulomb potential between the charged carriers , such that the coulomb energy and the kinetic energy in electron - hole relative coordinates are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "then , the leading contribution to the ground state energy of the exciton should be @xmath75 , which may be viewed as the ground state energy of a hydrogen - like atom of mass @xmath63 . the total translational motion of the exciton , should be restored and contribute to the exciton total energy by a term @xmath76 , _",
    "i.e. _ the ground state energy of a free particle trapped in a region of size @xmath61 .",
    "the exciton center - of - mass can not reach the infinite potential well surface unless the electron - hole relative motion undergoes a strong deformation .",
    "the exciton should be preferably treated as a rigid sphere of radius @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a phenomenologically determined function of @xmath79 @xcite . on this basis , to improve the description of the excitonic ground state , we let the center of mass motion in the variational procedure be represented by a plane wave @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the center - of - mass coordinates and @xmath82 is vector quantum number of unit norm @xmath83 .",
    "the trial function @xmath74 takes now the form @xmath84 this leaves the exciton probability density unchanged as well as the coulomb potential matrix element , whereas the confinement hamiltonian @xmath85 mean value gets the appropriate further contribution @xmath76 .",
    "the variational calculation yields @xmath86 , and a ground state variational energy of @xmath87 where terms of fourth and higher order terms in @xmath88 are neglected .",
    "an analytical expression for @xmath78 can now be extracted from eq .",
    "( [ e^weak_eh ] ) , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the exciton ground state energy @xmath89 of @xcite , differs from eq .",
    "( [ e^weak_eh ] ) by the term @xmath90 , interpreted as a kinetic energy term in the relative coordinates .",
    "as the virial theorem in this set of coordinates should be satisfied , this energy should be already contained in the rydberg energy term @xmath75 , and therefore should be removed . an elegant way to do this consists in introducing a pseudo - potential @xmath91 inspection shows that it makes contributions to the second order of the exciton total energy but not to the third one , while leaving the zeroth and first order terms .",
    "higher order contributions are interpreted as higher order corrections to the kinetic energy of the exciton @xmath76 . while the amplitude @xmath92 is to be fixed to get the correct kinetic energy @xmath93 , the pseudo - potential form is not arbitrary .",
    "it is attractive at distances @xmath94 to promote excitonic state with typical size around its bohr radius , repulsive at short distances to penalize excitonic state with small size , and exponentially small for large distances in order not to perturb the long range coulomb potential @xcite .    adding the pseudo - potential @xmath95 to the hamiltonian @xmath96 implies a significant decrease of the expected value of the exciton energy in the strong confinement regime @xmath97 , which is now only valid for @xmath98 .",
    "the excitonic energy computed in presence of the pseudo - potential gets a better fit to experimental results in this validity domain , than those calculated without this tool .",
    "nevertheless , the divergence for very small qd size still persists as a relic of the infinite potential well assumption .",

    ", it becomes possible to find the poisson equation satisfied by the potential step @xmath27 , at least in the distributions sense .",
    "the lamb shift of any quantum state of the confined particle is therefore obtained as @xmath112 more details on this calculation is given in appendix _",
    "[ appendix_b_1]_. as expected , because of the spherical symmetry of the potentials @xmath27 and @xmath101 , the lamb shift is independent of the azimuthal quantum number @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , it is _ negative _ , since , as we shall see later , the ir cut - off satisfies the constraint @xmath114 .",
    "hence , the lamb effect brings down the energy levels of the particle , instead of raising them up , as in real atoms .",
    "this is a remarkable characteristic of the lamb shift which , to the best of our knowledge , is found for the first time .    in appendix _ [ appendix_b_2 ] _ , we present an alternative calculation of this lamb shift . it is based on a regularized but non - resumed version of eq .",
    "( [ deltae_lamb ] ) , and leads to a lamb shift , identical to eq .",
    "( [ deltae^infty_lamb ] ) . despite an identical regularization method",
    ", no divergent terms appear in the limit @xmath104 , which is most satisfactory from the conceptual point of view .",
    "this corroborates the fact that such a term is not physical , when a trapped particle is confined by the infinite potential well @xmath101 .",
    "as we will see later , this property appears to be fundamental .",
    "finally , this second calculation validates the regularization of the confining potential by an intermediate finite potential step .",
    "the evaluation of the ir cut - off @xmath115 is also problematic . in the bethe approach ,",
    "the ir cut - off explicitly depends on the considered quantum state , which is not the case in the welton approach . in real atoms",
    ", it has been shown that the ir cut - off introduced by bethe in his original article is actually of about the same order of magnitude independently of the energy levels @xcite . therefore , to introduce a appropriate ir cut - off @xmath25 , independent from quantum numbers of the considered energy level , as required by the welton approach",
    ", we suggest to define it by the formal average of the quantum state dependent ir cut - offs of the bethe approach over all possible quantum numbers @xcite @xmath116 as quantum numbers are not limited from bellow , and are infinitely many , the sum of eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) is infinite . to confer a rigorous meaning to eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) , a regularization method should be prescribed .",
    "actually , the number of terms in the sum is finite , since the trapped particle , being excited through its interaction with the electromagnetic field , can have access only to a finite number of states .",
    "as the highest accessible level is limited by the finite field energy @xmath117 , there is a way to define a _ uv cut - off _",
    "@xmath118 for authorized wave numbers .",
    "in practice , we make use of the so - called feynman regularization method , presented in appendix * [ appendix_c ] * , which leads to the choice @xmath119 thus , @xmath25 is of the order of magnitude of the ground state energy of the confined particle , contrary to the case of real atoms @xcite .",

    "thus , in a _ theoretical _ qd of radius @xmath61 smaller than @xmath128 , the confined particle should acquire at least a confinement energy @xmath129 of the order of magnitude of its rest mass energy @xmath130 , which will explicitly contravene to the non - relativistic assumption .",

    "as an observable effect , the lamb shift is indeed gauge invariant .",
    "welton argument is clearly gauge invariant , since the electromagnetic field only intervenes through its energy density , a gauge invariant quantity .",
    "bethe argument depends however on the gauge , since the interaction hamiltonian @xmath133 in the pauli - fierz hamiltonian @xmath17 , used as perturbation , is written in the coulomb gauge . therefore , it is useful to check gauge invariance in calculations of the lamb shift of the energy levels for a _ theoretical _ qd . to this end , we study the lamb effect in the gauge imposed by the electric dipole approximation .    in this approximation ,",
    "the electric field spatial variation is negligible over typical particle distances  _ i.e. _ @xmath134 and the related scalar potential is @xmath135  , and that there is no magnetic field @xmath136 , hence no vector potential @xmath137 .",

    "thus , the second integral is the one which gives rise to the lamb shift in the dipole approximation .",

    "renormalization arguments of the original bethe article are used to get the corrective term @xmath142 the third term in @xmath143 is recognized as the lamb shift for a state @xmath19 , as expected from the welton approach or the bethe approach in the coulomb gauge .",
    "the second term is simply a numerical constant , which can be omitted using an additive renormalization argument .",
    "the first term is explicitly gauge dependent , since @xmath144 .",
    "so , in a general way , the lamb shift in the gauge fixed by the electric dipole approximation is identical to the one computed in the coulomb gauge .",
    "this should be explicitly verified in the case of a particle confined in the infinite potential well @xmath101 . as described in more details in appendix _",

    "( [ deltae^infty_lamb ] ) for any quantum state of the confined particle .",
    "as mentioned in subsection _ [ subsec_4_1 ] _ , this alternative calculation of its lamb shift also eliminates divergent terms in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "this reinforces once again the argument according to which the term scaling as @xmath145 , which appears in the calculation method presented in subsection _",
    "[ subsec_4_1 ] _ , is an artefact of the regularization method , and should be dropped .",
    "the observed negative sign of the lamb shift for a particle confined in a spherical potential found in subsection _ [ subsec_4_1 ] _ , as opposed to positive lamb shifts known for hydrogen - like atoms , calls for a comment .",
    "we first present a heuristic argument , and then back it up with a mathematical approach .      in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the quantized electromagnetic field",
    "is represented by an assembly of harmonic oscillators , which are known to have a non - zero ground state energy , often called the zero - point energy . even in absence of any external radiation field ,",
    "non - zero electromagnetic fields are present as arising from the zero - point energy of all the associated oscillators .",
    "the effect of these _ vacuum fluctuations _ on a charged particle is to smear out its position causing a spread of charge and mass in space , characterized by a typical radius of the order of magnitude of the deviation @xmath146 @xcite .    in hydrogen - like atoms ,",
    "the spreading effect generates a correction to the coulomb potential .",
    "the electron charge is distributed over a larger volume of space and less of its charge experience the nuclear coulomb potential , resulting in a reduction of its binding energy to the nucleus .",
    "electron @xmath147-states , being closer to the nucleus than other states , would experience a larger reduction of the binding energy .",
    "hence , the major effect of the vacuum fluctuations is to shift @xmath147-states upward in energy relative to @xmath148-states .",
    "this energy difference is predicted by qed to be of about @xmath149 mhz for the hydrogen atom 2@xmath147 state , which is the leading contribution to the observed lamb shift @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in a _ theoretical _ qd , since no force acts on the charged particle inside the qd the apart infinite wall reflection at its boundary .",
    "thus , the observed effect is not due to an electric charge spreading but to a mass spreading . in this situation , the total energy which was concentrated in the kinetic energy of the point - like particle",
    "is now transferred to the energy of a spatial mass distribution , which splits into center of mass motion and relative motion . on the basis of total energy conservation",
    ", one should expect then a _ reduction _ of the center mass motion energy , an effect which is opposite to the one observed in atoms .    among the secondary contributions to the lamb shift , it is the vacuum polarization which is of largest order .",
    "virtual pairs of electrons and positrons are continuously created and annihilated in vacuum .    inside an hydrogen - like atom ,",
    "virtual electrons are attracted to the nucleus , while positrons are repelled .",
    "the result is that the nucleus charge is screened by the virtual electrons .",
    "but , a bound electron inside the cloud of virtual electrons will experience a stronger attraction to the nucleus than predicted by the standard coulomb potential , and hence will be more tightly bound to the nucleus . since @xmath147-state electrons are closer to the nucleus than other electrons , they will experience a larger increase in binding energy , which can be evaluated by qed to be of about @xmath150 mhz for the hydrogen atom 2@xmath147 state @xcite .",
    "but , inside a qd , the charged particle appears to move in a polarized medium in the mean .",
    "thus , its motion will be kinematically enhanced , and the corresponding energy level raised a bit . in short , the lamb shift in qds is of very different nature as compared to usual lamb shift in atoms .      in the calculation of the lamb shift ,",
    "the main object is the series appearing in eq .",
    "( [ deltae_lamb ] ) , which we write for an hydrogen - like atom as @xmath151 , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the eigenfunction and the corresponding energy for a state labeled by the quantum numbers @xmath47 , @xmath154\\!]}$ ] and @xmath48\\!]}$ ] .",
