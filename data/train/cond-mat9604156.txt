    "the onset of coherence in a kondo lattice is associated with the opening of a gap in a kondo insulator .",
    "impurities can disrupt this coherence and produce midgap states . in this paper",
    "we will examine the effect of putting a kondo hole in a one - dimensional kondo insulator .",
    "a kondo hole is a nonmagnetic impurity which has a conduction orbital but no f  orbital .",
    "experimentally this is done by replacing ce or u ions with la or th ions .",
    "there is experimental evidence that these nonmagnetic impurities can behave as kondo impurities .",
    "for example , cepd@xmath1 is a good metal whose resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature as @xmath2 approaches zero .",
    "however , when nonmagnetic la ions are substituted for ce ions in ce@xmath3la@xmath4pd@xmath1 , the resistivity below 50 k increases with decreasing temperature in a fashion reminiscent of kondo impurities in a metal.@xcite    sollie and schlottmann@xcite have done calculations on a kondo hole in an anderson lattice with the energy of the f  orbital @xmath5 on the kondo hole site and a finite value of @xmath6 on the other sites .",
    "they calculate the self  energy to second order perturbation in @xmath7 about the hartree  fock solution , though they do not calculate the self  energy self  consistently and they neglect its momentum dependence . by examining the local f  electron density of states",
    ", they find midgap states in the vicinity of the hole site .",
    "however , this approach does not distinguish between the various types of gaps , e.g. , spin and charge .",
    "in this paper we use the density matrix renormalization group approach @xcite to study a kondo hole in a one dimensional kondo lattice . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first numerical calculation of a kondo hole in a kondo lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the hamiltonian , which we study using the density matrix renormalization group approach.@xcite we present our results in section iii . in section iiia , we discuss the chemical potential as a function of electron filling .",
    "we find that the impurity introduces midgap states which lie in the center of the quasiparticle gap for large values of the exchange coupling @xmath0 and move towards the edges of the gap as @xmath0 decreases . in section iiib , we present our results on the spin gap , charge gap , and neutral gap as function of @xmath0 . for small @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) , the spin gap is smaller than the charge gap , while for large @xmath0 ( @xmath9 ) , the spin gap is larger than the charge gap . in section",
    "iiic we find that the spin of the kondo hole resides primarily in the conduction spins for large @xmath0 and primarily in the f ",
    "spins for small @xmath0 . in section",
    "iiid we discuss the effect of the kondo hole on the rkky interactions . by examining the staggered susceptibility",
    ", we find that the rkky oscillations are reduced when compared to a lattice with no kondo hole .",
    "we state our conclusions in section iv .",
    "the standard one dimensional kondo lattice has spin-1/2 conduction electrons that hop from site to site with an on  site spin exchange @xmath10 between the f  electron and the conduction electron on that site . in the midst of this chain we place a kondo hole which has no f  orbital , and hence , no on  site exchange . thus the hamiltonian is @xmath11 where the conduction electron spin density on site @xmath12 is @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are pauli matrices . on the host lattice",
    "the f  electron spin density is @xmath15 , while on the kondo hole site @xmath16 because there is no f  electron .",
    "@xmath17 is the hopping matrix element for the conduction electrons between neighboring sites .",
    "we set @xmath18 .",
    "the on  site spin exchange @xmath10 is zero for the kondo hole and equal to @xmath0 on the rest of the sites .",
    "we choose @xmath0 to be antiferromagnetic ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "we place the kondo hole in the middle of the lattice on site @xmath20 , where l is the number of sites .",
    "we studied lattices of size @xmath21=4 , 6 , 8 , 16 , and 24 . in the absence of a kondo hole",
    ", the kondo insulator corresponds to half filling where the total number of conduction electrons @xmath22 equals the number of sites @xmath21 .",
    "even with a kondo hole , the hamiltonian has su(2 ) spin symmetry as well as su(2 ) charge pseudospin symmetry.@xcite the components of the pseudospin operator @xmath23 are given by : @xmath24 the z  component of the pseudospin is the charge operator and is equal to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total number of electrons including both conduction and f  electrons .",
    "an @xmath27 state can be achieved by adding two electrons .",
    "all the energy eigenstates have a definite value of s and i. at half  filling with one kondo hole ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , the ground state is a pseudospin singlet with total spin @xmath30 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "the spin gap @xmath32 is defined as the energy difference between the lowest  lying excited spin state and the ground state : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy of the ground state . for @xmath35 , the lowest spin excitation corresponds to forming a triplet between an f  spin and a conduction spin on a site that is not a kondo hole , with the remaining sites being the same as in the ground state . in this limit @xmath36 .    to find the charge gap",
    ", we note that optical experiments measure the charge gap by measuring the conductivity which is determined by the current - current correlation function .",
    "the current is related to the charge density through the continuity equation .",
    "thus the lowest lying charge excitation is the lowest excited state @xmath37 with @xmath30 such that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the q - component of the fourier transformed charge density operator and @xmath40 is the ground state.@xcite notice that @xmath39 is related to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a fourier transformed vector in pseudospin space given by @xmath43 using the wigner - eckart theorem , one can show that the ( @xmath30 , @xmath44 ) states are the only states @xmath37 for which the charge density @xmath39 has finite matrix elements @xmath45 with the ground state @xmath40 .",
    "thus the charge gap @xmath46 is the energy difference between the ground state and the lowest pseudospin triplet state:@xcite @xmath47    we also define a neutral gap @xmath48 as the energy difference between the ground state and the lowest  lying excited neutral state with the same quantum numbers as the ground state ( @xmath30 , @xmath31):@xcite @xmath49 for the half  filled kondo lattice without a kondo hole , the neutral singlet has been found to be an elementary excitation consisting of a `` particle '' and a `` hole '' , which are ( @xmath30 , @xmath50 ) excitations . in a single site basis , a `` hole '' is a site with one f ",
    "electron and no conduction electrons with quantum numbers ( @xmath30 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) ; this hole is different from a kondo hole .",
    "a `` particle '' is a site with one f ",
    "electron and two conduction electrons with ( @xmath30 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 ) . a particle and a hole can be combined to form a charge excitation ( @xmath53 , @xmath44 ) or a neutral singlet excitation ( @xmath53 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "( other combinations are also possible . )",
    "when a kondo hole is added to the lattice , one can think in terms of a hole or a particle on the kondo hole site .",
    "a hole on the kondo hole site has no conduction electrons , no f  electrons , and quantum numbers ( @xmath53 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "a particle on the kondo hole site has 2 conduction electrons , no f  electrons , and quantum numbers ( @xmath53 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 ) .",
    "a particle ( hole ) on a kondo hole site can be combined with a hole ( particle ) on an ordinary kondo site to form a charge excitation ( @xmath30 , @xmath44 ) or a neutral excitation ( @xmath30 , @xmath31).@xcite these are the excitations associated with the charge gap and the neutral gap .",
    "we use the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm @xcite to calculate the ground state and the first few excited states of the kondo lattice .",
    "this real - space technique has proven to be remarkably accurate for one dimensional systems such as the kondo and anderson lattices.@xcite we used the finite system method @xcite with open boundary conditions in which there is no hopping past the ends of the chain .",
    "we kept up to 140 states per block .",
    "the results were extremely accurate for @xmath35 , with typical truncation errors of order @xmath54 for @xmath0=10 .",
    "for @xmath55 , the f - spin degrees of freedom lead to a large number of nearly degenerate energy levels . as a result ,",
    "the accuracy was significantly reduced , with truncation errors of order @xmath56 for @xmath0=0.5 .",
    "we study how the chemical potential varies with electron filling .",
    "we consider a 16 site kondo lattice with the kondo hole on site 8 .",
    "we vary the electron filling and define the chemical potential by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the ground state energy with @xmath22 electrons .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chempot ] , where we have scaled the chemical potential by @xmath0 .",
    "when the kondo hole is absent , there is a jump in the chemical potential that is centered about half  filling ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is the quasiparticle gap which is defined as the difference of chemical potentials @xmath60 from fig .",
    "[ fig : chempot ] , we see that the kondo hole introduces states in the gap for large @xmath0 .",
    "the chemical potential of these midgap states corresponds to the energy of adding a particle or a hole to the half  filled system . to understand why these midgap states have a chemical potential so close to zero , note that for @xmath35 , an on  site spin singlet forms between the f  spin and the conduction electron spin on each host lattice site .",
    "( `` host lattice site '' refers to an ordinary kondo site which does not have a kondo hole . )",
    "when we put 0 , 1 , or 2 conduction electrons on the kondo hole site , the associated electrons or holes will be localized in the vicinity of the impurity , and the energies of these three states will be nearly degenerate .",
    "this means that the chemical potential corresponding to adding a particle or a hole to a half  filled system is close to zero .",
    "this is indeed what we see for @xmath61 .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , these midgap states move toward the edges of the gap as the associated states become less localized .",
    "we have calculated the spin , charge , and neutral gaps as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath21=8 , 16 , and 24 at half  filling ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps ] . for comparison",
    "we show the corresponding values of the gaps when there is no kondo hole . without a kondo hole",
    "the spin gap is smaller than the charge gap for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "however , when there is a kondo hole , the spin gap is larger than the charge gap for @xmath62 and smaller than the charge gap for @xmath63 . to understand this behavior ,",
    "note that when @xmath35 , we can describe the eigenstates in terms of simple on - site states .",
    "each ordinary kondo site can be in a singlet state involving the f - electron and a conduction electron with an energy of @xmath64 , a spin triplet state with energy @xmath0/4 , a `` hole '' state with no conduction electrons ( @xmath65 ) , or a `` particle '' state with two conduction electrons ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the particle and hole states have zero energy .",
    "the kondo hole can have one conduction electron ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , be in a `` hole '' state with no electrons ( @xmath53 , @xmath50 , @xmath67 ) , or be in a `` particle '' state with 2 conduction electrons ( @xmath53 , @xmath50 , @xmath68 ) .",
    "these three kondo hole states have zero energy . in the ground state , the kondo hole has one conduction electron and every site of the host lattice is a singlet when @xmath35 .",
    "the lowest spin excitation consists of a single host site with a spin triplet , with the remaining sites being in their ground state configuration ; this gives @xmath69.@xcite the lowest charge excitation ( @xmath30 , @xmath44 ) consists of a hole ( particle ) on the kondo hole site and a particle ( hole ) on a host site . since one singlet is destroyed , this results in @xmath70 .",
    "notice that these estimates indicate that the spin gap is greater than the charge gap for large @xmath0 .",
    "the low - lying eigenstates consist of linear combinations of these local excitations .",
    "these simple estimates of the gaps work very well for @xmath35 ; e.g. , for @xmath71 and @xmath72 we find numerically that @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and for @xmath61 and @xmath72 we find @xmath75 and @xmath76 .      at half  filling ( @xmath28 ) a kondo lattice with a single kondo hole has a total spin @xmath30 . when @xmath35 , the kondo hole has one conduction electron and every site of the host lattice is a singlet in the ground state .",
    "thus the spin1/2 resides in the conduction orbital of the kondo hole .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin]a where we plot the z  component of the conduction spin versus site .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases , the spin1/2 is no longer predominantly in the conduction orbitals .",
    "rather it is primarily in the f  orbitals of the sites neighboring the kondo hole . for @xmath77 , as fig .",
    "[ fig : spin]b shows , the z  component of the f  spins on the nearest neighbor sites are polarized and have most of the spin .",
    "the f  spins on neighboring sites further away from the kondo hole have rkky oscillations with an envelope that decays exponentially , indicating that the spin is localized in the f ",
    "orbitals for small @xmath0 .",
    "notice that for large @xmath0 , e.g. , @xmath61 , the spin density has very little amplitude in the f  spins .",
    "we can fit the absolute value of the z ",
    "component @xmath78 of the f  spins to the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the distance from the kondo hole and @xmath81 is the localization length . in fig .",
    "[ fig : loclength ] we plot the localization length @xmath81 versus @xmath0 .",
    "this crossover from conduction spins to f  spins as @xmath0 decreases is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossover ] where we plot the total conduction spin @xmath82 and the total f ",
    "spin @xmath83 of the lattice versus @xmath0 .",
    "the crossover occurs around @xmath84 .",
    "we can understand why this crossover occurs in the following way . as we discussed earlier , for large @xmath0",
    ", the spin is primarily in the conduction orbital of the kondo hole . for @xmath85",
    ", it is energetically favorable for both up and down spin conduction electrons to hop freely .",
    "putting the spin1/2 in the conduction spins would polarize the conduction electrons and impede the hopping of the down spin electrons .",
    "so the spin1/2 resides primarily in the f  spins . polarizing the f",
    " spins costs exchange energy but that is less important than the kinetic energy for @xmath85 . to see why the crossover occurs at @xmath84 , note that we can write the hamiltonian as @xmath86 where we sum over repeated greek indices .",
    "the hopping term and the exchange term are comparable when @xmath84 .      at zero temperature",
    "the uniform susceptibility @xmath87 is zero because there is a spin gap between the ground state and the lowest spin excitations .",
    "the ground state is an @xmath30 doublet whose energy is linear in a uniform magnetic field due to zeeman splitting .",
    "thus @xmath88 .",
    "however , the staggered susceptibility @xmath89 is finite . to calculate the susceptibility @xmath89",
    ", we apply a small staggered magnetic field @xmath90 which couples to both the f  spins and the conduction spins .",
    "the magnitude @xmath91 lies between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "when @xmath91 is this small , the plot of @xmath94 versus @xmath91 is a straight line whose slope is the susceptibility @xmath89 .",
    "( @xmath94 is the fourier transform of @xmath95 . )",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions with @xmath96 .",
    "the staggered susceptibility @xmath97 is a measure of the rkky coupling between f  spins .",
    "( @xmath98 is the fermi wavevector of the noninteracting conduction electrons . ) at half ",
    "filling @xmath99 and the rkky coupling favors antiferromagnetic alignment of the f  spins . since the kondo hole is missing an f  spin , we expect the rkky oscillations , and hence @xmath97 , to be diminished by the presence of a kondo hole .",
    "in addition the kondo hole breaks translational invariance and allows the system to respond at wavevectors other than the wavevectors of the staggered field .",
    "this will also reduce @xmath97 relative to its value in lattice without a kondo hole .    as @xmath0 approaches zero",
    ", numerical noise can induce spurious antiferromagnetic ordering of the lattice because the states with and without long range order are very close in energy .",
    "because of this , we only study short chains ( 4 and 6 sites ) which we can diagonalize exactly . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chivsj ] we plot the staggered susceptibility @xmath100 versus @xmath0 for lattices with and without a kondo hole at half ",
    "filling.@xcite as expected , our results show that the staggered susceptibility is greatly reduced by the presence of a kondo hole .",
    "this reflects the suppression of rkky oscillations .",
    "as the lattice gets longer , we expect that the effect of a single kondo hole will be diluted and @xmath89 will approach the value of a pristine lattice .",
    "we have studied a kondo hole in the middle of a one  dimensional kondo lattice at half filling using the density matrix renormalization group technique .",
    "the kondo hole introduces midgap states which move from the middle of the quasiparticle gap to the edges as the exchange coupling @xmath0 goes from large values to small values . as @xmath101",
    ", the chemical potential of these midgap states goes to zero which corresponds to the degeneracy of states with 0 , 1 , and 2 conduction electrons on the kondo hole site . at half filling there are an odd number of spins and the ground state has @xmath30 .",
    "this spin1/2 is localized in the vicinity of the kondo hole .",
    "it is primarily in the f ",
    "spins for small @xmath0 and in the conduction spins for large @xmath0 .",
    "the crossover occurs at @xmath84 where the kinetic energy is comparable to the exchange energy .",
    "we presented results on the spin gap , charge gap , and neutral gap as a function of @xmath0 . for small @xmath0",
    "the spin gap is smaller than the charge gap .",
    "however , for large @xmath0 , the spin gap is larger than the charge gap because the energy to change a singlet into a triplet is @xmath102 while the energy to transfer an electron or a hole from the kondo hole to another site which had a singlet is @xmath103 .",
    "the presence of the kondo hole reduces rkky oscillations as can be seen in the staggered susceptibility @xmath104 .",
    "putting kondo holes into kondo insulators can be done experimentally by replacing ce ions with la ions .",
    "it should be possible to look in real materials for some of the effects listed above , e.g. , midgap states and reduced rkky oscillations .",
    "however , having a finite concentration of kondo holes introduces effects that we have not considered here such as impurity bands and interactions between the kondo holes.@xcite",
