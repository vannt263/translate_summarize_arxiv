    "quark gluon plasmas ( qgps ) have been produced by high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "they have been extensively explored and shown to be thermalized@xcite in a very short period @xmath8fm / c after the collisions .",
    "the plasmas are expected to approach to the ideal gas at high temperatures @xmath9gev . in such a temperature",
    "the plasmas are composed of weakly coupled quarks and gluons . on the other hand ,",
    "the plasmas are composed of strongly coupled quarks and gluons@xcite at low temperatures , e.g. @xmath10gev . with further decrease of the temperatures ,",
    "a phase transition takes place at a critical temperature @xmath11gev and the quarks and gluons are confined in hadrons .    at high temperatures ,",
    "the weakly coupled quarks and gluons are quasi - particles in the plasmas . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clearly understood what are quasi - particles in the plasmas of the strongly coupled quarks and gluons at low temperatures , for example , at the temperature @xmath12 where coupling strength is given by @xmath13 with gauge coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "but , the number @xmath15 of quasi - particles defined such that @xmath16 with energy density @xmath17 has been shown in the lattice gauge theories@xcite to be rapidly suppressed in such strong coupled plasmas as the temperatures approach to the critical temperature @xmath18 .",
    "it has recently been proposed@xcite that quasi - particles of the strong coupled qcd plasmas are magnetic monopoles@xcite in addition to quarks and gluons . according to the model @xcite , quarks and gluons are dominant components in the plasmas at high temperature @xmath19 , while the monopoles are dominant components at low temperature @xmath12 . in other words ,",
    "the effective dynamical degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons are suppressed in the low temperature @xmath20 , and instead the monopoles become dominant . it was pointed out@xcite before the proposal@xcite that the monopoles play important roles in strongly coupled qgps with temperatures near @xmath18 .",
    "for example , they play a role of making small shear viscosity of the plasmas@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the monopoles play the role of quark confinement@xcite at the temperatures @xmath21 .",
    "the dominance of the monopoles at low temperature @xmath20 and the dominance of the quarks and gluons at high temperature @xmath19 is a characteristic feature of the model of the thermalized quark gluon monopole plasmas ( qgmps ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss prethermalized states of monopoles and gluons .",
    "they are the states produced by the decay of homogeneous color electric @xmath0 and magnetic @xmath1 fields .",
    "the presence of such classical gauge fields ( glasmas ) produced by the high energy heavy ion collisions has been discussed in a model of color glass condensate@xcite .",
    "although these monopoles and gluons interact with each other and would be thermalized after their production , the states we discuss in the paper are prethermalized states of the non - interacting gluons and monopoles . we do not address how the states are thermalized , but address which ones are dominant decay products of the gauge fields , gluons or monopoles .",
    "the field strengths of the glasmas depend on saturation momentum @xmath22 of the color glass condensate .",
    "the strong gauge fields with large @xmath22 have small gauge couplings @xmath23 , while the weak gauge fields with small @xmath22 , but still larger than @xmath24 have large gauge couplings @xmath25 .",
    "there are some reliable methods with which the decays of the strong gauge fields can be analyzed .",
    "they are classical statistical field theories@xcite , schwinger mechanism@xcite or classical numerical simulations@xcite in gauge theories of quarks and gluons .",
    "but there are no reliable methods with which the decays of the weak gauge fields can be analyzed since @xmath26 is large .",
    "we need to use some non - perturbative methods or models of strongly coupled quarks and gluons . here",
    "we use a model of dual superconductors@xcite in qcd as an effective field theoretical model of the monopoles ; they are assumed to be quasi - particles of strongly coupled gluons .",
    "the phenomenological model of the monopoles has been used for the analysis of quark confinement in qcd vacuum .",
    "it is natural to apply it to the analysis of the glasma decay which leads to strongly coupled qgps , in which perturbative analysis is not valid .",
    "the non - perturbative analysis based on the phenomenological model would be valid for example in a range @xmath27 ( or @xmath20 ) where the glasmas still hold the coherence as classical fields and the monopoles do not strongly couple with each others .",
    "we note that the gluon occupation number of the glasmas is of the order of @xmath28 and the magnetic couplings of the monopoles are also given by @xmath28 . for the analysis of the glasma decays , we use both of the model and the gauge theories of gluons in the whole range of the gauge couplings",
    "it turns out that the glasmas mainly decay into monopoles when the gauge couplings are strong such as @xmath27 , while they mainly decay into gluons when they are weak such as @xmath30 .",
    "the prethermalized states of the decay products have a similar feature to that in the qgmps mentioned above .",
    "namely , the gluons are dominant decay products of the strong gauge fields , while the monopoles are dominant ones of the weak gauge fields .",
    "thus , the temperatures of the thermalized plasmas produced by the strong gauge fields is high , while the temperatures of the thermalized plasmas produced by the weak gauge fields is low .",
    "thus , if we identify the initial values of @xmath31 or @xmath32 as a temperature , the dominant components of the prethermalized plasmas are similar to the ones in the qgmps .",
    "the identification @xmath31 or @xmath33 is suggested by the fact that the energy densities of the prethermalized gluons and monopoles are given by the initial values @xmath34 of the gauge fields , while those of the qgmps are roughly given by @xmath7 .",
    "there is a duality such that the gluons play dominant roles in the glasmas with large @xmath22 or qgp plasmas with high temperatures , while the monopoles do dominant roles in the glasmas with small @xmath22 ( but still larger than @xmath24 ) or qgp plasmas with low temperatures ( but still larger than @xmath18 ) .",
    "we assume in the present paper that the color glass condensates are still present even when @xmath22 is small just as @xmath35 and that they are described by classical color gauge fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 since the gluon occupation number is given by @xmath36 .",
    "we call such glasmas strongly coupled glasmas , while we call the glasmas with large @xmath22 weakly coupled glasmas . in the next section",
    ", we describe how the monopoles play roles in the decay of the strongly coupled glasmas . in the section [ 3 ]",
    ", we describe the applicability of our model by the use of which the productions of gluons and monopoles are discussed .",
    "actual models of gluons and monopoles are presented in section [ 4 ] .",
    "the evolution equations of the number densities of gluons and monopoles are presented in section [ 5 ] .",
    "our results are shown in the section [ 6 ] . in the final section we present our discussions and conclusion .",
    "we explain the role of the color magnetic monopoles in the decay of the glasmas .",
    "their decay has been mainly discussed using the classical statistical field theory@xcite , schwinger mechanism@xcite or classical numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "although the classical statistical field theory is well controlled method , it is only applicable to the very weakly coupled glasmas , that is , glasmas with sufficiently large saturation momenta @xmath22 for the gauge coupling to be extremely small @xmath37 .",
    "however , the theories are not applicable for the glasmas with realistic small gauge couplings @xmath38@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the schwinger mechanism is applicable even for the moderately strongly coupled glasmas .",
    "the pair creation of gluons arise according to the mechanism , which makes the color electric fields decrease .",
    "but the magnetic fields of the glasmas hardly decay in the mechanism .",
    "this is because the pair creations of gluons do not make the magnetic fields decrease .",
    "similarly , the numerical simulations using classical equations of motion are only applicable for sufficiently strong gauge fields for gluons to keep the coherence .",
    "but with the expansion of the glasmas , the coherence is not kept since the gluons become dilute .",
    "furthermore , the classical treatments including the classical statistical studies does not make clear what are quasi particles after the decay of the gauge fields . in this way , it is not efficient to apply these methods to the analysis of the decay of the strongly coupled glamsas with saturation momenta such as @xmath39",
    ".    obviously , the magnetic monopoles make the magnetic fields efficiently decay in monopole plasmas .",
    "they also play the role of confining quarks and gluons@xcite in the strongly coupled qcd vacuum .",
    "the monopoles are well defined objects in qcd when the gauge couplings are large , since the magnetic charge is so small that their mutual interactions are small .",
    "it is expected that the monopoles play important roles in the glasmas with small @xmath22 or qgps with temperatures near @xmath18 . actually , it was pointed out@xcite that the monopoles play important roles in the strongly coupled qgps with the low temperatures as well as in qcd vacuum . in particular",
    ", it has recently been discussed@xcite in the realistic analysis of high energy heavy ion collisions that they are present even at @xmath40 and play significant roles in the qgmps . in the discussions",
    "they are treated simply as point particles with magnetic charges @xmath41 satisfying the dirac quantization condition @xmath42 .",
    "but , their production mechanism in heavy ion collisions and their properties ( masses or spins ) in the thermalized states are still not well - known .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to apply a phenomenological model of the magnetic monopoles to the analysis of the decay of the strongly coupled glasmas with small @xmath22 .",
    "it is the model of the dual superconductors .",
    "it has been extensively discussed to analyze strongly coupled qcd vacuum .",
    "the model is phenomenological and our production mechanism of the monopoles is rough .",
    "but , our results are consistent with the model of the qgmps ; the monopoles is strongly suppressed in the states arising from weakly coupled glasmas ( in the qgmps with high temperatures ) , while they are dominant in the states arising from the strongly coupled glamsas ( in the qgmps with low temperatures ) .",
    "here we mention that the classical gauge fields of the glasmas are present when the gluon occupation number @xmath43 in the color glass condensates is much larger than unity .",
    "that is , the coherence of the gluons is present for @xmath44 .",
    "it is realized for large saturation momentum @xmath45 . in the range ,",
    "the classical statistical field theories are applicable to the decay of the glasmas , resulting in the gluon production .",
    "when @xmath22 becomes smaller , the coherence of the gluons gets worse .",
    "the strongly coupled glasmas we discuss are characterized by large gauge couplings , but we expect that the coherence of the gluons still holds .",
    "we may assume that the classical gauge fields of the glasmas are present even for large gauge couplings such as @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) ; the occupation number is of the order of unity for @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the phenomenological model of the monopoles , which would be valid for large gauge coupling such as @xmath49 , can be applied to the decay of the classical gauge fields of the glasmas .",
    "our production mechanism of gluons and monopoles is schwinger mechanism , that is , they are generated as pair production@xcite under the background color electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we assume that the background gauge fields are spatially homogeneous and are pointed into the identical directions , both in real and color spaces .",
    "the gauge fields decrease with the pair production of the color charged particles .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the field strength of color electric and magnetic fields are initially identical ; @xmath50 .",
    "we have a parameter @xmath51 representing the strength of the gauge fields .",
    "we should point out that the energy densities of the gluons and monopoles produced are given by @xmath52 , since the energies of the gauge fields are transformed into the energies of the particles .    as we show below , most of the gluons produced by schwinger mechanism are the ones called as nielsen - olesen unstable modes@xcite .",
    "the modes arise when classical color magnetic fields are present .",
    "their presence implies instabilities@xcite of the gauge fields and has been discussed in several numerical simulations@xcite using inhomogeneous background gauge fields .",
    "the growth rates @xmath53 of the exponentially growing unstable modes @xmath54 found in the simulations correspond to @xmath51 in the present paper , i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "that is , we describe the instabilities arising under inhomogeneous background gauge fields as instabilities arising under the homogeneous background gauge fields@xcite .",
    "the field strengths of the homogeneous gauge fields are appropriately chosen so as to give rise to the identical growth rates to the ones obtained in the numerical simulations with the inhomogeneous background gauge fields .",
    "the description using such homogeneous gauge fields may be considered as a mean field approximation for gauge fields with general inhomogeneous configurations . in general , the parameter @xmath51 is much less than real saturation momenta @xmath22 of glasmas .",
    "the calculation of the gluon production in the schwinger mechanism is only reliable in the glasmas with large @xmath51 such as @xmath56 , since the gluons must weakly interact with each other for our approximation to be valid .    when we naively apply it to the glasmas with small @xmath51 ( @xmath57 ) , we find that the electric fields decay so slowly that the gluon production hardly arise .",
    "but the application is not suitable to the glasmas .",
    "then we need to see how the electric fields decay after the rapid decay of the magnetic fields .",
    "we show in the section [ 7 ] that the energies of the electric fields dissipate in the monopole plasmas without the gluon production .",
    "thus , the result of the gluon suppression is valid .    on the other hand , we assume an effective field theoretical model of monopoles in order to calculate their productions in the schwinger mechanism .",
    "the model describes dual - superconductors@xcite in which quark confinement is realized with monopole condensations .",
    "we apply it to the analysis of the states in which gluons strongly couple with each other and the monopoles weakly couple with each other .",
    "the qgmps with low temperatures as well as the prethermalized states produced by the decay of weakly coupled glasmas with small @xmath51 would be such states .",
    "but the model is not applicable to the states with high temperatures @xmath58 or the weakly coupled glasmas with large @xmath51 , since the magnetic charge @xmath42 is large so that the monopoles strongly couple with each other . on the other hand , it is general consensus that the monopoles do not play any roles and are absent in weakly coupled qgps .",
    "our result is consistent with the qgmps ; the monopoles is strongly suppressed in the prethermalized states arising from the glasmas with large @xmath51 , while they are dominant in the prethermalized states arising from the glasmas with small @xmath51 .",
    "when we naively apply the model to the glasmas with large @xmath51 ( @xmath56 ) , we find that the magnetic fields decay so slowly that the monopole production hardly arise . but the application is not suitable to the glasmas .",
    "as we show in the section [ 7 ] , the energies of the magnetic fields dissipate in the gluon plasmas without the monopole production .",
    "thus , the result of the monopole suppression is valid .",
    "first we explain our model .",
    "we consider gluons in su(2 ) gauge theory with the background color electric and magnetic fields given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; @xmath61 .",
    "they are supposed to be spatially homogeneous and collinear both in the real and color spaces .",
    "the gauge fields are represented by the diagonal component of the gauge potential @xmath62 . under the background fields , the off - diagonal components @xmath63 perpendicular to @xmath64 behave as charged vector fields . when we represent su(2 ) gauge potentials @xmath65 using the variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 , lagrangian of su(2 ) gauge fields is written@xcite in the following ,    @xmath68    with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath66 represents both the background gauge fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the fields @xmath67 represent charged vector fields with the anomalous magnetic moment described by the term @xmath71 .",
    "they also have standard interactions with the gauge fields @xmath66 through the covariant derivative @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , it is easy to see that when the background magnetic field @xmath73 is present , the gluons represented by the fields @xmath74 occupy the landau levels and interact with each other through the term @xmath75 .",
    "the energies @xmath76 of the gluons with spin parallel to the background magnetic field are given by @xmath77 with integer @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes momentum component parallel to @xmath80 .",
    "the modes effectively have imaginary mass @xmath81 , which arises from the term of the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "thus , we find that the modes with @xmath82 are unstable when @xmath83 ; the gauge fields exponentially grow such that @xmath84 .",
    "the modes are called as nielsen - olesen unstable modes@xcite and are produced spontaneously under the magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "we can see from the exponential growth of the gauge fields @xmath85 that the modes with smaller @xmath86 are produced more abundantly .",
    "the fact indicates that the soft modes of the gluons are dominantly produced in the early stage of the glasmas decay .",
    "when the electric field @xmath0 is present , the production is accelerated owing to the schwinger mechanism . as we show later , when the background gauge fields are strong , the gluons are dominant decay products of the gauge fields .",
    "it comes from the imaginary mass @xmath81 of the gluons .    on the other hand , the energies @xmath76 of the gluons with spins anti - parallel to @xmath80",
    "are given by @xmath87 .",
    "the modes are stable and effectively have mass @xmath88 arising from the term of the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "they are produced only when the electric field is present .    since the production of the gluons and monopoles eventually makes the background gauge fields @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 vanish , the effective masses of the gluons vanish .",
    "thus , the gluons becomes massless after their production .",
    "our model of the monopoles@xcite describing dual superconducting states@xcite is given by    @xmath89    with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where the field @xmath92 represents the monopole .",
    "we denote magnetic charge @xmath42 and dual gauge potential @xmath93 .",
    "we should note that the monopoles have imaginary mass @xmath94 around the state @xmath95 .",
    "thus , the monopole field exponentially grows such that @xmath96 .",
    "it implies that the monopoles are spontaneously produced in the state @xmath95 even without color magnetic fields @xmath97 .",
    "similarly to the case of nielsen - olesen unstable modes , the monopoles with soft modes @xmath98 are dominantly produced and condense to make a confining vacuum ; @xmath99 .",
    "the state @xmath95 arises immediately just after the high energy heavy ion collisions . according to a model of color glass condensate , only longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields",
    "are generated after the collisions .",
    "it implies that there is no overall magnetic charges @xmath100 .",
    "thus we may suppose that the state @xmath95 is initially realized in the glasmas .",
    "the spontaneous production of the monopoles begins just after the collisions . when the magnetic field is present , the production of the monopoles is accelerated owing to the schwinger mechanism .",
    "furthermore , when color electric field @xmath0 is present , the monopoles occupy landau levels specified by integer @xmath78 .",
    "their energies @xmath101 are given by @xmath102 .",
    "thus , when the background electric field @xmath103 is smaller than @xmath104 , the monopoles in the lowest landau level ( @xmath105 ) are spontaneously produced .",
    "on the other hand the spontaneous production does not arise when the electric fields are strong enough such as @xmath106 .",
    "we show below with the explicit use of the parameter @xmath107gev that the large amount of the monopoles are dominantly produced by the weak gauge fields with @xmath108gev@xmath109 , while the production of the monopoles is suppressed for the strong gauge fields with @xmath110gev since the spontaneous production does not arise .",
    "we find that the values of the imaginary mass @xmath111 control the critical field strength @xmath112 beyond which the monopole production is suppressed .",
    "furthermore , we show that each of the monopoles abundantly produced has small kinetic energies @xmath113mev for very weak gauge fields such as @xmath114gev .",
    "the weaker gauge fields induce the production of much more abundant monopoles with smaller kinetic energies . that fact leads to large collision cross sections @xmath115 between monopoles since the distance @xmath116",
    "is roughly given by solving the equation such as the potential energies @xmath117 equal to the small kinetic energies of the monopoles ; @xmath118 .",
    "thus , after the decay of the magnetic fields with small @xmath51 , the electric fields would rapidly decay in the monopole plasmas because magnetic resistances ( @xmath119 ) are large for small kinetic energies of the monopoles .",
    "we now proceed to show how the number densities of the gluons and monopoles evolve with time .",
    "we first note that the color charged particles are accelerated by color electric or magnetic fields .",
    "thus , the energies of these gauge fields decrease .",
    "when the number density @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) of the gluons ( monopoles ) is given , the energies of the charged particles increasing with their acceleration in a period @xmath122 are given such that    @xmath123    ( we have neglected a term associated with polarization current@xcite , which comes from quantum production of the particles . the term has been shown much smaller than the terms in eq([2 ] ) associated with conduction currents@xcite . )",
    "the equations govern the evolution of the electric @xmath0 and magnetic @xmath1 fields as well as the number densities @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in order to solve the equations we need to know the number densities as the functions of the gauge fields ; @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the number densities of the charged particles produced by the schwinger mechanism , have been obtained numerically in the references@xcite , in which approximate formulas have also been given .",
    "we use the formulas given in the references .    before giving the number densities of the gluons and monopoles under the background gauge fields ,",
    "we notice that the number density of a charged scalar field with mass @xmath126 and charge @xmath14 produced by schwinger mechanism under the electric field @xmath0 has been given@xcite by    @xmath127    where we have taken into account the allowed range @xmath128 of the momentum @xmath79 of the produced particles after the electric field is switched on at @xmath129 .",
    "that is , the production rate of the particles is proportional to @xmath130 .",
    "the formula has been given for the particles with their momentum @xmath79 much larger than @xmath126 .",
    "furthermore , it is valid only for the electric field @xmath0 constant with time @xmath131 .",
    "hereafter , we assume the formula even for @xmath0 varying with time @xmath131 , as long as the variation is smooth . as we show below",
    ", the gauge fields smoothly decay up to a certain time @xmath132 , but decay rapidly after @xmath132 .",
    "thus , we use the formula until the rapid decay starts .",
    "we evaluate the number density @xmath120 and @xmath121 of the particles produced by the decay of the gauge fields at the time @xmath132 .",
    "when we impose a magnetic field @xmath1 in addition to the electric field @xmath0 , the number density of the particles with energies @xmath133 is given by    @xmath134    where the factor @xmath135 comes from the degeneracy of a landau level and the factor @xmath136 comes from the summation , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 denotes the landau levels .",
    "we should note that the term @xmath139 in eq([n ] ) corresponds to the term @xmath140 in eq([b ] ) .",
    "that is , the transverse components @xmath141 is replaced by @xmath142 and the transverse integral @xmath143 is replaced with the summation @xmath144 .",
    "then , after performing the summation , we obtain the factor @xmath136 . in this way",
    "we can easily obtain the formula eq([n ] ) with @xmath145 by replacing corresponding terms in eq([b ] ) with relevant ones .    using the formula",
    ", we can derive the number densities of the gluons and monopoles in terms of the background gauge fields @xmath146 and @xmath80 .",
    "only the difference between the scalar particles and the gluons ( monopoles ) lies in their masses .",
    "the gluons with spin parallel and the monopoles have imaginary masses , i.e. @xmath81 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "( the gluons with spin anti - parallel have the effective mass @xmath88 . ) then , by replacing the mass in the formula eq([n ] ) with the relevant ones , we obtain    @xmath147    where the first term with @xmath148 in @xmath120 represents the contribution of the gluons with spin parallel ( nielsen - olesen unstable modes ) , while the second term with @xmath149 does the one of the gluons with spin anti - parallel . these formlas have been explicitly obtained@xcite in canonical formalism , in which the gluons and monopoles with imaginary masses @xmath150 become real particles when the squares of the energies @xmath151 are positive with large @xmath152 or @xmath153 .",

    "it is easy to see from the formulas that the gluons are dominant decay products when the initial values @xmath157 of @xmath158 and @xmath159 are larger than @xmath104 , while the monopoles are dominant ones when the initial values of @xmath158 and @xmath159 are smaller than @xmath104 .",
    "this is because the gluon production is accelerated by the decrease of @xmath159 according to the factor @xmath160 in @xmath120 , while the monopole production is done by the decrease of @xmath158 according to the factor @xmath161 in @xmath121 .",
    "the gluon ( monopole ) production makes the electric field @xmath159 ( magnetic field @xmath158 ) decrease .    using the number densities eq([nn ] ) and the equation ( [ 2 ] ) , we find the evolution equations of @xmath159 and @xmath158 ,    @xmath162    with @xmath163 .",
    "we solve the equations with the initial conditions @xmath164 .",
    "these are equations governing the production of the gluons and monopoles and the decay of the background gauge fields .",

    "we find that the gluons are dominant decay products of the strong gauge fields with @xmath199gev@xmath206 , while the monopoles are dominant ones of the weak gauge fields with @xmath201gev@xmath207 .",
    "the dominance of the gluons ( monopoles ) comes from the factor @xmath160 in @xmath120 ( @xmath161 in @xmath121 ) when @xmath159 ( @xmath158 ) decreases with the production of the gluons ( monopoles ) .",
    "these features shown in fig.1@xmath208fig.3 are the very similar to those of the qgmps recently proposed @xcite if we identify @xmath51 as temperatures @xmath209 , although the decay products do not interact with each other and are never thermalized in our discussions .",
    "there are no affirmative reasons for the identification @xmath210 .",
    "but we would like to point out that the energy density of the gluons and monopoles is given by @xmath52 , while the energy density of thermalized massless particles is given by @xmath211 ; @xmath15 denotes the number of the species of the massless particles .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable to adopt the identification @xmath212 .    using these results",

    "but we note that @xmath51 must be larger than @xmath24 or @xmath18 .",
    "thus we can not take the limit @xmath218 .",
    "thus , we wish to see how small the kinetic energies of the monopoles are . for the purpose",
    ", we use the formulas @xmath121 in eq([n ] ) even with small @xmath79 , although the formulas are only valid for the large momentum @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "we show in fig.3 an average kinetic energy of a monopole given by @xmath221 where @xmath132 denotes a time at which the densities @xmath121 have been evaluated .",
    "the energy is the one acquired by a monopole as a result of the acceleration by the magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "we find that @xmath217 is approximately ten times smaller than @xmath51 for small @xmath51 .",
    "as we show below , the small kinetic energy of the monopoles causes large magnetic resistance of the monopole plasmas .",

    "when large @xmath222gev , the electric field fast decays while the magnetic field slowly decays . on the other hand ,",
    "when small @xmath201gev , the magnetic field fast decays while the electric field slowly decays .",

    "finally , we show in fig.7 how the magnetic field @xmath1 decays after the electric field @xmath0 vanishes when @xmath226gev .",
    "obviously , the decay proceeds very slowly compared with the decay of the electric field shown in fig.4 .",
    "similarly we can show that the magnetic fields rapidly decay at first and then the electric fields slowly decay when @xmath227gev . as we have stated before ,",
    "the slow decays of the remaining gauge fields are not correct because the models of the gauge fields are not applicable to their decays .",
    "namely , the decay of the magnetic fields with large @xmath51 or small @xmath228 can not be discussed in the model of dual superconductors where the monopoles strongly interact with each other .",
    "similarly , the decay of the electric fields with small @xmath51 or @xmath57 can not be discussed in the perturbative model of the gluons .",
    "we show in the next section that the remaining gauge fields rapidly vanish owing to the dissipation of their energies in the background gluon or monopole plasmas which are produced at first in the schwinger mechanism .",
    "thus , their decays do not change the result that the gluons are dominant decay products of the weakly coupled glasmas and the monopoles are dominant ones in the strongly coupled glasmas .",
    "we have used the parameter @xmath107gev in the calculation .",
    "physical quantities such as @xmath120 or @xmath121 depend on @xmath111 .",
    "when we use different values @xmath111 , the whole behaviors of @xmath197 and @xmath200 in @xmath51 do not change .",
    "but the point @xmath229 at which @xmath230 is equal to @xmath231 is different .",
    "for example , when @xmath111 becomes larger than @xmath107gev , @xmath229 becomes larger than @xmath232 .",
    "namely , the monopole dominance over the gluons arises at larger @xmath51 than @xmath233gev shown in fig.2 .",
    "the large imaginary mass of the monopoles enhances the spontaneous production of the monopoles owing to the factor @xmath234 in @xmath121 .    in our previous paper@xcite",
    "we have discussed the decay of the gauge fields based on the classical statistical field theory , where we have used the values @xmath235gev and @xmath236gev . we have found that the magnetic fields vanish in a very short time @xmath237fm / c , while the electric fields decay very slowly .",
    "these results are consistent with the present analysis .",
    "we have shown that when @xmath51 is large such as @xmath199gev , the color electric fields rapidly decay into the gluons at first and then , the remaining color magnetic fields slowly decay into the monopoles .",
    "but , the decay mechanism of the magnetic fields is not reliable for strong magnetic fields with large @xmath51 ( in other words , large @xmath41 ) . here , we would like to discuss how the remaining magnetic fields rapidly decay without the monopole production .",
    "as we show below , the gluon plasmas produced by the decay of the electric fields have color electrical conductivities @xmath238 proportional to @xmath51 for large @xmath51 . then , the magnetic fields @xmath1 vanish in the plasmas within a time of the order of @xmath239 according to the ampere s law @xmath240 , since they typically possess the momenta @xmath51 in reality , @xmath241 .",
    "( although we have assumed the spatial homogeneity of @xmath1 , it typically has momenta of the order of @xmath51 or @xmath22 . )",
    "therefore , the magnetic fields rapidly decay for large @xmath51 without the monopole production after the electric fields decay",
    ". the fact does not change our result that the gluons are dominant decay products of the weakly coupled glasmas with large @xmath51 .",
    "we explain that the conductivities are of the order of @xmath51 for large @xmath51 .",
    "the conductivities are roughly given by @xmath242 where @xmath17 denotes an average kinetic energy of a gluon and @xmath243 does mean free time of gluons .",
    "@xmath243 is defined by @xmath244 with mean free path @xmath116 and velocity @xmath245 of gluons . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean free path @xmath116 is obtained in terms of the collision cross section @xmath246 of the gluons such as @xmath247 where @xmath248 is determined by equating the potential energy @xmath249 with the kinetic energy @xmath215 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath250 is of the order of @xmath251 and @xmath252 since @xmath253 and @xmath254 for large @xmath51 as we have shown in fig.1 .",
    "( here we note the energy conservation @xmath255 . )",
    "therefore , we find that @xmath238 is of the order of @xmath51 for large @xmath51 .    on the other hand , we have shown that when @xmath51 is small but larger than @xmath24 , the magnetic fields rapidly decay into the monopoles at first and then , the electric fields slowly decay into the gluons . but",
    "the decay mechanism of the electric fields is not reliable for the weak electric fields with small @xmath51 ( in other words , large @xmath14 ) .",
    "we would like to discuss that the electric fields rapidly vanish without the gluon production .",
    "they would decay owing to the large magnetic resistance of the monopole plasmas , in other words , small magnetic conductance @xmath256 .",
    "namely , the monopoles produced by the decay of the magnetic fields have smaller kinetic energies as @xmath51 becomes smaller",
    ". then the collision cross section @xmath246 among the monopoles becomes larger as @xmath51 becomes smaller .",
    "that is , the cross section is determined by solving the equation such as the potential energy @xmath257 equal to the kinetic energy @xmath217 .",
    "thus , @xmath258 .",
    "this implies that the monopole plasmas have small magnetic conductance for small @xmath51 .",
    "actually , the magnetic conductance @xmath256 is given by @xmath259 where we assume @xmath260 with the mass @xmath261 and velocity @xmath262 of the monopoles . although the mass of the monopoles is imaginary when they are produced , the monopoles would acquire real mass @xmath261 after their production .",
    "thus , the decay time @xmath263 of the electric fields is approximately estimated such that @xmath264fm / c when @xmath265gev , @xmath266gev , @xmath267gev and @xmath268 .",
    "although the mass @xmath261 of the monopoles after their productions is unknown and the estimation is rough , our result indicates that the electric fields rapidly decay in the monopole plasmas .",
    "therefore , the monopoles are dominant decay products of the weakly coupled glasmas with small @xmath51 , since the decay of the electric fields does not produce the gluons .",
    "we have shown that the dominant decay products are gluons when large @xmath269gev , while they are monopoles when small @xmath270 .",
    "these dominant decay products remain the main components after their thermalization as proposed in the model of qgmps .",
    "the dominant decay products is determined by the comparison between the production rate @xmath271 in eq([nn ] ) of nielsen - olesen unstable modes and the rate @xmath272 in eq([nn ] ) of monopoles with imaginary mass . when the initial values @xmath50 are larger than @xmath273 , the nielsen - olesen unstable modes are dominantly produced in the initial stage of the production .",
    "then , @xmath159 decreases faster than @xmath158 , which accelerates the production of the unstable modes .",
    "thus , the dominant products are gluons when large @xmath51 . on the other hand , when the initial values @xmath50 are smaller than @xmath273 , the monopoles are dominantly produced .",
    "then , @xmath158 decreases faster than @xmath159 , which accelerates the production of the monopoles .",
    "this is our production mechanism of the dominant particles .",
    "although we have not quantitatively discussed the momentum distribution of the prethermalized gluons and monopoles , we can qualitatively discuss the dominance of the soft gluons with @xmath274 produced in the decay of the glasmas with large @xmath51 .",
    "this is because the nielsen - olesen modes with smaller longitudinal momentum @xmath275 , which grow as @xmath276 , are produced more abundantly and their typical transverse momentum @xmath277 vanish as @xmath158 vanishes with the dissipation in the gluon gas .",
    "we should remember that the fields of the modes are given such that @xmath278 with the transverse coordinates @xmath279 .",
    "therefore , we find that the gluons are mainly composed of soft modes after the decay of the glasmas .",
    "similarly , the soft modes of the monopoles are dominantly produced in the decay of the glasmas with small @xmath51 .",
    "( as a result , the monopole condensation may arise since the soft modes with almost zero momentum are mainly produced in the limit @xmath280 as numerically shown in eq([6 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the quark confinement . )",
    "the result of the soft gluon production is consistent with the previous studies@xcite using classical statistical lattice simulations .",
    "it has recently discussed@xcite by using classical statistical simulations that the topological transition associated with the chern - simons number @xmath281 is enhanced in the early stage of the weakly coupled glasma evolution .",
    "that is , the number @xmath281 rapidly increases ( or decreases ) in the stage .",
    "since @xmath282 is proportional to @xmath283 , it is easy to see in our analysis that the rapid decay of the electric fields leads to the rapid change of the number @xmath281 .",
    "similarly , we can show that the rapid topological transition may arise in the early stage of the strongly coupled glasma evolution in which the magnetic fields rapidly decay . in this way we can understand the result of the elaborate numerical simulations@xcite simply by using the schwinger mechanism .    using the model of the dual superconductors of the monopoles",
    ", we have shown that the gluons are dominant decay products of the weakly coupled glasmas with large @xmath51 , while the monopoles are dominant ones of the strongly coupled glasmas with small @xmath51 .",
    "although our evolution equations of @xmath120 and @xmath121 is very rough , the roles of the monopoles in the strongly coupled qcd physics is clarified .",
    "our results support the significance@xcite of the monopoles in the strongly coupled qgps .",
    "more rigorous treatment of the monopoles in these strongly coupled qcd physics with low temperatures @xmath40 or small saturation momenta @xmath284 is needed to confirm their roles mentioned above .",
