    "genetic networks are interacting , many - component systems of genes , rna and proteins , that control the functions of living cells @xcite .",
    "they exhibit complex , nonlinear behaviour due to the feedback between the expression of different genes . at a simplistic level of description",
    "the gene sequence , through transcription by rna and translation by mrna , leads to the production of proteins .",
    "these proteins may themselves act as transcription factors which may switch on or off the activity of other genes @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple example of a genetic network is a toggle switch formed from pairs of genes that mutually repress each other s expressions @xcite .",
    "such switches serve as microscopic models for bistable and oscillatory states @xcite and importantly may be synthesized @xcite .",
    "genetic switches may exhibit bistability where there are two possible dynamically stable long - lived states for the switch .",
    "there has been considerable interest in how bistability may be maintained and how it is effected by stochastic fluctuations due to small numbers of proteins and intrinsic noise @xcite .",
    "in particular the switching time between the two states has been measured and numerical techniques have been devised to study the switching time within theoretical models @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest toggle switch introduced by warren and p.r .",
    "ten wolde @xcite which we will refer to as the exclusive switch ( this model is referred to in @xcite as the exclusive switch without cooperative binding ) .",
    "the model comprises two genes labelled 1,2 each leading to the production of proteins @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these proteins also degrade stochastically .",
    "there is a single mutual binding site to which either an @xmath0 or @xmath1 may bind and when bound repress the production of the other protein .",
    "thus when an @xmath0 is bound , the @xmath0 population fluctuates around some steady state value determined by the balance of production and degradation while the @xmath1 population degrades towards zero .",
    "this switch may be considered more generally as a minimal model for the power struggle between two competing parties .",
    "this is illustrated by the following charicature of `` mob dynamics '' .",
    "there are two competing parties or gangs of individuals and room for only one individual to wield absolute power .",
    "when an individual of one party is in power his own party membership may grow but the other party membership dwindles .",
    "random influences imply that the control of power is occasionally lost and power may be seized by any individual . thus in a temporary power vacuum",
    "the membership of the minority party will increase and there is a small chance that a member of this party will seize power and that the minority will eventually become the majority .    in the context of statistical physics",
    "the exclusive switch is an example of a nonequilibrium system .",
    "this is because the microscopic stochastic dynamics do not obey detailed balance .",
    "for example when an @xmath0 protein is bound the degradation of an @xmath1 protein is irreversible .",
    "the structure of nonequlibrium stationary states has been of considerable interest and is generally characterised by the existence of probability currents in the stationary state ( which do not exist in equilibrium stationary states due to the presence of detailed balance)@xcite . for example it has been shown that spontaneous symmetry breaking may occur in non - equilibrium systems under conditions where it is precluded from their equilibrium counterparts e.g. in one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "the bistability exhibited in the exclusive switch may be thought of as symmetry breaking where although the microscopic dynamics is symmetric between the two proteins , the stationary state comprises two possible long - lived dynamical states in which the symmetry is broken and one protein dominates . in an equilibrium system the switching time between the two symmetry - broken states may be estimated by the arrhenius law @xmath2 where the free energy barrier @xmath3 is extensive in the system size . for a nonequilibrium system on the other hand the free energy or indeed the stationary state",
    "is not known a priori and one is required to construct the stationary state on a model by model basis . for genetic switches",
    "there has been recent interest in developing analytical approaches to describe the stationary states @xcite .    in the present work we study analytically the nonequilibrium stationary state of the exclusive switch .",
    "previous analytical studies have concentrated on systems with only one gene @xcite .",
    "our aim is to understand whether symmetry breaking occurs and , if so , the nature of the symmetry broken state . to this end",
    "we develop two analytical approaches .",
    "first we construct a mean field theory .",
    "then we develop a perturbative approach that in principle allows the nonequilibrium stationary state to be computed exactly and we present analytical results to first order .",
    "a complementary approach to this system has been developed in @xcite , where an approximation scheme based on effective interactions is used .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the exclusive switch model and write down the system of master equations that describe the system .",
    "we also present some numerical simulations which illustrate the nature of the symmetry breaking and consider exactly solvable limits . in section 3 we present a mean field theory and compare to stochastic simulations . in section 4 we develop a perturbative approach , compute the results to first order and compare with simulation results .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "the state of the system is defined by : the number of free proteins of type 1 , @xmath4 ; the number of free proteins of type 2 , @xmath5 , and the state of the switch , @xmath6 , which takes value 0 if no protein is bound , value 1 if a protein of type 1 is bound , and value 2 if a protein of type 2 is bound .",
    "the stochastic dynamical processes are as follows : a protein degrades ( leaves the system ) with rate @xmath7 ; when the switch state is 0 proteins of both type 1 and 2 are produced with rate @xmath8 ; when the switch state is 1 proteins of type 1 produced with rate @xmath8 and when the switch state is 2 proteins of type 2 produced with rate @xmath8 ; if the switch state is 0 a protein binds with rate @xmath9 and when binding occurs the switch state changes to the type of bound protein and the number of free proteins is reduced by 1 ; a bound protein unbinds with rate @xmath10 and when unbinding occurs the switch state changes to 0 and the number of free proteins is increased by 1 .",
    "we shall consider the joint probabilities @xmath11 of the protein numbers @xmath4 , @xmath5 , switch state @xmath6 .      following the stochastic dynamical processes described above the system of master equations that defines the model can be written as follows @xmath12\\nonumber \\\\",

    "the whole problem is clearly symmetric with respect to the variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "also note that , the degeneration term is the same for the three equations , since it does not depend on the value of @xmath6 .      in order to illustrate the qualitative behaviour , we first present stochastic simulations of the exclusive switch .",
    "these simulations are performed with a gillespie algorithm @xcite , in which the reactions described in the model are given a certain probability , depending on the state of the system and the value of the parameters .",
    "these probabilities are used to determine stochastically which reaction is going to happen next , and when it will happen .",
    "the time that the system spends in a given state @xmath15 is normalized to obtain the probability distributions .",
    "the reference values for the simulations are the typical values for bacteria such as escherichia coli @xcite @xmath16    in the system there is a clear symmetry between the two proteins species , since they undergo the same microscopic reactions . however , at any given time the system is typically dominated by one of the proteins ; thus the symmetry is broken .",
    "the reason for this is that , once a protein , e.g. of type @xmath0 , binds to the promoter site , proteins @xmath1 start disappearing , while the number of @xmath0 fluctuates around a steady value .",
    "that means that when the bound protein unbinds ( as it will do eventually due to stochasticity of the system ) , it is much more probable for proteins @xmath0 to bind to the promoter site again , since there are more of them . at the same time it is more difficult for proteins @xmath1 to bind to the promoter site .",
    "however the @xmath1 will not disappear permanently from the system ( there is no absorbing state ) , and will be produced again the moment the bound protein @xmath0 unbinds .",
    "thus , with a small probability , proteins @xmath1 will be able to bind again to the promoter site , and become the dominant species , as proteins @xmath0 start to degenerate .",
    "this means that there are two symmetry - broken states , in which one species is much more abundant than the other .    with regard to the probability distribution @xmath17",
    ", this bistability is translated into two peaks , concentrated around the axes , i.e , where one of the protein numbers is almost zero .",
    "this is illustrated in a contour plot in figure [ fig : contour ] for @xmath18 .",
    "however , this bistability depends strongly on the value of the parameters : the bigger the value of @xmath10 , the more irrelevant is the switch state for the dynamics of the protein , and the less important is the bistability we have described .",
    "for example in figure [ fig : contour ] , when @xmath8,@xmath9 and @xmath7 are kept constant and @xmath10 is increased , the peaks move together and eventually merge at some value of @xmath19 .",
    "thus there is an apparent transition from a distribution with two symmetry - related peaks to a distribution with one symmetric peak .",
    "we wish to study the nature of this transition i.e. is there an underlying phase transition at a finite value of @xmath10 where the system changes from symmetry - broken behaviour to symmetric behaviour , or is the transition simply due to two peaks coming closer together and no longer being resolved ?",
    "the latter would correspond to a ` geometrical transition ' in the form of @xmath17 but would not correspond to any underlying phase transition .",

    "we conclude that ( at least for these parameter values ) @xmath35 remains asymmetric for @xmath36 , and as a consequence so does @xmath22 , and there is no transition to a symmetric state in this marginal distribution .",
    "as figure [ fig : p1dis ] shows , @xmath21 has only one peak for different values of @xmath10 , and even if it becomes smaller as @xmath10 increases , it does not become symmetric at any point .",
    "we deduce that , even though @xmath17 appears to become symmetric at some finite value of @xmath10 ( see figure [ fig : contour ] ) , there is no true phase transition between symmetric and asymmetric regimes , since @xmath21 and @xmath22 always remain asymmetric .",

    "it might be that the green functions we have computed in section 4 contain some useful dynamical information .",
    "the techniques that we have developed should be applicable to the understanding of other related systems and properties of genetic switches in general .",
    "the factorisation of the moment equation hierarchy is straightforward to implement to obtain a mean field theory ; the exact perturbative approach is more involved but can be used in general for problems with similar probability distributions , as long as the green functions are analytically solvable .",

    "according to @xcite , there is a way to solve , or at least simplify , a system of linear first - order partial differential equations .",
    "first of all , considering a three dimensional space with a vector @xmath244 for the three probabilites , the system has to be written as:@xmath245where @xmath118,@xmath169 and @xmath246 are @xmath247 matrices , and @xmath248 and @xmath249 are column matrices . the requirement to solve",
    "the system is that @xmath250 or @xmath251 .    in this case",
    "the expression of the matrices is : @xmath252 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & -[g(z_2 - 1)-u]\\\\ \\end{array } \\right)\\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ d(z_1,z_2 ) = \\left ( \\begin{array}{c }   0\\\\   0\\\\0 \\end{array } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is not the most general system that could be written with this notation , since the matrix @xmath248 is zero , and @xmath118 and @xmath169 only depend on @xmath173 , @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the requirement to solve the system is that @xmath250 or @xmath251 , which is fulfilled almost in every point .",
    "multiplying by the matrix @xmath253 , the matrix @xmath118 is transformed into : @xmath254}{d(1-z_2)(d-(d+b)z_2 ) } & 0 & \\frac{(1-z_1)}{1-z_2}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ) \\\\   \\end{eqalign}\\ ] ] whose eigenvalues , written as columns in a matrix @xmath255 are : @xmath256 this hyperbolic system can be transformed with elementary matrix operations : @xmath257 the method then states that the components of @xmath170 obey the following system of equations : @xmath258 where @xmath259 are the components of the matrix @xmath260 once we have performed the transformation with @xmath255 : @xmath261 .",
    "as can be seen from the last equation , we have uncoupled the derivative terms and , even if this system can not be solved analytically , it is easier to deal with it computationally .",
    "the problem itself can be written as : @xmath262v_0 + \\left[\\frac{uz_1(z_1 - 1)}{d(z_1-z_2)(z_2 - 1)}\\right]v_1\\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\left[\\frac{-dg(z_1 - 1)^2+b[d-(g+u)z_1+gz_1z_2]}{d(z_2 - 1)[d(z_1 - 1)+bz_1]}\\right]v_2\\nonumber \\\\on & & \\quad \\frac{dz_1}{dz_2}=\\frac{1-z_1}{1-z_2}\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dv_1}{dz_2 } & = & \\left[\\frac{uz_2}{d(z_2-z_1)}\\right]v_0+\\left[\\frac{(z_1 - 1)[-gz_1+(g+u)z_2]}{d(z_2-z_1)(z_2 - 1)}\\right]v_1\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left[\\frac{dg(z_2 - 1)^2+b[-d+(g+u)z_2-gz_1z_2]}{d(z_2 - 1)[d(z_1 - 1)+bz_1]}\\right]v_2\\nonumber \\\\ on & & \\quad \\frac{dz_1}{dz_2}=\\frac{1-z_1}{1-z_2}\\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{dv_2}{dz_2 } & = & \\left[\\frac{uz_1}{d(z_2-z_1)}+\\frac{u}{d-(d+b)z_2}\\right]v_0+\\left[\\frac{uz_1[d(z_1 - 1)+bz_1]}{d(z_1-z_2)(d-(b+d)z_2)}\\right]v_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left[\\frac{-u+g(z_1+z_2 - 2)}{d(z_2 - 1)[d(z_2 - 1)+bz_2]}\\right]v_2 \\nonumber \\\\ on & & \\quad \\frac{dz_1}{dz_2}=\\frac{d-(d+b)z_1}{d-(d+b)z_2 }   \\label{exactsol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although this method in principle solves exactly the system of partial differential equations it appears a formidable task to actually integrate equations ( [ exactsol ] ) .",
    "in this appendix we give the detailed derivation of ( [ p01res ] ) .",
    "we begin from ( [ p01int ] ) @xmath263 where the label _ symm _ refers to the fact that there will be another term equal to the written one , apart from a switch in the variables @xmath218 and @xmath219 .      separating the parts of the expression that can be summed ,",
    "the following simplification can be obtained by changing the order of the sums appropriately : @xmath266 where @xmath267 .",
    "note that this sum could be simplified further , but that the simplification will not allow us to perform the integration over @xmath170 in closed form . in this and following equation ,",
    "we will try to obtain the simplest expressions globally , knowing that simplifying one part can lead to further complications in another ."
