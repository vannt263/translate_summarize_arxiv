    "a good understanding of the antikaon spectral function in nuclear matter is required for the description of @xmath3-atoms @xcite and the subthreshold production of kaons in heavy ion reactions @xcite .",
    "an exciting consequence of a significantly reduced effective @xmath3 mass could be that kaons condense in the interior of neutron stars @xcite . the ultimate goal is to relate the in - medium spectral function of kaons with the anticipated chiral symmetry restoration at high baryon density . to unravel quantitative constraints on the kaon spectral functions from subthreshold kaon production data of heavy - ion reactions requires transport model calculations which are performed extensively by various groups @xcite . the next generation of transport codes which are able to incorporate more consistently particles with finite width are being developed @xcite .",
    "this is of considerable importance when dealing with antikaons which are poorly described by a quasi - particle ansatz @xcite .",
    "there has been much theoretical effort to access the properties of kaons in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "an antikaon spectral function with support at energies smaller than the free - space kaon mass was already anticipated in the 70 s by the many k - matrix analyses of the antikaon - nucleon scattering process ( see e.g. @xcite ) which predicted considerable attraction in the subthreshold scattering amplitudes .",
    "this leads in conjunction with the low - density theorem @xcite to an attractive antikaon spectral function in nuclear matter .",
    "nevertheless , the quantitative evaluation of the antikaon spectral function is still an outstanding problem .",
    "the challenge is first to develop an improved understanding of the vacuum antikaon - nucleon scattering process , in particular reliable subthreshold antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes are required , and secondly , to evaluate the antikaon spectral function in an improved many - body treatment .",
    "the antikaon - nucleon scattering is complicated due to the open inelastic @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels and the presence of the s - wave @xmath0 and p - wave @xmath6 resonances just below and the d - wave @xmath2 resonance not too far above the antikaon - nucleon threshold .",
    "since the low - energy data on antikaon - nucleon scattering are not too precise the required subthreshold extrapolation is favorably performed imposing constraints from causality , covariance and chiral symmetry .",
    "first intriguing works in this direction can be found in @xcite where the low - energy antikaon - proton scattering data were successfully described in terms of s - wave coupled su(3 ) channels .",
    "these works are based on a cutoff regularized lippmann - schwinger equation where the potential is matched phenomenologically with the leading tree - level terms of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the fact that the subthreshold amplitudes of @xcite and @xcite differ significantly triggered the recent work @xcite which systematically considers s- , p- , and d - waves .",
    "the @xmath7-bs(3 ) approach of @xcite constitutes a considerably improved chiral scheme more consistent with covariance , crossing symmetry and the chiral counting concept .",
    "the amplitudes obtained in that scheme are particularly well suited for an application to the nuclear kaon dynamics , because it was demonstrated that they are approximately crossing symmetric in the sense that the @xmath8 and @xmath9 amplitudes smoothly match at subthreshold energies .",
    "therefore we believe that those amplitudes , which are of central importance for the nuclear kaon dynamics , will lead to rather reliable results for the propagation properties of kaons in dense nuclear matter .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite the realistic evaluation of the antikaon self energy in nuclear matter requires a self consistent scheme .",
    "in particular the feedback effect of an in - medium modified antikaon spectral function on the antikaon - nucleon scattering process was found to be important for the @xmath0 resonance structure in nuclear matter . in this work",
    "we apply the newly developed @xmath7-bs(3 ) approach of @xcite to antikaon propagation in nuclear matter in a self consistent manner .",
    "we develop a novel , maximally scheme - independent and covariant framework in which self consistency is implemented in terms of the vacuum meson - nucleon scattering amplitudes .",
    "our scheme considers for the first time the in - medium mixing of s- , p- and d - waves . besides deriving a realistic antikaon spectral function",
    "we obtain the first quantitative results on the in - medium structure of the p - wave @xmath1 and the d - wave @xmath2 resonances .",
    "in this section we introduce the self consistent and relativistic many - body framework required for the evaluation of the antikaon propagation in nuclear matter .",
    "first we recall the vacuum on - shell antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath10 where @xmath11 guarantees energy - momentum conservation and @xmath12 is the nucleon isospin - doublet spinor .",
    "note also @xmath13 .",
    "the vacuum scattering amplitude is decomposed into its isospin channels @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the initial and final kaon and nucleon 4-momenta and @xmath16 in quantum field theory the scattering amplitudes @xmath17 follow as the solution of the bethe - salpeter matrix equation @xmath18 in terms of the bethe - salpeter kernel @xmath19 , the free space nucleon propagator @xmath20 and kaon propagator @xmath21 .",
    "following @xcite we neglect here self energy corrections in the nucleon and kaon propagators . in a chiral scheme",
    "such effects are of subleading order . the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bs - eq ] ) implements properly lorentz invariance and unitarity for the two - body scattering process .",
    "the generalization of ( [ bs - eq ] ) to a coupled - channel system is straightforward .",
    "the antikaon - nucleon scattering process is readily generalized from the vacuum to the nuclear matter case . in compact notation",
    "we write @xmath22 where the in - medium scattering amplitude @xmath23 and the two - particle propagator @xmath24 depend now on the 4-velocity @xmath25 characterizing the nuclear matter frame .",
    "for nuclear matter moving with a velocity @xmath26 one has @xmath27 we emphasize that ( [ hatt ] ) is properly defined from a feynman diagrammatic point of view even in the case where the in - medium scattering process is no longer well defined due to a broad antikaon spectral function . in this work",
    "we do not consider medium modifications of the interaction kernel , i.e. we approximate @xmath28 .",
    "we exclusively study the effect of a in - medium modified two - particle propagator @xmath29 @xmath30 where the fermi momentum @xmath31 parameterizes the nucleon density @xmath32 with @xmath33 in the rest frame of the bulk with @xmath34 one recovers with ( [ rho - u ] ) the standard result @xmath35 . in this work",
    "we also refrain from including nucleonic correlation effects .",
    "such effects have been estimated to be small at moderate densities @xcite but should nevertheless be subject of a more complete consideration .",
    "the antikaon self energy @xmath36 is evaluated self consistently in terms of the in - medium scattering amplitudes @xmath37 @xmath38 in order to solve the self consistent set of equations ( [ hatt],[hatg],[k - self ] ) it is convenient to rewrite the scattering amplitude as follows @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the vacuum scattering amplitude .",
    "the idea is to start with a set of tabulated coupled - channel scattering amplitudes @xmath41 in terms of which self consistency is implemented .",
    "thus the vacuum interaction kernel @xmath42 need not to be specified .    coupled channel effects , which are known to be important for @xmath9-scattering , are included by assigning @xmath43 , @xmath29 and @xmath42 the appropriate matrix structures . here",
    "we use the convention of @xcite .",
    "for example the isospin zero loop matrix @xmath44 reads @xmath45 in this work we consider exclusively the effect of the in - medium modified @xmath9 channel .",
    "ultimately it would be desirable to include also the effects of the in - medium modified @xmath4 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 channels .",
    "since this requires a realistic in - medium pion propagator to be determined also by a self consistent scheme @xcite , we will consider such effects in a separate work .",
    "here we approximate @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "since the @xmath50 spectral density is affected only moderately by a nuclear environment we assume @xmath51 also . with these assumptions",
    "the coupled - channel problem reduces to a single channel problem if rewritten in terms of the vacuum @xmath9 amplitude @xmath52 : @xmath53 we point out that the self consistent set of equations ( [ hatg],[k - self],[rewrite : b ] ) is now completely determined by the vacuum amplitudes @xmath54 . note that even though our antikaon spectral function is a functional of the elastic @xmath55 scattering process only , the inelastic channels @xmath56 are nevertheless affected by @xmath57 .",
    "we find : @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "in ( [ inelastic ] ) we derived the effect of @xmath57 on the reaction @xmath60 with @xmath61 .    in the following section",
    "we will outline how to solve the self consistent set of equations ( [ hatg],[k - self],[rewrite : b ] ) by introducing an appropriate projector algebra .",
    "our scheme takes into account the medium induced mixing of partial waves usually neglected in conventional g - matrix calculations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we proceed by briefly recalling the coupled - channel theory of @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitudes were obtained in a relativistic chiral @xmath62 approach which includes s- , p- and d - waves systematically .",
    "the parameters were successfully adjusted to reproduce the low - energy pion - nucleon and @xmath63-proton scattering data .",
    "the scattering amplitudes were decomposed systematically into covariant projectors @xmath64 with good angular momentum @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the representation ( [ t - vacuum ] ) implies a particular off - shell behavior of the scattering amplitude , which was optimized as to simplify the task of solving the covariant bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "this is legitimate because the off - shell structure of the scattering amplitude is not determined by the two - body scattering processes in any case and moreover reflects the choice of meson and baryon interpolation fields only @xcite .",
    "the leading projectors relevant for the @xmath70 and @xmath71 channels are @xmath72 ( s - wave ) , @xmath73 ( p - wave ) and @xmath74 ( p - wave ) , @xmath75 ( d - wave ) where : @xmath76 for instance the projector @xmath77 probes the d - wave @xmath78 resonance and @xmath79 the p - wave @xmath1 resonance . for more details on the construction and the properties of these projectors we refer to @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will solve the self consistent set of equations ( [ rewrite : b],[hatg],[k - self ] ) with @xmath80 in ( [ t - vacuum ] ) .",
    "the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation in nuclear matter is considerably complicated by the fact that the partial waves , which decouple in the vacuum , start to mix in the medium .",
    "this manifests itself in the presence of further tensor structures in the scattering amplitude not required in the vacuum .",
    "for example , if one starts to iterate the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ rewrite : b ] ) in terms of the vacuum amplitudes @xmath81 incorporating @xmath57 as determined by ( [ k - self ] ) with @xmath82 one finds that @xmath83 can no longer be decomposed into the projectors @xmath84 .",
    "the in - medium solution of the bethe - salpeter equation requires a more general ansatz for the scattering amplitude .",
    "we found that the following ansatz solves the self consistent set of equations : @xmath85}^{(p)}\\,\\bar p_{[1j]}^\\mu    + { \\mathcal m}_{[2 j]}^{(p)}\\,\\bar p_{[2j]}^\\mu\\big)\\ , , \\ ; { \\mathcal t}^\\mu = \\sum_{j=3}^8\\,\\big ( { \\mathcal m}_{[j1]}^{(p)}\\,p_{[j1]}^\\mu    + { \\mathcal m}_{[j2]}^{(p)}\\,p_{[j2]}^\\mu\\big ) \\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\mathcal t } = \\sum_{i , j=1}^2 \\,{\\mathcal m}^{(p)}_{[ij]}\\,p_{[ij ] } \\ , , \\quad   { \\mathcal t}^{\\mu \\nu } = \\sum_{i , j=3}^8\\,{\\mathcal m}_{[ij]}^{(p)}\\,p_{[ij]}^{\\mu \\nu}+ \\sum_{i , j=1}^2\\,{\\mathcal m}^{(q)}_{[ij]}\\,q_{[ij]}^{\\mu \\nu}\\ , , \\label{ansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced appropriate projectors @xmath86}(w , u)$ ] which generalize the vacuum projectors @xmath87 .",

    "the attractive mass shifts for the @xmath192 hyperon ground states of about 10 mev is smaller by about 20 mev as compared to what one expects from phenomenological constraints set by hyper - nuclei @xcite .",
    "our result for the @xmath174 is nevertheless interesting due to strong non - linear effects in density . at twice saturation density",
    "we predict an attractive mass shift of 40 mev .",
    "the source of the non - linear effect is traced back to the t - channel antikaon exchange contribution dominating the hyperon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the strong density dependence of the antikaon spectral function leads to the non - trivial propagation properties of the @xmath174 state .",
    "if we corrected for the missing attraction by a term linear in the density we would predict that the @xmath174 experiences an attractive mass shift of about 80 mev at twice saturation density .",

    "<S> we evaluate the antikaon spectral density in isospin symmetric nuclear matter . the in - medium antikaon - nucleon scattering process and the antikaon propagation is treated in a self consistent and relativistic manner where a maximally scheme - independent formulation is derived by performing a partial density resummation in terms of the free - space antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the latter amplitudes are taken from a covariant and chiral coupled - channel su(3 ) approach which includes s- , p- and d - waves systematically . </S>",
    "<S> particular care is taken on the proper evaluation of the in - medium mixing of the partial waves . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis establishes a rich structure of the antikaon spectral function with considerable strength at small energies . at nuclear saturation density </S>",
    "<S> we predict attractive mass shifts for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of about 60 mev , 60 mev and 100 mev respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the hyperon states are found to exhibit at the same time an increased decay width of about 120 mev for the s - wave @xmath0 , 70 mev for the p - wave @xmath1 and 90 mev for the d - wave @xmath2 resonance .    </S>",
