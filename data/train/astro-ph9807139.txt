    "discovered three decades ago , the phenomenon of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remains one of the mysteries of the universe ( fishman & meegan 1995 ; hartmann 1996 ) .",
    "being isotropically distributed on the sky ( meegan et al .",
    "1996 ) , the bursts are likely to occur at cosmological distances ( paczyski 1992 ; piran 1992 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "their light curves have many random peaks and in spite of extensive statistical studies ( e.g. , nemiroff et al .",
    "1994 ; norris et al .",
    "1996 ; stern 1996 ) , the temporal behavior of grbs remains a puzzle .",
    "in our analysis we used light curves of grbs observed by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) in the energy band , @xmath3 kev , with 64 ms resolution .",
    "the background was subtracted using linear fits to the 1024 ms data . to avoid large poisson fluctuations in the light curves , we excluded dim bursts with peak count rates @xmath4 250 counts per 64 ms bin .",
    "( the background subtraction and the peak search are described in stern , poutanen , & svensson [ 1997 , 1999 ] ) .",
    "long bursts are of particular interest as their internal temporal structure can be studied by spectral analysis over a larger range of time - scales .",
    "we chose bursts with durations @xmath5 s where @xmath6 is the time it takes to accumulate from 5 % to 95 % of the total fluence of a burst .",
    "the resulting sample contains 214 bursts .",
    "we calculated the fourier transform of each light curve , and found the corresponding power density spectrum ( pds ) which is given by the squared fourier amplitude summed for the two frequencies , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "bursts have very diverse pds , so that it is hard to see any systematic shapes in individual pds ( giblin , kouveliotou , & van paradijs 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore proceed studying the statistical properties of pds for our sample of 214 bursts . in particular",
    ", we calculate the average pds .",
    "this is meaningful if the bursts are produced by a common physical mechanism , so that their light curves can be considered as time fragments of the same stochastic process .",
    "such a process was suggested to be responsible for the stretched exponential shape of the average time profile of grbs ( stern 1996 ; stern & svensson 1996 ) .",
    "we search for a signature for the underlying process in the pds statistics .",
    "the averaging of the pds requires a specification of a weight for each burst .",
    "we normalize grb light curves setting their peak count rates to unity .",
    "this corresponds to the pds normalization by the squared peak of the light curve .",
    "we will discuss below how a different normalization would affect the statistics of pds .    in figure 1 ,",
    "the average power density spectrum , @xmath9 , for the sample of 214 peak - normalized bursts is presented .",
    "poisson fluctuations of the time bin counts start to become important at high frequencies , @xmath10 hz . the individual `` poisson level '' of a burst equals its total fluence including the background .",
    "the spectrum above this level displays the intrinsic variability of the signal .",
    "the horizontal solid line in figure 1 shows the averaged normalized poisson level .",
    "the striking feature of the average pds is the power - law behavior over almost 2 orders of magnitude in frequency .",
    "its slope , @xmath11 , is approximately equal to @xmath12 shown by the dashed line .",
    "the deviation from the power - law at the low - frequency end is due to the finite duration of bursts ( the average @xmath6 is about 80 s for our sample ) . to see the behavior of @xmath9 at high frequencies , we smooth it on the scale @xmath13 and multiply by @xmath14 .",
    "the result is shown by the solid curve in the top panel in figure 2 .",
    "the dotted curve displays the same spectrum after subtraction of the poisson level .",
    "the subtraction was performed individually in each burst before the averaging .",
    "this is equivalent to subtraction of the effective level shown in figure 1 from the average pds .",
    "one can see that @xmath9 is very close to a power - law with index @xmath15 in the range @xmath16 hz ( the best power - law fit in this range has @xmath17 ) .",
    "after subtraction of the poisson level , a break appears between 1 and 2 hz .",
    "the existence of this break is better seen for bright grbs , where we do not have to account for the poisson noise .",
    "we therefore also plot the average pds for the 27 bursts with peak count rates @xmath18 counts / bin ( the bottom panel in figure 2 ) . the break is again seen at @xmath2 hz .",
    "the break is too sharp to be explained as an artefact of 64 ms time binning , which suppresses the pds by a factor of @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath20 ms is the time bin ( cf .",
    "van der klis 1989 ) .    is the power - law behavior of the average pds related to the type of normalization we chose ? to test this we tried other normalizations , e.g. , by dividing the light curve by the burst fluence .",
    "we found the same qualitative behavior of the average pds : a power - law of index @xmath21 with super - imposed fluctuations .",
    "for peak - normalization , the fluctuations in @xmath9 are minimal and the best accuracy of the slope @xmath1 is achieved . in this case , the amplitude of statistical fluctuations is consistent with the relation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of bursts in the sample .",
    "power spectra of each individual burst are very diverse and they show strong deviations from the average power - law . the deviations , however , follow a simple statistical behavior .",
    "we constructed the corresponding histogram at each frequency and found that individual @xmath24 are distributed around @xmath9 according to the law @xmath25 .",
    "the histogram is not accurate as the number of bursts ( n=214 ) is modest , but the statistics increases when we sum up the histograms at adjacent frequencies .",
    "after this summation , the @xmath24 distribution remains narrow being described by the exponential law as seen in figure 3 .",
    "note that we get this distribution only when taking the bursts peak - normalized . for comparison",
    ", we also plot an analogous histogram for bursts normalized by fluence .",
    "the pds of each individual burst can be decomposed into the power - law with @xmath12 and super - imposed exponentially distributed fluctuations .",
    "the exponential distribution , also denoted the 2-dimensional @xmath26 distribution , just indicates that the two ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) components of the fourier transform are normally distributed around the average value ( van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "similar fluctuations are present in the pds of the well - known standard noises such as poisson noise ( pds slope @xmath29 ) , flicker noise ( @xmath30 ) , and brownian motion ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "note the difference of the grb variability from the standard noises . in the case of a noise ,",
    "the exponentially distributed fluctuations are suppressed when the pds is smoothed by averaging @xmath24 over adjacent frequencies . by contrast , the smoothed power spectra of grbs continue to show the exponential fluctuations around @xmath9 independently of the smoothing scale .",
    "this behaviour makes it difficult to recognize the power - law in an individual burst .",
    "nevertheless , the standard @xmath24 distribution around the mean slope @xmath1 supports the view that different grbs are random statistical realizations of the same stochastic process described by the power - law .",
    "we conclude that the whole diversity of grbs can be unified : each burst can be considered as a time fragment of the same process which is self - similar on time - scales from @xmath32 s up to the total duration of a burst .",
    "it follows that grbs have a common origin being generated by some standard emission mechanism .",
    "note , however , that only long bursts have been analyzed here , and short bursts may belong to a distinct class , as indicated by their duration distribution ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "the typical time - scale @xmath32 s observed in the pds of long grbs may be connected with the separate class of short , @xmath33 s , bursts .    within the accuracy of measurement ( @xmath33 % ) ,",
    "the slope of the average spectrum equals @xmath1 .",
    "kolmogorov spectrum of velocity fluctuations in a turbulent medium has the same slope .",
    "is it just a coincidence or is it an indication that bursts are somehow related to turbulence ? in the cosmological scenario , the grb emission is generated in a relativistic outflow from a central source ( rees & mszros 1994 ) which is likely to result from the coalescence of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole ( paczyski 1986 ; piran , shemi , & narayan 1993 ) .",
    "turbulence develops easily in a super - sonic outflow and is known to occur , e.g. , in the solar wind ( coleman 1968 ) .",
    "fluctuations of the velocity and magnetic field in the solar wind have pds with slope @xmath1 , which indicates the presence of developed turbulence .    if grbs are due to emission of bright blobs in a relativistic outflow , and the observed radiation is highly sensitive to the direction of the blob velocity , then a fluctuation of the velocity might `` switch off '' or `` switch on '' the blob in the observed light curve .",
    "this is only one of the possible speculations .",
    "a relation between grb light curves and turbulence remains a conjecture until it is supported by a specific emission model .",
    "additional information , which can be used in developing a model , is the 2 hz break in the average pds .",
    "the break implies that pulses shorter than @xmath340.5 s are suppressed in the light curve for some physical reason .",
    "the deficit of short pulses has also been demonstrated directly by analyzing the pulse structure of the light curves ( norris et al .",
    "note that the sharpness of the break supports the assumption of similar conditions in different grbs .",
    "for example , if the lorentz factor of the emitting gas varied strongly from burst to burst we would observe a smooth turnover instead of the sharp break .",
