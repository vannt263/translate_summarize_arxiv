    "heterogeneous and disordered media emerge in several applications in physics , engineering and life sciences .",
    "examples are widespread and concern for instance light propagation through engineered optical materials  @xcite or turbid media  @xcite , tracer diffusion in biological tissues  @xcite , neutron diffusion in pebble - bed reactors  @xcite or randomly mixed immiscible materials  @xcite , inertial confinement fusion  @xcite , and radiation trapping in hot atomic vapours  @xcite , only to name a few .",
    "stochastic geometries provide convenient models for representing such configurations , and have been therefore widely studied  @xcite , especially in relation to heterogeneous materials  @xcite , stochastic or deterministic transport processes  @xcite , image analysis  @xcite , and stereology  @xcite .",
    "a particularly relevant class of random media is provided by the so - called poisson geometries  @xcite , which form a prototype process of isotropic stochastic tessellations : a portion of a @xmath0-dimensional space is partitioned by randomly generated @xmath3-dimensional hyper - planes drawn from an underlying poisson process . the resulting random geometry ( i.e. , the collection of random polyhedra determined by the hyper - planes ) satisfies the important property that an arbitrary line thrown within the geometry will be cut by the hyper - planes into exponentially distributed segments  @xcite . in some sense ,",
    "the exponential correlation induced by poisson geometries represents perhaps the simplest model of ` disordered ' random fields , whose single free parameter ( i.e. , the average correlation length ) can be deduced from measured data  @xcite . following the pioneering works by goudsmit  @xcite , miles  @xcite and richards  @xcite for @xmath4",
    ", the statistical features of the poisson tessellations of the plane have been extensively analysed , and rigorous results have been proven for the limit case of domains having an infinite size : for a review , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "an explicit construction amenable to monte carlo simulations for two - dimensional homogeneous and isotropic poisson geometries of finite size has been established in  @xcite .",
    "theoretical results for infinite poisson geometries have been later generalized to @xmath1 , which is key for real - world applications but has comparatively received less attention , and higher dimensions by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional construction for isotropic poisson geometries has been analogously extended to three - dimensional ( and in principle @xmath0-dimensional ) domains  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will numerically investigate the statistical properties of @xmath0-dimensional isotropic poisson geometries by resorting to monte carlo simulation , with special emphasis on the case @xmath1 .",
    "our aim is two - fold : first , we will focus on finite - size effects and on the convergence towards the limit behaviour of infinite domains . in order to assess the impact of dimensionality on the convergence patterns , comparisons to analogous numerical or exact findings obtained for @xmath5 and @xmath4 ( where available ) will be provided . in so doing ,",
    "we will also present and discuss the simulation results for some physical observables for which exact asymptotic results are not known , yet .",
    "then , we will consider the case of ` coloured ' poisson geometries , where each polyhedron is assigned a label with a given probability .",
    "such models emerge , for instance , in connection to particle transport problems , where the label defines the physical properties of each polyhedron  @xcite .",
    "the case of random binary mixtures , where only two labels are allowed , will be examined in detail . in this context",
    ", we will numerically determine the statistical features of the coloured polyhedra , which are obtained by regrouping into clusters the neighbouring volumes by their common label .",
    "attention will be paid in particular to the percolation properties of such binary mixtures for @xmath1 : the percolation threshold at which a cluster will span the entire geometry , the average cluster size and the probability that a polyhedron belongs to the the spanning cluster will be carefully examined and contrasted to the case of percolation on lattices  @xcite .",
    "the effect of dimensionality will be again assessed by comparison with the case @xmath4 , for which analogous results were numerically determined in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ construction ] we will recall the explicit construction for @xmath0-dimensional isotropic poisson geometries , with focus on @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "[ uncolored_geo ] we will discuss the statistical properties of poisson geometries , and assess the convergence to the limit case of infinite domains . in sec .",
    "[ colored_geo ] we will extend our analysis to the case of coloured geometries and related percolation properties .",
    "conclusions will be finally drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in this section we will recall the strategy for the construction of poisson geometries , spatially restricted to a @xmath0-dimensional box .",
    "the case @xmath5 simply stems from the poisson point process on the line  @xcite , and will not be detailed here .",
    "the explicit construction of homogeneous and isotropic poisson geometries for the case @xmath4 restricted to a square has been originally proposed by  @xcite , based on a poisson point field in an auxiliary parameter space in polar coordinates .",
    "it has been recently shown that this construction can be actually extended to @xmath1 and even higher dimensions  @xcite by suitably generalizing the auxiliary parameter space approach of  @xcite and using the results of  @xcite .",
    "in particular , such @xmath0-dimensional construction satisfies the homogeneity and isotropy properties  @xcite .",
    "the method proposed by  @xcite is based on a spatial decomposition ( tessellation ) of the @xmath0-hypersphere of radius @xmath6 centered at the origin by generating a random number @xmath7 of @xmath3-hyperplanes with random orientation and position .",
    "any given @xmath0-dimensional subspace included in the @xmath0-hypersphere will therefore undergo the same tessellation procedure , restricted to the region defined by the boundaries of the subspace .",
    "the number @xmath7 of @xmath3-hyperplanes is sampled from a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 denotes the surface of the @xmath0-dimensional unit sphere ( @xmath11 being the gamma function  @xcite ) , @xmath12 denotes the volume of the @xmath0-dimensional unit sphere , and @xmath13 is the arbitrary density of the tessellation , carrying the units of an inverse length .",
    "this normalization of the density @xmath13 corresponds to the convention used in  @xcite , and is such that @xmath14 yields the mean number of @xmath3-hyperplanes intersected by an arbitrary segment of length @xmath15 .",
    "is centered in @xmath16 .",
    "the circumscribed sphere centered in @xmath16 has a radius @xmath17 .",
    "the point @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is uniformly sampled in the interval @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 is a random unit vector of components @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the auxiliary variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 are sampled from two independent uniform distributions in the interval @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "the random plane @xmath30 of equation @xmath31 is orthogonal to the vector @xmath22 and intersects the point @xmath18 . ]",
    "let us now focus on the case @xmath1 .",
    "suppose , for the sake of simplicity , that we want to obtain an isotropic tessellation of a box of side @xmath2 , centered in the origin @xmath16 .",
    "this means that the poisson tessellation is restricted to the region @xmath32 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "we denote @xmath6 the radius of the sphere circumscribed to the cube . the algorithm proceeds then as follows .",
    "the first step consists in sampling a random number of planes @xmath7 from a poisson distribution of parameter @xmath33 , where the factor @xmath34 stems from @xmath35 .",
    "the second step consists in sampling the random planes that will cut the cube .",
    "this is achieved by choosing a radius @xmath20 uniformly in the interval @xmath21 $ ] and then sampling two other random numbers , denoted @xmath27 and @xmath28 , from two independent uniform distributions in the interval @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "based on these three random parameters , a unit vector @xmath23 is generated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , with components @xmath36 let now @xmath18 be the point such that @xmath37 .",
    "the random plane @xmath30 will be finally defined by the equation @xmath38 , passing trough @xmath18 and having normal vector @xmath22 . by construction ,",
    "this plane does intersect the circumscribed sphere of radius @xmath6 but not necessarily the cube : the probability that the plane intersects both the sphere and the cube can be deduced from a classical result of integral geometry . for two convex sets @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , the probability that a randomly chosen plane meets both @xmath39 and @xmath40 is given by the ratio @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the mean orthogonal @xmath45-projection of @xmath46 onto an isotropic random line  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 takes also the name of mean caliper diameter of the set @xmath46",
    "@xcite .",
    "the average caliper diameter of a cube of side @xmath2 is @xmath47 , whereas for the sphere the average caliper diameter coincides with its diameter @xmath48 , which yields a probability @xmath49 for the random planes to fall within the cube  , the probability that a random line intercepts both square of side @xmath2 and the circumscribed circle of radius @xmath50 is again given by the ratio of the respective mean caliper diameters , which for @xmath4 are simply proportional to the perimeters of each set ( the so - called barbier - crofton theorem ) .",
    "this yields a probability @xmath51 for a random line to fall within the square  @xcite . ] .",
    "the tessellation is built by successively generating the @xmath7 random planes .",
    "initially , the stochastic geometry is composed of a single polyhedron , i.e. , the cube .",
    "if the first sampled plane intersects the region @xmath32 ^ 3 $ ] , new polyhedra are generated within the cube and the tessellation is updated .",
    "this procedure is then iterated until @xmath7 random planes have been generated . by construction , the polyhedra defined by the intersection of such random planes are convex . for illustration purposes , some examples of isotropic poisson tessellation of a cube of side @xmath52 obtained by monte carlo simulation are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , for different values of the density @xmath13 .",
    "the number of random polyhedra of the tessellation increases with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "the physical observables of interest associated to the stochastic geometries , such as for instance the volume of a polyhedron , its surface , the number of edges , and so on , are clearly random variables , whose statistical distribution we would like to characterize . in the following , we will focus on the case of poisson geometries restricted to a @xmath0-dimensional box of linear size @xmath2 .    . for all realizations ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath52 .",
    "the geometry at the top ( a ) has @xmath53 , that at the middle ( b ) has @xmath54 and that at the bottom ( c ) has @xmath55 . for fixed @xmath2 , the average number of random polyhedra composing the geometry increases with increasing @xmath13 . ]    with a few remarkable exceptions , the exact distributions for the physical observables are unfortunately unknown  @xcite .",
    "a number of exact results have been nonetheless established for the ( typically low - order ) moments of the observables and for their correlations , at least in the limit case of domains having an infinite extension  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulation offers a unique tool for the numerical exploration of the statistical features of poisson geometries .",
    "in particular , by resorting to the algorithm described above we can @xmath56 investigate the convergence of the moments and distributions of arbitrary physical observables to their known limit behaviour ( if any ) , and @xmath57 numerically explore the scaling of the moments and the distributions for which exact asymptotic results are not yet available .",
    "we will thus address these issues with the help of a monte carlo code developed to this aim .      to begin with",
    ", we will first analyse the growth of the number @xmath58 of polyhedra in @xmath0-dimensional poisson geometries as a function of the linear size @xmath2 of the domain , for a given value of the density @xmath13 . in the following",
    ", we will always assume that @xmath54 , unless otherwise specified ( with both @xmath13 and @xmath2 expressed in arbitrary units ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath58 provides a measure of the complexity of the resulting geometries .",
    "the simulation findings for the average number @xmath59 of @xmath0-polyhedra ( at finite @xmath2 ) and the dispersion factor , i.e. , the ratio @xmath60/\\langle n_p|l \\rangle$ ] , @xmath61 denoting the standard deviation , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for large @xmath2",
    ", we find an asymptotic scaling law @xmath62 : the complexity of the random geometries increases with system size and dimension ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , top ) , as expected on physical grounds .",
    "this means that the computational cost to generate a realization of a poisson geometry is also an increasing function of the system size and of the dimension . as for the dispersion factor , an asymptotic scaling law @xmath60/\\langle n_p|l\\rangle \\sim 1/\\sqrt{l}$ ]",
    "is found for large @xmath2 , independent of the dimension ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , bottom ) : for large systems , the distribution of @xmath58 will be then peaked around the average value @xmath59 .",
    "poisson geometries are markovian , which means that in the limit case of infinite domains an arbitrary line will be cut by the @xmath3-surfaces of the @xmath0-polyhedra into segments whose lengths @xmath63 are exponentially distributed , i.e. , @xmath64 with average density @xmath65 .",
    "conversely , the number of intersections @xmath66 of an arbitrary segment of length @xmath15 with the @xmath3-surfaces of the @xmath0-polyhedra in an infinite domain will obey a poisson distribution @xmath67 with mean value @xmath68 .",
    "of @xmath0-polyhedra in @xmath0-dimensional poisson geometries as a function of the linear size @xmath2 of the domain .",

    "the scaling law @xmath70 is displayed for reference with dashed lines . ]    in order to verify that the geometries constructed by resorting to the algorithm described above satisfy the markov properties , we have numerically computed by monte carlo simulation the probability density of the segment lengths and the probability of the number of intersections as a function of the linear size @xmath2 of the domain and for different dimensions @xmath0 . for the former , a poisson geometry",
    "is first generated , and a line is then drawn by uniformly choosing a point in the box and an isotropic direction : this choice corresponds to formally assuming a so - called @xmath71-randomness for the lines  @xcite .",
    "the intersections of the line with the polyhedra of the geometry are computed , and the resulting segment lengths are recorded .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated a large number of times in order to get the appropriate statistics .",
    "for the latter , a test segment of unit length is sampled by choosing a point and a direction as before , and the number of intersections with the polyhedra are again determined .     of the segment lengths as a function of the linear size @xmath2 of the domain , in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "symbols correspond to the monte carlo simulation results , with lines added to guide the eye : blue triangles denote @xmath72 , red diamonds @xmath73 , green circles @xmath74 , black squares @xmath75 , and purple crosses @xmath76 .",
    "the asymptotic ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) exponential distribution given in eq .",
    "is displayed as a black dashed line for reference .",
    "the inset displays the same data in log - linear scale . ]",
    "the numerical results for @xmath78 at finite @xmath2 are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "finite - size effects are apparent in the segment length density : this is due to the fact that the longest line that can be drawn across a box of linear size @xmath2 is @xmath79 , which thus induces a cut - off on the distribution ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the finite - size effects due to the cut - off fade away and the probability densities eventually converge to the expected exponential behaviour .",
    "the rate of convergence appears to be weakly dependent on the dimension @xmath0 ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath5 can be treated analytically and might thus provide a rough idea of the approach to the limit case . for any finite @xmath2 ,",
    "the distribution of the segment lengths for @xmath5 is @xmath81 @xmath82 being the marker function of the domain @xmath46 .",
    "the moments of order @xmath83 of the segment length @xmath63 for finite @xmath2 thus yield @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the incomplete gamma function  @xcite . in the limit case",
    "@xmath77 , we have @xmath86 , so that for the convergence rate we obtain @xmath87 which for large @xmath80 gives @xmath88 thus , the average segment length ( @xmath89 ) converges exponentially fast to the limit behaviour , whereas the higher moments ( @xmath90 ) converge sub - exponentially with power - law corrections . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the cut - off is less abrupt , but the distributions @xmath78 still show a peak at @xmath92 , and vanish for @xmath93 .",
