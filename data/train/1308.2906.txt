    "it is more than ever advisable to take a broad view that integrates across hadronic physics , and to connect with the rest of subatomic physics . '' _ c. quigg , 2011 @xcite _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the across - the - board connection i will focus on here is between the fields of high - energy particle physics and of lower energy hadronic and nuclear physics .",
    "this connection is made possible by the universality of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton , which allows one to calculate a variety of processes from a common set of quark and gluon momentum distributions .",
    "these processes range from high - energy physics interactions such as in @xmath0 collisions at the tevatron or @xmath1 collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) to lower energy electron or hadron collisions on proton as well as nuclear targets .",
    "the former are designed to study qcd and electroweak interactions at the parton level , as well as to search for the higgs boson and for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the latter are designed to explore how qcd builds a hadron out of 3 valence quarks , how its quantum numbers are built up from these and from the `` sea '' of quark - antiquark pairs and gluons , how its properties change in a nuclear medium , and how a nucleus as a bound state of protons and neutrons emerges from the underlying microscopic quark and gluon degrees of freedom",
    ".    one powerful set of tools that exploit the pdf universality are the so called `` global pdf fits@xcite '' .",
    "their original _",
    "rason dtre _ is to utilize experimental data from a number of processes , combined with perturbative qcd calculations of the relevant partonic cross sections , in order to extract the non perturbatively calculable parton distributions .",
    "these in turn can be used to calculate processes not included in the fits , for example the expected rates of higgs boson production in several channels , or various standard or beyond - the - standard model cross sections , such as production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge bosons , kaluza - klein resonances , gluinos , and so on . in this sense , increasing the number of data points to be fitted by including more processes , and improving the theoretical calculations to include a larger portion of the available kinematics , is extremely useful to reduce the uncertainties in the extracted pdfs , thus yielding more accurate theoretical predictions .",
    "this is one way in which lower energy hadronic and nuclear data , which typically access lower momentum scales and larger parton momentum fractions @xmath4 inside a proton than at colliders , can improve the study of high - energy processes .",
    "however , as i will argue here , this phenomenologically very important connection is not necessarily the most far reaching .",
    "indeed , a novel aspect of large-@xmath4 global fits is their ability to connect elements of high - energy physics with hadronic and nuclear physics at medium energy .",
    "for example , data on @xmath5 and @xmath6 forward rapidity boson production at the tevatron and lhc , which can reach large values of @xmath4 , can constrain the extrapolation to @xmath7 of the down - quark to up - quark ratio in the proton . with enough statistical precision",
    "this can indicate which nonperturbative proton structure model best captures the effects of confinement on hadron structure .",
    "here we have collider physics providing insights on hadronic physics .",
    "likewise , but less obviously , global pdf fits can be used as a tool to study the structure of the nucleus and the differences between bound and free protons and neutrons , for which current models display large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this is possible , _",
    "e.g. _ , by exploiting the interplay of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data _ on deuteron targets _ , which allow one to extract a nuclear - model dependent @xmath8 quark distribution at large @xmath4 @xcite , and weak interaction processes _ on proton targets _ , such as the mentioned @xmath5 and @xmath6 production at hadronic colliders , which also depend on the @xmath8 quark but are naturally free from nuclear effects .",
    "since an unrealistic nuclear correction would pull the @xmath8 quark extracted from a global fit away from that required by the proton target data , constraints on the viable nuclear models can then be obtained by studying tensions in these two data sets under global fits .",
    "global fits can thus relate high - energy experiments at the tevatron @xcite or lhc@xcite with nuclear physics experiments at lower energy facilities such as jefferson lab@xcite .",
    "otherwise stated , one can now use proton targets to study qcd in nuclei .",
    "it is the goal of this review to substantiate these claims .",
    "-.3 cm -.5 cm    deep - inelastic lepton - hadron scattering experiments have provided a wealth of data over the past few decades that have yielded considerable information on pdfs over a wide range of @xmath4 and @xmath9 . however , most global fits@xcite have focused on the extraction of leading twist pdfs , utilizing cuts on @xmath9 and the hadronic final state mass @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the nucleon mass , of @xmath12  gev@xmath13 and @xmath14  gev@xmath13 .",
    "the aim of such cuts is to eliminate regions of kinematics where effects that do not scale with @xmath15 may be important , which unfortunately has the effect of excluding a considerable amount of high - precision data that have been collected at intermediate and large values of @xmath4 , see figure  [ fig : disdata ] .",
    "on the other hand , there are many reasons why accurate information on pdfs at high @xmath4 is important . for example",
    ", it is necessary to have control over uncertainties on qcd backgrounds in searches for new physics in collider experiments with final states at large @xmath16 , large invariant mass , or large rapidity@xcite . also , the behavior of pdf ratios , such as the @xmath17 ratio , as @xmath18 can provide insight into the dynamics of quarks and gluons in the nonperturbative region @xcite .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty in the extraction of the spin - dependent gluon pdf at small @xmath4 in forward particle production in polarized @xmath19 collisions is limited by the uncertainties on the quark pdfs at large @xmath4 .    the cteq - jefferson lab ( cj )",
    "collaboration@xcite was formed with the initial aim to include large-@xmath4 and @xmath20 theoretical corrections into perturbative calculations , in order to maximize the use of available experimental data ( in particular from fixed target dis experiments ) and produce accurate fits with a quantitative evaluation of the associated theoretical errors .",
    "earlier efforts in this direction include the work of alekhin _",
    "et al._@xcite and martin _ et al._@xcite    -.3 cm    the cj global pdf fits utilize the world s data on charged lepton dis on proton and deuteron targets , lepton pair production with a proton beam on proton and deuteron targets , @xmath5 asymmetries and @xmath6 rapidity distribution as well as jet production data in @xmath21 collisions .",
    "the theoretical treatment of inclusive dis includes subleading @xmath20 effects , such as target mass correction and ( a fit of ) higher twist terms , and nuclear corrections for the deuterium target data .",
    "the resulting fits@xcite can thus incorporate data down to @xmath22  gev , and have culminated in the release of the `` cj12 '' pdf sets@xcite , valid in the range @xmath23 .",
    "the fits were performed at next - to - leading order in the zero mass variable flavor number scheme , with @xmath24 fixed to the world average value .",
    "( full heavy quark treatments , fits of the strong coupling constant , and inclusion of the available lhc data will be considered in a subsequent analysis . )",
    "the cj pdfs have been shown@xcite to be stable with the weaker cuts on @xmath5 and @xmath9 , and the increased dis data sample ( of about 1000 additional points ) has led to significantly reduced uncertainties of up to 80% on the @xmath8 quark pdf at large @xmath4 , where precise data are otherwise scarce ( see figure [ fig : improvedstat ] ) . since @xmath8 quark flavor separation at large @xmath4 is currently almost entirely dependent on dis on deuterium targets , corrections for nuclear fermi motion and binding effects",
    "are included by convoluting the nucleon structure functions with a smearing function computed from the deuteron wave function @xcite . as the @xmath25 quark is well constrained by data on proton targets ,",
    "the @xmath8 quark becomes directly sensitive to the nuclear corrections .",
    "the effect is a large suppression at high @xmath4 , and a mild but non - negligible increase at intermediate @xmath4 , still inside the `` safe '' region defined by the larger @xmath5 cut discussed above@xcite .",
    "these findings have subsequently been confirmed by ball _",
    "et al._@xcite .    the uncertainties on the cj12 @xmath8 quark pdf from theoretical modeling of nuclear corrections ( which i refer to as `` nuclear uncertainties '' ) have been quantified@xcite . in particular , the size of the nuclear corrections range from mild , corresponding to the hardest of the deuteron wave functions ( wjc-1 ) coupled to a 0.3% nucleon off - shell correction , to strong , corresponding to the softest wave function ( cd - bonn ) and a large , 2.1% nucleon off - shell correction ; the central value corresponds to the av18 deuteron wave function with a 1.2% off - shell correction@xcite .",
    "the resulting pdfs are labeled `` cj12min '' , `` cj12max '' , and `` cj12mid '' , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties on the cj12 @xmath8 quark distribution are illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ fig : cj12d ] , with the central ( red ) band indicating the pdf error calculated with the hessian method and a tolerance factor @xmath26 .",
    "the central ( blue ) band represents the theoretical nuclear uncertainty , obtained as an envelope of the cj12min and cj12max fits , and is of the same order of magnitude as the pdf error .",
    "finally , the outer ( green ) band is the pdf error in a fit that excludes all deuterium data , and exceeds the combined pdf and nuclear uncertainties .",
    "this demonstrates the usefulness of the deuterium data , even in the presence of the nuclear uncertainties that its use introduces .",
    "a further source of theoretical uncertainty was investigated by utilizing a more flexible parametrization for the valence @xmath27 quark at large-@xmath4 , which now includes a small admixture of the valence @xmath28 pdf , @xmath29 , \\label{eq : newd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the @xmath8 quark normalization , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are two additional parameters@xcite .",
    "the result is that the @xmath17 ratio at @xmath18 can now span the range @xmath33 rather than being limited to either 0 or @xmath34 as in all previous pdf fits .",
    "a finite , nonzero value of this ratio is in fact expected from several nonperturbative models of nucleon structure@xcite .",
    "it is also required from a purely practical point of view because it avoids potentially large biases on the fitted @xmath8 quark pdf , as illustrated in the left and middle panels of figure  [ fig : d2uparams ] and discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : theorybiases ] .",
    "-.3 cm    -.1 cm",
    "let us now discuss in turn a hadronic physics and a collider physics application of the fitted cj12 pdfs , and explore the consequences of the nuclear uncertainties in either case .",
    "the ratios of the @xmath8 to @xmath25 pdfs for the three cj12 sets are shown in figure  [ fig : cj12d ] right .",
    "these are constrained up to @xmath35 by the enlarged data set considered in the cj fits , but can be confidently extrapolated to @xmath7 thanks to the modified @xmath8 quark parametrization .",
    "as the magnitude of the nuclear corrections increases , the @xmath17 intercept at @xmath7 rises@xcite . including the pdf errors , it was found that @xmath36 { } \\ , 0.22      \\pm 0.20 \\ , \\text{({\\small pdf } ) }      \\pm 0.10 \\,\\text{(nucl ) } , \\label{eq : dulimit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the central value is obtained as an average of the cj12max and cj12min pdfs , the first error is from the pdf fits , and the second error reflecting the theoretical nuclear uncertainty is obtained by considering the difference between the cj12min and cj12max pdfs .",
    "these values encompass the full 0 - 0.5 range of available theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "however , it is also clear that a relatively modest improvement in statistical precision and reduction of nuclear uncertainty would allow one to restrict the range of allowable physical mechanisms@xcite .",
    "the large nuclear uncertainty in the quark pdf ( and that in the gluon pdf arising from jet - data induced anticorrelation with the @xmath8 quark@xcite ) , have also potentially profound implications for collider experiments . to illustrate this in general terms , consider the differential parton luminosities for production of an object of mass @xmath37 at rapidity @xmath38 in a hadronic collision of center of mass energy @xmath39 , @xmath40 / \\big [ s ( 1+\\delta_{ij } ) \\big ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the differential luminosities , normalized to the reference fit calculation , are shown in figure  [ fig : lum_y ] as a function of @xmath43 for three values of rapidity .",
    "( since the ratios are largely independent of the hard scattering scale , these plots are also independent of @xmath44 ) .",
    "the sensitivity to large @xmath4 pdfs , hence to nuclear uncertainties , grows the larger the mass of the produced object and the larger its rapidity at a given mass .",
    "for example , the nuclear uncertainty becomes relevant for @xmath5 production at rapidity larger than 2 at the tevatron , and larger than 3.5 at the lhc@xcite , as we shall see in more detail . for particles of heavier mass , such as the putative @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons ,",
    "the nuclear uncertainty at large @xmath4 may become large also in the inclusive production cross section@xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : wzprime_incl ] . as the current lhc limits put the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses approximately above 2.5 tev for standard - model like couplings@xcite",

    "the importance of using a more flexible @xmath8-quark parametrization than in traditional fits can not be overemphasized .",
    "figures  [ fig : cj12-udg ] and [ fig : d - biases ] show a comparison of the cj12mid fits to a fit obtained with the standard @xmath49  gev cut , and a fit obtained with @xmath50  gev but standard @xmath8-quark parametrization ( namely , @xmath51 in eq .  ) .",

    "the fit using the standard parametrization starts deviating from the cj12mid fit at @xmath53 .",
    "this behavior is clearly not data driven ( it starts already inside the covered kinematic range ) , but is forced by the use of the functional form @xmath54 rather than the more flexible parametrization .",
    "the dramatic decrease of the standard @xmath8 quark pdf towards 0 can be compensated in the fit by a slightly increased @xmath25 quark and gluon distributions , due to the correlation induced by the large-@xmath4 dis data and jet data , respectively .",
    "further insight can be obtained by considering the @xmath17 ratio in figure  [ fig : d - biases ] . in this case",
    "the standard parametrization forces @xmath17 to take either the value of 0 or @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , the extended @xmath55 parametrization allows for limiting values in the entire range between 0 and @xmath34 . in the cj12 fit",
    ", the data does not seem to warrant the behavior of the standard parametrization , which lies at the edge of the pdf error band of the cj12mid fit .",
    "not only does the standard @xmath8 parametrization underestimate the central fitted value at @xmath53 , it also underestimates the pdf uncertainty , as well as the nuclear uncertainty . as a consequence one could risk , _ e.g. _ , to interpret as signal of new physics",
    "what instead is an artificially small calculated cross section , as it has already happened in the past in analogous situations@xcite .",
    "other potential biases exist at large @xmath4 , related to theoretical corrections not yet included included in the perturbative qcd calculations utilized in the cj12 analysis .",
    "these include large-@xmath4 resummation@xcite , jet mass corrections@xcite , and higher - order terms in the perturbative expansion@xcite .",

    "given the current size of nuclear uncertainties and their impact on phenomenology across low - energy hadron physics and high - energy particle physics , it is imperative to reduce this source of theoretical uncertainty .    on the theory side",
    "the main difficulty resides in the interplay of the hard interaction at the nucleon level , described in terms of partonic degrees of freedom and calculable directly from the qcd lagrangian , and the comparatively soft nucleon - nucleon interactions described in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom with effective interactions fitted to nucleon elastic scattering data .",
    "oftentimes the soft nuclear and hard nucleonic interactions are assumed to factorize , even though this is not formally guaranteed the way qcd factorization theorems allow to separate the hard partonic interactions from nonperturbative pdfs@xcite .",
    "moreover , the medium modifications of the nucleons are almost unknown experimentally , especially in the nucleon momentum range relevant for inclusive dis .",
    "therefore , theoretical models of nuclear corrections seem at present irreducibly unconstrained , and comparison to non - inclusive dis experimental data is mandatory for further theoretical progress .",
    "if , however , one s purpose was solely to obtain a precise enough but nuclear uncertainty free extraction of the @xmath8 quark , one would need new experimental data to compensate for the loss in statistics deriving from excluding the deuteron data shown in figure  [ fig : cj12d ] left .",
    "this new data can come from 2 sources .",
    "the first is data on nuclear targets , but with observables designed to minimize the impact of nuclear corrections , for example , dis on deuteron targets with detection of a slow spectator proton , which guarantees that the electron scatters on a quasi - free neutron , or inclusive dis on 3-helium and tritium , where the nuclear effects largely cancel in the ratio of the respective cross sections ( future bonus 12 and marathon experiments at jefferson lab , respectively@xcite ) .",
    "the second source is weak interactions in proton target collisions .",
    "these contribute , through photon-@xmath6 boson interference , to electron and positron dis cross sections at large @xmath9 only ( for which , unfortunately , the combined run - i hera data@xcite have insufficient large @xmath4 coverage ) , but are of leading order in parity violating charge asymmetries ( recent limited large-@xmath4 coverage @xmath57 measurements at hera@xcite , and future solid@xcite and pvdis@xcite experiments at jefferson lab ) . in principle , weak charged currents can also be directly measured in neutrino and anti - neutrino scattering on proton targets , for which however the old wa21/25 data@xcite can not be easily used in global fits , and no new data is planned for the foreseeable future .",
    "this leaves one with @xmath5 and @xmath6 boson production in @xmath58 collisions at tevatron and @xmath1 collisions at rhic and the lhc , which i shall focus on next .",
    "-.3 cm    as discussed at the end of section  [ sec : overview ] , global qcd fits allow for the intriguing possibility to combine deuteron and proton target data to obtain experimental constraints on the nuclear models , and at the same time fully utilize the available statistics of the nuclear target data .",
    "this is very well demonstrated by considering the directly reconstructed @xmath5 asymmetry at tevatron .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : w_asym ] , this process is very sensitive to nuclear corrections at @xmath59 , and the comparison@xcite with the very precise cdf data@xcite , as well as the total @xmath60 values in the cj12 fits , suggests that nuclear effects are somewhere between the minimum and central ones considered in the cj12min and cj12mid fits , respectively .",
    "this was also confirmed in a similar analysis by martin _",
    "et al._@xcite , where however the nuclear correction was assumed to be @xmath9 independent and directly fitted to data rather than calculated in a model . on the phenomenological side , this result disfavors nonperturbative proton models based on the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry , which predict @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "more importantly , it exemplifies the power of global fits in combining data from across the board , and is the first step in establishing the experimental foundation that was until now missing for a qualitative jump in our ability to theoretically understand and describe high - energy processes in nuclei  and this with proton targets !",
    "interestingly , this procedure is not limited to deuteron targets , but can in principle be adapted to provide a new line of experimental constraints of nuclear effects in heavier nuclei , thus shedding new light on the emc effect that for more than 30 years has eluded a satisfying theoretical explanation@xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 charge asymmetry at cdf unfortunately seems the only observable that currently has this potential .",
    "the asymmetry in lepton production from @xmath5 decays has insufficient large @xmath4 coverage due to decay vertex smearing , while @xmath6 rapidity distributions from cdf and d  have insufficient precision@xcite . at the lhc",
    "one would need measurements with better than 10% precision at @xmath63 , namely , at the edge of the lhcb acceptance for @xmath64 tev , and the experimental accuracy of the @xmath5 asymmetry is inherently reduced due to the difference between @xmath1 scattering compared to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , inclusion of the available lhc data in the cj fits is underway to quantify its impact on nuclear uncertainty constraints .",
    "the potential of large rapidity @xmath5 and @xmath6 measurements in proton - proton collisions at the rhic@xcite should also be explored . in particular@xcite ,",
    "the star detector can in principle provide directly reconstructed @xmath5 asymmetries at pseudorapidity @xmath65 using the central detector , accessing the @xmath8 quarks at @xmath66 , and possibly up to @xmath67 using the end cap , which will access the @xmath68 region we have been focusing on in this review .",
    "although this is a challenging measurement@xcite , it would provide one with an important validation of the cdf measurement@xcite , as well as a test of its energy dependence . of further interest would be measurements of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and dilepton production in proton - deuteron collisions at large rapidity in the deuteron direction@xcite : these would access large-@xmath4 quarks in the deuteron and test theoretical nuclear corrections in a complementary way to electron - deuteron dis measurements .",
    "looking at the future , one could also envisage utilizing the sensitivity of large-@xmath4 gluons to nuclear corrections ( induced by their correlation with @xmath8-quark in jet data ) to further constrain nuclear models analogously to what i am proposing here for the @xmath8 quark .",
    "this would require a further observable sensitive to large-@xmath4 gluons in protons , _",
    "e.g. _ , data on top quark production from tevatron and lhc , which is directly sensitive to large-@xmath4 gluons@xcite , and furthermore free from the subleading in @xmath56 corrections that limit the sensitivity of longitudinal @xmath69 structure function or cross section measurements in fixed target dis experiments",
    ". the planned electron - ion collider@xcite and large hadron - electron collider@xcite projects will be able to perform a complete set of structure function measurements for gluon and quark flavor separation at large @xmath4 ( and large @xmath9 ) .",
    "finally , new experiments focused on large rapidity particle production , such as the proposed after@lhc experiment@xcite , would provide invaluable data to not only obtain precise large-@xmath4 pdfs , but also and more in general to investigate qcd in the nuclear medium .",
    "the recent cteq - jefferson lab collaboration investigations , culminating in the public cj12 pdf release@xcite , have demonstrated the intimate interconnection of hadronic and high - energy physics , exemplifying one of the across - the - board connections called for in the opening quote by c.  quigg for further progress in these fields .",
    "namely , global qcd fits have become capable of constraining theoretical models of nuclear corrections in the deuteron ( as well as in heavier nuclei ) .",
    "not only will this reduce the nuclear uncertainty on the fitted pdfs with important phenomenological consequences on physics ranging from nonperturbative proton structure to beyond the standard model interactions , it will also provide a new avenue for progress in the theoretical understanding of high - energy processes involving _ nuclei _",
