    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the behaviors of the abundances of sodium in disk / halo stars in our galaxy .",
    "recently , we carried out an extensive non - lte abundance analysis of potassium based on the k  i 7699 resonance line and found a tendency of mildly supersolar [ k / fe ] ratios for metal - poor stars just similar to the case of @xmath11-capture elements ( takeda et al .",
    "2002 ) . as a continuation of that study",
    ", we pay attention this time to another similar alkali element , sodium ( na ) .    the main site of na synthesis is considered to be the hydrostatic carbon burning inside massive stars ( e.g. , woosley , weaver 1995 ) , though other manufacturing processes ( e.g. , nena cycle in the h - burning shell , type i supernova , etc .",
    ") are possible and may have an appreciable affection on its chemical history ( see , e.g. , timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) . as an odd-@xmath12 ( neutron - rich ) element , its production is sensitive to the neutron excess and therefore metal - dependent .",
    "hence , clarifying the behavior of its abundance in terms of the cosmic metallicity would provide us important information concerning the variation of the yield , the detailed mechanism of the synthesis , and the galaxy evolution models ( initial mass function , infall , etc ) .",
    "unlike the case of potassium , a reasonable number of adequate lines are available for sodium abundance determinations , which lie mostly in the visible through near - ir wavelength regions .",
    "hence , many observational studies have so far been performed over these two decades ( see , e.g. , the references quoted in the recent theoretical papers such as timmes et al . 1995 , samland 1998 , and goswami , prantzos 2000 ) . nevertheless , the behavior of [ na / fe ] is currently still controversial and has not yet been settled .",
    "it has generally been considered until mid-1990 s that na almost scales with fe at all metallicities though with a considerable scatter around [ na / fe ]  @xmath4  0 .",
    "[ see , for example , subsubsection 3.5.3 of timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for a review on the situation at the time of early 1990 s . ]",
    "actually , a nearly solar ratio was obtained even for extremely metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] down to @xmath13 ) by the extensive study of mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995b ) using the resonance d lines ( na  i 5890/5896 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that most of these previous studies were done based on the assumption of lte .    in late 1990",
    "s , however , new studies have appeared that cast doubt to this classical picture .",
    "baum \" uller et al .",
    "( 1998 ) investigated the non - lte formation of various na  i lines and found considerable ( negative ) non - lte corrections reaching @xmath14 dex for the d lines , by which a systematic tendency of _ decreasing _ [ na / fe ] ratios is obtained toward a metal - poor regime ( [ na / fe ] @xmath15 at [ fe / h ] @xmath9 ) .",
    "similarly , the ( lte ) analysis of stephens ( 1999 ) for halo dwarf stars based on high - quality spectra of na  i 5683/5688 subordinate lines suggested that [ na / fe ] progressively decreases ( from [ fe / h ] @xmath16 to [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) down to the value of @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , it appears that a proper account of the non - lte effect is mandatory for studying stellar sodium abundances , at least for the resonance na  i 5890/5896 d lines visible even in extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "then , what about other subordinate lines , such as na  i 6154/6161 lines ( widely used for relatively metal - rich population i disk stars ) , 5683/5688 lines ( often used for typical halo stars with [ fe / h ] of @xmath17 to @xmath18 ) , 8183/8195 lines ( not so popular due to their unfavorable wavelength location but potentially useful abundance indicators because of the clear visibility even down to [ na / h ] @xmath9 ) ? do they also suffer an appreciable non - lte effect ?",
    "any definite conclusion on the galactic [ na / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] behavior should await until this problem is clarified , because different lines are used case by case depending on the stellar metallicity .",
    "admittedly , several elaborate and important studies have recently been done concerning the non - lte effect on na abundance determinations for solar - type stars ( e.g. , baum \" uller et al . 1998 ; gratton et al . 1999 ; korotin , mishenina 1999 ; mashonkina et al .",
    "we would say , however , that their results are not presented in sufficient detail for the purpose of practical applications ; i.e. , they tend to be confined to only specific lines of interest or only representative atmospheric parameters , and it is not necessarily easy for the reader to assess how all those na  i lines of importance are affected by the non - lte effect for stars showing a diversity of atmospheric parameters .    in view of this necessity , we decided to ( 1 ) carry out non - lte calculations on the neutral sodium for a wide range of atmospheric parameters with an intention of applying to those 4 line pairs mentioned above , ( 2 ) construct useful grids of non - lte corrections , and ( 3 ) perform extensive abundance analysis toward establishing the na abundances of disk / halo stars with a variety of metallicities based on our own new observations / measurements along with the published equivalent widths taken from various literature .",
    "the following sections of this paper are organized as follows .",
    "our statistical - equilibrium calculations on neutral sodium and the resulting non - lte corrections are explained in section 2 , where we also discuss uncertain factors or adopted approximations involved in the abundance determination based on some theoretical test calculations .",
    "our observational data obtained at two observatories are explained in section 3 , followed by section 4 where we describe the procedures of the abundance analysis using these data along with the reanalysis of the extensive literature data .",
    "we discuss in section 5 the results obtained in section 4 , especially in terms of the [ na / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation and its implications , while referring to the representative theoretical calculations of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "finally , the conclusion of this paper is presented in section 6 .",
    "the procedures of our statistical - equilibrium calculations for neutral sodium , based on a na  i atomic model comprising 92 terms and 178 radiative transitions , are essentially the same as those described in takeda and takada - hidai ( 1994 ) and takeda ( 1995 ) , which should be consulted for details .",
    "one difference is the choice of the background model atmospheres ; i.e. , instead of kurucz s ( 1979 ) atlas6 models adopted in those old works , the photoionizing radiation field was computed based on kurucz s ( 1993a ) atlas9 model atmospheres while incorporating the line opacity with the help of kurucz s ( 1993b ) opacity distribution functions .",
    "it should also be mentioned that a reduction factor of 0.1 ( logarithmic correction of @xmath19 according to the definition of takeda 1995 ) was applied to the h  i collision rates computed with classical approximate formula ( steenbock , holweger 1984 ; takeda 1991 ) according to the empirical determination of takeda ( 1995 ) , though test calculations by varying this correction factor from 1 to @xmath20 were also performed ( cf .",
    "subsection 2.3 below ) .",
    "since we planned to make our calculations applicable to stars from near - solar metallicity ( population i ) down to very low metallicity ( extreme population ii ) at late - f through early - k spectral types in various evolutionary stages ( i.e. , dwarfs , subgiants , giants , and supergiants ) , we carried out non - lte calculations on an extensive grid of 125 ( @xmath21 ) model atmospheres resulting from combinations of five @xmath22 values ( 4500 , 5000 , 5500 , 6000 , 6500 k ) , five @xmath23 values ( 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 ) , and five metallicities ( represented by [ fe / h ] ) ( 0.0 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) . as for the stellar model atmospheres , we adopted kurucz s ( 1993a ) atlas9 models corresponding to a microturbulent velocity ( @xmath28 ) of 2  km  s@xmath29 .",
    "regarding the sodium abundance used as an input value in non - lte calculations , we assumed @xmath30 = 6.33 + [ fe / h ] , where the solar sodium abundance of 6.33 was adopted from anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) ( which is used also in the atlas9 models ) .",
    "namely , a metallicity - scaled sodium abundance was assigned to metal - poor models .",
    "the microturbulent velocity ( appearing in the line - opacity calculations along with the abundance ) was assumed to be 2  km  s@xmath29 , to make it consistent with the model atmosphere .      in figure 1",
    "are shown the @xmath31 ( the ratio of the line source function to the planck function , and nearly equal to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the non - lte departure coefficients for the lower and upper levels , respectively ) and @xmath35 ( the nlte - to - lte line - center opacity ratio , and nearly equal to @xmath36 ) for each of the multiplet 1 ( 5890/5896 ) and multiplet 4 ( 8183/8195 ) transitions ( non - lte effects are especially important for these two doublets ; cf .",
    "subsection 5.1 ) for a representative set of model atmospheres .",
    "we can read the following characteristics from this figure , which are mostly the same as those obtained for the case of k  i 7699 ( takeda et al . 2002 ) : +  in almost all cases , the inequality relations of @xmath37 ( dilution of line source function ) and @xmath38 ( enhanced line - opacity ) hold in the important line - forming region for both cases of multiplets 1 and 4 , which means that the non - lte effect almost always acts in the direction of strengthening the 5890/5896 and 8183/8195 lines .",
    "( e.g. , @xmath22=4500  k , @xmath39 , [ fe / h ] = 0.0 ) , where the line can be marginally weakened ( i.e. , positive abundance correction ) by the enhanced @xmath40 over @xmath41 in the line - forming region ( cf .",
    "the footnote in subsection 5.3 ) .",
    "] actually , more important is the former @xmath40-dilution effect which appreciably deepens / darkens the core of saturated lines in such a way that would never be accomplished under the assumption of lte [ where the residual intensity can not become lower than @xmath42 ; hence , this raises the flat part of the curve of growth , and if this increase in the saturated - line strength is to be accounted for within the framework of lte , a large abundance variation would have to be invoked .",
    "as a result , the extent of the non - lte effect significantly depends on the line - strength in the sense that it becomes most conspicuous for the lines in the flat part .",
    "( see , e.g. , strenburg , holweger 1990 , especially figure 15 of subsection 4.3 therein . )",
    "this situation is demonstrated in figure 2 , where the non - lte corrections ( see subsection 2.3 below ) for the 5896 and 8195 lines are shown as functions of the equivalent width for representative model atmospheres .",
    "+  there is a tendency that the non - lte effect is enhanced with a lowering of the gravity , as naturally expected .",
    "+  the departure from lte appears to be larger for higher @xmath22 in the high - metallicity ( 1@xmath43 ) case , while this trend becomes ambiguous , or even inverse , in the low - metallicity case .",
    "+  toward a lower metallicity , the extent of the non - lte departure tends to decrease , but the departure appears to penetrate deeper in the atmosphere , which makes the situation rather complex .",
    "+  for a very strong damping - dominated case ( i.e. , lowest @xmath22 and highest metallicity ) , the departure from lte shifts toward the upper atmosphere and the non - lte effect becomes comparatively insignificant .",
    "based on the results of these calculations , we computed extensive grids of the theoretical equivalent - widths and the corresponding non - lte corrections for the considered eight lines ( na  i 5683 , 5688 , 5890 , 5896 , 6154 , 6161 , 8183 , and 8195 ) for each of the model atmospheres as follows .    for an assigned sodium abundance ( @xmath44 ) and microturbulence ( @xmath45 ) , we first calculated the non - lte equivalent width ( @xmath46 ) of the line by using the computed non - lte departure coefficients ( @xmath47 ) for each model atmosphere .",
    "next , the lte ( @xmath48 ) and nlte ( @xmath49 ) abundances were computed from this @xmath46 while regarding it as if being a given observed equivalent width .",
    "we can then obtain the non - lte abundance correction , @xmath50 , which is defined in terms of these two abundances as @xmath51 .",
    "strictly speaking , the departure coefficients [ @xmath52 for a model atmosphere are applicable only to the case of the sodium abundance ( @xmath30 ) and the microturbulence ( 2  km  s@xmath29 ) adopted in the non - lte calculations ( cf . subsection 2.1 ) . nevertheless , considering the fact that the departure coefficients ( i.e. , _ ratios _ of nlte to lte number populations ) are ( unlike the population itself ) not much sensitive to small changes in atmospheric parameters , we also applied such computed @xmath47 values to evaluating @xmath50 for slightly different @xmath44 and @xmath45 from those fiducial values assumed in the statistical equilibrium calculations .",
    "hence , we evaluated @xmath50 for three @xmath44 values ( @xmath30 and @xmath53 dex perturbation ) as well as three @xmath28 values ( 2  km  s@xmath29 and @xmath54  km  s@xmath29 perturbation ) for a model atmosphere using the same departure coefficients .",
    "we used the width9 program ( kurucz 1993a ) , which had been modified to incorporate the non - lte departure in the line source function as well as in the line opacity , for calculating the equivalent width for a given abundance , or inversely evaluating the abundance for an assigned equivalent width .",
    "the adopted line data ( @xmath55 values , radiation damping constants , etc . ) are given in table 1 .",

    "the data presented here are based on table 1 of takeda and takada - hidai ( 1994 ) , who consulted the compilation of wiese et al .",
    "each line was treated as if it is a single line , while neglecting any hyperfine structure ( cf .",
    "subsection 2.3 ) .",
    "see also subsection 2.3 for the treatment of the quadratic stark effect damping and of the van der waals effect damping .",
    "one of the controversial factors in abundance determinations for late - type stars is the choice of the van der waals effect damping constant .",
    "regarding this parameter , we assumed the classical unsld s ( 1955 ) formula unchanged , which means the adoption of @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is connected to the damping width as @xmath69 ) . while this choice is based on our previous empirical investigations ( cf .",
    "appendix a of takeda , takada - hidai 1994 ; subsection 4.2 of takeda 1995 ) , we actually confirmed that this choice is reasonable from the analysis of solar na  i lines ( cf .",
    "subsection 4.2 ) .",
    "anyhow , the precise value of this correction is not very essential unless very strong lines are used , as can be seen from figure 3 where the abundance changes expected by using @xmath70 are graphically displayed .",
    "namely , the maximum change is @xmath71 at most occurring only in the case of very strong damping - dominated lines and the low - temperature condition where @xmath72 dominates @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "regarding the quadratic stark effect damping ( @xmath75 , which is comparatively insignificant in late - type stars ) , we followed the peytremann s formula ( kurucz 1979 , p.8 ) .",
    "note also that we neglected the hyperfine structure ( hfs ; see , e.g. , table 4 of mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995b for the 5890/5896 lines , and table 1 of takeda , takada - hidai 1994 for the 8195 line ) while treating each line as being purely single , because of a technical reason .",
    "however , this does not make any serious affection ( several hundredths dex in most cases of actual importance ) as illustrated in figure 4 .    as a demonstrative example of non - lte corrections , we give the @xmath28 = 1  km  s@xmath29 results for the na  i  5896 and 8195 lines computed for representative parameters [ chosen to be nearly compatible with baum \" uller et al.s ( 1998 ) calculations ] in table 2 , where we also present the cases of @xmath76 in addition to the fiducial @xmath19 case ( @xmath77 is the logarithmic h  i collision correction ) for a comparison . comparing this table 2 with baum \" uller et al.s ( 1998 ) table 2 ( where they adopted @xmath78 or @xmath79 )",

    "yet , it should be kept in mind that difficulties are involved in measuring the equivalent widths of very strong damping - dominated lines such as the 5890/5896 d lines , with which errors are more or less involved . nevertheless , comparing the solar ( moon ) equivalent width measured by us with those taken from the literature ( cf .",

    "accordingly , we decided to present the results of the reanalyzes on the data before and after 1990 separately .",
    "figure 6 shows the resulting [ na / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations and the corresponding non - lte corrections derived from the older data before 1990 , while those obtained from the analyses of the recent data after 1990 are displayed in figure 7 .    the same results as those in figure 7a ( the reanalysis results based on the new data after 1990 ) are also depicted in figure 8a , where the [ na / fe ] data are plotted with a more compressed vertical scale ( for the purpose of clarifying the global tendency ) and low- and high - gravity stars are distinguished by different symbols .",
    "in addition , figure 8b shows the @xmath22 vs. @xmath23 plots relevant to these data ; it can be seen from this figure that most of the high - gravity stars are comparatively higher @xmath22 stars of mid - f through late - g type , while low - gravity stars mainly consist of late - g through early - k giants of lower @xmath22 and show a positive correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( reflecting the evolutionary sequence ) .",
    "we may state from an inspection of figure 8a that any meaningful systematic @xmath23-dependent difference does not exist in the [ na / fe ] values ; however , the biased sample ( i.e. , very low - metallicity stars tend to be low - gravity giants , and vice versa ) prevents us from making any definite argument regarding this point .",
    "the details of these analyses ( the data of the used equivalent widths and the adopted parameter values , the resulting non - lte abundances or [ na / fe ] values with the non - lte corrections , given for each line / multiplet and for each star ) are available only electronically as `` tables e2''(from the ftp site mentioned at the end of subsection 2.3 ) .",
    "figures 5 , 6 , and 7 clearly show how the non - lte effect acts on different na  i lines in sodium abundance determinations for stars of various metallicities .",
    "roughly speaking , a simple principle appears to hold : the non - lte effect ( negative corrections to the corresponding lte abundances ) tends to be most important for rather strong saturated lines ( with equivalent widths of 100300 m@xmath65 ) on the flat part of the curve of growth , and it becomes progressively insignificant towards decreasing strengths ( i.e. , unsaturated weak lines on the linear part ) as well as increasing strengths ( i.e. , extremely strong damping - dominated lines in the damping part ) , reflecting the importance of the core - deepening effect caused by the dilution of @xmath40 as already mentioned in subsection 2.2 ( cf .",
    "figure 2 ) .",
    "this naturally explains the behaviors of the extent of the non - lte corrections for each line at different metallicities ; for example , the reason why the weak 6154/6161 lines in disk stars show almost negligible non - lte effects ( cf .",
    "figure 5c ) , why the @xmath80 values for the 8183/8195 attain maximum at [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "figures 5d , 6b , and 7b ) , and why the @xmath80 values for the 5890/5896 lines systematically decreases from [ fe / h ] @xmath8 to @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "figure 7b ) .",
    "we should note , however , that the situation more or less differs from line to line , reflecting their individual properties .",
    "for example , lines at longer wavelengths tend to suffer larger non - lte effects because of the decreasing sensitivity of the planck function to the temperature ( i.e. , the minimum allowed lte residual intensity tends to be raised and thus the difference between lte and non - lte becomes more significant ) . hence , we can understand the fact that the near - ir 8183/8195 lines show relatively larger non - lte effects compared to the other lines at similar line - strengths .",
    "based on figures 57 , we can assess the importance of the non - lte effect on different lines in sodium abundance determinations as follows : the 6154/6161 lines are the best abundance indicators , for which the non - lte effect is practically insignificant ( i.e. , @xmath141 dex ) and may be neglected , though they are usable / visible only at @xmath142 [ fe / h ] @xmath143 ) .",
    "the 5683/5688 lines may also be tolerably analyzed with lte at the metallicity of @xmath144 [ fe / h ] @xmath145 . regarding the 5890/5896 and 8183/8195 lines , which are important for diagnosing the na abundance behaviors of very metal - deficient stars because of their strengths ( especially , the 5890/5896 d lines are the only tool for investigating the extremely metal - poor regime of @xmath0 [ fe / h ] @xmath146 )",
    ", we consider that properly taking account of the non - lte effect is necessary .",
    "the overall behavior of the na abundances for disk stars ( @xmath147 [ fe / h ] @xmath148 ) has long been known to nearly scale with fe ; i.e. , [ na / fe ] @xmath149 ( e.g. , wallerstein 1962 ; tomkin et al . 1985 ) .",
    "there remains almost no doubt for this broad description , which may be confirmed also in our figures 57 .",
    "showing markedly positive [ na / fe ] values in contrast to others .",
    "these stars are expected to have suffered evolution - induced na enrichment in the envelope caused by the dredge - up of nena cycle products in the h - burning shell , such as the case of supergiants ( takeda , takada - hidai 1994 ) .",
    "hence , their abundance characteristics should be discriminated from those related to the galactic chemical evolution . ]",
    "however , our attention is paid rather to the more delicate systematic trend in the [ na / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation ; namely , the `` upturn '' revealed by edvardsson et al.s ( 1993 ) analyses based on the 6154/6161 lines , characterized by slight upward increases on both sides of the broad minimum around [ fe / h ]  @xmath150 .",
    "carretta et al.s ( 2000 ) reanalysis on edvardsson et al.s ( 1993 ) data also reproduced this tendency , as shown in figure 9 in their paper .",
    "similarly , our reanalyzed results on edvardsson et al.s ( 1993 ) data are essentially the same as their original results ( cf .",
    "small open circles in figure 5c ) .",
    "supportive evidences for this trend have been reported from successive analyses on independent observational materials .",
    "feltzing and gustafsson ( 1998 ) confirmed in their na  i 6154/6161 analyses of metal - rich stars that [ na / fe ] progressively increases from @xmath149 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath149 ) to @xmath151 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath152 ) ( see the dots in figure 5c ) .",
    "they also investigated its behavior in the kinematically different stellar groups to see if there is any position - dependent effect in the galactic chemical evolution , though distinct differences were not observed .",
    "also , chen et al.s ( 2000 ) lte analyses of 6154/6161 lines based on the bao data of disk stars ( common to this study ) suggested a weak minimum at [ fe / h ] @xmath150 superposed on the nearly flat [ na / fe ] ( @xmath149 ) ( cf .",
    "figure 8 therein ) consistent with that found by edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    as mentioned in the previous subsection , the non - lte corrections on the na  i 6154/6161 lines usually used in sodium abundance analyses of disk stars are so small that they are practically negligible .",
    "therefore , it is expected that our non - lte analyses on these orange lines of multiplet 5 reproduce essentially the same results as obtained by chen et al . ( 2000 ) , which is actually confirmed in figure 5c .",
    "we point out , however , that our non - lte [ na / fe ] values ( on the bao data ) derived from other stronger lines ( 5683/5688 , 5890/5896 , and 8195 ) also show signs of `` upturn '' , ( tough not so clear as the case of 6154/6161 lines ) in spite of their inadequacy for abundance determinations , as can be seen from figures 7a , b , and d. hence , we may state that this trend is firmly ascertained .    considering the decline of the [ na / fe ] values for a decrease of [ fe / h ] both on the metal - poor side ( [ fe / h ] @xmath145 ; cf .",
    "the next subsection ) and the metal - rich side ( @xmath153 [ fe / h ] ; cf .",
    "feltzing , gustafsson 1998 ) , the existence of such an `` upturn '' may indicate an extra production of sodium at the cosmic metallicity of @xmath147 [ fe / h ] @xmath154 .",
    "however , any speculation had better be put off until the behaviors of other elements closely related to the synthesis of na , especially al and mg , have been established .    according to our reanalysis results for prochaska et al.s ( 2000 ) data ( cf .",
    "diamonds in figure 7 ) , the [ na / fe ] values of thick disk stars do not appear to exhibit significantly distinct differences from those of normal thin - disk stars , though our mean non - lte @xmath155[na / fe]@xmath156 averaged over their 10 stars are nearly zero [ @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) for 5683/5688 and 6154/6166 lines , respectively ] and slightly smaller than the value ( 0.087 ) they obtained , which may be due to the non - lte effect ( mean non - lte corrections are @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively ) .",
    "now , we discuss the behavior of [ na / fe ] for metal - poor halo stars . for simplicity",
    ", our discussion is confined to figure 7 , the results of our reanalyzes based on the data taken from the works after 1990 , which may presumably be more accurate and reliable than those in figure 6 for the reasons mentioned in subsection 4.3 .",
    "one important feature that can be read from figure 7 is the systematic decrease of [ na / fe ] ; i.e. , from [ na / fe ] @xmath149 at [ fe / h ] @xmath16 down to [ na / fe ] @xmath6 ( though a rather large diversity of @xmath7 ) at [ fe / h ] @xmath8 .",
    "this means that we have reasonably reconfirmed the recent results of baumller et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and stephens ( 1999 ) , as opposed to the previous belief until mid 1990 s ( cf .",
    "section 1 ) . it should be stressed that each of the different multiplet lines [ 5683/5688 ( stephens et al .",
    "1999 ; half - filled circles ) , 5890/5896 ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995a ; filled circles ) , 6154/6161 ( kraft et al .",
    "1992 ; double circles ) and 8183/8195 ( our oao data ; st .",
    "andrew s crosses ) ] yield consistent results with each other , in spite of the considerably different extents of the non - lte corrections .",
    "thus , we may state that this subsolar [ na / fe ] ratios in metal - poor stars of @xmath144  [ fe / h ]  @xmath145 are firmly established , 40005000 k , @xmath161 02 , and @xmath162 [ fe / h ] @xmath163 , which do not reveal any such clear subsolar tendency [ @xmath155[na / fe]@xmath156 = @xmath164 on the average ] unlike the other cases mentioned above , despite their original lte results showed a moderate subsolar trend ( @xmath155[na / fe]@xmath156 = @xmath165 ; cf .",
    "pilachowski et al .",
    "we point out that some of their program stars are low temperature / gravity k giants with parameters of @xmath166  k or @xmath167 , which are outside the parameter grid of our non - lte correction tables and the applied non - lte correction had to be evaluated by an extrapolation . in these low temperature / gravity cases",
    ", it exceptionally happens that the non - lte effect tends to act as a line - weakening mechanism ( i.e. , marginally positive non - lte correction ) due to the enhanced @xmath40 ( @xmath168 ) in the line - forming region according to our calculations , as mentioned in footnote 1 in subsection 2.2 .",
    "hence , though appreciable positive non - lte corrections are actually observed for several stars in figure 7b ( filled triangles ) , these are all such low - gravity k giants for which this effect may have been rather erroneously exaggerated by inaccurate extrapolations . also , because of the low - temperature nature of the pilachowski et al.s ( 1996 ) program stars , the strengths of the 5890/5896 d lines are considerably large ( 200400 m@xmath65 ) in spite the low metallicity and comparatively large ambiguities are expected ( e.g. , equivalent - width measurements , how to choose the damping parameter or the microturbulent velocity ) .",
    "consequently , our reanalysis results on their data may suffer large uncertainties and should not be seriously taken . ] while previous lte analyses using the non - lte sensitive lines ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995b , who invoked 5890/5896 lines ) must have overestimated the sodium abundances .    turning our attention to the further extreme metal - poor regime of @xmath0 [ fe / h ] @xmath146 , we see in figure 7 an interesting trend of rising [ na / fe ] for a lowering of the metallicity , again recovering [ na / fe ] @xmath149 at [ fe / h ] @xmath13 , though a rather insufficient number of stars in this region prevents us from making any definitive argument . it is highly desired to increase the sample of those stars toward establishing the behavior of [ na / fe ] in this ultra - low metallicity region , which is very important for investigating the history of the early - time galaxy as well as for constructing the realistic model of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "finally , we compare the observed [ na / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations obtained for the metal - deficient halo stars with representative theoretical predictions calculated by using various chemical evolution models of our galaxy . as mentioned in section 1 , since the production of na is dependent on the excess neutrons , its yield should naturally be metallicity - dependent and increase with time . as a matter of fact , the assumption of constant yield results in a totally unrealistic [ na / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation with a markedly negative @xmath169[na / fe]/@xmath169[fe / h ] gradient ( cf . the dashed line labeled `` gp(const ) '' in figures 6 and 7 , which was taken from figure 7 of goswami , prantzos 2000 ) .",
    "it may be possible , therefore , to judge which modeling of na production ( among several proposed chemical evolution calculations ) represents the actual situation best by comparing the predicted [ na / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation with that observed for halo stars mentioned above .    for this purpose ,",
    "theoretical predictions taken from three recent representative works are depicted in figures 6 and 7 ; i.e. , those of timmes et al . ( 1995 ; solid lines ) , samland ( 1998 ; dashed - dotted line ) , and goswami and prantzos ( 2000 ; dashed lines )",
    ". we can draw from figure 7 the following conclusions . +  among these , timmes et al.s ( 1995 ) results , especially for the case of reduced fe yield denoted as `` tww ( 1/2 @xmath43 ) '' ( cf .",
    "figure 8a ) , appear to most satisfactorily reproduce the observed tendency of [ na / fe ] ( i.e. , broad / shallow dip - like feature with a minimum around [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) mentioned above .",
    "their calculations are based on woosley and weaver s ( 1995 ) yields , simple dynamical model for the galaxy with infall , a standard salpeter ( 1955 ) initial - mass function ( imf ) and a quadratic schmidt star - formation rate .",
    "( each line corresponds to the different choice of the fe yield from massive stars ; i.e. , that from the original woosley and weaver paper and that reduced by a factor of 2 ; the latter is rather recommended by timmes et al .",
    "+  samland s ( 1998 ) model is based also on woosley and weaver s ( 1995 ) yields .",
    "however , since he adjusted the metallicity - dependent na yield in his own way [ cf . equation ( 9 ) therein ] so as to fit the observed trend of [ na / fe ] known at the time of mid-1990 s ( i.e. , erroneously overestimated to be [ na / fe]@xmath149 even for halo stars ) , his prediction does not fit the observed [ na / fe ] obtained in this study .",
    "+  goswami and prantzos s ( 2000 ) calculation ( labeled `` gp(var)''in figure 7 ) explains the decline of [ na / fe ] from [ fe / h]@xmath16 to [ fe / h]@xmath8 reasonably well .",
    "however , their prediction suggests an ever - decreasing ( or a plateau - like ) [ na / fe ] toward the extremely low metallicity regime ( [ na / fe]@xmath13 ) , which apparently contradicts the tendency we found . while their model is based on woosley and weaver s ( 1995 ) metallicity - dependent yields ( as was done by timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) with a fe yield reduced by a factor of 2 , they used a different imf ( kroupa et al .",
    "1993 ) and a different halo model . from this point",
    "of view , the dynamical model of the galaxy and imf adopted by timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) might be preferable to those of goswami and prantzos ( 2000 ) , as far as the early galaxy ( [ fe / h ] @xmath170 ) is concerned .",
    "we carried out extensive non - lte calculations on the atomic model of neutral sodium and model atmospheres with a wide range of parameters , for the purpose of non - lte abundance determinations based on eight representative na  i lines at 5683 , 5688 , 5890 , 5896 , 6154 , 6161 , 8183 , and 8195  @xmath65 .",
    "the non - lte effect almost always acts as a line - strengthening mechanism ( thus the non - lte abundance correction being negative ) . though its extent differs from line to line ( from almost negligible level of a few hundredths dex to a considerable amount of @xmath171 dex ) , strong saturated lines ( though not too strong to be damping - dominated ) tend to suffer a large non - lte effect . generally speaking ,",
    "the lines for which non - lte corrections had better be taken into account in na abundance determinations are 5890/5896 and 8183/8195 lines , while the 5683/5688 and ( especially ) 6154/6161 lines are comparatively less sensitive to a non - lte effect .",
    "our non - lte reanalyzes of our bao and oao equivalent - width data along with those taken from extensive literature revealed the following conclusions : +  ( 1 ) regarding the disk stars with @xmath147 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 , we confirmed the existence of a delicate `` upturn '' feature ( i.e. , broad / shallow dip around the minimum at [ fe / h ] @xmath150 ) superposed on the general tendency of [ na / fe ] @xmath149 , as has been reported by recent analyses on weak na  i 6154/6161 lines being inert to any non - lte effect .",
    "moreover , according to our analyses on our bao data , even the abundances derived from strong ( saturated or damping - dominated ) lines , which are generally unsuitable for abundance analyses , suggested this tendency .",
    "+  ( 2 ) we found based on our analyses of recent data after 1990 s that the [ na / fe ] ratios for metal - poor halo stars show a `` subsolar '' behavior ; i.e. , [ na / fe ] decreases from @xmath149 ( at [ fe / h]@xmath16 ) to @xmath6 ( at [ fe / h]@xmath8 ) , while it appears to rise again with a further decrease in metallicity toward recovering [ na / fe]@xmath149 again at [ fe / h]@xmath13 . it is evident that the previous suggestion of almost solar na - to - fe ratio over all metallicity , which was actually believed until mid 1990 s , is attributed to the overestimation of sodium abundances due to the neglect of non - lte effects . among the representative theoretical models of galactic chemical evolution , that of timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) appears to reasonably reproduce this behavior .",
    "+  ( 3 ) given this observational evidence , the run of [ na / fe ] is in rough accord with that of [ al / fe ] ( cf .",
    "baumller , gehren 1997 ) , which would be a sound consequence from a theoretical point of view , since both are expected to show similar behaviors ( see , e.g. , subsection 5.8 of samland 1998 ) .",
    "in order to further clarify the connection between the present results and the abundances of such important na - related elements in metal - poor stars , we are now planning to carry out extensive non - lte analyses on al and mg , in the way similar to that adopted in this paper by using our own as well as the literature data , the results of which will be reported in our forthcoming papers .",
    "we thank the staff members of oao , especially h. izumiura and s. masuda , for their kind support and suggestions concerning the operation and maintenance of hides .",
    "thanks are also due to s. honda , k. sadakane , s. sato , and k. osada for their helpful collaborations in our 20012002 observations at oao .",
