    "an intensive discussion about the possible relationship between the central properties and their host galaxies was spurred on especially since the high resolution hst photometry and several ground - based ccd photometries of early type galaxies .",
    "although there are significant scatters , a linear mass correlation of central black holes and their host spheroids has still a high probability .",
    "the theoretical interpretation for such linear scale is discussed by several authors ( merritt 1998 , silk & rees 1998 , wang & biermann 1998 ) .",
    "considering various observations , wang & biermann ( 1998 ) proposed a possible formation scenario for elliptical and bulge - dominated galaxies , as well as the consequential active evolution phase where early type galaxies are the products of major mergers between two comparable disk galaxies ; the violent collision between two galaxies could destroy the original stellar disks and form the spheroidal component of merging galaxies after the relaxation ; help to release the angular moment of the cold gas outside and drive them inwards ; a central starburst and qso accretion in the central condensed gas disk will compete for the gas supply , feedback and drain the gas in the disk in a short time ; possibly grow a supermassive black hole during the spheroid formation , blow up the gas left probably by the nuclear wind when the central engine gets to be powerful enough ; thus restrict the central black hole mass and the mass of the stellar component to a ratio of @xmath2 .",
    "the numerical simulation by wang & biermann ( 1998 ) shows the star formation approximately scales with the nuclear accretion during galaxy interactions , which can regulate the black hole to bulge mass ratio to the observed level @xmath0 within a factor of three . in this scenario ,",
    "a quasar black hole is possibly formed at a cosmic time scale of @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath4 in a flat einstein - de sitter world model with @xmath5 .",
    "afterwards , when the quasar active phase has ceased and the spheroidal stellar system gets relaxed in a comparable relaxation time scale , an elliptical or spiral bulge harboring a massive black hole in the center with the mass in a factor @xmath2 of the host spheroid may appear in the universe .",
    "we should mention the black hole evolution in this model is assumed to reach the eddington accretion rate whenever there is sufficient gas supplied to the center .",
    "the question of whether this mass correlation is universal for all agns , i.e. whether seyfert galaxies follow a similar black hole to bulge mass correlation as in early type galaxies and luminous qsos , is not only important for the understanding of the correlation between the host galaxies and the evolution of active nuclei , but for the relation of the formation and evolution scheme between seyferts and qsos .",
    "recent reverberation mapping of a sample of seyferts with reliable central masses and the bulge magnitudes by wandel ( 1999 ) , suggests that there is a broad distribution of black hole to bulge mass ratio with a mean of @xmath1 , about one magnitude lower than the value in early type galaxies and bright qsos .",
    "although this discrepancy may in part be explained by systematic errors and selection or orientation effects ( wandel 2000 ) , a significant difference probably remains , in particular between seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos , at least a large dispersion for the medium - bulge system , with masses similar to those of seyferts ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , richstone et al .",
    "1998 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "our purpose is to firstly present a model which could explain the black hole to bulge mass correlation in agns and the dependence on the environmental parameters of the host galaxies , such as the gas or stellar velocity dispersion , as well as the relation of the central starburst and accretion process during galactic interaction ; secondly , discuss the dispersion of black hole to bulge mass ratio in qsos and seyferts within a simple unified formation scheme , where the bulge formation and nuclear activity are triggered by galaxy mergers or tidal interactions .",
    "we found the variation of the velocity dispersion of accreting gas could cause a range of distribution for the mass ratio , leading to a correlation of the nuclear black hole mass and the gas velocity dispersion roughly as @xmath6 from our simulation , within the slope suggested by recent work of ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) and gebhardt et al .",
    "agns are usually thought to be powered by gas accretion to the central massive black holes .",
    "there is now firm evidence that qsos could be formed during the violent galactic interactions together with central starbursts ( sanders et al .",
    "1988a , 1998b , taniguchi & shioya 1998 , heckman et al .",
    "1986 , bahcall et al .",
    "although only @xmath7 of seyfert galaxies have companions , there are still many aspects of observations which support a simple unified formation scheme for qsos and seyferts ( rafanelli et al .",
    "1995 , taniguchi 1999 ) . in this sense , qsos and seyferts are the consequences of either galaxy mergers or tidal interactions , meanwhile a massive black hole may grow during the process of mergers or tidal interactions since the enhanced cloud - cloud collision or star formation could increase the mass inflow to the center .",
    "we adopt such a unified formation scheme for seyferts where we think the tidal perturbation of some satellites not only kinematically heat and thicken the host disks , form the central bulge , but may increase the effect of self - gravity in the molecular disk , enhance the cloud - cloud collision and star formation , thus result in a considerable mass inflow to the central region on a relatively short time ( lin et al .",
    "1988 , quinn et al .",
    "1993 , walker et al .",
    "1996 , velquez & white 1999 ) .",
    "although we consider in our model the tidal interactions as a formation scheme for most seyferts , we do not reject a possibility that some of agns with low black hole to bulge mass ratio could still be major mergers , but at the earlier evolutionary phase in which the black holes have not had time to reach the asymptotic value .",
    "we adopt @xmath8 as the initial mass distribution for protogalaxies in our model , with the typical mass of @xmath9 and the disk scale of @xmath10 , similar as the size of our galaxy .",
    "the evolution of the surface density @xmath11 of a differentially rotating disk with angular velocity @xmath12 and viscosity @xmath13 is governed by ( lst 1952 , pringle 1981 ) @xmath14^{-1 } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\left ( \\nu \\sigma r^3 \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial r}\\right ) \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\   -\\frac{\\sigma}{t_{\\ast}}\\left(1-r_{\\rm e } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 for a keplerian selfgravitating disk ( duschl et al .",

    "@xmath18 is the star formation rate in the disk with mass return rate @xmath19 ( tinsley 1974 ) . in this case , the mass influx at the inner boundary @xmath20 is :    @xmath21_{r_{\\rm in}}=2\\pi\\beta_{1}v_{0}\\sigma_{0}r_{0}\\ ] ]    we adopt @xmath22 for a flat rotation law for the protogalaxies in our calculation with @xmath23 as a normalization velocity .",
    "the justification of such simplification for a self - gravitating disk at parsec to kiloparsec region is discussed in detail by wang & biermann ( 1998 ) .",
    "the spheroidal bondi accretion rate is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the bondi accretion radius defined as @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the mass of the central black hole ; @xmath28 the effective relative velocity between seed black hole and the ambient gas ) ( bondi 1952 ) . in our model , we start from a tiny black hole @xmath29 , with the inner boundary of the accretion disk @xmath30 which is usually thought to be the inner edge of a torus . changing the scale of inner boundary or the seed black hole mass only influences the early evolution , but no significant effect on the final result . at early time ,",
    "@xmath31 , we assume the mass shears inwards at the inner radius to form a uniform bondi flow with the mass distribution @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the time step of the calculation ) ; afterwards , black hole would grow and reach a stage of @xmath34 , we assume in this case black hole accretes the mass shearing inwards within its influence at @xmath25 via a uniform bondi flow with the mass distribution @xmath35 .    the bondi parameter is assumed to be @xmath36 in our calculation as a possible reduction factor due to the angular momentum .",
    "thus the accretion rate @xmath37 and the star formation rate @xmath38 in a time step @xmath33 is given by : @xmath39    @xmath40    we could roughly estimate the black hole to bulge mass ratio by @xmath41 , where we take the value of @xmath42 in case of @xmath43 . the estimated ratio shows a strong dependence on the velocity dispersion @xmath28 , the value @xmath44 and the black hole mass @xmath27 .    from eq .",
    "( [ arate ] ) , we know the accretion rate @xmath45 when @xmath34 , which indicates that the nuclear activity would dim slowly as the central black hole becomes massive enough . in this case",
    ", a critical black hole mass would be reached when the nuclear accretion rate decreases to a level below eddington rate @xmath46 in units of @xmath47 .",
    "assuming @xmath48 , we get the critical black hole mass @xmath49 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 corresponding to the viscous diffuse time scale of @xmath3 ( we will discuss these particular parameters later ) .",
    "afterwards , the accretion rate would decrease quickly to be much less than eddington rate , and the black hole will not grow significantly .",
    "we say this is an upper limit , simply because we use the initial surface gas density @xmath52 throughout the estimation .",
    "actually , the gas would be depleted during the evolution by star formation and accretion etc .",
    ", it would thus take a time scale much longer than hubble time in order to approch such a mass or maybe never could reach such a level if there is no external trigger for the nuclear accretion , such as galaxy mergers or tidal effects . in any sense",
    ", the black hole growth would be locked up in a level of @xmath53 in such an evolutionary scheme .",
    "meanwhile , we assume in our model @xmath54 , since the result of numerical simulation by wang & biermann ( 1998 ) shows a strong correlation between the starburst and accretion in merging galaxies , which could regulate the black hole to bulge mass ratio to a level @xmath0 within a factor of three in qsos and early type galaxies . in this case ,",
    "if we consider seyferts and qsos are formed in a similar scheme , we could adopt this result as a reasonable assumption for our present model .",
    "we now use as input the critical black hole mass @xmath49 , the assumption @xmath55 and @xmath50 to eq .",
    "( [ arate ] ) , a mass ratio about 0.001 would be approched . choosing @xmath56 is based on the observations by zylka et al .",
    "( 1990 ) of molecular line emission in the central region of our galaxy with the assumption that the velocity field of molecular clouds would be the low limit of the sound speed of hot gas ( linden et al .",

    "( [ arate ] ) and the numerical calculation , the variation of the velocity dispersion of accreting gas , @xmath28 , would cause a broad distribution of black hole to bulge mass ratio , which is actually shown by the observations .",
    "the ratio could reach @xmath57 when @xmath58 , close to the virial velocity of the system . in this case ,",
    "the black hole evolution would follow eddington accretion for a longer time , resulting in a qso phase finally . we should mention here the range ( @xmath59 ) is a crude upper limit , since we could not include the surface density evolution by star formation and accretion in this estimation .",
    "the practical values should be given by numerical simulation shown in fig .",

    "this choice of boundary conditions guarantees zero viscous coupling between the disk and the central object , allows all mass reaching the inner boundary to flow freely inward .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ bondi - bh ] , where we model the effects of a tidal perturbation in a few kpc region by increasing the viscous friction .",
    "in fact , the numerical simulation by lin et al .",
    "( 1988 ) demonstrated that a tidal disturbance could propagate to the nucleus from a distance of a few kpc on a time scale shorter than the tidal interaction by `` swing amplication '' , which induces a rapid increase in the effective viscosity and results in an increase in the rate of mass transfer and energy dissipation .",
    "we adopted in the calculation a reasonable set of parameters which could match the observations quite well .",
    "the viscous diffuse time scale is @xmath71 in case of a tidal perburbation according to the numerical result of lin et al .",
    "we consider the tidal perturbation would enhance cloud - cloud collision , thus increase both star formation and accretion in a self - gravitation disk .",
    "according to the numerical results of wang & biermann ( 1998 ) for the qso evolution , we adopt the assumption @xmath55 ( i.e. the star formation approximately scales with the accretion ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath72 , corresponding to a star formation rate @xmath73 in the central disk , which is at a reasonable level for the observed star formation rate in seyferts .",
    "the initial seed black hole in our model is tiny , @xmath29 .",
    "we know from the calculation that the black hole grows by a rate @xmath74 at the beginning till @xmath75 ; afterwards , the accretion rate would decrease by @xmath76 and only a mediate black hole of @xmath77 can be formed if there is no external trigger . in this case , a tidal perturbation around @xmath78 could help to grow a massive black hole , which corresponds to @xmath79 in an einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath80 ( where we think the tidal interactions happen frequently , also could be a peak of seyfert activities ) .",
    "[ bondi - bh ]    although the parameters , such as initial black hole mass , the inner boundary of the accretion disk etc .",
    "could have certain influence on the mass ratio , we notice from the numerical results and the illustrative estimation that velocity dispersion of the accreting gas is another key parameter besides the value of @xmath81 , which could cause a large dispersion of the black hole to bulge mass ratio in agns .",
    "[ bondi - bh ] shows a correlation between the nuclear black hole to bulge mass ratio and the velocity dispersion of accreting gas to the center from our simulation , which gives a rough proportionality of @xmath82 . in our model",
    ", we are aiming to explain a broad distribution of black hole to bulge mass ratio of a similar bulge system in qsos and seyferts .",
    "if we adopt the masses of the spheroidal systems scale with their luminosities as @xmath83 and the scale length @xmath84 , combining with the virial theorem gives the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath85 ( faber & jackson 1976 , faber et al .",
    "1987 , peterson 1997 ) .",
    "so , we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "the assumption that the velocity dispersion of accreting gas is systematically proportional to the bulge velocity dispersion gives a correlation of @xmath87 , which is shallower than the slope of @xmath88 given by ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) , but steeper than the best - fit correlation ( @xmath89 ) by gebhardt et al .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ bondi - bh ] that the variation of the velocity dispersion of accreting gas would cause a broad distribution of black hole to bulge mass correlation , where the accreting gas with higher velocity dispersion close to the bulge velocity dispersion could lead to an accretion near eddington limit , and form more massive black holes in qsos than in seyferts of similar bulges .",
    "therefore , the black hole to bulge mass correlation in massive systems is close to an upper limit and much tighter than that in medium - bulges .",
    "the physical interpretation of such discrepancy could be due to the different formation or evolution environment of the two kinds of systems ( seyferts and qsos ) .",
    "the violent collision between two galaxies could trigger intense starburst in the center , heat or shock the interstellar medium efficiently than tidal interaction , thus drive a bondi flow fuelling the central black hole with probably a higher sound speed and result in a higher accretion rate . in this case",
    ", it may enhance a qso evolution with the accretion rate close to eddington limit , form a massive black hole , and lead to a black hole to bulge mass ratio higher than in case of seyferts .",
    "recent reverberation mapping of a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies by wandel ( 1999 ) suggests that the black hole to bulge mass correlation in seyferts has a significant dispersion with a mean value of @xmath1 , which is about one magnitude lower than in case of qsos . considering a simple unified formation scheme for agns",
    ", we demonstrated a possible black hole evolution scheme where we assume black hole accretes gas coming within its influence by a uniform bondi flow .",
    "this scenario could interpret not only the statistical mass correlation in agns and normal galaxies , but a large dispersion of the black hole to bulge mass ratio in qsos and seyferts .",
    "we found the black hole to bulge mass correlation in such evolution scheme strongly depends on the velocity dispersion of the accreting gas , which might be an important environmental parameter for the observed correlation besides the relation between the star formation and accretion in the central accretion disk during galaxy interactions ( wang & biermann 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the results of wang & biermann ( 1998 ) represent a limiting case for the black hole evolution in agn , where the accretion is close to eddington rate . the black hole to bulge mass ratio versus velocity dispersion of accreting gas to the central region",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ bondi - bh ] , which gives a rough proportionality of @xmath90 for a fixed bulge system in our model .",
    "if we consider a relation of bulge mass with the galaxy velocity dispersion in the virial equilibrium ( @xmath86 ) , we could estimate a correlation of the nuclear black hole mass with the velocity dispersion of the accreting gas as @xmath6 , within the slope suggested by recent work of ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) and gebhardt et al .",
    "the square and the star in fig .",

    "we present a possible interpretation for such scenario , where we think the intense starburst during violent mergers could heat or shock the interstellar medium ( ism ) to a higher sound speed more efficiently than by tidal interactions , result in a higher accretion rate close to eddington limit and a higher black hole to bulge mass ratio finally in qsos and early type galaxies than in case of seyferts .",
