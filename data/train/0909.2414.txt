    "as is well known , charge carriers ( electrons and holes ) is ionic crystals interact with polar optical phonons and they are self - trapped at their sufficiently strong coupling to the phonons with the formation of optical polarons ( called as the pekar or frhlich polarons ) @xcite .",
    "one distinguishes three distinct regimes of electron - phonon coupling @xcite : ( i ) the weak - coupling regime describes the correlated motions of the lattice atoms and the quasi - free charge carriers which remain in their initial extended state , ( ii ) the intermediate - coupling regime characterizes the self - trapping of a charge carrier which is bound within a potential well produced by the polarization of the lattice in the presence of the carrier and follows the atomic motions , and ( iii ) the strong - coupling regime describes the other condition of self - trapping under which the lattice atoms no longer follow the charge carrier motion and the self - trapping of carriers is usually treated within the adiabatic approximation ( i.e. lattice atoms remain at their fixed positions ) . under certain conditions , two charge carriers interacting with the lattice vibrations and with each other",
    "can form a bound state of two carriers in polar materials within a common self - trapping well . since the attractive interaction of the electron - phonon coupling in these systems is strong enough to overcome the coulomb repulsion between two carriers .",
    "the self - trapped state of the pair of charge carriers is termed a bipolaron . in the last few decades",
    ", the bipolaron problem has been a focus of attention due to its importance in semiconductor technology and in the bipolaronic mechanism of superconductivity ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . after the discovery of the layered high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors , the study of bipolarons has attracted the revived interest because some researchers believe that the bipolaron is one of the possible candidate for explaining high-@xmath6 superconductivity .",
    "the mechanism of high-@xmath6 superconductivity of large bipolarons was proposed by emin and hillary @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is based on the bose - einstein condensation of bipolarons as discussed by schafroth @xcite .",
    "another mechanism of high-@xmath6 superconductivity driven by the superfluid single particle and pair condensation of large bipolarons and polaron cooper pairs was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of such a novel superconductivity depends on the existence of polaron and bipolarons in the superconducting materials .",
    "the above electron - phonon coupling regimes are characterized by the dimensionless frhlich coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the possible ranges of the values of @xmath0 characterizing the weak , intermediate and strong coupling regimes depend on the type of self - trapped charge carriers and the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the polaron and bipolaron ground state in the strong coupling limit ( i.e. in the adiabatic approximation ) have been studied by many authors for 3d and 2d systems @xcite . however , with decreasing @xmath0 , it is necessary to take into account the electron - phonon correlation which reduces the energies of the polaron and bipolaron in comparison with those of the adiabatic polaron and bipolaron .",
    "therefore , a quantitative treatment of the ( bi)polaron problem in the intermediate - coupling regime was also a subject of numerous studies in the past three decades ( see refs @xcite ) .",
    "the ground state energies of the polaron and bipolaron have been calculated by using several approximations , such as the feynman path integral method @xcite , the lee - low - pines ( llp ) unitary transformation method @xcite and the operator formalism @xcite . according to different intermediate coupling treatments ,",
    "the formation of the polaron and bipolaron becomes possible only if the values of @xmath0 are greater than the certain critical values @xmath7 .",
    "the previous calculations have shown that the ( bi)polaron is created more easily in 2d systems than in 3d ones and the stability region for bipolaron formation is much broader in 2d case as compared with 3d case .",
    "so far , calculations of the ground - state energies of the ( bi)polaron , the values of @xmath7 and the stability region of the bipolaron are not conclusive .",
    "some of the estimated values of @xmath8 differ greatly in magnitude .",
    "further , the calculation methods used to study the ( bi)polaron problem suffer from the certain drawbacks ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , the feynman path integral method is more accurate for the calculation of the polaron energy @xcite , but it fails to describe correctly the bipolaron formation .",
    "moreover , the functional for the bipolaron energy has rather a cumbersome form which requires the tedious numerical calculations .",
    "therefore , it is expedient to use the another method for the calculation of the polaron and bipolaron energies in the intermediate - coupling regime .",
    "one of such methods is the buimistrov - pekar method @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the electron - phonon correlation is taken into account through the displacement amplitude @xmath9 of the form : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the variational parameters , which are determined from the condition for minima of the total energy , @xmath13 is the electron coordinate , @xmath14 is the phonon wave vector .    the second term in eq .",
    "( [ 1eq ] ) takes into account the electron - phonon correlation effect that leads to the reduction of the energy of a 3d adiabatic polaron when @xmath15 . at @xmath16",
    "the present method leads to the delocalized state of a polaron , and the total energy of the polaron is given by @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon frequency ) . in the feynman path",
    "integral variational approach @xcite , the delocalization of the polaron at a finite value of @xmath0 does not occur and the lowest polaron energy is obtained .",
    "however , at @xmath15 the buimistrov - pekar method taking into account an important part of the electron - phonon correlation gives also reasonable results for the energy of the polaron .",
    "the main advantage with this method is that it is simple and does not require tedious numerical calculations .",
    "recently , the buimistrov - pekar method was applied to study both the free bipolaron and the bound bipolaron in 3d systems @xcite .",
    "the existence of polarons and bipolarons in high-@xmath6 cuprates and other materials has been indicated by several experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19-based layered high-@xmath5 materials are believed to be quasi - two - dimensional systems and in an intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime .",
    "so far , the problems of the 2d polaron and bipolaron are not studied sufficiently and the possibility of formation of intermediate - coupling polarons and bipolarons in 2d systems within the buimistrov - pekar formalism is not explored .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the formation of the intermediate coupling optical polaron and bipolaron in 2d systems by using the buimistrov - pekar method and to expose the important features of this method .",
    "we calculate the ground - state energies of the intermediate coupling 2d ( bi)polarons , the critical values of @xmath0 , the parameter of the coulomb repulsion between two carriers @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the high frequency and static dielectric constants ) for the formation of 2d polaron and bipolaron .",
    "we discuss the obtained results and compare them with previous ones obtained by using the feynman path integral method and the modified llp unitary transformation method @xcite .",
