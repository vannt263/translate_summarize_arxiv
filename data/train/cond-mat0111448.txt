    "in a recent paper carbotte _ et al._@xcite showed that the @xmath3mev spin resonance observed in spin polarized neutron scattering experiments@xcite on yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath4 ( ybco ) has a counterpart in the infrared optical conductivity in which an optical resonance is seen at the same energy demonstrating its coupling to the charge carriers.@xcite the temperature evolution of the spin resonance can be determined from consideration of the frequency dependence of the optical scattering rate measured at several different temperatures@xcite in the superconducting state . the required analysis which allows one to extract the resonance from the optics",
    "is carried out within a generalized eliashberg formalism for a @xmath5-wave superconductor.@xcite the end result is a charge carrier - exchange boson excitation spectral density which characterizes the inelastic scattering .",
    "the spectral density @xmath6 shows a distinct evolution with decreasing temperature . at @xmath7",
    "the spectrum obtained is linear in @xmath8 at small @xmath8 , followed by broad peak at some characteristic energy @xmath9 and then there is a very slow decay at higher @xmath8 extending up to a cutoff @xmath10 of order @xmath11mev .",
    "this spectrum can be fit with the spin fluctuation form employed in pines group@xcite @xmath12 ( mmp model ) , where @xmath13 is a coupling constant to the charge carriers .",
    "as the temperature is lowered below @xmath7 , the fluctuation spectrum obtained from the infrared data undergoes important changes .",
    "it develops a gap at the lowest energies as well as a peak at @xmath3mev .",
    "the strength of this peak tracks well the observed growth of the area under the spin susceptibility , @xmath14 at @xmath15 , measured by dai _",
    "et al._@xcite in neutron scattering",
    ". the higher energy part , however , remains largely unaffected .",
    "the observed changes in spectral density are as expected and are interpreted as coming from feedback effects on the excitation spectrum due to the changes brought about in the electronic system by the onset of superconductivity .",
    "this arises in any purely electronic mechanism of superconductivity in which the pairing proceeds through bosons exchanged between the charge carriers and where the bosons themselves are intrinsic to the electronic system.@xcite the changes in the low energy part of @xmath6 lead directly to the phenomenon referred to as the collapse of the quasiparticle scattering rate and is responsible for the freezing out of the inelastic scattering at low temperatures . in turn",
    ", this leads to a prominent peak around @xmath16k in the in - plane microwave conductivity@xcite as a function of temperature @xmath17 and a corresponding peak in the electronic thermal conductivity.@xcite    schachinger _",
    "et al._@xcite have recently found that this same spectral density @xmath6 also gives , within an eliashberg formalism , good agreement with observed properties of the superconducting state such as the ratio of the gap to the critical temperature , the fractional optical spectral weight involved in the condensation ( superfluid stiffness ) , the temperature dependence of the penetration depth , the magnitude of the condensation energy , as well as other quantities .",
    "it is also obvious from the way the temperature dependent spectral density has been derived in ref .  5 that the coupling to the @xmath3mev spin resonance in ybco can not play the role of the ` glue ' leading to superconductivity@xcite because it is absent at @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we consider the temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity for five different frequencies between 1 and @xmath18ghz observed recently@xcite in ultra pure samples of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 grown in bazno@xmath1 crucibles .",
    "our calculations are based on the previously determined spectral density @xmath6 for twinned ybco single crystals which is not modified in any way .",
    "it is found , however , that to understand the low temperature data ( @xmath19k ) it is necessary to additionally introduce some elastic impurity scattering .",
    "a model impurity potential intermediate between weak ( born ) and strong ( unitary ) scattering is developed which provides a reasonable , if not perfect overall fit to the data .    in sec .",

    "these equations involve two channels . the ordinary renormalization channel which remains in the normal state and leads to renormalization of the matsubara frequencies by the interactions .",

    "the inset in the top right hand shows this on a different scale and allows the reader to better see the radical difference in behavior between born and unitary limit .",
    "although , neither of these limits show a drude variation with @xmath8 , we can still think of the half width of each curve as giving a measure of the underlying quasiparticle scattering rate .",

    "this holds even when inelastic scattering is included .",
    "the calculations show clearly that , on the hold , the main features of the microwave data can be understood within the same generalized eliashberg formalism that has recently been so successful in describing many of the anomalous superconducting state properties@xcite seen in the oxides .",
    "this follows also from the observation by schachinger and carbotte@xcite that adding elastic impurity scattering only affects the low energy region of the optical properties while the inelastic scattering effects are seen in the energy region @xmath125 .",
