    "young stellar systems exhibit excess infrared and millimeter emission that arises primarily from circumstellar dust in two basic evolutionary structures : envelopes and disks .",
    "current observations and theories of star formation ( e.g. larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ; shu 1977 ; cassen & moosman 1981 ; lada & wilking 1984 ; adams , lada , & shu 1987 ; shu et al .",
    "1993 ; andr , ward - thompson , & barsony 1993 ) outline an evolutionary sequence that begins with a density enhancement which quasi - statically contracts to form a centrally concentrated core .",
    "the core then gravitationally collapses forming an infall region which feeds a central protostar and a surrounding disk supported by centrifugal forces .",
    "initially , the envelope ( radii of 1000s of au ) contains most of the mass , but as the system evolves , the disk and protostar grow , and the disk becomes a significant mass reservoir . in time , the prenatal envelope is depleted of material and progressively blown away by the powerful stellar outflow , revealing the young star and disk ( radii of @xmath7  100 au ) system .",
    "detailed modeling of young stellar objects has shown that the infrared through millimeter wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be reproduced by thermal dust emission from a combination of a large - scale envelope , spatially thin disk , and central star ( adams , lada , & shu 1987 ; kenyon & hartmann 1987 ; bertout , basri , & bouvier 1988 ; calvet , hartmann , & whitney 1994 ) or , in some cases , by just a disk and central star ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; osterloh & beckwith 1995 ; dutrey et al . 1996 ) .",
    "surveys of main - sequence stellar systems find that most stars are in binary or multiple systems ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) with the separation distribution ranging from a few @xmath8 to 10@xmath9 au and the probability distribution peaking around 30 au .",
    "recent surveys of the nearby star - forming regions of taurus and ophiuchus find that the occurrence of binaries in the young visible systems is about twice as common as among main - sequence stars ( simon et al .",
    "1992 ; ghez , neugebauer , & , matthews 1993 ; leinert et al .",
    "1993 ; reipurth & zinnecker 1993 ; ghez , white , & simon 1997 ) .",
    "how is the above star formation process altered to form binary systems , and how does the younger , deeply embedded systems binary occurrence compare to the young visible systems ?    in this paper , we present a @xmath0  =  2.7  mm continuum survey of 24 nearby young stellar objects that represent a sample of young stellar systems at various stages of evolution .",
    "the survey highlights the large dynamic range of spacings available with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) millimeter array covering both the largest and smallest spacings currently available at @xmath0  =  2.7  mm . with a combination of low and high resolutions , we are able to map the envelopes of the embedded sources and resolve - out the large - scale structure in order to peer inside the envelopes and image the central regions . with the highest angular resolution to date at this wavelength , we are able to image circumstellar disks ( e.g. mundy et al .",
    "1996 ) and search for close binaries ( e.g. looney , mundy , & welch 1997 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present our images with the discussion focusing on differences and similarities between the various evolutionary stages and several broad trends in the data . in additional papers",
    ", we will discuss individual sources in detail and extensively model the emission structures of these sources as arising from extended envelopes , circumstellar disks , and circumbinary disks .",
    "the goal of the survey was to image a range of young stellar systems at sub - arcsecond resolution .",
    "we concentrated on bright , nearby sources which were most likely to produce high dynamic range images .",
    "the criteria for selecting the sample were : ( 1 ) for the best sensitivity to solar - system - sized spatial scales , we focused on the closest sources ( @xmath6 350 pc ) ; ( 2 ) to insure sufficient surface brightness at sub - arcsecond resolution , we chose among the brightest sources in the nearby star forming regions ; ( 3 ) to survey a number of evolutionary stages , our sample included the youngest , most deeply embedded sources ( class 0 ) , as well as optical t tauri stars ( class i / ii ) ; ( 4 ) finally , to achieve the best map fidelity , we required that the sources have both a bright phase reference calibrator and a weaker point source response calibrator nearby on the sky .",
    "this combination of criteria introduces three strong biases in our sample : ( a ) we favor bright millimeter sources which should be systems with more circumstellar material than average ( e.g. beckwith et al . 1990 ) , ( b ) most of our sources are either class 0 or class ii ( this is mostly due to the bias above ) , and ( c ) as a result of our distance limit , our sources are drawn from just three local clouds taurus , ophiuchus , and perseus .",
    "table 1 lists the sources , adopted distances , whether they are optically visible ( in this category we also include objects which are visible in the near - infrared ) or embedded , adopted sed class , main calibrator , secondary calibrator , and distance reference .",
    "the distance to the perseus objects has been in dispute lately , 350 pc ( herbig & jones 1983 ) and more recently 220 pc ( cernis 1990 ) .",
    "we adopt the previous value , allowing an easier comparison to earlier works .",
    "the frequency of multiple systems will be addressed in  6 , but the number of objects in the embedded source group is misleading since all of the observed embedded sources are in multiple systems .",
    "for example , the perseus objects include 13 sources which were mapped in only 4 pointings , whereas in the optical group , only dg tauri and dg tauri b ( which is an embedded object not thought to be related to dg tauri except by projected proximity ; jones & cohen 1986 ) were mapped in the same observation .",
    "all sources were observed in three configurations ( c , b , and a ) of the 9-element bima array(welch et al .",
    "the observations were acquired from 1996 may to 1998 march .",
    "the digital correlator was configured with two 700  mhz bands centered at 106.04  ghz and 109.45  ghz .",
    "the c@xmath10o(1 - 0 ) line was observed simultaneously ; those results will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the two continuum bands were checked for consistency , then combined in the final images .",
    "the system temperatures during the observations ranged from 150 - 700 k ( ssb ) .    in the compact c array ( typical synthesized beam of @xmath78@xmath2 ) ,",
    "the shortest baselines were limited by the antenna size of 6.1  m , yielding a minimum projected baseline of 2.1  k@xmath0 and good sensitivity to structures as large as @xmath750@xmath2 . in the mid - sized b array ( typical synthesized beam of @xmath72@xmath2 ) , the observations are sensitive to structures as large as @xmath710@xmath2 . in the long baseline a array ( typical synthesized beam of @xmath70@xmath16 ) , the longest baselines were typically 450  k@xmath0 .",
    "the combination of these three arrays provides a well sampled plane from 2.1  k@xmath0 out to 400  k@xmath0 .    the uncertainty in the amplitude calibration is estimated to be 20% . in the b and c arrays , the amplitude calibration was boot - strapped from mars . in the a array , amplitude calibration was done by assuming the flux of the quasar 3c273 to be 18.8 jy at the end of 1996 october , 23.0 jy at the end of 1996 november , and 27.0 jy until the end of 1997 january .",
    "absolute positions in our map have uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the antenna locations and the statistical variation from the signal - to - noise of the observation .",
    "these two factors add in quadrature to give a typical absolute positional uncertainty of @xmath1115 in the highest resolution maps .",
    "the a array observations required careful phase calibration . on long baselines , the interferometer phase is very sensitive to atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "we employed rapid phase referencing ; the observations were switched between source and phase calibrator on a two minute cycle , to follow the atmospheric phase ( holdaway & owen 1995 ; looney , mundy , & welch 1997 ) . to monitor the coherence of the atmosphere , or the `` seeing '' , we included a nearby weaker quasar in the observation cycle .",
    "this quasar was imaged along with the target source as a check of the point source response and for accurate image registration . in the observations presented here ,",
    "the secondary quasar always mapped as a point source within statistical uncertainties .",
    "the observational data span distances from 2.1k@xmath0 to 450k@xmath0 , providing information of the brightness distribution on spatial scales from 0@xmath14 to 60@xmath2 . in order to display this information in the image plane",
    ", we have mapped the emission with four different weighting schemes which stress structures on spatial scales of roughly 5@xmath2 , 3@xmath2 , 1@xmath2 , and 0@xmath12 .",
    "these resolutions were typically obtained with natural weighting , robust weighting ( briggs 1995 ) of 1.0 , robust weighting of 0.0 , and robust weighting of -0.5 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm continuum images from the survey are shown in figures 1 through 16 , first the optical / ir systems and then the deeply embedded systems . in each figure , the four panels display the same multi - configuration data with different weighting schemes to emphasize structures on size scales comparable to the synthesized beam .",
    "table 2 lists , at each resolution , the peak flux , the integrated flux , and the box used to measure the integrated flux .",
    "the error bars on the flux measurements represent the statistical uncertainties .    in figure 17 ,",
    "the source fluxes are presented in a plot comparing the total integrated flux to the ratio of the visibility amplitude at two specific fringe spacings .",
    "the horizontal axis is the integrated flux of each object taken from table 2 and adjusted to the distance of taurus ( 140 pc ) . for the vertical axis",
    ", the data were binned in annuli stretching from 2.2 k@xmath0 to 7.8 k@xmath0 and from 22 k@xmath0 to 78 k@xmath0 , corresponding to average spacings of 5 k@xmath0 and 50 k@xmath0 for the distance of taurus .",
    "the ranges were chosen to provide the best signal to noise for a typical source and the best sensitivity to large and small scale structures .",
    "the vertical axis plots the ratio of the vector averaged amplitudes in the two bins or the 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratio . in order for the ratio to consistently probe the same spatial scales for all objects , we adjusted the bin range to take into account the source distance : for @xmath13 ophiuchi we used annuli averaging of 5.7 k@xmath0 and 57 k@xmath0 , respectively , and for perseus we used annuli averaging 12.5 k@xmath0 and 125 k@xmath0 , respectively . for objects in multiple systems ,",
    "the companion objects were subtracted out of the data using the clean components in the lower resolution ( 5@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 ) maps as a model .",
    "figure 18 illustrates how to interpret figure 17 by comparing the visibility curves of a 5000 au outer radius envelope and a 100 au radius disk , both at the distance of taurus ( 140 pc ) .",
    "this figure is essentially the one - dimensional fourier transform of the brightness distribution of the source on the sky .",
    "the horizontal axis is the spatial frequency of the interferometer , or the antenna separation in units of wavelengths , and the vertical axis is in janskys .",
    "the visibility of the disk model is similar to an unresolved point source until the disk starts to be resolved at @xmath7 60 k@xmath0 . in the case of the envelope",
    ", it is quickly resolved and approaches the expected power - law form ; the `` wiggles '' are due to the sharp outer edge of the model .",
    "overall , the 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratio provides a measure of the relative emission on spatial scales of 2500 - 9000 au and 250 - 900 au and quantitatively measures the `` compactness '' of the object .",
    "an object with spatially extended structure , such as an envelope with size scales of 1000 au or larger will have a 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratio @xmath141 , and an object that is entirely compact , such as a circumstellar disk with radius of @xmath7 100 au , will be essentially unresolved in the two bins and the ratio will be unity .",
    "the general trend of figure 17 is , as expected , that most of the optical sources ( solid triangles ) are compact ( 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratio of @xmath7 1 ) and most of the embedded sources ( solid squares ) are surrounded by envelopes that are being significantly resolved at 50 k@xmath0 ( 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratio @xmath141 ) .",
    "however , there are a couple of exceptions worth discussing . first , there are two optical stars with unusually large 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratios gg tauri and svs13 a. gg tauri is a close binary system with a separation of 0@xmath1255 ( leinert et al .",
    "1991 ) and a large circumbinary disk ( diameter @xmath7 400 au ; simon & guilloteau 1992 ; dutrey , guilloteau , & simon 1994 ) .",
    "thus , in gg tauri the 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratio is resolving the large scale circumbinary disk .",
    "svs13 a , first detected in the infrared at 2.2 @xmath15 m ( strom , grasdalen , & strom 1974 ; strom , vrba , & strom 1976 ) is also know to have optical / infrared outbursts ( eislffel 1991 ) ; yet it has a very large 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratio .",
    "there are two possible explanations : ( 1 ) the envelope of the nearby , younger embedded object svs13 a2 is contributing to the flux of svs13 a1 at 5 k@xmath0 , or ( 2 ) the optical / infrared emission is a reflection nebula and the source should be classified as embedded .",
    "a second set of exceptions are two embedded sources ( ngc 1333 iras2-b and iras4-c ) that have unusually small 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratios .",
    "since these sources are not detected in the optical or the near - infrared they are classified as embedded sources , but their 5k@xmath0/50k@xmath0 ratio and their integrated fluxes in table 2 indicate that they are compact .",
    "these two sources could be optical / near - infrared sources that are viewed through intervening obscuration .",
    "the following subsections discuss each of the sources in more detail .",
    "dg tauri is a well studied classical t tauri star system . through modeling of the system s sed , adams ,",
    "emerson , & fuller ( 1990 ) estimated a radius of 75 au for the circumstellar disk .",
    "the source was observed in the near - infrared during a lunar occultation ( leinert et al .",
    "1991 ) , and it was determined that the star was a single system with an extended `` shell '' 6.8 au in diameter .",
    "in addition , near - infrared speckle observations revealed the presence of a `` halo '' with a diameter of 130 au ( leinert et al .",
    "1991 ) . in panel ( d ) of figure 1 , the circumstellar disk around dg tauri is marginally resolved .",

    "this result is different from the measurement at @xmath0  =  2.0  mm from kitamura , kawabe , & saito ( 1996 ) , which found a deconvolved size of 1@xmath156 @xmath17 0@xmath154 at a principal axis of 99@xmath18 , but similar to the measurement at @xmath0 = 2.7 mm from dutrey et al .",

    "dg tauri b was observed near the half power point of our beam during the observation of dg tauri ; therefore measured fluxes have a significant additional uncertainty .",

    "in fact , the ratio is twice as large as the next highest source l1448 irs3 b. thus , source a has most of its mass in the envelope , perhaps making it one of the younger sources in this survey .",
    "our measurement of the integrated flux from this source is higher than previous observations ( e.g. walker et al .",
    "this is because we have shorter spacing data which pick up the extended structure of the circumbinary envelope better than previous works .",
    "if we remove the shorter spacings , the total integrated flux is @xmath7750 mjy , which is more in agreement with the previous measurements .",
    "there is a striking difference between the embedded objects and the optical / ir objects in our survey .",
    "the optical sources have compact emission on spatial scales of @xmath71@xmath2 with little large - scale envelope emission .",
    "this is illustrated both in figure 17 and by the peak / integrated fluxes in table 2 .",
    "the peak flux does not change significantly , even down to size scales of @xmath71@xmath15 , until the resolution is sufficient to see the circumstellar disk .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the embedded objects which typically have @xmath24 of their emission in large scale structures .",
    "the embedded sources , figures 7 through 16 , show dramatic change in structure as the resolution is varied through the panels .",
    "structures are resolved - out as the shorter spacings are down - weighted in the higher resolution images . at the highest resolution , the embedded objects typically have a residual compact component , but the flux of this component is significantly less than that in large scale extended emission . in addition , the embedded objects often show complex sub - structure within the field .    indeed , it is usually difficult to isolate the circumstellar disk from the envelope in the embedded sources , even at 0@xmath15 resolution . in most cases ,",
    "the emission shows no discontinuity in flux between 1@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 scales ; this indicates that any disk present can not be significantly more massive than the mass of the envelope extended to small scales .",
    "since the embedded sources are typically a factor of two farther away than the optical sources , we can not establish whether the disks in embedded systems are systematically less massive than typical disks around young optical stars .",
    "nonetheless , the younger disks do not appear to be prominent mass reservoirs compared to their envelopes on the few hundred au scale .    however , it is interesting to note that even in the two nearest embedded systems vla 1623 and iras 16293 - 2422 , where our spatial resolution is comparable to the taurus systems , the disk and envelope contributions to the continuum emission are difficult to disentangle . in the vla 1623 system ,",
    "roughly one - third of the total flux is in the large - scale circumbinary envelope , and two - thirds is in the two unresolved components ( @xmath6 160 diameter ) ; each compact component may be a @xmath70.04  circumstellar disk or a combination of an individual circumstellar envelope and a circumstellar disk . in the iras 16293 - 2422 system ,",
    "most of the flux ( @xmath785% ) is in the large scale circumbinary envelope and any disk flux is less than 15% of the total flux , but even here the envelope emission could still be significant fraction of the flux at small scales .",
    "overall , our results generally support a picture in which most embedded systems have disk masses which are comparable to , or less than , the typical disk masses of @xmath70.02   found for young optical stars ( osterloh & beckwith 1995 ) .",
    "most theoretical works find that the disk grows in prominence with time as the system evolves .",
    "cassen & moosman ( 1981 ) showed that the detailed evolution of a disk is very dependent upon the distribution of mass and angular momentum in the original cloud and dissipative processes within the disk . for a range of assumptions",
    ", they found that the disk should grow more massive and larger with time . building upon these results , stahler et al .",
    "( 1994 ) considered a disk with negligible viscosity that was formed as soon as the angular momentum in the infalling material caused it to `` miss '' the protostar .",
    "they found that the radius of the disk is a strong function of time , increasing as @xmath25 .",
    "as the accretion rate onto the star begins to fall off , the mass of the disk increases .",
    "recent results using magnetic collapse models ( basu 1998 ) , predict that the early disk grows less strongly , increasing only linearly with time , but , in these models , the disk starts out more massive since less material can fall directly onto the star .",
    "unfortunately , even higher linear resolution observations than those presented here are needed to fully isolate disks in most embedded systems and test detailed theoretical predictions .",
    "how does the circumstellar mass in the optical systems and embedded systems compare ?",
    "the @xmath0 = 2.7 mm emission provides a measure of circumstellar mass in these systems .",
    "detailed modeling , including data from a variety of wavelengths , is needed to provide the best mass estimates , but the accuracy of any mass estimate is limited by the uncertainty in the dust emissivity and the true structure of the source . since the purpose of this paper is to present a survey",
    ", we will apply a very simple emissivity model , and some assumptions , to make a rough mass estimate for the different systems .",
    "we adopt a single - temperature , optically thin source model so that f@xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the planck function , @xmath28 is the temperature of the dust , @xmath29 is the dust mass opacity , m is the mass of gas and dust , and d is the distance to the source . for the dust temperature , we will assume characteristic temperatures of 35  k for the deeply embedded objects and 60  k for the disk dominated systems . for the dust mass opacity ( beckwith & sargent 1991 ; draine 1990 ; pollack et al .",
    "1994 ; stognienko , henning , & ossenkopf 1995 ) , we adopt a @xmath29 which is consistent with other works ( e.g. beckwith & sargent 1991 ; ohashi et al . 1991 ; osterloh & beckwith 1995 ) : @xmath29 = 0.1(@xmath30/1200 ghz ) @xmath31 g@xmath32 , corresponding to @xmath29 = 0.009 @xmath31 g@xmath32 at @xmath0  =  2.7  mm .",
    "although we do not expect this simple model to give accurate masses , it provides rough estimates that are adequate for qualitative comparisons and are arguably within a factor of 2 of the likely mass .",
    "more detailed modeling of the individual sources will be done in subsequent papers .",
    "table 3 lists the estimated mass for each source , as well as the best fitted positions from the highest resolution image ( typical positional uncertainties of 0@xmath115 ) .",
    "the masses show more than a factor of a hundred range from the least to most massive system in our sample .",
    "where there is overlap , there is reasonable agreement between the simple model and published mass estimates .",
    "for example , the mass for hl tauri in table 3 , 0.05 , is within the range of masses previously found , 0.05 to 0.1   ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; mundy et al .",
    "1996 , wilner , ho , & rodrguez 1996 ; close et al .",

    "1990 ; dutrey et al .",
    "1996 ) . for the embedded systems iras 16293 - 2422 and l1448 irs3 , our estimated masses of 1.1  and 0.74   respectively , are similar to other interferometric estimates , 1  for iras 16293 - 2422 ( e.g. mundy et al . 1992 ) and 0.5  for l1448 irs3 b ( e.g. terebey , chandler , & andr 1993 ) .",
    "the circumstellar masses for the two categories , optical / infrared and deeply embedded sources , follow the expected trend : the embedded objects typically have a factor of 5 or so larger masses . comparing circumstellar masses and stellar masses for the optical sources , as expected ,",
    "these stars have already acquired most of their final mass .",
    "the luminosities of the optical / infrared systems range from @xmath71 to 30 , suggesting central masses of 0.5 to 1.5 , whereas their circumstellar masses in table 3 range from 0.01 to 0.08 .",

    "the luminosities of the embedded systems range from @xmath7 1  for vla 1623 to @xmath7 50  for the ngc 1333 svs 13 system . given the star formation regions in which they are found ( ngc 1333 and ophiuchi ) and their luminosities",
    ", it is likely that the embedded sources are forming a similar range of stellar masses to that of the optical / infrared sources .",
    "thus , the current circumstellar masses are generally comparable to the expected stellar masses .",
    "unfortunately , the current masses of the forming stellar bodies is unknown .",
    "nearly all of the observed systems have outflows , centralized dust heating , and significant luminosities , indicating that a stellar object is present .",
    "the current stellar mass required to generate the observed luminosity can be roughly estimated , if it is assumed that the observed circumstellar mass is accreting on a central object at a constant rate over the typical duration of this phase of 10@xmath33 years . for a stellar radius of 3  r@xmath34 ,",
    "the derived stellar masses are in the range of 0.05  to 0.4 .",
    "this simple approach suggests that the stellar cores in the embedded systems are likely to have already attained a significant fraction ( 10 to 40% ) of their final stellar masses .",
    "all of the embedded sources in our survey are either part of small groupings or are in close binary systems .",
    "even though our sample may be biased due to our selection criteria , binary systems appear to be common in the earliest stages of star formation .",
    "three possible explanations for the large number of embedded binary systems are : ( 1 ) small sample statistics , ( 2 ) selection effects in our sample , such that binary , embedded sources were preferentially chosen , or ( 3 ) true high multiplicity among younger systems ( ghez , neugebauer , & matthews 1993 ) .    on the first point , even though we observed a small number of systems , the probability of choosing six multiple systems from a taurus - like binary fraction distribution of @xmath7  60% ( e.g. ghez , neugebauer , & , matthews 1993 ) is low ( only 4.7% ) but it can not be ruled out . on the second point , one obvious selection bias would be if binary systems typically have more massive envelopes than single star systems , making embedded binary systems brighter at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "this supposition is opposite to the trend seen in older , optical t tauri binaries ; studies of these systems ( beckwith et al . 1990 ; jensen , mathieu , & fuller 1994 , 1996 ; osterloh & beckwith 1995 ) provide statistical evidence that t tauri binary systems have _ less _ millimeter emission than single systems .",
    "however , the emission properties of young binary systems could be time dependent young embedded binary systems could be brighter millimeter sources than coeval single star systems , because they have more massive envelopes . as they evolve , their envelopes disappear and the remaining material is more rapidly processed through their circumstellar disks than in single star systems , and they become less bright at millimeter wavelengths than comparable single star systems .",
    "data on more embedded systems are needed to test this possibility .    on the third point ,",
    "the evolution of binarity among stellar systems is an open question .",
    "our results support the idea that binaries and multiple systems may be more common in younger systems ; however , our criteria for identifying multiple systems is fairly loose",
    ". systems with separations of 5000 au or more are valid pairs for forming stars because the reservoir of cloud material that the forming stars draws from is typically several thousand , or more , au .",
    "but , as such systems evolve , the loss of envelope mass and interactions with other stars forming in the cloud provide mechanisms for unbinding loose binary systems .",
    "the evidence for evolutionary trends in the binarity of optical young stars is contradictory .",
    "speckle observations of the hyades cluster , a young main - sequence cluster , find that the occurrence of binary systems in the cluster is larger than in the local solar neighborhood but less than the taurus clouds ( patience et al .",
    "1998 ) , but studies of additional optical clusters did not confirm the trend of decreasing binary occurrence with age ( patience et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it is also possible that binary formation mechanisms have a dependence on the initial conditions of the pre - collapse cloud ( durisen & sterzik 1994 ) or the density of the star forming cluster ( bouvier , rigaut , & nadeau 1997 ) , so simple comparison of different regions may not be valid .",
    "broader survey work is needed to separate the different possible factors .",
    "the solid result from our work is that multiplicity is common and established early in the formation process and on a variety of scales .",
    "the most favored mechanism for the early formation of binary and multiple stellar systems is fragmentation within either the initial cloud core or the circumstellar disk .",
    "fragmentation during the earliest stages of the isothermal collapse of a cloud core , due to perturbations or non - spherical cores , can form binary systems with separations ranging from 10 to 10@xmath9 au ( boss & bodenheimer 1979 ; monaghan & lattanzio 1986 ; bonnell et al . 1991 ; bonnell & bastien 1992 ; boss 1993 ; bate , bonnell , & price 1995 ) .",
    "fragmentation due to gravitational instabilities in the circumstellar disk systems may form binary systems with separations ranging from 10 @xmath8 to 100 au ( adams , ruden , & shu 1989 ; shu et al .",
    "1990 ; bonnell 1994 ; bonnell & bate 1994 ) . in our survey , the majority of the circumstellar mass in embedded systems is in the large - scale envelope , with very little mass in circumstellar disks .",
    "this would suggest that fragmentation occurs during the early evolution of the core in most systems .",
    "however , the perseus clouds are distant enough that we would not detect close ( @xmath21 150 au separation ) binary systems , the primary regime of the disk fragmentation and the dominate population for optical binary stars . of the optical sources in our survey ,",
    "all of which are located in the taurus cloud , only two appear to be binary systems gg tauri and l1551 irs5 .",
    "both of these sources could have been formed by disk fragmentation since they both have circumbinary structures .",
    "observations with resolution of 10 au , or smaller , are needed to probe the fragmentational history of close binaries .",
    "morphologically , we can identify three types of multiple systems in our sample : separate envelope , common envelope , and common disk systems ( table 4 ) .",
    "the characteristics of the different systems are defined by the broad distribution of the circumstellar material .",
    "separate envelope systems exhibit clearly distinct centers of gravitational concentration with separations of @xmath46000 au ; the components are within a larger surrounding core of low density material .",
    "common envelope systems have one primary core of gravitational concentration which breaks into multiple objects at separations of 100 - 3000 au .",
    "common disk systems have separations of @xmath6 100 au and typically have circumbinary disk - like distributions of material . table 5 lists the binary systems with our classification , their association , and the projected separation .",
    "the association number assigned in table 5 identifies members of common envelope or common disk systems .",
    "there are several clear connections between these morphological distinctions and other works .",
    "the study of the separation distribution of optical binaries by larson ( 1995 ) found a knee in the distribution at 0.04 pc ( 8250 au ) which was identified with the jeans size .",
    "larson suggested that systems on that scale and larger formed by fragmentation and separate collapse , exactly the structure found in the separate envelope systems .",
    "this scenario of prompt initial fragmentation is not new ( e.g. larson 1978 , pringle 1989 , bonnell et al .",
    "1991 ) ; it was discussed recently by bonnell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the context of small cluster formation .",
    "the critical issue is that the collapse is initiated in a system which contains multiple jeans masses in a weakly condensed configuration ; one example of such a system would be a prolate gaussian distribution with several jeans masses along the long axis and one jeans mass across the short axes . in systems with large separations , ambipolar diffusion in self - gravitating , magnetic clouds may play an important role ( e.g. mouschovias 1991 ) .",
    "the common envelope systems can be linked with models for the fragmentation of moderately centrally - condensed spherical systems ( burkert & bodenheimer 1993 ; boss 1995 , boss 1997 ) . in these models",
    ", fragmentation occurs in the dense central region within an overall single core .",
    "the primary requirement for fragmentation is that the central region has a fairly flat distribution .",
    "however , evidence of this flat region is erased quickly once the fragmentation and collapse occurs , and the forming multiple system is left embedded within a single centrally condensed core . finally , the common disk systems are similar to models of high angular momenta systems ( artymowiez & lubow 1994 ; bate & bonnell 1997 ) .",
    "this implies that close stellar systems may be created by fragmentation of early disks or pseudo - disk structures created early in the collapse ( e.g. galli & shu 1993 ) .",
    "the distribution of material between circumstellar and circumbinary structures in such systems , depends sensitively on the angular momentum of the infalling material .",
    "we have presented the first sub - arcsecond millimeter wavelength survey of the dust continuum emission towards 24 young stellar systems .",
    "morphologically , the systems can be divided into young , embedded objects and older optical / infrared sources .",
    "the optical systems show compact emission from circumstellar disks that only begins to be resolved at @xmath71@xmath2 resolution . in two systems , hl tauri and dg tauri",
    ", we resolve the circumstellar disk .",
    "the embedded systems show thermal dust emission that is dominated by their circumstellar envelopes with weak residual emission at small scales .",
    "the embedded systems have @xmath4 85% of their @xmath0  =  2.7  mm continuum emission from large scale structures .",
    "this suggests that young circumstellar disks of the embedded systems are not prominent mass reservoirs compared to the inner circumstellar envelope .",
    "in fact , for most of the embedded systems , there is no obvious discontinuity in flux between 1@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 .",
    "thus , if there are circumstellar disks in these systems , they are not more massive than the expected mass of the power - law envelope extrapolated to small scales .",
    "simple estimates of the circumstellar mass ( not including the star ) in our systems show that the circumstellar mass of the embedded systems ( ranging from 0.04 to 2.9 ) is , as expected , larger than the circumstellar mass of the optical / infrared systems ( 0.01 to 0.08 ) .",
    "typically , the embedded systems have a factor of 5 or so larger circumstellar masses .",
    "this follows the broad trend that the older optical / infrared sources have nearly reached their final stellar mass , since there is little mass left to accrete , and that the younger , embedded sources have not reached their final stellar mass , since it is expected that a fraction of the circumstellar mass will be accreted . however , simple calculations for the embedded systems based on luminosity and circumstellar mass , suggest that the embedded systems may have already accreted a significant fraction ( 10% or more ) of their probable final stellar mass .",
    "the survey has a large number of multiple systems ; all of the embedded objects are in small groupings or binary systems .",
    "morphologically , based on the system separation , we categorize our sample into three types of multiple systems : separate envelope ( separation @xmath4  6500  au ) , common envelope ( separation 150 - 3000 au ) , and common disk ( separation @xmath6 100 au ) . the separate envelope group links with the idea of initial fragmentation and collapse of multiple jeans masses within a weakly condensed configuration ( e.g. larson 1978 ; pringle 1989 ; bonnell et al .",
    "the common envelope group is similar to fragmentation of a moderately centrally condensed spherical system ( e.g. burkert & bodenheimer 1993 ; boss 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "finally , the common disk group connects with fragmentation of the early disk due to high angular momentum ( artymowiez & lubow 1994 ; bate & bonnell 1997 ) .",
    "these three categories suggest three distinct times during the star formation process where specific fragmentation mechanisms dominate the binary formation process .",
