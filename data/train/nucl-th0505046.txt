    "light nuclei on the driplines can be studied through a variety of reactions .",
    "models for nuclear reactions have been developed in recent years to incorporate the exotic features of these dripline nuclei @xcite .",
    "they include the effects of the long tails of the wavefunctions , the correct asymptotics , and the proximity of the ground state to threshold .",
    "whereas in the high energy regime many approximations are appropriate , the real challenge for reaction theory lies in the low energy regime where most approximations are not valid .",
    "it is in the low energy region ( 5 - 50 mev / a ) that observables become much more sensitive to the detailed structure of the projectile and where more can be learnt .",
    "it is also at low energy where there is a larger sensitivity to the details of the interaction with the target and where more care needs to be taken in modelling the reaction .",
    "we consider dripline nuclei of two body nature , meaning that the projectile can be decomposed into a core and a valence nucleon .",
    "then , the study of the reaction consists of a three body scattering problem . due to the loosely bound nature of the projectile ,",
    "three body effects need to be carefully considered in the lower energy regime .",
    "the exact way to formulate this problem would be to use integral faddeev equations .",
    "due to technical problems the continuum discretized coupled channel method ( cdcc ) @xcite is the best working alternative . in cdcc , the continuum couplings are included to all orders and nuclear and coulomb are treated consistently .",
    "the work here presented is based on the cdcc framework .",
    "we first present the properties of the couplings in breakup reactions , in particular continuum - continuum couplings .",
    "second we emphasize the difficulty in separating nuclear from coulomb contributions and finally we discuss the choice of the jacobi coordinates to represent the cdcc basis .",
    "finally we make some comments on lingering controversies calling for better description of the projectile .",
    "the proximity to the breakup threshold has been shown to have important effects in the reaction mechanism @xcite .",
    "continuum couplings are a way of looking into the effect of the final state interactions , an integral part of cdcc .",
    "they consist of the sum of the core - target interaction with the fragment - target interaction ( both coulomb and nuclear ) , averaged over an initial and a final bin wavefunction .",
    "a bin wavefunction is essentially a scattering wavefunction describing the two body continuum of the projectile , but averaged over a finite energy segment @xcite .         and a final d - wave with energy @xmath0.(color ) ]    the properties of these continuum couplings and",
    "the influence they can have on breakup observables were addressed in detail @xcite .",
    "the couplings considered are those involved in the breakup of @xmath1b into @xmath2be+p when impinging on a @xmath3ni target at 25.8 mev @xcite .",
    "continuum couplings are most important when the initial and final state energies ( @xmath4 and @xmath0 ) are close to each other .",
    "the energy here referred to are the relative energy of the projectile in the breakup state @xmath2be+p .",
    "if the initial and final states have the same centrifugal barrier and the transition is a monopole transition , then the couplings are only non - zero when the initial and final energies match .",
    "this corresponds to the condition of orthonormality between bin states .",
    "the orthogonality condition is illustrated very clearly in fig .",
    "[ contss ] where a contour plot of the coupling potentials is shown for initial and final s - wave bins . as the difference in the centrifugal barrier and the order of the transition increases , one obtains a wider region @xmath5 where contributions are significant . in fig .",
    "[ contsd ] we show a contour plot for an initial d - wave with energy @xmath6 to a final s - wave with energy @xmath7 ( reverse coupling are equivalent ) .",
    "it is clear the formation of ridges parallel to the @xmath8 line .",
    "these couplings are attractive for @xmath9 and repulsive for @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that continuum couplings are only relevant around a certain region of the energy space offers a hint to optimize the calculations .",
    "we have performed tests for a couple of examples , namely the above mentioned example , the @xmath1b on ni experiment from notre dame @xcite , and another case to be discussed in the next section , the @xmath2be breakup on pb experiment from michigan state university @xcite . in both cases we found up to 30% time gain for the calculations where only the lower l=0,1,2 projectile partial waves were included .",
    "for the larger calculations where l=3 is also included ( necessary for complete convergence ) the order of some transitions become too large to justify a truncation along the @xmath8 line . unfortunately , in our typical calculations , it is exactly the larger partial waves ( l>2 ) that make the calculations very large and increase running time dramatically .",
    "it is expected that this optimization will be more helpful when including core degrees of freedom as then even for the lower partial waves due to an order of magnitude increase in the number of channels @xcite .",
    "historically , there has always been the underlying assumption that , by appropriately choosing the experimental conditions , coulomb effects can be isolated from nuclear effects .",
    "especially when breakup reactions are used to extract astrophysical information , such as radiative capture rates , this separation is crucial @xcite . in @xcite breakup of @xmath2be on a heavy and a light target",
    "is considered , motivated by recent experimental plans .",
    "the breakup reaction on pb would be coulomb dominated and would allow to extract information on the astrophysical factor @xmath11 , whereas the experiment on the carbon target would be driven by nuclear effects and would provide an asymptotic normalization coefficient for the @xmath12he system , again linking back to the astrophysical capture reaction at zero energy .",
    "results of cdcc calculations from @xcite , include the continuum of @xmath2be to all orders .",
    "the most important conclusion of that work is that a simple angular selection of the so - called coulomb dissociation is not sufficient to guarantee that the data is nuclear free .",
    "identically , for the lighter target , the data is always contaminated by a coulomb contribution . also , for the carbon case , coupling effects were in general non negligible for the center of mass forward angular region .",
    "the work in @xcite shows that only careful massaging of the data , i.e. specific three - body kinematic selections , may recover the purity that is desired for astrophysical problems .",
    "it is common understanding that optical potentials can produce large uncertainties and there is a preoccupation in either keeping nuclear contributions small or choosing reaction regimes where there is less sensitivity to the details of the optical potentials .",
    "from the two cases studied in @xcite one expects that the carbon case will show a larger dependence given that it has a larger nuclear component when compared to it coulomb component . for illustration purposes we concentrate on the @xmath13-target interaction .",
    "we have compared the results when using a shallow @xcite or a deep potential fit @xcite for the @xmath14c and find a minor effect ( see fig.[opt ] left ) . for the heavier target",
    "there is a weak dependence on the optical potential and the only issue arising has to do with the fact that optical potentials are not available at the correct energy .",
    "we show the sensitivity to the energy choice in fig .",
    "the differential cross section is plotted for the case where the @xmath13-@xmath15pb potential is taken directly from the literature @xcite at the nearest available energy and compare to the results when an interpolation of the potentials is made to the correct energy . as can be seen the dependence is very small .",
    "these results suggest that , when the scattering of the fragments is well understood , the optical potentials themselves do not introduce significant ambiguities in the analysis .",
    "a variety of breakup models are presently in use and , when two different models are applied to the same problem , there is often a disparity in the predictions . in this sense , a generalized effort to bridge the various approaches is very much needed .",
    "one of the important issues lies in the choice of the coordinate representation of the continuum wavefunctions .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the problem of a two - body projectile impinging on a target consists of a three - body problem of which an exact solution would be obtained by solving the integral faddeev equations .",
    "then , the wavefunction would contain components in the three jacobi coordinates represented in fig .",
    "[ jacobi ] . due to the complexity of this task ,",
    "the cdcc method was derived @xcite .",
    "however , the cdcc method already imposes a preferential representation of the continuum , namely that of the projectile ( coordinate set ( 1 ) in fig .",
    "[ jacobi ] ) .",
    "if there are important resonant states in the target - fragment subsystem , the jacobi coordinate set ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "[ jacobi ] would become more appropriate and the representation in terms of coordinates ( 1 ) would probably be very difficult .",
    "the standard cdcc breakup uses coordinates ( 1 ) and the couplings are single particle excitations of the projectile into the continuum ( referred to as bu ) .",
    "these are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ coup ] left .",
    "where the projectile a is excited into a@xmath16 through the interaction with the target t. alternatively , one can imagine that the projectile transfers its valence particle x into the continuum of the target ( referred to as tr * ) .",
    "cdcc would be then applicable to the continuum of the t+x system and thus be associated with a final state interaction .",
    "in that situation the relevant coordinates would be ( 2 ) and the couplings would be transfer couplings such as those represented in fig .",
    "[ coup](right ) .",
    "previous work shows that both methods may hold different results .",
    "for example , the analysis of the @xmath1b breakup @xcite was performed within the standard cdcc approach whereas the @xmath1li data measured in the same energy regime could only be explained when using transfer to the continuum @xcite .",
    "we have performed a comparative study between the standard cdcc breakup approach and the so called transfer to the continuum @xcite . as a testing case",
    "we start with the @xmath1b breakup which is well understood within the standard approach .",
    "detailed data exists for @xmath1b@xmath17be@xmath18 on @xmath3ni at 25.6 mev @xcite .",
    "calculations using the standard cdcc to breakup ( bu ) @xmath19b@xmath20ni @xmath21be@xmath22ni have provided very good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "one can think of the alternative path to breakup , as transfer to the continuum ( tr * ) of the @xmath23cu , i.e. @xmath19b@xmath20ni @xmath24be@xmath25ni ) .",
    "the results for the angular distributions of @xmath2be are shown in fig .",
    "[ b8tr - bu ] .",
    "bu calculations are fully converged and provide a pronounced coulomb peak around 10 - 20 degrees .",
    "this same peak is not well reproduced with the tr * approach .",
    "in fact , the convergence rate of the tr * calculation is very slow and the calculations are much larger than bu , due to the nature of the non - local transfer kernels .",
    "the breakup of @xmath1b on @xmath3ni at 25.8 mev is a good example where the bu configuration works much better than the tr * configuration .",
    "be after @xmath1b breakup : comparison between the standard breakup calculation and the transfer to the continuum . ]",
    "general guidelines as to the conditions for choosing the standard breakup approach or the transfer to the continuum approach are under study .",
    "it seems clear that for the standard breakup approach to be valid , the average relative energy for c+x during the reaction should be small as well as the average relative angular momentum for c+x .",
    "identically if the transfer to the continuum is to be applicable , the average excitation energy for t+x should be small as well as the average relative angular momentum for t+x .",
    "however the situation is not always clear .",
    "there are also issues on the choice of certain interactions that play a different role in the transfer process from the breakup process .",
    "a more detailed discussion on these and other issues will soon become available @xcite .",
    "as breakup states are an essential path in reactions with loosely bound projectiles , only reaction models that include the continuum have been successful in describing measurements for nuclei on the driplines .",
    "there are some puzzling problems which can well correspond to cases where a single particle description is less appropriate .",
    "note that , in the reaction models we have discussed , the ground state of the projectile is taken to be a single particle state of unit spectroscopic factor produced by a simple woods - saxon and spin - orbit interaction with standard geometries with a depth fitted to the correct binding energy of the @xmath26 system .",
    "the continuum is produced with that same interaction to ensure orthogonality .",
    "below , we briefly discuss three different puzzles , the first related to breakup experiments of @xmath1b , the second related to inelastic process with @xmath27be and the last associated with knock - out measurements for @xmath28c .",
    "they serve as an illustration of the need to go beyond the models so far developed .",
    "there have been several @xmath1b breakup experiments performed at different facilities to provide the needed information for @xmath29 .",
    "using our best understanding of the reaction mechanism , and assuming the projectile can be represented by @xmath2be(inert)@xmath18 , the notre dame data and the nscl / msu data show a @xmath30% inconsistency in the quadrupole excitation strength .",
    "this is an extremely severe problem from the point of few of the direct capture cross section @xcite . in juxtaposition",
    ", accurate measurements have shown that @xmath2be first excited state contributes to the ground state of @xmath1b @xcite .",
    "ganil data of @xmath31be(p , p ) inelastic scattering have remained unpublished for the last five years as we have been unable to understand the process @xcite . due to the proximity to the continuum",
    ", there is a large contribution of breakup @xmath32be+n states to the inelastic cross section .",
    "presently , this can only be modelled within an inert few - body model .",
    "it was not possible within this model to understand @xmath32be data and the @xmath27be simultaneously .",
    "identical conclusions were found in msu data @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath32be first excited state contributes to the @xmath27be ground state @xcite .",
    "a number of preliminary tests have been performed @xcite and suggest that excitation of @xmath32be is very important for @xmath27be(p , p ) in particular in the breakup channels . however , within the current model , a definite conclusion is yet to be drawn @xcite .    the analysis @xcite of knockout data to extract spectroscopic factors for @xmath28c proved to be extremely difficult .",
    "the same reaction model that had been so successful in a number of cases did not provide very good agreement with the data .",
    "efforts to check the relevance of core excitation in reaction models @xcite , by treating it statically were also unfruitful . in those models",
    "the core excited component is kept constant throughout the reaction process .",
    "this approximation does not seem adequate , especially in cases where the couplings to core excited states are strong .",
    "although much progress has been made in the last decade concerning scattering and breakup reaction theory , core degrees of freedom in the continuum has not been studied .",
    "the significance of the structure dynamics on reaction observables can be very large ( see for instance @xcite ) and it is fundamental to address this problem as soon as possible .",
    "given that there are large core excited configurations in many dripline nuclei , one can expect an impact on many of the reaction observables .",
    "work on the dynamic treatment of core excitation in the continuum is underway @xcite .",
