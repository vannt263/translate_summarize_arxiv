    "it allows a systematic study of and experimental searches for possible nonzero values of the lorentz - violating coefficients . while most of the relevant literature considered the sme at the level of the classical action or at tree level , a number of studies",

    "lorentz - violating effects in low - energy field theory might arise from some underlying fundamental theory , for instance through spacetime discretization in quantum gravity @xcite , by spontaneous lorentz breaking in string theory @xcite , or if spacetime is noncommutative @xcite .    in this work",

    "we will consider two types of actions with sme - type lorentz - violating terms .",

    "this means that the apparent lorentz violation is an artificial one , due to an inappropriate choice of coordinates .",
    "it is easy , however , to construct slightly more complicated systems in which the lorentz violation can not be transformed away .",
    "for example , we can introduce an additional scalar field and consider the lagrangian @xmath11 in which only one of the two interacting fields have a direct coupling to the lorentz - violating coefficient .",

    "spacelike @xmath23 are not guaranteed to be excluded anymore due to modifications to the dispersion relations . as a consequence ,",
    "the integral over @xmath24 in ( [ identity ] ) may have to include negative values as well ( for a subdomain of the three - momentum ) . here and in the following ,",
    "the integral over @xmath24 is always assumed to be from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the presence of states with spacelike momenta implies also that for certain observers the separation between the positive and negative energy branches of the dispersion relation of certain states can not be taken to be @xmath28 for all @xmath29 anymore , but becomes some tilted plane . while it might be possible to accommodate such a situation by changing the integration domain accordingly",
