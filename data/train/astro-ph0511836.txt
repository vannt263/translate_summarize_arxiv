    "the abundance of li has attracted much attention , especially since the li gap has been discovered in the hyades for stars with @xmath1  k. in the context of radiative diffusion , it is interesting to examine the atmospheric abundance of lithium in stars where such a mechanism is known to be at work from the abundances of other elements , such as calcium , i.e. in the am stars .",
    "such studies have been carried out especially by burkhart & coupry @xcite and burkhart et al .",
    "their conclusion was that in general , the li abundance of am stars is close to the cosmic value ( @xmath2 in the scale where @xmath3 ) , although a small proportion of them are deficient .",
    "the latter seem in general to be either evolved stars or , as recently suggested by burkhart et al .",

    ", we present li abundances obtained for 31 am stars and 36 normal a and f stars in the field , all having hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "this sample had been defined before the hipparcos era , on purely photometric criteria , but with the purpose of testing how far the li abundance depends on the evolutionary state , i.e. on the surface gravity @xmath5 . the hipparcos data which became available later showed that the photometric luminosity calibrations of am stars were not very satisfactory ( north et al .",
    "1997 ) , but allowed to determine @xmath5 in a more fundamental way .",
    "furthermore , the sample has the advantage of presenting no bias against large rotational velocities .",
    "all stars were observed at ohp with the aurlie spectrograph attached to the 1.5 m telescope , in april 1993 and in october 1993 and 1994 .",
    "the grating no 7 was used , giving a resolving power @xmath6 in the spectral range @xmath7   .",
    "the typical exposure times were between 40 and 60 minutes , the resulting signal - to - noise ratio being between 250 and 400 .",
    "the spectra were reduced during the observing runs with the ihap package , and were later normalized to the continuum in an interactive way .",
    "the analysis was made by comparison of the observed spectra with synthetic ones convoluted with an assumed gaussian instrumental profile and with an appropriate rotational profile .",
    "the synspec code ( hubeny et al . 1995 ) and kurucz model atmospheres were used to produce the synthetic spectra .",
    "the line parameters were taken from kurucz s @xmath8 list , except of course the parameters for the li doublet .",
    "the effective temperatures were computed from geneva photometry , while the surface gravities were computed from the hipparcos parallaxes , by combining them with theoretical evolutionary tracks from schaller et al .",

    "the most striking feature of this diagram is the bimodal distribution of the li abundance for @xmath17  k , which is reminiscent of a similar distribution of f - type dwarfs in the range @xmath18 @xmath19  k reported by lambert et al .",

    "we have verified that duplicity can not account for the low apparent li abundances ( even though this might hold for some isolated cases ) .",
    "restricting the diagram to those stars with @xmath20  , the upper branch almost disappears ( there are only two normal stars left around @xmath21  k ) , while the lower one remains intact .",
    "this is related to the fact that the upper branch is populated only with normal stars , which rotate more rapidly than the am stars , while the lower branch is a mix of normal and am stars .",

    "there is one unevolved star ( hd 18769 ) for which only an upper limit to its li abundance could be obtained , but this is due to its high ( @xmath23  k ) and moderately broad lines , and the upper limit is close to the `` cosmic '' li abundance , so this is not a significant exception .",
