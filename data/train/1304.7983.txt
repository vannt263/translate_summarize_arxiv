    "when the ratio @xmath113(hi)/@xmath115 is significantly larger than the adopted here ( 2.75 ) , that is similar to those of a few very gas - rich galaxies , with the ratio @xmath113(hi)/@xmath115 of 510 [ e.g. , as in and  iv and ngc  3741 , @xcite and kk  246 , @xcite ] , the estimate of @xmath92 within @xmath113(hi ) will be still smaller than @xmath116 .",
    "anyway , to get a better quality estimate of the dm halo mass and its radial distribution , one needs in hi  mapping of the galaxy . in table",
    "[ tab : param ] , along with the summary of the main parameters for sdss j0015 + 0104 and j23540005 , we remind the properties of sdss j0926 + 3343 with 12+@xmath1(o / h)=7.12 @xcite , in order to emphasize the range of other parameter diversity in two the most metal - poor lsb dwarf galaxies known . as one can see , the difference of their main parameters ( gas mass , corrected central sb , blue luminosity ) , does not exceed a factor of 23 .",
    "their o / h and very high gas mass - fractions are very close ; the ages of the main visible old population being non - cosmological , can differ in several times , or can be about the same if @xmath83  gyr .    while we consider these two lsbds and several of their counterparts in the lynx - cancer void as unusual , it is reasonable to illustrate properties of more or less typical lsbds .",
    "one of the best lsbd samples is a subsample of late - type galaxies in the local volume and its environment studied by @xcite .",
    "we made simple statistical analysis of that subsample properties ( which includes ugc2684 , ugca20 , ugc3174 , ugca357 , ugc891 , ugc5716",
    ", ugc300 , ugc11820 and ugc634 ) and summarize their medians in the last column of table [ tab : param ] .",
    "they appear quite similar on luminosity , the central sb ( as expected from their definition ) , and @xmath3(hi)/@xmath7 ratio . however , their o / h typically is four to eight times higher and their gas mass - fraction corresponds to significantly larger proportion of stellar mass .",
    "the latter is related to their redder integrated colours .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the main differences between the lsbds studied in this paper and more typical ones are their too low metallicity ( in comparison to the expected for their luminosity , see papers ii and iii ) and too blue integrated and the outer region colours .    such unusual lsbds which combine the very low metallicity , very high gas mass fraction and blue colours of stellar population in galaxy outer parts",
    "are extremely rare .",
    "so far they are found mostly in voids . a few galaxies with @xmath1170.9 found in @xcite and @xcite can appear as similar objects , but this needs a careful study .",
    "three very gas - rich dwarf galaxies also were recently found near void centres in the void galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to look for surroundings of galaxies in the question .",
    "the examination of the immediate environment of sdss j0015 + 0104 with ned shows no catalogued galaxy with known radial velocity within the projected distance of @xmath02  mpc and @xmath118500  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the careful study of the neighbouring sky region reveals no _ luminous _ galaxies ( with @xmath11919 ) at the projected distances closer than 7  mpc with @xmath120 500  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with the separation of this cell of the local universe as a part of the `` eridanus void '' according to the description by @xcite . in his table",
    "4.1 , the eridanus void is centred on the sky at r.a.@xmath01.0  h , dec.@xmath00  and at the distance , corresponding to @xmath1212500  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the similar inspection of j23540005 surroundings with ned shows that it also resides within the void but closer to its border .",
    "the nearest luminous galaxy ngc  7716 is at @xmath02.5  mpc in projection , with @xmath122=260  km  s@xmath13 , that is at the physical distance of 4.3  mpc .",
    "the nearest subluminous galaxy ugc  12857 is located at the projected distance of 0.86  mpc and @xmath122=166  km  s@xmath13 , or at the physical distance of 2.4  mpc .",
    "the two very metal poor lsbds discussed above , are similar to several of the most metal poor lsbds in the lynx - cancer void , described in paper iii .",
    "the very high concentration of such ` unevolved ' dwarfs in that void allowed us to conclude that the very low - density environment provides the special conditions for ( a part of ) low - mass galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the existence in the eridanus void of these two unusual extremely metal defcient ( xmd ) lsbds , as well as of several other xmd galaxies ( work in progress ) is consistent with a more general statement on the causal relations between voids and ` unevolved ' dwarf galaxies .",

    "the two genuine lsbd galaxies sdss j0015 + 0104 and j23540005 with the extremely low metallicities are situated deeply in the eridanus void , with distances to the nearest luminous galaxies of @xmath140 of @xmath1417 and 4.3 mpc , respectively .",
    "the hi  integrated flux of these galaxies , along with the sdss - based optical photometry , indicate that they are very gas - rich objects , with @xmath3(hi)/l@xmath1422.35 and @xmath02.3 , and with the derived gas mass - fractions of @xmath1170.98 and 0.97 , respectively .",
    "3 .   for j23540005 , the total mass estimate based on the galaxy @xmath143 , size , and inclination angle derived from the optical axial ratio , leads to @xmath1445.3 . for j0015 + 0104 , having very narrow hi  profile , the related low rotation velocity estimate is due to the large misalignment between the optical and hi  discs .",
    "the orientation of the latter ( as evident from the gmrt hi  mapping ) is close to face - on .",
    "the @xmath69 , @xmath25 and @xmath66 colours of sdss j0015 + 0104 and j23540005 are rather ` blue ' .",
    "the ` outer ' region colours show no tracers of ubiquitous old stellar population with ages of 1012  gyr .",
    "they well match the pegase2 model track for the evolving stellar population with continuous sf for ages of t@xmath04.5 gyr for the former and t@xmath02.7  gyr for the latter .",
    "thus , all three observational parameters : o / h , @xmath112 and blue colours consistently evidence for evolutionary young status of these dwarfs .",
    "void - type environment seems to favour the appearance of unusual dwarf galaxies with properties of unevolved matter ( very low metallicity and very high gas mass fraction ) .",
    "therefore , the dedicated search for such objects among void sample galaxies can be one of the most efficient means .",
