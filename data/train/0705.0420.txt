    "the integration contour can be closed by large semicircle in the upper ( lower ) half - plane for @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",

    "in the limit @xmath174 , by using asymptotic formula ( [ jmnas ] ) for the zeros of the bessel function , replacing the summation over @xmath45 by the integration , and using the formula @xmath175 , we can see that from ( [ omega0 ] ) the formula for the cherenkov radiation intensity in a homogeneous medium is obtained .",
    "formula ( [ omega0 ] ) for the radiation of a charge moving parallel to the axis of the waveguide can be found , for example , in @xcite .",

    "the generalization of the obtained results for the case of the radiation from an electron beam is a next important step . in helical undulators",
    "the beam is bunched and the features of the radiation critically depend on the ratio of the bunch length to the wavelength of the emitted radiation .",
    "if the wavelength is smaller than the bunch length the particles in the bunch are not phase correlated and the total power radiated by the bunch is the sum of single particle parts . in the opposite limit , called the coherent spontaneous radiation regime , the wavelength of the radiation exceeds the length of the bunch and the particles radiate coherently . in this case the radiated power is enhanced by the factor of number of particles in the bunch relative to the incoherent radiation at the same wavelength .",
    "here it is important to take into account that long wavelength radiation is suppressed by the waveguide cutoff condition and this leads to the constraints for the bunch length in order to have coherent radiation in the waveguide .",
    "once the fields are evaluated , another interesting question is related to the influence of the radiation field on the motion of the radiating particles .",
    "the interaction of the beam with its own radiation can induce an additional microbunching with the possibility of coherent radiation from particles of the same microbunch .",
    "these questions require a separate consideration and we plan to address them in the future work .",
    "a recent discussion of the beam dynamics in undulators can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another point which deserves a separate investigation is the role of the other processes of the particle interaction with the medium ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , they include ionization energy losses , particle bremsstrahlung in media , and the multiple scattering ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative role of these processes depends on the particle energy and characteristics of the medium . to our best knowledge , the previous investigations in this direction",
    "were mainly concerned with the case of an unbounded homogeneous medium and the investigation of the effects induced by the presence of the waveguide requires a separate consideration . however , some general features can be obtained by using the corresponding results for a homogeneous medium .",
    "first of all , as the above - mentioned processes are absent in the vacuum , the radiation discussed in the present paper is the main mechanism of the energy losses in sufficiently rarefied medium .",
    "next , while the ionization losses by an electron rise logarithmically with energy and bremsstrahlung losses arise nearly linearly , the undulator radiation intensity arises quadratically and , hence , dominates at sufficiently high energies . for a particle moving in air the ionization losses dominate those due to the bremsstrahlung for the energies less than 100 mev . by using the standard formula , it can be seen that in the example corresponding to figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] the relative energy loss is @xmath203 per meter . an interesting possibility to escape ionization losses in the medium",
    "was indicated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "it was argued that a narrow empty channel along the particle trajectory in the solid dielectric does not affect the radiation intensity if the channel radius is less than the radiation wavelength . from the other side ,",
    "the maximum impact parameter for ionization losses is of the order @xmath204 $ ] , where @xmath119 is the mean excitation energy for the atom of the medium , and for the channel radius larger than @xmath205 ionization losses are suppressed . as in other processes involving multiple scattering",
    ", we expect that this effect will appear in the formula for the radiation intensity at given frequency in the form of the additional multiplicative factor and there exists a critical energy of the particle below which the multiple scattering does not effect the radiation .",
    "we can try to estimate this factor by using the migdal formula . for the values of the parameters taken in the example above",
    "this factor leads to the decrease of the radiation intensity by @xmath206 .",
    "we have investigated the electromagnetic field generated by a charge moving along a helical orbit inside a circular waveguide with dielectric filling . this type of motion is involved in magnetic devices called helical undulators which are inserted into a straight sector of storage rings .",
    "the helical undulators are used to generate circularly polarized intense electromagnetic radiation in a relatively narrow bandwidth .",
    "the frequency of radiation is tunable by varying the beam energy and the magnetic field . in this paper",
    "we have seen that the insertion of a waveguide into the helical undulator provides an additional mechanism for tuning the characteristics of the emitted radiation by choosing the parameters of the waveguide and filling medium .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are presented as the sum of two parts .",
    "the first one corresponds to the fields of the charge in the homogeneous medium and the second one is induced by the presence of the waveguide .",
    "the fourier components of the latter are given by formulae ( hml1w ) , ( [ hmz1w ] ) , ( [ electricb ] ) , ( [ electricc ] ) . in order to extract from the total fields the parts corresponding to the radiation",

    "we have derived formulae ( [ itm ] ) and ( [ ite ] ) for the radiation intensity emitted in the form of the tm and te waves .",
    "limiting cases are considered and features of the radiation are investigated . in particular , we have seen that the main part of the radiated quanta is emitted in the form of the te waves .",
    "applications of general formulae to helical undulators are given .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that in the case of filled waveguide the radiation with features characteristic for ultrarelativistic particles in the empty waveguide is obtained for moderately relativistic particles .",
    "the radiation emitted on the waveguide modes propagates inside the cylinder and the waveguide serves as a natural collector for the radiation .",
    "this eliminates the necessity for focusing to achieve a high - power spectral intensity .",
