    "@xmath11 is obtained by adding trivial @xmath12-handle to @xmath7 whose core is @xmath13-parallel in @xmath8 and @xmath14 is obtained by removing the @xmath12-handle from @xmath8 .",

    "* @xmath5    in section @xmath16 , we show that any two heegaard splittings have a union stabilization , similar to the results of @xcite .",
    "the minimal genus among the union stabilizations is called the _ union genus_.",
    "@xmath17 from the definition of the union stabilization , it follows that @xmath18 .",
    "+ @xmath19 the union stabilization and the union genus can be defined similarly for heegaard splittings of @xmath2-manifolds with boundary .",
    "when two heegaard splittings of a @xmath2-manifold are given , it has been conjectured that they become isotopic after a single stabilization of the larger genus one @xcite",
    ". however , recently there are results that this is not true and there are examples that require as many stabilizations as the genus of the heegaard splittings @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this implies that the union genus also can be large enough . in section @xmath2 , we give some examples with bounds on the union genus .    in section @xmath20 , we give an example of a candidate for which the union genus is strictly larger than the stable genus implying that a common stabilization of two heegaard splittings can not be obtained by the union of both handlebodies .",
    "we begin with a simple case where two heegaard splittings are isotopic .",
    "suppose @xmath0 and @xmath1 are isotopic heegaard splittings of a @xmath2-manifold .",
    "then there is a union stabilization with genus increased by one .",
    "the two handlebodies of heegaard splittings are yellow and blue handlebodies respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) . let some parts of each handlebodies coincide and it is colored green .",
    "we can see that the disk @xmath21 serves as a stabilizing disk for both .",
    "blue @xmath22 green , width=264 ]    a _ spine _ @xmath23 of a handlebody @xmath24 is a finite graph in @xmath24 where @xmath24 defomation retracts to @xmath23 .",
    "the following is a result similar to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be two heegaard splittings of a @xmath2-manifold @xmath3 .",
    "then there exists a union stabilization of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "take @xmath27 and @xmath28 as a very thin neighborhood of @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath31 .",
    "hence @xmath28 is in @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath28 is an embedded graph in @xmath32 .",
    "note that genus @xmath33 handlebody is homeomorphic to @xmath33-punctured disk @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "we consider the projection of @xmath28 to the @xmath33-punctured disk and the diagram of @xmath28 with over and under information .",
    "if we add sufficiently many tunnels to @xmath28 ( at least , as many tunnels as the number of crossings of the diagram ) , the exterior in @xmath32 would be a handlebody .",
    "connect each tunnel to @xmath36 with an arc so that the exterior of the union of @xmath28 and tunnels and arcs is still a handlebody .",
    "however , adding tunnels and arcs is equivalent to the isotopy of some parts of @xmath28 along the tunnels and arcs and let the parts coincide with some parts of @xmath27 .",
    "2 shows the isotopy .",
    "then we can see that @xmath37 is a union stabilization since @xmath38 is a collection of @xmath2-balls and by the uniqueness of heegaard splittings of a handlebody @xcite .",
    "and @xmath38 @xmath22 green @xmath2-balls , width=302 ]",
    "in this section we show some examples with numerical bounds on the union genus .",
    "first example is that the spine of the handlebody of one heegaard splitting is on the other heegaard surface . for a heegaard",
    "splitting @xmath39 , let @xmath40 denote the genus of @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be two heegaard splittings of a @xmath2-manifold @xmath3 such that @xmath30 is in @xmath42",
    ". then the union genus of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is less than or equal to @xmath43 .",
    "take @xmath28 as s a very thin neighborhood of @xmath30 .",
    "push @xmath28 slightly into @xmath32 so that there is an annulus of parallelism between @xmath44 and @xmath45 . connect @xmath27 and @xmath28 by an essential arc of the annulus .",
    "then the result is a @xmath46-times stabilization of @xmath25 .",
    "connecting @xmath27 and @xmath28 by an arc is equivalent to making some parts of @xmath27 and @xmath28 coincide as in the proof of theorem 2.2 . then since @xmath38 is a @xmath2-ball and by the uniqueness of heegaard splittings of a handlebody @xcite , it is also a @xmath47-times stabilization of @xmath26 .",
    "hence the union genus of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is less than or equal to @xmath43 .",
    "the next example is the @xmath48 presentation of a knot @xmath49 in @xmath50 .",

    "then we call @xmath55 the genus @xmath33 , @xmath54-bridge presentation of @xmath49 , or @xmath48 presentation for short .",

    "3 @xmath61 .",
    "then the two heegaard splittings induced by @xmath62 and @xmath63 has union genus less than or equal to @xmath64 .",
    "it suffices to show that the exterior in @xmath50 of the union of @xmath49 and the tunnels in @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a genus @xmath64 handlebody .",

    "since @xmath68 is a @xmath67-punctured genus @xmath33 surface , the total exterior @xmath69 is homeomorphic to a genus @xmath64 handlebody .",
    "in this section , we construct an example of a candidate for which the union genus is strictly larger than the stable genus .        the two unknotting tunnels intersect in two points .",
    "by some perturbation , we can make them disjoint .",
    "then there exist some knot , for example a @xmath16-bridge knot @xmath71 in knot table , such that the four cases of perturbations as in fig .",
    "5 do not give genus three handlebodies .",
    "( for each case , we can check the fundamental group of the exterior using the wirtinger presentation . )",
    "we can see that the stable genus of above example is three .",
    "the common stabilization is isotopic to the stabilization of the genus two heegaard splitting induced by the tunnel connecting the two strands of the knot ( fig ."
