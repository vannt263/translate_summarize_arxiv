    "verbs are sometimes omitted in japanese sentences .",
    "it is necessary to resolve verb ellipses for purposes of language understanding , machine translation , and dialogue processing .",
    "therefore , we investigated verb ellipsis resolution in japanese sentences . in connection with our approach",
    ", we would like to emphasize the following points :    * little work has been done so far on resolution of verb ellipsis in japanese .",
    "* although much work on verb ellipsis in english has handled the reconstruction of the ellipsis structure in the case when the omitted verb is given , little work has handled the estimation of what is the omitted verb @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , we handle the estimation of what is the omitted verb .",
    "* in the case of japanese , the omitted verb phrase is sometimes not in the context , and the system must construct the omitted verb by using knowledge ( or common sense ) .",
    "we use example - based method to solve this problem .",
    "this paper describes a practical method to recover omitted verbs by using surface expressions and examples . in short ,",
    "( 1 ) when the referent of a verb ellipsis is in the context , we use surface expressions ( clue words ) ; ( 2 ) when the referent is not in the context , we use examples ( linguistic data ) .",
    "we define the verb to which a verb ellipsis refers as _ the recovered verb_. for example , `` [ kowashita ] a phrase in brackets `` [ ' ' , `` ] '' represents an omitted verb . ] ( broke ) '' in the second sentence of the following example is a verb ellipsis .",
    "`` kowashita ( broke ) '' in the first sentence is a recovered verb . @xmath0{10 cm } \\small    \\begin{tabular}[t]{lll } kare - wa & ironna mono - wo & kowashita.\\\\ ( he ) &",
    "( several things ) & ( broke ) \\\\ \\multicolumn{3}{l } { ( he broke several things.)}\\\\ \\end{tabular }     \\vspace{0.3 cm }      \\begin{tabular}[t]{lll } kore - mo & are - mo & [ kowashita].\\\\ ( this )   & ( that ) & ( broke ) \\\\ \\multicolumn{2}{l } { ( [ he broke ] this and that.)}\\\\ \\end{tabular } \\end{minipage}\\ ] ]    \\(1 ) when a recovered verb exists in the context , we use surface expressions ( clue words ) .",
    "this is because an elliptical sentence in the case ( 1 ) is in one of several typical patterns and has some clue words .",
    "for example , when the end of an elliptical sentence is the clue word `` mo ( also ) '' , the system judges that the sentence is a repetition of the previous sentence and the recovered verb ellipsis is the verb of the previous sentence .",
    "\\(2 ) when a recovered verb is not in the context , we use examples .",
    "the reason is that omitted verbs in this case ( 2 ) are diverse and we use examples to construct the omitted verbs .",
    "the following is an example of a recovered verb that does not appear in the context .",
    "@xmath0{10 cm }      \\begin{tabular}[t]{lll }        sou & umaku ikutowa & [ omoenai ] .\\\\",

    "we handle only verb ellipses in the ends of sentences .",
    "we classified verb ellipses from the view point of machine processing .",
    "the classification is shown in figure [ fig : shouryaku_bunrui ] .",
    "first , we classified verb ellipses by checking whether there is a recovered verb in the context or not .",
    "next , we classified verb ellipses by meaning .",
    "`` in the context '' and `` not in the context '' in figure [ fig : shouryaku_bunrui ] represent where the recovered verb exists , respectively .",
    "although the above classification is not perfect and needs modification , we think that it is useful to understand the outline of verb ellipses in machine processing .",
    "the feature and the analysis of each category of verb ellipsis are described in the following sections .        in question ",
    "answer sentences verbs in answer sentences are often omitted , when answer sentences use the same verb as question sentences .",
    "for example , the verb of `` kore wo ( this ) '' is omitted and is `` kowashita ( break ) '' in the question sentence . @xmath0{11.5 cm }    \\begin{tabular}[t]{ll } nani - wo & kowashitano\\\\ ( what ) & ( break )   \\\\ \\multicolumn{2}{l } { ( what did you break?)}\\\\ \\end{tabular }     \\vspace{0.3 cm }      \\begin{tabular}[t]{ll } kore - wo & [ kowashita].\\\\ ( this )   & ( break)\\\\ \\multicolumn{2}{l } { ( [ i broke ] this.)}\\\\ \\end{tabular } \\end{minipage}\\ ] ]    the system judges whether the sentences are question  answer sentences or not by using surface expressions such as `` nani ( what ) '' , and , if so , it judges that the recovered verb is the verb of the question sentence .      in sentences which play a supplementary role to the previous sentence , verbs are sometimes omitted . for example , the second sentence is supplementary , explaining that `` the key i lost '' is `` house key '' . @xmath0{11.5 cm }    \\begin{tabular}[t]{ll } kagi - wo & nakushita.\\\\ ( key )   & ( lost)\\\\ \\multicolumn{2}{l } { ( i lost my key . ) } \\end{tabular }    \\vspace{0.3 cm }      \\begin{tabular}[t]{lll } ie - no & kagi - wo & [ nakushita.]\\\\ ( house ) & ( key )   & ( lost)\\\\ \\multicolumn{2}{l } { ( [ i lost ] my house key . ) } \\end{tabular } \\end{minipage}\\ ] ] to solve this , we present the following method using word meanings . when the word at the end of the elliptical sentence is semantically similar to the word of the same case element in the previous sentence , they correspond , and the omitted verb is judged to be the verb of the word of the same case element in the previous sentence . in this case , since `` kagi ( key ) '' and `` ie - no kagi ( house key ) '' are semantically similar in the sense that they are both keys , the system judges they correspond , and the verb of `` ie - no kagi - wo ( house key ) '' is `` nakushita ( lost ) '' .",
    "in addition to this method , we use methods using surface expressions . for example , when a sentence has clue words such as the particle `` mo '' ( which indicates repetition ) , the sentence is judged to be the supplement of the previous sentence .",
    "there are many cases when an elliptical sentence is the supplement of the previous sentence . in this work , if there is no clue , the system judges that an elliptical sentence is the supplement of the previous sentence .",
    "sometimes , in interrogative sentences , the particle `` wa '' is at the end of the sentence and the verb is omitted .",
    "for example , the following sentence is an interrogative sentence and the verb is omitted .",
    "@xmath0{11.5 cm }    \\begin{tabular}[t]{ll } namae - wa & [ nani - desuka.]\\\\ ( name )   & ( what?)\\\\ \\multicolumn{2}{l } { ( [ what is ] your name ? ) } \\end{tabular } \\end{minipage}\\ ] ] if the end is of the form of `` noun @xmath1 wa '' , the sentence is probably an interrogative sentence , and thus the system judges it to be an interrogative sentence .      in the case of `` not in the context ''",
    "the following example exists besides `` interrogative sentence '' .",

    "the form of the recovered expression has various types .",
    "this problem is difficult to analyze .    to solve this problem , we estimate a recovered content by using a large amount of linguistic data .",
    "when japanese people read the above sentence , they naturally recognize the omitted verb is `` arimasu ( i have ) '' .",
    "this is because they often use the sentence `` jitsu - wa chotto onegaiga arimasu .",
    "( to tell the truth , i have a request . ) '' in daily life .",
    "when we perform the same interpretation using a large amount of linguistic data , we detect the sentence containing an expression which is semantically similar to `` jitsu - wa chotto onegaiga .",
    "( to tell you the truth , ( i have ) a request . ) '' , and the latter part of `` jitsu - wa chotto onegaiga '' is judged to be the content of the ellipsis . to put it",

    "figure [ tab:6c_dousarei ] shows that the verb ellipsis in `` onegai ( request ) '' was analyzed well .    since the end of the sentence is not an expression which can normally be at the end of a sentence , rule 1 was not satisfied and the system judged that a verb ellipsis exists . by rule 5",
    "the system took the candidate `` the end of the previous sentence '' .",
    "next , by rule 7 using corpus , the system took the candidate `` arimasu ( i have ) '' . although there are `` aru ( i have ) '' and `` arimasu ( i have ) '' , the frequency of `` arimasu ( i have ) '' is more than the others and it was selected as a candidate .",
    "the candidate `` arimasu ( i have ) '' having the best score was properly judged to be the desired recovered verb .",
    "we ran the experiment on the novel `` bokko- chan '' @xcite .",
    "this is because novels contain various verb ellipses . in the experiment , we divided the text into training sentences and test sentences .",
    "we made heuristic rules by examining training sentences .",
    "we tested our rules by using test sentences .",
    "we show the results of verb ellipsis resolution in table [ tab:0verb_result ] .",
    "to judge whether the result is correct or not , we used the following evaluation criteria . when the recovered verb is correct , even if the tense , aspect , etc .",
    "are incorrect , we regard it as correct . for ellipses in interrogative sentences ,",
    "if the system estimates that the sentence is an interrogative sentence , we judge it to be correct .",
    "when the desired recovered verb appears in the context and the recovered verb chosen by the rule using corpus is nearly equal to the correct verb , we judge that it is correct .      as in table",
    "[ tab:6c_sougoukekka ] we obtained a recall rate of 73% and a precision rate of 66% in the estimation of indirect anaphora on test sentences .    the recall rate of `` in the context '' is higher than that of `` not in the context '' . for `` in the context '' the system only specifies the location of the recovered verb .",
    "but in the case of `` not in the context '' the system judges that the recovered verb does not exist in the context and gathers the recovered verb from other information .",
    "therefore `` not in the context '' is very difficult to analyze .",
    "the accuracy rate of `` other ellipses ( use of common sense ) '' was not so high .",
