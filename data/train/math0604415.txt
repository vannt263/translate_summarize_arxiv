    "in the last decade the study of the geometry of surfaces in the three - dimensional thurston geometries has grown considerably .",
    "one reason is that these spaces can be endowed with a complete metric with a large isometry group ; another , more recent , is the announced proof of thurston geometric conjecture , which ensures the dominant role of this spaces among the three - dimensional geometries .    leaving aside the space forms @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , among the left five thurston geometries the heisenberg space is probably the most studied and the geometry of surfaces is well understood . in recent years the study of the geometry of surfaces in the two product spaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 is growing very rapidly , and the interest is mainly focused on minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is first to investigate on some geometric properties of minimal graphs in @xmath5 ( theorem  [ pro - geo ] and [ teo - min ] ) and to produce some new examples including complete ones . in the last part ( theorem  [ uffa ] )",

    "the space @xmath1 , with the group structure derived by the composition of proper affine maps , is a lie group and the metric @xmath11 is left invariant . therefore the product @xmath5 is a lie group with the left invariant product metric @xmath12 with respect to the metric @xmath13 an orthonormal basis of left invariant vector fields is @xmath14 and the non zero components of the christoffel symbols are : @xmath15",
