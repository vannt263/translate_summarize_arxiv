    "the numerical observations @xcite of the solitary wave solution of the energy integral at @xmath0 , motivate us to set a general analytical theory for the existence of solitary wave and double layer solution of the energy integral at @xmath19 .",

    "the most interesting fact is the existence of the double layer solution at @xmath0 .",

    "actually , it is not possible to apply small amplitude method to study the weakly nonlinear solitary structures in a parameter regime where finite amplitude solitary structures exist at @xmath0 , because in any small amplitude method , amplitude of solitary structure always tends to zero as @xmath47 which contradicts the occurrence of finite amplitude solitary structure at @xmath0 .",

    "\\(b ) if in a portion of the solution space , there exist solitary structures having a finite amplitude at @xmath0 , then it is simple to find the amplitude as well as width of the solitary structure for @xmath48 ( for sufficiently small strictly positive quantity @xmath49 ) and this can be easily done by plotting @xmath22 against @xmath5 at @xmath48 .",
    "however , if in a portion of the solution space , there does not exist solitary structures at @xmath0 , then it is very difficult to find the amplitude as well as width of the solitary wave for @xmath48 by plotting @xmath22 against @xmath5 .",
    "in this situation , the general prescription is to use the small amplitude method for finding the weakly nonlinear solitary structure at @xmath48 .",
    "\\(c ) considering any specific problem , it can be easily checked that the solitary structure along the curve @xmath0 is same as the solitary structure for @xmath3 , if one can move the solution space through the family of curves parallel to the curve @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we have used the analytical results as presented in this paper to a specific problem of dust acoustic wave in nonthermal plasma to investigate new results and new physical ideas .",

    "finally , a brief conclusion has been given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) can be regarded as the one - dimensional motion of a particle of unit mass whose position is @xmath5 at time @xmath50 with velocity @xmath51 in a potential well @xmath22 .",
    "the first term of the energy integral can be regarded as the kinetic energy of a particle of unit mass at position @xmath5 and time @xmath50 whereas @xmath22 is the potential energy of the same particle at that instant . since",
    "kinetic energy is always a non - negative quantity , @xmath52 for the entire motion , i.e. , zero is the maximum value for @xmath22 . again from ( [ energy int ] ) , we find @xmath53 , i.e. the force acting on the particle at the position @xmath5 is @xmath54 .",
    "suppose , @xmath55 , therefore , the particle is in equilibrium at @xmath56 because the velocity as well as the force acting on the particle at @xmath56 are simultaneously equal to zero .",
    "now if @xmath57 can be made an unstable position of equilibrium , the energy integral can be interpreted as the motion of an oscillatory particle if @xmath58 for some @xmath59 , i.e. , if the particle is slightly displaced from its unstable position of equilibrium then it moves away from its unstable position of equilibrium and it continues its motion until its velocity is equal to zero , i.e. , until @xmath5 takes the value @xmath60 .",
    "now the force acting on the particle of unit mass at position @xmath61 is @xmath62 . for @xmath63 , the force acting on the particle at the point @xmath64",
    "is directed towards the point @xmath56 if @xmath65 , i.e. , if @xmath66 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath67 , the force acting on the particle at the point @xmath64 is directed towards the point @xmath56 if @xmath68 , i.e. , if @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath69 ( for the positive potential side ) or if @xmath66 ( for the negative potential side ) then the particle reflects back again to @xmath57 . again , if @xmath70 then the velocity @xmath71 as well as the force @xmath72 both are simultaneously equal to zero at @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , if the particle is slightly displaced from its unstable position of equilibrium ( @xmath57 ) it moves away from @xmath57 and it continues its motion until the velocity is equal to zero , i.e. , until @xmath5 takes the value @xmath61 .",
    "however it can not be reflected back again at @xmath57 as the velocity and the force acting on the particle at @xmath61 vanish simultaneously . actually , if @xmath69 ( for @xmath67 ) or if @xmath66 ( for @xmath63 ) the particle takes an infinite long time to move away from the unstable position of equilibrium .",
    "after that it continues its motion until @xmath5 takes the value @xmath60 and again it takes an infinite long time to come back its unstable position of equilibrium .",
    "therefore , for the existence of a ppsw ( npsw ) solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) , we must have the following : ( a ) @xmath56 is the position of unstable equilibrium of the particle , ( b ) @xmath58 , @xmath73 @xmath74 for some @xmath75 @xmath76 , which is nothing but the condition for oscillation of the particle within the interval @xmath77 and ( c ) @xmath78 for all @xmath79 @xmath80 ) , which is the condition to define the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) within the interval @xmath77 . for the existence of a ppdl ( npdl ) solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] )",
    ", the conditions ( a ) and ( c ) remain unchanged but here ( b ) has been modified in such a way that the particle can not be reflected again at @xmath57 , i.e. , the condition ( b ) assumes the following form : @xmath81 , @xmath82 for some @xmath75 @xmath83 ) .",
    "the above discussions for the existence of solitary waves and double layers are valid if @xmath57 is an unstable position of equilibrium , i.e. , if @xmath84 along with @xmath55 .",
    "in other words , @xmath56 can be made an unstable position of equilibrium if the potential energy of the said particle attains its maximum value at @xmath56 .",
    "now , the condition @xmath85 gives a lower bound @xmath1 of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "this @xmath1 is , in general , a function of the parameters involved in the system , or a constant .",
    "therefore , if @xmath89 , the potential energy of the said particle attains its minimum value at @xmath56 , and consequently , @xmath56 is the position of stable equilibrium of the particle , and in this case , it is impossible to make any oscillation of the particle even when it is slightly displaced from its position of stable equilibrium , and consequently there is no question of existence of solitary waves or double layers for @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , for the position of unstable equilibrium of the particle at @xmath56 , i.e. , for @xmath90 , the function @xmath22 must be convex within a neighborhood of @xmath56 and in this case both type of solitary waves ( negative or positive potential ) may exist if other conditions are fulfilled .",
    "now suppose that @xmath91 and also @xmath92 , then if @xmath93 , the potential energy of the said particle attains its maximum value at @xmath56 and consequently , @xmath56 is the position of unstable equilibrium . on the other hand if @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath94 , the potential energy of the said particle attains its minimum value at @xmath56 and consequently , @xmath56 is the position of stable equilibrium of the particle and in this case there is no question of existence of solitary wave solution and/or double layer solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) .",
    "but if @xmath28 along with @xmath95 , then without going through the complete analytical investigation , it is difficult to predict the existence of solitary wave and/or double layer solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) at @xmath0 . in this situation ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath28 along with @xmath95 , to confirm the existence of solitary wave and/or double layer solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) at @xmath0 , some definitions and well - known theorems of real analysis are necessary .",
    "so , in the next section , we consider only those definitions and theorems of real analysis for continuation of physical interpretation of the existence of solitary wave and/or double layer solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) at @xmath0 when @xmath28 along with @xmath95 .",
