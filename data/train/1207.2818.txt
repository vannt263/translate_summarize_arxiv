    "perovskite cobaltites la@xmath0a@xmath1coo@xmath6 ( @xmath7 = sr , ba or ca ) have recently attracted much attention since they exhibit various intriguing physical properties such as magnetoresistance , large thermoelectric effect , insulator - metal and spin - state transitions.@xcite the parent compound , lacoo@xmath6 , has a nonmagnetic insulating ground state with co@xmath5 ions in a low spin configuration . upon warming ,",
    "a paramagnetic ( pm ) insulating state gradually develops above @xmath8 90 k , where a spin - state transition from low spin ( ls ) to higher spin state occurs .",
    "the partial substitution of la@xmath5 ions by divalent earth - alkaline ions ( @xmath7 ) strongly affects the magnetic and transport properties of this system due to the addition of holes into the lattice , creating formally co@xmath9 ions , and the structural changes because of the different ionic radii of the substitutes.@xcite a small doping can shift the spin - state transition to low temperature and rapidly suppress the nonmagnetic ground state .",
    "consequently , ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlations arising from the double - exchange ( de ) coupling between co@xmath5-co@xmath9 ions appear , which develop with doping and result in a long - range fm ordered state above a critical doping level ( @xmath10).@xcite moreover , various experimental techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , small - angle neutron scattering @xcite , and muon spin relaxation @xcite have demonstrated that the magnetic states of doped cobaltites at low temperatures are inhomogeneous .",
    "nanosized fm clusters were found by neutron scattering @xcite to form in the non - fm matrix , which increases in density with doping and coalesce at @xmath10 .",
    "nmr measurements on the sr - doped cobaltites revealed the coexistence of fm regions , spin - glass regions , and hole - poor ls regions at low temperatures.@xcite    recently , magnetic phase inhomogeneity is also found at high temperatures by the studies of small - angle neutron scattering and dc susceptibilities on la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath6 , where a short - range fm clustered state exists well above @xmath4.@xcite the existence of fm clusters above @xmath4 is frequently reported in various fm oxides such as manganites,@xcite layered cobaltites,@xcite and spin - chain compounds.@xcite this often leads to griffiths singularity @xcite , which is originally proposed for randomly diluted ising ferromagnets . in the original model , the nearest - neighbor exchange bonds with strength @xmath11 and 0 were argued to be distributed randomly with probability @xmath12 and 1 - @xmath12 , respectively . for @xmath13 ( percolation threshold ) , no long - range fm order is established , while for @xmath14 , the long - range fm phase exists in a reduced @xmath15 below the ordering temperature of undiluted ferromagnet @xmath16(@xmath12 = 1 ) known as griffiths temperature ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the region @xmath18 , where the system is characterized by the coexistence of fm clusters within the globally pm phase , is refereed as the griffiths phase . in doped perovskite fm oxides , the quenched disorder induced by the @xmath7-doping acts as random dilution .",
    "thus , the griffiths model can be viewed as applicable to those oxides .",
    "actually , for various doped manganites including la@xmath19ca@xmath20mno@xmath2,@xcite la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( 0.07 @xmath21 0.16),@xcite and la@xmath22ba@xmath23mno@xmath2,@xcite which exhibit many similarities in the magnetic and transport properties to the doped cobaltites such as hole - doping induced de fm orderings and percolation - type insulator - metal transitions,@xcite the clustered phases above @xmath16 were reported to be well described by the griffiths phase . in those oxides , the griffiths phase is typically characterized by a sharply downward deviation from the curie - weiss ( cw ) pm behavior in the low - field inverse susceptibility ( @xmath24 ) as the temperature approaches @xmath4 from above . however , for the sr - doped cobaltites , it was found that @xmath24 exhibits an upward deviation from the high-@xmath25 cw behavior , which is in stark contrast to the predictions of the griffiths model and indicates the existence of non - griffiths - like clustered phase in those compounds @xcite .",
    "similar non - griffiths - like clustered phase was also reported in la@xmath19ba@xmath20coo@xmath6.@xcite those results seem to point out that the fm clustered states above @xmath16 in the doped cobaltites are quite different from those in the doped manganites .",
    "however , the clear understanding on the formation of the unique non - griffiths - like phase is still lacking .    on the other hand , for doped cobaltites , many magnetic studies have demonstrated that their magnetic properties strongly depend on the ionic size of the dopant.@xcite specially , compared to the two cases doped by larger ions , i.e. , @xmath7 = sr or ba , the ca - doped crystals exhibit significant distinctions in the magnetic behaviors .",
    "for example , for @xmath7 = sr and ba , @xmath10 is around 0.20,@xcite while for @xmath7 = ca , it is reported that @xmath10 is much lower as about 0.05.@xcite furthermore , at the same doping level , @xmath4 and the saturation moment for ca doped ones are somewhat lower and smaller than those for @xmath7 = sr and ba , respectively.@xcite recent elastic neutron scattering revealed that in crystals with sr and ba , jahn - teller ( jt ) spin polarons associated with intermediate - spin ( is ) state co@xmath5 ions are present , whereas they are not detected in those with ca.@xcite therefore , there are two interesting issues to be addressed : ( 1 ) whether is a short - range fm state present above @xmath4 in the ca - doped cobaltites , similar to the sr- and ba - doped ones ?",
    "( 2 ) if present , whether is it a non - giriffiths - like or griffiths - like phase ? however , until now , to the best of our knowledge , no study on the magnetic inhomogeneity above @xmath4 for the ca - doped cobaltites is carried out .    in this work ,",
    "the magnetic properties of la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2 ( lcco ) ( 0.10 @xmath21 0.25 ) are systemically studied and the above issues are focused on .",
    "we find that the magnetic susceptibilities for all the ca - doped samples deviate from the cw law well above @xmath4 , which indicates that a short - range fm state also exists in this compound .",
    "however , quite different from the sr- and ba - doped cobaltites , but similar to the doped manganites , the deviation is sharply downward and the short - range fm state herein can be well viewed as the griffiths phase .",
    "the possible origin of this important difference is discussed .",
    "polycrystalline lcco ( 0.10 @xmath21 0.25 ) were prepared by conventional solid - state reaction .",
    "the stoichiometric mixture of la@xmath26o@xmath6 , caco@xmath6 , and co@xmath6o@xmath27 powders was well ground and then calcined at 1000 and 1100 @xmath28 for 24h with intermittent grinding .",
    "the pellets pressed from the powders were sintered at 1200 @xmath28 in the flowing oxygen for 48 h. the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns were measured at room temperature on a rigaku ttr - iii diffractometer using cu k@xmath29 radiation .",
    "the magnetic measurements were carried out with a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( quantum design mpms xl-7 ) .",
    "room temperature xrd patterns of lcco are shown in fig .",
    "all diffraction peaks for each sample can be well indexed by the perovskite structure without any impure phases . the samples with @xmath30 @xmath31 0.18 has rhombohedral symmetry , while for @xmath30 = 0.25 , it has orthorhombic symmetry . around @xmath30 = 0.20 ,",
    "there is a structural change from rhombohedral to orthorhombic symmetry , as shown in the inset of figure 1 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the previous structural studies on the ca - doped cobaltites.@xcite    figure 2 shows the temperature dependent field - cooling ( fc ) magnetization under @xmath32 = 100 oe for lcco . upon cooling ,",
    "the magnetization for all the samples shows a sharp rise , indicating the fm ground state at low temperature .",
    "@xmath4 , identified from the minimum in @xmath33 , increases from @xmath8 52 to 151 k as @xmath30 increases from 0.10 to 0.25 , as summarized in figure 5 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath24 under @xmath32 = 100 oe for all the samples are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the susceptibilities exhibit a cw pm behavior at high temperatures , i.e. @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is curie constant and @xmath36 is cw temperature .",
    "the fitting @xmath36 and the effective magnetic moment ( @xmath37 ) obtained from the fitting @xmath35 are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "both the parameters show an increase with @xmath30 .",
    "the increase in @xmath36 , together with the increase of @xmath4 , indicates that the fm interactions are enhanced with doping . for doped cobaltites ,",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath37 is given by @xmath37 = @xmath38@xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the spin value of co@xmath5 and co@xmath9 ions , respectively , and @xmath38 is land g factor .",
    "both co ions have three possible spin states , _",
    "i.e. _ , ls , is , and high - spin ( hs ) states . for co@xmath5 ions",
    ", it is widely accepted to be in is state in doped cobaltites , while for co@xmath9 ions the spin state is more controversial.@xcite assuming the spin state of co@xmath9 ions are in ls , is , and hs ones , respectively , we can calculate the theoretical @xmath37 as a function of @xmath30 , which are shown in figure 4(a ) .",
    "it is clear that the is case is most in accord with the experimental result .",
    "therefore , both co ions are in is states for those ca - doped samples in the high-@xmath25 pm state .    upon cooling",
    ", one can see that @xmath24 for lcco shows a deviation from the cw law well above @xmath4 , which strongly suggests that a short - range fm state exists before the long - range fm transition in those compounds .",
    "the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath42 , i.e. , the temperature below which @xmath24 starts to deviate , is plotted in figure 5 , which shows a slight increase from 161 to 181 k with doping .",
    "this result together with those recently reported in the sr- and ba - doped cobaltites @xcite imply that the preformation of the fm clustered state above @xmath4 should be a common phenomenon in hole - doped lacoo@xmath6 .",
    "however , in contrast with the two cases doped by larger ions , where the deviation in @xmath24 is upward , the ca - doped samples exhibit the sharply downward deviations in @xmath24 .",
    "the downturn , similar to those reported in the doped manganites,@xcite is a typical characteristic of the griffiths phase . in the griffiths phase",
    ", the downward deviation in low - field @xmath24 is proposed to originate from the enhanced @xmath43 due to the contribution from the fm clusters above @xmath4 , and can be gradually suppressed with increasing @xmath32 due to polarization of spins outside the clusters.@xcite to verify the latter feature , we have further measured the magnetizations under @xmath32 = 500 and 5k oe for those compounds and plotted the corresponding @xmath24 in figure 3 , too .",
    "it is clearly seen that the deviation is markedly suppressed indeed under the larger magnetic fields for all the samples , which supports the presence of the griffiths singularity in lcco .    according to the model of griffiths phase ,",
    "the system exhibits neither a pure pm behavior nor a long - range fm order in the griffiths phase regime.@xcite consequently , the system response is dominated by the largest magnetic cluster / correlated volume , which will give rise to a characteristic @xmath25-dependence for the low - field susceptibility by the following power law : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the susceptibility exponent and 0 @xmath46 1.@xcite in order to further confirm the griffiths singularity in lcco , we have fitted @xmath24 under @xmath32 = 100 oe by the above law for all the samples . it is pertinent to note that an incorrect value of @xmath47 in this formula can lead to unphysical fitting and erroneous determination of @xmath45 . to estimate @xmath45 accurately ,",
    "we have followed the approach by jiang et al.@xcite , where @xmath47 is correctly given as fitting the data in the pure pm region above @xmath17 to this law yields a value of @xmath45 close to zero . in that approach , @xmath47 is essentially equivalent to the value of @xmath36 .",
    "the double - logarithmic plots of @xmath48 against reduced temperature @xmath49 for all the samples are displayed in the inset of figure 3 . from the slope of the fitted straight line in the griffiths phase regime ,",
    "the exponent @xmath45 for lcco is obtained , which is plotted in figure 4(c ) .",
    "for all the samples , the values of @xmath45 are less than unity , well consistent with the expectation from the griffiths phase model . moreover , it is found that the exponent @xmath45 decreases with the increase of @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath45 signifies the deviation from the cw behavior and higher its value the stronger is the deviation,@xcite this decrease implies that the griffiths phase is weakened as @xmath30 increases , which well agrees with the fact that the temperature range of the griffiths phase decreases upon doping as shown in the magnetic phase diagram of lcco ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this evolution of the griffiths phase with the composition is very similar to those reported in the doped manganite la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 @xcite and la@xmath0ba@xmath1mno@xmath2 @xcite and can be comparable with the @xmath50 phase diagram from the griffiths model.@xcite these features strongly indicate that the clustered state in lcco can be well described by the griffiths phase .",
    "our magnetic studies unequivocally reveal that the fm clustered state above @xmath4 in the ca - doped cobaltites is significantly different from those reported in the sr- and ba - doped ones .",
    "now , let us to discuss the possible origin of this important difference .",
    "usually , the quenched disorder or the competition between magnetic interactions are argued to be the fundamental ingredient in the onset of the griffiths phase.@xcite for example , in la@xmath0ba@xmath51mno@xmath6 , the quenched disorder arising from the size variance of la / ba atoms was reported to be responsible for the development of the griffiths phase,@xcite while in ( la@xmath52pr@xmath53)@xmath19ca@xmath20mn@xmath54o@xmath6 , a close relationship between the fm - antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase competition and the nucleation of the griffiths phase was observed , where the griffiths phase appears as the fm phase dominates and disappears as the afm phase dominates over the fm one.@xcite recently , we have found that a size - induced transition from non - griffiths to griffiths phase exists in sm@xmath55sr@xmath55mno@xmath2 nanoparticles , which is proposed due to the strong suppression of the afm interactions above @xmath4 by the size reduction.@xcite for the doped cobaltites , since the samples with @xmath7 = sr or ba have a relatively larger quenched disorder because of the larger difference in the radii between la and @xmath7 ions , the quenched disorder seems not the origin of the griffiths phase in the ca - doped samples . for the sr - and ba - doped ones ,",
    "the observed upward deviation in @xmath24 from the cw law implies that @xmath43 is reduced to be lower than the value expected from the pure pm behavior .",
    "this reduction is most probably due to the presence of afm interactions .",
    "alternatively , he et al . speculated that the interactions between the antiparallel alignment of neighboring fm clusters could be afm.@xcite we note that in the doped cobaltites the de coupling between co@xmath5-co@xmath9 ions is fm , while the superexchange interactions among is co@xmath5 ions can be afm or fm , depending on whether the splitting of @xmath56 orbitals , _",
    "i.e. _ , jt distortion , happen or not.@xcite in other words , the @xmath56 orbital ordering of co@xmath5 ions with jt distortion yields afm spin correlations , whereas the suppression of the jt distortion will lead the orbitals to favor fm superexchange .",
    "for la@xmath0a@xmath1coo@xmath2 , the jt distortion is strongly dependent on the ionic size of the a - site dopant .",
    "structural studies by the neutron diffractions have disclosed that the jt distortion associated with is co@xmath5 ions are present in crystals with sr and ba but suppressed in those with ca.@xcite this gives a clue to argue that the interactions between co@xmath5 ions are afm in the crystals doped by sr and ba but are fm in the case by ca .",
    "practically , recent elastic neutron scattering on the doped cobaltites indeed revealed that the afm ordered state is observed only for @xmath7 = sr and ba but not for a = ca.@xcite therefore , we propose that for @xmath7 = sr and ba the presence of the afm correlations from the co@xmath5 ions with the jt distortion results in the upward deviation in @xmath24 and hence the non - griffiths - like phase .",
    "however , for @xmath7 = ca , the afm interactions are suppressed due to the absence of the jt distortion , which promotes the appearance of the girffiths phase .",
    "in conclusion , the magnetic studies on la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2 reveal that the fm clustered state exists above @xmath4 in this compound .",
    "moreover , it is found that this state has the basic characteristics of the girffiths phase , which is quite different from those recently reported in the sr- and ba - doped cobaltites where they are non - girffiths - like .",
    "it is proposed that this difference possibly arises from the quite distinct magnetic interactions between co@xmath5 ions in those doped cobaltites . on the base of these results ,",
    "we establish the magnetic diagram of the ca - doped cobaltites .",
