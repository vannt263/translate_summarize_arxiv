    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are the high - luminosity end of the x - ray binary population , with x - ray luminosities @xmath9 erg s@xmath2 , which is the approximate peak luminosity of galactic stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "the most likely explanation for the vast majority of ulxs is that they are stellar - mass bhs ( or neutron stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) accreting well above the critical accretion rate and their luminosity is a few times the classical eddington limit of spherical accretion .",
    "another possibility is that ulxs are powered by accreting bhs up to @xmath10 @xcite , several times more massive than typical galactic stellar - mass bhs ( @xmath11@xmath12 : @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , ulxs may appear more luminous because their x - ray emission is partly collimated along our line of sight .",
    "this may happen at super - critical accretion rates , because of the predicted formation of a dense radiatively - driven disk outflow and a lower - density polar funnel , along which more photons can escape @xcite .",
    "finally , some of the brightest ulxs may contain a population of intermediate - mass bhs ( @xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is difficult to determine the relative contribution of those three factors ( mass , accretion rate and viewing angle ) , and therefore also determine the true isotropic luminosity and accretion rate of ulxs , without at least a direct constraint on their viewing angle .",
    "there is already indirect evidence that ulxs are not strongly beamed .",
    "modelling of the optical light curve from the irradiated donor star in ngc7793-p13 showed @xcite that the source is viewed at an angle @xmath1420@xmath15 and more likely much higher ; thus , in that case , super - eddington accretion is the reason for the high luminosity , not a heavier bh or a down - the - funnel view .",
    "studies of large ( @xmath16100 pc ) photo - ionized and/or shock - ionized plasma bubbles around ulxs @xcite provide other clues about viewing angles : if fast - accreting bhs appeared as ulxs only for a narrow range of face - on inclinations , we would see many more of those large ionized bubbles without a ulx inside ; moreover , the true x - ray luminosity of a beamed source ( much lower than the apparent luminosity ) would not be enough to explain the strong he emission observed from some of the photo - ionized ulx bubbles @xcite .",
    "both the fact that most ulx bubbles do contain a bright , central x - ray source , and the fact that ( in photo - ionized bubbles ) the apparent x - ray photon flux from the central source is consistent with the he photon flux from the bubble , suggest that , statistically , ulxs are seen over a broad range of viewing angles .",
    "x - ray spectroscopic studies can also be used to qualitatively constrain ulx viewing angles : it was suggested @xcite that ulxs seen at lower inclination ( down the polar funnel ) have harder x - ray spectra while those seen at higher inclination ( through the disk wind ) have softer spectra with a lower - energy downturn , due to a higher degree of compton scattering in the wind .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the presence of absorption and emission features ( interpreted as signatures of the outflow ) in the x - ray spectra of ulxs with softer spectra @xcite .",
    "it is also in agreement with a higher degree of short - term variability ( interpreted as the imprint of a clumpy wind ) in sources with softer spectra @xcite .    apart from those indirect or statistical arguments , until recently there was no bright extragalactic stellar - mass bh for which the viewing angle could be directly pinned down .",
    "we have now discovered two such sources , both located in the same spiral arm of the spiral galaxy m51 ; in fact , surprisingly , they appear projected in the sky within only @xmath8 @xmath17 of each other ( see figure [ chand_img ] ) .",
    "both sources have x - ray luminosities @xmath1610@xmath18 erg s@xmath2 , and crucially , they both show sharp x - ray drops and rebrightenings , which we interpret as eclipses by their donor stars , occulting the inner region of the disk .",
    "the presence of eclipses places a lower limit on the inclination angle ( @xmath19 ) as we must be viewing the x - ray sources near edge - on . in this paper , we present the eclipse discovery and the main x - ray timing and spectral properties of the two sources .",
    "we will also briefly discuss more general implications and opportunities provided by the detection of eclipses , for our modelling of these systems . in a companion paper ( soria et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "we will present a study of the optical counterparts and other interesting , newly - discovered properties of those same two ulxs , which show optical and radio evidence of jets and outflows .",
    "m51 , also known as the whirlpool galaxy , is an interacting face - on spiral at a distance of @xmath20 mpc @xcite .",
    "the two eclipsing sources discussed in this paper are those catalogued as cxom51 j132940.0@xmath0471237 ( henceforth , ulx-1 ) and cxom51 j132939.5@xmath0471244 ( henceforth , ulx-2 ) in @xcite .",
    "we re - estimated their positions using all the _ chandra _ data available to - date , and obtained ra ( j2000 ) @xmath21 , dec .",
    "( j2000 ) @xmath22 for ulx-1 , and ra ( j2000 ) @xmath23 , dec .",

    "both positions are subject to the standard uncertainty in the absolute astrometry of _ chandra _ pointings , @xmath80.6 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "a more precise determination of their positions is left to a follow - up study ( soria et al .",
    ", in prep . ) of their optical and radio counterparts .",

    "the higher spatial resolution of _ chandra _",

    "ulx-1 was found to be a relatively soft source , with very few counts above @xmath25 .",
    "ulx-2 was found to be variable , decreasing in luminosity by a factor of @xmath26 between observations @xcite .",
    "further spectral studies of the two sources , based on a 2003 _ xmm - newton _ observation , were carried out by @xcite . with a much larger database of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observation available since then ,",

    "from our inspection of the _ chandra _ light - curves , we have discovered 3 epochs ( obsids 1622 , 13813 and 13814 ) in which the flux of ulx-1 is strongly reduced for at least part of the observation ( table [ ec1_table ] and figures [ 1622_lc ] , [ 13813_lc ] , [ 13814_lc ] ) .",
    "the transition between the long - term - average flux level and the lower level occurs too quickly ( @xmath53 s ) to be explained by a state transition in the inflow , or a change in the mass accretion rate .",
    "our identification of the low state in obsid 1622 as a true stellar eclipse rather than a dip may be debatable , given that the flux drop happens right at the start of the observation ; however , the presence of eclipses is very clear in obsids 13813 ( 2012 september 9 ) and 13814 ( 2012 september 20 ) , which show a low - to - high and a high - to - low transition , respectively .",
    "we also checked that ulx-1 is not at the edge of the chip , there are no instrumental glitches , and no other source in the field has a count - rate step change at the same time .",
    "we conclude that the simplest and most logical explanation is an eclipse of the x - ray emitting region by the donor star .",
    "the flux during the eclipse is not exactly zero : by stacking the time intervals during eclipses , we can find a faint but statistically significant residual emission , softer than the emission outside eclipses .",
    "we will discuss the spectrum of the residual emission in section [ spectral_sec ] .",
    "the way ulx-1 enters the eclipse in obsid 13814 ( figure [ 13814_lc ] ) is also interesting .",
    "the transition to eclipse in the soft band ( 0.31.2 kev ) appears less sharp than the transition in the hard band ( 1.27.0 kev ) : the soft - band count rate drops to effectively zero in @xmath84 ks , while the same transition happens in @xmath541 ks for the hard band .",
    "this can be explained if the softer x - ray photons come from a more extended region that takes longer to be completely occulted than the effectively point - like central region responsible for the harder x - ray photons ; for example , the softer emission may have contributions from the outer , cooler parts of an outflow .",
    "however , we can not rule out that the discrepancy is simply due to small - number statistics .",
    "finally , we find a deep dip in the _ chandra _ light curve of ulx-1 during obsid 13812 ( figure [ 13812_lc ] ) .",
    "the count rate drops to zero and then recovers to the pre - dip level , just like during an eclipse .",
    "however , the short duration ( @xmath820 ks ) and double - dipping substructure of this phase suggest that this occultation is not due to the companion star ; we suggest that it is more likely the result of lumps or other inhomogeneities in the thick outer rim of the disk , or is caused by the accretion stream overshooting the point of impact in the outer disk and covering our view of the inner regions .",
    "analogous x - ray dips are seen in several galactic x - ray binaries and are interpreted as evidence of a high viewing angle .",
    "assuming that the occultation is produced by a geometrically thick structure in keplerian rotation , we can estimate the angular extent of this feature by scaling the duration of the dipping phase to the binary period of ulx-1 .",

    "the abrupt nature of the transition from low to high count rates once again suggests that we are looking at an occultation by the companion star .",
    "remarkably , the egress from the eclipse of ulx-2 happens only @xmath88ks later than the egress from the ulx-1 eclipse , at mjd 56180.30 and 56180.20 , respectively ( cf .",

    "ulx-2 does show significant intra - observational variability in obsid 13815 . throughout the 67-ks observation ,",
    "the source displays a much lower count rate than its average out of eclipse count rate , in both the soft and the hard band ( table 3 and figure [ 13815_lc ] ) .",
    "the count rate further decreases during that _ chandra _ epoch , until it becomes consistent with a non - detection at the end of the observation .",
    "the decrease is slow enough ( compared with the eclipse in obsid 13813 , figure [ 13813_lc ] ) to rule out a stellar occultation .",
    "we do not have enough evidence or enough counts to test whether this flux decrease is due to intrinsic variability of ulx-2 , or to an increased absorption by colder material in the outer disk .",
    "as usual , we checked the behaviour of ulx-1 and other bright sources in obsid 13815 to ascertain that the lower count rate seen from ulx-2 is not an instrumental problem .",
    "we then searched for possible eclipses of either ulx-1 or ulx-2 during the _ xmm - newton _ observations . due to the poorer spatial resolution of epic relative to acis - s , ulx-1 and ulx-2",
    "are not completely resolved by _ xmm - newton _ ; however , the point spread function in the combined epic mos1+mos2 images is clearly peanut - shaped , consistent with the position and relative intensity of the two _ chandra _ sources , and the upper source ( ulx-2 ) has significantly harder colors ( figure [ xmm_image ] , top panel ) .",
    "firstly , we extracted and examined background - subtracted epic light - curves for the combined emission of the two unresolved sources , for each _ xmm - newton _ observation . because the two sources have comparable count rates ( tables 2 and 3 ) , an eclipse in either source would cause the observed count rate to drop by a factor of @xmath82 .",
    "this is the scenario we find in observation 0303420101 : there is an apparent increase in the observed epic - mos count rate by a factor of @xmath82 , some 22 ks from the start of the observation , which we tentatively interpret as the egress from an eclipse ( figure [ xmm_lc ] , top panel ) , superposed on short - term intrinsic variability .",
    "unfortunately we can not use epic - pn data for this crucial epoch , because the source falls onto a chip gap . to quantify the step change in the count rate between the first and second part of the observation ( green and blue datapoints in figure [ xmm_lc ] )",

    "the reason why the residual emission appears less significant in obsid 13813 and 13814 than in obsid 1622 is likely because of the decreased sensitivity of acis - s in the soft band between 2001 and 2012 @xcite .",
    "we stacked the eclipse intervals from all three ulx-1 eclipses and display the resulting 135-ks acis - s x - ray - color image in figure [ chan_res_im ] ( top panel ) .",
    "the residual emission of ulx-1 is centred at the same coordinates as the out of eclipse emission , and is unresolved , but appears softer ( most photons below 1 kev ) .",
    "we also show ( figure [ chan_res_im ] , bottom panel ) the 48-ks acis - s image corresponding to the only _ chandra _ eclipse of ulx-2 ; the signal - to - noise ratio is lower , but there is significant residual emission for ulx-2 in eclipse , as well .     +     to quantify the colors and the color differences in and out of eclipse , we determined the hardness ratio between the net count rates in the 1.27 kev band and in the 0.31.2 kev band ( _ i.e. _ , the same bands used in our light - curve plots ) .",
    "it appears ( particularly in obsid 13813 ) that ulx-1 is softer in eclipse than out of eclipse ( figure [ hard_ratio_fig ] and table [ hr_tab]).the difference becomes more significant when we compare the hardness ratio of the stacked eclipse data ( table [ hr_tab ] ) with that of the stacked out of eclipse ones . for ulx-2 , we can not identify significant color differences in and out of eclipse , because of the short duration of the lone detected _ chandra _ eclipse .",
    "our hardness ratio study also clearly shows ( table [ hr_tab ] and figure [ hard_ratio_fig ] ) that ulx-1 is always softer than ulx-2 , both in and out of eclipse .",
    "another difference between the two ulxs is their degree of hardness ratio variability from epoch to epoch in the _ chandra _ series . for ulx-1 ,",
    "all the 2012 observations are consistent with the same hardness ratio ( table [ hr_tab ] ) .",
    "the source appears softer in obsids 354 , 1622 and 3932 ; however , this is misleading because such observations were taken in cycle 1 , cycle 2 and cycle 4 , respectively , when acis - s was more sensitive to soft photons @xcite .",
    "a rough way to account for this effect is to assume simple power - law models and use the _ chandra _ x - ray center online installation of ( version 4.8 ) to convert the observed count rates into  equivalent \" count rates that would have been observed in cycle 13 ( year 2012 ) when all the other observations took place .",
    "a more accurate conversion from observed count rates to cycle 13-equivalent count rates requires proper spectral modelling in the various epochs .",
    "the corrected count rates listed in table [ hr_tab ] and plotted in figure [ hard_ratio_fig ] , for both ulx-1 and ulx-2 , were obtained with the latter method , after we carried out the spectral analysis discussed in section [ spectral_sec ] ; the best - fitting spectral models were convolved with response and auxiliary response functions of the detector at different epochs , to determine the predicted count rates .",

    "we more plausibly interpret it as thermal - plasma emission , for the purpose of converting count rates into fluxes and luminosities .",
    "assuming a temperature @xmath50.5 kev , and using again the online tool , we estimate a residual ulx-1 luminosity @xmath97 erg s@xmath2 in the 0.38 kev band . again , this is only a simple , preliminary estimate . we will present a more accurate estimate of the residual emission based on spectral fitting , and we will discuss its physical origin , after we carry out a full spectral modelling of ulx-1 ( section [ spectral_mod_sec ] ) .",
    "we do not have any constraints on plausible models for the residual eclipse emission of ulx-2 ; however , a selection of thermal - plasma and power - law models also give typical luminosities @xmath97 erg s@xmath2 .",

    "for each source , we fitted the three spectra simultaneously , keeping the intrinsic absorption column density and the parameters of any possible thermal - plasma components locked between them but leaving all other model parameters free .",

    "instead , two _ mekal _ components with temperatures @xmath146 kev and @xmath147 kev significantly improve the fits ( figure [ b1_model ] ) , providing @xmath148 for the comptonization models and @xmath149 for the disk models . in the latter case ,",

    "lower - energy residuals at @xmath80.50.6 kev are relatively less constrained because of the degraded sensitivity of acis - s at low energies , rather than because of intrinsic absorption . for all our comptonization - type and disk - type models , the intrinsic cold absorption @xmath151 is @xmath152 a few @xmath153 @xmath99 and in most cases , consistent with 0 within the 90% confidence level .    disk models with additional thermal plasma emission produce equally good @xmath52 values as comptonization models with thermal plasma emission ( table [ tab : my_label ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is worth examining in more details whether disk models are physically self - consistent , and what their physical interpretation could be .",
    "let us start with a standard disk , to account for the possibility that ulx-1 is a rather massive bh accreting at sub - eddington rates .",
    "we may be tempted to discard this possibility straight away , because the best - fitting temperature profile index @xmath150 ( rather than @xmath154 ) is generally considered the hallmark of a disk at the eddington accretion rate , not of a standard disk ; however , it was recently shown that broadened disks with @xmath155 may also occur in the sub - eddington regime with accretion rates an order of magnitude lower @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will consider that case here .",
    "in standard accretion disk models , with the inner disk fixed at the innermost stable circular orbit , there are two approximate relations between the observable quantities @xmath156 and @xmath157 , and the non - directly - observable physical properties @xmath158 ( eddington - scaled mass accretion rate ) and @xmath159 ( bh mass ) : @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the bh mass in units of 10 @xmath6 .",

    "the presence of strong line residuals in the soft x - ray band is another , stronger piece of evidence against the standard disk model ; it is instead indicative of eddington accretion and associated outflows @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , we dis - favour the sub - eddington standard disk model for ulx-1 .",
    "next , we test the self - consistency of the slim disk model . in the super - eddington regime ,",
    "the disk luminosity is modified as @xmath168 .",
    "a slim disk is no longer truncated exactly at the innermost stable circular orbit : the fitted inner disk radius can be approximated by the empirical scaling @xmath169 $ ] @xcite . as a result",
    ", the disk luminosity becomes @xmath170 .",
    "substituting @xmath157 from equation , and matching the normalization to that of the sub - eddington case ( equation ) , we obtain : @xmath171 a proper treatment of the observed properties of a slim disk requires additional parameters such as the viewing angle and the bh spin @xcite ; however , equations and are already good enough as a first - order approximation to test the consistency of a slim disk model for ulx-1 . from equation , we find that a slim disk peak temperature @xmath172 kev requires a bh mass @xmath173 ( confirmed also by the numerical results of @xcite ) ; but such bh would be far below eddington at the observed luminosity @xmath164 erg s@xmath2 , contrary to our initial slim disk assumption .",

    "<S> we present the discovery , from archival _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data , of x - ray eclipses in two ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , located in the same region of the galaxy m51 : cxom51 j132940.0@xmath0471237 ( ulx-1 , for simplicity ) and cxom51 j132939.5@xmath0471244 ( ulx-2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> three eclipses were detected for ulx-1 , two for ulx-2 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of eclipses puts strong constraints on the viewing angle , suggesting that both ulxs are seen almost edge - on and are certainly not beamed towards us . despite the similar viewing angles and luminosities ( @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 in the 0.38 kev band for both sources ) , their x - ray properties are different . </S>",
    "<S> ulx-1 has a soft spectrum , well fitted by comptonization emission from a medium with electron temperature @xmath3 kev . </S>",
    "<S> ulx-2 is harder , well fitted by a slim disk with @xmath41.8 kev and normalization consistent with a @xmath510@xmath6 black hole . </S>",
    "<S> ulx-1 has a significant contribution from multi - temperature thermal plasma emission ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath2 ) ; about 10% of this emission remains visible during the eclipses , proving that the emitting gas comes from a region slightly more extended than the size of the donor star . from the sequence and duration of the _ chandra _ observations in and out of eclipse , we constrain the binary period of ulx-1 to be either @xmath86.3 days , or @xmath812.513 days . if the donor star fills its roche lobe ( a plausible assumption for ulxs ) , both cases require an evolved donor ; most likely a blue supergiant , given the young age of the stellar population in that galactic environment .
