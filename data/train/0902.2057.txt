    "according to the models of explosive nucleosynthesis , much of the iron comes from type ia supernovae , while @xmath4 elements such as o and mg come from type ii supernovae . because the difference in lifetime of the progenitors , it is generally considered that the iron enrichment delays relative to @xmath4 elements by 12 billion years ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1998 ) .",
    "if feii / mgii , the relative strengths of feii emission lines and the mgii @xmath2 doublet , reflects the fe / mg abundance ratio , there will be a break in feii / mgii at high redshift . despite of much efforts made by many observational groups",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2003 ; @xcite , 2004 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2008a ; @xcite ) , there have been found no signs of such a break ; feii / mgii looks constant from low - redshift up to @xmath5 with large scatter .",
    "no break in feii / mgii might reflect a significantly shorter delay - time of 0.2@xmath10.6 gyr , as suggested by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the expected break can also be obscured by non - abundance effects .",
    "simulations of feii emitting regions , assuming either photoionization or shocks , imply that the fe abundance is not only one parameter which controls the feii strength , but several non - abundance factors can also affect it .",
    "such non - abundance factors include spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the central source , strength of the radiation field , and the gas density of broad emission line region ( belr ) clouds .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that a large microturbulence velocity may be responsible for strong feii emission .",
    "@xcite have studied non - abundance factors by using spectra of a low - redshift sample of 14 quasars , covering wide rest - wavlengths 1000@xmath17300  , and claimed that the feii strength correlates with the mass of the central black hole , the line width , and the x - ray photon index .    in this paper",
    ", we present spectra of six quasars at @xmath6 , and compare with those in the low - redshift sample . throughout this paper ,",
    "a cosmology with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is assumed .",
    "six quasars were selected for optical spectroscopy from the catalog by @xcite . according to the catalog , these are luminous with @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath10 at @xmath11  @xmath12 , bright enough to take optical feii emission lines through near - infrared spectroscopy at a later opportunity .",
    "gmos on gemini - south telescope are used in the long - slit mode with grating r150_g5326 and order sorting filter og515_g0330 .",
    "wavelengths observed are in 5400@xmath19800  , corresponding to rest wavelengths 1800@xmath13300   at @xmath6 quasars .",
    "the slit width is 1.0  and the spectral resolution is 3.286    pixel@xmath13 . the grating was centered at 8150   for the first three exposures and changed to 8250    for the following exposures , filling up the gaps of the ccd chip array .",
    "wavelengths were calibrated using the cuar arc lamp taken at the both central wavelengths of the grating .",
    "ltt1788 ( @xcite ) was used for flux - scaling .",
    "the observing log is summarlized in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "individual spectral frames were processed using the gemini iraf package ver1.9.1 .",
    "sky of individual frames is subtracted with gsskysub , and then scombine was used to combine into the final spectral frame .",
    "the corrections for telluric absorption were not applied .",
    "reduced spectra are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "redshifts are determined from fit of mgii emission line . with these measured redshifts ,",
    "absolute @xmath14 magnitudes are calculated assuming a cosmology with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "redshifts and absolute @xmath14 magnitudes are also listed in table [ tab : obslog ] .        [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in table [ tab : measure ] , the feii emission line flux _ feii_@xmath15 , the mgii line flux _",
    "mgii(total ) _ , the fwhm ( mgii ) , the 3000   luminosity @xmath16 , and the blackhole mass @xmath17 derived from equation ( [ eq : mclure ] ) , are given . note",
    "that , for b0226 - 104 , mgii emission line is heavily affected by telluric absorption line , so that we did not measure mgii flux and mgii fwhm . a plot of _",
    "feii_@xmath15/_mgii(total ) _ against @xmath17 is given in figure [ fig : femg]@xmath18 and 3000   luminosity @xmath16 in figure [ fig : femg]@xmath19 .",
    "analyzing 14 low - redshift quasars , @xcite found the correlation between the flux ratio feii(uv)/mgii and the blackhole mass .",
    "this relation is shown by the dotted line in figure [ fig : femg]@xmath18 .",
    "filled circles are our quasars at @xmath20 and open circles are low - redshift quasars at @xmath3 by @xcite .",
    "our quasars have an absolute luminosity of @xmath21 , which are much luminous than the low - redshift quasars having an absolute luminosity of @xmath22 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : femg]@xmath18 , the five @xmath0 quasars do not follow the correlation found by @xcite .",
    "all of them have feii(uv)/mgii greater than expected from the tsuzuki s correlation . what is the cause of the large feii(uv)/mgii value in the @xmath0 quasars relative to the low - redshift quasars ? because the five @xmath0 quasars are much luminous than the 14 low - redshift quasars , the luminosity effect is examined .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : femg]@xmath19 , the luminosity effect is not responsible for the large feii(uv)/mgii value in the @xmath0 quasars .",
    "the _ real _ cause would be evolution in feii(uv)/mgii or non - abundance effects such as the sepectral energy distribution of the continuum from the central source , the strength of the radiation field and the gas density of blr clouds as well as the microturbulence of blr gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "further investigations are required using large samples of quasars .",
