    "modern wide - area optical surveys have revealed that the stellar halo of nearby galaxies ( including our own ) contains a wealth of substructures due to the accretion of smaller haloes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "intriguingly , @xcite found that the cluster density profile is much more extended than previously believed and declines , in the outer fringes of the cluster , with a slope that is not reproduced by model profiles generally adopted for classical gcs .",
    "l06 derived the chemical abundance for several elements in the considered star and revealed that it displays [ @xmath0/fe ] , [ ba / fe ] and ( possibly ) [ cu / fe ] ratios significantly different from those of typical halo stars and of the bulk of galactic gcs of similar metallicity , concluding that the cluster has an extra - galactic origin .",
    "this conclusion is clearly very interesting , but it is based on a single cluster star , virtually located at the very tip of the rgb .    to obtain a clear - cut confirmation of the tagging of ngc  5694 proposed by l06 we obtained high - resolution spectra of _ six _ cluster members . in this paper",

    "the data have been acquired with the flames@vlt spectrograph in the combined medusa+uves mode , allowing the simultaneous allocation of 8 uves high - resolution fibers ( discussed in this paper ) and 132 medusa mid - resolution fibers ( discussed in a forthcoming paper , mainly devoted to the internal kinematics of the cluster ) .",

    "we found that the final merged spectra obtained from the eso pipeline are not satisfactory because of the quite poor quality in the overlapping region of adjacent orders .",

    "the determination of the chemical abundances for the majority of the elements has been obtained through the measurement of the equivalent widths ( ews ) of atomic transition lines and employing the package gala @xcite based on the width9 code by r. l. kurucz . for the lines that can not be treated with the ews method ( because they are blended with other lines ) we resort to the comparison between the observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "model atmospheres have been computed with the last version of the atlas9 code , assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for all the species and one - dimensional , plane - parallel geometry . in the flux computation we can not take into account the _ approximate _ overshooting @xcite .",
    "the opacity distribution functions employed in the model calculations are those available in the website of f.castelli computed for a metallicity [ m / h]=2.0 dex ( according to l06 ) and with solar - scaled abundance patterns for each element of the chemical mixture .",
    "all the chemical abundances have been derived under the assumption of lte .",

    "the grid by @xcite does not include the cases with log  g@xmath51 , while three program stars have surface gravity slightly lower than this boundary .",
    "for these stars the corrections have been computed assuming log  g=  1 .",
    "since the corrections are small and only weakly dependent on stellar parameters - in the considered range - this approximation should have a negligible impact on the final abundance estimates .",
    "reference solar abundances are from @xcite except for oxygen , for which we adopted the most recent value by @xcite .      due to the combination of low metallicity and low surface gravity of our targets , a fully spectroscopic derivation of all the atmospheric parameters",
    "could be biased from departures from lte conditions ( as discussed in section  [ nlte ] ) . in order to avoid this kind of problems , we resort to photometry to derive effective temperatures ( @xmath18 ) and surface gravities ( log  g )",

    "microturbulent velocities ( @xmath22 ) have been estimated by minimizing the slope between the neutral iron lines and their reduced ews ( obtained as the logarithm of the ew normalized to its wavelength ) .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath18 are estimated by taking into account the uncertainty in b and v magnitudes and in the color excess .",
    "for the very bright stars considered here , the dominant factor in the photometric error is the uncertainty in photometric zero - point : here we conservatively assume a photometric error of 0.03 mag in both filters for all the targets . for the color excess e(b - v )",
    "we adopted an uncertainty of 0.02  mag .",
    "the total uncertainty ( photometry + extinction ) corresponds to a typical uncertainty in @xmath18 of @xmath350 - 60 k.    uncertainties in the surface gravity are derived by considering the error sources in @xmath18 , luminosity ( including the uncertainties of the photometry and in the distance modulus ) and in mass ( that we assume @xmath23 , corresponding to the typical spread in total mass along the horizontal branch of globular clusters , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "summing all these terms in quadrature leads to a typical uncertainty in log  g of 0.06  dex .    finally , the error associated to the determination of @xmath22 is estimated by propagating the uncertainty in the slope in the reduced ew vs fe abundance plane , through a jackknife bootstrap technique @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty is as small as @xmath30.08 km / s , thanks to the large number of fe  i lines used to determine @xmath22 . to this value we added in quadrature the uncertainty in @xmath22 due to the covariance with the other parameters :",
    "@xmath18 has been varied by @xmath201@xmath24 ( thus leading to a variation of log  g ) and the procedure to derive @xmath22 has been repeated . finally , we estimated a typical error in @xmath22 of @xmath200.15 km / s .      late - type stars with low metallicities and surface gravities ( i.e. approaching the rgb - tip ) are expected to suffer from deviations from lte conditions due to the occurrence of over - ionization because of the uv radiation excess ( basically @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the source function and @xmath27 is the planck function , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the occurrence of these nlte effects thwarts the derivation of log  g from the ionization equilibrium , i.e. from the requirement that fe  i and fe  ii are the same within the uncertainties .",
    "basically , a forced ionization equilibrium in over - ionization conditions leads to underestimate the surface gravities .",
    "for our targets we found , on average , that @xmath5fe  i - fe  ii@xmath28 = 0.13 dex ( @xmath11=  0.05 dex ) . to erase this offset we need to adopt lower log  g values , typically between 0.0 and 0.3 , incompatible with the stellar evolution predictions for a low - mass star in the bright portion of the rgb , in an old and metal - poor stellar system as ngc  5694 .",
    "for instance , the isochrone used to derive the gravities predicts a surface gravity of 0.47 for its brightest point .",
    "note that a fully spectroscopic analysis leads to temperatures lower by @xmath3100 k than those predicted from the isochrone .",
    "also , we checked that this offset can not be a spurious effect due to the adopted log  gf values : an analysis performed on the solar flux spectrum of @xcite , adopting the solar atlas9 model atmosphere computed by f. castelli , provides fe  i - fe  ii=0.01@xmath200.02 dex , excluding systematic offsets between the oscillator strengths of fe  i and fe  ii lines .",
    "thus , we can easily attribute the discrepancy between fe  i and fe  ii abundances in the stars of ngc  5694 to nlte effects .    in order to reduce the effects due to over - ionization",
    ", we decide to calculate the abundance ratios from neutral lines by scaling the abundance on the fe  i abundance and those from single ionized lines by scaling the abundance on fe  ii .",
    "in fact , lines of the same ionization stage have similar dependencies from the parameter ( in particular from the gravity ) . among the elements derived from neutral lines , only the [ o /",
    "fe ] abundance ratio has been scaled on fe  ii , because the over - ionization effects are reduced from its first ionization potential and the oxygen abundance ( when derived from the forbidden o line at 6300.3 @xmath4 , as we have done ) has a sensitivity to the gravity similar to that of the ionized elements ( we refer the reader to the detailed discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "we selected the transitions to be analyzed through the visual inspection of synthetic spectra calculated with the atmospheric parameters of the targets ( and assuming a global metallicity [ m / h]=2.0 dex , with solar - scaled abundance ratios for all the elements ) and convolved with a gaussian profile at the uves resolution .",
    "the selected lines are chosen unblended from other transitions .",
    "oscillator strengths and excitational potential are taken from the last version of the kurucz / castelli line - list .",
    "when available , the van der waals damping constants for the broadening by neutral hydrogen collisions calculated by @xcite have been adopted , and for the other transitions we adopted the values from the kurucz database or , when the van der waals constants are not available in the literature , they are computed by adopting the approximate formulas discussed in @xcite .",
    "after a first analysis , we refine the line - list repeating the procedure of the lines selection by using synthetic spectra computed with the proper chemical composition of each star ; typically , only a few lines are discarded at this step because they are blended with other transitions , and a few new transitions added to the line - list .",
    "finally , the analysis is repeated with the clean line - list .",
    "ews have been measured with the code daospec @xcite that automatically performs the line profile fitting adopting a saturated gaussian function , defined as h(@xmath29)=@xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the value of the gaussian function at a given wavelength @xmath29 .",
    "all the spectral lines are fitted by adopting a fixed full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , that scales with the wavelength , as in wavelength - calibrated echelle spectra the spectral resolution remains constant along the entire spectrum and the fwhm varies with @xmath29 .",
    "the fwhm for each spectrum has been estimated iteratively : we performed a first analysis using as input value the nominal fwhm of the grating , leaving daospec free to re - adjust the fwhm in order to minimize the median value of the residuals distribution .",
    "the new value of the fwhm ( referred to the center of the spectrum ) is used as input value for a new run , until a convergence of @xmath30.1 pixel is reached . after a visual inspection of the spectra and the check of the final residuals , we adopted for the normalization a @xmath32-order legendre polynomial .",
    "we checked that the use of a slightly different degree changes the derived fwhm at a level of 0.1 - 0.2 pixels , with a negligible impact on the ews .",
    "we include in the chemical analysis only lines that satisfy the following criteria :    * ew error smaller than 20% . as ew uncertainty we assumed the error estimated by daospec from the standard deviation of the local flux residuals and representing a 68% confidence interval of the derived ew .",
    "an error in ew of @xmath2020% translates into an abundance error of @xmath200.1 dex for a line located in the linear part of the curve of growth ( typically , the lines with ew errors larger than @xmath310% are the weakest ones ) .",
    "the median abundance error due to the ew uncertainty for our lines is of @xmath200.05 dex ( only a few lines have abundance errors larger than 0.1 dex ) ; * a reduced ew smaller than 4.7 , corresponding to @xmath3100 m@xmath4 for a line at 5300 @xmath4 and @xmath3120 m@xmath4 for a line at 6300 @xmath4 .",
    "this boundary allows to exclude lines in the flat part of the curve of growth , that are less sensitive to the abundance , highly sensitive to the microturbulent velocity and the velocity fields , and for which the gaussian approximation starts to fail , because of the development of lorentzian wings in the line profile ; * a reduced ew larger than 6 , corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 m@xmath4 at 5300 and 6300 @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this boundary excludes lines that are too weak and noisy ; * daospec quality parameter q lower than 1.2 in all the spectra .",
    "this parameter is the ratio between the local intensity residual of a given line and the root - mean - square intensity residual of the entire spectrum .",
    "typically , only a couple of lines have been discarded because their q parameters are systematically higher than the adopted threshold in each spectrum .    at the end of the analysis , the mean abundance ( and the corresponding dispersion ) for a given element in a given star",
    "is computed by averaging the abundances of the surviving lines weighted by the uncertainty on the abundance as obtained from the ew error . for those element for which only one line is available ,",
    "the error associated to the individual abundance estimate is taken as the internal error .",
    "table  2 lists some measured ews and atomic data , the complete set being available in the online journal .",
    "we compare the observed spectra with synthetic spectra to derive the abundance from those lines that exhibit a composite line structure .",
    "the oxygen abundance has been derived from the forbidden line at 6300.31 @xmath4 , including the contribution of a close ni line ( for each star we adopted the corresponding ni abundance derived from ews ) .",
    "odd - z , iron - peak elements ( sc  ii , v  i , mn  i , co  i and cu  i ) suffer from hyperfine splitting and we adopted for those transitions the line - list provided in the kurucz database . for cu",
    "the only available transition is that at 5105 @xmath4 , because the other cu line usually investigated ( at 5782 @xmath4 ) falls in the gap between the two uves chips . for ba",

    "other ba  ii lines are available in the blue part of our spectra but we excluded these transitions because they can be affected by relevant nlte effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we derived only 3@xmath11 detection upper limits for the strongest la  ii and eu  ii available lines , at 6390.5 and 6645.1 @xmath4 , respectively . also for these two lines ,",
    "the modeling of synthetic spectra includes the hyperfine structure and ( only for eu  ii ) isotopic splitting , by using the line - list by @xcite and @xcite for la and eu , respectively .",
    "the abundance for each selected line has been derived through a @xmath33-minimization between the observed spectrum and a grid of synthetic spectra calculated at different abundances .",
    "the synthetic spectra have been computed by means of synthe code developed by r. l. kurucz , including the entire kurucz / castelli line - list ( both for atomic and molecular transitions ) and adopting the same model atmospheres used to derive the abundances from ews .",
    "the synthetic spectra are convolved at the instrumental resolution , then rebinned at the same pixel - step of the observed spectra ( 0.014 and 0.017 @xmath4/pixel for the lower and upper chip of the 580 red arm grating , respectively ) .",
    "additional details about the fitting procedure are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the line fitting procedure has been estimated by means of monte carlo simulations : for each line the fitting procedure has been repeated by using a sample of 500 synthetic spectra where poissonian noise has been injected ( after the re - mapping of the synthetic spectra at the same pixel - step of the uves spectra ) in order to reproduce the noise conditions observed around the analysed line . these uncertainties ( ranging from @xmath30.02 dex up to @xmath30.07 dex , for snr=  70 and 30 , respectively for a line of moderate strength )",
    "have been used as weights to compute the average abundance for a given species or as internal error when only one line is available , as done for abundance estimates derived from ews .    in order to check possible systematic offsets between the abundances inferred with the two methodologies ( ews and spectral synthesis ) we re - analysed with the method described above the fe  i lines for the star # 37 ( taken as representative of our sample ) .",
    "[ testss ] shows the difference between the a(fe  i ) abundances inferred with the two methods as a function of the iron abundances derived from ews ( upper panel ) and of the ews ( lower panel ) .",
    "the average difference turns out to be @xmath34=  -0.013 dex ( @xmath11=  0.047 dex ) ; also , none specific behaviour with the line strength is found .",
    "this check confirms that the two methods provide basically the same results .",
    "the total uncertainty for a given elemental abundance is computed as the sum in quadrature of two sources of error : ( 1 ) that arising from the measurement procedure ( ew or spectral synthesis ) , and ( 2 ) that arising from the atmospheric parameters .",
    "the measurement errors are computed as described in sections  [ ew ] and [ synt ] .",
    "internal uncertainties related to the measurement errors for each elemental abundance are computed as the dispersion of the mean normalized to the root mean square of the number of used lines .",
    "uncertainties due to atmospheric parameters are calculated by varying each time only one parameter by the corresponding error , keeping the other ones fixed and repeating the analysis .    as discussed by several authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when we obtain the abundance ratios ( as [ x / y[=[x / h]-[y / h ] ) the systematic uncertainties related to the atmospheric parameters partially cancel out , because , in general , lines of the same ionization stage respond in a similar way to changes in the stellar parameters .",
    "for instance , the estimated abundance variation due to @xmath35 for the star # 37 is of @xmath36 for fe and of @xmath37 for ca .",
    "therefore , an error in @xmath18 of that amplitude translates into variations of the two considered quantities amounting to just @xmath38 in the corresponding [ ca / fe ] abundance ratio . on the other hand ,",
    "the internal errors due to the ( ews or spectral synthesis ) measurements are independent and they will be combined in quadrature for each abundance ratio .",
    "thus , we provide for each element two different estimates of the total uncertainty : ( 1 )  the uncertainty for the absolute abundance [ x / h ] obtained by combining in quadrature the internal error and those related to each atmospheric parameter , and ( 2 )  the uncertainty for the abundance ratio [ x / fe ] ( where the reference iron abundance is that from fe  i lines for neutral elements and from fe  ii lines for single ionized elements ) obtained by summing in quadrature the internal errors of x and fe , and the relative abundance variation due to each atmospheric parameter .",
    "table  3 summarizes the measured abundance ratios in the target stars , together with the adopted reference solar value and the total uncertainty .",
    "reported errors are the total uncertainties of the [ x / fe ] abundance ratios , while the values in the brackets are the uncertainties of the [ x / h ] abundance ratios ( see sect .",
    "[ unc ] ) .",
    "the inclusion in our sample of the star studied by l06 ( our star # 37 ) give us the opportunity to check the reliability of our abundances by the comparison with a completely independent analysis , based on independent photometry and high - resolution spectra ( from mike@magellan ) .",
    "the elemental abundances for fe , mg , si , ca , ti , mn , ni , cu , y , ba , la and eu have been obtained in both studies , for this star .",
    "the atmospheric parameters adopted in the two analyses are very similar ( @xmath39=  20 k , @xmath40log  g=  0.05 and @xmath41=  0.3 km / s ) .",
    "we find small differences in the iron content , with @xmath42=+0.07  dex and + 0.10  dex for neutral and single ionized fe lines .",
    "basically , these differences are fully ascribable to the differences in the atmospheric parameters ( mainly the difference in @xmath22 ) .",
    "we re - analyse this star by adopting the same atmospheric parameters as in l06 .",
    "considering also the small offset in the employed solar iron abundance ( @xmath43=  0.02 ) , the difference turns out to be of + 0.02 for [ fe / h ]  i and 0.0 for [ fe / h ]  ii .    for the other abundance ratios , the typical offset are smaller than 0.1 dex , except for mn ( @xmath44}_{us}-{\\rm [ mn / fe]}_{lee06}$]=0.22 dex ) and ba ( @xmath45}_{us}-{\\rm [ ba / fe]}_{lee06}$]=0.24 dex ) .",
    "however also these differences are within the combined uncertainties of the two estimates . at least for ba",
    ", the offset can be easily ascribed to the different @xmath22 values adopted in the two analyses , because the ba  ii lines are located in the flat part of the curve of growth and they are sensitive to the velocity fields .",
    "unfortunately , l06 do not provide details about the employed hyperfine structure , oscillator strength and isotopic splitting for the lines derived by spectral synthesis and we are thus unable to properly compare the corresponding abundances .",
    "for la and eu , the spectrum acquired by l06 has a higher snr with respect to our one , thus they are able to properly measure the abundances for these elements , while we can provide only upper limits .",
    "however , our upper limits are consistent with their results",
    ".    it may be worth noting that star # 37 has been recognized as a semi - regular variable by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their v12 ) .",
    "the v magnitude of the star in the 26 epochs sampled by these authors , spread over @xmath46  days , shows a typical r.m.s .",
    "scatter of a few hundredths of a magnitude ( a maximum @xmath47  mag ) .",
    "this suggests that the amplitude of the variation is so small as have negligible effect on the chemical abundance analysis , as confirmed also by the excellent agreement between our results and those by l06 , derived from data obtained in different epochs and as described above .",
    "since the main scientific goal of the present study is to verify if ngc  5694 has indeed a chemical abundance pattern setting it apart from the bulk of classical galactic gcs of similar metallicity , it seems safe to test the hypothesis against a bona - fide , _ typical _ mw halo cluster , by adopting _ a strictly homogeneous analysis on very similar data_.    with this aim , we retrieved , from the eso archive , the uves@flames red - arm spectra of 13 giant stars of the gc ngc  6397 ( that has the same metallicity of ngc  5694 and an abundance pattern typical of the mw halo , see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for this reason , some transitions detectable in our ngc  5694 stars can not be measured in the stars of the ngc  6397 sample because they are too weak in their warmer atmospheres ( in spite of the nearly identical metallicity of the two clusters ) .",

    "the chemical composition of ngc  5694 is remarkably different with respect to the galactic stars of similar metallicity .",
    "in particular , ngc  5694 exhibits at least two main chemical peculiarities when it is compared with milky way ( field / gc ) stars :    *  solar - scaled [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , with the only exception of [ si / fe ] ( that appears to be enhanced with respect to the solar value ) ; * deficiency of neutron - capture elements , both those usually associated to slow neutron - capture ( as y , la and ba ) and to rapid neutron - capture ( eu ) .",
    "since @xmath0-elements are produced mainly in the massive stars through hydrostatic ( for o and mg ) and explosive ( for si , ca , and ti ) nucleosynthesis by type ii sne , while iron is produced also by type ia sne , the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio is commonly adopted as tracer of the relative contribution of type ii and ia sne . in the galactic halo the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio remains nearly constant around [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath56 up to [ fe / h]@xmath57 , where it begins to decline ( the so - called _ knee _ ) , reaching [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath58 at [ fe / h]@xmath58 . generally , the iron content of the _ knee _ marks the metallicity reached by the system when the ejecta of type ia sne are well mixed in the interstellar medium and their chemical signatures dominate the gas , because the type ia sne have longer timescales than type ii sne .",

    "basically , the main contributors to slow neutron - capture elements ( like y , la and ba ) at the solar metallicity are the agb stars with initial mass between @xmath31 and @xmath34 @xmath21 during the thermal pulses stage ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we present the results of the analysis of high - resolution spectra obtained with uves - flames@vlt for six red giant branch stars in the outer - halo metal - poor ( [ fe / h]i=-1.98 and [ fe / h]ii=-1.83 ) galactic globular cluster ngc  5694 , which has been suggested as a possible incomer by lee et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) based on the anomalous chemical composition of a single cluster giant . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain accurate abundances for a large number of elements and we find that : ( a)the six target stars have the same chemical composition within the uncertainties , except for na and al ; ( b ) the average cluster abundance of @xmath0 elements ( with the only exception of si ) is nearly solar , at odds with typical halo stars and globular clusters of similar metallicity ; ( c ) y , ba , la and eu abundances are also significantly lower than in galactic field stars and star clusters of similar metallicity . hence we confirm the lee et al . </S>",
    "<S> classification of ngc  5694 as a cluster of extra - galactic origin . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the first insight on the na - o and mg - al anti - correlations in this cluster : all the considered stars have very similar abundance ratios for these elements , except one that has significantly lower [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] ratios , suggesting that some degree of early self - enrichment has occurred also in this cluster .
