    "spin current generation is an important issue in the emerging spintronics.@xcite recent proposals of the intrinsic spin hall effect are therefore remarkable  @xcite . in the spin hall effect ( she ) ,",
    "a transverse spin current is generated in response to an electric field in a system with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite this effect has been considered to arise extrinsically , i.e. , by impurity scattering  @xcite .",
    "the scattering becomes spin - dependent in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , and this gives rise to the she .",
    "in the recent proposals , in contrast , the she could arise intrinsically in hole - doped ( @xmath15-type ) bulk semiconductors  @xcite and also in electron - doped ( @xmath16-type ) semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite due to intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in the band structure .",
    "this intrinsic she would thus provide a mechanism to generate electric driven spin current without applied magnetic fields in semiconductors , which can be more readily integrated with well - developed semiconductor electronics .",
    "recently , the spin accumulation at the edges of semiconductor samples which is believed to be due to the she , has been measured optically@xcite . further , large she in metallic systems even at room temperature has been detected electrically.@xcite    many theoretical papers have been written addressing various issues about the intrinsic she . in ref . , the she in the p - type gaas semiconductor was explained as arising from the k - space berry curvature in response to the applied electric field .",
    "this intrinsic she would lead to the possibility that the spin - orbit coupling can be used to manipulate spin chirality in semiconductors without dissipation . in ref .",
    ", it was shown that the she in the p - type gaas semiconductor is robust against the disorder based on the parity invariance of the spherical luttinger hamiltonian .",
    "the berry - phase - induced she was also generalized to the case of spinning particles @xcite . in @xcite , an orbital - angular - momentum ( oam ) hall current",
    "is predicted to exist in response to an electric field and is found to cancel exactly the spin hall current in the she . in @xcite , however , _",
    "ab inito _ relativistic band structure calculations show that the oam hall conductivity in p - type semiconductors is one order of magnitude smaller than the spin hall conductivity , indicating no cancellation between the spin and oam hall effects in bulk semiconductors . the spin hall conductivity in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) k - linear rashba system has been shown to be suppressed by weak non - magnetic disorder @xcite .",
    "however , the spin - hall conductivity calculated with the consideration of the vertex correction due to the impurity scattering , does not vanish , in general , and , e.g. , in 2d k - cubic rashba system @xcite , 2d k - cubic wurtzite system @xcite , and 2d k - cubic dresselhaus system @xcite .",
    "very recently , the large she in pt metal at room temperature  @xcite was also theoretically investigated and was attributed to be an intrinsic one due to the band anti - crossings near the fermi level at the @xmath17 and @xmath18 symmetry points in the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the spin precession around the effective magnetic field caused by spin - orbit coupling leads to the fundamental problem that the conventionally defined intuitive spin current operator @xmath19 is not conserved .",
    "therefore , how to properly define the spin current operator has been intensively studied in recent years @xcite . in view of the spin continuity equation  @xcite @xmath20 , shi _ et al._@xcite recently provided a proper definition of conserved spin current to resolve this issue .",
    "the effective conserved spin current @xmath21 constructed from the spin continuity equation is composed of two terms .",
    "one term is the conventional intuitive spin current operator @xmath22 , and the other term @xmath23 which is so - called torque spin current comes from the spin precessional motion . zhang _",
    "et al._@xcite considered the spin hall coefficients for three widely studied semiconductor models , namely , 2d k - linear rashba , 2d k - cubic rashba and 3d luttinger models , in the clean limit , and found that the conserved spin hall conductivities are dramatically different from the conventional spin hall conductivities . for example , in the 2d systems , the conserved spin hall conductivity is equal to the conventional spin hall conductivity in size but has an opposite sign.@xcite in ref . , the results of calculations taking into account the conserved spin current as well as impurity scattering effect for 2d k - linear rashba and k - cubic rashba systems are reported .",
    "recently , we extended the conserved definition of spin current operator and offered a proper definition of the oam current operator.@xcite we also found that in 2d dresselhaus and rashba - dresselhaus systems , the conserved spin hall conductivity is equal to the conventional spin hall conductivity in size but has an opposite sign.@xcite clearly , it is important to consider the new definition of spin current  @xcite and it is of interest to know the torque and hence conserved spin hall coefficients in other 2d systems . in the present paper , therefore , we study the torque , conventional and conserved spin - hall conductivities in all 2d spin - orbit coupled systems described by a generic effective hamiltonian [ eq .",
    "( [ genham ] ) ] within the frequency - dependent kubo linear response theory .",
    "the generic effective hamiltonian covers all common 2d spin - orbit coupled systems used in the literature , such as k - linear rasha , dresselhaus , rashba - dresselhaus , k - cubic dresselhaus and wurtzite - type hamiltonians ( table i ) .",
    "we find two interesting universal relations among the torque , conventional and total conserved spin - hall conductivities .",
    "furthermore , we explore possible connections between conventional spin current and orbital motion of carriers and identify the existence of a conserved hyper - angular momentum @xmath24 in rotationally invariant 2d spin - orbit coupled systems .",
    "the conservation of the hyper - angular momentum @xmath24 would lead to a hyper - selection rule which dictates that the up(down)-spin state in the sense of @xmath25 would be accompanied by the down(up)-oam state in these systems .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define a generic effective hamiltonian for 2d spin - orbit coupled systems and calculate the time evolution of pauli spin and position operators in the heisenberg picture . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the conventional and torque spin - hall conductivities by using frequency - dependent kubo formulae and also present universal relations between these conductivities . in sec .",
    "iv we report our finding that there exists a conserved hyper - angular momentum @xmath24 in the systems with the cylindrically symmetric energy dispersion .",
    "we also demonstrate that the existence of @xmath24 leads to the hyper selection rule for the conventional spin - hall current .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "v. three appendices to this paper outline our derivation of the spin continuity equation , a proof of conservation of @xmath24 and a proof of the vanishing of the @xmath24 current in 2d rotational invariant systems , respectively .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for spin-1/2 particles can be expressed as a linear combination of pauli matrices @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in 2d systems , we consider the following general effective hamiltonian , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , is the single particle kinetic energy , and functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 describe the energy dispersion caused by spin - orbit interaction . in general , @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be expressed as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 s are the coefficients to be determined for each specific system . the einstein summation convention is used .",
    "the general properties of coefficients @xmath4 s are determined by the symmetry requirements .",
    "for instance , time reversal invariance of spin current @xmath33 requires that @xmath31 and @xmath32 must be an odd function of @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "a , we show that the systems described by eq .",
    "( [ genham ] ) satisfy the spin continuity equation : @xmath20 . in table",
    "[ usuham ] , we list the specific functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 for several common 2d systems .",
    "however , we should stress here that the following derivation is independent of the detailed forms of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we should emphasize that eq .",

    "( 1 ) is applicable to the 2d semiconductor structures with the electron or hole pocket centered at the brillouin zone center such as p - type zinc - blende semiconductors and n - type wurtzite nitrides , but not to the metals with a complex fermi surface such as platinum  @xcite . in writing the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we made the assumption that the particle spin-1/2 ( or the pseudospin-1/2 for k - cubic rashba hamiltonian ) lies in the two dimensional plane .",
    "for these spin-1/2 particles , we need only the two component bloch wave function and thus the effective hamiltonian can be written as the linear combination of pauli matrices . since the particle spin lies in the plane ,",
    "the spin splittings induced by bulk or structure inversion asymmetry can be described by introducing the in - plane components of the @xmath37-dependent effective magnetic field , in which they are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the periodic potential and spin - orbit coupling effect would enter the effective hamiltonian via the @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on the symmetries of the underlying crystalline structure and band structure near the brillouin zone center .",
    "since the 2d system we considered is time reversal invariant ( zero magnetic field ) , the spin - splitting would result from the spatial inversion asymmetry ( or structure inversion asymmetry ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are odd functions of k.    for the convenience of derivation , it turns out to be useful to introduce a vector @xmath40 .",

    "nevertheless , we should emphasize that the electric field - induced oam current would not result in magnetization accumulation at the edges of sample .",
    "this is due to the fact that the oam is not an intrinsic quantity of electrons or holes , i.e. , the magnetic moment associated with the orbital angular momentum would vanish when the carrier velocity reaches zero at the edges of sample , as can be understood from the definition of @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic moment accumulation at the edges of sample would come from the spin angular momentum only . in short , it is interesting to notice that the topological quantity @xmath184 is a integer number for k - linear rashba , k - linear dresselhaus , k - cubic rashba and wurtzite - type system , whereas they are 1 , -1 , 3 , 1 , respectively .",
    "the topological number indicates that the constant of motion in 2d rotationally invariant system is the hyper - angular momentum rather than simply the total angular momentum @xmath186 .",
    "it should be pointed out that although both hyper - angular momentum conservation and hyper - selection rule exist in rotationally invariant systems , this rotational symmetry may be broken when higher order terms of @xmath187 are included in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",

    "( 24 ) ] is no longer conserved but the universal relation [ eq .",
    "( 20 ) ] still holds .    in the next subsection",
    ", we will describe the close relation between berry vector potential and hyper - angular momentum .          as mentioned above",
    ", the quantity @xmath25 together with the orbital angular momentum is conserved in a rotationally invariant system . in the following ,",
    "let us explain that the quantity @xmath184 actually comes from the topological properties of the berry vector potential . in the 2d systems with a cylindrically symmetric dispersion , the vector @xmath188 , in general , is perpendicular to the wave vector @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath189 .",
    "for example , it can be shown that the wurtzite type , k - linear rashba , k - cubic rashba and k - linear dresselhaus systems , the dot product of @xmath34 and @xmath188 is zero . in that sense , the three vectors @xmath34 , @xmath188 and @xmath190 form an orthogonal frame fixed on the carrier ( see fig .",
    "2 . ) .    , @xmath191 , and @xmath192.,width=264,height=188 ]    on the other hand , the berry vector potential in a system described by hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ genham2 ] ) can be written as @xmath193 where the eigenvector eq .",
    "( [ eigenstate ] ) was used .",
    "the projection of spin operator onto the in - plane axes contains two terms .",
    "one term is the so - called spin helicity @xmath194 in the 2d spin - orbit coupled system , and the other is the projection of spin on the berry vector potential @xmath195 .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 then comes from the noncommutativeness of the two in - plane projections , viz , @xmath196&= [ \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma},\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}]\\\\ & = i\\left(\\mathbf{k}\\times\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial\\mathbf{k}}\\right)_z\\sigma_z , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the commutation relations of pauli matrices were used .",
    "the overall coefficient of @xmath25 can not be determined by the commutation relation alone . however , in the system with the cylindrically symmetric dispersion , the hyper - angular momentum conservation forces the overall coefficient of @xmath25 to be unity .",
    "similar to the topological force induced by the non - commutative position operator @xcite , the spin part of conservation of the hyper - angular momentum comes from the non - commutative properties of @xmath197 and @xmath194 , whereas they are the projection of spin on the two orthogonal axes .",
    "finally , it must be stressed that in the systems with the non - cylindrically symmetric dispersion , the quantity @xmath25 can also be defined as the non - commutativeness of spin helicity @xmath194 and @xmath197 .",
    "however , in that case , the quantity @xmath25 plus the orbital angular momentum is not conserved .",
    "therefore , the orbital motion of carrier does not accompany with @xmath25 , namely , the hyper - angular angular momentum is not conserved in this case .    the conserved quantity in spin - orbit coupled systems can be written as the sum of the spin and orbital terms . in the free atomic case ,",
    "the spin term is just the pauli spin operator .",
    "when the crystal environment is included , the spin term appears to be different from the pauli spin operator .",
    "it has a non - trivial dependence on energy dispersion that arises from the spin - orbit coupled effect .",
    "we find that the general coefficient is a non - trivial multiplication of @xmath184 in rotationally invariant system .",
    "the quantity @xmath184 is proportional to the expectation value of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "it is of course not surprising that a conserved angular momentum would exist in rotationally invariant systems .",
    "the conserved angular momentum in spin - orbit coupled systems would be the sum of the spin and orbital terms .",
    "in the free atom case , the spin term is just the pauli spin operator , and the sum of the spin and orbital terms is indeed the total angular momentum .",
    "however , we find here that in the presence of the crystal environment , the spin term is not necessarily equal to the pauli spin operator , but has a non - trivial dependence on the energy dispersion [ eq .",
    "( 24 ) ] that arises from the spin - orbit coupling effect .",
    "therefore , we would like to use the hyper - angular momentum here to differentiate eq .",
    "( 24 ) from the well - known expression of the total angular momentum in the free atom case .",
    "furthermore , in the systems described by the generic hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we find that the coefficient in the spin term in eq .",
    "( 24 ) is related to the berry vector potential of the underlying band structure .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived some interesting relations between the conventional and torque spin - hall conductivities for all 2d spin - orbit coupled systems described by the generic effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ genham ] ) in the presence of frequency - dependent electric field . in particular , we find that an universal relation [ eq .",

    "[ usuham ] .",
    "we also found that in 2d rotationally invariant systems , a conserved hyper - angular momentum @xmath24 exists and the hyper - angular momentum current vanishes .",
    "this would result in a hyper - selection rule that the up - spin ( down - spin ) state in the sense of @xmath25 would be accompanied by the down - oam ( up - oam ) state .",

    "<S> we also find that if the 2d systems are rotationally invariant , there exists a hyper - angular momentum @xmath10 which is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the hyper - angular momentum current @xmath11 vanishes , and this leads to a hyper selection rule for the conventional spin - hall current . </S>",
