    "blazars constitute one of the most extreme classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , distinguished by their high luminosity , rapid variability , high ( @xmath9% ) optical polarization , radio core  dominance , and apparent superluminal speeds @xcite . the broad  band emission in these objects , which extends from the radio to the gamma  ray band , appears to be dominated by non  thermal processes from the heart of the agn , often undiluted by the thermal emission present in other agn .",
    "therefore , blazars represent the ideal class to study to further our understanding of non  thermal emission in agn .",
    "the blazar class includes bl lacertae objects , characterized by an almost complete lack of emission lines , and a subclass of radio quasars ( which by definition display broad emission lines ) which have been variously called highly polarized quasars ( hpq ) , optically violently variable quasars ( ovv ) , core - dominated quasars ( cdq ) .",
    "one of their observational properties which is easier to define is the flat  spectrum radio emission ( @xmath10 ) and so we will refer to them as flat ",
    "spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) .    given the lack of prominent emission lines in bl lacs , more than 95% of all known such objects have been discovered either in radio or x  ray surveys .",
    "up work on radio and x  ray  selected samples has shown that the two selection methods yield objects with somewhat different properties . the energy output of most radio selected bl lacs peaks in the ir / optical band @xcite ; such objects are now referred to as lbl ( low - energy peaked bl lacs ) .",
    "by contrast , the energy output of most x  ray selected bl lacs ( referred to as hbl : high - energy peaked bl lacs ) peaks at uv / x  ray energies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that the difference in broad - band peaks for hbl and lbl is not simply phenomenological .",
    "rather , it represents a fundamental difference between the two sub  classes .",
    "the location of the broadband peaks also suggests a different origin for the x  ray emission of the two classes .",
    "namely , an extension of the synchrotron emission likely responsible for the lower energy continuum in hbl , which typically display steep ( energy index @xmath6 ) x  ray spectra , and inverse compton emission in lbl , which have harder ( @xmath11 ) spectra @xcite .",
    "_ bepposax _ observations of bl lacs are confirming this picture @xcite .    in this respect , one could expect to find a similar range in peak frequencies in the fsrq class  for which , until recently , no evidence existed .",
    "indeed , it was suggested by some authors @xcite , based upon the similarities of the optical  x  ray broad - band spectral characteristics of lbl and fsrq , that no fsrq with synchrotron peak emission in the uv / x  ray band should exist .",
    "two studies have drastically changed this picture : 1 .",
    "the multifrequency catalog of @xcite identified more than 50 fsrq ( @xmath12% of the fsrq in their catalog ) spilling into the region of parameter space once exclusively populated by hbl ; 2 . about 30% of fsrq found in the deep x ",
    "ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) @xcite were found to have x  ray  to  radio luminosity ratios , @xmath13 , typical of hbl ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) , but broad ( fwhm @xmath16 ) and luminous ( @xmath17 ) emission lines typical of fsrq .",
    "the discovery of a large population of `` x  ray strong '' fsrq ( labeled hfsrq by @xcite to parallel the hbl moniker ) represents a fundamental change in our perception of the broadband emission of fsrq .",
    "x  ray observations of these objects play a fundamental role in finding their place within the blazar class .",
    "for example , if the x  ray spectra were found to be relatively steep , one could infer a dominance of synchrotron emission , as observed in hbl .",
    "flatter x  ray spectra , with corroborating evidence from the whole broad - band emission @xcite , would instead suggest inverse compton emission . in the latter case ,",
    "the simple equations @xmath18 ( where by lfsrq we mean the `` typical '' fsrq with low - energy synchrotron peak ) and @xmath19 would not be valid , and some more complicated explanation for the existence of this class should be sought .",
    "our previous knowledge of the x  ray spectra of this new class of objects is scanty and mostly based on low signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) rosat data ( padovani et al .",
    "1997 ; padovani et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and is therefore also limited to the relatively narrow @xmath20 kev band .",
    "the _ bepposax _ satellite @xcite , with its broad - band x  ray ( @xmath21 kev ) spectral capabilities , is particularly well suited for a detailed analysis of the individual x",
    " ray spectra of these sources .",

    "spectrum quasars with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath26 values within @xmath27 from the mean values of the hbl in the multifrequency agn catalog of @xcite .",

    "the other definition is based on radio power and appears to be redshift - dependent , with a dividing line ranging from @xmath328 w hz@xmath24 for the palomar green ( pg ) sample ( optically bright and at relatively low - redshift ) up to @xmath329 w hz@xmath24 for the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) sample ( optically fainter and at higher redshift ) .",
    "the two definitions overlap somewhat @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and tab .",
    "1 , all our sources are firmly in the radio - loud regime as far as the first definition is concerned .",
    "all of them have @xmath330 , with @xmath331 ( or @xmath332 ; typical radio - quiet sources [ i.e. , optically selected quasars ] have @xmath333 or @xmath334 ) .",
    "the 5 ghz radio powers of our sources are in the range @xmath335 w hz@xmath24 , with @xmath336 w hz@xmath24 . given their relatively low redshift ( @xmath337 ) , these values also classify our sources as radio - loud .",
    "as described in the introduction , blazars are characterized by a variety of properties , which have also led to a proliferation of names ( hpq , ovv , cdq , fsrq ) .",
    "the flat  spectrum radio quasar definition is the easiest one to apply , and it appears that the majority of powerful fsrq indeed show rapid variability , high polarization , and radio structures dominated by compact radio cores , and vice versa ( urry & padovani 1995 and references therein ) .    as our sources are less powerful than the fsrq commonly studied ( see   [ powers ] ) , it is important to check , as far as possible , that we are dealing with the same type of sources .",
    "we do this in the following .",
    "our objects have , by selection , a flat radio spectrum .",
    "in fact , @xmath338 , that is their typical radio spectrum is not only flat but inverted .",
    "three of our sources are included in the nvss and therefore low - resolution ( 45@xmath339 ) radio maps at 1.4 ghz are available .",

    "the fact that the higher - resolution first flux is similar to ( actually larger than ) the nvss flux suggests that the source is core - dominated ( modulo variability effects ) .",
    "s5 2116@xmath3681 has a complex nvss map , with four radio sources within 3@xmath151  from the source position .",
    "however , dedicated radio observations @xcite show that the vla and vlba ( very long baseline array ) 5 ghz core fluxes of the stronger source are basically the same , again indicating a very compact core .",
    "finally , our own 4.8 and 8.6 ghz australia telescope compact array ( atca ) maps of wga j0546.6@xmath346415 ( 2@xmath339 and 1@xmath339 resolution , respectively ) indicate a compact , unresolved source , with a core - dominance parameter at 4.8 ghz @xmath342 ( see landt et al .",

    "optical polarization data are available only for two of our sources , rgb j1722@xmath362436 and s5 2116@xmath3681 .",
    "the former has @xmath343% @xcite while the latter has @xmath344% @xcite .",

    "[ fig7 ] ) , would also explain a low optical polarization .",
    "as regards variability , at least three of our sources appear to vary in the x  ray band , based on our _ bepposax _ and rosat comparison , with rgb j1629 + 4008 decreasing in flux by a factor of 4 in 7 hours in our mecs and lecs observations .",

    "our fits and the seds are not inconsistent with the fact that the _ bepposax _ band might be close to the `` valley '' between synchrotron and inverse compton emission , which would classify them as akin to `` intermediate '' bl lacs .",
    "finally , s5 2116 + 81 appears to be lbl  like .      a good indicator of the dominant emission process in the x  ray band is the x  ray spectral index ",

    "[ fig8 ] shows an updated version of the @xmath346 plot for bl lacs from @xcite , including the hbl studied by @xcite .",
    "we have also included in this plot our sources , represented by filled points .",
    "we notice that rgb j1629 + 4008 falls right in the region occupied by hbl , again confirming our interpretation that its _ bepposax _ band is dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "this is further supported by the detection of rapid variability , which has been seen in the synchrotron emission of several bl lacs observed with _",
    "bepposax _ but never in the inverse compton component , which varies on much longer time scales ( e.g , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the other three sources have values which , although quite uncertain , are probably in the range @xmath347 hz , which overlap with the values typical of `` intermediate '' bl lacs , but display relatively flat @xmath159 . we notice that the scatter in the diagram is larger in the @xmath58 range @xmath348 hz , which is also where the hbl / lbl division becomes blurrier .",
    "we interpret this as due to the fact that in this range of @xmath349 objects can be both synchrotron and inverse compton dominated , depending on variability state .",
    "for comparison , note that 3c 279 , a classical fsrq , has a _ bepposax _ spectral index @xmath350 and @xmath351 hz @xcite , i.e. , well into the lbl region .      fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows that the thermal component is non  negligible in most of our sources , with a ratio of black  body to synchrotron emission at @xmath352   ranging from @xmath353 for wga j0546.6@xmath346415 and s5 2116@xmath3681 to @xmath354 for rgb j1722@xmath362436 . while these ratios are model ",
    "dependent , especially for the former sources for which the optical band is close to the synchrotron cut ",
    "off , it is instructive to check the effect of the thermal component on the position of our objects in the @xmath355 plane . by subtracting the thermal component and therefore using only the synchrotron flux in the optical band to derive effective spectral indices , we can see where the objects would fall ( we assume that the blue bump has no effect at 1 kev ; but see below ) . as @xmath26 stays constant while @xmath0 and @xmath1 get steeper and flatter respectively , the sources move along diagonal lines up and to the left in the diagram .",
    "more specifically , the `` synchrotron only '' values are as follows : wga j0546.6@xmath346415 , @xmath356 , @xmath357 , rgb j1629@xmath364008 , @xmath358 , @xmath359 , s5 2116@xmath3681 , @xmath358 , @xmath360 ( practically no change is required for rgb j1722@xmath362436 ) .",
    "it then follows that even by subtracting the effect of the thermal component our sources would still be well within the hbl region in the @xmath63 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . actually , the effect of a strong blue bump , by moving sources to the right and down in the diagram , is that of `` pushing '' objects off the hbl region and into the radio - quiet zone .",
    "even with some freedom in the modelling of the synchrotron component , the location of our sources in the hbl region results quite robust , and can not be ascribed to the accretion disk .",
    "that relatively high values of @xmath58 are not due to the accretion disk is also indicated by the low , `` hbl  like '' values of @xmath26 , a parameter well correlated with @xmath58 ( e.g. , padovani & giommi 1996 ) and not affected by the optical contamination .",
    "note that the @xmath58 values given in tab .",

    "ray emission is thought to be produced by a hot thermal corona sandwiching a relatively cold accretion disk .",
    "one could then ask if the same component can contribute also in our objects , two of which indeed have a relatively large disk component in the optical  uv band . while it is certainly possible that some fraction of the x  ray emission ( especially at low energies ) is produced by a hot corona ,",
    "we believe that the non  thermal components in these objects are dominant , due to the x - ray variability indicated by the comparison between _ bepposax _ and rosat data , particularly the rapid lecs / mecs variability seen in rgb j1629 + 4008 , and to the lack of any indication of iron line features and hardening of the spectrum due to the so  called compton hump ( which are instead common in seyfert galaxies ) . a possible way to decrease the importance of the iron line emission and compton hump in the spectrum could be to assume a dynamic corona , but in such case the corona emission would be characterized by harder x - ray spectra ( @xmath171 ; see malzac et al .",
    "2001 ) , and thus could not account for soft excesses or steep spectra .",

    "in powerful sources , where cooling is severe ( high radiative ( @xmath366 ) plus magnetic field ( @xmath367 ) energy densities ) , electrons of all energies cool rapidly ( i.e. , in a time shorter than the injection time ) , making the particle distribution to have a break at @xmath368 , which in this case becomes @xmath298 .",

    "an even stronger non - thermal component would completely wash out the emission lines , making the redshift determination of this object impossible , as there are no galaxy absorption features in its spectrum .",
    "it then follows that a broad - lined source with the same sed as rgb j1629@xmath364008 but a much larger power would not even be classified as an fsrq but as an hbl without redshift .",

    "a key ingredient of this argument is the frequency of the synchrotron peak . assuming a typical @xmath58 value for a `` classical '' fsrq of @xmath376 hz , which implies a much weaker optical synchrotron component , an object with a radio power @xmath4 times larger than rgb j1629@xmath364008 will have the same optical ( non - thermal ) power and therefore will still be recognized as a quasar ( assuming similar thermal powers ) .",

    "we find it significant that , having selected some of the few known fsrq with effective spectral indices typical of hbl and therefore relatively large x  ray  to  radio flux ratios , we found only one case where the x  ray band is clearly dominated by synchrotron emission , with a @xmath379 hz , while the other three sources have @xmath380 hz . as shown , for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , hbl can reach much higher values , up to @xmath381 hz , albeit in cases of extreme variability ( e.g. , mkn 501 ; pian et al .",

    "@xcite reported on _ asca _ observations of four fsrq characterized by steep rosat spectra ( @xmath385 ) .",

    "ray spectra , with @xmath386 .",
    "sambruna et al .",
    "discuss their results in terms of relatively high synchrotron peaks and thermal emission extending into the x  ray band .",
    "we stress , however , that their sources sample a region of parameter space widely different from ours . their effective spectral indices , in fact ,",
    "place their fsrq firmly in the lbl region , unlike ours , so that their four objects should not have been expected to show high @xmath58 values and steep _ asca _ spectra .",
    "@xcite used the fact that these four fsrq happen to have relatively low core - dominance parameters ( @xmath387 ) compared to two `` intermediate '' bl lacs to suggest that these sources could be seen at larger angles than more typical fsrq .",
    "we stress that , as discussed in ",
    "[ blazars ? ] , our sources , and especially rgb j1629 + 4008 , appear to be quite compact so that his interpretation might not apply to our objects .",
    "we have presented new _ bepposax _ observations of four flat  spectrum radio quasars selected to have effective spectral indices ( @xmath0 , @xmath388 ) typical of high - energy peaked bl lacs . the main purpose of the paper was to see if these sources are indeed the broad - lined counterparts of bl lacs with the synchrotron peak at uv / x  ray energies ( hbl ) .",
    "our objects are quite extreme in terms of their x  ray  to  radio flux ratios ( a factor @xmath2 higher than `` classical '' fsrq ) , qualify as radio - loud sources both in terms of their radio - to - optical flux ratio and power , and are variable and radio - compact .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have discovered the first fsrq ( rgb j1629 + 4008 ) whose x  ray emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation , as clearly shown by our _ bepposax _ observations ( @xmath6 in the @xmath389 kev band ) , in which the source was also rapidly variable .",
    "this object is therefore the first confirmed member of a newly established class of hbl  like fsrq .",
    "this result is fully consistent with earlier rosat observations which detected a steep soft x  ray spectrum ( @xmath390 in the @xmath20 kev band ) .",
    "the combination of the x  ray data with archival radio and optical data gives a spectral energy distribution typical of hbl sources , with a synchrotron @xmath379 hz . the derived values follow very well the @xmath391 correlation seen for hbl sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "2 .   the other three sources show a relatively flat ( @xmath392 ) _ bepposax _ spectrum .",
    "however , we have found for two of them ( wga j0546@xmath346415 and rgb j1722 + 2436 ) some indication of steepening at low - energies .",
    "this is based on _ bepposax _ and rosat data and on their ( sparsely sampled ) seds .",
    "we interpret this as the tail of synchrotron emission , which is not strongly constrained but would peak around @xmath8 hz , as typical of `` intermediate '' bl lacs for which the synchrotron and inverse compton components meet within the _ bepposax _ band .",
    "the last source ( s5 2116 + 81 ) turned out to be a more typical fsrq , with the _ bepposax _ band fully dominated by inverse compton emission and a synchrotron @xmath393 hz .",
    "3 .   by fitting a synchrotron inverse compton model which includes the contribution of an accretion disk , whose power we estimate from the broad - line region luminosity , to the spectral energy distributions ,",
    "we have derived physical parameters ( e.g. , intrinsic power , magnetic field , etc . ) for our sources .",
    "the thermal component was found to be non - negligible in three out of four objects , with ratios of thermal to synchrotron emission in the range @xmath394 at 5,000  .",
    "although the original selection was based mostly on the effective broad - band ( radio through x  ray ) colors , which are in first approximation independent of luminosity , all four candidates are at relatively low powers , more typical of bl lacs than of fsrq and in any case close to the low - luminosity end of the fsrq radio luminosity function @xcite .",
    "we interpret this as due to two , possibly concurrent , causes : an inverse dependence of @xmath298 ( and therefore @xmath395 ) , the lorentz factor of the electrons emitting most of the radiation , on bolometric power , due to the more sever cooling at work in more powerful sources ; and a selection effect , namely the fact that a high - power , hbl  like quasar will have such a strong optical / uv non - thermal component that its emission lines will be swamped and the object will be classified as a featureless bl lac .",
