    "young stellar objects ( ysos ) evolve from molecular cloud cores through protostars and pre main - sequence ( pmsss ) to zero - aged main - sequence stars ( zamsss ) .",
    "the evolutional track of low mass ysos can be well traced with the infrared ( ir)-_mm _ band spectra .",
    "class 0 stars ( class 0s ) , the early phase of protostars , show the spectral peak at the _ mm _ band , arising from the gas envelope .",
    "class i stars ( class is ) , the later phase of protostars , exhibit the emission peak at the mid- to far - ir wavelengths , and the spectra are still dominated by the accreting gas envelope",
    ". t tauri stars ( ttss ) are the quasi - static mass - condensation phase after the dynamical mass accretion phase of protostars , and are divided into class iis and iiis ; the formers correspond to classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) , which have a gas disk and show the near- to mid - ir excess emission from the disk .",
    "when the accretion disk disappears , cttss evolve to weak - lined t tauri stars ( wttss ) or class iiis , which have a black body spectrum from the stellar photosphere with the peak at near - ir .",
    "this phase lasts until hydrogen burning is ignited , which is the phase of zamsss .",
    "ttss ( class iis and iiis ) have been known to exhibit fairly strong x - rays with occasional flares .",
    "the x - ray spectra are described with a thin thermal plasma model of a temperature ranging from 1 to a few kev .",
    "the x - rays are similar to , but have a larger flux and a higher temperature than those of the sun , which leads to the general consensus that the x - ray origin is due to the enhanced solar - type magnetic activity .",
    "the x - rays become less active as the low mass stars evolve to main sequence stars ( msss ) ( for reviews , see feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) .",
    "x - rays from class i protostars are discovered with either the hard x - ray imaging instrument on board @xmath12 ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 , kamata et al . 1997 ) or the deep exposure observations with @xmath13 ( e.g. grosso et al .",
    "the x - ray features are similar to those of more evolved stars , like ttss , hence would be also due to the solar - type magnetic activity .",
    "however , more quantitative study on protostellar x - rays in comparison with ttss has not be done , due to very limited samples of protostars ; the x - ray detection rate from class is was only 10% , no x - ray sample from class 0 protostars , the youngest phase of the stellar evolution , has been found .",
    "since the evolution of high mass ysos is very rapid , the evolutional classifications ( or phase ) are not clear - cut .",
    "also the x - ray study on high mass ysos is fur behind those of low mass stars , because of limited samples .",
    "the @xmath12 satellite has found hard x - rays from the center of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , the site of high - mass star formation ( e.g. yamauchi et al .",
    "1997 ; hofner & churchwell 1997 ; sekimoto et al .",
    "2000 ; hamaguchi , tsuboi , & koyama 2000 ) .",
    "however , the limited spatial resolution of @xmath14 , did not allow us to uniquely resolve high mass ysos in the gmcs , due to their relatively large distance and high density of stellar populations .",
    "stellar x - rays have appeared well before the hydrogen burning phase ( msss ) , regardless of the stellar mass .",
    "therefore it may be conceivable that brown dwarfs , the sub - stellar object with the mass below the hydrogen burning limit of 0 .",
    "08@xmath15 , also emit x - rays . in fact , @xmath13 discovered x - ray emission from brown dwarfs ( neuhuser & comern 1998 ) .",
    "however the number of , and the spectrum / timing information of , the x - ray detected blown dwarfs are still poor .",
    "as mentioned above , most of the previous x - ray studies on ysos have been concentrated on the low mass stars in a tts phase ( class iis and iiis ) .",
    "this paper extends the x - ray frontier toward three directions , using the hard x - ray instruments with a fine spatial resolution of @xmath0 : the x - ray emission from high mass ysos , protostars ( class 0s and is ) , and young blown dwarfs ( bds ) .",
    "the study is based on the recent @xmath0 results .",
    "the star forming regions referred in this paper are : @xmath1 ophiuchi ( @xmath1 oph ) , orion molecular clouds 2 and 3 ( omc 2 and omc 3 ) , sagittarius b2 ( sgr b2 ) and monoceros r2 ( mon r2 ) .",

    ", we find 26 class is in the ir - band star catalogs .",
    "thus about 70% of the ir - selected class is are x - ray sources , which is higher ratio than that with @xmath13 psps of about @xmath210% ( carkner , kozak , & feigelson 1998 )",
    ". the high detection rate of class is ( @xmath270 % ) with _ chandra _ is primary due to the high sensitivity , especially in the hard x - ray band .",
    "having reasonable numbers of x - ray samples of low mass ysos ( class i - iii ) , we fit the x - ray spectra with a thin thermal plasma model for all the bright x - ray sources , then find that the x - ray temperatures and absorptions of class is are generally larger than those of class iis and iiis",
    ". also x - ray flares from class is show a hint of higher duty ratio , temperature and luminosity , than those from more evolved class ii and iii stars .    a remarkable finding is a giant flare from ylw 16a with the peak luminosity of @xmath18  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "at the flare , the temperature rises to @xmath19 kev with the 6.7 kev line emission from he - like irons .",
    "we also find the 6.4 kev line of equivalent width @xmath20 ev , which would be fluorescence from cold irons in the circumstellar gas .",
    "since no time - lag is found between the 6.4 kev line and continuum flux , the site of fluorescence should be very near the protostar , possibly the accretion disk .",
    "the large equivalent width favors a disk face - on geometry .",
    "likewise , the 6.4 kev line is a powerful diagnostics for the structure of the gas envelope of ysos .    a larger number of x - ray emitting low - mass ysos is obtained from omc 2 and 3 .",

    "we see heavily absorbed x - rays from high mass ysos , irs 1sw , irs 2 , irs 3ne and @xmath52 .",

    "irs 1sw is exciting the compact hii region with a predicted luminosity of @xmath53 , hence would be a b0 of zero - aged main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "the ir source @xmath52 has been less studied , hence is not well known .",
    "it is associated with a small ir nebulosity and has a similar ir spectrum and bolometric luminosity to those of irs 1sw , hence may be a similar mass star , early b or late o type .",
    "since @xmath52 has no hii region , it may be younger than irs 1sw .",
    "we find that irs1 sw and @xmath52 are strong and heavily absorbed x - ray sources , consistent with their @xmath54 values .",
    "these show a high temperature plasma of @xmath22 - 3 kev and a rapid time variability including flare - like events , in contrast to high mass msss with lower temperature plasma of @xmath101  kev and relatively stable light curve .",
    "we thus suspect that irs 1sw and @xmath52 have higher magnetic activity than that of stellar wind . the x - ray luminosity is @xmath18erg s@xmath4 , which is significantly higher than that of low mass ysos .",
    "irs 2 is an illuminating source of the ir shell .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is @xmath55 , hence would be a high mass yso of @xmath56 ( howard , pipher & forrest 1994 ) .",
    "the infrared spectrum of irs 2 ( also irs 3 ) shows deep absorption features in the water - ice and silicate bands , which is a signature of a cluster of several young embedded sources ( smith , sellgren & tokunaga 1989 ; sellgren , smith & brooke 1994 ; sellgren et al .",
    "thus irs 2 may contain high mass star(s ) in younger phase than irs 1 at zams .",
    "our @xmath0 observation reveals that irs 2 has the highest plasma temperature ( @xmath57 kev ) and the largest absorption column density ( @xmath58 hcm@xmath4 ) among the bright sources in the mon r2 cloud .",
    "large absorptions have been reported from embedded low mass stars , like class i or 0 protostars ( koyama et al . 1996 ; imanishi , koyama & tsuboi 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the heavily absorbed hard x - ray source at irs 2 is very likely to be a high mass yso .",
    "since the x - ray time variation is long enough to be rotational modulation , it may be arisen from the interaction of stellar wind with magnetosphere ( e.g. gagne et al , 1997 ) .",
    "however , irs 2 has neither hii region , hence no strong uv field , nor strong stellar wind .",
    "furthermore _ asca _ detected a big flare from the position of irs 2 , although possible source confusion can not be excluded ( hamaguchi , tsuboi & koyama 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , x - rays from irs 2 are likely magnetic origin .",
    "irs 3 , the brightest source in the near- and mid - ir bands in mon r2 , is another active star forming site .",
    "the presence of @xmath60o and oh masers and a well - developed molecular outflow indicate that irs 3 is till in a phase of dynamical mass accretion .",

    "irs 3 has been resolved into two sources irs 3ne and 3sw , of which the former ( irs 3ne ) exhibits heavily absorbed hard x - rays , hence is a candidate of a high mass yso embedded in the cloud core .",
    "the infrared polarimetry reveals that the interstellar magnetic field is compressed from the neighbor of the gmcs ( e.g. , yao et al . 1997 ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is connecting the stellar surface and the accreting gas disk , it can be twisted , amplified and reconnected by the differential rotation .",
    "then a high temperature plasma is produced by the release of the magnetic energy ( tsuboi et al .",
    "2000 ; montmerle , et al .",
    "the outflow found from irs 3 is also explained by this scenario ( hayashi , shibata & matsumoto 1996 ) .",
    "since the majority of stars in the universe seem to form in binary pairs , one may argue that these high mass stars are binaries with a low mass companion , and the low mass yso may be responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of these high mass ysos , @xmath66  ergs  s@xmath4 , is however significantly larger than that of typical low mass ysos of @xmath67  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "thus contribution of low mass companion , if any , may be a small fraction of the bulk x - rays observed from the high mass ysos .    here we propose a working hypothesis for the study of x - ray evolution of high mass ysos ; high mass stars produce variable and hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - rays due to the magnetic activity in pms ( source b in sgr b2 , irs 2 and irs 3ne in mon r2 ) .",

    "<S> this paper reviews the results of the @xmath0 deep exposure observations on star forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 ophiuchi ( @xmath1 oph ) cloud cores b - f reveal @xmath2 100 x - ray sources above the detection limit of @xmath210@xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> about 2/3 of the x - ray sources are identified with an optical and/or infrared ( ir ) object , including significant numbers of class i sources . the class i sources exhibit higher temperature plasma than those of class ii and iii sources . </S>",
    "<S> these features are confirmed with a larger number of x - ray sources in the orion molecular clouds 2 and 3 ( omc 2 and 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> hard x - ray emissions are found from the sub@xmath5 dust cores , mms 2 and mms 3 in the northern part of omc 3 . </S>",
    "<S> these cores show outflows in the radio and ir bands , hence are in a very early phase of star formation , possibly in the class 0 phase . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are heavily absorbed suggesting that the x - ray sources are embedded in the cores .    </S>",
    "<S> the giant molecular cloud sagittarius b2 ( sgr b2 ) exhibits more than dozen x - ray sources , two of which are associated with the hii complex sgr b2 main ( the ultra compact hii regions f - i ) . </S>",
    "<S> these show an absorption of @xmath610@xmath7 h@xmath8 , which is the largest among the known stellar x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray source in the hii regions f - i shows strong k - shell transition lines from he - like and neutral irons , while that in the east of the hii region i has only a weak line . </S>",
    "<S> no strong x - ray emission is found from any other hii complexes ; hints of weak x - rays are found from only sgr b2 north ( the hii region k ) and south ( h ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the monoceros r2 cloud exhibits x - ray emissions from young high - mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> irs 1 , possibly in zero - aged main - sequence , shows rapid time variability and a thin thermal spectrum of @xmath9 kev temperature . </S>",
    "<S> similar x - ray behaviors are found from younger high - mass stars , irs 2 and irs 3 . </S>",
    "<S> these x - ray features are in contrast to the low temperature plasma ( @xmath10 1 kev ) and moderate variability found in high - mass main - sequence stars .    </S>",
    "<S> x - rays from 7 brown dwarfs and candidates are found in the @xmath1 oph cloud cores a  f , which comprise 40% of those selected with the ir observations . </S>",
    "<S> the x - rays are variable with occasional flares . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra are fitted with a thin thermal plasma of 1 - 3 kev , with the luminosity ratio of x - ray to bolometric of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are essentially the same as those of low - mass pre - main sequence and dme stars .    </S>",
