    "it was realised that certain fermionic particle resonances , based on conventional reasoning , appeared to have symmetric states .",
    "an example , given in kaku @xcite , is the resonance @xmath4 composed of three up quarks of total spin @xmath5",
    ". the state must be symmetric in quark flavour and the spin @xmath6 of each quark must be aligned .",

    "hence the overall state is symmetric , yet the resonance is fermionic . the solution was to introduce @xmath3 colour to generate anti  symmetric quark states . although the existence of quarks is well established , a single free quark has never been observed .",

    "we distinguish this from spatial confinement which accounts for the localisation of quarks to a small region of space .",
    "the latter arises from the dynamics of a theory such as qcd .",

    "<S> the bose  fermi recoupling of particles arising from the @xmath0grading of the irreducible representations of @xmath1 is responsible for the pauli exclusion principle . we demonstrate from fundamental physical assumptions how to extend this to gradings , other than the @xmath0 grading , arising from other groups . </S>",
    "<S> this requires non  associative recouplings where phase factors arise due to _ rebracketing _ of states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider recouplings for the @xmath2grading of @xmath3 colour and demonstrate that all the recouplings graded by triality leading to the pauli exclusion principle demand quark state confinement . </S>",
    "<S> note that quark state confinement asserts that only ensembles of triality zero are possible , as distinct from spatial confinement where particles are confined to a small region of space by a _ confining force _ such as given by the dynamics of qcd . </S>"
