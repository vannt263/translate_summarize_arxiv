    "it is well - known that general relativity ( gr ) is a successful theory in agreement with a great number of observations @xcite .",
    "it describes gravity by means of the einstein - hilbert action , which is proportional to the curvature scalar @xmath1 . when this action is varied with respect to the riemannian metric @xmath2 , one obtains the einstein equations .",
    "it is also well - known that there are two conditions assumed about the affine connection in gr , one is the metric compactibility , and the other is the torsion - free condition . under these two conditions , there exists exactly one connection , namely the levi - civita connection , or sometimes the christoffel connection , on a given manifold with a given metric . on the other hand , relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) is a highly successful theory in describing the electromagnetic , strong , and weak interactions .",
    "however , the framework of qft is basically constructed in the flat minkowski spacetime and interactions are independent of the background spacetime . from einstein s gr",
    ", we know that spacetime itself should be dynamical and interact with other fields through the gravitational field . following einstein s point of view , the gravitational field should couple with all the fields in our universe .",
    "therefore , angular momentum should also have a contribution to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "hence , spinor fields , which carry intrinsic angular momentum predicted by qft , may actually couple with gravity . specifically , we know that in qft , all elementary particles are classified by means of the irreducible unitary representations of the poincar group which has two labels , the mass @xmath3 and the spin @xmath4 . in ordinary gr ,",
    "mass couples to the curvature , whereas spin does not couple to any geometrical quantity @xcite . to treat mass and spin on the equal footing , spin should couple to spacetime metric in some way as a source of gravitational field .",
    "this would lead to a more general theory of gravity than gr .",
    "the einstein - cartan theory is probably the simplest extention of gr which can take both spin and mass into account , providing a more complete treatment from the point of view of the poincar group . but also @xmath5 contribute , in the case of spins , a generalized theory of gravity that honors the poincar group should not only include the intrinsic spin but also the orbital angular momentum in their contributions to gravity , somewhat like that in quantum mechanics . ]",
    "recently , ahluwalia - khalilova and grumiller proposed a novel four - component spinors by means of the eigenspinors of the charge conjugation operator @xmath6 in momentum space @xcite .",
    "they referred to this kind of spinors as eigenspinoren des ladungskonjugationsoperators ( elko ) spinors .",
    "they satisfy @xmath7 and have the dimension of mass . in comparison ,",
    "the dirac spinors in the standard model satisfy @xmath8 with the dimension of mass @xmath9 .",
    "since cpt is anti - unitary for the elko spinors , it restricts the interactions between the elko and other standard model particle , that is , the interactions between elko and the standard matter particles will always be paired in elko spinor and its conjugate . because the elko spinors have dimension of mass , by power counting renormalizability , interactions of the elko spinors with other standard model take place only through the higgs doublet or with gravitational fields .",
    "hence , these spinors are candidate of dark matter @xcite , therefore also referred as dark spinors .",
    "besides , the spin one half elko spinors can couple to all parts of the torsion tensor @xcite unlike the ordinary spin one half dirac spinors that can only couple to its axial vector part @xcite . hence , the elko spinors may provide much more interesting implications in cosmology than the ordinary spin one half fields .",
    "on the other hand , it has been shown that our universe is spatially flat and started accelerating in the recent past .",
    "this conclusion has been backed up by many observational data such as type ia supernovae @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillation @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "to explain the recent accelerated expansion , an unknown component with negative pressure is usually assumed , and called dark energy . in the last years , answering what dark energy really is has become one of the most challenging questions in cosmology .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is a small positive cosmological constant @xmath10 which gives the equation of state @xmath11 where @xmath5 stands for pressure and @xmath12 for the dark energy density . although the cosmological constant with cold dark matter ; i.e. @xmath10cdm model , can explain pretty well the observational data , it suffers , however , from fine - tuning and coincidence problems , in other words , why the cosmological constant is so small and only became dominating almost at present ? to address these issues , cosmologists have considered dynamical dark energy models , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the equation of state @xmath13 is not necessarily a constant and may evolve with time .",
    "most dark energy models are constructed by scalar fields , having @xmath14 , converging to @xmath0 , and the quantum stability of such theories is guaranteed by the energy conditions @xcite .",
    "however , recent models with equation of state @xmath15 and converging to @xmath0 from below , generally referred to as phantom , have drawn lots of attention .",
    "the equation of state @xmath15 is usually realized by a negative kinetic energy , and this counter intuitive assumption violates all the energy conditions , resulting usually in singularities , such as the big rip @xcite , the sudden @xcite the big freeze @xcite , the type - iv singularity @xcite , the little rip @xcite , or the little sibling of the big rip @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a phantom model with equation of state @xmath15 could still be a phenomenologically viable model , for example , as an effective description @xcite .",
    "dark spinor fields as a source of dark energy have been considered by different authors @xcite . however",
    ", none of them consider the elko spinor field with negative kinetic energy and torsion at the same time .",
    "our work addresses the following question : can a phantom elko spinor field embedded in einstein - cartan gravity avoid dark energy singularities",
    "? technically , this amounts to asking what would be the effect of torsion in phantom dark energy models .",
    "we find that in this case the equation of state will not cross the phantom divide .",
    "in other words , we provide an example of a dark energy model with a negative kinetic energy without any potential to produce quantum instabilities as it fulfills the null energy condition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the basic ideas of einstein - cartan gravity . in section iii , we briefly introduce the necessary knowledge of the elko spinor , i.e. , its definition and essential properties . in section iv , we construct a dark energy model of the elko spinor interacting with torsion in a homogeneous and isotropic universe . in section v",
    ", we compute the field equations of this model and qualitatively solve them , studying the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath16 and the equation of state @xmath17 for the elko spinors .",
    "furthermore , we consider the existence of another component , a typical cold dark matter , solving the two components system numerically , and studying the evolution of the equations of state for dark energy , dark matter , and the torsion fields as well as the effective equation of state whenever necessary . in section",
    "vi , we conclude and discuss our results .",
    "einstein - cartan(-sciama - kibble ) theory of gravity , like gr , is based on the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "it relaxes , however , the gr constraint on the affine connection , @xmath18 , to be symmetric in its lower two indices . hence the anti - symmetric part of the affine connection , i.e. the cartan torsion tensor @xmath19}^k=\\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{\\gamma}_{ij}^k-\\tilde{\\gamma}_{ji}^k)$ ] , which is a dynamical variable , independent of the riemannian metric @xmath20 is also allowed @xcite .",
    "the notation @xmath21 $ ] stands for the anti - symmetrization of the tensor indices , defined by @xmath22}=\\frac{1}{2}(t_{ij}-t_{ji})$ ] for any tensor @xmath23 ; similarly , the notation @xmath24 means symmetrization of the tensor indices , @xmath25 .",
    "quantities denoted with a tilde always take torsion into account .",
    "the torsion tensor has 24 independent components in general .",
    "note that we still require the metric compactibility condition @xmath26 , and the metric compactible affine connection with torsion can be written as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the usual christoffel symbol , defined by @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is called the contortion tensor , defined by @xcite @xmath31 note that the cartan torsion tensor is anti - symmetric in its first two indices , @xmath32 , by definition ; however , the contortion tensor is anti - symmetric in its last two indices , @xmath33 . by virtue of the last two equations ,",
    "the inverse relation between the torsion and the contortion tensor reads @xmath34}}^k$ ] .    after introducing the cartan torsion and the contortion tensor",
    ", we can now define the action of the einstein - cartan theory of gravity which is simply the einstein - hilbert action with torsion and metric which are regarded as independent variables : @xmath35 where we set the speed of light to be unity , @xmath36 , the gravitational coupling constant @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the lagrangian density of matter minimally coupled to gravity . before taking the variation of the action , it should be noted that the independent variables are the metric tensor @xmath20 and the torsion tensor @xmath39 , the contortion tensor @xmath30 actually depends on the metric since we lower and rise some indices via @xmath20 @xcite . even though , in principle we should do the variation with respect to the metric and the torsion tensors , it is more convenient to vary with respect to the contortion tensors instead , since the affine connection can be separated into the torsion - free christoffel symbol and the contortion tensor , and the relation between torsion and contortion is only algebraic . thus , we will vary the total action with respect to the metric and the contortion tensors , and we obtain two field equations : @xmath40 where the first field equation is similar to the original einstein equation , we define @xmath41 , which is the einstein tensor with torsion , @xmath42 is the canonical energy - momentum tensor , and the second one is called the cartan equation .",
    "note that in general , @xmath43 is no longer symmetric , so as the @xmath44 due to the fact that affine connection is asymmetric @xmath45 .",
    "we define the modified torsion tensor to be @xmath46 .",
    "the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq.(2.5 ) is the spin tensor @xmath47 , which is defined by @xmath48 the canonical energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the metric energy - momentum tensor , defined by @xmath51 and the second term in eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) is the correction to the energy - momentum tensor generated by spin - torsion interaction .",
    "since the cartan equation is , in general , a set of 24 algebraic equations rather than differential relations between torsion and spin fields , it means that there would be no torsion outside matter distribution with spin source . in other words , torsion can not propagate through the spacetime outside the matter distribution with spin source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we are able to substitute the torsion everywhere by the spin and eliminate the torsion from the formalism .",
    "it then leads to the so - called einstein - cartan equation , @xmath52 where the effective energy - momentum tensor on rhs is given by @xcite @xmath53}-2\\tau_i{}^{kl}\\tau_{jkl}+\\tau^{kl}{}{}_i\\tau_{klj } \\right)\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2}g_{ij}\\left(4\\tau_m{}^k{}_{[l } \\tau^{ml}{}{}_{k]}+\\tau^{klm}\\tau_{klm } \\right)\\\\ & \\equiv \\tilde{\\sigma}_{ij}+\\kappa u_{ij } , \\tag{2.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is symmetric and obeys the usual conservation law @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , note that the einstein - cartan equation can be rewritten without including any torsion term by simply substituting all the torsion terms with the spin tensor terms .",
    "for example , eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) can be rewritten without any torsion term as the metric energy - momentum tensor can be split as a pure metric term plus a spin tensor term .",
    "one can interpret eqs .",
    "( 2.9 ) and ( 2.10 ) as that the geometry is a result from the contribution of the matter field plus some spin - spin interaction . in summary , all the torsion terms disappear in both side of eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) , however , torsion exists on both sides of eq . ( 2.4 ) .",
    "in this section , we will briefly summarize the essential definitions and properties of the elko spinors . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "elko spinors are the eigenspinors of the charge congugation operator in momentum space with spin one half . to be explicit",
    ", we define the elko spinor as @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the second pauli matrix , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the left - handed weyl spinor , and @xmath59 is its complex conjugate .",
    "recall that the left - handed and right - handed weyl spinors are 2-dimensional objects in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 representation of lorentz group , which transform under the infinitesimal rotations @xmath62 and boosts @xmath63 as @xcite @xmath64 the charge conjugation operator is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is called the wigner time reversal operator for spin one - half fields and @xmath67 is an operator that complex conjugates any weyl spinor that appears on its right .",
    "then the elko spinor satisfies the eigenstate equation : @xmath68 the plus sign is called the _ self - conjugate spinor _ , denoted by @xmath69 and the minus sign is called the _ anti - self - conjugate spinor _",
    ", denoted by @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71 is defined as the component of the spin angular momentum in the direction of the three momentum .",
    "thus , the helicity operator can be written as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 are the pauli matrices @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the unit vector of the three momentum . if we choose a weyl spinor @xmath78 in its rest frame to be the eigenspinor of the helicity operator , that is @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 , then from the property @xcite @xmath82 we have @xmath83^ * ) = \\mp ( \\theta [ \\phi_l^{\\pm}(k^\\mu)]^*).\\ ] ] this shows that @xmath84^*$ ] has an opposite helicity to @xmath85 , or equivalently , due to @xmath86 , @xmath87^*$ ] also has opposite helicity to @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , we have two helicity states of the weyl left - handed spinors , one has positive helicity @xmath88 , the other has negative helicity @xmath89 , both of them are eigenspinors of the helicity operator .",
    "hence , for each self - conjugate and anti - self - conjugate elko spinor , this would give us two classes of spinors which can be explicitly defined as    @xmath90^ * \\\\",

    "it means majorana spinor is only self - conjugate under the charge conjugation operator , where as the elko spinors contain both the self - conjugate and the anti - self - conjugate eigenspinors of charge conjugation operator .",
    "therefore the elko spinors could form a basis for the @xmath103-representation of spin one - half particles .",
    "note that the helicity is the projection of the spin on the direction of motion which can be defined not only for a massless particle but also for a massive particle .",
    "the helicity eigenstates exist for any spin .",
    "the distinction is that : ( i ) for a massless particle , the helicity eigenstates coincide with the chirality eigenstates , i.e. a left - handed spinor has opposite helicity to a right - handed spinor .",
    "however , ( ii ) for a massive particle , it is not the case ; the helicity eigenstates for a massive particle are no longer the eigenstates of the chirality , i.e. a left - handed spinor does not have opposite helicity to a right - handed spinor ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , and this is consistent with our expectation of the elko spinor , which is not the eigenstate of the helicity operator and has the double helicity structure @xcite .",
    "next , note that if one uses the usual dirac dual , @xmath104 , for the elko spinors , one will obtain imaginary norms in some combinations of the four elko spinors , for instance , @xmath105 . in order to construct the lagrangian",

    "the new dual is unique and has the following properties : ( i ) it yields an invariant real definite norm , and , ( ii ) it yields a positive - definite norm for two of the four elko spinors , and negative - definite norm for the remaining two . with the definition of the new dual for the elko spinors",

    "therefore , we can assume that the elko spinor fields in our model depend only on time , @xmath170 , writing @xmath183 and @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is a real function and @xmath186 is a constant elko spinor and its elko dual @xmath187 is defined by eq .",
    "since the cosmological principle implies the off - diagonal components of the einstein tensor to vanish , for example @xmath188 , it naturally constrains the energy - momentum tensor on the rhs of the field equation , eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) . that is to say ,",
    "the off - diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor should also vanish even in absence of torsion .",
    "to be precise , this means that the elko spinor is required to satisfy the condition that the off - diagonal components of the metric energy - momentum tensor should also vanish , i.e. @xmath189 the simplest way to satisfy this condition is to assume the so - called dark ghost spinor which is the elko spinor with zero norm , @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "the word `` ghost '' refers to the fact that it has no contribution to the metric energy - momentum tensor and thus has no effect on the curvature of spacetime in the absence of torsion @xcite .",
    "a cosmological dark ghost spinor can be given by @xcite @xmath191 with its corresponding dual spinor @xmath192 since the norm of the dark ghost spinor vanishes , the potential @xmath193 which is a function of @xmath152 plays a role similar to that of the cosmological constant .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 4.22 ) is based on the consistency of the cosmological principle , i.e. our universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scale , therefore only the time dependence degree of freedom remains .",
    "besides , the energy - momentum tensor has also to be compatible with the cosmological principle , thus the zero - norm is a natural choice .",
    "however , a standard elko spinor with non - vanishing norm may also satisfy the condition that the off - diagonal components of the metric energy - momentum tensor vanish , in that case , higher order self - interactions are allowed .",
    "the cartan equation ( 2.5 ) is in general a set of 24 algebraic equations , however , using eq .",
    "( 4.18 ) , it reduces to two independent equations relating torsion and spin tensors . using eq .",
    "( 4.22 ) , we can solve the torsion functions in terms of the matter field @xmath185 .",
    "indeed , after some lengthy calculation we get @xmath194 here , we can see that the dark ghost spinor indeed has non - trivial contributions to both the spatial axial components and to the temporal components of the torsion tensor as compared with the dirac spinor which has only a contribution to the spatial axial vector components of the torsion tensor @xcite",
    ". moreover , the non - trivial components of the spin angular momentum tensor in our model are @xmath195 and @xmath196 , which are of ocurse homogeneous and isotropic in agreement with the cosmological principle . to obtain the canonical energy - momentum tensor",
    ", we need to compute the contributions of the spin angular momentum taking into account the torsion interactions , @xmath197 .",
    "finally , we obtain that the non - vanishing components reads @xmath198 where @xmath199 .",
    "we will analyze the dynamics of our dark energy model in the next section .",
    "the evolution of the hubble parameter , @xmath200 , can be determined from einstein equation ( 2.4 ) .",
    "the corresponding friedmann and raychaudhuri equations read @xmath201 the evolution of the matter field @xmath185 can be obtained by taking the time derivative of eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) and equating it to eq . ( 5.2 ) , then @xmath202 eq . ( 5.3 ) gives the evolution of the matter field , combining it with eq .",
    "( 5.1 ) , one obtains a differential equation for the scale factor in terms of the matter field @xmath185 @xmath203 solving the above differential equation we obtain @xmath204^{\\frac{1}{9}},\\ ] ] where @xmath205 is an integration constant .",
    "as we previously mentioned , the einstein - cartan equation ( 2.9 ) can be interpreted as that the geometry is the result from the contribution of the matter fields plus some spin - spin interaction .",
    "therefore for a homogeneous and isotropic universe , we can define for example an equation of state for dark energy , @xmath206 , related to the elko spinor from the metric energy - momentum tensor given in eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) where @xmath207 , and @xmath208 , then we have @xmath209 this equation of state does not take into account the spin - spin interaction ; i.e. the energy momentum tensor @xmath210 defined in eq . ( 2.10 ) .",
    "we could equally define a spin - spin effective equation of state related to @xmath210 which we omit here for simplicity .    since @xmath211 is constrained by eq.(5.3 ) to satisfy the condition @xmath212 , the time derivative of @xmath211 is always negative ( please c.f .",
    "again eq . ( 5.3 ) ) , then @xmath211 will decrease .",
    "in fact , @xmath211 will monotonically decrease to its lower bound , @xmath213 , as time goes to infinity , as we next show in eq .",

    "5.3 ) from @xmath214 to @xmath215 with @xmath216 , and @xmath217 . ]",
    "then , @xmath206 goes to @xmath218 asymptotically , the hubble parameter is almost a constant , and the scale factor expands as @xmath219 , therefore our universe enters a de sitter phase at late time . from the positivity of the second term on rhs in eq .",
    "( 5.6 ) , we see that the equation of state will be always larger than -1 . and",
    "if we consider the contribution of spin - spin interaction , we can define the total equation of state @xmath220 from @xmath221 , then @xmath222 since both definitions of equation of state show that our dynamical dark energy model does not cross the phantom divide , we do not expect quantum instabilities even though the kinetic energy is negative , cf .",
    "note that in a finite cosmic time , @xmath211 will never become zero , therefore , neither the hubble parameter nor its time derivative diverge at a finite cosmic time , hence this model is free from the big rip singularity @xcite .",
    "indeed , the universe would be asymptotically de sitter in this model .",
    "we can expand eqs .",
    "( 5.1 ) and ( 5.3 ) around @xmath223 to the first few orders to see its qualitative behavior , @xmath224 solving these differential equations to the first order , we obtain @xmath225 we see that as time goes to infinity , @xmath185 exponentially decays , so do the torsion functions @xmath226 and @xmath227 ; cf .",
    "( 4.24 ) and ( 4.25 ) .",
    "it is not surprising because as the spin sources dilutes the torsion will vanish accordingly @xcite .",
    "we next consider the existence of some kind of cold dark matter given by a perfect fluid of a spin-0 particle with the energy - momentum tensor given by @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is its energy density . since it has spin zero , it has no extra contribution to the torsion by the cartan equation , eq.(2.5 ) , it only has an additive contribution to the total energy - momentum tensor , @xmath230 in eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) , that is @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the metric energy - momentum tensor of the elko spinor defined in eq . (",

    "( 5.1 ) and ( 5.3 ) , are modified as @xmath233 where @xmath234 while eq .",
    "( 5.2 ) remain unchanged .",
    "we define the total equation of state of the universe by using again @xmath235 , which gives @xmath236    the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath237 reads @xmath238 substituting @xmath239 using eq .",

    "we linearize the system around the fixed point , by expanding @xmath244 , and we obtain that @xmath245 the linearized system is automatically diagonal , one can easily read off its eigenvalues , both are real and negative . therefore , @xmath246 is an attractive fixed point , and this would give us @xmath247 in the future . as the universe expands , the torsion will vanish . when both @xmath211 and @xmath248 are small , the hubble parameter will be nearly constant , the scale factor @xmath165 grows exponentially which means the universe will again enter a de sitter phase .    the numerical evolution of the equation of state , @xmath249 , and the hubble parameter @xmath250 of the universe with redshift @xmath251 shown in fig . 2 and 3 respectively where @xmath205 stands for the present value of the scale factor .",
    "note that for @xmath252 , the conservation equation , @xmath253 , can be interpreted as the continuity equation of the energy density of the elko spinor with a source term , @xmath254 where @xmath255 means energy is transferred from torsion to elko fields , and @xmath256 means no interaction between torsion and elko fields .",
    "we can as well define an equation of state for dark energy again as @xmath257 , then @xmath258 we can as well define an effective equation of state for dark energy @xmath259 , then @xmath260 the term , @xmath261 , is equally present when @xmath262 ; i.e. in the absence of dark matter . the numerical evolution of @xmath17 and @xmath263 with redshift @xmath264 are given in figs .",

    "in this paper , we consider einstein - cartan theory , which is a simple generalization of ordinary general relativity , incorporated with the torsion fields as the anti - symmetric part of the affine connection .",
    "in such a theory , there are two field equations , one is like the traditional einstein equation and the other an algebraic relation between the torsion fields and the spin fields of the matter sources .",
    "we introduce a new kind of spin one - half particle called the elko spinor or dark spinor which is the eigenspinor of the charge conjugation operator , and different from the majorana spinor due to the double - helicity structure @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion of the elko spinor is the klein - gordon equation rather than the dirac equation .",
    "then , we propose a dark energy model with a negative kinetic energy constructed from the elko spinor that interacts with the torsion fields in a flrw universe .",
    "although the kinetic energy is negative , the equation of states @xmath17 and @xmath275 do not cross the phantom divide and approaches @xmath218 asymptotically , satisfying the weak energy condition , hence we expect the model to be stable at the quantum level .",
    "no big rip singularity will occur at a finite cosmic time in this setup .",
    "torsion will vanish at late time , and the hubble parameter will approach a constant asymptotically .",
    "furthermore , we consider the existence of some cold dark matter which is assumed to be a pressureless scalar particle without contribution to the torsion fields . in this two components system",
    ", we find that there is a unique attractive fixed point , which is simply @xmath246 , and all of the equations of state @xmath275 , @xmath17 , and @xmath263 will converge to @xmath218 from above no matter what the initial condition is . therefore , the universe will eventually enter a de sitter phase at late time with or without dark matter .    on this work , we assumed a constant potential in eq .",
