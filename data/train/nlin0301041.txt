    "note that the resonances are real or appear as complex conjugated pairs .",
    "the averaged phase - space overlaps ( [ sccorr ] ) might be understood as a scar correlation function .",
    "due to the schwarz inequality ( [ schwarz ] ) the probability to find a pair of scarred eigenfunctions becomes large if the difference of their eigenenergies is close to the phase of a resonance of large modulus , i.e. close to the position of a strongly peaked lorentzian .",

    "coincide , while the peak corresponding to the coupling resonance is much sharper for the prediction from traces calculated with the use of periodic orbits .",
    "this is due to the fact that the approximate resonance in question has not reached the final resonance position which is calculated analytically ( cf .",

    "[ sec : traces ] we here consider three systems : baker map on the sphere and its modifications with positive and negative coupling . for all cases",

    "[ fig : hspek0][fig : hspekn ] .",
    "the averaged overlaps are scaled such that the rmt average is equal to unity . up to small fluctuations most of the quantum results coincide with the semiclassical predictions .",
    "however , not for every system the quality of the agreement between the semiclassical prediction and the quantum results is the same . whereas the agreement is fine for the system with positive coupling , the mean resonant peak of the husimi overlaps approximated by periodic orbits for system ( [ eq : bsdef ] ) is higher than the peak observed in the quantum results , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hspekn ] . on the other hand , the prediction derived by classical resonances obtained by the weak noise approach approximate well the quantum results for all systems studied .",
    "in other words , quantum uncertainty acts similarly as a stochastic perturbation of the classical system .",
    "as it has been explained in the foregoing sections the exchange of probability between the two hemispheres is responsible for a resonance .",
    "we here study a simplification of the system of coupled baker maps .",
    "the internal dynamics , i.e. the baker maps itself , and their corresponding resonances are not the point of interest here .",
    "therefore we replace the quantized baker maps ( i.e. the operators  ( [ eq : hatbn ] ) and ( [ eq : hatbs ] ) ) by random matrices .",
    "this simplification might be motivated as follows .",
    "consider a strongly chaotic classical system for which all classical correlations become arbitrary small already after one iteration of the map .",
    "quantizing such a  system we expect a  random - matrix like behaviour , since all resonances should be located close to the origin and therefore no semiclassical corrections will appear .",
    "a realization of such a system can be constructed by a sequence of several uncoupled baker maps @xmath202 ( lyapunov exponent @xmath203 ) followed by a coupling operator .",
    "in contrast to the coupled baker maps the coupled random matrices ( crm ) are more advantageous .",
    "the resonances are easy to calculate as it will be shown in the sequel .",
    "moreover , we have the opportunity to average over an ensemble of arbitrary many coupled random matrices .    for the classical counterpart of crm we separate the phase space into two partitions of equal area . on the sphere we may choose the northern and southern hemisphere . a strongly chaotic dynamics acts separately on each hemisphere .",
    "the classical system can be described by stochastic matrices . to that end",
    "we separate the phase space into @xmath204 cells , where we conveniently choose @xmath39 sectors of same area on each hemisphere , for instance @xmath205 for the northern and @xmath206 for the southern hemisphere , see fig .",

    "the eigenvalues of this shifted matrix are easily calculated .",
    "since the matrix is still of rank 2 , @xmath222 eigenvalues are equal to zero .",
    "one eigenvalue must be 1 , because the matrix is double stochastic .",

    "such long - lived excitations have a strong impact on the corresponding quantum dynamics .",
