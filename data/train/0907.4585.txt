    "_ experimental evidence that ( exclusive ) form factors of hadrons consisting of @xmath1 quarks behave like @xmath2 for large @xmath3 , provokes expectations that there is a fundamental and/or easily visible reason for such a phenomenon , scale invariance being the most natural suspect@xcite",
    ". indeed , hard rescattering in a theory with spinor constituents and dimensionless coupling constant for their interaction with an intermediary boson field provides a specific dynamical mechanism@xcite that produces the @xmath2 behavior . in this approach",
    ", @xmath4 is just the number of hard exchanges .",
    "another property apparently correlated with the number of quarks in the hadron is the @xmath5 behavior of the ( inclusive ) quark distributions functions in the @xmath6 region .",
    "this observation suggests to look for connection between these exclusive and inclusive observables .",
    "below in this section we discuss scenarios which display two versions of exclusive - inclusive correlation . in subsequent sections , we discuss derivation of the @xmath0 behavior for meson form factors in ads / qcd .    _ soft mechanism . _ powerlike behavior of hadronic form factors due to feynman mechanism @xcite can be derived from the drell - yan formula @xcite @xmath7 which represents form factor in terms of the light - front wave function @xmath8 and light - front variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 . when the wave function @xmath8 rapidly ( say , exponentially ) decreases for @xmath11 , it is natural to consider the region where both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are maximal : @xmath14 @xmath15 is small and @xmath16 @xmath17 is close to 0 , so that @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 then @xmath20 the parton distribution functions in this formalism are given by the integral of @xmath21 over @xmath10 .",
    "the latter is dominated by @xmath22 , hence thus , changing the shape of @xmath23 , one would change the result for form factor . in other words , there is a _ causal relation _ between the @xmath24 shape of the distribution function @xmath23 and the @xmath25 behavior of the form factor @xmath26 : form of @xmath23 determines @xmath26 .    _",
    "hard mechanism .",
    "_ for the feynman / dy mechanism it was important that the fraction @xmath27 vanishes in the @xmath28 limit .",
    "consider now the regions in dy formula ( [ dy ] ) , in which the fraction @xmath29 is finite , while the transverse momentum argument of one of the wave functions is small , e.g. , the region @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is maximal .",
    "then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the relevant distribution amplitude . in this scenario ,",
    "the form factor repeats large-@xmath10 behavior of the hadron wave function , e.g. , if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 .",
    "this mechanism was proposed by g.b .",
    "west @xcite , who used , in fact , a covariant bethe - salpeter ( bs ) formalism rather than light - front variables , writing the form factor as@xcite @xmath36        where @xmath37 is treated as a function of the active parton virtuality @xmath38 and spectator mass @xmath39 . assuming that @xmath40 for large @xmath41 , west concludes that @xmath42 : form factor repeats the large-@xmath3 behavior of the bs wave function @xmath43 .",
    "for the deep inelastic structure function , west obtains@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46 being the nucleon mass . as a result , @xmath47",
    ".     _ dy vs west s model .",
    "_ if @xmath48 , the power - law predictions of the two models formally coincide",
    ". however , these results were obtained from completely different assumptions . in dy picture , the active parton is `` on - shell '' both before and after the collision : both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are of order @xmath51 , and form factor @xmath26 reflects the _ size of phase space _ region in which @xmath52 . on the other hand , in west s model ,",
    "the active parton is highly virtual either in initial or final state , and @xmath26 reflects the @xmath41-dependence of wf for large virtualities @xmath53 .",
    "still , though the two mechanisms are completely different , the connection ( `` drell - yan - west relation '' ) holds in both models ! )",
    "is often referred to as `` drell - yan - west formula '' , which is absolutely incorrect because its crucial feature is incorporation of light - front variables that west did not use . ]",
    "it should be also emphasized that in west s model , @xmath54 and @xmath55 have the same cause ( large-@xmath41 behavior of @xmath37 ) , but they are not `` causing '' each other .    _",
    "west s hard mechanism & pqcd .",
    "_ in dy model , @xmath56 is not necessarily integer .",
    "integer values of @xmath56 naturally appear in west s hard scenario , where they are related to the number of hard propagators .",
    "in particular , hard exchange in a theory with a dimensionless coupling constant gives @xmath57 [ ] , which is a consequence of scale invariance@xcite .",
    "in quantum chromodynamics , each hard gluon exchange is accompanied by effective coupling constant @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 . according to explicit calculation@xcite , the asymptotic prediction for the pion form factor in pqcd is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "compared to the vmd expectation @xmath62 , pqcd prediction is suppressed by @xmath63 factor .",
    "it is well known that the factor @xmath64 is penalty for an extra loop , which suggests that the hard one - gluon - exchange contribution is an @xmath65 correction to some @xmath66 term .",
    "the only candidate is the feynman / dy soft contribution , which should be calculated in a nonperturbative way . in particular , in holographic ads",
    "/ qcd models considered in refs .",
    "[ ] one has @xmath67 , without a suppression factor .",
    "models based on ads / cft correspondence are often claimed to provide nonperturbative explanation of quark counting rules for form factors that is based on conformal invariance and short - distance behavior of normalizable modes @xmath68 playing the role of wave functions of initial and final hadrons .",
    "namely , in the model of polchinski and strassler@xcite ( that involves on the ads side scalar fields only ) one has@xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is nonnormalizable mode describing the probing em current , and normalizable modes for mesons are given by @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 being standard bessel functions .",
    "for large @xmath74 , one may approximate @xmath75 , and it is clear that only small @xmath76 contribute . as a result , for the ground state . but",
    "this is not the @xmath0 power that one is longing to get ! to bring the result of this ads / cft - based model in agreement with pqcd expectations , brodsky and de teramond proposed@xcite to modify the basic principle of ads / cft correspondence , requiring that the dimension of the operator on the ads side should be equal to the twist of the corresponding current in the 4-dimensional theory rather than to its dimension . in our papers with h.r .",
