    "the outer branch of the entropy profile is described by a linear decline of the slope with gradient @xmath37 . this lower entropy production may be explained in terms of decreasing accretion rate due to the slowdown at later cosmic times of the cosmological structure growth in an accelerating universe .",

    "( 2013 ) found relaxed clusters consistent with no bias when hydrostatic and weak lensing masses are compared at @xmath7 .",
    "but , we believe that the increasing radial profile of @xmath64 reported by the simulations may give hydrostatic masses that bias low at the virial radius .",
    "this is supported by the differences between @xmath99 and @xmath100 at @xmath7 and @xmath21 in the relaxed abell 1835 ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this difference is negligible at @xmath7 and much evident at @xmath21 .    in summary ,",
    "we have shown how the analysis of the x - ray observables allows to derive a total mass profile consistent with the weak lensing measurements , and to trace the thermal and nonthermal pressure profiles .",
    "this can be obtained on introducing in the he equation a nonthermal pressure support as allowed by our supermodel .",
    "in particular , we have reconstructed from _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations the gas and total mass profiles of abell 1835 .",
    "the values of @xmath42 and @xmath39 that defines the nonthermal pressure component have been obtained by the condition that @xmath0 equals @xmath8 - @xmath4 at the virial radius .",
    "we have also shown that the level of turbulence @xmath42 depends on the observed icp temperature profile .",
    "a steep drop in @xmath101 implies a decreasing mass profile and therefore a high level of turbulence is required to obtain an increasing cluster mass profile that satisfies the cosmic gas mass fraction at the virial boundary .",
    "a lower level is necessary for a smoother decline of the temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the weakening of the accretion shocks that leads to a reduction of the thermal energy to feed the icp entropy and to an increase of the bulk energy to drive turbulence in the cluster outskirts . as discussed in sect .",
    "2 , the weakening degree of the accretion shocks may depend on the cluster environment and this seems to be confirmed by the significant azimuthal variations of the electron density , temperature and entropy reported by _ suzaku _ ( ichikawa et al . 2013 ) .",
    "using the sdss photometric data for abell 1835 and abell 1689 , the authors found that the hot regions are associated with a filamentary structure , while the cold regions contact low - density regions outside the clusters .",
    "finally , the increasing @xmath0 profile at @xmath102 reported in fig .",
    "3 confirms the conclusion of rasheed et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that the baryons are not missing .",
    "they are simply located in the most peripheral regions of the clusters likely for the heating processes ( such as shocks - heating of the gas , supernovae and agn feedback ) that cause the icp to expand or hinder its inflow .",
    "we thank our referee for constructive comments .",
    "we are grateful to massimiliano bonamente for the submission of data on the _ chandra _ brightness distribution and to mauro sereno for clarifying discussions .",
