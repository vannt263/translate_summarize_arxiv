    "an accurate calculation using a simple formalism is naturally desired in all phenomenological studies of nuclear and particle physics . however , in most cases this is difficult to achieve , because an accurate calculation usually does not allow for any extreme approximation .",
    "therefore , an optimal approximation which only includes the most important parts of the formalism , without sacrificing the accuracy of the numerical result , should be obtained .",
    "a good example is found in the analysis of the hypertriton photo- and electroproduction , i.e. , @xmath2 given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this analysis",
    "the cross section is calculated by means of the elementary operator kaon - maid  @xcite sandwiched between two nuclear wave functions ( @xmath3he and @xmath4h ) obtained from the solutions of faddeev equations using modern nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - nucleon potentials  @xcite .",
    "the numbers of partial waves for the @xmath3he and @xmath4h wave functions are 34 and 16 , respectively . along with the corresponding probabilities",
    "these partial waves are shown in table  [ probability_wf ] . in both wave functions the total numbers of supporting points for the two - body ( @xmath5 ) and the spectator ( @xmath6 ) momenta are 34 and 20 , respectively . as we shall see in the next section",
    ", this could lead to a problem of integration with almost two billions grid points .",
    "therefore , it is obviously very important to limit the number of participating partial waves or to truncate the elementary amplitude in order to simplify the formalism as well as to avoid the unnecessarily long cpu - time required to calculate the reaction cross section . at @xmath7 gev",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the hypertriton photoproduction the use of four lowest partial waves ( @xmath8 , see table  [ probability_wf ] for the explanation of @xmath9 ) would nicely approximate the full calculation , whereas the use of @xmath10 would lead to a perfect result .",
    "it has been also pointed out that careful inspections in a wide range of kinematics should be performed , before we can apply this approximation in the hypertriton photo- and electroproduction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been also known that the hypernucleus production cross section is sensitive to the elementary amplitude , especially at the forward directions , where the two recent experimental data sets from saphir @xcite and clas @xcite collaborations show a lack of mutual consistency @xcite . as a consequence , hypertriton production at this kinematics",
    "could also shed light on the solution of this discrepancy problem .",
    "however , the extraction of the information on the elementary amplitude from the nuclear cross sections requires a massive fitting process , which would become impossible if the cpu - times required to calculate these cross sections were extremely long .    the present analysis is greatly motivated by these facts .",
    "here we shall quantitatively investigate the effects of omitting the higher partial waves of nuclear wave functions on the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "we shall also compare this result with the result of the approximation made by excluding the relativistic terms in the elementary amplitude as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . to this end",
    "we take the electroproduction process , since photoproduction is only a special case of electroproduction .",
    "our motivation is obvious , namely to find the shortest cpu - time for which the deviation of the calculated cross section from the full calculation is still controllable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : formalism ] we shall briefly review our formalism and state our problem . we shall present and discuss the results of our calculations in section [ sec : result ] . section [ sec : compare_data ] will focus on the comparison of our results with experimental data . in section [ sec : conclusion ]",

    "finally , the largest deviation , almost 1 nb / sr at the top of the highest cross section peak , is obtained if we use only @xmath61-waves . since the largest differential cross section is around 5 nb / sr , it is obvious that the latter provides a relatively poor approximation method for the hypertriton electroproduction .",
    "figure  [ fig : relativ ] demonstrates the effects of excluding the relativistic terms on the calculated differential cross section .",
    "since it has just been shown that the use of @xmath10 can approximate the full calculation with an accuracy up to 3% , we believe that it is sufficient to limit the use of partial waves up to @xmath10 at this stage .    the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : relativ ] demonstrates the effect of the ss - terms exclusion .",
    "we note that the maximum deviation is only about 4% at @xmath65 gev .",
    "therefore , the ss - terms can be safely neglected for this process .",
    "the shape of the differential cross section obtained by excluding the sb - terms is found to be completely different . as a consequence ,",
    "the deviation from the full calculation is quite large ( see also table  [ tab : cpu_time ] ) .",
    "the extreme nonrelativistic approximation ( @xmath48 only ) also yields a large deviation from the full calculation .",
    "the reason that the deviation in the latter is relatively smaller than in the former is that this approximation yields very small cross section .",
    "although the analysis of ref .  @xcite has been performed at the elementary level and using a quite different elementary operator , our result corroborates its finding , i.e. , both the exclusion of the sb - terms and the extreme nonrelativistic approach can not be used as a good approximation in the hypertriton electroproduction .",
    "furthermore since the exclusion of the sb - terms was not investigated by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , our analysis therefore provides an extension of their finding .    at this stage , it is also important to consider the cpu - times required to make the plots just shown .",
    "along with the corresponding deviations from the full calculation , the required cpu - times to calculate the 961 points of the cross section by using a single processor pentium-4 pc are listed in table  [ tab : cpu_time ] .",
    "it is interesting to see that the cpu - time is significantly reduced by a factor of 30 if we limit the partial waves up to @xmath64 , while the accuracy is still maintained up to about @xmath66 nb / sr . as a consequence , to obtain the plot shown at the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : relativ ] we need less than 9 hours .",

    "( [ nro1 ] ) does not significantly reduce the cpu - times .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in the first line of table  [ tab : cpu_time ] , where the cpu - time for the calculation with @xmath10 decreases from 511  min ( full terms ) to 485  min ( only @xmath48 ) .",
    "this result proves that computing the rest 19 @xmath71 amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ nro1 ] ) is much simpler , and therefore much faster , than computing the massive integrals given in eq .",
    "( [ trans2 ] ) with the complete partial waves . at the same time",
    "the maximum deviation in the latter becomes almost 5 nb / sr .",
    "this is because in the electromagnetic production of kaon the high energy of the process enhances the role of all but the kroll - ruderman term [ see eq .",
    "( [ nro1 ] ) ] , and the extreme nonrelativistic approach results in a very small cross section .",
    "consequently , the largest difference with the full calculation is about 5 nb / sr , i.e. , the largest differential cross section found with the full calculation .",
    "note that the decrease of @xmath70 from 0.15 nb / sr ( full terms ) to 0.10 nb / sr ( using only @xmath72 ) seems to be fortuitous , because the average deviations for the two cases are the same ( 0.02 nb / sr ) .    to complete our analysis",
    "we have also investigated the effects of the higher partial waves and the relativistic terms at @xmath74 gev@xmath75 . however , since the obtained cross sections are quite small ( 0.32 nb / sr , at most ) , it is very hard to draw a quantitative conclusion at this kinematics .",
    "although our primary motivation is to quantitatively study the effects of excluding higher partial waves and relativistic terms , it is also imperative to compare the results with the available experimental data given in ref .",
    "the comparison is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] . unfortunately , due to their large error bars , the present experimental data still allow for the @xmath61-wave approximation and the use of only bb terms in the elementary amplitude . in the latter ,",
    "it is obvious that experimental data at forward angles with about 10% error bars would be able to justify the important role of the sb terms @xmath76 . in the former",
    ", we note that the largest deviation of using only @xmath61-waves does not appear at @xmath77 gev .",
    "instead , at the forward directions the largest deviation ( approximately 0.99 @xmath78b / sr , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pwaves ] ) is found with @xmath79 gev .",
    "therefore , experimental data with the same quality , but at @xmath79 gev , would be very useful to check the validity of the @xmath61-waves approximation .",
    "for the sake of numerical accuracy and efficient cpu - time we would , however , recommend the use of partial waves with @xmath8 along with a full elementary amplitude .",
    "the discrepancy between the calculated cross sections and the experimental data point at @xmath80 requires a special explanation . at this kinematics",
    "we note that the calculated cross sections are much smaller than those at the forward direction .",
    "this behavior seems to be almost independent of the total c.m .",
    "however , we have also found that the longitudinal part of the cross section ( @xmath81 ) dominates other parts [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ds_domega_virtual ] ) ] in the whole kinematics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pwaves ] and falls off quickly as a function of the @xmath82 . on the other hand , the angular distribution of the transverse cross section ( @xmath83 ) tends to be more flat than the longitudinal one . as a consequence",
    ", we may conclude that such behavior should originate from the elementary amplitude and not from the effect of the nuclear wave functions .",
    "thus , if we believed that this experimental data point were correct , then we had to reconsider the improvement of the elementary operator .",
    "as stated in the introduction , this means that the extraction of the elementary information from the hypertriton production cross section would be mandatory in the future works .",
    "otherwise , new measurements at this kinematics are urgently required .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the effects of higher partial waves and relativistic terms on the accuracy of the calculated differential cross sections of the hypertriton electroproduction .",
    "we have shown that an accurate calculation , with a maximum deviation of less than 4% , could still be obtained if we used the three lowest partial waves with isospin zero ( i.e. , using @xmath8 , since the selection rule excludes the @xmath84 component ) . in this case , the cpu - time for calculating differential cross sections is reduced by a factor of about 60 .",
    "the exclusion of certain elementary amplitudes @xmath71 has a tiny impact on the cpu - time , but a big impact on the accuracy of the calculation . in view of this , for future consideration we suggest the use of partial waves with @xmath8 with a full elementary amplitudes @xmath71 .",
    "comparison of the results with the available experimental data supports our finding .",
