    "seyfert galaxies are classified as radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and further divided into two subtypes , seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 , according to their different optical line widths .",
    "base on the orientation - based unification model @xcite , seyfert 2 galaxies are considered to be the same objects as seyfert 1 galaxies but viewed from a different direction .",
    "the detection of polarized broad permitted emission lines in several seyfert 2 galaxies further supported this unification model @xcite .",
    "however , previous studies showed that only about 40% - 45% of seyfert 2 galaxies have polarized hidden broad line regions ( hblr ) @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetric studies of seyfert 2 galaxies showed that the hblr seyfert 2 galaxies have higher luminosities of [ ] , optical , radio and mid infrared than the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "besides , for several observational properties , such as @xmath3/@xmath4 , @xmath5/@xmath4 , and @xmath6}$ ] , the hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are found to be similar to seyfert 1 galaxies , and the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are noted to be more like hii / starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is unclear why some but not all seyfert 2 galaxies have detectable hblrs .",
    "several possibilities have been proposed : ( 1 ) from the ratios of @xmath5/@xmath4 , @xcite suggested that the detectability of the hblr in seyfert 2 galaxies is related to the inclination of the torus .",
    "( 2 ) some evolutionary processes might be at work between the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) @xcite found that the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) have similar distribution of black hole masses , accretion rates and the ratios of @xmath5/@xmath4 .",
    "they thus concluded that the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are the counterparts of the nls1s at edge - on orientation .",
    "( 4 ) the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies could be mainly powered by nuclear starbursts rather than accretion onto the central black hole @xcite .",
    "( 5 ) from x - ray data , @xcite indicated that the nuclear activity and obscuration might play an important role in the visibility of polarized broad lines .",
    "( 6 ) @xcite showed that the broad line regions might disappear at low luminosities in advection - dominated accretion models .",
    "( 7 ) @xcite suggested that some seyfert 2 galaxies could intrinsically lack broad line regions .",
    "( 8) some seyfert 2 galaxies might be deficient in scattering material .",
    "emission lines have long been used to distinguish the origin of active galaxies .",
    "for example , optical emission lines of seyfert 2 galaxies , such as [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] , are usually more stronger than those of hii / starburst galaxies relative to the recombination lines . for seyfert galaxies , photoionization from a power - law continuum , presumedly from the central agn , is proposed to be responsible for the ionization mechanisms and is generally successful in reproducing observed optical lines @xcite .",
    "if the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies were powered by nuclear starburst activities , one important question is how the narrow line regions ( nlrs ) of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are ionized .",
    "however , we note that @xcite have showed that most of line ratios of the seyfert 2 galaxies could be reproduced by starburst models . besides , a photoionization model with power - law continuum might fail to reproduce all observed properties in some cases . for example , observations of [ ] suggested that the electron temperature could be up to @xmath722,000 k @xcite while the photoionization model could only give a lower one ( @xmath711,000 k ) . therefore , some other physical processes , such as shock - heating and starburst , might also play a significant role even in a photoionization dominated model @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that we need to consider different ionization mechanisms when we investigate the origin of the ionization for seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "in this paper , we investigate and compare possible ionization mechanisms of the nlrs for the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies by considering photoionization , shock - wave heating , and starburst models .",
    "we calculate line ratios of the photoionization model with the cloudy program of version 08.00 , last described by @xcite .",
    "the shock models are obtained from the library calculated by @xcite with the mapping iii code , and the starburst models are obtained from @xcite .",
    "active galaxies , such as starburst and seyfert 2 , show narrow emission lines in their spectra .",
    "the line ratio [ ] @xmath05007/h@xmath2 @xmath8 3 was found to be a good criterion to separate seyfert 2 and starburst or -like galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , some starburst galaxies were also found to have [ ] @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "other line ratios , such as [ ]  @xmath06583/h@xmath1 , [ ]  @xmath06300/h@xmath1 and [ ]  @xmath0@xmath06716 ,  6731/h@xmath1 , are also needed to separate the starburst and seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite . in figure  1",
    ", we show the diagnostic diagram of these line ratios ; the data of the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are collected from literatures and listed in table  1 .",
    "the data of -like galaxies and liners are adopted from @xcite .    beside the well - known separation between the starburst and seyfert 2 galaxies",
    ", we note that the distribution of the non - hblr seyfert 2 is very different from that of the hblr ones .",
    "the difference is mainly caused by the different line ratio of [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath1 . both kolmogorov - smirnov test ( @xmath10 ) and student s t - test ( @xmath11 )",
    "show that the [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath1 distribution of the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are significantly different .",
    "this indicates that the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies have different physical conditions . in order to understand the physical properties of these seyfert 2 galaxies ,",
    "we compare the observed data with different ionization mechanisms in the following .",
    "seyfert galaxies are usually considered to be photoionized by central agns .",
    "the ionization source is suggested to be a power - law continuum @xcite . in order to compare with the observed data , we use the cloudy program to produce the line ratios .",
    "the cloudy package is designed to simulate photoionization of clouds with different incident continuum .",
    "we assume that the incident ionizing continuum is a power law with an index @xmath12 and the distance from the cloud to the central continuum is set to be 100 pc .",
    "the derived ionization parameter @xmath13 varies from 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 and the hydrogen density @xmath16 varies from 10@xmath17 to 10@xmath18  @xmath19 .",
    "figure  2 shows the results of cloudy models with different nitrogen abundances .",
    "figure  2a shows that the relative emission between [ ] and [ ] is not very sensitive to the nitrogen abundance as expected .",
    "figure  2b indicates that the high [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath1 ratio of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies can be reproduced by increasing the nitrogen abundance to five times solar abundance ( 5n@xmath20 ) .",
    "we note that if we simply increase all metal abundance , the [ ] emission would also increase as well and would not reproduce the observed [ ] / [ ] ratio .",
    "this result suggests that the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies might have higher n / o relative abundance than the hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "however , as shown in figure  2c , the [ ] emission can not be reproduced with both ( n@xmath20 ) and 5n@xmath20 abundance .",
    "to investigate the origin of the [ ] emission , we compare the emission of [ ] with that of [ ] in figure  3 .",
    "there is a significant correlation between [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath1 and [ ] @xmath0@xmath06716 , 6731/h@xmath1 for both hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies as shown in figure  3 .",
    "this indicates that the emission of both [ ] and [ ] must have the same origin .",
    "we also note that the correlations might have different slopes for both kinds of galaxies ; the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies seems to have a slightly steeper slope than that of the hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the photoionization model is difficult to explain the high [ ] .",
    "this suggests that some other mechanisms might be operative for producing the observed [ ] and [ ] emission .",
    "one other possible excitation mechanism for the nlrs of seyfert 2 galaxies is shock - wave heating .",
    "@xcite has presented a library of radiative shock models calculated using the mappings iii code .",
    "the parameters in the library have broad ranges with the pre - shock density @xmath21 from 0.01 to 1000  @xmath19 , the shock velocity @xmath22 from 100 to 1000 km  s@xmath23 , the pre - shock magnetic fields @xmath24 from 10@xmath25 to 10@xmath26  g , and the magnetic parameter @xmath24/@xmath21@xmath27 from 10@xmath26 to 100  @xmath28 g  @xmath29 .",
    "the library of mappings iii code is available in the internet .",
    "we compare the observed line ratios with the results from the library .",
    "the shock model with the standard solar abundance can reproduce the distribution of the [ ] and [ ] emission .",
    "on the other hand , the [ ] emission of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies can be reproduced only by increasing metal content to two times solar abundance in the shock models .",
    "this result further suggests that the nitrogen abundance of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are higher than that of the hblr ones .",
    "however , it is noted that the shock models can not produce enough [ ] emission . by adding ionized pre - shock gas in the shock models @xcite might be able to produce high enough [ ] emission but would fail to produce the observed [ ] emission .",
    "these results show that shock models are unable to reproduce these observed line ratios simultaneously .",
    "another possible ionization mechanism is starburst .",
    "a large library of starburst models has been presented by @xcite . however , as shown in figure  1 , only three sources lie on the extreme starburst region .",
    "it is obvious that the [ ] and [ ] line emission of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies can not be reproduced by the starburst models .",
    "furthermore , if the [ ] emission is from starburst region , high [ ] emission would be expected .",
    "however , the averaged [ ] / [ ] ratio is @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite , indicating the contribution from star formation is similar for the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies . besides , @xcite indicated that the contribution from supernovae to the starburst models is @xmath32  20% and can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the starburst models would hardly explain these line ratios even including supernova contribution .",
    "based on these results , all the line ratios can not be reproduced by one single model .",
    "this might not be unreasonable since nlrs could be composed of clouds with different ionization conditions .",
    "for example , the [ ] emission could come from highly ionized regions that powered by agns while [ ] emission come from lower ionized regions .",
    "one possibility to explain the observed line ratios is a composite model of an agn continuum and starburst and/or shock .",
    "however , the [ ] /h@xmath1 line ratios produced by these three single models with solar abundance are all much less than observations , so any combination of these three models can not produce enough [ ] emission for the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "this result suggests that the high [ ] /h@xmath1 ratios must be due to over abundance of nitrogen in the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "it is not unusual for seyfert 2 galaxies to show enhanced nitrogen abundance .",
    "previous studies showed that the nitrogen abundance of seyfert 2 galaxies can reach to 3.55 solar abundance @xcite .",
    "our results further show that the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies have higher nitrogen abundance than the hblr seyfert 2 galaxies . comparing these results",
    ", we suggest that the high nitrogen abundance of the seyfert 2 galaxies in early studies might be mainly caused by the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the difference between the hblr and non - hblr might be caused by their stellar evolution .",
    "based on evolutionary models of starburst activities , @xcite showed that the n / o relative abundance reaches a maximum value at about 3 @xmath33 10@xmath34 years .",
    "the nitrogen could be dredged up from red supergiants in the post - main - sequence stage , and this would result in the nitrogen overabundance .",
    "therefore , the super - solar nitrogen abundance of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies may imply that the starburst activities in the non - hblr seyfer 2 galaxies are in the post - main - sequence stage .",
    "the high abundance of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies implies that there could be an evolutionary connection between the non - hblr and hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "agns have been suggested to be related to circumnuclear star formation .",
    "accreted gas is transported to the central regions to fuel the agns ; the transported gas accumulates around the nucleus and might also trigger star formation .",
    "the super - solar abundance suggests that the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are in older stages of stellar evolution than the hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "this would also imply that the gas around the nucleus of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies might have diminished , which would cause low accretion rates for the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the results found by @xcite , which showed that the accretion rates of non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies are lower than those of hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "when the accretion rate is below some thresholds , the broad line regions could disappear @xcite ; therefore , no polarized broad lines are observed in the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "we investigate the ionization mechanisms of the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies by comparing the photoionization , shock , and starburst results with observations . a possible explanation for all observed emission might require combination of different models ;",
    "for example , the [ ] emission could come from highly ionized regions that powered by agns while [ ] emission come from lower ionized regions by starburst or shock waves .",
    "however , our results show that the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies must have higher n / o relative abundance than the hblr seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the high n / o relative abundance could originate from stellar evolution and imply an evolutionary connection between the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies . as a hblr seyfert 2",
    "galaxy evolves , the gas around the nucleus become diminished , resulting in low accretion rates and depleting the broad line regions ; this evolution might transfer hblr seyfert 2 galaxies to non - hblr ones .",

    "we are also grateful to the groups and persons who provide the cloudy code and the mappings iii library .",

    "<S> we investigate the ionization mechanisms for hidden broad - line region ( hblr ) and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies by comparing some optical emission line ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath1 ratio of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies is significantly higher than that of the hblr seyfert 2 galaxies while other line ratios , such as [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] /h@xmath1 are similar . </S>",
    "<S> to probe the origin of this difference , we explore theoretical results of different ionization models , such as photoionization , starburst , and shock models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that none of these models can explain the high [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath1 ratio of the non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies with solar abundance ; the high [ ] @xmath06583/h@xmath1 must be reproduced from enhanced nitrogen abundance . since nitrogen overabundance can be achieved from the dredge - up of red supergiants in the post - main - sequence stage , we suggest that the observed nitrogen overabundance of the non - hblr seyfert 2 might be caused by stellar evolution , and there could be an evolutionary connection between the hblr and non - hblr seyfert 2 galaxies . </S>"
