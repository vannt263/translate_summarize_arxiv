    "signal reconstruction is usually formulated as a linear inverse problem @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the true signal , @xmath3 is an @xmath4 real matrix , @xmath5 is the observed data and @xmath6 represents the random noise . over the last decade",
    ", sparse reconstruction has received great attentions @xcite . in general ,",
    "the task of sparse reconstruction is to find a sparse @xmath7 from .",
    "obviously , the most natural measure of sparsity is the @xmath0-norm , defined at @xmath2 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the cardinality of the set @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the support of @xmath7 , that is @xmath12 .",
    "when the noise level of @xmath13 is known , we consider the following constrained @xmath0 regularization problem @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16-norm , and @xmath17 is the noise level . specially , in the noiseless case , i.e. , when @xmath18 , problem reduces to seeking for the sparsest solutions from a linear system as follows @xmath19    finding a global minimizer of problem is known to be combinational and np - hard in general @xcite as it involves the @xmath0-norm . the number of papers dealing with the @xmath0-norm is large and several types of numerical algorithms have been adopted to approximately solve the problem . in this paper , we mainly focus on the penalty methods . before making a further discussion on the penalty methods , we briefly review other two types of approaches , greedy pursuit methods and relaxation of the @xmath0-norm .",
    "greedy pursuit methods , such as orthogonal matching pursuit @xcite and cosamp @xcite , adaptively update the support of @xmath7 by exploiting the residual and then solve a least - square problem on the support in each iteration .",
    "this type of algorithms are widely used in practice due to their relatively fast computational speed . however , only under very strict conditions , can they be shown theoretically to produce desired numerical solutions to problem .",
    "relaxation methods first replace the @xmath0-norm by other continuous cost functions , including convex functions @xcite and nonconvex functions @xcite , such as the bridge functions @xmath20 with @xmath21 @xcite , capped-@xmath22 functions @xcite , minmax concave functions @xcite and so on .",
    "then the majorization - minimization strategy is applied to the relaxation problem , which leads to solving a constrained reweighted @xmath22 or @xmath16 subproblems @xcite in each step .",
    "the cost functions of the iterates are shown to be descent @xcite , while the convergence of the iterates themselves are generally unknown .",
    "the penalty method is a classical and important approach for constrained optimization . for an overview on the penalty method",
    ", we refer the readers to the book @xcite .",
    "an extensively used penalty method for problem is to solve the following least square penalty problem @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a penalty parameter . as problem",
    "still involve the @xmath0-norm , the greedy pursuit and relaxation methods mentioned before are applicable for approximately solving the problem .",
    "however , it has relatively better structure than problem from the standpoint of algorithmic design .",
    "more precisely , the proximal operator of @xmath0-norm has a closed form , while the least square penalty term in problem is differentiable with a lipschitz continuous gradient .",
    "therefore , it can be directly and efficiently solved by proximal - gradient type algorithms @xcite or primal - dual active set methods @xcite .",
    "one specific proximal - gradient type algorithm for problem is the iterative hard thresholding ( iht ) @xcite .",
    "in general , it is shown in @xcite that for arbitrary initial point , the iterates generated by the algorithm converge to a local minimizer of problem . under certain conditions",
    ", the iht converges with an asymptotic linear rate .",
    "the structure of the least square penalty problem makes it easier to develop convergent numerical algorithms .    the penalty parameter @xmath25 balances the magnitude of the residual and the sparsity of solutions to problem .",
    "an important issue is that wether problem and share a common global minimizer for some penalty parameter @xmath25 .",
    "it seems intuitive that there exists certain connections between these two problems .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there is very little theoretical results on penalty methods for problem in general .",
    "recently , chen , lu and pong study the penalty methods for a class of constrained non - lipschitz optimization @xcite .",
    "the non - lipschitz cost functions considered in @xcite does not contain the @xmath0-norm and the corresponding results can not be generalized to the constrained @xmath0 regularization problems .",
    "nikolova in @xcite gives a detailed mathematical description of optimal solutions to problem and further in @xcite establishes their connections with optimal solutions to the following optimization problem @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a given positive integer .",
    "problem also involves the @xmath0-norm and is usually called the sparsity constrained minimization problem .",
    "however , optimal solutions of problem and their connections with problem have not been studied in these works .",
    "this paper is devoted to describing global minimizers of a class of constrained @xmath0 regularization problems and the corresponding penalty methods . as in @xcite",
    ", we use `` optimal solutions '' for global minimizers and `` optimal solution set '' for the set of all global minimizers in the remaining part of this paper .",
    "the class of constrained @xmath0 regularization problems we considered has the following form @xmath28 where @xmath29 or @xmath30 . obviously , problem has two cases , the @xmath16 constrained problem and the @xmath22 constrained problem as follows @xmath31 the analysis of these two constrained problems and their penalty methods share many common points and thus we shall discuss them in a unified way .",

    "[ hypo:1 ] the function @xmath34 is continuous , nondecreasing with @xmath35 .",

    ". we shall give a comprehensive study on connections between optimal solutions of problem and problem .",
    "our main contributions are summarized below .",

    "we clarify the relationship between optimal solutions of problem and those of problem .",
    "we find that , when @xmath44 problem probably * never * has a common optimal solution with problem for any @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the penalty problem may fail to be an exact penalty formulation of problem .",
    "a numerical example is presented to illustrate this fact in section [ sec : exp ] .",
    "* we show that under a mild condition on the penalty function @xmath45 , problem has exactly the same optimal solution set as that of problem once @xmath46 for some @xmath47 . in particular , for @xmath37 we present a penalty function @xmath45 with which the penalty term in problem is differentiable with a lipschitz continuous gradient .",

    "this section is devoted to the existence of optimal solutions to problems and .",
    "the former issue is trivial , while the latter issue requires careful analysis . after a brief discussion on the existence of optimal solutions to problem",
    ", we shall focus on a constructive proof of the existence of optimal solutions to problem .",
    "since the objective function of problem is proper , lower semi - continuous and has finite values , it is clear that problem has optimal solutions as long as the feasible region is nonempty .",
    "we present the result in the following theorem . for simplicity , we denote by @xmath48 the feasible region of problem , that is @xmath49    [ thm : existconst ] the optimal solution set of problem is nonempty if and only if @xmath50 , where @xmath48 is defined by .    in the rest of this section , we dedicate to discussing the existence of optimal solutions to problem .",
