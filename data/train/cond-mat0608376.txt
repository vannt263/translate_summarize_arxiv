    "the vast majority of quantum hall states observed experimentally in the lowest landau level ( lll ) are very accurately described in terms of composite fermion@xcite ( or equivalently the hierarchy@xcite ) wavefunctions . despite these successes ,",
    "there are a number of quantum hall states that remain much less well understood and may require more exotic explanations .",
    "for example , there exist a few experimentally observed quantum hall plateaus in the lll that do not fit into the usual hierarchy - composite - fermion framework@xcite .",
    "also , in the first excited landau level ( 1ll ) , even the  simple \" observed filling fractions ( such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) appear from numerics to have strong differences from the corresponding states in the lll@xcite .",
    "of the non - hierarchy exotic states that have been proposed , perhaps the best understood is the moore - read pfaffian@xcite , which is thought to describe@xcite the plateau observed at @xmath5 , and whose quasiparticle excitations have exotic nonabelian statistics . however , for the neighboring experimentally observed plateau@xcite at @xmath6 there are at least two competing trial states which have been proposed : the hierarchy ( composite fermion ) state @xcite , and the ( particle - hole conjugate of the ) @xmath7 read - rezayi parafermion state@xcite a generalization of the pfaffian which has an even richer nonabelian structure .",
    "another case where more exotic states may occur is in the quantum hall effect of rotating bosons@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will study another type of generalization of the pfaffian that gives a different trial state at @xmath0 ( or @xmath8 ) for spinless electrons .",
    "we call this new wavefunction the  gaffnian \" , for reasons described below . the hamiltonian that generates this state as its unique highest density zero energy state is an extremely simple generalization of the hamiltonian that similarly generates the moore - read pfaffian ( and is also similar in spirit to the hamiltonians that generate the read - rezayi wavefunctions ) .",
    "similar to the pfaffian and read - rezayi states , when additional flux is added , there is a degeneracy of states associated with zero - modes of the quasiholes . in the present case",
    "the zero - modes have semionic statistics , compared to fermionic statistics in the pfaffian case , or parafermionic statistics in the read - rezayi case .",
    "we then write this wavefunction as the correlator of a conformal field theory , known as the virasoro @xmath9 minimal model . since this field theory is nonunitary",
    "we conclude that the wavefunction does not represent a phase , but rather a quantum critical point between phases . as such",
    ", the concept of nonabelian statistics is not necessarily applicable .",
    "nonetheless , exact diagonalizations show extremely high overlaps with this trial wavefunction .",
    "we take this to suggest that this wavefunction is likely relevant to a phase transition that is somehow  near \" the hierarchy phase .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : gaffnian ]",
    "we will introduce this new wavefunction and explore some of its properties .",
    "we define this state as the unique highest density zero energy state of a simple hamiltonian .",
    "we then consider what happens when additional flux is added to the system . as mentioned above , in the presence of quasiholes , there is a ground state degeneracy stemming from semionic zero - modes .",
    "since some of the analytic manipulations are messy , we relegate some of the details to rather lengthy appendices . in particular , the demonstration that the gaffnian is a unique ground state of this hamiltonian , and the explicit counting of quasihole states is put in appendix [ app : counting ] .",
    "however , for the interested reader , this appendix shows explicitly the mechanism by which the semions occur . in section [ sec : conformal ] we construct the gaffnian as a correlator of the @xmath9 virasoro minimal model conformal field theory . in section",
    "[ sec : exact ] we examine results of exact diagonalizations .",
    "we look at low energy excitations to find evidence of criticality , and we also discover that the overlap of the gaffnian with the hierarchy wavefunction is remarkably high ( we also find high overlap with exact diagonalizations of systems with interactions close to coulomb )",
    ". finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] we give a brief discussion of some of our results .",
    "before constructing our new trial wavefunction , for motivation we review construction of laughlin wavefunctions . constrained to a single landau level ( lll or 1ll ) , the relative angular momentum of two fermions @xmath10 must be odd and positive .",
    "thus the minimum relative angular momentum is @xmath11 ( for bosons , @xmath12 and @xmath10 must be even ) .",
    "we define a projection operator @xmath13 to project out ( i.e , to keep only ) states where any two particles have relative angular momentum less than @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 even ) .",
    "this projection operator@xcite can serve as a hamiltonian .",
    "the laughlin @xmath16 state is the unique highest density ( zero energy ) ground state of @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 odd for fermions and even for bosons ) .",
    "we now generalize this construction . in a single landau level the relative angular momentum of _",
    "three _ fermions @xmath19 has a minimum value @xmath20 ( for bosons , @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is not hard to show@xcite that @xmath22 is dictated by symmetry , but any other @xmath23 is allowed .",
    "we analogously define a projection operator @xmath24 to project out ( i.e. , to keep only ) states where any three particles have relative angular momentum less than @xmath25 which will serve as our hamiltonian .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the pfaffian ( at @xmath26 for fermions and @xmath27 for bosons ) is the unique highest density ( zero energy ) ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath28 . in ref .",

    "knowing that a unique quantum hall ground state exists for the hamiltonian @xmath42 , we set about describing the properties of the gaffnian .",
    "we begin by writing down the wavefunction explicitly .",
    "we will represent a particle s coordinate as an analytic variable @xmath43 which is simply the complex representation of the particle position @xmath44 . on the spherical geometry",

    "the degree of the polynomial @xmath52 ranges from @xmath53 to @xmath54 giving a complete basis of the @xmath55 states of the lll .",
    "we will not write the measure explicitly , instead writing all wavefunctions simply as analytic functions ( which must be fully symmetric for bosons and fully antisymmetric for fermions ) .",
    "it is convenient to think , for a moment about bosons at @xmath1 . since the hamiltonian @xmath42 puts no restriction on the two particle angular momentum ,",
    "there is no restriction against two bosons being at the same point @xmath56 .",
    "however , when a third particle approaches , it must approach the other two@xcite such that the overall angular momentum of the three particles is @xmath57 , i.e. , the wavefunction vanishes as @xmath58 .",
    "( in this sense , the gaffnian , like the pfaffian and haffnian , is a paired state in the spirit of that originally proposed in ref . . )",

    "we have assumed the number @xmath62 of particles is even and @xmath63 means symmetrize or antisymmetrize over all particle coordinates for bosons or fermions respectively .",
    "one can confirm directly that the above wavefunction for @xmath60 correctly has the property that it does not vanish as two particles come to the same position but vanishes as three powers as the third particle arrives .",
    "further , we show in appendix [ app : counting ] that this is the unique densest wavefunction that has this property .",
    "as is standard in spherical geometry@xcite we can obtain the value of the flux by looking at the maximum power of @xmath64 that occurs .",
    "counting powers of @xmath45 we find that the gaffnian wavefunction occurs on the sphere for total flux @xmath65 this value of flux is the same as that for the standard hierarchy @xmath0 state@xcite .",
    "this should not be a surprise , since some of the first trial wavefunctions for @xmath0 ( for fermions ) in the hierarchy were based on pairing@xcite .",
    "in the appendix we analytically establish that this state is the unique zero energy state of the hamiltonian @xmath42 at this flux .",
    "we have numerically confirmed this fact by explicitly diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath42 with up to @xmath66 particles on the spherical geometry and up to @xmath67 particles on the torus .",
