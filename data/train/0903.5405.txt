    "in the interior of a single rotating , electrically charged , axisymmetric and stationary black hole in electrovacuum ( described by the kerr - newman family of solutions ) there exists a cauchy horizon @xmath5 , which is the future boundary of the domain of dependence of the event horizon @xmath6 .",
    "the presence of this cauchy horizon is related to the fact that , in boyer - lindquist coordinates , the axisymmetric and stationary einstein - maxwell vacuum equations are hyperbolic within an interior vicinity of @xmath6 .",
    "the two horizons @xmath6 and @xmath5 represent the past and future boundary of this hyperbolic region .",
    "interestingly , for the kerr - newman family the areas @xmath7 of the horizons @xmath8 are related by @xmath9 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are angular momentum and charge of the black hole , respectively .    in pure einsteinian gravity ( i.e. , without maxwell field ) ,",
    "these observations have been generalized in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for axisymmetric and stationary black holes _ with surrounding matter _",
    "there always exists a regular inner cauchy horizon , provided that @xmath10 holds .",
    "it was also shown that such black holes satisfy relation   ( with @xmath11 ) in general .    in this letter , we investigate axisymmetric and stationary black holes with surrounding matter and include electromagnetic fields . for our analysis , we will make use of a linear matrix problem , whose integrability conditions are equivalent to the einstein - maxwell equations in vacuum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of such a linear problem ( lp ) permits the application of so - called soliton methods ( e.g.  the `` inverse scattering method '' ) through which particular solutions of the field equations in question can be found ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "here we integrate the lp along the boundaries of the hyperbolic region inside the black hole and obtain in this manner useful relations between the field quantities at these boundaries .",
    "in particular , we are able to calculate the metric and electromagnetic potentials on @xmath5 in terms of those on @xmath12 . moreover",
    ", we find that from these relations eq .   can be deduced ; i.e. , eq . turns out to be valid for arbitrary axisymmetric and stationary black holes with surrounding matter in einstein - maxwell theory .",
