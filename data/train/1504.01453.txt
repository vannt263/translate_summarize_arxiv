    "[ dust_sed ] , the infrared sed is first fitted with the model of @xcite as detailed in @xcite , based on which the total cold gas ( hi+h@xmath2 ) within the iram beam is measured by multiplying the dust mass with the gas - to - dust ratio derived from the diffuse regions of the galaxy . as discussed in @xcite , the derived total cold gas mass is not sensitive to the absolute dust mass but to the ratio of dust masses of star - forming and diffuse regions . as a result ,",
    "as long as diffuse and star - forming regions have similar dust grains , different dust models gives a similar estimate of cold gas masses within the iram beam . to derive the gas mass of star - forming regions ,",
    "we do assume star - forming regions have the same gas - to - dust ratio as the diffuse regions , which is true for spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , this assumption may break down in dwarfs as their star formation history is stochastic in both space and time so that both diffuse and star - forming regions are affected by different physical processes that impact the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "for example , the sn shocks may continuously destroy the dust in the diffuse regions in the past yet meanwhile dust grains in dense clouds are protected from such destruction but instead grow further .",
    "nevertheless , such a hypothesis needs systematic investigations before any conclusion can be made .    after subtracting the atomic gas mass from the derived total gas mass ,",
    "the molecular gas mass is shown to be about 10@xmath20 m@xmath21 as listed in table 1 .",

    "[ alpha_co ] , we compared our measurement to those in the literature @xcite whose molecular gas masses are derived in the same way as ours except for the galaxy wolf - lundmark - melotte ( wlm , * ? ? ?",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio used to derive the @xmath0 of wlm is based on the relationship between @xmath23 and metallicity @xcite , which shows a large scatter ( @xmath24 10 ) around the metallicity of wlm .",
    "the metallicity measurement of sextans a was not taken exactly at the co pointing .",
    "but as no metallicity gradient is seen in sextans a @xcite , we did not expect large offsets ( @xmath24 0.1 dex ) from the value quoted here .",
    "our @xmath1 is much larger than those at higher metallicities .",
    "the overall trend of @xmath1 with metallicity is very steep , with a power law index between 2.5 and 3 .",
    "this implies that co emission is very weak in extremely metal poor galaxies .",
    "while our works offer very interesting constraints on the @xmath1 at extreme low metallicity , the result is solely based on one region of @xmath7 20 arcsec compared to the entire galaxy of five arcmin . only about 10% of the total molecular gas of sextans a @xcite is within the beam .",
    "large scatters of @xmath1 may be expected with future detections of co emission over different regions of the galaxy .",
    "the relative strength of the co brightness can also be compared to other quantities of sextans a measured within the iram beam as listed in table 1 . by integrating the ir sed of the iram region , the 8 - 1000 @xmath9 m infrared luminosity of dust within the beam",
    "is measured to be 1.7@xmath1610@xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "so the co luminosity in k km s@xmath8 pc@xmath18 relative to the infrared luminosity in @xmath26 is about 1:45 , which is slightly larger than spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is partly caused by the rarity of both dust and co in extremely metal poor galaxies while different excitation mechanisms for co and dust must also play some roles .",
    "if comparing to the star formation rate ( sfr ) as measured from the far - uv luminosity @xcite , the sfr per co luminosity is about ten times higher than star - forming non - merger massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "if scaling by the stellar mass as measured from spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath9 m measurements @xcite , the co luminosity per stellar mass of sextans a within the iram beam is on average 10 times lower than non - merger massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "the detection of co @xmath3 1 - 0 emission in sextans a , if it is real , offers a crucial evidence for the existence of molecular gas in such a low metallicity environment , confirming the result inferred from the dust measurement @xcite .",
    "although warm h@xmath2 has been revealed by infrared spectroscopic observations in several extremely metal poor galaxies @xcite , co emission , unlike warm h@xmath2 that traces shocked regions , is known as tracers of ism where stars form in massive metal rich galaxies .",
    "the detection of co in sextans a is a first step toward determining whether co can serve a similar role in extremely metal poor galaxies .",
    "co is one of few efficient coolants of molecular gas in galaxies . in extremely metal poor galaxies , due to the photo - dissociation , the co can only survive in a tiny core of molecular gas clouds , while h@xmath2 can be self - shielded and exist in thick envelopes surrounding the co molecular core . thus cooling through co in extremely metal poor galaxies may be not as effective as in metal rich galaxies . if the co molecular cores in metal poor galaxies follow the same relationship between the viral masses and co luminosities of giant molecular clouds in milky way and nearby galaxies @xcite , the viral mass of the co molecule core for the observed co luminosity is estimated to be about 3@xmath1610@xmath19 m@xmath21 .",
    "this is only a tiny fraction of dust - based total molecular gas mass , as small as 0.3% .",
    "then the measured co within the iram beam is associated with only a small fraction of the total molecular gas within the same beam , and it can not effectively cool the bulk of the molecular gas in sextans a. as a result of the photo - dissociation of co , atomic or ionized carbon may become abundant .",
    "studies did show that [ cii ] 158 @xmath9 m is much brighter relative to co in dwarfs as compared to in spirals @xcite . with spatially resolved studies of ic 10 , @xcite showed that the h@xmath2 column density associated with ionized carbon can be five times the observed hi density in order to interpret the cooling as implied by the [ cii ] luminosity , and the associated h@xmath2 mass may be 100 times the mass of h@xmath2 associated with co. however , unlike co , [ cii ] with its high excitation temperature ( 97 k ) still could not cool the gas to the low temperature at which gas may contract to the high density for stars to form .    fig .",
    "[ alpha_co ] further shows the comparison between the measured extreme large @xmath0 of sextans a with models predictions .",
    "the empirical relationship ( yellow solid line , * ? ? ? * ) based on galaxies above 20%@xmath27 predicts that @xmath0 @xmath28 @xmath29 , giving a value several times larger than our observed one at 7%@xmath27 . based on the principle that the co abundance is primarily regulated by photo - dissociation and",
    "the h@xmath2 is self - shielded , theoretical models of @xcite and @xcite predict that @xmath1 is a strong function of the visual extinction for individual clouds .",
    "if assuming the visual extinction is proportional to the metallicity , @xmath0 then increases rapidly with the decreasing metallicity in both models , predicting values larger than the observed for sextans a as shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha_co ] .",
    "the model of @xcite also employed photo - dissociation region models but for the integrated galaxies instead of individual clouds , and found on average a flat trend of @xmath0 as a function of metallicity , producing a value much smaller than the observed one at 7%@xmath27 . unlike the above models , the model of @xcite employs small scale magneto - hydrodynamic simulations combined with large - scale simulations of gas distributions to predict @xmath0 as a function of metallicities . for physical scales of our iram beam size ( sub - kpc ) , a shallow trend as indicated by the purple line in fig .",
    "[ alpha_co ] is predicted , with predicted values significantly smaller than the observation .    as a summary ,",
    "current models predict a large range of @xmath30 at the metallicity of sextans a , some significantly larger than the observed one while some much smaller than the observation .",
    "it is still difficult to judge which model is better or worse just based on one data point , which is also because many assumptions are invoked in theoretical models in order to produce the trend of @xmath1 as a function of metallicity .",
    "a large range of model s predictions reflects the limited knowledge about co formation and destruction , as well as properties of gas clouds over different spatial scales at the extreme low metallicity .",
    "if @xmath0 is truly large as seen in this study , co may be not an efficient coolant in metal poor galaxies , and its application as a tracer of the molecular gas mass may be inappropriate in the early universe .",
    "we reported a marginal detection of co @xmath3=1 - 0 emission by targeting the brightest far - ir peak in an extremely metal poor galaxy , sextans a. the signal is about 10 km / s offset from the hi peak within the same beam .",
    "the @xmath0 is further derived by comparing the estimated co flux to the h@xmath2 mass as inferred from the dust map . in spite of a marginal signal ,",
    "the observation is deep enough to play a strong limit on the @xmath0 that is about seven hundred times the milky way value .",
    "this suggests that co emission is exceedingly weak in extremely metal poor galaxies , challenging its role as a gas coolant in these galaxies .",
