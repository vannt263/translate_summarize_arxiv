    "as the ibm blow - out involves a distinct ergodicity of the magnetic field , an increased magnetic transport of density and heat may be expected . in order to compare the magnetic transport ( superscript @xmath223 ) with the @xmath82 advective transport ( superscript @xmath224 ) ,",
    "the ion density transport @xmath225 and the electron heat transport @xmath226 are analysed .",
    "the motivation for considering @xmath225 instead of @xmath227 is that the bulk of mass is transported by the ions . on the other hand",
    ", the higher mobility of the electrons implies that @xmath228 , so that only @xmath226 is of interest .",
    "[ fig : pldgdw ] shows the volume averaged transport quantities @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 for both closed - flux - surface region and sol . the ion density transport shown in ( a ) and ( b ) is clearly dominated by @xmath82 advection .",
    "the ratio between magnetic transport and @xmath82 transport is less than @xmath233 , and the only relevant magnetic contributions are restricted to the time interval @xmath234 around and shortly after the peak ibm mode phase .",
    "in contrast , the electron heat transport shown in ( c ) and ( d ) exhibits a significant magnetic component . in the closed - flux - surface region after the peak ibm mode phase for times @xmath235 , the ratio between average magnetic and advective electron heat transport is between the values @xmath236 .",
    "the magnetic transport in the sol is by approximately one order of magnitude smaller than in the closed - flux - surface region so that the ratio @xmath237 has values around @xmath238 in the sol .    in the case of a saturated l - mode - state based on plasma parameters which reflect post - elm conditions ( reduced plasma beta and drift parameter , increased electron collisionality )",
    ", the magnetic transport of electron heat is , on average , by two orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath82 advective transport .",
    "likewise , the magnetic density transport is by three orders of magnitude smaller then the @xmath82 transport .",
    "thus , the only regime where the magnetic transport substantially contributes to the total transport , is the peak ibm mode phase and the following transition to a turbulent state at times @xmath239 .    the time - dependent total elm energy loss , quantified by the loss fraction of the equilibrium pedestal energy @xmath240 , is shown in fig .  [ fig : plwped ] .",
    "at @xmath241 , which can be considered as the end of the elm crash , the energy loss amounts to about 42% . at that time , the average pedestal density of both electrons and ions has dropped by 41% with respect to the initial equilibrium state .",
    "the electron temperature at @xmath241 has decreased by half and the ion temperature by a third . as the advective transport of electron and ion heat is nearly equal in magnitude , the larger decrease of the electron temperature compared to the ion temperature",
    "can be ascribed to the additional magnetic transport which is negligibly small for the ions .",
    "the magnetic field structure associated with edge localised ideal ballooning mode ( ibm ) bursts was investigated computationally using the nonlinear gyrofluid electromagnetic model gemr .",
    "the simulation setup was geared to exemplary asdex upgrade h - mode conditions .",
    "both the ibm induced changes in the magnetic equilibrium and the magnetic flutter due to local plasma fluctuations were investigated .",
    "the formation of magnetic islands and ergodic magnetic field regions was visualized by poincar sections . in order to discuss the level of magnetic ergodicity associated with the ibm blow - out and the subsequent turbulent aftermath ,",
    "the average radial displacement of a magnetic field line was evaluated .",
    "the level of ergodicity was investigated for several saturated turbulent states in which the electron dynamical beta , the electron collisionality , the drift scale and the magnitude of the source flux were varied .",
    "furthermore , the mean radial field line displacement was evaluated for parameter - consistent , saturated l - mode - like states .",
    "finally , the volume averaged magnetic transport of ion density and electron heat was compared to the corresponding @xmath82 transport and the total elm energy loss was discussed .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the ibm induced changes in the safety factor profile amount up to 1% of the initially prescribed value @xmath161 ( @xmath242 ) . due to the spatial variation of the safety factor profile ( short - scale transitions from negative to positive deviations ) and the additional local shear piece resulting from the shafranov shift , the corresponding changes in the magnetic shear amount up to 100% of the initially prescribed value @xmath243 ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "the time - dependent toroidal mode number spectra of both perpendicular magnetic flutter components reflect the evolution of the initially dominant @xmath145 mode .",
    "the different spatial variation of the magnetic flutter components is due to the structure in the pressure fluctuations and the related current fluctuations .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic flutter increases until the ibm instability nonlinearly saturates ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "3 .   the linear growth of the ibm instability involves the formation of small scale magnetic islands in the closed - flux - surface region ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "the laminar structure of the magnetic surfaces in the closed - flux - surface region is not significantly perturbed .",
    "the formation of resonant magnetic islands in the sol can be ascribed to the use of a local @xmath185 model , which implies that the electromagnetic response in the sol during the linear growth phase is highly overestimated .",
    "ergodic magnetic field regions form near the end of the linear phase when the ibm instability starts to perturb the equilibrium profiles .",
    "the level of magnetic ergodicity ( measured by the average radial field line displacement ) increases until the ibm instability saturates .",
    "the turbulent aftermath of the burst results in an enduring ergodicity across the simulation domain",
    ". 6 .   even in a saturated turbulent l - mode - like post - elm state",
    "the magnetic field remains ergodized .",
    "however , the level of ergodicity decreases if the plasma parameters are adjusted to the reduced post - elm profiles .",
    "the ibm induced magnetic transport of ion density can be neglected in comparison to the corresponding @xmath82 transport . by contrast , the magnetic transport of electron heat can amount up to 80% of the corresponding @xmath82 transport .",
    "the magnetic transport of electron heat is significant during the blow - out phase and the subsequent transition to a turbulent state . in a saturated l - mode - like post elm state",
    "the magnetic contribution to the electron heat transport is negligibly small .",
    "the total pedestal energy loss of the ibm burst amounts to about 40% of the equilibrium pedestal energy .",
    "considering these points we can conclude that the ideal ballooning elm scenario involves an enduring ergodisation of the entire edge region .",
    "moreover , the l - mode like post - elm state is also characterized by a non vanishing degree of magnetic ergodicity .    for correct interpretation of the results we have to discuss several limitations of the present local ( `` @xmath185 '' ) turbulence model .",
    "the code gemr evolves the profiles as part of the dependent variables but the derivation of the model equations is based on local parameters .",
    "the discrepancy between radially varying profiles and inconsistent local plasma parameters increases with the distance from the flux surface for which the plasma parameters were defined .",
    "this implies that especially in the sol the deviation from the consistent plasma parameters is large .    for the simulations presented in this work",
    "this means that the plasma beta is unrealistically high when considering the range around the separatrix and the sol .",
    "hence , the electromagnetic response and , in particular , the magnetic flutter are overestimated in the sol . especially during the linear growth phase of the ibm instability , where the profiles in the sol are close to zero",
    ", the plasma beta in the sol is highly overestimated as self - consistent values would be close to zero .",
    "the formation of resonant magnetic islands and ergodic field regions in the sol during the linear growth phase can be ascribed to this model inconsistency .",
    "the discrepancy between profiles and plasma parameters also concerns the transition from the peak ibm blow - out phase resulting from h - mode - like plasma parameters to an l - mode - like turbulent post - elm state which is characterized by a decreased plasma beta .",
    "we have shown that the mean radial field line displacement decreases up to one order of magnitude if the nominal simulation parameters are changed to describe a saturated l - mode - like post - elm state .",
    "our results that the magnetic heat transport during the elm crash and the subsequent turbulent state is always smaller than the heat transport by @xmath82 advection seems to disagree with the fact that the magnetic field is ergodized at all times during and after the elm blow - out .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be solved by comparing the radial @xmath82 velocity with the radial velocity associated with the motion of an electron along a perturbed magnetic field line .",
    "considering the mean radial field line displacement after one toroidal turn and assuming an electron moving with thermal velocity , we find that the average radial velocity associated with the magnetic flutter during and after the peak blow - out phase is about one order of magnitude smaller than the radial @xmath82 velocity .",
    "hence , the magnetic fraction of the electron heat transport can be small although the magnetic field is ergodised .",
    "the point is that the magnetic flutter and the resulting ergodicity is continuously changing with time such that an electron within one simulation time step sees only a fraction of the magnetic snapshot visualized in a poincar plot .",
    "thus , an ergodic region in a poincar plot is not necessarily indicative of a dominant magnetic transport .",
    "the elm induced ergodicity of the magnetic field was earlier investigated by mhd simulations @xcite . while mhd models more readily allow for the implementation of a realistic x - point - geometry , the present gyrofluid simulations ( including turbulent scales ) are based on a simplified circular geometry .",
    "still , the present results regarding the elm induced formation of an ergodic edge region as well as the associated magnetic transport are in qualitative agreement with mhd results . in the present gemr modelling",
    "the major novel results concern the small - scale dominated turbulent aftermath immediately following the ibm burst .",
