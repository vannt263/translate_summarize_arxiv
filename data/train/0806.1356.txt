    "at very high energies , multi - particle production in qcd is generated by low @xmath0 partons in the nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "these partons have properties best described as a color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "when two sheets of cgc collide in a high energy heavy ion collision , these partons are released and create energy densities an order of magnitude above the energy density required for the crossover from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this matter , at early times after a heavy ion collision , is a coherent classical field , which expands , decays into nearly on shell partons and may eventually thermalize to form a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . because it is formed by melting the frozen cgc degees of freedom , and because it is the non - equilibrium matter preceding the qgp , this matter is called the glasma  @xcite .",
    "the glasma is of intrinsic interest because heavy ion collisions create chromo - electric and magnetic fields in bulk , that in absolute magnitude , are some of the strongest such fields in nature ; they are greater ( by several orders of magnitude ) than the magnetic fields on the surface of magnetars .",
    "the glasma is also important for quantifying the initial conditions for the qgp . in particular , two measures of qgp formation",
    ", the flow of bulk matter and the energy loss of jets , can be significantly influenced by the properties of the glasma . in the former case ,",
    "the initial matter distribution and non - equilibrium flow are important for a quantitative determination of the properties of the  perfect \" fluid qcd . in case of the latter",
    ", jets can experience significant energy loss in their interactions with the glasma .",
    "there is a strong analogy between the physics of the little bang in a heavy ion collision and the big bang that created our universe . in the big bang",
    ", the inflaton field with large occupation number @xmath1 decays rapidly with the expansion of the universe .",
    "likewise , in the little bang , the glasma field with occupation number @xmath1 decays rapidly after the collision . in the big bang ,",
    "low momentum quantum fluctuations are explosively amplified in a process known as pre - heating  @xcite . in the little bang",
    ", the explosive amplification of low momentum quantum fluctuations may be related to a weibel  @xcite or a nielsen - olesen  @xcite type instability .",
    "the interaction of quantum fluctuations with the decaying inflaton field can lead to rapid  turbulent \" thermalization  @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon may be responsible for rapid thermalization in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "there is also likely a concrete analogy between super horizon fluctuations observed in the cobe and wmap measurements and the near side ridge measured at rhic  @xcite .",
    "another strong analogy is between sphaleron driven topological transitions that may induce @xmath2 and @xmath3 odd metastable states in heavy ion collisions  @xcite and the matter  anti - matter asymmetry generated by @xmath4 and @xmath3 violating topological transitions during electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "what both long range rapidity correlations and topological transitions in strong fields have in common is the likelihood that they both survive the later stage interactions that thermalize the system causing it to lose memory of how it was formed .    in this talk ,",
    "i will first briefly describe our understanding of the properties of hadron and nuclear wavefunctions at high energies in the cgc framework .",
    "i will next describe the quantum field theory framework of particle production in strong time dependent fields .",
    "multi - particle production in the glasma can be computed systematically in this framework .",
    "an important part of this systematic computation is a proof of high energy factorization .",
    "i will describe briefly how plasma instabilities arise and are accounted for in this framework .",
    "finally , i will discuss how glasma flux tubes form the near side ridge seen in heavy ion collisions .",
    "at high energies , the competition between qcd bremsstrahlung which enhances the parton density)and screening / recombination processes which depletes it leads to a saturation of parton densities when the field strengths squared become maximal : @xmath5 .",
    "this non - linear strong field regime of qcd is characterized by a saturation scale  @xcite @xmath6 ; modes in the nuclear wavefunction with momenta @xmath7 have high occupation numbers typical of classical fields . in the cgc",

    "bk equations are derived in the leading logarithmic approximation in @xmath0 , where running coupling effects are neglected .",
    "there is currently an intense on - going theoretical effort to compute next - to - leading order corrections to the kernels of the leading order rg equations  @xcite .",
    "phenomenological  dipole \" models that incorporate the physics of saturation have been very successful - see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review of comparisons of these models to the hera , fixed target e+a , d+a and a+a rhic data .",
    "a detailed dipole model study  @xcite shows that the saturation scale @xmath15 .",

    "when two cgc sheets collide in an a+a collision , the static color sources in the nuclear wavefunctions become time dependent .",
    "an _ ab initio _ computation of the glasma therefore requires a formalism to compute particle production in quantum field theories coupled to external time dependent sources  @xcite .",
    "multi - particle production in the glasma is always non  perturbative ; the relevant question is whether the physics is one of strong coupling or weak coupling as will be considered here ",

    "it can be expressed as @xmath24 the gauge fields on the right hand side can be computed numerically for proper times @xmath25  @xcite by solving the classical yang - mills ( cym ) equations in the presence of the light cone current @xmath26 corresponding to the local color charge densities of the two nuclei with initial conditions determined by matching the ( known ) solutions to the cym equations in the backward light cone .",
    "the energy densities of produced gluons can be computed in terms of @xmath17 and one obtains @xmath27 ",
    "gev/@xmath29 for the previously mentioned values of @xmath17 obtained by extrapolating from fits to the hera and fixed target e+a data .",
    "this lo formalism was applied to successfully predict the rhic multiplicity at @xmath30  @xcite as well as the rapidity and centrality distribution of the multiplicities  @xcite .",
    "cgc model comparisons to the rhic data on limiting fragmentation  @xcite or solutions of cym equations  @xcite , extrapolated to the lhc , give @xmath31  @xmath32 charged particles . at lo , the initial transverse energy is @xmath33 , which is about 3 times larger than the final measured @xmath34 , while ( assuming parton hadron duality ) @xmath35 .",
    "the two conditions are consistent if one assumes nearly isentropic flow which reduces @xmath34 due to @xmath36 work while conserving entropy .",
    "this assumption has been implemented directly in hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite .",
    "cgc based models give values for the initial eccentricity @xmath37 that are large than those in glauber models  @xcite because the energy and number density locally is sensitive to the lower of the two saturation scales ( or local participant density ) in the former and the average of the two in the latter . naively , cgc initial conditions would have more flow then and have more room for dissipative effects relative to glauber .",
    "this conclusion is turned on its head in a simple parametrization of incompletely thermalized flow  @xcite : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the knudsen number , @xmath40 the cross - section , @xmath41 the sound speed and @xmath42 the transverse overlap area .",
    "@xmath43 is a number of order unity .",
    "if thermalization were complete , @xmath44 and one approaches the hydro bound .",
    "computing @xmath37 with different initial conditions , and plotting the l.h.s ratio versus @xmath45 , one has a two parameter fit to @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the greater cgc eccentricity forces @xmath46 to be lower for more central collisions thereby leading to lower @xmath41 ; quicker saturation of @xmath46 forces larger @xmath40 and therefore lower @xmath47 in the cgc relative to glauber  @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable however that this result may not prove robust against more detailed modeling .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the results are very sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "how much flow is generated in the glasma before thermalization ?",
    "the primordial glasma has occupation numbers @xmath48 and can be described as a classical field .",
    "as the glasma expands , higher momentum modes increasingly become particle like and eventually the modes have occupation numbers @xmath49 , which may be described by a thermal spectrum . a first computation of elliptic flow of the glasma found only about half the observed elliptic flow  @xcite",
    "albeit the computation did not properly treat the interaction between hard and soft modes in the glasma . formulating a kinetic theory that describes this evolution is a challenging problem in heavy ion collisions  for a preliminary discussion ,",
    "see  @xcite .    the lo glasma result , from the solutions of yang ",
    "mills equations , has very interesting properties .",
    "firstly , the solution is boost invariant in the strong sense  the fields are independent of the space - time rapidity ; the dynamics of the produced gluon fields is purely transverse as a function of proper time .",
    "another interesting feature is that the chromo @xmath50 and @xmath51 fields are purely longitudinal after the collision  @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that one can generate topological chern ",
    "simons charge in heavy ion collisions  @xcite . because the range of color correlations in the transverse plane is of order @xmath52 , the lo picture that emerges is of color flux tubes with finite topological charge , stretching between the valence color degrees of freedom .",
    "as we shall see , this picture provides a plausible explanation of the near side ridge .    .",

    "such distributions can trigger an instability analogous to the weibel instability in qed plasmas  @xcite .",
    "romatschke and i showed ( in 3 + 1-d numerical solutions of cym equations )  @xcite that small rapidity dependent quantum fluctuations in the initial conditions generate transverse @xmath50 and @xmath51 fields that grow rapidly as @xmath55 .",
    "they are the same size as the rapidly diluting longitudinal @xmath50 and @xmath51 fields on time scales of order @xmath56 .",
    "the transverse @xmath50 and @xmath51 fields may cause large angle deflections of colored particles leading to @xmath57 broadening and energy loss of jets ",
    "numerical simulations by the frankfurt group appear to confirm this picture  @xcite .",
    "these interactions of colored high momentum particle like modes with the soft coherent classical field modes may also generate a small  anomalous viscosity \" whose effects on transport in the glasma may mask a larger kinetic viscosity  @xcite .",
    "the same underlying physics may cause  turbulent isotropization \" by rapidly transferring momentum from soft  infrared \" longitudinal modes to ultraviolet modes  @xcite .",
    "finally , albeit the lo result demonstrated that one could have non - trivial chern - simons charge in heavy ion collisions , the boost invariance of cym equations disallows sphaleron transitions that permit large changes in the chern - simons number  @xcite . with rapidity dependent quantum fluctuations",
    ", sphaleron transitions can go .",
    "these may have important consequences  in particular @xmath2 and @xmath3 odd metastable transitions that cause a novel  chiral magnetic effect \"  @xcite in heavy ion collisions .",
    "numerical cym results for chern - simons charge and ( square root ) exponential growth of instabilities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo ] .",
    "the discussion at the end of the last section strongly suggests that next - to - leading order ( nlo ) quantum fluctuations in the glasma , while ( superficially ) parametrically suppressed , may alter our understanding of heavy ion collisions in a fundamental way . to cosmologists",
    ", this will not come as a surprise  quantum fluctuations play a central role there as well . in recent papers , it was shown for a scalar theory that moments of the multiplicity distribution at nlo in a+a collisions could be computed as an initial value problem with retarded boundary conditions ; this framework has now been extended to qcd  @xcite . in qcd ,",
    "the problem is subtle because some quantum fluctuations occur in the nuclear wavefunctions and are responsible for how the wavefunctions evolve with energy ; others contribute to particle production at nlo .",
    "[ fig : fact ] illustrates particle production in fields theories with strong sources and the non - factorizable quantum fluctuations that are suppressed in the leading log framework .",

    "the @xmath63 s are analogous to the parton distribution functions in collinear factorization ; determined non - perturbatively at some initial scale @xmath64 , their evolution with @xmath65 is given by the jimwlk hamiltonian .",
    "this factorization theorem is a necessary first step before a full nlo computation of gluon production in the glasma .",
    "( [ eq : fact - formula ] ) includes only the nlo terms that are enhanced by a large logarithm of @xmath66 , while the complete nlo calculation would also include non enhanced terms .",
    "these would be of the same order in @xmath53 as the production of quark - antiquark pairs @xcite from the classical field . to be really useful",
