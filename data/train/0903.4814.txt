    "the cluster ( @xmath2 3ma , @xmath3 385pc ) is routinely investigated for deriving basic properties associated to the star formation process : initial mass function , frequency of disks , or incidence of x - ray emission ( caballero 2008b ; walter et  al .",
    "in particular , the x - ray emission from early- and late - type cluster stars have been investigated by a number of authors ( wolk et  al .",

    "however , the x - ray variability in the cluster , which informs on the frequency of flares , strength of magnetic fields , evolution of angular momenta , variations in the radiative wind shocks , or presence of a low - mass companion , has been mostly studied in relatively short time scales , of up to 24h ( with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ ; references above ) .",
    "only berghfer & schmitt ( 1994 ) and groote & schmitt ( 2004 ) have carried out mid - term x - ray variability studies in @xmath0  orionis ( about 75ks distributed over more than 30 days ) , but just of the two brightest stars : @xmath0  ori  af  b ( o9.5v + b0.0v + b0.5v ) and @xmath0  ori  e ( b2vp + ? ) . here",
    "we revisit _ rntgensatellit _ ( _ rosat _ ) data to search for x - ray variability of @xmath0  orionis stars in time scales of days .",
    "_ rosat _ ( jun 1990feb 1999 ) was a joint german , us , and uk space telescope designed for measurement of soft x - rays in the energy range of 0.12.4kev , corresponding to wavelengths of about 1206 .",
    "one of its focal plane instruments was the _",
    "rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) , which provided simultaneosuly relative large field of view ( 38@xmath438arcmin@xmath5 ) and good spatial resolution ( 0.499@xmath60.001arcsecpixel@xmath7 , fwhm @xmath8 2arcsec ) . however , hri had negligible energy resolution .",
    "in this work , we used the _ rosat _ source catalog of pointed observations with hri ( 1rxh ; _ rosat _ consortium 2000 ) .",
    "this catalog contains a list of sources detected by the standard analysis software system in reprocessed , public hri datasets .",
    "in addition to a set of source and sequence flags provided by the _ rosat _",
    "data centers in germany , the us , and the uk , each source in the catalog has associated basic parameters like coordinates , count rate , or signal - to - noise ratio . regrettably , although exposure time is given with an accuracy of 1s , dates of observation start and finish ( labels begdate and enddate ) are provided in `` y : m : d '' mode ( date expressed as year , month number , day in month ; e.g. `` 1995 - 02 - 26 '' ) . as a result ,",
    "the 1rxh time resolution is of _ one  day_. since we were interested in a qualitative estimation of variability in scales of days , having a larger precision was unnecessary .",
    "we loaded all the x - ray 1rxh events at less than 30arcmin to @xmath0  ori  af  b with the aladin sky atlas ( bonnarel et  al .",
    "2000 ; caballero 2009 ) . for an easier visualization , we overimposed the 1976 detected events onto a digitized image ( fig .",
    "[ fig.hri ] ) .    in the 1rxh catalog ,",
    "there are some single events at angular separations larger than 30arcmin to @xmath9  ori  af  b , but they are embedded in the nearby and molecular clouds .",
    "the area investigated by us is , however , nearly free of absorption .",

    "( 2008 ) derived @xmath10 = 0.19@xmath60.02mag by comparing the observed @xmath11 color of a number of stars with the expected @xmath12 for each star s spectral type .",
    "besides , in the light of some studies of the spatial distribution and kinematics in the cluster , stars at more than 30arcmin to the @xmath0  orionis center have low probabilities to belong to the cluster ( jeffries et  al .",
    "2006 ; caballero 2007a ,  2008a ) .",
    "hri observations were carried out during two intervals spaced almost three years .",
    "the temporal distribution of the observations is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.crmjd ] . the main run consisted of one _ rosat _ visit per day during 34 days from 1995  feb  26 to 1995  mar  31 ( pi : j.  h.  m.  m. schmitt ) .",
    "the other run consisted of a single observation on 1992  sep  13 . except for the 1995  mar  15 observation , which lasted for only 0.22ks , individual `` exposure live times '' during the main run varied in the aprroximate time interval 1.03.6ks , with mean and standard deviation exptime = 2.2@xmath60.7ks .",
    "however , the 1992  sep  13 observation was longer and lasted for more than 4h ( exptime @xmath13 14.6ks ) .",
    "we complemented the temporal information above with that provided by the _",
    "mission web page at the max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik ( mpe ) .",
    "the time spanning between start and end of daily observations were in general larger than exptime .",
    "for example , total pointing time in 1995  feb  26 was 2.707ks , but the hri detector was switched off in three occasions for a summed time interval of 0.342ks , thus giving exptime = 2.365ks .",
    "however , only in a few cases total pointing time was significantly ( by a factor at least two ) larger than exptime .",
    "all pointing coordinates were identical .",
    "since the _ post facto _ attitude determination accuracy of _ rosat _ was 6arcsec , the overlapping field of view between different pointings was maximal ( i.e. the full 38arcmin - size square centered on @xmath0  ori  af ",
    "b ) . therefore ,",
    "all sources were observed ( or at least pointed at ) in each of the observations .",
    "besides , the processing site of all images was the mpe , which ensures the homogeneity of the dataset .",
    "we identified 24 groups of 1rxh events , each of them having more than 20 associated 1rxh events , @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 20 ) . due to the clear radial concentration of events ( see below ) and small size ( @xmath16 10arcsec ) of each group in comparison to their mutual separation ( @xmath17 40arcsec ) , we found no problem to associate a group of 1rxh events to every single x - ray source .",
    "for an accurate follow - up analysis , we only selected x - ray sources with more than 20 events . two discarded _ rosat _ x - ray sources with lower number of events are linked to the @xmath0  orionis stars ( [ w96 ]  47711038 ; @xmath14 = 15 ) and ( [ w96 ]  47711075 ; @xmath14 = 15 ) .",
    "remaining discarded x - ray sources have 11 or less associated 1rxh events .    then , we searched with aladin for the optical and near - infrared counterparts of the x - ray sources with @xmath15 20 .",
    "the basic properties of the 24 identified x - ray sources and their corresponding optical / near - infrared counterparts are given in tables  [ table.xrayparameters ] and  [ table.opticalcounterparts ] .",
    "all except one counterpart are @xmath0  orionis cluster members in the mayrit catalog ( caballero 2008b ) .",

    "likewise , there may be several events associated to a bright x - ray source for each daily observation ( @xmath31 4.8d@xmath7 for the brightest ones ) .    on the other hand , in table  [ table.opticalcounterparts ] we provide the recommended alternative names , two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) coordinates and @xmath32-band magnitudes , and remarks from the literature for the optical / near - infrared counterparts of the x - ray sources in table  [ table.xrayparameters ] .",
