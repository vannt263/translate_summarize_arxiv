    "the vector meson production in the nuclear and particle reactions has opened up various avenues providing ample opportunities for learning many interesting topics in physics .",
    "the leptoproduction of vector meson is a potential tool to investigate the hadron structure of photon @xcite .",
    "the dilepton production in the intermediate energy region is undoubtly understood due to the decay and the interference of the vector mesons @xcite .",
    "since the vector meson strongly couples to the nucleon and its resonances @xcite , the dynamics of these resonances can be explored by studying the vector meson production process .",
    "in fact , there are predictions of many nucleonic resonances ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and references their in ) , which are yet to be found .",
    "the vector meson production could be an useful probe to search these missing resonances .",
    "it should be added that the sub - threshold production of the vector meson can probe the low lying resonances , like @xmath3 @xcite .    in the recent years",
    ", the production of vector meson in the nuclear reaction has drawn considerable attention to explore its properties in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is a fundamental issue in the nuclear physics . in this context , the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution spectrum was measured , in the recent past , by the cbelsa / taps collaboration at the electron stretcher accelerator ( elsa ) in bonn @xcite to look for the medium modification on the omega meson in the nb nucleus .",
    "they had also taken data for the above spectrum due to @xmath4 reaction . here , we present the reaction mechanism for the @xmath5 reaction on the proton target in the gev region . in this energy region ,",
    "the @xmath0 in the final state ( according to the particle data group @xcite ) can arise due to the decay of the low lying vector mesons , such as @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we consider this reaction proceeds through three steps : ( i ) the formation of vector mesons , ( ii ) the propagation of these vector mesons , and ( iii ) the decay of these mesons into @xmath0 channel . symbolically , this reaction goes as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 stands for the above mentioned vector mesons @xmath9 .",
    "the qualitative comparison ( presented below ) amongst the @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 mesons contributions to the above reaction shows that the @xmath1 meson contributes dominantly to this reaction . the data on the @xmath4 reaction show that the production cross section for the @xmath10 meson is the largest compared to those for the other two vector mesons in the energy region considered here .",
    "for example , the measured cross section at 1.5 gev beam energy , as reported by various group , are @xmath12b @xcite , @xmath13b @xcite , and @xmath14b @xcite .",
    "therefore , the measured @xmath15 is about 3.53 times larger than the measured @xmath16 , and the former is about 135.29 times larger than the measured @xmath17 .",
    "the vector meson propagator @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath8 stands for @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 mesons as mentioned above .",
    "for these mesons , we have values for their resonance masses and total widths @xcite : @xmath20 mev , @xmath21 mev ; @xmath22 mev , @xmath23 mev ; @xmath24 mev , @xmath25 mev . the data taken at elsa @xcite show the peak at @xmath26 mev in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution spectrum . around this mass ,",
    "the propagators for both @xmath10 and @xmath1 mesons behave as @xmath27 , where as @xmath28 goes as @xmath29 .",
    "the decay widths for @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 mesons in the @xmath0 branch ( according to the ref .",
    "@xcite ) are @xmath30 mev , @xmath31 mev , and @xmath32 mev .",
    "in fact , @xmath33 is negligibly larger than 0.12 mev and @xmath34 could be much less than 0.006 mev at @xmath35 mev .",
    "therefore , at 1.5 gev the ratios @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 show that we can safely ignore the contribution to the cross section originating from the @xmath11 meson of mass around 782 mev . for @xmath10 and @xmath1 mesons ,",
    "the above data show @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , this analysis illustrates qualitatively that the contribution to the @xmath0 emission from the @xmath1 meson decay is a factor about 521 times larger than that originating due to the @xmath10 meson decay .",
    "similar analysis shows this factor is about @xmath42 at @xmath43 equal to 1.2 gev .",
    "there were two aspects in the experiment ( done at elsa @xcite ) to be mentioned .",
    "one aspect in this measurement was the gamma beam of wide energy spread ( @xmath44 gev ) , since it was the tagged photon produced by the bremsstrahlung radiation of the 2.8 gev electron on the pb target .",
    "this is unlike to the conventional experiments where the beam energy is used to be taken almost monoenergetic .",
    "in fact , the measured @xmath0 invariant mass distribution spectrum has been reported for definite @xmath1 meson momentum bin instead of a particular incident energy .",
    "the another aspect of this experimental set - up was the large width in the detecting system ( 55 mev ) , which is about 6.5 times larger than the width of the @xmath1 meson ( i.e. , @xmath45 mev in the free state ) produced in the @xmath4 reaction .",
    "therefore , the measured @xmath0 invariant mass distribution spectrum showing its width about 55 mev can be believed undoubtly due to the width of the detector resolution . to compare the calculated results with the data , we incorporate these two aspects in our formalism presented in sec .  2 .",
    "the results of this study are discussed in sec .  3 , and we give the conclusion in sec .  4 in this manuscript",
    "the formalism for the @xmath0 emission in the @xmath4 reaction , as mentioned above , consists of the production , propagation , and the decay of the omega meson produced in the intermediate state , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "the primes on @xmath47 and @xmath48 are used at present to distinguish them from the initial state particles , which have been dropped afterward for convenience .",
    "the t - matrix @xmath49 for this process can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the propagator for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "@xmath52 in this equation is the matrix element for @xmath53 due to intrinsic coordinates .",
