    "quasi - particle model ( qqgp ) of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) was first proposed by peshier _ et .",
    "@xcite to explain the non - ideal equation of state ( eos ) , observed in lattice gauge theory simulations ( lgt ) @xcite . at finite temperature , instead of real quarks and gluons _ with _ qcd ( quantumchromodynamics ) _ interactions _ we may as well consider the system to be made up of _ non - interacting _ quasi - particles with thermal masses , quasi - quarks and quasi - gluons , and study the thermodynamics .",
    "quasi - particles are quanta of plasma collective modes excited by quarks and gluons through qcd interactions .",
    "initial quasi - particle model was found to be thermodynamically inconsistent @xcite and also not able to fit the more recent lgt results @xcite .",
    "gorenstein and yang reformulated the statistical mechanics ( sm ) to solve the inconsistency , but end up with an extra undetermined , temperature dependent terms in the expressions for pressure and energy density , which need to be phenomenologically chosen .",
    "however , as we discuss here @xcite , above reformulation of sm is not needed and standard sm may be applied to qqgp without any extra phenomenological terms .",
    "there is no td inconsistency in our new qqgp model .",
    "peshier s model with reformulated sm by gorenstein and yang has been studied by various groups @xcite with different expressions for thermal masses , effective degrees of freedom , so on .",
    "note that all of above works are based on the reformulation of sm of gorenstein and yang , which in fact based on mathematical identities involving derivatives with respect to temperature and chemical potentials , used to redefine average energy density ( @xmath0 ) and number density ( @xmath1 ) respectively .",
    "as we have shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , we may skip this td inconsistency problem and instead use the original definition of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and making use of td relations we may get all td quantities . as a specific example , here we discuss ( 2 + 1)-flavor qgp , studied by fodor _ et .",
    "_ @xcite using lgt .",
    "of course , there are other models like htl ( hard thermal loop ) @xcite , recent fmr ( fundamental modular region ) gas @xcite etc . based on qcd perturbative and non - perturbative calculations , but fails to fit lgt results near to the transition temperature @xmath2 . at the same time phenomenological models of qgp , based on plasma theory with qcd inputs like scqgp ( strongly coupled quark gluon plasma ) @xcite , our present qqgp model seems to fit remarkably well the lgt results with minimum number of parameters .",
    "all other qqgp models , field theoretical models @xcite , ploykov loop models @xcite also fit lgt results , but by adjusting @xmath3 or more parameters .",
    "of course , we know that near @xmath4 , region of phase transition or cross over , it is a low energy phenomena and hence qcd can not be solved by analytical methods like perturbation theory because the coupling constant @xmath5 is not small enough . probably we need to formulate phenomenological models , just like in the case of hadron spectroscopy , to study td of qgp near @xmath6 .",
    "qgp at thermodynamic equilibrium consists of interacting quarks and gluons which exhibits collective behaviour .",
    "our basic assumption is that this system may be replaced by a system of non - interacting quasi - particles with quantum numbers of quarks and gluons .",
    "these quasi - particles have additional thermal masses which are equal to plasma frequencies . here",
    "we differ from other qqgp models where , for example , the thermal mass was taken to be @xmath8 times the plasma frequency .",
    "a general expression for thermal mass or polarization tensor is very complicated expressions which is a function of momentum and frequency . only at high momentum limit",
    "it approaches a simpler form which on further approximations reduces to above form . in view of such a drastic approximation and",
    "since we use phenomenological model one may as well take @xmath9 .",
    "in fact with this relation , we get better result than with @xmath10 . further important",
    "point is that the above dispersion relation is obtained using perturbation methods with temperature dependent density distribution function appropriate to ideal system .",
    "then one formulates td of a non - ideal system . in principle , this must be carried out in a self - consistent manner as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , for example , density expression is an integral equation since @xmath11 depends on density .",
    "so we need to solve an integral equation self - consistently to get the the density . here",
    "we avoid all above complications and as a phenomenological input , we assume that @xmath12 .    following the standard procedure of statistical mechanics @xcite , the grand partition function is given by , @xmath13 where the sum is over energy states @xmath14 and particle number states @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "next on further simplifications and taking thermodynamic limit , we get , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is called q - potential and @xmath22 for bosons and fermions .",
    "@xmath23 is called fugacity .",
    "@xmath24 is the single particle energy , given by , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is momentum and @xmath27 is the total mass which contains both the rest mass and thermal mass ( @xmath28 ) of particles . @xmath28 may depend on temperature @xmath29 and chemical potential @xmath30 depending on qgp system .",
    "all other qqgp models starts from q - potential to get pressure with correction term to avoid td inconsistency and proceed to evaluate other td quantities .",
    "however , we avoid this trap of inconsistency problem by adopting a different procedure . we know that , for grand canonical ensemble , td quantities like energy density and number density may be obtained by taking ensemble averages . that is , the average energy @xmath31 is given by , @xmath32 note that the partial differentiation with respect to @xmath17 above is just a mathematical trick to express @xmath31 in terms of sum over single particle energy levels , @xmath24 , making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) .",
    "while differentiating , indirect dependence of @xmath33 in the fugacity , @xmath34 , and thermal mass , @xmath35 , must be ignored by definition . otherwise , we will not get back @xmath36 . now , on taking continum limit and after some algebra , we get , @xmath37   \\,\\ , , \\label{eq : u}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the degenarcy and equal to @xmath39 for gluons and equal to @xmath40 for quarks .",
    "@xmath41 is the number of flavors with same mass . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are modified bessel functions of order 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "let us now consider our main topic , ( 2 + 1)-flavor system , studied by fodor _ et .",
    "@xcite , using our model .",
    "it is a qgp with two light ( @xmath44 ) and one heavy ( @xmath45 ) quarks along with gluons .",
    "let us first consider the case with zero chemical potential and take @xmath46 .",
    "hence we get the energy density , expressed in terms of @xmath47 , for the quark gluon plasma of quasi - partons is @xmath48 \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath49 \\right .    \\,\\,\\ ] ] @xmath50 \\right ) \\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the stefan - boltzman gas limit of qgp , which may be obtained by taking high temperature limits of eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) for gluons and quarks separately and adding them .",
    "@xmath52 is the temperature dependent gluon mass ( @xmath28 ) , which is equal to the plasma frequency , i.e , @xmath53 . all quarks have both the thermal mass as well as the rest mass and hence , the total mass may be written as @xmath54 following the idea used in other qqgp models for the system with finite quark masses .",
    "only the difference is that our @xmath28 is equal to the plasma frequency due quarks alone .",
    "that is , @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 is the rest mass of up or strange quark .",
    "@xmath57 in thermal masses is related to the two - loop order running coupling constant , given by , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a parameter related to qcd scale parameter .",
    "this choice of @xmath60 is motivated from lattice simulations .",
    "using thermal masses with above @xmath5 , we can evaluate the @xmath61 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) .",
    "note that the only temperature dependence in @xmath61 comes from @xmath62 , which has the same form as that of lattice simulations @xcite with @xmath59 as a free parameter . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are effective number of quarks which differ from @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , because of finite masses of up and strange quarks .",
    "however , handling of finite rest masses of quarks are different in lgt studies of fodor _ et .",
    "bielefeld group @xcite .",
    "bielefeld group carried out the simulation with the ratio @xmath67 equal to constant and it is straight forward to calculate @xmath68 , where as fodor _ et .",
    "al . _ used constant @xmath56 and it is not clear how to calculate @xmath68 .",
    "hence as done in ref .",
    "@xcite we take in our calculations @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "similar normalization need to be made to fit the lgt results in other models also , either multiplying lgt data with a factor @xmath72 @xcite or model s data with @xmath73 @xcite , or sometime using massive gluon @xcite so on . from @xmath0 , we may obtain pressure @xmath74 by using a td relation @xmath75 for @xmath76 system and we get @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are pressure and temperature at some reference points .",
    "results are presented in fig . 1 along with lgt results .",
    "note that earlier this phenomenological new qqgp model with a single system dependent adjustable parameter explained very well the lgt results of bielefeld group @xcite on qgp system with massless quarks as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another td quantity which may be obtained from ensemble averaging is the number density , given by , @xmath80 and using the definition @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the volume .",
    "let us next consider ( 2 + 1)-flavor system with finite @xmath30 and lgt results are available for quark density @xmath83 or baryon density ( @xmath84 ) and difference in pressure from @xmath85 case ( @xmath86 ) . here",
    "@xmath30 is the quark chemical potential which is one third of the baryon chemical potential .",
    "the present lgt results are with @xmath87 coming from @xmath88 quarks only and hence we need to consider only @xmath88 quark density . using the expression for the number density , eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) , which on continum limit and after some algebra , reduces to @xmath89 \\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : nq}\\ ] ] now we modify earlier @xmath90 to @xmath91 as @xmath92 inspired by qcd perturbative calculations @xcite . in our case @xmath93 , mainly due to @xmath88 quarks , and @xmath57 is related to two - loop order running coupling constant , discussed earlier , but need to be modified to take account of finite @xmath30 . following the work of schneider @xcite and letessier , rafelski @xcite ,",
    "now we change @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ls ] ) as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a parameter which is equal to @xmath97 in the calculation of schneider and @xmath98 in a phenomological model of letessier and rafelski . in our model schneider s",
    "@xmath99 works well .    from @xmath83",
    ", we may obtain other thermodynamic quantities like , @xmath100 and so on .",
    "in fig . 1 , we plotted @xmath101 vs @xmath102 for ( 2 + 1)-flavor qgp with @xmath7 and compared with lgt data .",
    "we took effective number of flavors as @xmath69 , @xmath103 and @xmath71 because of finite quark masses .",
    "quark rest masses are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , values used in lgt simulations .",
    "only the parameter @xmath106 is adjusted to get the best fit to lgt data on pressure and is equal to @xmath107 . in fig .",
    "2 , the baryon density ( @xmath108 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath102 for different values of baryon chemical potentials and compared with lgt results .",
    "surprisingly good fit is obtained without any new parameters . in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath109 is plotted and again very good fit to lgt .",
    "using our new formulation of qqgp phenomenological model , we were able to explain lgt results on ( 2 + 1)-flavor qgp with just a single parameter which may be related to qcd scale parameter .",
    "our formalism is thermodynamically consistent and no need of reformulation of sm with extra temperature dependent terms in pressure and energy density so on .",
    "earlier , using this model , we explained successfully the lgt results of bielefeld group on qgp with massless quarks @xcite .",
    "hence a simple model of qqgp with a single parameter , related to qcd scale parameter , explains all existing lgt results and may explain future results in lgt and relativistic heavy ion collisions .    of course , there are many other models which all claims to fit the lgt results , but all of them involve more than one parameter .",
    "models with minimum number of parameters , which fits lgt results well , are scqgp @xcite and liquid model @xcite , both with two parameters .",
    "all other models involve more than two parameters .",
    "models based on qcd perturbative and non - perturbative calculations @xcite fails to fit the lgt results .",
    "hence , it seems , phenomenological models based on the properties of plasma with qcd inputs explains well the lgt results .",
