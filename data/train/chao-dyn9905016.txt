    "@xmath12 is an external , constant forcing , and @xmath13 is the viscosity .",
    "an important property of the goy model is that it is possible to incorporate the conservations laws of turbulence as found in the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the first conservation law that needs to be satisfied is the conservation of energy .",
    "the energy in the goy model is given by @xmath14 which should be conserved in the limits of no forcing and vanishing viscosity .",

    "we are going to focus on the limiting case @xmath24 and according to eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) @xmath25 in order to satisfy helicity conservation .",
    "the set ( [ un ] ) of @xmath5 coupled ordinary differential equations can be numerically integrated by standard techniques .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite we studied a number of features of the parisi @xcite continuum model .",
    "in particular , a `` burst '' event ( the evolution of an initial condition having support only in a finite interval of @xmath3-space ) was studied .",
    "the initial burst splits up into a right and a left moving part and on the front of each part a shock is formed .",
    "it was shown that the continuum equation without forcing or dissipation can be explicitly written in characteristic form and that the right and left moving parts can be solved exactly . when this is supplemented by the appropriate shock condition it is possible to find the asymptotic form of the burst .    in this section",
    "we shall give a brief review of some of the main features previously obtained .",
    "the continuum parisi equation is obtained from the goy model by letting the shell spacing approach zero , and expanding to the first order . by writing the distance between the shells as @xmath26 with @xmath27 ,",
    "we have @xmath28 , so with @xmath29 const.@xmath30 a continuous range of values is obtained for the variable @xmath3 .",
    "to proceed we use a taylor expansion of the type @xmath31 and similarly for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . to first order one obtains @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 etc .. by rescaling time with @xmath36 we get the parisi equation : @xmath37 for the case of no forcing or viscosity .",
    "here subscripts denote differentiation . splitting into real and imaginary parts , @xmath38 , we get @xmath39 and @xmath40 in numerical simulations we observed that a short while after the initialisation , shocks are formed in both directions . as was seen from the equations ,",
    "the real part is only able to move to the left , while the imaginary part moves both ways . setting @xmath41 in the original equations ,",
    "we get just a single real equation for the inertial range : @xmath42 for the left - moving part of the pulse , the real and the imaginary parts are seen to become proportional . inserting @xmath43 into the parisi equation gives us two possibilities : @xmath44 ( which we already treated ) and @xmath45 . for @xmath46",
    "the equation for the imaginary part becomes : @xmath47    it is possible to explain the observed splitting of the pulse by writing ( [ parisi ] ) in characteristic form .",
    "we shall not give the details , since they can be found in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "the starting point is to rewrite ( [ parisi ] ) in a form resembling the the burgers equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "of course , there are three important differences to the burgers equation : here we have an equation in @xmath51space , @xmath52 is complex and the conserved quantity is the energy @xmath53 . writing @xmath54 the riemann invariants @xmath55 can be found , and the solution can be expressed in terms of these @xmath56 and @xmath57 the formulation in terms of characteristics can now be used to understand the splitting of the pulse found in section 3.1 .",
    "the riemann invariants @xmath58 have the property that they are constant along the curve : @xmath59 the important point is that , since @xmath60 is nonnegative , one family of characteristics ( @xmath61 ) can never move to the left while the other one ( @xmath62 ) can never move to the right .",
    "if the initial condition has support in a limited region of @xmath63 , say @xmath64 $ ] the same is true of @xmath58 .",

    "@xmath65 we compute the field values by finding where , on the @xmath63-axis ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) , the characteristics going through the point @xmath67 emanate .",
    "now , if @xmath68 , the @xmath62-characteristic going through this point must emanate from some @xmath69 and thus @xmath70 .",
    "this means that either @xmath71 ( which makes the entire field vanish ) or @xmath72 which means that @xmath73 has the constant value @xmath74 , which implies that @xmath44 , in agreement with the numerical simulations .",
    "the splitting of the pulse into a right - moving part with @xmath44 and a left - moving part with @xmath75 makes it possible to give a complete solution for a single burst event . for the details",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "each pulse develops a shock which can be followed by imposing conservation of energy across the shock .",
    "the asymptotical solutions for the two pulses are : @xmath76 both decaying in time .",
    "thus a burst created on top of the zero solution not only travels down the inertial range until it is dissipated by viscosity ( here , by the continuum ) , it also travels upwards , to the smallest @xmath3 .",
    "the burst does not remain localised in @xmath3-space , but is distributed over the @xmath3-range , and then decays .",
    "it is interesting to note that the initial disturbance creates both a forward and an inverse cascade .",
    "when we study the goy model for @xmath77 we observe important deviations from the behaviour of the parisi equation described in the previous section .",
    "we focus on the motion on a single pulse in the case where both the forcing and the viscosity is zero , i.e. , @xmath78 and the two cases @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) .",
    "the initial condition is a localised bump : @xmath81 + 1 \\right\\ } \\quad \\mathrm{for } \\quad x \\in [ n_0 \\kappa_0 - \\pi , n_0 \\kappa_0 + \\pi ] ,    \\label{ini}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the center of the bump , @xmath83 is the length of the bump and @xmath84 is the height of the bump .",
    "the initial bump splits up into a left and a right moving part with the same phases as in the parisi equation .",
    "however , a shock is not formed , rather the initial bump splits into a number of individual pulses . in the case",
    "@xmath85 , the pulse to the right accelerates whereas the pulse moving to the left decelerates , similar to the shocks in the parisi equation . in the case @xmath86 , this does not happen and both _",
    "the right- and left - moving pulses propagate with a constant velocity_. in both cases , however , the shapes _ stays invariant as time progresses _ , completely similar to the behaviour of a soliton in an integrable system , like the kdv equation .    to be able to observe the pulses in more detail",
    ", we perform the limit @xmath87 in a different way as is done when the parisi equation is derived .",
    "we shall show that this leads to an interesting model containing pulses moving with constant velocity and which might even be a new example of a completely integrable discrete field theory .",
    "the starting point is the goy model @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "we now introduce the variable @xmath90 , and in terms of this variable we get @xmath91 using this substitution we get rid of the explicit dependence on @xmath92 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ equ : goyw ] ) .",
    "now we take the limit @xmath93 and at the same time we invoke _ helicity conservation _ , which means that we must choose @xmath94 . finally , we are interested in very large reynolds numbers , so we let @xmath95 and then we arrive at the model @xmath96 the middle term in the goy model has disappeared and we are left with the two terms directly responsible for the propagation of the pulses to the left and the right",
    ".    this model has turned out to have very interesting properties .",
    "an initial bump on zero background ( @xmath97 ) splits into a series of left and right moving pulses with constant velocity as already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] . similar to the case for the parisi equation ( [ equ : parisi ] ) the phases of the pulses only have certain fixed values",
    "let @xmath98 then @xmath99 and to have a solution with constant phase , the exponential factor has to be real .",
    "this means that @xmath100 or @xmath101 precisely the same values as for the parisi equation @xcite . for these values of @xmath102 , the exponential factor in ( [ r ] )",
    "becomes @xmath103 , giving rise to the left ( + 1 ) and right ( -1 ) moving fields respectively .",
    "this behaviour is in fact an intrinsic property of the inviscid goy model , and stem from the quadratic terms and the complex conjugation .",
    "this property of selecting specific phases might explain the period - three organisation of the pulses in the forced goy model as noted by okkels & jensen @xcite .    the simplest case , on which we shall concentrate below , is @xmath104 ; a completely imaginary field moving to the right .",
    "we thus let @xmath105 and dropping the tildes we get the real equation @xmath106 the behaviour of ( [ equ : w ] ) using a cosine - bump as initial condition ( [ ini ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntplot2 ] .",
    "the initial bump splits into a number of pulses with the same shape but different heights .",
    "the velocity of each pulse was measured to be @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the height of the pulse .",
    "two pulses can pass through each other after a time delay produced by the collision ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ntplot2 ] , right ) .",
    "these facts seem to indicate that the model ( [ equ : w ] ) is exactly integrable  although , as we shall see later , probably not in terms of analytic functions .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the system is discrete and therefore the shape of a pulse deforms slightly in time .",
    "despite this , one can actually obtain a very precise shape function for the pulse , simply by measuring the field @xmath109 continuously in time at a given point in the lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] )    the most characteristic feature of eq .",
    "( [ w * ] ) compared to the original goy model , is the disappearance of the middle term .",
    "it should be noted that other variants of shell models display another limit .",
    "an example is the helicity - conserving shell models @xcite where in the @xmath86 limit the right term disappears , while the middle term is preserved .",
    "this makes the equation qualitatively different .",
    "we shall now show that the continuum limit of ( [ equ : w ] ) is non - trivial and thus that the form of the pulses might be unusual . by expanding @xmath109 in a taylor - series and retaining , on the right - hand - side of ( [ equ : w ] ) terms",
    "@xmath110 with @xmath111 we get the continuum limit @xmath112 where again the subscripts denote differentiation .    using the identity",
    "@xmath113 the continuum model can be written : @xmath114 to study the asymptotics , we shall start by omitting the last term .",
    "the resulting equation @xmath115 strongly resembles the korteweg de vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "we shall refer to it as the quadratic korteweg de vries ( qkdv ) equation .",
    "let us briefly review how the solitons of the kdv equations are found .",
    "we look for pulse solutions of the kdv equation @xmath116 which are only a function of @xmath117 , so that ( [ kdv ] ) becomes @xmath118 now we can integrate once to get @xmath119 since we are interested in a pulse where the lhs approaches 0 as @xmath120 we must take @xmath121 .",
    "the resulting equation is that of a newtonian particle moving in time @xmath63 in the potential @xmath122 energy conservation has the form @xmath123 again the boundary conditions dictate that @xmath124 and we can solve ( [ e ] ) as @xmath125 this leads to the @xmath126 for @xmath127 but for our purposes the most important point is that the soliton corresponds to the homoclinic orbit starting from the potential hill - top @xmath97 at @xmath128 and returning back at @xmath129 .",
    "the quadratic nature of the hill - top means that the integral for @xmath130 _ diverges _ logarithmically for @xmath131 and thus the soliton extends to infinity with an exponential tail in both directions .",
    "we now look for a pulse solutions of ( [ qkdv ] ) and let @xmath132 , so that ( [ qkdv ] ) becomes @xmath133 again we can integrate once to get @xmath134 and , if at some ( finite or infinite ) point the left hand side vanishes , we must take @xmath135 .",
    "this means that we are looking for pulses with @xmath136 . to make a newtonian problem out of this",
    "we now introduce the variable @xmath137",
    ". then we get @xmath138 which is potential motion in the potential @xmath139 where @xmath140 and the total energy ( [ e ] ) must again be 0 .",
    "thus the solution can again be written as ( [ sol ] ) , but this time the integral converges at @xmath97 so we can write explicitly for the solution which vanishes at @xmath141 : @xmath142 which can be inverted as @xmath143    we verify that @xmath144 but now the solution has support only on the interval @xmath145 $ ] . outside of",
    "that it is identically zero which means that there is a shock in @xmath146 at those points .",
    "the strength of this shock will presumably diminish when higher order approximations to ( [ equ : w ] ) is used .",
    "but one can easily see that the term @xmath147 which we omitted from ( [ cont1 ] ) will not change this fact ( although it will probably alter the simple solution ( [ ksol1 ] ) ) . closely to the right of @xmath141 , @xmath148 .",
    "thus @xmath149 and @xmath150 both go linearly in @xmath63 ( and balance ) , whereas @xmath151 and @xmath147 both go like @xmath152 and do not alter the asymptotics for @xmath153 .",
    "this will be verified explicitly in the next section .",
    "it is possible to take the term @xmath147 , which we omitted in ( [ exp3 ] ) explicitly into account @xcite . multiplying ( [ exp3 ] ) with @xmath154 on both sides",
    ", we can rewrite this as : @xmath155 if we again assume an uniform propagation with constant velocity @xmath52 , then @xmath156 is only a function of @xmath157 , and the equation above reduces to @xmath158 which can immediately be integrated to yield : @xmath159 the non - trivial solution must therefore satisfy @xmath160 with solution in the form of the `` compact '' soliton @xmath161 analogously to ( [ ksol1 ] ) but no solutions decaying to @xmath162 at infinity .",
    "this approach is tied to the existence of a conserved energy given by : @xmath163 , which is conserved only if @xmath164 can be written as a total derivative in @xmath63 : @xmath165 but if we furthermore assume a dependence only on @xmath157 , then the above equation reduces to an equation of total derivatives : @xmath166 which can be integrated to give : @xmath167 to have finite - energy solitons , @xmath109 must go to zero at infinity .",
    "if furthermore @xmath168 goes to zero as @xmath109 goes to zero , the constant must be zero .",
    "we can then divide by @xmath169 and the equation reduces to @xmath170    keeping terms up to @xmath171th order in the derivatives in equation ( [ equ : w ] ) in the continuum limit , we get : @xmath172 miraculously , this can be rewritten as @xmath173 so that @xmath174 equation ( [ solution ] ) is then : @xmath175 which might have non - trivial soliton - solutions as long as the last term equals @xmath52 at large @xmath157 .",
    "so for large @xmath157 , we must have : @xmath176 or , by integration : @xmath177 where c is some integration - constant .",
    "now multiply this with @xmath178 : @xmath179 and integrate again @xmath180 where no extra constant arises , because of the boundary - condition at infinity .",
    "thus @xmath181 if @xmath182 , the 2nd term dominates asymptotically , and we get @xmath183 for large @xmath157 . on the other hand if @xmath184 then @xmath185 for large @xmath157 . in both cases @xmath156 does not decay to zero as @xmath157 goes to infinity .",
    "so again there are no soliton - solutions , that decay to zero at infinity .      the strange appearance of the solitons is closely linked to the fact that @xmath109 decays to zero asymptotically .",
    "if @xmath187 for @xmath120 , the pulse will decay exponentially to this value far away just as in the kdv case .",
    "the difference is that the constant @xmath188 now no longer vanishes . instead @xmath189 and the potential acquires the form @xmath190 now , for @xmath191 and small @xmath192 , @xmath193 so the potential acquires a small hill top at @xmath194 .",
    "this hill top is non singular ( albeit in a very small region ) and we get back to the usual situation ( like kdv ) where the soliton spreads over the entire region with an exponential tail . near @xmath194 we get from ( [ sol ] ) @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "thus the solution decays as @xmath197 where @xmath198 .",
    "thus the decay length @xmath199 .",
    "the results obtained in the continuum limit in the previous section are not born out by simulations .",
    "the pulses do not seem to have compact support , but decay far away .",
    "the decay in not exponential , but seems to more rapid .",
    "we shall now give an estimate of this decay and subsequently try to refine it .",
    "let us approximate the derivative in ( [ equ : w ] ) as @xmath200 .",
    "further , expecting a rapid decay , we shall neglect @xmath201 and @xmath202 compared to @xmath127 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "thus we simplify ( [ equ : w ] ) to @xmath205    now let @xmath206 whereby we find @xmath207 this recursion relation is identical to the one for the fibonacci numbers , and in general @xmath208 will grow like @xmath209 . to determine @xmath2 ,",
    "assume that @xmath210 which should be valid at large @xmath63 .",
    "inserting into ( [ fib ] ) gives us @xmath211 with the ( positive ) solution @xmath212 the so - called _",
    "golden mean_. this gives the extremely rapid decay @xmath213 with some positive constant @xmath214 .",
    "this rather unusual behaviour is extremely well represented by the numerical solution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse ] ) .    to refine this ,",
    "assume that @xmath215 inserting this into ( [ equ : w ] ) and cancelling a factor of @xmath216 ( using ( [ gm ] ) ) we get @xmath217 where @xmath218 .",
    "if the function @xmath219 is `` reasonable '' the last term can be dropped and we get @xmath220 and we can get the asymptotic behaviour @xmath221 by matching the first term on the left hand side to the right hand side .",
    "thus @xmath222 with @xmath223 and the solution takes the form @xmath224 note that @xmath214 is still not determined and we presumably need to solve for the whole soliton structure to get this constant .",
    "as seen in section [ sec : asymp ] pulses converging to @xmath225 decay exponentially .",
    "this is born out by out numerics and we now give a method to obtain the asymptotic behaviour of a pulse solution .",
    "we consider @xmath226 for the field @xmath227 we make the expansion @xmath228 hence we have @xmath229 thus we have the recursion relation @xmath230 although the recursion relation is non - linear , it turns out that it can be solved successively in terms of the two constants @xmath231 and @xmath232 . for @xmath233",
    "we get @xmath234 giving a relation between the constant background @xmath231 , the width @xmath3 , and the velocity @xmath52 . for @xmath235",
    "we obtain @xmath236 similarly , for @xmath237 we get @xmath238 it is straightforward , but tedious , to continue this calculation ( we have computed @xmath239 and @xmath240 ) .    to show that ( [ ansatz ] ) is a solution , we need to show that the coefficients @xmath241 obtained from the recursion relation ( [ recursion ] ) are such that the sum in ( [ ansatz ] ) is either convergent or borel summable .",
    "we have not succeeded in this in general .",
    "however , it is possible to show convergence when the width @xmath3 is large , and also presumably when @xmath3 is small .",
    "let us consider @xmath3 to be large .",
    "the velocity then becomes @xmath242 > from the recursion relation ( [ recursion ] ) we get a solution of the form @xmath243 the corresponding asymptotic solution can be found by performing the sum in ( [ ansatz ] ) , @xmath244    numerically , one can easily generate an `` exact '' solution by eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) using the recursion relation eq .",
    "( [ recursion ] ) .",
    "of course the solution exists only if the coefficients @xmath245 converge .",
    "we ohave observed that the radius of convergence in parameter space has a `` hole '' around the point @xmath246 .",
    "this is not surprising because this expansion is only valid on non - zero background and from the structure of the recursion relations it is clear that @xmath247 leads to a trivial case where @xmath248 for all @xmath249 .",
    "away , from the open set around @xmath247 we find a very fast convergence of the series .",
    "an example of the obtained solution is shown in figure [ fig : fig ] .",
    "note that formally we can apply this expansion also to the case treated in section [ sec : const ] , where @xmath131 for @xmath250 : at first sight this seems to require @xmath251 , which does nt work .",
    "however one has to keep in mind that the results of the previous section shows that in this case @xmath3 must be negative , indeed @xmath252 and this means that we have an expansion in terms of _ growing _ exponentials .",
    "the background value @xmath253 is therefore not given simply by @xmath231 in this limit , but all higher terms will contribute to it .",
    "when @xmath60 is slightly above unity , the main difference between our zero - spacing model and the real goy model seems to be the acceleration of the bursts seen e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "letting @xmath255 in ( [ equ : goyw ] ) and retaining helicity conservation ( @xmath256 ) we see that our inviscid model ( [ w * ] ) , in lowest order of @xmath257 , becomes @xmath258 for purely imaginary @xmath109 this is @xmath259 in the continuum limit , neglecting all higher order derivatives we get @xmath260 from which we clearly see the acceleration caused by the last term .",
    "note that this equation preserves energy conservation in the form @xmath261 , but now we have to remember the transformation leading to ( [ equ : goyw ] ) , i.e. @xmath262 , where @xmath263 . thus ( [ equ : conteps ] ) can be written @xmath264 which shows that the appropriate shock - condition is @xmath265 } { [ w^2 e^{-2\\epsilon x } ] } }   \\label{shock}\\ ] ] where @xmath266 is the velocity of the shock and @xmath267 $ ] denotes the discontinuity of the quantity @xmath63 accross the shock .",
    "since @xmath109 vanish on one side of the shock we get @xmath268    the characteristic equations for ( [ equ : conteps ] ) are @xmath269 and @xmath270 the latter can be integrated as @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the initial field taken as a function of the initial coordinate @xmath273 .",
    "the second characteristic equation can now be integrated as @xmath274    thus each characteristic ends in a singularity at time @xmath275 .",
    "never the less it is perhaps not obvious that the shocks also have to end in a singularity at a finite time . to investigate this",

    "the shock velocity is @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the edge of the shock .",
    "the natural variable is however @xmath273 and we thus express the shock - condition as @xmath278 on performing the differentiations of ( [ charx ] ) with @xmath273 and @xmath279 and inserting the solution ( [ charw ] ) for @xmath109 we get @xmath280    { \\frac{dx_0}{dt}}= - 2 w_0   \\label{shockdif}\\ ] ]    to make further progress we must know the form of @xmath272 . in our simulations of bursts",
    ", we took distributions like ( [ ksol1 ] ) , which are strictly zero outside the interval @xmath281 $ ] and approach the ends of the interval with zero slope .",
    "thus , close to @xmath282 ( which must dominate at large times ) the form will be @xmath283 with this assumption ( [ shockdif ] ) becomes : @xmath284 where @xmath285 .",

    "therefore we must assume that @xmath293 does not decay to zero and the dominant terms are now @xmath294 which gives the decay @xmath295 .",
    "this solution does nt work either , since the solution ( [ charw ] ) only makes sense asymptotically if @xmath296 as @xmath286 .",
    "we therefore conclude that , within the approximation leading to the continuum limit ( [ equ : conteps ] ) , the position of the shock will diverge to infinity at a finite time .",
    "it is not clear whether this behaviour is seen in the discrete equation as well([equ : weps ] ) .",
    "it is then clear that a pulse reach the dissipative range in finite time .",
    "this behaviour is qualitative the same as was found for the parisi equation .",
    "in this section we study the lyapunov exponents of the goy model in the limit of @xmath93 .",
    "since we aim at keeping the size of the inertial range fixed , the number of shells must also be varied as a function of @xmath60 , if the `` external '' parameters , i.e. , viscosity and forcing are kept fixed at @xmath297 .",

    "next , the tangent vector is normalised @xmath316 and this vector is used as a seed for a new integration over the time @xmath313 i.e. propagated forward to @xmath317 . generalising this argument we obtain the ith increment @xmath318 and the maximal lyapunov exponent",

    "the lower curve is the one related to the conservation of both energy and helicity .",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent remains in this case nearly constant in a large interval of @xmath60-values and then finally drops to zero . in the case where only energy is conserved ( the upper curves ) there is a maximum around @xmath80 after which also this decreases towards zero .",
    "based on these numerical results we conclude that the goy model does not exhibit chaotic dynamics in the zero - spacing limit . similar behavior has been observed recently in a shell model containing two fields @xcite .",
    "here it has been observed @xcite that the intermittency corrections disappear in the limit @xmath24 .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to study the dynamical behavior of single burst motion on a vanishing background in various shell models .",
    "the motion of single bursts is important for the understanding of intermittent behavior in turbulence .",
    "indeed it is believed that the presence of intermittency causes the corrections to the classical kolmogorov theory which manifest itself as multiscaling of higher order structure functions . in the present paper",
    "we have studied the motion of a single burst in three different versions of shell models :    1 .",
    "the standard goy model when the shell spacing approches , but is different , from zero ; 2 .   the parisi continuum limit of the goy model ; 3 .",
    "the zero - spacing of the goy model where helicity conservation is kept .    in all cases",
    "we observe that an initial disturbance splits up in a left- and a right - moving part . in case 1 ) the pulse retains its shape and whereas the right moving part accelerates , the left - moving part decellerates . in case 2 ) an initial disturbance splits into left- and right - moving shocks . the right - moving shock accelerates and its position diverges to infinity in a finite time .",
    "finally , in case 3 ) the shape retains its `` solitary '' form and does not turn into a shock . here",
    "the velocity also remains constant and the solitons pass through each other with a slight phase shift but without changing their shapes , completely as found in integrable field theories .",
    "we have analytically calculated the motion of the shocks in case 2 ) by means of characteristics . in case 3 ) we have analytically estimated the asymptotic shape of the solitary wave and find that it decreases super exponentially with a decay constant given by the golden mean . on a non - vanishing background we have on the other hand found that the decay of the soliton is a standard exponential . from numerical simulations in case 1 ) , we have estimated the maximal lyapunov exponent and found that it vanishes in the limit of zero - spacing , although the the motion remains chaotic for finite spacing .",
    "this results is expected since , as we have shown earlier , the continuum parisi limit resembles the burgers equation and gas theory and is in fact exacly soluble by the method of characteristics .",
    "we hope that our findings could be a starting point for a more detailed understanding of structure of intermittency , in particular of how the presence of isolated bursts give rise to corrections to classical scaling",

    "<S> the reasons behind the apparent success of the shell models still remains unclear . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> an attempt will be made to examine the detailed behaviour of one particular shell model  the so - called goy model by gledzer - ohkitani - yamada @xcite in the limit where the ration between the wave number of successive shells approach unity  which we shall refer to as the zero - spacing limit .    </S>",

    "<S> this equation does not form pulses , but rather forms shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the parisi equation around the quiescent fixed point is studied in @xcite and the results are briefly reviewed in section [ sec : parisi ] . </S>",
    "<S> pulses in the quiescent state are , however , seen in the zero - spacing limit of the goy model . </S>",
    "<S> the equation governing the zero - spacing limit is derived in section [ sec : zero ] and the qualitative behaviour of our model is illustrated through numerical simulations . in section [ sec : pulses ] a continuum version of the zero - spacing limit is proposed , and a solution for a pulse is derived . </S>",
