    "due to their technological importance in a multitude of application fields , artificial photonic materials have become a very active research area in recent years . in this context ,",
    "photonic crystal structures with their unique transmission and reflection spectra provide one of the most influential approaches .",
    "in particular , the occurrence of photonic band gaps in these periodically modulated materials  @xcite fascinates scientists from all fields and offers novel possibilities to control and guide the propagation of light  @xcite .",
    "photonic crystal fibers  @xcite provide a prominent example to demonstrate the relevance of structured materials for photonic applications .",
    "their internal microstructure facilitates tunable zero dispersion wavelengths and very high nonlinearities which make these fibers   for instance   highly convenient for supercontinuum generation  @xcite .",
    "while this application illustrates the significant influence of structured materials on light and light propagation , photons in turn can be highly useful to structure material properties as well .",
    "the emerging field of laser - assisted material processing , be it for example holographic laser lithography  @xcite or direct femtosecond laser writing  @xcite , accounts for this insight .",
    "combining both aspects   light - induced material structuring on the one and the influence of structured media on the propagation characteristics of light on the other hand   leads us to the concept of optically induced photonic structures .",
    "materials that change their properties due to light whereupon light itself reacts on the changed material environment provide the necessary link in order to control and guide light by light itself .",
    "however , modulated light fields required for an efficient light induced material structuring also have important applications in other areas . for example optical tweezing and micrometer particle assembly rely on corresponding optical potentials  @xcite , and atom traps for bose - einstein condensates are based on optical lattices as well  @xcite . in this respect , the new concepts for complex photonic lattices presented in the following will add significantly to all these physical fields .",
    "among all the different realizations of optically induced photonic structures , the optical induction of photonic lattices in photorefractive strontium barium niobate ( sbn ) crystals  @xcite is particularly flexible .",
    "this specific approach takes advantage of sbn s electro - optic properties and therewith allows to achieve highly reconfigurable refractive index distributions with various geometries .",
    "physically , the induced refractive index modulation is caused by the photorefractive effect  @xcite . under illumination with a spatially modulated intensity distribution   the so - called lattice wave   charge carriers in the medium are excited via photoionisation and redistributed in an externally applied electric field . inside the photorefractive crystal",
    ", this redistribution results in a reversible macroscopic space - charge field which in turn modulates the refractive index by means of the electro - optic effect .",
    "this concept of optically induced two - dimensional photonic lattices facilitates new insights in various fields of physical science and has been utilized to demonstrate for instance discrete solitons  @xcite , anderson localization  @xcite , as well as zener tunneling and bloch oscillations  @xcite .    while up to now only rather simple lattice geometries",
    "have been studied in this field , we show that the concept of optically structured photonic materials is not limited to such basic patterns . in the following ,",
    "a new induction approach is introduced which enables the fabrication of photonic structures with various complex geometries .    in order to generate a two - dimensional photonic lattice inside a photosensitive material",
    ", the intensity profile of the inducing lattice beam has to be modulated in the two transverse dimensions but invariant in the direction of propagation .",
    "all beams satisfying this condition share the property that their transverse spatial frequency components lie on a circle in the corresponding fourier plane  @xcite . therefore , the general fourier spectrum of a nondiffracting beam can conveniently be written in polar coordinates as @xmath0 with a radial spatial frequency @xmath1 and with @xmath2 being the dirac delta function , limiting the spectral distribution to a circle with radius @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 gives the complex fourier spectrum on this circle as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath5 while @xmath6 accounts for the possibility to rotate the whole transverse structure by this angle .",
    "this general spectrum indeed leads to ideal nondiffracting beams whose transverse intensity profiles remain invariant for arbitrary propagation distances but at the same time carry infinite energy  @xcite . since actual experimental realizations naturally require a finite total energy of the beam , the nondiffracting character can merely be approximated .",
    "therefore , a rigorous theoretical description of the beam propagation would have to take finite apertures into account , and usually this is modelled as helmholtz - gauss beams  @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum then is given by a convolution of  ( [ eq : fourierspectrum_general ] ) with the spectrum of the transverse envelope .",
    "however , we intend to use the given equations for the calculation of the input to our experimental setup and thus refer only to the ideal formulation given above .",
    "theoretical investigations revealed four different fundamental families of propagation invariant light fields .",
    "depending on the underlying real space coordinate system , a distinction is drawn between discrete , bessel , mathieu , and weber nondiffracting beams  @xcite .",
    "the family of discrete nondiffracting beams can be considered as a set of plane wave interference patterns .",
    "the classical two beam interference is a well - known member of this family showing a nondiffracting stripe pattern as its transverse intensity profile . besides stripes , all other regular plane tilings  ",
    "i.e.  square , hexagonal , and triangular patterns   have been realized with discrete nondiffracting beams as well  @xcite .    while the experimental implementation of discrete nondiffracting beams is comparatively simple ,",
    "the other three beam families require a far more elaborated approach . by means of computer - controlled light modulators",
    ", we are able to spatially modulate both amplitude and phase of an incident light wave .",
    "this novel technique permits us to generate arbitrary lattice waves out of all families of nondiffracting beams within one single setup .",
    "the experimental setup used for the generation of these complex nondiffracting intensity patterns and their utilization for the optical induction of photonic structures is schematically shown in figure  [ fig : setup ] .        a beam from a frequency - doubled nd : yag laser at a wavelength of   illuminates a first programmable light modulator .",
    "this modulator imprints a spatial phase pattern specifically calculated for the desired nondiffracting wave onto the illuminating beam .",
    "subsequently , this first modulator is imaged onto a second one which modulates the amplitude of the beam according to the calculated intensity distribution of the nondiffracting lattice wave .",
    "the modulated beam is finally imaged by a high numerical aperture telescope onto the input face of an sbn crystal with a length of . since all nondiffracting beams share the discussed property that their transverse spatial frequency components lie on a circle in the corresponding fourier plane  @xcite , spatial filters within the fourier planes of the two involved telescopes ensure this constraint .    ) , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",

    "a camera is used to analyze the intensity distribution at the output face of the crystal . in addition , this imaging part of the setup is mounted on a translation stage and can be moved to image different transverse planes of the lattice wave . after removing the crystal , this tool allows for an analysis of the wave s nondiffracting intensity profile in air as well .    to illustrate the nondiffracting propagation of a lattice wave in our setup , we generated a prototypical discrete nondiffracting beam ( cf .",

    "even though these discrete beams seem to be an obvious example for nondiffracting propagation , this fascinating phenomenon historically was discovered by analytical considerations leading to a field distribution radially proportional to a zeroth order bessel function of the first kind  @xcite . up to now , this fundamental bessel beam is typically generated with a classical optical approach using an axicon  @xcite .    besides this basic solution of the nondiffracting propagation problem in cylindrical coordinates , field distributions according to higher order bessel functions   described in fourier space by @xmath16 with @xmath14 being the order  @xcite   show nondiffracting propagation as well  @xcite . only their experimental preparation is much more difficult compared to the zeroth order case .",

    "one member of this complex beam family ( an even mathieu beam with @xmath24 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) is shown as an example in figure  [ fig : mathieu ] .    while bessel beams are described in cylindrical coordinates , mathieu beams",

    "in conclusion , we presented a new concept of optical lattice wave generation .",
    "for all four families of nondiffracting beams , we are able to transfer calculated field distributions into real nondiffracting lattice waves .",
    "exemplarily , the potential of these complex lattice beams in the field of artificial materials and structures was shown by demonstrating the optical induction of complex discrete , bessel , mathieu , and weber photonic lattices in a nonlinear photorefractive medium .    while all presented photonic structures",
    "were designed to be invariant in one distinct direction , our induction concept can easily be modified in order to introduce a modulation in this direction as well  @xcite .",
    "in addition , techniques known from the field of holographic data storage could be used to multiplex lattices with different feature size , thus facilitating superperiodic structures  @xcite and   since the four discussed families of nondiffracting beams each are complete and orthogonal  @xcite   even optical series expansions of arbitrary patterns  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the choice of the photosensitive medium is not restricted to the demonstrated photorefractive case .",
    "other materials   for example photoresists  @xcite   could also serve as an adequate platform .    at the same time , the presented concept and therewith all the complex nondiffracting beams can be used for the generation of optical potentials in fields like atom optics or cold gases as well .",
