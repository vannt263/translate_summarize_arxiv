    "inflationary cosmology has been the paradigm in modern cosmology  @xcite .",
    "the accelerating expansion in the early universe not only solves the flatness and horizon problem  @xcite but also provides the density perturbations which grow to the large - scale structure  @xcite .",
    "the false vacuum energy inducing quasi - de sitter expansion during inflation is transferred into the energy of radiation with high temperature through reheating processes , so that the filling of early universe with high - density and high - temperature thermal plasma is realized .",
    "it is often expected that such a hot universe directly connects to the hot big bang universe in which big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) takes place after one second .",
    "however , there are various possibilities of nontrivial evolution scenarios where a stage dominated by temporal matter or vacuum energy would exist between the primordial inflation and the onset of bbn . in addition , through the evolution of the early universe from a very high - energy to low - energy region , it is supposed that the universe has undergone a series of cosmological phase transitions and the symmetry breaking of particle theory , e.g. , a large - gauge ( sub)group of grand unified theory ( gut ) , peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry  @xcite , and the electroweak gauge symmetry in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "there are two well - motivated symmetries expected to be broken at an intermediate scale from a particle physics viewpoint .",
    "one is a pq symmetry introduced to solve the strong cp problem in the sm .",
    "the other is @xmath1 symmetry which might be gauged symmetry at a high - energy scale and its breakdown would generate majorana masses of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos to account for neutrino oscillation phenomena  @xcite .",
    "a scalar field to break the pq symmetry has small couplings to sm particles suppressed by the pq breaking scale @xmath3 , also known as the axion decay constant .",
    "the pq scalar field with a `` wine bottle '' potential could be produced as coherent oscillation due to its scalar nature and temporally dominate the energy density of the universe if its decay rate is very small because of suppressed couplings .",
    "the radial direction of the pq scalar   would mostly decay into axions or sm particles through loop processes .",
    "for the ksvz axion model  @xcite where heavy quarks carrying a pq charge are indeed heavy enough , this could happen .",
    "for the dfsz axion model  @xcite where axion multiplets have direct couplings with the sm higgs field , this could be the case if its coupling between the pq field and the sm higgs field is small enough so that the pq radial scalar decay into higgs bosons is suppressed .",
    "thus , associated with the breakdown of the global @xmath4 symmetry , the pq scalar likely decays into mostly axions in this model and can not reheat the universe well .",
    "those overproduced massless axions act as dark radiation which is nowadays stringently constrained .",
    "the planck data show the effective number of neutrino spices  @xcite @xmath5 and the difference from the sm prediction is the so - called @xmath6 .",
    "this dark radiation axion is an unwanted relic and needs to be diluted anyway .",
    "thermal inflation is a well - known mechanism to dilute such unwanted relics  @xcite and is driven by a scalar field @xmath7 , often called the flaton , whose scalar potential @xmath8 is of the symmetry - breaking type with a large vev . in a hot universe after the reheating of the primordial inflation ,",
    "the scalar field @xmath7 is thermally excited and stays at the origin @xmath9 because the thermal correction in the effective potential makes the origin of the potential to a temporal minimum with its large false vacuum energy @xmath10 .",
    "when the false vacuum energy becomes comparable to the background radiation energy density , the universe starts accelerating expansion again .",
    "since the radiation energy density is redshifted away as its temperature decreases exponentially , the origin @xmath9 becomes unstable and the inflation terminates . with the enormous entropy production by the @xmath7 decay ,",
    "unwanted relics can be diluted away .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the condition of successful thermal inflation to dilute axions generated by the late decay of the dominated pq scalar field .",
    "if this flaton @xmath7 is a gauge singlet and has an ( approximate ) global @xmath0 , then the axions associated with the flaton could be produced again as shown in ref .",
    "thus , in order not to have an axion overproduction problem after thermal inflation , we assume that a flaton field is charged under a local @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we also discuss the implication in the case that this local @xmath0 symmetry is identified with gauged @xmath2 .",
    "we describe the outline of the scenario with a thermal inflation period driven by canonical scalar field @xmath7 , which is responsible for breaking its local @xmath0 symmetry . for illustrative purposes , in this section",
    ", we assume the scalar potential for thermal inflation is of the wine bottle form .",
    "the scalar potentials for @xmath7 are given by @xmath11 a flaton field @xmath7 is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium through interactions with particles in the hot thermal bath and , hence , the thermal correction ; in fact , the thermal mass term , @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the temperature of the thermal plasma , is added in the scalar potential . here ,",
    "@xmath14 is parametrizing the coefficient , while sometimes we may use an effective coupling with another particle @xmath15 instead of @xmath14 in the rest of this paper .    before evaluating the number of @xmath16-folds in a relativistic axion - dominated universe , we here review how to estimate it in the standard radiation - dominated universe . when the false vacuum energy @xmath10 dominates over the energy density of the background radiation @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , a thermal inflation starts .",
    "we define the initial temperature of a thermal inflation by @xmath19 a thermal inflation terminates when the temperature drops below the critical temperature @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 and the origin @xmath9 becomes unstable . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we use the final temperature @xmath22 instead of @xmath20 .",
    "we find the initial and final temperature , and the number of @xmath16-folds as @xmath23 here , the subscript @xmath24 in @xmath25 indicates , for later convenience , that the scalar potential is quartic .",
    "we find several number of @xmath16-folds by thermal inflation can be realized only for @xmath26 from eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) .",
    "one may find that @xmath27 would be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for the gauge coupling of @xmath7 for gauged @xmath0 and yukawa couplings , respectively , to a fermion @xmath31 as in @xmath32 on the other hand , the scalar self - coupling @xmath33 also receives corrections like @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the summation with respect to degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , in fact , the condition ( [ cond : lam - g ] ) can be satisfied only if accurate cancellations happen in eq .",
    "( [ looplambda ] ) .",
    "realization of a thermal inflation by the potential ( [ pot : wb ] ) is unstable against radiative correction , and in this sense , successful thermal inflation by this potential is difficult .",
    "this would be a reason why lyth and stewart have considered the flaton potential lifted by higher - order nonrenormalizable terms in the original `` thermal inflation '' paper  @xcite , as we will also do .    before turning to higher - order potential",
    ", we estimate the number of @xmath16-folds in the axion - dominated universe by the dominated pq scalar field decay , because the above eqs .",
    "( [ ti ] ) , ( [ tf ] ) , and ( [ n ] ) have been derived in a radiation - dominated universe background . in the ksvz model",
    ", the pq scalar mostly decays mostly into two axions and a little into sm particles .",
    "we use @xmath36 to parametrize the decay branching ratio of the pq scalar into sm particles .",
    "then we have @xmath37 since thermal inflation starts in the axion - dominated universe , the condition @xmath38 is rewritten as @xmath39 we obtain @xmath40 in the axion - dominated universe , the temperature interval between @xmath41 and @xmath22 becomes shorter because the energy density of thermalized radiation is subdominant . as a result ,",
    "the number of @xmath16-folds also becomes small , which can been seen as the effect of the third term in eq .",
    "( [ na ] ) .",
    "we list various physical quantities about thermal inflation in table  [ table : wb ] .",
    "one can easily find the hierarchy of inequality  ( [ cond : lam - g ] ) for realizing even just @xmath42 .",
    ".quantities in thermal inflation by the potential ( [ pot : wb ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : higher ]",
    "as we have seen , if the pq scalar field dominates the energy density of the universe , its decay produces many axions , and the universe ends up with relativistic axion domination . when the total energy density @xmath43 from dominated axion @xmath44 and subdominant radiation @xmath45 becomes comparable with @xmath8 , @xmath46 , the thermal inflation begins",
    ". then we have @xmath47 here @xmath48 stands for the time when the thermal inflation ends . after the thermal inflation",
    ", @xmath7 decays into sm particles and potentially non - sm particles again .",
    "let us define the decay branching ratio into non - sm particles @xmath49 for later convenience . by using eq .",
    "( [ v2rho_a ] ) , the ratio of axion to radiation is expressed as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the number of @xmath16-folds of the thermal inflation and the decay rate of @xmath7 . the resultant axion dark radiation contribution is expressed in terms of @xmath6 as @xmath53      the reheating temperature after inflation is estimated as @xmath54 in the following , we estimate a reference value of the reheating temperature under the assumption of the instantaneous reheating @xmath55 , which gives the highest reheating temperature .",
    "the availability of baryogenesis mechanisms depends on the reheating temperature after thermal inflation @xmath56 .    for high enough reheating temperature @xmath57 gev ,",
    "thermal leptogenesis by the lightest heavy rh neutrino decay of those with hierarchical masses is one of the simplest scenarios of baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "nonthermal leptogenesis by rh neutrinos with hierarchical masses is available for a reheating temperature @xmath58 gev @xmath59 gev  @xcite .",
    "if this local @xmath0 is in fact the gauged @xmath2 symmetry , @xmath7 is identified with the higgs field to break this symmetry with the @xmath1 charge @xmath60 , and the decay @xmath7 into two rh neutrinos @xmath61 is nothing but nonthermal production of @xmath61 .    for @xmath62 gev , low - scale thermal leptogenesis requires an enhancement of cp violation . here",
    ", for information , we refer to two examples .",
    "one possibility is the so - called resonant leptogenesis , where two rh neutrino masses are strongly degenerated and cp violation is enlarged due to rh neutrino self - energy  @xcite .",
    "another way is an extension of the higgs sector .",
    "it has been shown that , in the so - called neutrinophilic higgs model , large enough cp violation can be obtained for the lightest rh neutrino mass of @xmath63 gev  @xcite .",
    "another promising scenario would be electroweak baryogenesis .",

    "although we comment on cases with @xmath64 , one should remember that realization of thermal inflation by the @xmath64 potential is , in general , difficult as stated above , so this is only for information purpose . in order to have a large enough cp violation @xmath66 in the @xmath61 decay , which is equivalent to the so - called davidson - ibarra bound of the lightest rh neutrino mass for leptogenesis @xmath67 gev  @xcite ,",
