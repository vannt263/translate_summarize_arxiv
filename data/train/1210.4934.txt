    "the search for the particle nature of dark matter is one of the oustanding open questions of modern physics .",
    "a broad program of research with a variety of promising and complementary approaches has become a major piece of experimental particle physics research .",
    "this includes searches for direct production at colliders , searches for dark matter interactions with standard model particles in large quiet underground detectors , and searches for signals of dark matter annhiliation into standard model particles in regions of the galaxy with large dark matter density .",
    "a clear signal of dark matter annihilation may be carried by gamma rays traveling to earth from regions in the galaxy with high dark - matter density .",
    "as the photons do not typically scatter after their production , the photon energy and direction are powerful handles for understanding the mechanism of dark matter annihiliation into standard model particles .",
    "one mechanism is annihilation resulting in quarks , which would hadronize and yield @xmath4 particles which in turn produce photons .",
    "the broad spectrum of such a process would give fairly low energy photons ( @xmath5 gev ) and may be difficult to distinguish from other sources .",
    "a clearer signature may appear from annihilation directly into two - body final states including a photon , though the rate would be smaller than continuum emission due to loop supression .",
    "rather than yielding a broad energy spectrum , this process would produce a photon with a well - defined energy ( a `` line '' ) .",
    "this makes a search for lines in the photon spectrum an important component of the dark matter program using fermi - lat data  @xcite .",
    "recently , observation of a feature with high local statistical significance at @xmath1 gev was reported  @xcite , with a source location 1 - 2 degrees away from the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "follow - up analyses suggested the possibility of two features , consistent with the spacing of lines expected from @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes  @xcite    in this paper , we study in detail the question of the location of the source of the photons in the features .",
    "we confirm the location of the photons in the feature at @xmath1 gev , and for the first time , locate the source of the photons in the feature at @xmath0 gev .",
    "we study whether the two are  individually or collectively  consistent with emission from a single source , as would be expected if they represent the @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes , as well as whether that source is consistent with a dark matter halo at the galactic center . in addition , we introduce a new approach to analyzing the data which uses the measured angles of the individual photons , rather than the median photon angles .",
    "a source of photons with a very narrow range of energies would appear in the spectrum of observed fermi - lat photons as a peak , due to finite energy resolution .",
    "previous analyses  @xcite have used the fermi - lat energy dispersion formula  @xcite to build a probability density function ( _ pdf _ ) for the reconstructed energies of photons from a line , and fit it to the observed spectrum .",
    "given the small size of the dataset , we seek to use the maximum available information about each photon to extract insight into the observed features .",
    "the energy resolution , for example , has a significant dependence on two other photon characteristics : @xmath6 , the incident angle relative to a line normal to the lat face , and the photon ` type ' which indicates whether the conversion happened in the front or back layers of the tracker  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf ] shows the reconstructed energy pdf for various choices of @xmath6 and type .",
    "this per - photon information is very pertinant to the analysis of this spectrum .",
    "if the photons in the peak were all well - measured , it would enhance the significance of the peak ; conversely , if they were all poorly - measured , it would degrade the significance .",
    "our approach is to reconstruct the distribution of @xmath7 , the true energy of photons striking the lat , rather than the distribution of @xmath8 , the reconstructed energy of each photon .",
    "the former distribution can account for the per - photon resolution , while the latter treats each photon equally .",
    "the reconstructed energy is related to the true energy by the pdf @xmath9 .",
    "we use bayes theorem to invert this relation and calculate @xmath10 where @xmath11 is taken from the full - sky photon energy spectrum .",
    "other choices of priors have negliglible effect , as the energy dispersion pdf is sharply peaked , see fig  [ fig : pdf ] .    the distribution of @xmath7 is then built as a kernel density estimate  @xcite with @xmath12 as the choice of kernel .",
    "other approaches  @xcite have used adaptive gaussian kernels , but our physically motivated choice of kernel reflects the asymmetric shape of the pdf and uses  for the first time  the per - photon measured incident angle rather than the median angle of the dataset .",
    "we use the publicly available fermi - lat data collected over 3.7 years .",
    "we use ` ultraclean ` photons with zenith angle @xmath13 100 to veto photons from earth as well as standard quality requirements  @xcite .",
    "we select a three - degree region around the galactic center .",
    "the observed photon counts in the three - degree region are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reco ] . the distribution of @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reso ] , with several choices of angle - dependence used to demonstrate the impact of this information .",
    "two choices demonstrates the range of possibilities , if all photons had the maximum or minimum possible energy resolutions .",
    "this demonstrates the potential importance of this information .",
    "the spectrum which uses the measured per - photon angles has peaks at 110 and 130 gev which are slightly degraded relative to a spectrum which uses the median photon angle . as the distribution of photons in the peak region and the background region have similar distributions of @xmath14 and conversion type  @xcite , there is not currently a large impact from using the per - photon information , but it remains a useful method to visualize the spectrum .",

    "we search for the most likely source position using a maximal likelihood fit of the observed photons to the expected spatial and energy distributions from dark matter halos .",
    "the unbinned likelihood is    @xmath16    where @xmath17 are the galactic coordinates of the center of the dark matter halo , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the background and signal normalizations , the index @xmath20 runs over observed photon energy and spatial parameters @xmath21 within the energy window surrounding the feature(s ) of interest , and @xmath22 is the dark matter halo pdf as a function of photon energy @xmath23 , incidence angle @xmath24 at spatial position @xmath25 given a dark matter halo centered at @xmath17 .",
    "the pdf @xmath26 accounts for per - photon spatial  @xcite and energy  @xcite resolution in the same spirit as the bayesian unfolding described above ; here we do not need to explicitly unfold , as we have included the per - photon information in the unbinned likelihood .",
    "the background pdf @xmath27 is built from a data - driven model , with the energy dependence coming from photons outside the three - degree region surrounding the galactic center , see figure  [ fig : bg_form ] .",
    "we find this to be reasonably consistent with a power law model used in previous analyses  @xcite .",
    "we use energy windows of @xmath28,[125,135]$ ] for the location of the feature at 110 gev and 130 gev , respectively , or both windows for the combined features . in the case of the two - feature analysis ( @xmath29 gev ) ,",
    "there are two @xmath26 terms in the likelihood , one for each peak .",
    "we use normalizations of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the @xmath0 and @xmath32 gev features , respectively .        the dark matter",
    "halo pdfs @xmath26 are derived from either nfw  @xcite or einasto  @xcite halo profiles ; the pdf in @xmath33 ) is calculated via the line - integral of the square of the dark matter density  @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath34 = 0.17 for the einasto model and @xmath35 = 20 kpc for both models .",
    "the position of the most likely values of the halo centers are given in table  [ tab : pos ] for both dm profiles and each of the features as well as the combined spectrum .",
    "in both cases , the feature at 130 gev appears to be displaced from the galactic center , as previously reported , but the 110 gev feature appears to be centered at the galactic origin .     of an nfw ( top ) or einasto ( botton ) dark matter halo , maximized seperately for the features at 130 gev , 110 gev , or the combined features . also shown",
    "are @xmath36 and @xmath37 uncertainty regions , see text for details.,title=\"fig : \" ]   of an nfw ( top ) or einasto ( botton ) dark matter halo , maximized seperately for the features at 130 gev , 110 gev , or the combined features . also shown",
    "are @xmath36 and @xmath37 uncertainty regions , see text for details.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure  [ fig : maps ] shows the most likely positions for each of the dark matter halo profiles and each of the energy spectrum features , as well as uncertainty regions .",
    "the uncertainty regions are calculated in a frequentist manner , using simulated experiments to determine the @xmath38 threshould which would contain the true @xmath17 position in 68% ( for @xmath36 ) or 95% ( for @xmath39 of the cases .",
    "if the two features were both due to dark matter annhililation processes , one would expect them to be co - located .",
    "figure  [ fig : peaks1deg ] shows the unfolded @xmath40 spectrum in a 1-degree circle surrounding each of the features ; in the spectrum which highlights the 130 gev feature , the 110 gev feature is suppressed , and vice versa .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : peaks1sigma ] shows the unfolded @xmath40 spectrum in the @xmath36 region surrounding each feature .",

    "this suggests that the two features of the energy spectrum may have spatially distinct sources , and these sources may themselves be offset from the galactic center . to evaluate the significance of the sources displacement from the galacter center and from each other a more rigorous analysis which accounts for uncertainties",
    "is performed below .",
    "if the observed features are both due to dark matter annhilation , then their locations in the sky depend only on the dark matter density and not the nature of the final state , @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and so should yield locations consistent with a single source . as shown above , we find that the sources of the @xmath0 and 130 gev features are seperated appreciably from each other , and that the @xmath1 feature is displaced from the galactic center .",
    "definitive conclusions , however , require analysis of the uncertainties involved , including the expected fluctuations of the measured source locations given the small number of photons in each feature .",
    "we seek to answer two questions :    * are the two features consistent with emission from a single source ? * are the features consistent with emission from a dark matter halo at the galactic center ?",
    "we answer these questions by comparing hypotheses using likelihood ratios .",
    "for example , we can probe whether the feature at @xmath41 gev is consistent with emission from the galactic center by evaluating    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the location which maximizes @xmath44 and @xmath45 serves as the null hypothesis .",
    "when @xmath43 is close to @xmath45 , the log of the likelihood ratio @xmath46 approaches zero ; when it is far from the origin , it becomes negative .",
    "we compare the measured value of @xmath46 to the expected distribution in simulated experiments from an nfw or einasto profile with a line at @xmath1 gev placed at ( 0,0 ) , see figures  [ fig : llr_ein](a ) and  [ fig : llr_nfw](a ) .",
    "while the value of @xmath46 indicates that the maximal position is displaced from the origin , it is consistent with the expected distribution of @xmath46 values when the dm halo is at the origin ; the @xmath47-values = 0.18 and 0.14 for einasto or nfw , respectively .",
    "distributions of @xmath46 for dm halos offset from the origin are also shown .",
    "we perform this analysis for the feature at @xmath0 gev as well , see figures  [ fig : llr_ein](b ) and  [ fig : llr_nfw](b ) . as this feature appears to be located close to @xmath45 ,",
    "the @xmath46 values are close to zero and entirely consistent with a dm halo at the galactic center .",
    "we repeat the analysis for the combined features at 110 and 130 gev , where we constrain them to have the same location , see figures  [ fig : llr_ein](c ) and  [ fig : llr_nfw](c ) . again",
    ", the @xmath46 values are consistent with a dm halo at the galactic center .    to address the question of whether the two features are more likely to be from a single source ( consistent with a dm interpretation ) or from two spatially distinct sources , we construct a likelihood ratio    @xmath48    where in one case we find the single location @xmath43 which maximizes @xmath44 for both features , and in the other we allow the two features to find individual maxima : @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    ". this @xmath46 will be zero if the individually optimized ( and possibly separated ) locations are consistent with the most likely single joint location , and positive if individually optimized ( and possibly separated ) locations give a better description of the data .",
    "again we compare to the expected distribution of the likelihood ratio in simulated experiments in which the two sources are co - located and find that the observed @xmath46 is consistent with a co - located source , see figures  [ fig : llr_ein](d ) and  [ fig : llr_nfw](d ) .",

    "in each case , we show the expected distribution in simulated experiments.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( 6,60)(a ) ( 45,60)(b ) ( 6,15)(c ) ( 68,15)(d )    ( 80,90 ) ( 0,0 ) ) or at the galactic center @xmath51 , in the case of the 130 gev feature ( a ) , the 110 gev feature ( b ) , or the combined features ( c ) . also shown",

    "we haved demonstrated via bayesian unfolding the potential importance of including the per - photon energy resolution , though for this dataset the results are little different from the standard approach of assuming the median angle and therefore resolution .",
