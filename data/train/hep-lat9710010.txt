    "in the phenomenological study of quark gluon plasma(qgp ) , when its bulk properties are concerned , the system of quarks and gluons is usually treated as gas or liquid",
    ". then the fundamental parameters of qgp such as transport coefficients , are very important information .",
    "the aim of this work is to calculate them from the fundamental theory of qcd .",
    "+ the calculation of transport coefficients is formulated in the framework of linear response theory of kubo@xcite .",
    "they are expressed by the space time integral of retarded green s function of energy momentum tensors at finite temperature . the shear viscosity @xmath2 is expressed as follows . @xmath3 similarly the bulk viscosity @xmath4 and heat conductivity @xmath5 are expressed in terms of the retarded green s function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 components of energy momentum tensor . in the pure gauge model the energy momentum tensors are written by the the field strength tensor .",
    "+ the direct calculation of the retarded green s function at finite temperature is very difficult . then the shortcut is to calculate matsubara green s function(@xmath8 ) and then by the analytic continuation",
    ", we obtain the retarded green s function at finite temperature . the analytic continuation is carried out by the use of the fact that the spectral function of fourier transform of the both green s functions is the same .",
    "for the spectral function we use the following simplest ansatz@xcite .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 partially represents the effects of the interactions and is related to the imaginary part of self energy . under this ansatz ,",
    "the transport coefficients are calculated as , @xmath11 where @xmath12 means @xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we notice that if @xmath15 or @xmath16 , transport coefficient becomes zero . in order to determine these parameters , at least three independent data points in @xmath8",
    "are required in the temperature direction . in the pioneering work of karsch and wyld@xcite , they performed lattice qcd calculations on @xmath17 lattice and the resolution was not enough to determine these three parameters independently .",
    "we carry out our simulation on @xmath18 lattice .",
    "we have started the the simulation from u(1 ) gauge theory .",
    "it is found that the fluctuation of @xmath8 is very large that it need about @xmath19 data for the determination of @xmath8 in the deconfined phase .",
    "further in the confined phase , the fluctuations become still larger and we could not obtain the green s functions even with the @xmath20 data@xcite .",
    "similar results are obtained in the case of su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "then in the calculation of su(3 ) gauge theory , we carry out our simulation only in the deconfined phase . +",
    "it is also found that the fluctuation of @xmath8 becomes larger as we proceed to @xmath21 .",
    "then it is a very important problem to reduce the fluctuation of @xmath8 .",
    "we find that by using the iwasaki s improved action , the fluctuation is much reduced as shown in fig.1 .",
    "then in the following we apply iwasaki s improved action for the simulation of su(3 ) gauge theory . + from roughly @xmath22 data , we obtain @xmath8 for @xmath6 and @xmath23 .",
    "but they have still rather large errors .",
    "the fit of @xmath8 with parameters in the spectral function given by eq.(2 ) is done with sals .",
    "the shear and bulk viscosities are calculated by these parameters by eqs.(3 ) and the error are estimated by the jackknife method .",
    "the results for them are shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is found that the bulk viscosity is zero within errors .",
    "this result is consistent with the arguments of s. gavin@xcite that in the pure gauge theory , the bulk viscosity and heat conductivity should be zero . in our calculation , @xmath8 of @xmath24 from which the heat conductivity is calculated , has large background and it has been impossible to get signal from it . + in order to know the shear viscosity in the physical unit , we should determine the lattice spacing @xmath25 in these @xmath26 values . for this purpose",
    "we have started to determine the finite temperature transition points @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "we made a histogram analysis on @xmath18 lattice .",
    "the results for the polyakov susceptibility are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the spacial volume is too small to make a precise determination of @xmath27 on our lattice , but we find that the transition region is @xmath29 . by using the finite size scaling formula and the transition temperature @xmath30 determined by tsukuba group @xcite and assuming asymptotic scaling for @xmath31 region , the lattice spacing is estimated . +",
    "the preliminary results for the shear viscosity in the physical unit are shown in fig.4 .",
    "it is found that it increases with temperature .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence is consistent with @xmath1 , because @xmath32 is almost independent of @xmath26 as shown in fig.2 and @xmath33 when @xmath34 is fixed .",
    "but clearly more accurate data are necessary .",
    "it is also seen that it seems finite around @xmath35 , which is slightly smaller than the typical hadron massess . what is the physical effects on the phenomenology of quark gluon plasma , when it has shear viscosity with this magnitudes , is a very interesting problem .",
    "we have obtaind the transport coefficients of quark gluon plasma from the lattice qcd calculation by using iwasaki s improved action , as shown in figs.2 and 4 . the shear viscosity increases with temperarure",
    "roughly as @xmath36        we could not calculate the @xmath8 in the confined phase@xcite .",
    "we think that this is because the energy momentum tensor operators should be written by the hadron fields , rather than the gluon fields . in order to certify this hypothsis ,",
    "we have started the calculation of gluon propagator at finite temperature with improved action .",
    "the preliminary results on the small lattice @xmath17 shows that in the confined phase , gauge copies are found in lattice version of lorentz gauge and the gluon propagators show the peculiar behavior , which nakamura group@xcite has found on the large lattice with standard action .",
