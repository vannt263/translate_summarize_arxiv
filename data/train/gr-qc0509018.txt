    "radio pulsars are interesting sources for currently operating gravitational wave detectors  @xcite . the positions and spin evolutions of these sources",
    "are well known from radio observations which reduce the parameter space considerably compared to all - sky searches for unknown neutron stars .",
    "in addition to simplifying the data analysis problem , the smaller parameter space in these _ targeted searches _ improves the sensitivity to gravitational waves by lowering the detection threshold .",
    "ligo and geo have so far conducted two searches for gravitational waves from radio pulsars using data from the s1 science run  @xcite and data from the s2 run  @xcite .",
    "neither of these searches provided a detection but upper limits were set on gravitational wave emission for selected pulsars . both of these analyses searched for gravitational waves at twice the rotational frequency of pulsars , where we would expect a signal from an asymmetric pulsar .",
    "in the s1 analysis , two techniques were used to set upper limits on gravitational wave emission from pulsar j1939 + 2134 ( the fastest rotating known millisecond pulsar )  @xcite : a bayesian time - domain method and a classical frequency - domain method .",
    "the main result from this s1 analysis was an upper limit on signals from pulsar j1939 + 2134 of @xmath0 with 95% confidence .    here",
    "we will focus on the time - domain bayesian method which is more suited for targeted sources  @xcite .",
    "the frequency - domain statistical technique used in the s1 paper is currently being used for broad all - sky searches for unknown sources , including einstein@home  @xcite .    for the ligo s2 run ,",
    "the time - domain search was expanded to include all well - known isolated pulsars with putative gravitational wave frequencies above 40hz  @xcite . using the s2 data , multi - detector upper limits were set on gravitational wave emission from 28 pulsars including j1939 + 2134 and the crab pulsar .",
    "the tightest limit on gravitational wave strain came from pulsar j1910 - 5959d with a 95% upper limit of @xmath1 . at the time of s2",
    "this was the lowest upper limit ever set on a pulsar by a gravitational wave detector .",
    "the four best limits on equatorial ellipticity for s2 came from the four closest pulsars j0030 + 0451 , j1024@xmath20719 , j1744@xmath21134 , and j2124@xmath23358 with 95% upper limits on the ellipticity of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the analysis of s3/s4 ligo and geo data is currently underway with more sensitive data and a larger selection of pulsars than in s2 .",
    "the main change in our search since s2 has been the addition of pulsars in binary systems .",
    "the timing for all sources was supplied by the pulsar group at jodrell bank observatory .",
    "we are currently analyzing s3/s4 data for gravitational waves from all known radio pulsars with @xmath7 for which the source parameters are known sufficiently well .",
    "this breaks down to a total of 93 pulsars of which 60 are binaries and 33 are isolated .",
    "the improved sensitivity of the detectors in s3/s4 promises to give interesting results for several sources . for the crab pulsar",
    ", we should be within a factor of a few of the spin - down based upper limit  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ s3sensitivity ] shows the sensitivity of the geo and ligo interferometers during the s3 run .",
    "best sensitivities of the three ligo and the geo600 interferometers during the s3 data run.,width=302 ]    in this paper we will report on some aspects of the new s3/s4 search for signals from radio pulsars . in section  [ method ] we will give a brief review of the technique used in previous and current analyses .",
    "we will provide an example of a hardware injection of a pulsar signal in the ligo interferometers during s3 in section  [ injections ] . in section  [ s3s4data ]",
    "we will show the results of statistical tests investigating the gaussianity of the frequency bands of the ligo s3/s4 data containing the radio pulsar signals . as an example",
    ", we will show preliminary results in section  [ prelim ] for a multi - detector analysis for pulsar j1939 + 2134 using ligo and geo s3 data .",
    "brief conclusions will be given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the overall pipeline for the analysis of the s3/s4 data for signals from known pulsars is very similar to the techniques used in s1 and s2 .",
    "a brief description of the method is provided here with more details available in  @xcite .",
    "the data from the interferometer are heterodyned with the known phase evolution of each pulsar and down - sampled to one data point , @xmath8 , each @xmath9th minute .",
    "these data points @xmath8 are essentially a 1/60hz band - limited time series centered on the instantaneous frequency of the gravitational wave signal at the detector .",
    "we assume that the noise floor for each band was stationary and gaussian over periods of 30 minutes . as will be shown later in section  [ s3s4data ] ,",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for a majority of the pulsars .",
    "we take a bayesian approach for the statistical analysis .",
    "we use bayes theorem to calculate the posterior probability , @xmath10 , of a set of parameters @xmath11 given the binned data , @xmath12 . for this problem ,",
    "bayes theorem states that @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the set of parameters that could produce the set of data , @xmath12 , with likelihood @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xmath14 comprises of four unknown parameters : the gravitational wave amplitude @xmath16 , the polarization angle @xmath17 , the inclination of the pulsar s spin axis with respect to the line - of - sight @xmath18 , and the initial phase of the gravitational wave signal @xmath19 .",
    "our prior beliefs in our set of parameters are reflected in the prior probability term , @xmath20 .",
    "we use the least informative priors for most of the parameters in their respective ranges : @xmath21 uniform over @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath17 uniform over @xmath23 $ ] , and @xmath18 uniform in @xmath24 over @xmath25 $ ] , corresponding to a uniform prior per unit solid angle of pulsar orientation .",
    "it can be shown that the likelihood of each 30 minute segment of data , labeled by @xmath26 , is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the signal model , @xmath8 is the are the data points , and @xmath29 is the number of data points in the segment .",
    "equation  [ likelihood ] is equivalent to a student s @xmath30-distribution with @xmath31 degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that the lengths of the stationary segments , @xmath32 , can be adjusted depending on the performance of the detectors .",
    "the joint likelihood of all the @xmath33 stretches of data , taken as independent , is therefore @xmath34",
    "we use the term _ hardware injections _ for simulated signals that make the instrument behave in the same way as if a gravitational wave signal was present . during the s3 and s4 runs ,",
    "several hardware injections were carried out that mimicked periodic signals from pulsars in the ligo interferometers .",
    "these injections provide end - to - end validations of the search codes and the data acquisition pipelines .",
    "the phase of the signals is properly modulated to simulate the doppler shift from specific directions in the sky .",
    "the signals are also amplitude modulated to reflect the antenna pattern of the interferometers .",
    "these pulsar hardware injections increase our confidence that the timing between sites is consistent .",
    "this is especially important for coherent multi - detector searches where a large lag in timing between the detectors could severely reduce the sensitivity of the search .",
    "figure  [ s3pulsar2 ] shows the marginalised probability distribution functions for @xmath16 and @xmath19 for one of the s3 pulsar injections .",
    "the recovered parameters for this example agree well with the injected signal parameters .",
    "work is currently in progress to make sure all the s3/s4 hardware injections are correctly extracted from the ligo data .",
    "there are still some unclear issues with the phase of the s4 injections but we do not expect any major problems",
    ".     recovered parameters for one of the s3 pulsar hardware injections .",
    "the dashed line represents the signal parameter injected .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "in this section we report on some statistical tests that were performed to assess the gaussianity of the s3/s4 data near the frequencies where we expect pulsar signals . for each pulsar",
    ", we examined the data in a @xmath35hz frequency band around the instantaneous gravitational wave frequency of the signal at the detector .",
    "these data are the heterodyned data set mentioned earlier .",
    "we have applied kolmogorov - smirnov ( lilliefors ) tests to assess whether contiguous segments of 30 minutes of this data are normally distributed for each pulsar .",
    "this consists of comparing the experimental cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) for each of the 30 minute data segments with a gaussian cdf .",
    "the k - s test statistic is a simple method to quantitatively measure the difference of these two distributions .    for each pulsar ,",
    "the k - s statistic was calculated for every 30 minute segment of data and compared to the lilliefors critical values  @xcite .",
    "the critical value for a sample size of 60 ( since the @xmath8 s are complex ) for a level of significance of 0.05 is @xmath36 . by definition , at a level of significance of 0.05 we would expect approximately 5% of the data to be rejected if the data was indeed normal .",
    "figure  [ ks ] shows the distribution of the fraction of 30 minute segments of data rejected for each interferometer . for the majority of the pulsars between 5 - 10% of the data",
    "were rejected .",
    "this is quite reasonable and suggests that the data is relatively well behaved for most pulsars .",
    "for a few pulsars the s4 data is significantly better modeled by a gaussian distribution than the s3 data .",
    "this is due to an improvement in the performance of the detectors in s4 .",
    "it has been shown that rejecting the non - gaussian s3 data does not significantly effect the final results  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since the non - gaussian data will have a small likelihood .",
