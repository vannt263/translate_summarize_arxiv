    "understanding the nucleus and its properties in terms of qcd is a very ambitious goal and we are still far from it .",
    "significant progress has been achieved in this direction with the use of chiral perturbation theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models have been sucessfully used to describe the bulk properties of nuclear matter , finite nuclei and dense stars @xcite .",
    "although they are only effective models , they are simple , depend only on few parameters and are the ideal tool to test certain aspects of nuclear matter .    in this work we shall use the relativistic mean field model discussed in @xcite to investigate the formation and propagation of korteveg - de vries solitons in nuclear matter .",
    "assuming that nuclear matter behaves like an ideal fluid we wish to know whether small baryon density perturbations can propagate without dissipation through the medium .",
    "if this turns out to be case , these pulses might be responsible for interesting phenomena .",
    "one of them would be the apparent nuclear transparency in proton nucleus collisions at low energies .",
    "the impinging proton would be absorbed by the fluid and turned into a density pulse .",
    "it would then be able to traverse the target nucleus emerging on the other side .",
    "this idea has been first advanced in @xcite . in @xcite the experimental evidence of this `` nuclear transparency '' was discussed .",
    "in @xcite the formalism was improved with the inclusion of viscosity and three - dimensional expansion . in @xcite",
    "the effect of the nuclear surface was considered .",
    "one important lesson from all these works is that the formation of solitons depends in a crucial way on the equation of state ( eos ) . in @xcite",
    "the equation of state employed was borrowed from @xcite and it was very phenomenological , containing no information about the microscopic nucleon dynamics .",
    "the experimental signature of the nuclear soliton is very difficult to measure , since the outcoming nucleon emerges in a direction very close to the beam .",
    "probably because of this reason the subject was left aside for almost ten years .",
    "soliton formation in nuclear matter was then revived in @xcite , where a different equation of state was considered .",
    "this eos was developed in @xcite and was based on the nucleon - nucleon microscopic interaction given by the skyrme force .",
    "the main finding of @xcite was that the nuclear soliton is not a compression pulse , as thought before .",
    "instead , it is a rarefaction pulse due to a sign inversion appearing because of the use of skyrme interactions .",
    "now , another ten years later , we come back to this subject because we feel that this beautiful idea has not been explored enough .",
    "we shall replace the eos used in the early works by another one , based on the model of @xcite .",
    "the usual relativistic mean field models do not generate equations of state which lead to solitons because they do not contain higher derivatives , required in nonlinear differential equations .",
    "therefore we will introduce a new interaction term in the lagrangian of @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section we present some simple formulas of nonrelativistic hydrodynamics and write them in terms of the baryon and energy density .",
    "this will help to establish the connection between these equations and the relativistic mean field eos .",
    "in the subsequent section we discuss the model of @xcite , introduce the new interaction term and , in the mean field approximation , derive the equation of state . in the following section , we combine the hydrodynamic equations with the new eos and derive the kdv equation and its analytical solution .",
    "the last section contains some concluding remarks .",
    "the basic equations of nonrelativistic hydrodynamics @xcite are euler equation @xmath0 and the continuity equation @xmath1 in these equations , @xmath2 is the mass density , which , in the nuclear medium , is related to the baryon density through @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the enthalpy per nucleon is given by @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the specific volume .",
    "for a perfect fluid @xmath7 the equation above becomes @xmath8 and consequently : @xmath9 inserting ( [ ro ] ) and ( [ gradpe ] ) in ( [ euler1 ] ) and in ( [ cont1 ] ) we obtain @xmath10 and @xmath11 the enthalpy per nucleon may also be written as @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy per nucleon given by : @xmath14 which inserted in ( [ entalbu ] ) leads to : @xmath15 and therefore : @xmath16 with these simple manipulations we can make explicit the dependence of euler equation ( [ eulerentalpia ] ) on @xmath17 , or in other words , on the equation of state of nuclear matter .    as it will be seen later , it is possible to perform a combination of ( [ eulerentalpia ] ) and ( [ contibari ] ) in a specific way to obtain a nonlinear differential equation for the baryon density , with soliton solutions .",
    "the existence or not of these solitons depends on the function @xmath17 .",
    "a key feature of ( [ eulerentalpia ] ) and ( [ gradh ] ) is that they contain the gradient of the derivative of the energy density .",
    "if @xmath18 contains a laplacian of @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 then equation ( [ eulerentalpia ] ) will have a cubic derivative with respect to the space coordinate , which will give rise to the korteweg - de vries equation for the density .",
    "the most popular rmf models do not have higher derivative terms and , even if they have at the start , these terms are usually neglected during the calculations . in the next section",
    "we show how to overcome these limitations and obtain a slightly more general expression for @xmath17 with laplacians .",
    "we start with the well known variant of qhd - i @xcite , employed in @xcite : @xmath21\\psi   +   { \\frac{1}{2}}\\big(\\partial_{\\mu } \\phi \\partial^{\\mu } \\phi - { m_{s}}^{2 } \\phi^{2}\\big)\\ ] ] @xmath22 where , as usual , the degrees of freedom are the baryon field @xmath23 , the neutral scalar meson field @xmath24 and the neutral vector meson field @xmath25 , with the respective couplings and masses . the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 will be taken from @xcite . as it can be seen , there are no higher order derivatives .",
    "this is the reason why the traditional qhd and most of its numerous variants do not give an equation of state compatible with soliton propagation , like ( [ epslap ] ) .",
    "for this it is necessary , in first place , to modify the lagrangian , introducing a term with laplacian derivative couplings .",
    "the simplest one is given by : @xmath28 where the subscrit @xmath29 denotes `` modification '' in qhd .",
    "first of all , this term is designed to be small in comparison with the main baryon - vector meson interaction term @xmath30 .",
    "because of the derivatives , it is of the order of : @xmath31 where the fermi momentum is @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 gev .",
    "the form chosen for @xmath34 is not dictated by any symmetry argument , has no other deep justification and is just one possible interaction term among many others @xcite .",
    "it is used here as a prototype . in the future",
    ", we plan to address this problem with a state of the art lagrangian .",
    "as it can be immediately guessed , the integration by parts of @xmath34 leads to a dalembertian acting on the baryon current .",
    "we present ( [ lagram ] ) with the derivatives acting on @xmath35 just because it can be more easily compared to @xmath30 it allows for estimates like ( [ estimate ] ) .",
    "the total lagrangian is then : @xmath36 integrating @xmath37 by parts twice , making the standard mean field approximation @xmath38 @xmath39 and neglecting the time and spatial derivatives of the fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we arrive at the approximate lagrangian @xmath42 given by : @xmath43\\psi -{\\frac{1}{2}}{m_{s}}^{2}{\\phi_{0}}^{2}+{\\frac{1}{2 } } { m_{v}}^{2}{v_{0}}^{2}\\ ] ] @xmath44v_{0 } \\label{llinhaexpli}\\ ] ] the equations of motion of the fields are : @xmath45\\psi=0 \\label{eqm1}\\ ] ] @xmath46 @xmath47 where , for simplicity , we have neglected the terms containing laplacians .",
    "this means that the perturbation changes slightly the energy of the system , but does not affect the dynamics of the environment , i.e. , of the unperturbed @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath48 fields .",
    "the energy density is calculated using the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath49 which , with the help of ( [ llinhaexpli ] ) , ( [ eqm1 ] ) , ( [ eqm2 ] ) is given by : @xmath50}^{2}+\\ ] ] @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the baryon spin - isospin degeneracy factor and @xmath54 stands for the nucleon effective mass : @xmath55 the two terms in the last line of ( [ epsilonexp ] ) come from @xmath34 .",
    "baryon number propagation in nuclear matter has been studied in @xcite with the help of the diffusion equation : @xmath56 where the diffusion constant @xmath57 was numerically evaluated as a function of density and temperature and found to be @xmath58 at densities comparable to the equilibrium nuclear density and temperatures of the order of @xmath59 mev .",
    "the exact value of @xmath57 at @xmath60 is unknown but its dependence both with temperature and density is very smooth and an extrapolation to @xmath60 points to values even smaller than @xmath61 fm .",
    "this number is small compared to any nuclear size scale and can be interpreted as indicating that density gradients do not disappear very rapidly in nucler matter . using ( [ diffusion ] )",
    "twice in the last term of ( [ epsilonexp ] ) it can be rewritten as : @xmath62 \\label{sectimederi}\\ ] ] which , in the context of the present calculation , can be neglected because @xmath63 . with this last approximation , the final form of the energy density",
    "is given by ( [ epsilonexp ] ) without the last term .",
    "the baryon density up to the fermi level @xmath64 is given by : @xmath65 as usual , the nucleon effective mass is determined by the minimization of @xmath66 with respect to @xmath67 , which results in the self - consistency relation : @xmath68 @xmath69\\ ] ]    the main result of this section is ( [ epsilonexp ] ) , which , in what follows , will be used in the derivation of the kdv equation . by keeping @xmath70 ( but not @xmath71 )",
    "we take into account the small inhomogeneities , which do not change rapidly in time ( and therefore we neglect @xmath72 ) . whereas this approximation is quite often used at the nuclear surface , it is not very common for the bulk of nuclear matter .",
    "we believe , however , that it is quite reasonable .",
    "in this section we follow the treatment developed in @xcite and @xcite to obtain the korteweg - de vries equation in one dimension by the combination of ( [ eulerentalpia ] ) and ( [ contibari ] ) .    expression ( [ epsilonexp ] ) is valid for any @xmath19 . in order to make contact with the nuclear matter phenomenology and",
    "use the constraints imposed by the saturation curve , we will now use ( [ epsilonexp ] ) to compute the energy per baryon @xmath13 ( [ epb ] ) .",
    "we then taylor expand it around the equilibrium density @xmath73 up to second order : @xmath74 where the first order term vanishes because of the saturation condition @xmath75 the derivative coefficient in ( [ energypernucleon ] ) may be rewritten as @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath4 is the nucleon mass and @xmath77 is the speed of sound in nuclear matter . calculating the enthalpy per nucleon ( [ entalbu ] ) by using ( [ energypernucleon ] ) leads to : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80}^{2 } + { \\frac{\\gamma}{(2\\pi)^{3}}}\\int_{0}^{k_{f } } d^3{k } ( { \\vec{k}}^{2}+{m^{*}}^{2})^{1/2 } + \\ ] ] @xmath81 where the integration limit @xmath82 ( which appears also in @xmath83 ) is fixed at the value corresponding to @xmath73 . inserting ( [ entalpypernucleon ] ) in ( [ eulerentalpia ] ) we arrive at : @xmath84\\ ] ] @xmath85 we now repeat the steps developed in @xcite and @xcite , write ( [ eulerfinal ] ) and ( [ contibari ] ) in one space dimension ( @xmath86 ) and introduce dimensionless variables for the density and velocity : @xmath87 and @xmath88 we next define the `` stretched coordinates '' @xmath89 and @xmath90 as in @xcite : @xmath91 and @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a size scale and @xmath94 is a small ( @xmath95 ) expansion parameter chosen to be @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the propagation speed of the perturbation .",
    "after these tedious but straightforward substitutions , we expand ( [ rochapeu ] ) and ( [ vchapeu ] ) around their equilibrium values : @xmath98 @xmath99 equations ( [ eulerfinal ] ) and ( [ contibari ] ) will contain power series in @xmath94 up to @xmath100 . since the coefficients in these series are independent we get a set of equations , which , when combined , lead to the kdv equation for @xmath101 @xmath102 which has a well known soliton solution .",
    "we may rewrite the above equation back in the @xmath103 space obtaining a kdv - like equation for @xmath104 with the following solitonic solution : @xmath105   \\label{solchapeu}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 .",
    "the solution above is a bump with width @xmath107 given by : @xmath108 since @xmath109 and since @xmath110 we can see that @xmath104 is always smaller than one and is consistent with the expansion ( [ roexp ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ ucs ] ) implies that @xmath111 .",
    "this upper bound is arbitrary , being a consequence of the choice ( [ sigma ] ) , but it must exist . as mentioned in the introduction , the perturbation of the medium may be caused by the passage of a nucleon projectile and we expect that for higher projectile energies the modification of medium will be so strong that our perturbative approach will break down .",
    "the upper bound in the pulse velocity implies a limit for the momentum of the incident nucleon given by : @xmath112    as it can be seen from ( [ width ] ) , the soliton width depends on parameters of the microscopic dynamics , as the coupling and mass which come from the lagrangian ( [ ltotal ] ) .",
    "the sound velocity comes from the eos derived from the same lagrangian .",
    "the expression ( [ width ] ) also reveals the supersonic nature of this phenomenon , since it is only possible for @xmath113 .",
    "in the case where the density pulse is caused by a nucleon traversing a nucleus , if the width is comparable to the nucleon size and much smaller than the nuclear radius , the pulse will be localized and the impinging nucleon may emerge from the nucleus . if , on the other hand , @xmath107 is large , of the order of the nuclear radius , then the incident energy will most likely be absorbed by the nucleus as a whole , which will undergo some collective excitation and decay .    in the numerical evaluation of ( [ width ] )",
    "we need to know the values of the parameters appearing in the lagrangians ( [ lagratotal ] ) and ( [ lagram ] ) . for @xmath114",
    "we consider both the original qhd - i , without the nonlinear terms , just as a reference , and the most phenomenologically successful model of @xcite , with its different parameter choices labeled by @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the use of the original qhd - i equation of state in hydrodynamical calculations leads to a too rapidly expanding system , as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "all the input numbers as well as the calculated incompressibilities @xmath119 , equilibrium densities @xmath120 , nucleon effective masses @xmath54 and sound velocities @xmath121 are shown in table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to observe that the maximal momentum @xmath122 depends on @xmath121 and therefore will be different for different models .",
    "choosing values for @xmath97 , from @xmath121 to @xmath123 , and computing both @xmath107 and @xmath124 up to @xmath122 for the different models , we obtain the curves shown in fig .",
    "as it can be seen , the width decreases with the projectile energy , as anticipated in @xcite .",
    "we can also see that , the stiffer is the equation of state , the wider is the window for soliton formation . at bombarding energies of a few hundred mev the collisions are",
    "probably too violent and the departure from the initial equilibrium state is too large for the soliton picture to be true . at energies smaller than @xmath125 mev ,",
    "the width starts to be larger but still significantly smaller than the nuclear radius .",
    "moreover , the choice of @xmath126 in ( [ lagram ] ) was just a first guess .",
    "the derivative coupling could be different and much weaker , leading to narrower solitons .",
    "as it appears now in ( [ width ] ) @xmath107 is directly proportional to @xmath126 .",
    "if the coupling would be half of the value used here , even the softest eos ( @xmath115 ) would lead to narrow solitons .",
    "after having established the connection between kdv solitons and relativistic mean field models , we can test other theories and other derivative couplings .",
    "the observation of kdv solitons in nucleon - nucleus collisions was also discussed in @xcite , considering the exisiting experimental results at that time .",
    "nowadays much more data are available and it might be interesting to look at them with the soliton picture in mind , searching for some unexpected transparency .",
    "assuming that rmf models give a satisfactory description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei and , also , that the nucleus can be treated as a perfect fluid , we have investigated the possibility of formation and propagation of korteweg - de vries solitons in nuclear matter .",
    "we have updated the early estimates of the soliton properties , using more reliable equations of state . in doing",
    "so we had to introduce in the lagrangian a term with derivative coupling between the baryon and the vector meson fields .",
    "the term used here was the simplest one and with it we could already find kdv solitons , which have their properties ( in particular the width ) controled by the microscopic parameters of the underlying theory , such as masses and couplings . whereas the quantitative results are not entirely conclusive , they suggest that kdv may indeed exist in nuclear matter .",
    "it is fair to say that the subject deserves further investigation .",
    "finally we would like to mention that , during the last decade , due to the cern - sps and rhic programs , hydrodynamics has experienced a great revival @xcite and supersonic phenomena @xcite were also brought back to explain recent rhic data .",
    "nonlinear effects , as those discussed here , may be relevant also in this context .",
