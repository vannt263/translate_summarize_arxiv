    "understanding the infrared behavior of gauge theories from first principles is a longstanding problem that offers perhaps the best hope of eventually understanding all the mysteries of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is well known that an important class of gauge invariant correlation functions in the qcd vacuum is constructed from field strengths and wilson lines .",
    "these correlators do play an important role in several areas of qcd including models of stochastic confinement of color , high energy scattering , heavy quarkonium systems , etc .",
    "the simplest field strength correlator in four - dimensional euclidean space is defined by    @xmath0\\,\\rangle      \\,.\\ ] ]    here @xmath1 are the euclidean coordinates , the trace is over the fundamental representation , @xmath2 is a field strength of the gauge field @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a path - ordered wilson line .",
    "the last is defined as @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is a parameter of the path running from @xmath7 at @xmath8 to @xmath9 at @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a gauge coupling constant .",
    "the paths are defined as straight lines .",
    "if one considers not a field strength but a field with different color quantum numbers , then the construction of correlators is changed .",
    "for instance , a field transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group will produce a two - point correlator    @xmath12    with @xmath13 the field in the fundamental representation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 its conjugate .",
    "in general , there are many possible generalizations of the correlators by choosing different ( curved ) contours for the wilson lines , or by inserting operators along the contours .",
    "it is believed that for large separation of the field strength operators the two - point correlator falls off exponentially @xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a kinematical factor , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a correlation length .",
    "this is the case also for @xmath20 , in fact    @xmath21    with a correlation length @xmath22 .    until recently ,",
    "the lattice formulation , still struggling with limitations and system errors , was the main computational tools to deal with non - weakly coupled gauge theories .",
    "the field strength correlators were also intensively studied ( for a brief review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the situation changed drastically with the invention of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite that resumed interest in another tool , string theory .",
    "the original duality was for conformal theories , but various perturbations ( deformations ) produce gauge / string duals with a mass gap , confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , etc @xcite .",
    "in this note we continue a series of recent studies devoted to a search for an effective string description of pure gauge theories . in @xcite ,",
    "the model was presented for computing the heavy quark potential at zero temperature .",
    "subsequent comparison @xcite with the available lattice data has made it clear that the model should be taken seriously . a non - trivial cross check for this model @xcite , which checked the phenomenological value of the gluon condensate @xcite , was also carried out .",
    "later , the model was extended to finite temperature .",
    "the results obtained for the spatial string tension @xcite and the expectation value of the renormalized polyakov loop @xcite in the deconfined phase are remarkably consistent with the lattice , too .",
    "as is known , qcd is a very rich theory supposed to describe the whole spectrum of strong interaction phenomena .",
    "the question naturally arises : how well does such an effective string description capture other aspects of quenched qcd ? here , we address the issue of computing the field strength correlators in an _ analytical _ way as an important step toward answering this question .    before proceeding to the detailed analysis ,",
    "let us set the basic framework .",
    "as in @xcite , we take the following ansatz for the five - dimensional background geometry    @xmath23    to describe a pure gauge theory at zero temperature .",
    "the metric is that of a deformed @xmath24 space , where @xmath25 is a deformation parameter whose value can be fixed , for example , from the heavy quark potential .",
    "we take a constant dilaton and discard other background fields .",
    "when we go to the deconfined phase , we consider the five - dimensional geometry of @xcite    @xmath26    which represents a deformed schwarzschild black hole in @xmath24 space . here",
    "@xmath27 is related to the hawking temperature @xmath28 whose dual description is nothing but the temperature of gauge theory .",
    "to begin with , we need to find a recipe for computing the field strength correlators within the gauge / string duality .",
    "the strategy for finding it is as follows . in discussing the wilson loops @xcite , one first chooses a contor @xmath29 on a four - manifold which is the boundary of a five - dimensional manifold .",
    "next , one has to study fundamental strings on this manifold such that the string world - sheet has @xmath29 as its boundary .",
    "the expectation value of the wilson loop is schematically given by the world - sheet path integral @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes a set of world - sheet fields and @xmath32 is a world - sheet action . in principle , the integral can be evaluated approximately in terms of minimal surfaces that obey the boundary conditions .",
    "the result is written as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 means a renormalized minimal area ( in string units ) whose weight is @xmath35 .         in the case of a rectangular wilson loop living on the boundary ( @xmath36 ) of five - dimensional space a minimal surface corresponding to a static string cofiguration",
    "is sewn together from three surfaces , as shown in figure 1 ( left ) . for large @xmath37",
    ", we have @xcite    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a ground state energy of a quark - antiquark bound state and @xmath40 is a renormalized area of the end - surface shown in figure 1 ( right ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the temporal gauge the expectation value of the wilson loop can be evaluated as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the gauge hamiltonian in the temporal gauge and @xmath43 is the quark - antiquark bound state .",
    "it is given by @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "since the quarks are non - dynamic , we need to normal order only the @xmath46-exponential function that results in non - zero expectation value for the normal ordered operator .",
    "note that the exponential fall off is consistent with the fact that @xmath43 is normalizable .",
    "then combining this with , we find    @xmath47    where @xmath40 is a renormalized area of the surface shown in figure 1 ( right ) .",
    "note that this formula is valid only for the ground state .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar representation has been suggested in @xcite for the expectation value of the polyakov loop . in this case",
    "there is no need for the quark sources .",
    "the string is prevented from getting deep into @xmath48 direction by a black hole geometry such that the maximum value of @xmath48 is bounded by the black hole horizon . in the model with dynamic quarks it appeared in @xcite .",
    "a difference here is that the wilson loop goes along an internal direction . in general , it is natural to expect that in the presence of dynamic quarks the representation breaks down at large separations due to string breaking .",
    "physically , this means that quark bound states decay .    to write a formal expression for the field strength correlator ,",
    "let us think of the wilson lines as forming a long , narrow rectangular loop in the @xmath49-@xmath50 plane , as shown in figure 1 ( left ) but with small @xmath37 .",
    "the field strength operators are set at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the exponential fall off for large @xmath53 is due to the wilson loop expectation value .",
    "subleading corrections come from quadratic fluctuations in the world - sheet path integral and from the field strength operators .",
    "they are expected to give a polynomial prefactor @xmath54 in front of the exponential . taking the limit @xmath55",
    ", we have    @xmath56    where @xmath40 is the same renormalized area as in .",
    "note that this formula only provides the leading exponent in the large @xmath53 limit .    in analyzing the formulas and ,",
    "an interesting relation arises .",
    "since @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath53 , we find that the correlation lengths @xmath22 and @xmath19 are related as    @xmath57    given the background metric , we can calculate the renormalized area @xmath40 by using the exact shape of the static string stretched between the heavy quark sources @xcite . with the large @xmath53 behavior in mind ,",
    "it is technically suitable to add two pieces , shown in dashed lines in figure 1 ( right ) , to the original surface .",
    "their areas are each of subleading order in @xmath58 . as a result",
    ", the surface of interest becomes a rectangular in the @xmath49-@xmath48 plane .",
    "now we are ready to use the nambu - goto action equipped with the background metric    @xmath59    next , we choose @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this yields    @xmath62    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we have also rescaled @xmath48 as @xmath65 .",
    "since the integral is divergent at @xmath66 due to the @xmath67 factor in the metric , we have to regularize it .",
    "we do so by imposing a cutoff @xmath68 .    to next - to - leading order in @xmath68 , the integral is given by    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the imaginary error function .",
    "we use the modified minimal subtraction scheme to deal with this integral .",
    "so , we subtract the power divergence @xmath71 together with a constant @xmath72 whose value must be specified from renormalization conditions . as a result , the renormalized area takes the form can be absorbed into @xmath72 .",
    "however , it becomes temperature - dependent at finite temperature ( as we will see in section 3 ) , so we keep it . ]",
    "@xmath73    combining this with and , we get the correlation length @xmath22    @xmath74    it is now clear that @xmath37 must go to zero faster than @xmath68 . indeed , in the limit @xmath75 the contribution of the lateral surface vanishes and , as a consequence , the relation holds . with this fact understood",
    ", it is now straightforward to find the correlation length @xmath19    @xmath76    to define the model properly , we must specify the renormalization conditions .",
    "in doing so , we start with the correlation length @xmath22 .",
    "our stringy construction suggests a natural condition @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the string tension . in the model we are considering it",
    "is given by @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "making an estimate requires some numerics .",
    "for @xmath80 a value of @xmath81 fixed from the heavy quark potential is @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath83 .",
    "a typical value of @xmath25 is @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "if so , a value of @xmath19 is estimated to be @xmath85 is it a reasonable value ?",
    "although the lattice calculations of @xcite claim a slightly bigger value @xmath86 but with an error of order @xmath87 , there is an obvious troublesome question . if the calculations are made in two different renormalization schemes , why are the results so similar ?",
    "unfortunately , we have no real resolution of this problem .",
    "on the other hand , choosing @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the mass of the lightest glueball @xcite , gives @xmath90 .",
    "a simple algebra shows that in this case @xmath91 .",
    "according to @xcite , at finite temperature we must separately consider the electric and magnetic correlators @xcite .",
    "so , we decompose @xmath2 into the electric and magnetic fields : @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is expected @xcite that at large separations the magnetic correlators show exponential fall off for any temperature , while the electric ones do so just below the critical temperature @xmath94 .    to study the magnetic correlator @xmath95\\,\\rangle$ ] ,",
    "we take the wilson lines in the @xmath49-@xmath96 plane and regard @xmath29 as a long , narrow rectangle similar to that of figure 1 ( with @xmath50 replaced by @xmath96 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath29 is now a spatial wilson loop .",
    "a crucial difference from temporal wilson loops is that in the deconfined phase spatial ones obey an area law , with a spatial string tension @xmath97 .",
    "is not a physical string tension because it is not related to the properties of a physical potential . ] in other words , a ( spatial ) string stretched between two well - separated sources does nt break .",
    "this allows us to use a formalism similar to that of section 2 .",
    "so , the exponential fall off for large @xmath53 is due to the spatial wilson loop expectation value .",
    "the magnetic field operators and world - sheet fluctuations contribute to a polynomial prefactor @xmath46 in front of the exponential . taking the @xmath55 limit ,",
    "we find    @xmath98    where @xmath40 is a renormalized area of the surface shown in figure 1 ( right ) .    repeating the arguments of section 2 , we add two pieces to the original surface to simplify further calculations .",
    "the nambu - gotto action , which we wrote before as , is now    @xmath99    where the background metric @xmath100 is given by . using the gauge @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "it becomes    @xmath101    here we have rescaled @xmath48 as @xmath102 .",
    "as in section 2 , we regularize the integral over @xmath103 by imposing a cutoff @xmath68 .",
    "note that in the deconfined phase the large distance physics is determined by the near horizon geometry of the deformed schwarzschild black hole in @xmath24 space @xcite .",
    "so , the upper limit is @xmath27 .    to next - to - leading order in @xmath68 ,",
    "the integral is given by    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the generalized hypergeometric function and @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "we use again the modified minimal subtraction scheme and look for a renormalized area .",
    "so , we have    @xmath108      \\,.\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath75 the contribution of the lateral surface is negligible . as a result , the correlation length is given by    @xmath109^{-1 }      \\,.\\ ] ]    to complete the picture , we must impose the renormalization conditions .",
    "let us try @xmath110 .",
    "the reason for this is that at zero temperature it is equivalent to @xmath77 because the spatial string tension remains constant below @xmath106 , where it coincides with the ( physical ) string tension . in the model we are considering the temperature - dependence of the spatial string tension for @xmath111",
    "is given by @xcite    @xmath112    where @xmath78 is the string tension .",
    "note that it is in a good agreement with the lattice data up to @xmath113 .",
    "a little experimentation with mathematica soon shows that the expression , looking somewhat awkward , provides a very similar temperature dependence as the simpler expression . in figure 2",
    "we have plotted the results .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath114    with the previous value @xmath83 .",
    "it is remarkable that for @xmath115 the maximum discrepancy is of order @xmath116 .    to study the electric field correlator @xmath117\\,\\rangle$ ] , we take the wilson lines in the @xmath49-@xmath50 plane and regard them as forming a long , narrow rectangle shown in figure 1 . in the deconfined phase a static string stretched between two well - separated sources breaks . as a result",
    ", the dominant surface is given by a sum of two disconnected surfaces @xcite whose renormalized areas vanish in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "this shows that in the deconfined phase there is no exponential fall off behavior of the electric field correlators at large distances .",
    "such a conclusion looks attractive because it agrees with that of lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) we would like to emphasize again that the field strength correlators are scheme and path dependent .",
    "the former is due to a linear divergency of expectation values of wilson loops .",
    "it is known as the perimeter law .",
    "the latter becomes clear if we let @xmath29 be a circular loop of radius @xmath118 .",
    "this leads to @xmath119 rather than @xmath120 at large @xmath53 .",
    "note that when a value of @xmath121 is finite , the contribution of the lateral surface is no longer negligible .",
    "it matters for @xmath19 in .",
    "\\(ii ) it is a common wisdom that magnetic and electric correlators are related to spatial and temporal wilson loops , respectively .",
    "we have followed this philosophy in section 3 with our proposal for the two - point correlators .            thus , our model predicts the scheme - independent relation between the correlation lengths of magnetic operators at different temperatures . it will be interesting to see whether it will match or close to match lattice simulations .",
    "\\(iv ) if we consider not a field strength but an arbitrary local operator in the adjoint representation of @xmath14 , then it follows from our proposal that the correlator shows the exponential fall off        this work was supported in part by dfg within the emmy - noether - program under grant no.ha 3448/3 - 1 and the alexander von humboldt foundation under grant no.phys0167 .",
