    "the structure is in general called a nuclear halo , since the spatial extension is much larger than radii of ordinary nuclei @xcite .",
    "the essence of theoretical descriptions is contained in a schematic model for two short - range interacting point - like particles as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "thresholds for binding nuclear clusters enhance the probability for finding decoupled and spatially extended nuclear structures .",
    "driplines related to different nucleons or bound clusters of nucleons provide the best environment for the corresponding ground state structures .",
    "the features of such nucleon dripline nuclei are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "nucleons can be arranged in bound clusters and thereby form the constituents for novel nuclear few - body structures as reviewed in @xcite .    increasing the number of clusters",
    "progressively reduces the possibility of large spatial extension when all particles are distinctly separated .",
    "an effective centrifugal barrier confines the mean square radius for a bound system , and overlapping nuclei of finite size would couple intrinsic and relative degrees of freedom . to prevent this collapse into one much larger many - body system",
    ", the particles may correlate strongly into clusters and effectively reduce the active degrees of freedom corresponding to much fewer well - separated clusters of particles @xcite .",
    "already four particles with infinitesimally small binding energy have finite root - mean - square radius , in sharp contrast to diverging radii of two- and three - body systems approaching zero binding energy @xcite .",
    "the repulsive centrifugal barrier combined with a short - range attraction of given radius may leave an attractive pocket able to hold a bound state .",
    "this prevents occurrence of nuclear halos of large relative angular momenta .",
    "the same mechanism opposes halos where the coulomb repulsion dominates or contributes significantly .",
    "thus , nuclear halos are most likely to occur for very small binding energy , two- and three - body systems , relative @xmath5 and @xmath6-waves , and small pairwise charge products @xcite .",
    "two - body halos should then be searched for at their threshold for binding while still subject to these conditions , both for ground and excited states .",
    "three - body cluster states are probably less frequent and potentially less pronounced than two - body halos .",
    "however , investigations of occurrence and properties are essentially all confined to light nuclei . for ground states",
    "the most promising structures appear to be for borromean systems , since the unbound two - body subsystems are prohibited from reducing the active degrees of freedom to an effective two - body system .",
    "then the conditions are positive pairwise cluster binding and very small three - body binding .",
    "the most obvious constituents are neutrons , protons , and @xmath0-particles .",
    "heavier particles necessarily have both larger radii and charges , and therefore less obvious constituents in a halo system",
    ".    pairs of identical nucleons and @xmath0-particles are always unbound , and the borromean properties are therefore determined by the pairwise binding energies to the third particle @xcite .",
    "the positive binding of nucleon - core and a core-@xmath0 systems dictate the position in the nuclear chart to be around the corresponding driplines .",
    "as we shall discuss later , combining nucleons and @xmath0-particles is then not possible for neutrons while the proton dripline is suitable for nuclei with neutron number @xmath7 .",
    "we shall not deal with the individual light nuclei where the borromean properties are thoroughly discussed in the available literature @xcite .",
    "two @xmath0-particles and a heavier core along the @xmath0-dripline can form a borromean system .",
    "we shall in the present paper concentrate on two @xmath0-particles plus a medium heavy core - nucleus which is a system so far very little discussed .",
    "the borromean property is established experimentally for a few nuclei @xcite as pointed out recently @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether @xmath0-particles in the end turn out to be substantially contributing constituents to the structure of some low - energy states in medium heavy nuclei .",
    "the minimum requirement is that the intrinsic @xmath0-particle degrees of freedom effectively decouple from all other nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "recent theoretical investigations of large systems confirm the expectation that @xmath0-particles are advantageous for nuclear matter densities corresponding to the tail of a nucleus @xcite .",
    "explicit use of @xmath0-particle degrees - of - freedom is complementary to mean - field approximations , where correlations only appear through shell structures of single nucleons ( or pairs ) in deformed average fields .",
    "such models provide completely different basis states , but they are not necessarily unable to describe the same features of some many - body states . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that octupole deformation has been an important ingredient in descriptions of nuclei located close to the @xmath0-dripline @xcite , where @xmath0-clustering is most likely to occur in ground states .",
    "we assume @xmath0-particles as the basic constituents with the inherent limits of validity that only very specific structures can be described .",
    "however , it may very well be states that can not be described in mean - field or shell - models , or at most only with severe difficulties indicating that an inappropriate basis is chosen .",
    "the @xmath0-clusterization , or more moderately @xmath0-correlations , should produce an otherwise larger binding energy which then simply could be measured as the revealing observable .",
    "the increased binding has to be compared to the surrounding nuclei , and the signal would be contained in appropriate mass differences @xcite .",
    "this would be in complete analogy to the odd - even staggering related to the `` pairing gaps '' @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such a signal in the variation of the binding energy between neighbouring nuclei is extremely difficult to separate from the smooth background variation which therefore necessarily has to be eliminated .",
    "the optimistic point of view would be that @xmath0-correlations are more extended and vary smoothly over smaller or larger regions of the nuclear chart .    instead of futile searching for signals in the binding energies @xcite ,",
    "we shall therefore directly calculate three - body properties from an assumption of the presence of two @xmath0-particles surrounding a heavier core - nucleus .",
    "we are then able to study the solutions , test compatibility with the assumptions , and predict the properties of the emerging structures . we first in sec .",

    "[ sec con ] contains a summary and the conclusions .",
    "borromean systems are , almost by definition , most often weakly bound , since all three two - body subsystems must be unbound and the same interactions are responsible for the three - body binding .",
    "this definition is appropriate for ground states of systems where the cluster division already is made .",
    "the total system may very well have much deeper - lying bound states of different structures where the cluster division is completely inadequate .",
    "thus the structures of interest here can appear as relatively highly excited states of the given nucleus .",
    "it is only within the decided cluster structures that the corresponding three - body system is relatively weakly bound compared to the threshold of large - distance separation of all three clusters .",
    "the weak cluster - binding is compatible with large size and with cluster identities maintained .",
    "therefore , the most likely region for finding three - body cluster states should be where the effective cluster - cluster interaction provides small , positive or negative , binding energies .",
    "cluster driplines are then useful in outlining regions where corresponding borromean systems should be more likely .",
    "let us now focus on two @xmath0-particles surrounding a core - nucleus .",
    "we want to find the @xmath0-dripline with vanishing @xmath0-separation energy , @xmath11 , that is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the nuclear binding energy , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are neutron and proton numbers , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the binding energy of an @xmath0 particle .",
    "the dripline defined by @xmath19 can be estimated by use of the liquid drop model , or specifically @xmath20 where we use the parameter values @xcite : @xmath21 , all in mev .",
    "then @xmath19 combined with eqs .",

    "( [ drip0 ] ) are combined with @xmath24 and @xmath25 to give the proton and neutron numbers of the @xmath0-dripline boundaries for any nucleon number @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , it would be possible to derive expressions for both neutron and proton driplines .    , neutron , and proton driplines in the chart of nuclei , where nuclei with a negative separation energy have been marked in a corresponding colour .",
    "marked in green are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath8 , which represents nuclei of interest in the @xmath0-dripline region .",
    "[ fig nucl ] ]    the results are shown in the nuclear chart in fig .",
    "[ fig nucl ] , where nuclei with experimentally known negative neutron , proton , or @xmath0-separation energies are marked .",
    "the computed curves are in overall agreement with the measured results , which is to be expected since the liquid drop parameters are adjusted to achieve this goal .",
    "the negative neutron and proton binding energies are outside the corresponding driplines . on the other hand",
    ", the negative @xmath0-bindings occur between the legs of the two solutions as emphasized by the many known @xmath0-unstable heavy nuclei marked in red .",
    "if an isotope is marginally on the unstable side of a dripline , it can rather likely form a borromean system by adding two identical particles ( neutrons , protons , or @xmath0 s ) to the corresponding core - nucleus .",
    "this is often observed for neutrons , but the repulsive coulomb interaction may sometimes invalidate this expectation for protons and @xmath0-particles .",
    "thus , these nuclei are promising candidates for ground state cases of borromean two-@xmath0 systems .",
    "it is perhaps worth emphasizing that going away from the @xmath0-driplines into either @xmath0-unbound or @xmath0-bound nuclei would correspond to @xmath0-core ground state structures of negative or positive binding energy , respectively .",
    "then the red nuclei , between the legs of the @xmath0-dripline curves , should be simulated by a positive @xmath0-core energy even for the ground state .",
    "vice versa , outside the region this two - body energy should be negative , and excited states of two - body energy just above zero are the strong candidates for the @xmath0-cluster states we are going to investigate .",
    "in other words , both positive and negative two - body energies are worth investigating , both as ground states and as excited states .    from fig .",
    "[ fig nucl ] we can also deduce which mixed species of nucleons and @xmath0-particles are most promising in connection with formation of borromean states and the related @xmath0-clusterization .",
    "first we notice that the neutron - proton - core system is excluded as a borromean state due to the bound deuteron .",
    "borromean states involving nucleons in general only occur for ground states close to the corresponding nucleon driplines .",
    "this excludes neutron-@xmath0-core systems since the neutron and @xmath0 driplines never intersect or come close to each other . when the neutron - core is unbound the @xmath0-core system is bound .",
    "in contrast , proton-@xmath0-core systems are possible borromean systems along the proton dripline for systems heavier than about @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "this is especially promising in the region where proton and @xmath0 driplines intersect each other as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig nucl ] .",
    "these structures are interesting and should be investigated in details in the future .",
    "it would involve both proton - core and @xmath0-core effective two - body interactions . at present",
    "we only emphasize that this experimentally accessible region probably would present a series of such borromean systems .",
    "in addition , we notice that similar cluster structures may appear as excited states in lighter nuclear systems .",
    "the three - body calculations require two - body potentials between the three pairs of particles . for @xmath0-@xmath0-core systems",
    "we only need to specify the @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-core potentials .",
    "we treat all particles as point - like and the finite sizes must then be accounted for through effective potentials .",
    "this also implies that the actual choice of potentials is less important .",
    "we can use the energy as the crucial parameter and measure lengths relative to the radius of the core - nucleus .",
    "conclusions from individual test cases are then more general .",
    "after definitions of the two - body potential we define notation and principal quantities in a brief sketch of the three - body method .",
    "first we choose the @xmath0-@xmath0 potential as the @xmath31-version of the ali - bodmer potential @xcite as used previously in many applications @xcite .",
    "this potential is angular momentum dependent without bound states while reproducing the low - energy phase shifts very well .",
    "the measured energy , @xmath32  mev , is reproduced , and the root - mean - square radius of the corresponding resonance is calculated to be @xmath33 .    the second potential between @xmath0-particle and core must necessarily be phenomenologically adjusted . at the @xmath0-dripline",
    "the binding energy has to be vanishingly small , but not necessarily of the lowest state . in the present work the antisymmetry between nucleons in the core and in the @xmath0-particles",
    "are only accounted for by use of a shallow effective @xmath0-core potential or by exclusion of the deepest - lying bound states .",
    "thus , the pauli principle is approximately obeyed by occupying only states with very small binding energy . as shown in @xcite , where the halo nuclei @xmath34he and @xmath4li are investigated , for weakly bound systems a shallow potential and a deep potential holding pauli forbidden states",
    "give rise to similar three - body structures provided that both potentials have the same low - energy properties .",
    "we assume the intrinsic core - spin is zero and the total angular momentum is then exclusively from the orbital part .",
    "this implies that the potential is central and the decisive ingredient is the radial shape with corresponding size and strength .",
    "the natural choice for medium - heavy nuclei is the woods - saxon potential , @xmath35 , with a constant central value and exponential fall off at larger radii , that is @xmath36 where we use the diffuseness , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39  fm , @xmath40  fm , @xmath41  fm .",
    "for @xmath42 we arrive at @xmath43  fm which shall be used throughout this paper .",
    "the remaining parameter is the strength , @xmath44 , which is tuned to give the desired energies for any choice of angular momentum and parity .",
    "the coulomb potential is for a homogeneous sharp cut - off distribution of core - charge , @xmath45 and @xmath0-charge @xmath46 , with the resulting cut off radius , @xmath47  fm .",
    "this somewhat increased radius accounts for the finite sizes of both core and @xmath0-particle when a point - particle in a potential is assumed .    .",
    "[ fig 2p pot ] ]    the variation of angular momentum allows us to investigate the influence of non - vanishing partial waves on the total three - body structure .",
    "it also allows comparison between ground and excited states of both the same and different angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "excited states from the present effective potential may be unavoidable when deeper - lying levels are occupied and pauli - forbidden",
    ". the effect of changing the angular momentum can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig 2p pot ] , where the potential depth in each case is adjusted to produce the same energy .",

    "the narrow distribution is a direct consequence of the potentials in fig .",
    "[ fig 2p pot ] , where the @xmath0-particle is confined by two very steep barriers on both sides of the minimum .",
    "it is especially worth noting that the coulomb interaction for @xmath5-waves is finite at @xmath49 as obtained by a homogeneous charge distribution within a sphere .",
    "the finite repulsion is still sufficient to push the wave function out to the surface almost precisely as for finite angular momenta with the additional diverging short - range repulsion .",

    ", the low - energy spectrum of @xmath81 is reproduced by the present three - body model as well as by comparable light cluster models . both the measured and the calculated spectrum is neither rotational nor vibrational in character . however , the charge radius and the quadrupole transition probabilities are reproduced surprisingly well .",
    "the structure of states can be described as two @xmath0 particles just outside the surface of the core , and located either just over @xmath187 apart ( possibly as a @xmath1 ) , or at opposite sides of the core in an almost linear chain .",
    "we discuss the possibility of finding borromean nuclear systems with heavy constituents .",
    "crudely speaking , two two - body systems each with @xmath237 ( squared charge over mass numbers ) do not bind , that is such pairs have negative binding energy .",
    "they are then potential candidates for constituents in a borromean system .",
    "however , this is impossible as a third nucleus first would have to be similarly heavy in order not to bind , and second its addition should produce a bound three - body system . therefore it is hard to avoid light nucleons or @xmath0-particles but they can still be combined with one heavy core - nucleus .",
    "we sketch the driplines for nucleons and @xmath0-particles , and conclude that it is only possible to form a borromean system with one medium heavy nucleus by combining with two @xmath0-particles , two protons , or one proton and one @xmath0-particle . in the present investigation we focus on two @xmath0-particles and a medium heavy core - nucleus .",
    "an @xmath0-@xmath0 effective potential is chosen to reproduce all low - energy scattering properties .",
    "the @xmath0-core effective potential is chosen in the same spirit to reproduce only the weakest bound two - body states .",
    "if the energy is zero this nucleus is at the @xmath0-dripline , and a positive binding energy could allow more bound states where the weakest bound , or slightly unbound , is appropriate as @xmath0-cluster structure in an excited state .",
    "these states may be appropriate when the lower - lying @xmath0-core states are forbidden by the pauli principle due to the same nucleonic constituents in both core and @xmath0-particle .",
    "the core plus two-@xmath0 calculations are carried out by use of the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method of the faddeev equations .",
    "the total angular momentum does not have to be zero and the contributing individual partial waves can as well be finite .",
    "therefore we find bound state solutions for a few relatively small angular momentum values .",
    "the adiabatic potentials are all remarkably similar with the same minimum and barrier positions .",
    "they are repulsively diverging at small distances , then steeply increasing from the intermediate minimum towards larger distances , and finally they decrease as coulomb interactions at very large distance .",
    "the different adiabatic potentials are about @xmath95  mev apart from each other at the minimum , and their curvatures correspond to a zero point energy of several mev .",
    "the @xmath0-core potential is chosen to allow four three - body bound states with energies varying from about @xmath238  mev up to almost zero for each angular momentum .",
    "each bound state is dominated at the level of more than @xmath123 by one potential term .",
    "this means that the angular structure of each bound state is directly related to one adiabatic potential .",
    "still , their partial wave decompositions are much more complicated , but with @xmath5-waves as clearly dominating @xmath0-@xmath0 structures for the lowest bound state for all angular momenta .",
    "the second lowest state is dominated by the reverse ( with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) compared to the lowest state .",
    "the two highest - lying bound states in contrast contain large fractions of @xmath0-@xmath0 @xmath31-waves .",
    "this might indicate that the @xmath0-@xmath0 system changes relative structure from ground to first excited state of @xmath142be .",
    "however , their distance is too large for the attractive interaction to contribute , and this structure therefore has to be attributed to angular momentum and parity conservation .    the spatial distributions of @xmath0-particles around the core for the different bound states are revealing .",
    "the first striking result is that the probability distributions as a function of @xmath0-core distances in all states are located in rather narrow distributions at distances corresponding to @xmath0-particles at the surface of the core .",
    "this is in contrast to the much more varying @xmath0-@xmath0 distance distributions .",
    "the lowest bound states for all angular momenta show a spatial @xmath0-@xmath0 distribution similar to the @xmath142be structure , but with a slightly smaller average distance .",
    "however , the higher - lying bound states clearly contain several configurations , where the largest component often resembles a linear structure with the core between the two @xmath0 particles . in these excited states",
    "an @xmath142be - like structure is present but the other components are usually dominating and the total probability distribution is much more smeared out than for the two lowest bound states .",
    "measurable quantities like the energies should contain information of @xmath0-correlations . however , this is exceedingly difficult to extract from the background of all other effects contributing to the total energies .",
    "we therefore focused on @xmath0-cluster structures resulting from strong @xmath0-correlations .",
    "these structures can be detected by scattering experiments where @xmath0-particle dripline nuclei are the most obvious targets . large cross sections for two-@xmath0 removal can be expected as measured in @xcite . in more details ,",
    "an @xmath142be structure should emerge from the lowest of our three - body bound states , and two non - interacting @xmath0-particles can be expected from the three higher - lying of the four computed three - body states . measuring the transition matrix elements between different states",
    "will also constitute a test of the model .    to compare in more details with measured quantities we followed the standard procedure in few - body nuclear physics .",
    "we focused on the even - even borromean two-@xmath0 nucleus , @xmath2ba , where removal of two @xmath0-particles leave the fairly inert core nucleus , @xmath86te .",
    "for each partial wave we construct effective potentials adjusted to reproduce the @xmath0-core , @xmath172xe , two - body resonances . with these potentials we calculated three - body energies and found a very good agreement with the lowest states in the known @xmath2ba spectrum , although the spectrum was shifted slightly most likely due to the fact that pure three body effects were not accounted for explicitly .",
    "the radial structure showed that the @xmath0 particles were placed on the surface of the core .",
    "the relative angular momentum between the @xmath0 particles was dominated by @xmath5-waves .",
    "in addition , both the electric quadrupole transition probabilities and the charge radius were reproduced rather well .",
    "based on these finding we predict that the corresponding structures of these low - lying states are two @xmath0-particles in a @xmath142be configuration rotating with different angular momenta at the surface of a sphere around the @xmath86te - core .",
    "this system is the most promising for exhibiting @xmath0 clusterization in the ground state .    in summary",
    ", we investigated the structures of two @xmath0-particles surrounding a heavy core - nucleus in a three - body model .",
    "the assumptions are that @xmath0-clusters can be found with significant probability in such nuclei .",
    "we expect the most promising places in the nuclear chart are at the @xmath0 dripline where borromean two-@xmath0 structures are experimentally established by mass measurements .",
    "these nuclei should have relatively large sizes in their ground states when the energies are close to zero .",
    "this is the single most important feature characterizing spatially extended halo structures , which simultaneously enhance the possibility for decoupling of core and @xmath0-particle degrees of freedom .",
    "these three - body structures may also appear in excited states of nuclei where the @xmath0-particle is bound .",
    "then the @xmath0 and core degrees of freedom may be mixed in the ground states but decoupled in the excited state close to the @xmath0-threshold .",
    "we have shown that borromean two-@xmath0 structures are possible at the @xmath0 dripline .",
    "the @xmath0-particles at the surface of the core - nucleus would produce rotational spectra with the corresponding simple transition probabilities .",
    "strongly enhanced @xmath0-removal cross sections would also be a signal .",
