    "a scale - free network is a large graph with power law degree distribution , i.e. , @xmath0 \\sim k^{-\\gamma}$ ] where @xmath1 is a fixed positive constant .",
    "equivalently , the probability of finding a vertex of degree @xmath2 , decays as a power - law of the degree value .",
    "power - law distributed networks are of noticeable interest because they have been frequently observed in very different fields such as the world wide web , business networks , neuroscience , genetics , economics , etc . the current research on scale - free networks",
    "is mainly focused in three aspects : first , generation models ( see @xcite ) , second , solid evidence detection of networks with power - law degree distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the third and final aspect studies the extent to which the power - law distribution relates with other structural properties of the network , such as self - organization ( see @xcite ) ; this is subject of intense debate , see @xcite for a comprehensive survey on the matter .",
    "the present work studies scale - free networks from a very different perspective .",
    "its main goal is to introduce a homogenization process on the network , aimed reduce the original order of complexity but preserving the essential features ( see _ figure _ [ fig networks ] ) . in this way ,",
    "the  homogenized \" or  upscaled \" network is reliable for data analysis while , at the same time , involves lower computational costs and lower numerical instability .",
    "additionally , the homogenization process derives a neater and more structural picture of the starting network since unnecessary complexity is replaced by the average asymptotic behavior of large data .",
    "the phenomenon known as  the aggregation problem \" in economics is an example of how this type of reasoning is implicitly applied in modeling the global behavior of large networks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "usually , homogenization techniques require some assumptions of periodicity of the singularities or the coefficients of the system ( see @xcite ) , in turn this case demands averaging hypotheses in the cesro sense .",
    "the resulting network has the desired features because of two characteristic properties of scale - free networks .",
    "on one hand , they resemble star - like graphs ( see @xcite ) , on the other hand , they have a  communication kernel \" carrying most of the network traffic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this paper , for the sake of clarity , restricts the analysis to the asymptotic behavior of diffusion processes on stared metric graphs ( see _ definition _ [ def metric graph ] and _ figure _ [ fig graphs stages five and n ] below ) .",
    "however , while most of the models in the preexistent literature are concerned with the strong forms of differential equations ( see @xcite for a general survey and @xcite for the stochastic modeling of advection - diffusion on networks ) , here we use the variational formulation approach , which is a very useful tool for upscaling analysis .",
    "more specifically , we introduce the the pseudo - discrete analogous of the classical stationary diffusion problem @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the diffusion coefficient ( see _ definition _ [ def strong problem on graphs ] and _ equation _ below ) . due to the variational formulation it will be possible to attain a - priori estimates for a sequence of solutions , an asymptotic variational form of the problem and the computation of effective coefficients .",
    "finally , from the technique , it will be clear how to apply the method to scale - free metric networks in general .    throughout the exposition the terms  homogenized \"",
    ",  upscaled \" and  averaged \" have the same meaning and we use them indistinctly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in _ section _ [ sec preliminaries ] the necessary background is introduced for @xmath5 , @xmath6-type spaces on metric graphs as well as the strong form and the weak variational form , together with its well - posedness analysis . also a quick review of equidistributed sequences and weyl",

    "b.   experiments for random variations of the examples above were also executed , under the hypothesis that random variables were subject to the law of large numbers .",
    "convergence , slower than its corresponding deterministic version was observed , as expected .",
    "this is important for its applicability to upscaling networks derived from game theory , see @xcite .",
    "the present work yields several accomplishments and also limitations as we point out below .",
    "a.   the method presented in this paper can be easily extended to general scale - free networks in a very simple way .",
    "first identify the communication kernel ( see @xcite ) .",
    "second , for each node in the kernel , replace its numerous incident low - degree nodes by the upscaled nodes together with the homogenized diffusion coefficients and forcing terms , see _ figure _ [ fig networks ] . b.   the particular scale - free network treated in the paper i.e. , the star metric graph , arises naturally in some important examples .",
    "these come from the theory of the strategic network formation , where the agents choose their connections following utilitarian behavior . under certain conditions for the benefit - cost relation affecting the actors when",
    "establishing links with other agents , the asymptotic network is star - shaped ( see @xcite ) .",
    "c.   the scale - free networks are frequent in many real world examples as already mentioned .",
    "it follows that the method is applicable to a wide range of cases .",
    "however , important networks can not be treated the same way for homogenization , even if they share some important properties of communication .",
    "the small - world networks constitute an example since they are highly clustered , this feature contradicts the power - law degree distribution hypothesis .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed exposition on the matter .",
    "d.   the upscaling of the diffusion phenomenon is done in a hybrid fashion . on one hand ,",
    "the diffusion on the low - degree nodes is modeled by the weak variational form of the differential operators defined over the graph , but ignoring its combinatorial structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the diffusion on the communication kernel will still depend on both , the differential operators and the combinatorial structure .",
    "this is an important achievement , because it is consistent with the nature of available data for the analysis of real world networks . typically , the data for central ( or highly connected ) agents are more reliable than data for marginal ( or low degree ) agents .",
    "e.   the central cesro convergence hypotheses for data behavior ( stated in _ lemma _",
    "[ th estimates on v_0 = 0]-(iii ) , as well as those contained in _ hypothesis _ [ hyp forcing term cesaro means assumptions ] , in order to conclude convergence have probabilistic - statistical nature .",
    "this is one of the main accomplishments of the work , because the hypotheses are mild and adjust to realistic scenarios ; unlike strong hypotheses of topological nature such as periodicity , continuity , differentiability or even riemann - integrability of the forcing terms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this fact is further illustrated in _",
    "example _ [ ex .",
    "non - riemann integrable forcing terms ] , where good asymptotic behavior is observed for a forcing term which is nowhere continuous on the domain @xmath55 of analysis .",
    "f.   an important and desirable consequence of the data hypotheses adopted , is that the method can be extended to more general scenarios , as mentioned in _ remark _ [ rem probabilistic flexibilities ] , reported in _ subsection _ [ sec numerical closing observations ] and illustrated in _",
    "examples _ [ ex .",
    "probabilistic flexibilities ] , [ ex . unbounded example ] and [ ex . unbounded frequency ] .",
    "moreover , _ example _",
    "[ ex . unbounded frequency ] suggests a probabilistic upscaled model for the communication kernel , to be explored in future work .",
    "g.   a different line of future research consists in the analysis of the same phenomenon , but using the mixed - mixed variational formulation introduced in @xcite instead of the direct one used in the present analysis .",
    "the key motivation in doing so , is that the mixed - mixed formulation is capable of modeling more general exchange conditions than those handled by the direct variational formulation and by the classic mixed formulations .",
    "this advantage can broaden in a significant way the spectrum of real - world networks which can be successfully modeled and upscaled .",
    "h.   finally , the preexistent literature typically analyses the asymptotic behavior of diffusion in complex networks , starting from fully discrete models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pseudo - discrete treatment that we have followed here , constitutes more a complementary than an alternative approach . depending on the availability of data and/or sampling , as well as the scale of interest for a particular problem , it is natural to consider a  blending \" of both techniques .",
