    "<S> the steady state velocity fluctuations of a movable piston located on the top of a vibrated granular gas are studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations . from the second moment of the distribution , a temperature parameter for the piston </S>",
    "<S> is defined and compared with the granular temperature of the gas located just below it . </S>",
    "<S> then the two temperature parameters refer to two interacting macroscopic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the equipartition of energy valid in usual molecular systems is strongly violated , and the temperature of the piston can be larger or smaller than the one of the gas , depending of the parameters defining the system at the particle level . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results for the ratio of temperatures are in agreement with some theoretical predictions from kinetic theory assuming the validity of a hydrodynamic description in the limit of weak inelasticity of the gas .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : granular matter , kinetic theory of gases and liquids , fluctuations ( theory )    one of the characteristic features exhibited by granular fluids is the violation of the energy equipartition theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the granular temperatures of each of the components of a mixture , defined from the average kinetic energies of the particles , are not the same . </S>",
    "<S> this was pointed out long ago @xcite , and has attracted a lot of attention in the last decade or so . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the equality of the temperatures of the components of a mixture of molecular fluids is not restricted to equilibrium thermal systems , but also applies to out - of - equilibrium situations , at least to those that can be described by means of usual hydrodynamics as derived from kinetic theory or non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .    for the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) of a binary granular mixture modeled as an ensemble of smooth inelastic hard spheres </S>",
    "<S> , the ratio of temperatures of the two components has been obtained from an approximated solution of the kinetic enskog equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in good agreement with molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hcs is an idealized state in which the system cools homogeneously and monotonically . in real experiments , to maintain a granular system fluidized , external energy must be continuously supplied , and this is achieved by means of vibrating or rotating walls , by shearing , by shaking , or by other external fields . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the systems become inhomogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> the non - equipartition has been confirmed by md simulations of simple shear flows @xcite , and of vibrated gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are also some experimental evidences of the coexistence of different component temperatures in strongly vibrated granular mixtures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> homogeneously driven granular fluids submitted to stochastic forces have also been considered . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of energy equipartition in these systems has been analyzed @xcite , but the relationship between this kind of ideal driving and actual experiments is uncertain .    </S>",
    "<S> a peculiarity of the above studies is that they are concerned with quantities going beyond the macroscopic description , in the sense that the relevant macroscopic local property is the global temperature ( or energy density ) of the mixture , and not that of each of the components . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the latter are rather difficult to measure experimentally . here , a possible experimental set - up in which the breakdown of energy equipartition is macroscopically observed is described and studied by means of md and kinetic theory . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment is specifically designed to be reproducible in the laboratory , and might have some practical advantages over previous related experiments @xcite , although it must be stressed that the study reported here is restricted to low density gases and that no friction between the particles , of the particles with the piston , or of the latter with the walls of the container is taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a granular system composed of @xmath0 inelastic hard spheres ( @xmath1 ) or disks ( @xmath2 ) of mass @xmath3 and diameter @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> there is an external gravitational field acting on the system , so that each particle is submitted to a force @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a positive constant and @xmath7 the unit vector in the direction of the positive @xmath8 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the system is kept fluidized by vibrating the lower wall of the container in a sawtooth way , with very high frequency , negligible amplitude , and velocity @xmath9 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter will be always taken large enough as to keep the density of the system small everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> on the top of the system there is a movable lid or piston of mass @xmath10 , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the piston can only move in the @xmath8-direction , remaining always perpendicular to it . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that there is no friction between the piston and the lateral walls of the vessel containing the granular gas .        </S>",
    "<S> collisions between particles are inelastic and characterized by a constant coefficient of normal restitution @xmath11 , so that when a pair of particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 collides , their relative velocity @xmath14 changes instantaneously according with @xmath15 while the total momentum is conserved . in the above expression </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath16 is a unit vector directed from the center of particle @xmath13 to the center of particle @xmath12 at contact . </S>",
    "<S> collisions of particles with the piston are also modeled as smooth and inelastic , being @xmath17 the coefficient of restitution in this case . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account that the piston can only move in the @xmath8 direction , the change in the relative velocity in a collision is restricted to the @xmath8-component , and it is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the velocity of the piston . </S>",
    "<S> this relation and the total momentum conservation define the collisions with the piston .    </S>",
    "<S> next , some results from md simulations of two - dimensional systems will be presented . to avoid undesired effects , </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions are used in the direction perpendicular to the external field . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that , at least when the width @xmath20 of the system is not too large , a steady state with no macroscopic flow of mass , and gradients in the fluid only in the direction of the external field , i.e. the @xmath8 axis , is reached after some transitory period . </S>",
    "<S> this state is independent from the value of @xmath20 , as long as it is kept small enough . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the hydrodynamic profiles in the bulk will be analyzed elsewhere @xcite , while here the emphasis will be put on the relationship between the temperature parameters of the piston , @xmath21 , and of the gas in its vicinity , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> both temperatures are defined from the second moment of the respective velocity distributions , namely @xmath23 , @xmath24 , with the angular brackets denoting average . in the results to be reported in </S>",
    "<S> the following , units defined by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 will be used .    </S>",
    "<S> the measured probability distribution for the velocity of the piston is very well fitted by a gaussian in all the cases considered . a typical example </S>",
    "<S> , corresponding to @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . for this case </S>",
    "<S> , the value @xmath34 is found . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the gaussian fit is accurate at least up to values of the probability density of the order of @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of @xmath22 is somewhat more problematic , since the ` top region ' of the granular gas next to the piston has to be identified . here </S>",
    "<S> , the layer of the gas defined by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the dispersion of the values of the position of the piston @xmath38 , has been used </S>",
    "<S> . then , the average over the velocities to compute @xmath22 has been carried out over the particles inside this region at each time . </S>",
    "<S> this criterium may appear as rather arbitrary , but it has been checked that other sensible choices , such as extrapolating the bulk temperature profile to @xmath39 , lead to values of the temperature with discrepancies of the order of @xmath40 . in this way , it is found that @xmath41 , implying @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this represents a strong violation of the energy equipartition , specially taking into account that the collisions between the grains and the piston have been modeled as elastic ( @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it must be stressed that the temperature parameter of the piston is larger than the temperature of the gas transmitting to it the effects of the lower vibrating wall . </S>",
    "<S> it can be wondered whether this effect is related with some strong anisotropy of the velocity distribution of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> let us define @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> . then , for the particular case we are discussing , it is found that @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although there is some anisotropy as usual in vibrated granular systems , it is very weak as compared with the excess value of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , it is @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the same trend is observed in all the other cases investigated , being the above the one in which the anisotropy of the second moment of the velocity tensor is stronger .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , the temperature ratio @xmath48 is plotted as a function of the coefficient of restitution of the gas @xmath11 for three different values of the pair ( @xmath10 , @xmath17 ) , illustrating the influence of each of these parameters on the temperature ratio . quite interestingly , the violation of equipartition ( deviation of the temperature ratio from unity ) is not a monotonic function of @xmath11 , but the temperature ratio exhibits a minimum in the small inelasticity region . the result with @xmath50 , @xmath30 , has been obtained with a non - vibrated system at thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , equipartition is recovered in the limit @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason to restrict the analysis to the inelasticity region @xmath52 is that , for smaller values , even the hydrodynamic description of the bulk of the gas , as provided by the navier - stokes equations , breaks down @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an expression for the temperature ratio can be derived as follows . </S>",
    "<S> given the low density of the gas , a pair of coupled boltzmann and boltzmann - lorentz kinetic equations are used as the starting point to describe both the gas and the piston . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent calculations are based on the following two assumptions : ( a ) the macroscopic state of the piston can be specified in terms of the hydrodynamic fields of the gas in its vicinity and its position probability distribution , and ( b ) the associated normal solution of the kinetic equations can be generated by the chapman - enskog procedure . with these hypothesis , </S>",
    "<S> it is obtained that the zeroth order in the gradients cooling rates of the piston , @xmath53 and of the top region of the gas , @xmath54 , must be the same @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these rates are functionals of the one - particle distributions for the top region of the fluid and the piston . given that these distributions are not known , maxwellians can be used as an estimation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , no anisotropy effects are introduced in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> a generalization of the derivation in @xcite , with the peculiarity that now all the the collision vectors have the same direction , leads to @xcite @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the gas density in the top region , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 note that all the dependence on the mass ratio and the inelasticity @xmath17 occurs through @xmath61 . requiring the cooling rates to be the same , an equation determining @xmath62 is obtained , @xmath63 the elastic collisions limit ( @xmath64 ) is given by @xmath65 , that is the equipartition result . </S>",
    "<S> if the particle collisions are elastic but not those with the piston ( @xmath66 ) , it is @xmath67 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result is the same as the one derived in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an inelastic intruder in an equilibrium elastic gas .    the prediction made by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 6 ] ) is compared with some md simulation results in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , where @xmath62 is plotted as a function of @xmath61 . in the simulations , the values of the latter quantity have been modified by changing both @xmath10 ( in the range @xmath68-@xmath69 ) and @xmath17 ( between @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath72 , and @xmath0 ) are kept the same as in fig . . </S>",
    "<S> the symbols are the simulation results while the lines are from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 6 ] ) , as indicated . data for two values of @xmath11 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , are reported . </S>",
    "<S> for the most elastic gas , the agreement is quite good , for all the considered values of the other parameters . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , when the inelasticity of the gas is slightly increased , strong deviations from the theoretical prediction show up . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies are not only quantitative , but also qualitative . </S>",
    "<S> the circled symbols on the left lower corner of the figure correspond all them to @xmath31 , differing in the value of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that when @xmath17 ( and @xmath61 ) increases , @xmath62 decreases , in contradiction with the solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 6 ] ) . to identify the cause of the failure of the theory , </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the marginal distribution of the component of the velocity of the grains perpendicular to the piston in the top region , @xmath75 , has been measured . </S>",
    "<S> while for @xmath76 it is always well fitted by a gaussian within the numerical error of the simulations , for @xmath77 , exponential tails are clearly identified for positive velocities already in the thermal range , as it is seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these tails are relevant for the lowest velocity moments of the gas . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it was already mentioned above ( see fig . ) that the velocity distribution of the piston remains gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical analysis of the existence of this exponential tail probably requires going beyond the chapman - enskog method , the restriction to normal solutions of the boltzmann equation and , therefore , of the hydrodynamic description .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results seem to provide additional evidence of the difficulties when trying to give a macroscopic meaning to the granular temperature , at least as defined in kinetic theory and the usual hydrodynamic theories . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the hydrodynamic profiles of the confined gas and the characteristics of the interactions between the gas particles and the piston is not enough to determine the `` temperature '' of the latter . </S>",
    "<S> more detailed information about the velocity distribution of the gas in its vicinity is required . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is surprising that sometimes the `` temperature '' of the body to which energy is supplied ( the piston ) be larger than the temperature of the system supplying the energy ( the neighbor gas ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results also show that this effect is not associated to the anisotropy of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us stress the differences of this system as compared with a gas mixture , even in the tracer ( one - intruder ) limit . here </S>",
    "<S> , two macroscopic systems spatially differentiated are interacting at contact , their respective states being strongly interdependent . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , it seems clear that both temperature parameters have a macroscopic meaning .    </S>",
