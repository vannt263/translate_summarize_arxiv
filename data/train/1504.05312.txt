    "compact objects , such as black holes ( bhs ) and neutron stars are identified by electromagnetic radiations emitted from the accreting disk formed by matter from their companion .",
    "this matter is accreted either through roche - lobe overflow or winds .",
    "some of these objects are transient stellar mass x - ray binaries with a low mass star acting as a donor star .",
    "study of these objects in x - rays is very interesting as they undergo rapid evolution in their timing and spectral properties which are strongly correlated to each other .",
    "there are a large number of articles by several groups ( see , e.g. , mcclintock & remillard , 2006 ; belloni et al .",
    "2005 ; nandi et al . 2012 ; debnath et al .",
    "2013 , etc . ) which discuss variation of spectral and temporal properties of these transient black hole candidates ( bhcs ) during their x - ray outbursts .",
    "in general , it has been found that these objects show different spectral states ( hard , hard - intermediate , soft - intermediate , soft , etc . ;",
    "mcclintock & remillard , 2006 ) and low and high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in power - density spectra ( pds ) in some of these spectral states ( remillard & mcclintock , 2006 ) .",
    "different branches of x - ray color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams ( hids ; maccarone & coppi , 2003 ; belloni et al .",
    "2005 ; debnath et al .",
    "2008 , etc . )",
    "are related to different spectral states of the outburst phases .",
    "it has also been observed by several authors ( see , mandal & chakrabarti , 2010 ; nandi et al . , 2012 ;",
    "debnath et al . , 2013 and references therein ) that these observed spectral states show hysteresis loops during their spectral evolutions of an entire epoch of the outburst of these transient bhcs .",
    "simple model fits of accretion rates using two component advective flow ( tcaf ) solution of    chakrabarti - titarchuk ( 1995 , hereafter ct95 ) by mandal and chakrabarti ( 2010 ) indicated that indeed the accretion rates vary differently in the rising and declining states .    in the literature ,",
    "there are a large number of theoretical or phenomenological models , which describe accretion flow dynamics around a bh .",
    "it is well known that emitted radiation contains both thermal and non - thermal components .",
    "the thermal component is multi - color blackbody type emitted the standard keplerian disk ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ; novikov & thorne , 1973 ) and the other is a power - law component , originated from the so - called ` compton ' cloud ( sunyaev & titarchuk , 1980 ; 1985 ) .",
    "this component is composed of hot electrons and is cooled down by repeated compton scatterings of the low energy ( soft ) photons .",
    "there are many speculations about the nature of this compton cloud which range from it being a magnetic corona ( galeev , rosner & viana , 1979 ) to a hot gas corona over the disk ( haardt & maraschi , 1991 ; zdziarski et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "ct95 , in their tcaf solution , considers that the centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer or cenbol plays the role of the compton cloud .",
    "this cenbol happens to be the post - shock region of the low - angular momentum halo in which a standard keplerian disk remains immersed while emitting soft photons .",
    "the shock in the halo forms due to the piling up of matter behind the centrifugal barrier of the low angular momentum accretion flow component having a sub - critical viscosity parameter ( chakrabarti 1990ab , hereafter c90ab , 1996 ) .",
    "these shocks are found to be stable even under non - axisymmetric perturbations ( okuda , teresi & molteni , 2007 ) .",
    "the other component of tcaf is an optically thick standard ( ss73 ) keplerian ( disk ) component which is formed in flows with super - critical viscosity parameter ( c90ab ) . of course , this disk also has to pass through the inner sonic point to satisfy the boundary conditions on the black hole horizon ( c90ab ; see also , muchotrzeb & paczyski , 1982 ) .",
    "formation of tcaf from a single simulation ( see , giri & chakrabarti , 2013 ; giri , garain & chakrabarti , 2015 , and references therein ) show that it has a stable configuration . also , in mondal et al .",
    "( 2014a ) a self - consistent transonic solution of tcaf in presence of both cooling and outflows is obtained .",
    "recently , after the inclusion of this tcaf solution ( ct95 ; chakrabarti , 1997 , hereafter c97 ) in heasarc s spectral analysis software package xspec as an additive table model debnath , chakrabarti & mondal ( 2014 , hereafter dcm14 ) , debnath , mondal & chakrabarti ( 2015 , hereafter dmc15 ) and mondal , debnath & chakrabarti ( 2014b , hereafter mdc14 ) obtained a clearer picture about the accretion flow dynamics around bhcs as they find evidences of systematically varying accretion rates of the standard disk and the halo and the shock location on a daily basis . from the tcaf fitted spectrum ,",
    "one can obtain two accretion rates ( disk and halo ) , shock locations and shock strength .",
    "these parameters also give us information about the frequency of qpos .",
    "transitions of various spectral states which are observed during the outburst phases of a transient bhc can be identified by special behaviour of accretion rate ratio ( arr ) and the nature of observed qpos .",

    "5 of van der horst et al . 2013 ) of those specific days showed significant error bars and thus it is uncertain if soft states were reached .",
    "it is also possible that the inclination angle might also have played a role in hardening the spectra ( as discussed in another source by motta et al .",

    "although low frequency ( @xmath73  hz ) qpos are observed almost three decades ago , there is a debate on the origin of this temporal behavior in fourier transformed power - density spectrum of the x - ray intensity variation . according to shock oscillation model ( som ) of chakrabarti and his collaborators in mid-90s ,",
    "it can occur when compton cooling time scale roughly agrees with infall time scale ( molteni , sponholtz & chakrabarti , 1996 ) or due to non - satisfaction of rankine - hugoniot conditions to form a stable shock ( ryu , chakrabarti & molteni , 1997 ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations of garain et al .",
    "( 2014 ) also demonstrated this in presence of comptonization .",
    "according to som , the qpo frequency is inversely proportional to the infall time ( @xmath74 ) in the post - shock region .",
    "it also has been observed that these qpo frequencies show monotonically increasing ( during rising phase of the outburst ) or decreasing ( during declining phase of the outburst ) nature in hard and hard - intermediate spectral states .",
    "this evolution of the qpo frequencies can be well fitted with the pos model , which is nothing but time varying form of the som .",
    "movement of the shock inward could be due to rapid cooling and consequent collapse of the cenbol ( in the rising phase ) and outward , due to the lack of cooling in the declining phase ( mondal , chakrabarti & debnath , 2015 ) .",
    "in soft - intermediate spectral states , sporadic qpos are observed , which may be due to appearance or disappearance of the oscillating component , namely , cenbol by intrusion of strong toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "strong sporadic jets are also seen in these states ( e.g. , nandi , et al .",
    "2001 ; radhika & nandi 2014 ) .",
    "our current tcaf model takes care of the combined effects of cenbol and the outflow .",
    "separation of the effects of cenbol and jets is possible from more detailed modeling of timing properties and will be incorporated in a later version of tcaf .",
    "recently , it has been shown ( dmc15 , mdc14 ) using examples of 2010 - 11 outburst of galactic bhc gx 339 - 4 and 2010 outburst of galactic bhc h  1743 - 322 how spectral state transitions may be triggered when the relative ratio of the accretion rates , namely , arr , vary in specific ways . the nature of variation of qpos ( when observed ) , shock locations , strengths etc .",
    "are also very specifically .",
    "exactly same type of variation of the fitted parameters are also seen for the current source maxi  j1659 - 152 . from the observed variation of keplerian rates in these objects , we believe that an outburst is triggered due to a sudden rise in viscosity and is turned off due to the reduction in viscosity ( ct95 , ebisawa , et al .",
    "1996 ; chakrabarti , dutta & pal , 2009 ) .",
    "it is possible that this object belongs to a category , with short orbital period , where accretion disk around the black hole is mostly dominated by the wind accretion compared to disk accretion .",
    "the keplerian disk is always immersed inside a strong sub - keplerian halo .",
    "so , the soft state may be difficult to achieve . in future",
    ", we will make detailed spectral and temporal study of other such objects ( for e.g. , xte  j1118 + 480 of orbital period @xmath75  hrs , gonzlez - hernndez et al . 2013 ; swift  j1753.5 - 0127 of orbital period @xmath76  hrs , zurita et al .",
    "2007 ) during their x - ray outbursts to check if flow dynamics of these sources also follow a similar trend .",
    "prediction of qpo frequency from tcaf solution fitted shock parameters ( @xmath31 & @xmath35 ; dcm14 ) , and comparative study with pos model solution will be published elsewhere .",

    "<S> we make a detailed study of the evolution of accretion flow dynamics during its 2010 outburst through spectral analysis using the chakrabarti - titarchuk two - component advective flow ( tcaf ) model as an additive table model in xspec . </S>",
    "<S> accretion flow parameters ( keplerian disk and sub - keplerian halo rates , shock location and shock strength ) are extracted from our spectral fits with tcaf . </S>",
    "<S> we studied variations of these fit parameters during the entire outburst as it passed through three spectral classes : _ hard , hard - intermediate , _ and _ soft - intermediate_. we compared our tcaf fitted results with standard combined disk black body ( dbb ) and power - law ( pl ) model fitted results and found that variations of disk rate with dbb flux and halo rate with pl flux are generally similar in nature . there appears to be an absence of the soft state unlike what is seen in other similar sources . </S>"
