    "since the existence of the adiabatic geometric phase that was first revealed in pioneer work of berry @xcite , the concepts of geometric phases have been extensively generalized along many directions @xcite , and now the applications of geometric phases can be found in various physical fields @xcite .",
    "recently , the close relation between geometric phases and quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) has been revealed gradually @xcite and increasing interest has been drawn to the role of geometric phases in detecting qpts for various many - body systems @xcite . essentially , quantum phase transitions happened at zero temperature are characterized by the dramatic changes in the ground - state properties of a many - body system . unlike classical phase transitions driven by thermal fluctuations , qpts are driven by pure quantum fluctuations .",
    "traditionally , qpts are analyzed by resorting to notions such as the order parameter and symmetry breaking within the landau - ginzburg paradigm , however , this scheme can not give a complete description of properties of the ground state in many - body systems .",
    "in the past few years , a lot of efforts have been devoted to the study of qpts from other perspectives , such as quantum order or topological order @xcite , entanglement measures @xcite , and quantum fidelity based on the concept of quantum information sun , zanardiprl , chenshu , gu08 . generally ,",
    "in the vicinity of qpts , the changes in the ground state driven by external parameters of the hamiltonian will lead to an energy - level crossing or avoided energy - level crossing between the ground state and the excited state @xcite , and the features of level structures can be captured by the geometric phase of the ground state because the features of energy - levels crossing or avoided crossing correspond to the divergence or extremum property of the berry curvature . from the geometrical perspective ,",
    "the geometric phase is a reflection of the global curvature in the parameter space of the hamiltonian .    in the present work",
    ", we shall use the geometric phase of ground state to detect the qpts for a period - two inhomogeneous anisotropic @xmath0 spin-@xmath2 chain in a transverse field , in which the nearest - neighbor interactions and the degree of anisotropy will take alternating parameters between the neighbor sites @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the previous studies of geometric phase as a witness of qpts mainly concerned homogeneous spin chains for simplicity carollo , zhu , hamma . on the other hand , inhomogeneous systems will exhibit rich phase diagrams and it would be interesting to investigate whether the geometric phase is able to characterize the quantum phase transition in these more complicate systems .",
    "so far , many methods have been introduced to investigate the inhomogeneous spin chains in different limited conditions @xcite ; however an explicit expression of the ground state , which is necessary for the derivation of the geometric phase , is still lacking . in our scheme , by mapping the spin hamiltonian on a fermionic system through the jordan - wigner transformation and the fourier transformation , we derive a general canonical transformation to realize the diagonalization of the fermionic system hamiltonian coupled in the @xmath1- space and construct the exact expression of the ground state .",
    "our results show that there exist more than one critical points at some parameter region and the critical points correspond to the divergence or extremum property of the berry curvature of the hamiltonian parameter space .",
    "the system under consideration is an inhomogeneous periodic anisotropic @xmath0 spin-@xmath3 chain @xcite , which consists of @xmath4 cells with two sites in each cell , and in an external magnetic field .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 ,   \\label{spinham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 are the local spin operators , @xmath7 is the exchange coupling , @xmath8 is the anisotropy in the in - plane interaction on the @xmath9 site in the @xmath10th cell and @xmath11 is the external field .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions and choose @xmath4 to be odd for convenience .",
    "this model encompasses a group of other well - known spin models as its special cases @xcite , such as quantum ising model in a transverse field for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the transverse field @xmath14 model for @xmath15 and @xmath13 , and the uniform transverse field anisotropic @xmath0 model for @xmath16 and @xmath13 .    in order to obtain the geometric phase in this system , we consider rotating this model by applying a rotation of angle @xmath17 about the @xmath18 axis to each spin @xcite , i.e. , @xmath19 $ ] , and then we have @xmath20 , in which @xmath21 is the relevant rotation operator and we have set @xmath22 for simplicity .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is @xmath25 periodic in @xmath17 because the quadratic form about the @xmath26 and @xmath27 axes appears symmetric in eq .",
    "( [ spinham ] ) . considering the unitarity of the rotation operator @xmath28 ,",
    "the critical behavior and energy spectrum of the family of hamiltonians parametrized by @xmath17 are obviously @xmath17 independent .",

    "thus the boundary conditions on the fermionic system are @xmath39 , and the fermionic system will obey periodic or antiperiodic conditions depending on whether @xmath38 is even or odd @xcite .",
    "however , the differences between the two boundary conditions are negligible in the thermodynamic limit where the second - order qpts occur @xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", we assume the periodic boundary condition on the fermionic system , which means that @xmath38 is always even and @xmath40 .",
    "this periodic boundary condition enables us to introduce a fourier transformation , @xmath41to the hamiltonian @xmath42 , in which @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is defined as the coordinate of site @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) on the @xmath10th cell in the one - dimensional lattice with the lattice parameter @xmath49 .",

    "we note that the hamiltonian @xmath51 can be expressed as @xmath52 with matrix @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a @xmath55 hermitian matrix .",
    "therefore , we can always find a unitary transformation matrix @xmath56 which can be inserted in the hamiltonian as @xmath57 and then transform the matrix @xmath54 into a diagonal matrix @xmath58 .",
    "that is to say , the term @xmath59 is equivalent to introducing the following canonical transformation and define a set of new operators , i.e. , @xmath60where @xmath61and @xmath62using the set of quasiparticle operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we can write the hamiltonian @xmath51 in the explicit diagonal form as @xmath65where @xmath66 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath54 , and now , they are the relevant quasiparticle energy spectrums as follows : @xmath67furthermore , it can be verified that the general canonical transformation eq .",
    "( [ cantran ] ) can be reduced to the familiar bogoliubov transformation in the case of the uniform anisotropic @xmath0 model .",
    "now , let us focus on the geometric phase of the ground state .",
    "we have introduced the family of hamiltonians parameterized by @xmath68 , and this family of hamiltonians @xmath69 can be described as a result of adiabatic rotation of the physical system .",
    "the geometric phase of the ground state will be accumulated when the system finish a cyclic evolution , corresponding to varying the angle @xmath68 from 0 to @xmath70 [ @xmath71 is @xmath70 periodic in @xmath68 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath51 in eq .",

    "a notable feature is that the divergence of the curve in the thermodynamic limit only exists in the parameter region of @xmath143 and @xmath117 , which correspond to the case of the uniform quantum ising model , while in the other parameters regions , the curves only show extremum points .    in fig.2",
    ", we illustrate the derivative of the geometric phase of the ground state in various cases of inhomogeneous periodic systems .",
    "an interesting thing is that there may exist two quantum phase transition points in some parameter regions for the inhomogeneous period - two systems .",
    "the number of transition points and the corresponding divergence or extremum properties of curves are dependent on the parameters of the hamiltonian , which is quite different from those of the quantum ising model and anisotropic @xmath0 model in a transverse field @xcite . as shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(c ) , the derivatives of the geometric phase only display the extremum instead of the divergence properties even under the thermodynamic limit condition . on the other hand , in figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(d ) , the extremum and divergence properties can coexist in some parameter regions . in order to further understand the divergence or extremum property of @xmath144 ,",
    "we choose a section of fig .",

    "3 , in which the hamiltonian parameter takes @xmath116 , @xmath132 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in this case , the transition point of qpt is characterized by the extremum point .    as shown in fig .",
    "3 , there is no real divergence even in the thermodynamic limit but it tends to two extremum points with the increasing of the lattice size @xmath4 .",
    "the transition points in the thermodynamic limit can also be obtained by the finite - size analysis of positions of extremum points for different size systems .",
    "our results show that the position of the first extremum point approaches the first qpt point @xmath147 in a way of @xmath148 with the transition point @xmath149 and the second one approaches as @xmath150 with the transition point @xmath151 .",
    "as shown above , the geometry phase can be used as a detector for the more complicated qpts in the inhomogeneous system .",
    "this is because there exists an intrinsic connection between the geometric phase and the energy - level structure .",
    "furthermore , similar connection is also reflected in the fidelity .",
    "the relation between the fidelity and berry phase has been unveiled in terms of geometric tensors @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic relationship between the fidelity and the characterization of qpts has also been studied in ref .",
    "for a general hamiltonian of the quantum many - body system undergoing qpts given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is supposed to be the driving term with @xmath154 as the control parameter , the second derivative of the ground - state energy can be expressed as @xcite @xmath155 here @xmath89 is the ground - state energy , @xmath156 are the eigenstates of @xmath157 , and @xmath158 is the ground state . on the other hand ,",

    "obviously , such a transformation keeps the energy - level structures invariant and the critical behavior of the system is thus @xmath159 independent .",
    "the eigenvalues are only characterized by the parameter @xmath164 . on the other hand",
    ", we note that the geometric phase adiabatically undergoing a closed path @xmath165 in the @xmath159 space can be expressed as @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the berry curvature given by @xmath168 from the expressions of eqs .",
    "( [ 2de ] ) and ( [ curvature ] ) , it is not hard to find that for both of them the singularities may come from the vanishing energy gap in the thermodynamic limit . in the inhomogeneous @xmath0 model , we find that a gapless excitation occurs only when @xmath169 or @xmath170 , which demands @xmath171 .",
    "hence , this condition can be achieved only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath172 and for the appropriate parameters of the hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath173 .",
    "apart from these special cases , there exist no solution for @xmath174 or @xmath175 and a non - zero energy gap opened .",
