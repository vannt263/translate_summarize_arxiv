    "since several groups reported evidence for bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in atomic gas samples of @xmath1rb @xcite , @xmath2na @xcite  and possibly @xmath0li @xcite last year , there has been an increased interest in this field of physics . after almost two decades , one has finally been able to verify the prediction which bose and in particular einstein launched for so many years ago .",
    "this opens a totally new era regarding research on degenerate systems , and it is to be expected that there will appear many new and interesting experimental and theoretical results about the properties of bose condensed atomic gases in the near future .",
    "this is certainly true for the @xmath1rb and the @xmath2na systems , but maybe less so for the @xmath0li system , because the experimental results on the latter gas are not yet completely understood .",
    "in contrast to the former systems where the atoms have a positive s - wave scattering length @xmath3 , @xmath0li atoms have a negative s - wave scattering length .",
    "this leads to an effectively attractive interatomic interaction , which makes the system unstable at large densities .",
    "indeed one of us showed that a dilute , homogeneous gas of atoms with a negative s - wave scattering length @xmath3 collapses to a dense ( liquid or solid ) state before the density is reached at which bec is expected to occur at a given temperature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the bec transition is actually preceded by a bcs - like transition to a superfluid state and that this transition also occurs in the unstable regime of the phase diagram .    however , as was pointed out by hulet @xciteand ruprecht _ et al . _ @xcite the situation is different if the atoms are confined by a magnetic trap .",
    "in particular , it was found that for an inhomogeneous gas cloud at zero temperature the condensate is stable at the mean - field level if the number of particles is sufficiently small , or more precisely if @xmath4 , where @xmath5  is the typical size of the one - particle ground state in the trap . however , quantum fluctuations cause a decay of the condensate on a timescale which is fortunately much longer than the timescales at which the experiments were performed .",
    "the same holds true at the relatively high temperatures of interest experimentally , even though the decay is now caused by thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite  only the stability of the condensate was discussed .",
    "although this is an important first step , it is clearly not sufficient , because we know from the homogeneous case that also the non - condensed gas can be unstable against density fluctuations",
    ". therefore we will consider here the stability of the complete system including condensate as well as above condensate particles .",
    "we will try to answer the question when the system as a whole becomes unstable and whether it is the condensate part or the non - condensate part which causes the instability .    in this stability analysis we can not make use of the simple local - density approximation .",
    "the local - density approximation is only applicable in systems for which the correlation length @xmath6   ( roughly speaking the distance over which the particles influence each other ) is much smaller than the typical trap size @xmath7  over which the density changes and the system behaves locally homogeneous .",
    "however , close to the critical temperature the correlation length diverges , and the local - density approximation always breaks down . nevertheless , it is valid at the spinodal point if we satisfy the condition that @xmath8 or equivalently @xmath9 @xcite , i.e.the total number @xmath10  of particles in the gas must be much larger then the third power of the maximum number of condensate particles @xmath11 .",
    "since this amounts to @xmath12  for the trap parameters of the rice experiment @xcite , it is clear that on the basis of the local - density approximation we can not decide if a cloud of @xmath13  atoms is mechanically stable and therefore ( meta)stable . on the other hand , if it were allowed to use the local density approximation at the spinodal point , we would immediately conclude that a ( meta)stable condensate can not exist .    to go beyond the local - density approximation , we will present numerical results for the free energy of the system at several temperatures . to do so , we first present in sec .",
    "[ theorie ]  the finite temperature theory for the inhomogeneous gas .",
    "the equations of motion that describe the gas are derived from a variational principle @xcite .",
    "in analogy to the homogeneous case , we incorporate the possibility of both a bec and a bcs transition .",
    "subsequently we give an expression for the free energy . since the experiments with @xmath0li are performed at densities and temperatures such that @xmath14 ( where @xmath15  is the density and @xmath16  the thermal wavelength of the atoms ) and in particular even at @xmath17 , the theory can be simplified by neglecting the possible bcs pairing and using the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "however , in view of the fast experimental developments , it is to be expected that also the regime @xmath18 , which amounts to @xmath19 , can be reached in the near future and this is why we present here the full theory including also the effects of bcs pairing . in sec .",
    "[ resultaat ]  we then present our numerical results . in sec .",
    "[ tnul ]  we discuss the zero temperature limit of the hartree - fock approximation and make a comparison with previous calculations .",
    "also a thermodynamic criterion for the stability of the gas is given .",
    "[ teindig ]  we proceed to non - zero temperatures .",
    "we calculate the maximum number of condensate particles as a function of temperature and pronounce upon the issue whether the condensate or the non - condensate causes the instability of the gas .",
    "the paper ends in sec .",
    "[ conclusie ]  with some conclusions .",
    "we start this paper with the equilibrium theory for a dilute gas of particles with mass @xmath20  in an external trap potential @xmath21 , interacting with each other through an approximately local ( because @xmath22 ) two - body potential @xmath23 . in the numerical calculations which follow subsequently , we will specialize to @xmath0li atoms , which have a negative s - wave scattering length @xmath3  and @xmath24 .",
    "the interparticle interaction is therefore effectively attractive .",
    "the grand - canonical hamiltonian of the system is given by @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26  is the chemical potential and @xmath27  respectively @xmath28  annihilates and creates a particle at position @xmath29 .",
    "as usual , the density of particles in the system @xmath30  is given by the grand canonical average @xmath31 , and the total number of particles is @xmath32 , which ultimately determines the chemical potential of the gas .    for particles with a positive s - wave scattering length @xmath3 ,",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath27  has a non - vanishing expectation value below the critical temperature . by separating out this expectation value in the usual way @xcite , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34  describes",
    "the non - condensate part and @xmath35  is the condensate wave function , one can derive the equations of motion for the condensate as well as the non - condensate part of the gas .",
    "however , in the case of a negative s - wave scattering length , it can be shown for the homogeneous case that the free energy as a function of the expectation value of the field operator @xmath36  has at low temperatures a local _ maximum _ for some non - zero value of @xmath37  and there is only a local _ minimum _ for @xmath38 , which is therefore the correct value around which one has to expand @xcite . as a result",
    "we must use a different order parameter to describe a phase transition due to quantum degeneracy effects , namely the bcs - type order parameter @xmath39 . in the case of bosons ,",
    "this is actually known as the evans - rashid order parameter .      to derive the equations of motion that describe the gas , it is useful to determine the ( exact ) grand - canonical potential @xmath40 from which all thermodynamic quantities that we wish to know can be calculated",
    ". it is well known that if @xmath41  is some trial hamiltonian , and @xmath42  the corresponding grand - canonical potential , we have the variational principle @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44  is the expectation value of the operator @xmath45 in the grand - canonical ensemble based on @xmath41 .",
    "the trial hamiltonian that we want to use here is given by @xmath46 it is quadratic in the field operators and indeed has non - zero expectation values for both @xmath47  and @xmath48 . in this expression ,",
    "the functions @xmath49 , @xmath50and it s complex conjugate @xmath51  are variational parameters which have to be determined by minimization of the grand - canonical potential @xmath52 .",
    "the trial hamiltonian has non - diagonal elements proportional to the bcs order parameter @xmath50  and the diagonal contribution proportional to @xmath49  is the self - energy due to the two - body interaction .",
    "this trial hamiltonian can be put into the diagonal form @xmath53 by applying the bogoliubov transformation    @xmath54    @xmath55    [ trafo ]    the operators @xmath56  and @xmath57  are required to satisfy the usual bose commutation relations , and therefore the functions @xmath58  and @xmath59  are normalized as @xmath60 = \\sum_j \\left(u_j(\\vec{r } ) u_j^*(\\vec{r } ' ) - v_{j}^ * ( \\vec{r } ) v_j(\\vec{r } ' ) \\right ) = \\delta ( \\vec{r } - \\vec{r } ' ) .",

    "( [ min ] ) requires that @xmath78 and @xmath79 as is explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , to incorporate all two - body scattering processes in this many - particle system , the factor @xmath80  in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) must be replaced by the many - body t - matrix @xmath81 , but in the regime of interest where the temperature is large compared to the average interaction energy , i.e.   @xmath14 , this can be approximated by the two - body scattering matrix @xmath82  and we find the usual hartree - fock contribution to the self - energy @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , eq .  ( [ gap ] ) corresponds to the gap equation of bcs theory .",
    "since this theory already incorporates all ladder diagrams , the factor @xmath80  should here not be replaced by the many - body t - matrix .",
    "collecting together all terms , we find for the thermodynamic potential @xmath84 from this expression the free energy of the system can be calculated directly using the thermodynamic identity @xmath85 .",
    "the equations obtained thus far are only valid when there is no bose condensate present .",
    "however , as in the homogeneous case , it is evident that the lowest energy @xmath86  will go through zero at sufficiently low temperatures and at this point the corresponding one - particle ground state becomes macroscopically occupied , i.e.  a bose condensate is formed .",
    "hence , this ground state has then to be considered explicitly .",
    "we now adress the changes in the above equations that are required if a bose condensate is present .",
    "first , we consider the limit @xmath87 , for which all particles in the system tend to occupy the ground state . in the ( trial )",
    "grand - canonical ensemble @xmath88 = \\mbox{tr } [   \\exp{(-\\beta e_g -\\beta \\sum_j \\hbar \\omega_j b_j^{\\dag } b_j)}\\ ] ] used thus far , one can calculate by standard - statistical physics methods , that for any @xmath89  the expectation value @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , the factor of 2 in the self - energy eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) originates from this property .",
    "however , at zero temperature all particles will tend to the ground state and we therefore find that the fluctuations in the total number of particles are given by @xmath92 and of order @xmath93   instead of the usual @xmath94 .",
    "hence the fluctuations in the particle number are as large as the average itself , which leads to the conclusion that the use of the grand - canonical ensemble does not lead to an appropriate description of the bose condensed gas .",
    "there are basically two ways to restrict the grand - canonical ensemble and circumvent this problem .",
    "the first one is to introduce a condensate expectation value according to @xmath95 .",
    "clearly , we then have @xmath96 , and at zero temperature we end up with @xmath97  instead of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) . for non - zero temperatures",
    "the effect will be that the ground - state wave function satisfies eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) with @xmath98 , whereas the excited state wave functions obey the same equation except that now @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , the free - energy density now contains the term @xmath100  instead of @xmath101  ( c.f .",
    "( [ om ] ) and use @xmath102 ) .",
    "thus from energy considerations , it is indeed favorable to introduce a condensate expectation value if the s - wave scattering length is positive ( @xmath103 ) , but this is not the case for negative @xmath3 . as mentioned previously , it can be shown that the thermodynamic potential @xmath104  is a mexican hat shaped function with extremum at @xmath105 , which is however inverted with respect to the @xmath106-plane when the scattering length @xmath3  changes from positive to negative @xcite .",
    "therefore , the local minimum at @xmath107  that is present for @xmath108  becomes a local maximum for @xmath109 , and the local minimum of the thermodynamic potential occurs at @xmath110  in the latter case .",
    "so , for a gas of @xmath0li atoms , the use of the order parameter @xmath106  appears not to be the correct way to control the fluctuations in the number of condensate particles .",
    "the second method to restrict the condensate fluctuations is to introduce a different restricted grand - canonical ensemble according to @xmath111 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{n_0 } \\mbox{tr } \\left [ \\mbox{e}^ { - \\beta e_g -\\beta \\sum_j \\hbar \\omega_j   b^{\\dag}_j b_j } \\",
    "\\delta_{b^{\\dag}_0 b_0 , n_0 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & \\sum_{n_0 } \\mbox{e}^{-\\beta \\omega_t(\\mu , n_0 ) } \\label{zgroot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 from these expressions it follows that @xmath113 the total number of particles is therefore given by @xmath114 . moreover , the largest contribution to the sum over the number of condensate particles in eq .",
    "( [ zgroot ] ) comes from a minimum in @xmath42 , which implies that @xmath115  if @xmath116  and @xmath117  if @xmath118 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath119  calculated in this restricted grand - canonical ensemble ( by construction ) equals @xmath120 , whereas for the other energy levels ( @xmath121 ) nothing has changed compared with the results in the original grand - canonical ensemble . in conclusion",
    "we therefore arrive at the _ same _ equations for the ground state and the excited state wave functions as we had derived by the first method for a gas with positive s - wave scattering length : the ground - state wave function @xmath122  satisfies eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) with @xmath123 t^{2b}$]whereas the excited states have just @xmath124 .",
    "in addition , the condensate density obeys @xmath125  for @xmath126  will of course also change the free energy if the system is bose condensed .",
    "taking this change into account , the grand - canonical potential @xmath52  turns out to be given by eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) except that the term @xmath126  must be excluded from the summation over states and a term @xmath127 must be added . as a result",
    ", the free energy becomes @xmath128 .",
    "\\label{free10}\\ ] ] note that the self energy @xmath129  for the groundstate contains a term @xmath130 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - body scattering matrix in this term should again have been the many - body t - matrix . however , at sufficiently high temperatures such that @xmath131 , or even in the opposite regime if the interaction energy between the atoms is smaller than the energy splitting of the one - particle states , i.e.  @xmath132 , the many - body t - matrix @xmath81 can be approximated by @xmath133 .      for the homogeneous gas with effectively attractive interactions ,",
    "the free - energy density satisfies @xmath134 , and the chemical potential @xmath26  as a function of the density @xmath15  becomes multivalued ( @xmath135  changes sign ) for smaller densities than those needed for bec .",
    "this is the instability criterium for the homogeneous system .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that in this case the bec transition is indeed preceded by a bcs transition , but that both transitions occur in the unstable regime of the phase diagram .",
    "however , in the introduction we already mentioned that in an inhomogeneous system a metastable condensate can exist if the number of condensate particles is sufficiently small , i.e. @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "qualitatively this can be understood from the fact that a collapse of the condensate requires that other harmonic oscillator states need to be mixed into the wave function of the condensate . for this energy",
    "is needed ( virtually ) , which can be supplied by the interactions provided that the densities in the system are sufficiently high . as a result ,",
    "when the density of the gas becomes so high that the system will collapse , there must be some radial unstable mode in the density fluctuations .",
    "systems of compact objects such as white dwarfs and neutron stars @xcite can also be unstable for collapse under certain conditions .",
    "although a compact object consists of degenerate fermions ( electrons , protons and neutrons ) , and furthermore time and length scales for stellar systems can not be compared with those of the bose condensate , the physics in both systems has interesting similarities .    indeed , the final state of a star when it has burnt up all it s nuclear fuel is a white dwarf , neutron star or black hole , depending on it s mass . such a compact object is formed because in the final stages the star still radiates energy at the expense of gravitational energy , i.e.  the system contracts .",
    "this can not go on indefinitely , because at a certain point , the electrons and protons in the star become degenerate .",
    "this causes an extra internal pressure and the star will come to equilibrium . for a white dwarf , which has a maximum mass of 1.4 times the solar mass ,",
    "this occurs at a radius of about 5000 km . in this stage",
    "the gradient of the pressure just cancels the gradient in potential energy .",
    "however , when the mass of the original star is between 1.4 and 3 times the solar mass , the gravitational force will be so strong that equilibrium can only be restored when almost all electrons and protons are squeezed together to neutrons by inverse @xmath137-decay : in that case the star contracts to an even more compact neutron star with a radius of about 10 km . above these definite maximum masses , the white dwarf respectively the neutron star can not support themselves against gravitational collapse and this can lead to black hole formation . to study the stability of these systems ,",
    "it is known that it is convenient to parametrize all equilibrium density profiles @xmath138 by the central density @xmath139  of the star and that at the point of instability the mass of the object as a function of the central density of matter @xmath139  exhibits an extremum .    in analogy",
    ", we thus expect that in the case of a trapped atomic gas , the onset of the instability is determined by the condition @xmath140  and that there exists a zero mode in the density fluctuations at this point . to see this more explicitly , we consider the free energy functional @xmath141 $ ] , which gives the free energy of the equilibrium density profile @xmath138 . as a result we have @xmath142 & = & f[n(\\vec{r};n_c ) ] + \\int d\\vec{r } \\",

    "\\delta n(\\vec{r } ) \\delta n(\\vec{r } ' ) + .... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 .",
    "if the central density is changed slightly , we have @xmath144 & =   & f[n(\\vec{r};n_c ) + \\frac{\\partial n(\\vec{r } ; n_c)}{\\partial n_c } \\delta n_c   + { \\cal o}(\\delta n_c^2 ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & f[n(\\vec{r};n_c ) ] + \\int d \\vec{r}\\ \\mu(n_c ) \\frac{\\partial n(\\vec{r};n_c)}{\\partial n_c } \\delta n_c + { \\cal o}(\\delta n_c^2 ) . \\label{dfdn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we thus conclude that if @xmath145 , then either @xmath146  or @xmath147 .",
    "the latter possibility is in general the physically relevant one because it shows that the two density profiles @xmath138  and @xmath148have the same total number of particles , i.e. @xmath149 the fact that two density profiles containing the same number of particles have the same free energy up to first order indicates that there is a zero mode present . roughly speaking",
    ", it does not cost energy to deform the first density profile continuously into the second , which indicates the threshold for instability .",
    "we therefore anticipate that the onset of instability occurs if the free energy has an extremum which conserves particle number ( i.e.  @xmath150 ) as a function of the central density of the gas .",
    "so , although collapse in compact objects respectively in a bose condensate is caused by a different mechanism , the final criterion in both system may be , surprisingly enough , the same .",
    "we have derived the equations that describe an inhomogeneous gas at non - zero temperatures .",
    "a convenient procedure to solve these equations numerically , would be to start with some suitable initial distribution of particles @xmath30  and an initial bcs order parameter @xmath50 , and iterate the equations to selfconsistency .",
    "it is , however , well known that it is rather difficult to ensure the selfconsistency of @xmath50  @xcite , and furthermore that eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) contains a divergence , because the interparticle potential was approximated by a @xmath151-function potential . for a homogeneous gas ,",
    "this divergence can easily be corrected for , but in this inhomogeneous case , it is not _ a priori _  clear how one has to deal with it properly , although it is not difficult to convince oneself that the divergence can be canceled by calculating the molecular states of two atoms in the trap . fortunately it is not necessary to solve these problems here because we are primarily interested in the regime @xmath152 , where the average energy @xmath153  of the particles is much larger than the interaction energy and the effect of @xmath50  is very small",
    ". therefore , we neglect in the following the bcs order parameter @xmath50 , which in turn means that the functions @xmath154 .",

    "if the density increases further , the gas will collapse to a dense state . with the theory presented above we",
    "clearly can not describe the gas beyond this point , for we would need a theory that can describe the system also at high densities .      for non - zero temperatures the particles in the gas occupy the harmonic oscillator states in eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) according to the normal bose distribution at a given chemical potential .",
    "however , if @xmath26  is increased from @xmath186  to some value below @xmath187 , the number of particles in the ground state starts to increase dramatically , and we can only put more particles in the system by forcing them into the ground state . at this point , @xmath86  equals zero and the gas consists of a condensate part with density @xmath188 , as well as a non - condensate part with density @xmath189 .",
    "so , the calculation of the chemical potential and the free energy now consists of two parts which correspond to the use of the unrestricted and restricted grand - canonical ensemble respectively .",
    "in the first part we increase @xmath26  from @xmath186  to some maximum value @xmath190 , above which there are no longer any solutions . in the second part we on the other hand increase the number @xmath163  of particles in the ground state and then determine @xmath26  from the ground - state energy of the trap using that @xmath191 .",
    "note that in this second part the chemical potential decreases again , because the increasing density of the condensate lowers the ground - state energy .",
    "this behaviour of the chemical potential explains why no solutions with @xmath192  could be found in the calculation with the unrestricted grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "the two parts of the calculation join smoothly together within an error of the order of @xmath193  at @xmath190   where the condensate fraction is of the order of @xmath194 .    at non - zero temperatures",
    "the density profiles of the gas are determined by calculating all energy levels and corresponding eigenfunctions up to @xmath195 . since the ideal 3d harmonic oscillator energy levels",
    "are given by @xmath196  where @xmath15  and @xmath197are integers , this corresponds to taking as many as @xmath198  levels into account .",
    "clearly , this number increases rapidly as a function of temperature . when the number of particles in the groundstate is small ( typically corresponding to @xmath199 ) , eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) was used to calculate all wave functions and eq .",
    "( [ vrijeenergie ] ) to calculate the free energy . for larger values of @xmath26 ,",
    "the groundstate was determined by eq .",
    "( [ schrodingercond ] ) and the free energy by eq .",
    "( [ vrijeenergiecond ] ) . to check that our results are consistent , we first compare in fig .",
    "[ fig40 ]  the density profile above the critical temperature with the prediction of the local - density approximation , i.e.  with @xmath200}),\\ ] ] the agreement is good for large and negative @xmath26 , but for @xmath201 , a deviation becomes visible around the center of the trap , indicating that the critical temperature is approached .    in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] the free energy is plotted as a function of the ( total ) central density of the gas at @xmath202  and @xmath203  respectively .",
    "we again checked that @xmath184  as required .",
    "the inset in both figures shows a magnification of the local minimum in the free energy curve where @xmath26  goes through zero .",
    "this is not a point of instability of the system because small variations in the central density do not conserve the total number of particles .",
    "the point of instability occurs again where the free energy approaches a local maximum .",
    "note that the maximum densities in the center of the trap that can be obtained are orders of magnitude higher then those for a homogeneous trap . in the homogeneous case",
    ", collapse occurs already at densities smaller than @xmath204 . for @xmath205",
    "this corresponds to @xmath206@xmath207 , and for @xmath203  we have @xmath208@xmath207 .",
    "note furthermore that the interaction term @xmath209 t^{2b}$]in the effective potential @xmath210  of the groundstate becomes in the center of the trap as large as @xmath211 .",
    "next we take a closer look at the point of instability of the system when the temperature increases . as was pointed out before however , the number of harmonic oscillator states which have to be taken into account to calculate the density acurately increases very rapidly and thus slows down the calculation considerably . to avoid this ,",
    "we make for temperatures higher than @xmath212nk use of the fact that only the lowest wave functions of the harmonic oscillator states are influenced by the interaction term @xmath213  or @xmath214t^{2b}$ ]  for the ground state , and the wave functions of the higher states are unaffected , although their occupation numbers change , due to the fact that @xmath26  equals the ground - state energy if there is a bose condensate present .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we plot at the point of instability the normal density of the gas in the center of the trap @xmath215  as a function of temperature ( dashed line ) and compare this with the density @xmath216  ( solid line ) required for bec in the homogeneous case .",
    "in the inset of the same figure , the number of noncondensed particles as a function of temperature is plotted ( dashed line ) , and this is compared with the usual criterion for the onset of bec in a noninteracting gas , i.e.   @xmath217 ( solid line ) . as expected , the consequence of the attractive interatomic interaction is that the non - condensed particles are pulled towards the center of the trap . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the maximum number of condensate particles as a function of temperature . clearly , the occupation of the condensate at the point where the gas becomes unstable decreases when the temperature increases . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that an increase in temperature would _ not _ lead to a decrease in the maximum number of condensate particles since the non - condensed density is approximately constant over the extend of the condensate wave function and therefore only shifts the effective potential @xmath210  by a constant .",
    "if this is true , the observed decrease can only be explained by the non - condensed part of the gas becoming unstable before the condensate holds the maximum number of particles .",
    "this might also be physically reasonable because the contribution of the normal part of the gas to the total density increases everywhere and especially around the center of the trap .    in view of this",
    "we want to try to answer the question whether it is the condensate or ( as in the homogeneous case ) the non - condensed part of the gas which causes instability .",
    "of course , for zero temperature the condensate becomes unstable , and we expect the same for such low temperatures that the non - condensed part is only a small fraction of the gas . for higher temperatures this might change since the number of non - condensed particles increases very rapidly as a function of temperature . to analyse this issue , we calculated in the temperature interval @xmath218nk the density profiles of the condensate @xmath219  and the normal part of the gas @xmath220  at the spinodal point .",
    "the condensate fraction @xmath221  decreases from 1 for @xmath167  to about 0.005 for @xmath222nk .",
    "subsequently , we try to add particles to the condensate , and try to find a new solution to the non - linear schrdinger equation eq .",
    "( [ schrodingercond ] ) for the increased number of condensate particles , _ while keeping the non - condensate density profile fixed . _",
    "the results are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] : the dots in this figure denote the maximum number of particles that can be in the condensate given the non - condensate density at the temperature of interest .",
    "for temperatures @xmath223nk , the system becomes already unstable if only one particle is added to the condensate , from which we draw the conclusion that at this temperature it is still the condensate which renders the instability . for higher temperatures ,",
    "it is possible to add a few particles to the condensate , but this appears te be the result of numerical unaccuracies of our calculation .",
    "we thus conclude that the condensate is unstable at the point of instability of the whole system .    because of this result",
    ", we suspect that the simple argument that the maximum number of condensate particles remains constant because the non - condensed part of the gas is approximately constant over the extend of the condensate wavefunction , may not be sufficiently accurate in this system .",
    "the only difference in the condensate wave function at different temperatures arises due to the contribution of the term @xmath224  to the effective potential . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we plotted for @xmath167  ( and consequently @xmath225 ) ( solid lines ) , and for @xmath226nk ( dashed lines ) the effective potential @xmath227  and the corresponding condensate densities @xmath219 .",
    "when @xmath210  for @xmath226nk is shifted upward such that the zero of both potentials coincide , it is clear that the normal part of the gas effectively increases the oscillator strength of the trap potential when the temperature increases . since the maximum condensate size @xmath228 , an increase in the effective oscillator strength felt by the condensate causes a decrease in the maximum condensate size .",
    "a measure for the deviation of the effective oscillator strength from the original strength @xmath170  is given by the expression @xmath229t^{2b})n_0(r)}{\\int d\\vec{r}\\ v_{ext}(r ) n_0(r)},\\ ] ] and for non - zero temperature we thus estimate that the maximum number of condensate particles is given by @xmath230 for @xmath226nk this amounts to @xmath231 , which corresponds rather accurately with the value 1173 from our full calculation .",
    "for some other temperatures the maximum occupation of the condensate determined in this way is denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ]  by the open circles .",
    "we can conclude that the growth of the normal part of the gas occurs at the expense of the condensate when temperature increases .",
    "we performed a numerical calculation to study the stability of a bose condensate in a trapped gas of @xmath0li atoms at zero and non - zero temperatures .",
    "this was done by determining all quantum states for particles in a harmonic oscillator trap and interacting via two - body scattering . the proposed criterion that the gas becomes mechanically unstable when the free energy of the system as a function of the central density of the gas approaches a maximum value , is confirmed by the calculations .    for zero temperature ,",
    "the maximum number of condensate particles is in agreement with previous calculations , and for non - zero temperature this number decreases considerably .",
    "this is due to the fact that the condensate experiences an effective oscillator strength due to the presence of the non - condensed part of the gas .",
    "this effective potential increases as temperature increases and therefore results in a decrease of the maximum occupation of the condensate .",
    "for the temperature interval @xmath218  the condensed part of the gas renders the instability at the spinodal point , so in contrast to the homogeneous case , the normal part of the gas remains stable against density fluctuations .    furthermore , from the results in sec .",
    "[ teindig ]  and the discussion in sec .",
    "[ bec ] , it can be concluded that at low temperatures it seems necessary to include also many - body effects in e.g.   the scattering length , since the average interaction @xmath232  becomes substantially larger than the energy splitting @xmath233 .",
    "to do so appears to be an important challenge for the future which is not only difficult in practice but even in principle due to the presence of infra - red divergences in the theory of the dilute bose gas @xcite . closely related to this issue",
    "is the effect of the bcs transition on the properties of the gas , which still needs to be incorporated in the numerical calculations .",
    "once the experiments enter into this low temperature regime where @xmath234 , it should be interesting to compare the experimental data with the mean - field analysis presented here , and to see if possible deviations can be understood by the above mentioned corrections .",
    "this is of course not only true for @xmath0li , but also for any other atomic species with a negative scattering length such as @xmath235rb and @xmath236cs .",
    "we would like to thank chris pethick for pointing out to us the analogy between the metastable bose condensate and compact objects and the stability criteria of the latter system .",
    "furthermore we thank randy hulet and keith burnett for various enlightening discussions .",
    "to calculate the minimum of the grand - canonical potential @xmath52  of eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) , it is convenient in the following to introduce a compact notation for the inner product of two states . from eq .",
    "( [ normering ] ) , it is found that the normalization can be rewritten as @xmath237 which thus defines our convention for the inner product .",
    "we start with the derivative of @xmath52  with respect to @xmath238 .",
    "it is given by @xmath239 equating the whole expression to zero , and grouping together the terms proportional to the derivative of an expectation value with respect to @xmath129 , the solution is seen to be given by eq .",

( [ egap ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath249    the factor between brackets is zero .",
    "this can be seen by first applying a taylor expansion to show that the energy change @xmath250  due to the shift @xmath251  can be written as @xmath252 therefore , the last term between the brackets in eq.([egap2 ] ) can be identified with twice the second - order energy shift . making then use of the standard expression for this second - order energy shift @xmath253 which still holds with our new definition of the inner product , we obtain @xmath254 where the third line follows from the completeness of the eigenstates of the bogoliubov - degennes equation and from the fact that if we write @xmath255  only the antisymmetric part contributes .",
    "finally , we also need that @xmath256 collecting all terms together we thus indeed find that ( see eq .",
