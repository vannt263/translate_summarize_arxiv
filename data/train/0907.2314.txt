    "correspondingly to the dominant pair of peaks , the density correlation function [ panels ( a , b ) ] shows a periodic fringe pattern of wavelength @xmath175 that travels away from @xmath176 at the group velocity @xmath177 .",
    "the envelope of the fringe pattern follows the envelope of the oscillating @xmath4 modulation .    at a finite temperature ( thin red lines ) , the resonance peaks in the bogoliubov mode occupation @xmath65 are almost completely hidden by the thermal component , but remain perfectly visible and even reinforced in the anomalous average @xmath67 . correspondingly , the moving fringe pattern experiences an overall amplification without any significant distortion of the oscillating shape nor of its envelope .",
    "the simple relations ( [ eq : g2anal ] ) and ( [ eq : a_k_gen ] ) that relate the density correlation at the end of the modulation sequence to the initial thermal occupation of the mode can be exploited as a simple way to precisely measure the temperature of the system in an almost non - destructive way .",
    "this proposal extends an original suggestion of  @xcite to measure the temperature of a bose - einstein condensate using a parametric modulation of some parameter : as illustrated in fig.[fig : periodic](c ) , looking at the density correlation rather than at the bogoliubov mode occupation has the significant advantage that the interesting signal is not hidden by a broad thermal pedestal .",
    "in contrast to the case of a single jump discussed  @xcite , a periodic modulation is able to concentrate the interesting signal into a single bogoliubov mode and , more remarkably , to make it significantly stronger without distorting it .",

    "a critical issue in view of an experimental verification of the conclusions of the present paper as well as of the predictions of  @xcite is the actual value of the density correlation signal that one is to detect : given its relatively small value , methods to reinforce it can be of crucial importance . in the present section we apply to the dynamical casimir effect a diagnostic trick that was recently used to characterize phase fluctuations of a quasi - condensate in a strongly one - dimensional geometry e.g. in  @xcite and that was recently put forward in the context of observing the analog hawking radiation  @xcite .",
