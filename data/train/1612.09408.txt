    "the _ kepler _ satellite provides the highly precise and nearly - continuous photometric data for @xmath15 200,000 objects that has helped to revolutionize the study of stars themselves , as well as extrasolar planets ( borucki et al .",
    "2010 ; koch et al .",
    "there are 2878 eclipsing and ellipsoidal binaries in the _ kepler _ main field of view ( kirk et al .",
    "2016 ) , corresponding to about 1.3 % of all observed targets . eclipsing binaries ( ebs )",
    "serve as critical tools that provide an accurate and direct determination of fundamental stellar parameters such as the mass and radius for each component .",
    "these data allow us to test stellar evolution models and to determine distances of binary systems ( torres et al .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to measure precisely mid - eclipse times from binary light curves .",
    "the timing measurements are used to investigate a variety of physical phenomena causing the orbital period changes of ebs ( hilditch 2001 ; kreiner et al .",
    "such examples are mass transfer , angular momentum loss , apsidal motion in an elliptical orbit , third - body effect , and magnetic activity cycle .",
    "ebs with pulsating components are very promising objects for the study of stellar structure and evolution , because binarity provides useful information about the components and asteroseismology assists in probing the interiors of stars .",
    "most of them have been found to be @xmath12 sct - type pulsators of classical semi - detached algols ( mkrtichian et al .",
    "2004 ; liakos & niarchos 2016b ) . the @xmath12 sct stars are dwarfs and subgiants with spectral types a and f located in the lower portion of the cepheid instability strip .",
    "they pulsate in low - order pressure ( @xmath16 ) modes with typical periods of 0.02@xmath80.25 days and amplitudes of less than 0.1 mag ( breger 2000 ; rodrguez & breger 2001 ) .",
    "the pulsations are driven by the @xmath17 mechanism mostly due to partial ionization of he ii .",
    "the @xmath12 sct variables in binaries have pulsation features similar to single @xmath12 sct stars , but their pulsations can be affected by mass transfer between both components and gravitation forces from companions .",
    "recently , liakos & niarchos ( 2015 , 2016a ) showed that there is a threshold in the orbital period of @xmath15 13 days below which the pulsations are influenced by the binarity . in eccentric - orbit binaries , some pulsations can be excited by tidal interaction .",
    "the signature of the tidally excited modes is the frequencies at multiples of the orbital frequency ( welsh et al .",
    "2011 ; hambleton et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "this paper is the fifth contribution in a series of detailed studies for pulsating stars in the _ kepler _ ebs ( lee et al .",
    "2014 , 2016a , b ; lee 2016 ) .",
    "we present that kic 11401845 ( r.a.@xmath18 = 19@xmath1925@xmath2011@xmath21 ; decl.@xmath18 = + 49@xmath2214@xmath2340@xmath2409 ; @xmath25 = @xmath2614.355 ; @xmath27 = @xmath2614.443 ; @xmath28 = @xmath260.118 ) is a detached eb exhibiting multiperiodic pulsations and light - travel - time ( ltt ) delay .",
    "the system was announced to be an eb pulsating at frequencies of 13@xmath825 d@xmath9 by gaulme & guzik ( 2014 ) .",
    "the _ kepler _ data of kic 11401845 were obtained in a long cadence mode of 29.42 minutes during quarters 10 and 12 .",
    "we used the sap ( simple aperture photometry ) time - series data in data release 25 retrieved from the _ kepler _ data archive .",
    "the raw data were detrended by using second - order polynomials that were separately applied to each quarter .",
    "as eclipses influence the detrending process , we fitted the polynomial to only the outside - eclipse part of the light curve ( e.g. , hambleton et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the flux measurements were converted to a magnitude scale by requiring a _",
    "_ magnitude of + 14.355 at maximum light .",
    "the detrended _ kepler _ data are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "the shape of the light curve indicates a significant temperature difference between the binary components and an ellipsoidal variation due to tidal distortions .    to derive the binary parameters of this system , all _ kepler",
    "_ data were analyzed using the wilson - devinney binary program ( wilson & devinney 1971 , van hamme & wilson 2007 ; hereafter w - d ) .",
    "this synthesis was performed in a way similar to that for the pulsating ebs v404 lyr ( lee et al .",
    "2014 ) and kic 6220497 ( lee et al .",
    "the effective temperature of the hotter and more massive star was set to be 7590 k from the _ kepler _ input catalogue ( kic ; kepler mission team 2009 ) .",
    "the logarithmic bolometric ( @xmath29 ) and monochromatic ( @xmath30 ) limb - darkening coefficients were interpolated from the values of van hamme ( 1993 ) . in table 1",
    ", the parentheses signify the adjusted parameters . in this article ,",
    "the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the primary and secondary components being eclipsed at orbital phases 0.0 ( min i ) and 0.5 ( min ii ) , respectively .",
    "there has been neither a light - curve solution nor spectroscopic mass ratio ( @xmath1 ) for kic 11401845 so far .",
    "thus , we conducted a photometric @xmath1-search procedure that calculates a series of models with varying @xmath1 from 0 to 1 . for each assumed mass ratio ,",
    "the w - d code was applied for various modes but converged satisfactorily only when detached mode 2 were used .",
    "the weighted sum of the squared residuals , @xmath31 , reached a minimum around @xmath1 = 0.07 , which was adopted as the initial value and thereafter adjusted to derive the photometric solutions .",
    "the result is given as model 1 in the second and third columns of table 1 .",
    "the synthetic light curve appears as the blue solid curve in figure 1 , and the corresponding light residuals are plotted as the gray ` x ' symbols in the figure . in all the procedures",
    ", we considered an orbital eccentricity ( @xmath32 ) and a third light ( @xmath33 ) as additional free parameters .",
    "both searches led to values for the two parameters which were zero within their errors , which implies that kic 11401845 has negligible eccentricity .",
    "we obtained the errors for the adjustable parameters by splitting the _ kepler _ data into 79 segments at intervals of an orbital period and analyzing them separately ( koo et al .",
    "2014 ) . in table 1 , the error of each parameter is its standard deviation computed from this process .    absolute parameters for kic 11401845 can be computed from our light - curve solutions in table 1 and from the correlations between spectral type ( temperature ) and stellar mass .",
    "the surface temperature ( @xmath34 = 7590 k ) of the primary star corresponds to a normal dwarf one with a spectral type of @xmath15a8v . assuming that each component has a temperature error of 200 k , the primary s mass was estimated to be @xmath35 = 1.70@xmath130.08 @xmath36 from harmanec s ( 1988 ) empirical relation .",
    "we calculated the absolute dimensions for each component given in the last part of table 1 . here",
    ", the luminosity ( @xmath37 ) and bolometric magnitudes ( @xmath38 ) were derived by using @xmath39@xmath40 = 5780 k and @xmath38@xmath40 = + 4.73 .",
    "the bolometric corrections ( bcs ) were obtained from the expression between @xmath41 and bc given by torres ( 2010 ) .",
    "considering the temperature error of the primary star , we carried out the light - curve synthesis for 7390 k and 7790 k. the binary parameters from the two limits are in satisfactory agreement with those from @xmath34 = 7590 k , except for the secondary s temperature ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "in the three models , the temperature ratios ( @xmath42/@xmath34 ) of both components are consistent with each other within their errors .",
    "we can see that the adopted @xmath34 does not affect the results presented in this paper .",
    "from the temperature ( @xmath34 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath43 @xmath44 ) given in table 1 , the primary star of kic 11401845 resides within the @xmath12 sct instability strip and , hence , it would be a candidate for @xmath12 sct pulsations . for more reliable frequency analysis",
    ", we followed the procedure described by lee ( 2016 ) .",
    "first , we divided the observed _ kepler _ data of kic 11401845 into 79 subsets as before and modeled each light curve with the w - d code by adjusting only the ephemeris epoch ( @xmath45 ) in model 1 of table 1 .",
    "second , the corresponding residuals from the whole datasets were applied to multiple frequency analyses in the range from 0 to the nyquist limit of @xmath46 = 24.4 day@xmath9 using the period04 program ( lenz & breger 2005 ) . because the binary components block each other s lights during eclipses , we used only the outside - eclipse residuals ( orbital phases 0.07@xmath80.43 and 0.57@xmath80.93 ) . according to the successive prewhitening procedures",
    ", we detected the frequencies with signal to noise amplitude ( s / n ) ratios larger than 4.0 ( breger et al . 1993 ) .",
    "third , we solved the pulsation - subtracted data after removing the pulsations from the observed data . as a result",
    ", new binary parameters were obtained , and they were used to reanalyze the 79 light curves in the first stage .",
    "this process was repeated three times until the detected frequencies were unchanged .",
    "final binary parameters are given as model 2 in the fourth and fifth columns of table 1 , and the pulsation - subtracted data and model light curve are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "we can see that the physical parameters for model 2 are consistent with those for model 1 .",
    "figure 3 shows the light residuals after removal of the binary effects from the observed _ kepler _ data .",
    "we detected a total of 23 frequencies larger than the empirical threshold of s / n = 4.0 .",
    "the amplitude spectra before and after prewhitening the first 10 frequencies and then all 23 frequencies are shown in the first to third panels of figure 4 , respectively . the detailed result from the frequency analysis",
    "is listed in table 2 , where the frequencies are given in order of detection and the noises are calculated in the range of 5 day@xmath9 around each frequency .",
    "the uncertainties in the table were obtained according to kallinger et al .",
    "the synthetic curve computed from the 23-frequency fit is displayed in the lower panel of figure 3 .",
    "as listed in table 2 , four in the low - frequency region ( 0.4@xmath83.8 day@xmath9 ) and 19 in the high - frequency region ( 13.7@xmath823.8 day@xmath9 ) were derived from the multiple frequency analyses of the outside - eclipse light residuals . within the frequency resolution of 0.00545 day@xmath9 ( loumos & deeming 1978 )",
    ", we searched the frequencies for possible harmonic and combination terms .",
    "the result is given in the last column of table 2 .",
    "we think that the @xmath47 to @xmath48 frequencies mainly arise from combination frequencies , some of which can be caused by imperfect removal of the binary effects in the observed data . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - frequency signals close to the nyquist limit can be reflections of real frequencies ( 2@xmath49 ) higher than @xmath46 ( murphy et al .",
    "2013 ; lee et al .",
    "high - cadence photometry is needed to separate the nyquist aliases from the detected frequencies of kic 11401845 .",
    "for an orbital period study of kic 11401845 , we determined 150 minimum times and their uncertainties from the observations with the method of kwee & van woerden ( 1956 ) .",
    "these minima are listed in columns ( 1)(5 ) of table 3 , where we present the cycle numbers and @xmath50@xmath51 residuals calculated with the light elements ( @xmath45 and @xmath52 ) for model 2 in table 1 .",
    "the resultant eclipse timing diagram is displayed at the top panel of figure 5 .",
    "as shown in the figure , the timing residuals from the primary ( filled circle ) and secondary ( open circle ) eclipses do not agree with each other , which could be caused by the light variations due to the multiperiodic pulsations of the primary star .",
    "thus , we recalculated the minimum times from the eclipse light curve after subtracting the 23 frequencies detected in section 3 from the observed _ kepler _ data .",
    "the results are given in columns ( 6)(8 ) of table 3 and are illustrated in the middle panel of figure 5 .",
    "as displayed in figure 5 , the large discrepancy between min i and min ii is shown more clearly in the pulsation - subtracted data .",
    "this discrepancy can result from the time difference between the primary and secondary eclipses due to ltt in a binary with unequal masses ( barlow et al .",
    "2012 ; parsons et al .",
    "the rmer delay is given by kaplan ( 2010 ) , as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath52 is the orbital period , @xmath54 is the radial velocity ( rv ) semi - amplitude of the secondary star , and c is the speed of light . from the model",
    "2 parameters in table 1 , we derived the velocities ( @xmath55 = 13 km s@xmath9 and @xmath54 = 187 km s@xmath9 ) of the binary components ( hilditch 2001 ) . the time delay of @xmath56 = 34@xmath131 s was obtained by applying the values of @xmath54 , @xmath52 , and @xmath1 to equation ( 1 ) .    in order to examine this possibility , we computed the secondary eclipses related to one half period after the primary eclipses in the pulsation - subtracted data and then plotted the difference ( @xmath57 ) between the measured and computed secondary times in the bottom panel of figure 5 .",
    "as shown in the figure , the mean value is offset from zero and gives a time delay of @xmath57 = 56@xmath1317 s in the secondary eclipse .",
    "this value is calculated to be @xmath57 = 37@xmath1327 s in the observed _ kepler _ data including pulsations . within their errors ,",
    "the time delays of @xmath57 are in satisfactory accord with the predicted delay of @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "if kic 11401845 is in an eccentric orbit , @xmath57 might be affected by the time shift of @xmath58 in the secondary eclipse due to a non - zero eccentricity : @xmath59 where @xmath32 and @xmath60 are the eccentricity and the argument of periastron , respectively .",
    "using the equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , @xmath61 0.00003 for the observed data and",
    "@xmath61 0.00019 for the pulsation - subtracted data .",
    "we have studied the physical properties of kic 11401845 , based on the _ kepler _ data made during quarters 10 and 12 . the light curve of this system displays multiperiodic pulsations , superimposed on binary effects .",
    "to examine whether the binary parameters are affected by the pulsations , we analyzed individually the observed and pulsation - subtracted _ kepler _ data with the w - d code .",
    "as listed in table 1 , the photometric solutions for the two datasets are in good agreement with each other , which means that the pulsations cause little impact on the light - curve parameters .",
    "our light - curve synthesis shows that kic 11401845 is a short - period detached eb with a very small mass ratio of about 0.07 .",
    "the primary and secondary components fill @xmath2 = 45 % and @xmath3 = 99 % of their limiting lobe , respectively , where the filling factor @xmath62 . with its small @xmath1 and short @xmath52",
    ", our program target closely resembles the two _ kepler _ pulsating ebs kic 10661783 ( lehmann et al .",
    "2013 ) and kic 8262223 ( guo et al . 2016 ) , which are detached binaries with characteristics of the r cma - type stars ( budding & butland 2011 ; lee et al",
    ". 2016b ) among algols .",
    "a comparison of the kic 11401845 parameters with the mass - radius , mass - luminosity , and hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagrams ( ibanolu et al .",
    "2006 ) shows that the primary component resides within the main - sequence band . on the contrary ,",
    "the low mass secondary is highly evolved and its radius and luminosity are remarkably oversized and overluminous compared to main - sequence stars of the same mass .",
    "these suggest that the initial more massive star becomes the present secondary by losing most of its own mass via mass transfer to the companion ( present primary ) and stellar wind ( hong et al .",
    "2015 ; guo et al .",
    "2016 ) .    in order to detect the pulsation frequencies of kic 11401845 ,",
    "multiple frequency analyses were applied to the out - of - eclipse residuals after removing the binarity effects from the observed _ kepler _ data .",
    "we found 23 frequencies with s / n ratios larger than 4.0 in two regions : 0.4@xmath83.8 day@xmath9 and 13.7@xmath823.8 day@xmath9 . among these ,",
    "four ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) in the low frequency region are frequencies at exact multiples of the orbital frequency , @xmath63 = 0.46267 day@xmath9 .",
    "the orbital harmonics can be attributed to tidally excited modes , which occur when the orbital frequency is close to a stellar eigenfrequency in a binary star ( welsh et al .",
    "2011 ; hambleton et al .",
    "2013 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the other frequencies are strongly reminiscent of the @xmath16-mode pulsations known in ebs ( e.g. , southworth et al .",
    "2011 ; lee et al .",
    ". the ratios of the pulsational to orbital periods in the high - frequency region were calculated to be @xmath10 = 0.020@xmath80.034 , which is within the upper limit of 0.09 for @xmath12 sct stars in binaries ( zhang et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we calculated the pulsation constants by applying the model 2 parameters in table 1 to the equation of @xmath64 ( petersen & jrgensen 1972 ) .",
    "the result is listed in the sixth column of table 2 .",
    "the @xmath11 values of 0.018@xmath80.031 d correspond to @xmath16 modes of @xmath12 sct type .",
    "the period ratios , the pulsation constants , and the position on the hr diagram reveal that the primary component is a @xmath12 sct variable .",
    "the @xmath12 sct pulsations of kic 11401845 match well the correlations between the pulsation periods and other parameters ( binary periods , surface gravities of pulsators , and gravitational forces from companions ) updated by liakos & niarchos ( 2016b ) .",
    "we measured the minimum epochs of the primary and secondary eclipses from the observed and pulsation - subtracted data .",
    "inspecting them in detail , we found delays of about 37 s and 56 s in the arrival times of the secondary eclipses relative to the primary eclipses in the same order .",
    "the values are consistent with the expected time delay of @xmath56 = 34 s across the binary orbit .",
    "this indicates that the ltt delay is the main cause of the time discrepancy between both eclipses , which is the first detection of this effect in ebs consisting of non - compact components .",
    "one might imagine that the time delay of the secondary eclipse could be apportioned between the ltt delay and a non - zero eccentricity .",
    "the result presented in this paper limits the eccentricity of kic 11401845 to @xmath65 .",
    "when the high - resolution spectra are made , they will help to determine the rv semi - amplitudes ( @xmath66 ) and mass ratio ( @xmath1 ) of the binary star and hence to derive its small eccentricity ( @xmath32 ) . because the system is a faint pulsating eb with a short orbital period ,",
