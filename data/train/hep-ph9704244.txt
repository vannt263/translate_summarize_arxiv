    "flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in the standard model ( sm ) are absent at tree level and suppressed by the gim mechanism at one loop .",
    "they are particularly sensitive to large mass splittings between quarks of different generations .",
    "+ within the sm , the absence of tree - level fcnc implies that inside the loop only charged currents can mediate the flavour change and therefore the large splitting of the third generation in the up sector can only be effective in processes with external _",
    "d_-type quarks .",
    "+ the smallness of the mixing angles between the first two generations and the third one implies that the effects of a heavy top are particularly evident only in fcnc processes involving @xmath3 quarks , such as @xmath4 mixing , radiative @xmath5 decays , etc .",
    "the extensions of the standard model to multi - higgs doublet schemes allow for the presence of tree level fcnc which can be tested also with external up - type quarks and in particular in the fcnc top decays .",
    "this study was pursued in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that one could achieve values of the branching ratios of the order of @xmath6 , i.e. orders of magnitude bigger than the standard model estimates of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "tree - level fcnc vertices are also present in supersymmetric extensions of the sm . in particular , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , i.e. in the supersymmetric extension of the sm with minimal particle content , fcnc vertices involving fermions , sfermions and gauginos arise because of the misalignment of fermion and sfermion low - energy mass matrices . by imposing r parity , these vertices can only contribute to fcnc quark decays at one loop level via penguin diagrams in which the intermediate particles are gluinos . ] . the difference with sm w - mediated penguins , and with susy chargino - mediated penguins , is that gluino - mediated penguins involving external up - type quarks are proportional to the mass splitting between _ up - type _ squarks which closely follows the one of the corresponding non supersymmetric partners .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyse neutral current top decays , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . + we give the estimates for the mssm with flavour - universal soft susy breaking terms at the gut scale , and also for a more general class of models where such a flavour universality does not hold .",
    "the universal case was already discussed in the literature @xcite . in this case",
    "we have recomputed both charginos and gluinos contributions .",
    "+ we disagree with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite mainly in the evaluation of the relevant susy mixing angles and in a detail of the actual calculation of the decay amplitude .",
    "+ we find that the susy mixing angle between the second and the third generation has been over - estimated by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "we also find a difference in the result for the amplitude which can be traced back to the omission in previous papers of the diagrams involving a helicity flip in the gluino line , which dominate the branching ratios when the gluino mass gets large .",
    "+ the signal for the case where the susy breaking is universal turns out too low to be detectable .",
    "+ in the non - universal case , where the soft susy breaking is not flavour blind , the branching ratio can be as high as @xmath8 , which is maybe detectable . in this case the contributions from intermediate chargino exchange with respect to gluino exchange can be generally neglected . in section 2",
    "we review briefly those aspects of the mssm which are relevant for fcnc . in section 3",
    "we present the details of the calculation .",
    "the last section is devoted to the presentation of the results and to the conclusions .",
