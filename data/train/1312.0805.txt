    "the design of metamaterials with unusual effective properties with respect to natural materials has driven a large amount of research for about a decade .",
    "metamaterials , defined as materials with engineered properties , were first conceived to achieve specific macroscopic electromagnetic and optical behaviors not readily occurring in nature @xcite .",
    "driven by the mathematical analogy between acoustic and electromagnetic waves , researchers have been looking more recently for acoustic counterparts of these systems : linear acoustic metamaterials with negative effective young s modulus or mass density have produced interesting acoustic behaviors , showing many promises for engineering applications @xcite . in particular",
    ", some of these systems can prevent the propagation of harmonic waves , behaving like super absorbers with a transmission coefficient close to zero in some range of frequencies @xcite . even though such band gaps can be chosen adequately by tuning the metamaterial microstructure @xcite , wave mitigation is usually only efficient in a limited range of frequencies . as a result , these systems are relevant for some specific types of incident acoustic waves and might be inappropriate for absorbing impacts or complex excitations that generate a broad spectrum of harmonic waves .    to overcome this difficulty , we use here a nonlinear acoustic medium as a building brick for the design of an efficient absorber . in the networks of granular chains like the one shown on fig .",
    "[ description ] , the acoustic energy can propagate only through highly nonlinear waves with prescribed properties imposed by the bead properties @xcite  the only variable parameter of these solitary waves is their total acoustic energy that governs their force amplitude , their traveling velocity , etc ... this allows us to control and manipulate the transport of mechanical energy in the system .",
    "following this idea , we have designed an acoustic metamaterial supporting only non - linear solitary waves that produces a robust acoustic response , independent of the nature of the incident wave and capable of efficiently mitigating complex dynamic excitations .",
    "in addition , we take advantage of the network structure of granular materials to guide acoustic waves along predefined paths , and split , recombine and redirect waves as desired using an engineered network of granular chains without dissipating energy within the shielding system .",
    "in particular , we show that wave splitting is extremely efficient for mitigating acoustic waves , without calling for the dissipative processes usually present in most of acoustic media  the effect of which will actually sum up with the mitigation produced by wave splitting .",
    "additionally , we compare the performance of the granular networks with that of a non - dispersive continuum media , which clearly demonstrates the system efficiency in mitigating .    here , both the nonlinear response and the underlying branched structure of the granular networks are used to produce highly stress mitigating and robust metamaterials .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the designed network is investigated using a hybrid experimental and theoretical approach .",
    "in particular , we use the theoretical framework describing solitary waves pioneered by @xcite to predict quantitatively wave propagation through the metamaterial , and bridge the network geometry with its effective acoustic properties .",
    "extensive studies @xcite have shown that uncompressed chains of spheres support traveling solitary waves , the behavior of which can be elegantly predicted using the so - called quasi - particle model based on energy and momentum conservation @xcite . here",
    ", we use this approach to derive the transmission coefficients required to describe wave propagation through the bends and junctions of the granular network .",
    "these findings serve as elementary bricks to predict the evolution of the main pulse amplitude traveling through the network as well as the spatial repartition of transmitted waves in the output branches ( see fig .",
    "[ description ] ) .",
    "both the central leading pulse and the spatial repartition of the transmitted waves are shown to decay exponentially with the propagation distance and the distance to the central axis , respectively .",
    "this behavior is then studied on experimental realizations of this system and compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "the fast decay of the acoustic energy observed in these types of media suggests that ordered granular networks might be extremely relevant as impact mitigating materials .",
    "beyond the applications of these microstructured materials as acoustic shields , ordered networks of granular chains might serve as a model system to investigate the acoustic properties of natural granular piles , even though these are intrinsically disordered .",
    "continuum mechanics approaches clearly fail to provide a reliable model of wave propagation in granular matters ( see for example @xcite ) , due to the large force inhomogeneities present in stationary bead packs . indeed , in disordered granular assemblies , acoustic waves are transmitted along force chains with preferential directions based on the inter - particle contact network resulting from the static force transmission @xcite .",
    "a variety of studies have revealed this unique wave transmission pathway @xcite . as a result ,",
    "understanding wave propagation through networks of granular chains is the key to capture the acoustic behavior of granular matter , relevant in various applications of geophysics , soil mechanics , materials science , etc ... studies of wave propagation through y - branched granular chains @xcite have provided a quantitative description of the elementary mechanism of wave splitting in granular packings . however , an understanding of the effective acoustic response of granular chain networks that involve multiple wave splittings , recombinations and reflections is still missing .",
    "the study of ordered granular arrays that allow for a rigorous treatment of the wave evolution aims at addressing such questions .",
    "the observations in uncompressed disordered packings of ( i ) an exponential decay of the wave amplitude with the distance of propagation @xcite ( ii ) and the spatio - temporal structure of the transmitted wave packet consisting of a leading pulse followed by a train of slower pulses @xcite , similar to our observations on ordered arrangement of grains as reported in this study , suggest that both systems share strong similarities and support the relevance of our approach .    in the following , we present the experimental , numerical and theoretical tools used to investigate wave propagation in ordered networks of granular chains with different branching levels @xmath0 ( sections [ experimental setup ] , [ numerical simulations ] and [ quasi - particle theory ] , respectively ) .",
    "the next section presents the main features of wave propagation through ordered granular chain networks as observed in experiments and simulations , and compares these findings with theoretical predictions based on the description of the multiple wave splittings and recombinations in the network .",
    "finally , the last section discusses the relevance of our findings for the design of efficient shielding metamaterials and for the understanding of acoustic properties of granular media .",
    "the approaches used in this paper are general , and could be used to design different stress wave - guiding materials , for example , to focus impact energy instead of spreading it . the good agreement between experiments and both numerical simulations and theoretical predictions of the nonlinear wave propagation",
    "validates the proposed approaches , and suggests that more complex material designs with intricate predetermined wave propagation pathways can be experimentally feasible .    , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and corresponds to n=1 up to n=4 levels structures .",

    "in order to study the effect of multiple wave splittings on the overall acoustic response of a granular medium , the granular network tested in our experiments is comprised of an initial segment that divides into two symmetric branches .",
    "each new branch is then split into two symmetric branches , that can merge with other branches of the network ( see fig . [ description ] ) . this process is repeated @xmath0 times , in order to produce a network of degree @xmath0 that consists of @xmath5 exit chains where the transmitted wave can be measured .",
    "contrary to `` classical '' disordered granular media , the deterministic arrangement of granular chains allows for a rigorous description of the wave propagation and scattering within the network from which the effective acoustic response will be predicted ( see section [ quasi - particle theory ] ) .",
    "the initial segment consists of 10 spheres to allow an incident solitary wave to develop .",
    "the branching angle was chosen to minimize losses of the incident wave due to wave reflection , so that wave splitting remains the main mitigation mechanism .",
    "as the branch angle @xmath6 increases , the loss around the corners continues to increase until no force is transmitted for @xmath7 ( see section [ quasi - particle theory ] ) .",
    "however , a lower limit @xmath8 exists , at which point the spheres on either side of the branching junctions come into contact . to guarantee clearance between neighboring particles at branch junctions within the assembly , @xmath9 was chosen for all experimentally tested networks . in order to minimize dissipative losses along the length of the chains , each branching segment consisted of 6 spheres , which is sufficient to support the solitary wave length of approximately 5 particle diameters @xcite .",
    "the tested granular networks consist of spheres ( precision ball bearings from mcmaster - carr ) assembled in the supporting channel structures .",
    "the spheres are stainless steel ( type 420c ) with diameter , @xmath10 mm .",
    "the particle size and material used for experiments was chosen to simplify the experimental setup .",
    "however , the analysis described in sections [ quasi - particle theory ] and [ results ] is valid for a homogeneous network of any size or material particles .",
    "the supporting channel structures are fabricated using veroclear material with the connex 500 3d printing system .    in order to investigate the effect of multiple splittings through a granular network",
    ", individual channel structures were printed for networks of various degrees , from @xmath11 up to @xmath12 .",
    "let us note that the case @xmath11 corresponding to y - branched granular systems have been investigated in several works @xcite , providing a detailed description of the wave splitting mechanism .",
    "precise alignment of the spheres in each network is crucial to ensure simultaneous arrival of pulses at branch junctions and observe recombinations of solitary waves in experiments .",
    "the supporting channel structures were fabricated with a v - shaped cross section ( see the inset in fig . [ exp_setup](b ) ) to support and align the spheres and to reduce the number of contact points between the spheres and their support .",
    "a v - shaped cross section is less reliant on the exact dimensions of the supporting channel , since the particles will always rest at the same height along the centerline of the v , assuming a constant v - profile through the length .",
    "a square channel or a tube , for example , could have also been used instead of the v - shaped channel , however the dimension of these cross - sections would need to be very accurate : if too small , the particle motion would be severely impeded , and if too wide , the alignment of the sphere centers would be skewed . a slight tilt ( approximately @xmath13 )",
    "was induced on the experimental assembly to promote particle contacts in the network .",
    "additionally , asymmetries within the granular network could arise by including sensor particles ( similar to @xcite ) within the branches .",
    "therefore , force measurements were taken at each of the branch ends with piezoelectric dynamic force sensors ( pcb 208c01 and pcb 208c02 , with sensitivity @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and an upper frequency response of 36khz ) .",
    "a conditioner ( pcb 481a02 ) amplified signals when necessary and the data was collected through a data acquisition board ( ni bnc-2110 and ni pci-6123 ) .  the force between the last particle and a flat sensor will be higher than contact forces between particles in the chain , since the sphere - sensor stiffness is greater than the sphere - sphere stiffness .",
    "a previous study by job et al . provides a general expression for the relative solitary wave amplitude in a chain of beads with respect to the amplitude between the last bead in contact with a wall , in terms of the bead and wall materials . using the theoretical prediction described by @xcite ,",
    "the arriving solitary wave amplitude in the branches contacting the sensors can be calculated as @xmath16 , for the stainless steel spheres and stainless steel impact cap used in experiments .",
    "the assembled systems were excited by a single striker sphere , identical to the spheres in the network .",
    "the striker sphere was given an initial velocity with a solenoid mechanism ( see fig .",
    "[ exp_setup](a ) ) .",
    "to capture the variability between experiments , each network with @xmath11 to @xmath12 was disassembled and reassembled five times , with five impacts on each initial assembly .",
    "the incident solitary wave amplitude was determined to be @xmath17 , based on repeated impacts of an @xmath18 system consisting of 10 spheres .",
    "this average impacting force corresponds to a striker velocity of @xmath19 , based on numerical simulations .",
    "however , the analysis performed in sections [ quasi - particle theory ] and [ results ] is relevant for all impact forces , which are within the linear elastic response of the material . in experiments",

    "the remarkable ability of granular chain networks to efficiently mitigate the acoustic energy of the largest wave in the system emerges from their branched structure . due to the underlying branched structure , the spatial distribution of acoustic energy is also fundamentally different than the wave front energy distribution through a conventional continuum material ( see fig .",
    "[ continuum ] ) . in a non - dissipative 2d elastic",
    "medium , the elastic energy density of a harmonic wave is shown to decay as @xmath156 with the distance @xmath0 from a localized excitation , invoking energy conservation .",
    "more generally , a power law decay of the elastic energy is expected for either linear or nonlinear acoustic media .",
    "similarly , the wave spatial structure at a distance @xmath0 follows a power law behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ continuum ] ( top ) .",
    "conversely , the granular chain network exhibits a drastically faster decay of the energy carried in the leading pulse : exponential decay of both the central leading pulse with propagation distance and the spatial repartition of the transmitted wave with the distance to the central axis ( fig .",
    "[ continuum ] ( bottom ) ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions also indicate that the exponential decay occurs over relatively short length scales .",
    "specifically , the values of the decay length scales @xmath89 and @xmath128 suggest that the @xmath105 network is already a highly effective acoustic wave mitigating structure . to better understand the importance of the nonlinear dynamic response in the wave mitigating properties of our system , we also compare our granular network with its static response and , similarly , with the dynamic response of a linear elastic solid network ( fig .",
    "[ continuum ] ) .    if we consider a static load applied to the input branch , because of the symmetry of our system , the compressive forces in each segment can be calculated assuming an even force splitting at all nodes .",
    "the static forces carried by each branch will be largest in the center of the system and decrease with increasing n , and decrease with increasing perpendicular distance r. for the studied network geometry , we can write a general expression for the maximum member force as well as for the smallest ( side or r=0.5 ) force . @xmath157 while the side branch force decays exponentially , the middle ( largest ) force decays with a rate between linear and exponential , as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the static response of our granular network structures is the same as a branched network composed of any homogeneous solid media .",
    "however , the dynamic response of a homogeneous solid network does not differ from its static response in terms of relative force transmission , assuming a linear elastic , non - dispersive media , and neglecting complexities such as edge effects .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that the exponential decay in the largest leading pulse in our granular network is a result of the structured branching geometry in combination with the nonlinear dynamic response of our system ( fig .",
    "[ continuum ] ) .",
    "the analytical procedure presented here is general , and could be used to describe more complex systems with any combination of material properties and sizes in adjacent branches . in a more general system , the transmission coefficients , and therefore overall effective response , would also depend on the particle sizes and material properties .",
    "the presented network structure is not intended to be the most efficient granular network . on the contrary",
    ", we study a simplified ( i.e. symmetric and homogeneous ) network , in order to provide and validate a method for designing more complex granular network structures .",
    "for example , chains of different materials could be introduced within the network to tune the wave velocity and prevent pulse recombinations and to increase the ratio of reflected to transmitted wave amplitudes .",
    "previous studies have shown that adding variable particle sizes or material properties within 1d bead chains can be used to significantly reduce the incident pulse @xcite . additionally , a honeycomb structure could be designed to produce mitigating behavior when the system is excited from either the left or right side .",
    "an additional benefit of the granular networks is the low effective density compared to a conventional bulk material . here , we study the propagation of a single incident pules . however , one of the attractive wave mitigating features of granular chains is that they naturally break up large or long duration excitations into a series of smaller pulses spread in time , by opening gaps between particles ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the entrance chain of our network could be used to break up a shock like excitations , subsequently each pulse resulting from the impact would be further reduced as it propagates through the network .",
    "such a system could also be impacted with much larger forces . however , one of the benefits of the proposed granular structure is its reversible deformation , a feature that would be lost for high force impacts , but with the trade off of increased force mitigation resulting from the plastic deformation .",
    "such techniques could be incorporated into our network structure to further improve the force mitigating properties .    beyond these interests for engineering applications ,",
    "our model system also provides new insights into wave propagation in disordered granular media .",
    "the dynamic behavior of granular materials is not well understood , yet it plays an important role in many areas of industry and research ranging from agriculture and construction to modeling earthquakes and avalanches . in tightly packed granular media , several previous studies showed that the dynamic force transmission occurs along force chains @xcite , following preferred loading paths within the contact network .",
    "@xcite suggest that these granular chain network comes from the static force chains widely observed in granular packings at rest @xcite .",
    "our system contains all the relevant ingredients to capture the physics of wave propagation though force chain networks : wave splitting , bending , and recombination . as a result",
    ", we expect the ordered granular network presented here to qualitatively capture the behavior of disordered granular media . in terms of effective acoustic response",
    ", the exponential mitigation of the wave amplitude identified in this study for ordered granular packings is also observed in disordered packings @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spatio - temporal structure of the wave transmitted through ordered and disordered granular media shares qualitatively many common features : after a dominant leading pulse that has been the main focus of our study , we also observe a train of smaller solitary waves resulting from wave propagation through alternative and less direct paths ( see @xcite for similar observations in random packings ) .",
    "interestingly , due to pulse recombinations , it is not impossible to observe that the largest transmitted pulse is actually not the leading one for some special network configurations , as also reported for random networks",
    ". let us note that dissipation present in real systems will affect the actual rate of mitigation . comparing our dissipative experiments with the conservative numerical simulations , we observed that the rate of mitigation due to wave splitting and dissipation are of the same order for the short branch networks .",
    "this ingredient should also be included in a realistic model of wave propagation in natural granular materials . finally ,",
    "since our granular chain system was perfectly ordered , we could investigate its properties analytically , and relate its property at the microstructure scale ( branching angle and particle geometry ) with its macroscopic acoustic behavior ( @xmath86 and @xmath114 ) . in our experiments ,",
    "the particle alignment was crucial in order to validate the predicted properties for the specific network geometry chosen .",
    "however , future studies involving branched systems that incorporate random orientations and chain lengths would help to improve our understanding of the acoustic transmission through disordered force chain networks and identify the main differences with ordered networks .",
    "we could , for example , calculate an effective disordered network geometry , and subsequently use the effective geometry to predict the disordered system response . or , perhaps an effective chain length and branching angle can be established , based on the level of disorder , which could then be used to describe an effective acoustic behavior of disordered networks using a similar theoretical approach as for the ordered network .",
    "such future studies would help elucidate the role of disorder in the wave mitigation capabilities of granular media .",
    "we studied the transmission of elastic waves through ordered granular chain networks with variable branch angles .",
    "we identified three main physical mechanisms involved during this process : wave splitting , wave bending through corners , and wave recombination at merging junctions .",
    "solitary wave splitting was previously observed @xcite , however , we present the first observation and theoretical description of two identical solitary waves combining .",
    "the quasi - particle theory was used to describe these mechanisms , and derive the effective acoustic properties of the granular acoustic metamaterial from the geometrical properties of the network and the bead properties .",
    "numerical simulations for long branch networks up to branching level @xmath106 are in good quantitative agreement with our theoretical approach for both the exponential decay of the central leading pulse with propagation distance and the spatial repartition of the transmitted wave with the distance to the central axis .",
    "experiments and numerical simulations of a short branch system for @xmath0 up to 4 are also in good qualitative agreement with the predicted exponential decay of the leading central pulse amplitude and the spatial repartition of the leading pulses along @xmath4 .",
    "however , the short branch system does not always provide a long enough propagation distance for leading and trailing pulses to separate , and pulse overlapping results in an increased wave amplitude compared to the quasi - particle predictions which only account for the leading pulses . additionally , the effects of dissipation present in experiments reduce the leading pulse amplitude faster than in our theoretical model .",
    "overall , the exponential decay of leading pulse amplitudes through the ordered granular network makes these systems ideally suited for wave mitigation applications .",
    "perhaps most importantly , the good agreement between experiments and both numerical simulations and theoretical predictions suggests that more complex designs with controllable wave propagation pathways should also be experimentally feasible .",
    "furthermore , the exponential decay of wave amplitude with propagation distance in our ordered granular network compares well with the wave propagation features along force chains in disordered granular media @xcite .",
    "this ordered version of natural granular materials offers the possibility to understand in all its details the acoustic behavior of a granular medium and ( i ) relate microstructural characteristics with effective acoustic properties in this type of materials and ( ii ) choose adequately the material microstructure to achieve desired acoustic response like a high mitigation rate .",
