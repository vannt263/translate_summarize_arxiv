    "the nuclear energy density functional approach is the many - body method of choice in order to calculate the properties of medium - mass and heavy nuclei in a systematic manner @xcite .",
    "parameterized non - relativistic skyrme functionals @xcite as well as relativistic mean - field models @xcite have been widely and successfully used for such nuclear structure calculations . a complementary approach",
    "@xcite focuses less on the fitting of experimental data , but attempts to constrain the analytical form of the functional and the values of its couplings from many - body perturbation theory and the underlying two- and three - nucleon interaction .",
    "switching from conventional hard - core nn - potentials to low - momentum interactions @xcite is essential in this respect , because the nuclear many - body problem formulated in terms of the latter becomes significantly more perturbative . indeed , second - order perturbative calculations including also three - body forces give already a good account of the bulk correlations in infinite nuclear matter @xcite and in doubly - magic nuclei @xcite .    in many - body perturbation theory the contributions to the energy",
    "are written in terms of density - matrices convoluted with the finite - range interaction kernels , and are therefore highly non - local in both space and time . in order to make such functionals numerically tractable in heavy open - shell nuclei",
    "it is desirable to develop simplified approximations for these functionals in terms of local densities and currents only .",
    "in such a construction the density - matrix expansion comes prominently into play as it removes the non - local character of the exchange ( fock ) contribution to the energy by mapping it onto a generalized skyrme functional with density - dependent couplings . for some time",
    "the prototype for that has been the density - matrix expansion of negele and vautherin @xcite , but recently gebremariam , duguet and bogner @xcite have developed an improved version for spin - unsaturated nuclei .",
    "they have demonstrated that phase - space averaging techniques allow for a consistent expansion of both the spin - independent ( scalar ) part as well as the spin - dependent ( vector ) part of the density - matrix .",
    "the improved properties of the new phase - space averaged density - matrix expansion have been extensively studied via the fock energy densities arising from schematic finite - range central , tensor and spin - orbit interactions for a large set of semi - magic nuclei ( for further details see ref.@xcite ) .    in order to match with these new developments , the nuclear energy density",
    "functional as it emerges from chiral pion - nucleon dynamics has been recalculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "this calculation has treated for isospin - symmetric ( i.e. @xmath5 ) nuclear systems the effects from @xmath6-exchange , iterated @xmath6-exchange , and irreducible @xmath7-exchange with intermediate @xmath8-isobar excitations , including pauli - blocking corrections up to three - loop order . among other things",
    ", it has been found that the two- and three - body contributions to the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath3 , as generated by @xmath7-exchange , tend to cancel each other in the relevant density range @xmath9@xmath10 , thus leaving room for the short - range nuclear spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the short - range components of the nn - interaction together with the constraints on them provided by the elastic scattering data ( i.e. nn - phase shifts etc . ) have not been considered explicitly in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a similar calculation of a microscopically constrained nuclear energy density functional derived from the chiral nn - potential at next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath11lo ) has been presented recently by gebremariam , bogner and duguet in ref.@xcite .",
    "they have proposed that the density - dependent couplings associated with the pion - exchange interactions should be added to a standard skyrme functional ( with several adjustable parameters ) . in the sequel",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite that this new energy density functional gives numerically stable results and that it exhibits a small but systematic reduction of the @xmath12-measure compared to standard skyrme functionals ( without any pion - exchange terms ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive a nuclear energy density functional with improved ( chiral ) two- and three - nucleon interactions .",
    "we use for the two - body interaction the n@xmath13lo chiral nn - potential which reaches at this order the quality of a high - precision nn - potential ( in reproducing empirical nn - shifts and deuteron properties ) .",
    "the n@xmath13lo chiral potential consists of long - range one- and two - pion exchange terms and two dozen low - energy constants which parameterize the short - distance part of the nn - interaction .",
    "the latter contact potential written in momentum space gives the most general contribution up to fourth power in momenta . in the actual calculation we will use the version n@xmath13low of the chiral nn - potential developed in refs.@xcite by lowering the cut - off scale to @xmath14mev",
    "this value coincides with the resolution scale inherent to the universal low - momentum nn - potential @xmath15 @xcite to which all realistic nn - potentials flow after integrating out effects from momenta above the cut - off scale @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "the low - momentum two - body interaction n@xmath13low is supplemented by the leading order chiral three - nucleon interaction with its parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath1 determined in calculations of nuclear few - body systems @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the basic features of the ( improved ) density - matrix expansion and the nuclear energy density functional for isospin - symmetric systems . in section 3",
    "we present the two - body contributions to the various density - dependent strength functions @xmath4 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath3 and @xmath22 , separately for the finite - range pion - exchange and the zero - range contact interactions . in section 4 , we collect the corresponding analytical expressions for the three - body contributions grouped into contact ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath6-exchange ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath7-exchange ( @xmath1 ) terms .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion of our numerical results and sections 6 ends with a summary and an outlook .",
    "the starting point for the construction of an explicit nuclear energy density functional is the density - matrix as given by a sum over the energy eigenfunctions @xmath23 representing occupied orbitals of the ( non - relativistic ) many - fermion system . according to gebremariam , duguet and bogner @xcite it can be expanded in relative and center - of - mass coordinates , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as follows : @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { 3i \\over 2a k_f } \\,j_1(a k_f)\\ , \\vec \\sigma \\cdot ( \\vec a \\times \\vec j\\ , ) + \\dots\\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the spherical bessel function @xmath27 .",

    ". the pronounced increase of the two - body contribution ( dash - dotted line ) at very low densities is caused by the @xmath6-exchange and has also been observed in other calculations @xcite .",
    "the sizeable three - body contribution ( dashed line ) adds negatively to these initial values such that the total result for @xmath2 ( shown by the full line in fig.10 ) decreases with increasing density @xmath167 . for comparison",
    "we have also included the band ( of constant @xmath179-values ) spanned by phenomenological skyrme forces @xcite . taking this as a benchmark one sees that our hartree - fock result is somewhat too small at densities around @xmath180@xmath10 , where the surface energy in nuclei gains most of its weight .",
    "the calculation of the iterated @xmath6-exchange in ref.@xcite suggests that a treatment of the low - momentum two - body interaction to second order will further increase the values of @xmath2 .    of particular interest",

    "the two- and three - body contributions together with their total sum are shown in fig.11 .",
    "the two - body part is dominated by the low - energy constant @xmath181 as indicated also by the weak variation of the dash - dotted line with density @xmath167 .",
    "the induced ( density - dependent ) three - body spin - orbit forces add sizeably to this initial value .",
    "the major contribution is provided by the hartree term in eq.(23 ) proportional to @xmath164gev@xmath145 . with this given value of @xmath123",
    "it is considerably larger than the @xmath147-excitation mechanism proposed by fujita and miyazawa @xcite which corresponds to @xmath182gev@xmath145 ( with @xmath183mev the delta - nucleon mass splitting ) . at densities around @xmath184@xmath10 where the spin - orbit interaction in nuclei receives most of its weight , our total hartree - fock result overshoots the empirical spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath185mev@xmath186 @xcite by about @xmath187",
    "this requires a compensating effect , and indeed it has been found in ref.@xcite that the second - order @xmath6-exchange tensor force generates a spin - orbit coupling of the  wrong - sign  . taking the value @xmath188mev@xmath186 ( see fig.5 in ref.@xcite ) as indicative one can expect that the second - order effects from the low - momentum two - nucleon tensor potential will reduce the strength of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath3 to the correct amount .     multiplying the squared spin - orbit density @xmath189 versus @xmath167 . ]    finally , we show in fig.12 the strength function @xmath22 of the squared spin - orbit density @xmath189 in the nuclear energy density functional @xmath190 $ ] .",
    "in contrast to all previous quantities , @xmath22 receives only a very small three - body contribution . on the other hand",
    "the two - body contribution is strongly density - dependent and it reaches quite large values at low densities .",
    "this prominent feature of @xmath22 has also been observed in previous calculations @xcite .",
    "actually , the strong density dependence of @xmath22 originates from the dominant @xmath6-exchange contribution which we reproduce separately in fig.12 by the upper dash - dotted line ( for an explicit formula for @xmath191 , see eq.(11 ) in ref.@xcite ) . at this point",
    "it should be kept in mind that the @xmath189-term in the nuclear energy density functional represents the non - local fock contributions from tensor forces etc .",
    "an outstanding @xmath6-exchange contribution to the strength function @xmath22 is therefore not surprising .",
    "in this work we have used the ( improved ) density - matrix expansion of ref.@xcite to calculate the nuclear energy density functional from chiral two- and three - nucleon interactions .",
    "we have employed the low - momentum nn - potential n@xmath13low @xcite which is composed of long - range multi - pion exchanges and a set of short - distance contact terms .",
    "the coefficients of the latter have been determined in fits to empirical nn - phase shifts .",
    "the leading order chiral three - nucleon interaction has been taken with its parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 fixed in calculations of nuclear few - body systems @xcite . with this input the nuclear energy density functional @xmath49 $ ] has been derived to first order in many - body perturbation theory , i.e. in the hartree - fock approximation . for the effective nucleon mass @xmath38 and the strength functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the surface and spin - orbit terms",
    "we have found ( in the relevant density range ) reasonable agreement with results of phenomenological skyrme forces .",
    "however , as indicated in particular by the nuclear matter equation of state @xmath4 , an improved description of the energy density functional requires at least the treatment of the two - nucleon interaction to second order in many - body perturbation theory . it is furthermore expected that tensor forces at second - order generate an additional  wrong - sign  spin - orbit coupling @xcite which compensates part of the strong three - body contribution to @xmath3 .",
    "such a consistent second - order calculation of the nuclear energy density functional represents a challenge , since a satisfactory generalization of the density - matrix expansion @xcite to that situation has not yet been formulated . at second order one must properly account for the presence of energy denominators which induce further spatial and temporal non - localities and possibly even an orbital dependence of the resulting energy density functional . in a first simplified approach",
    "one could follow ref.@xcite and approximate the energy denominators by the kinetic energies of free ( on - shell ) nucleons , eventually improved by the inclusion of an effective nucleon mass @xmath38 . in order to keep the second - order calculation manageable and in order to see leading effects , one would also restrict the low - momentum two - nucleon interaction to some dominant components , such as one - pion exchange with a suitable regularization of its strong tensor force at short distances .",
    "studies along this line are underway .",
    "we thank r. machleidt for providing us the code for elastic nn - scattering with the chiral potential n@xmath13low .",
