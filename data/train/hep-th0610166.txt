    "planar domain wall networks in theories with three or more vacua have been investigated in a series of papers , @xcite .",
    "domain walls seem to have various applications especially in d - brane theories , @xcite .    the idea of 3-dimensional networks on spherical surfaces has been established in @xcite and applied to the spherical surface of a  large \" soliton star , @xcite .",
    " large \" soliton stars were investigated in a series of papers by friedberg _",
    "et al _ , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was found that there exist stable with respect to fission into free particles field configurations , corresponding to soliton stars , with a domain wall network on their surface . the pressure of the soliton acts as a stabilizing force to the domain wall network .",
    "the star mass is , in general , slightly larger in the presence of the above network , when the particle number and the radius show a more complicated behavior , depending on the surface tension , the particle number etc . in @xcite",
    "it was discussed the entrapment of domain wall network on the surface of a soliton of any kind in the absence of gravity . in the same article",
    ", another kind of  stability \" was discussed , namely the stability of the domain walls .",
    "it was found that only two of the five platonic solids , cube and octahedron , can be realized on a spherical surface .",
    "networks forming other solids would collapse to a single vacuum .",
    "so , from now on , when discussing domain walls we restrict ourselves to these two solids .    in the present article",
    "we investigate the properties of q - stars @xcite , which are relativistic generalizations of q - balls , @xcite , that seem to play a special role in baryogenesis through flat directions of supersymmetric extensions of standard model , @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to find numerical solutions to the coupled einstein - scalar fields equations , and to calculate the mass , radius , particle number , and the value of the scalar field at the center of the soliton in the whole phase space .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained in the absence of the domain wall network , including in our figures the relevant results , and to the results of @xcite , referring to the other family of solitonic stars , and @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the soliton stability with respect to gravitational collapse and to decay to free particles .",
    "we consider a complex scalar field , @xmath0 , with a global @xmath1 symmetry and a suitable potential @xmath2 , coupled to a complex scalar field , @xmath3 , able to generate a network of domain walls , and to gravity . in order",
    "the @xmath3 field to be able to generate a domain - wall network , a @xmath4 term should be included in the action , where @xmath5 is a constant , @xcite . the action of the above configuration is : @xmath6\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 stands for the ( negative or zero ) cosmological constant and the constants @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be determined later , @xmath11 is an integer and @xmath12 is a positive constant that can be absorbed in @xmath3 and does not affect the solutions . a lagrangian with a potential of the form : @xmath13 admits solutions corresponding to a domain wall network . in our case",
    "we choose : @xmath14 the field configuration is spherically symmetric , so we can choose a spherically symmetric metric : @xmath15 we define : @xmath16 and make the following rescalings : @xmath17 with @xmath18 a very small quantity for @xmath19 .",
    "quantities of the same order of magnitude as @xmath20 can be neglected .",
    "we also choose a rescaled potential : @xmath21 where we dropped tildes for simplicity .",
    "we will now determine the proper values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 regarding at present @xmath22 .",
    "gravity becomes important when @xmath23 .",
    "if we regard that the scalar field @xmath24 varies very slowly with respect to the radial coordinate then @xmath25 if we set @xmath26 .",
    "so , the euler - lagrange equation for the scalar field , dropping the tildes and the @xmath27 quantities gives : @xmath28 the eigenvalue equation for the frequency can be obtained by integrating the equation of motion within the surface , where the scalar field varies rapidly from a @xmath29 value at the inner edge of the surface , to a zero value at the outer edge .",
    "the result of integration is : @xmath30 which , in order to match with the interior solution , for which @xmath31 , gives for the eigen - frequency : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 denote the value of the metrics at the surface of the star . in the absence of gravity @xmath35 and , as one can find from eqs .",
    "[ 7 ] and [ 9 ] , @xmath36 .",
    "when gravity is under consideration the situation is not too different , unless @xmath37 . when @xmath38 the star collapses to a black hole . excluding this case and regarding only stars in our discussion",
    ", we can set @xmath39 , which means that , the quantity @xmath40 is zero inside and outside the soliton .",
    "the only region within which this quantity differs form zero is the very thin surface .",
    "the maximum value is at @xmath41 so we set : @xmath42 and the above quantity takes its proper maximum value : @xmath43 . with these settings",
    "the field @xmath3 is exactly zero outside the soliton , approximately zero in the interior and maximum within the surface .    ,",
    "included for comparison .",
    "the numbers within the figures denote the value of the cosmological constant @xmath7 .",
    "the true cosmological constant is @xmath44 , according to eq .",
    "[ 6 ] . ]                 curves . ]     holds . ]",
    "we will now turn on the interactions between the two scalar fields .",
    "let @xmath45 so as to treat the additional interaction as a perturbation , which does not disturb significantly the system .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath0 field , dropping the @xmath27 quantities gives : @xmath46 the exact solution in the above equation is rather long and ugly , but if we substitute the value @xmath36 ( holding true when @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) in the @xmath49 combination , we find for @xmath50 : @xmath51 which has the right limiting value for @xmath52 according to the eq .",
    "[ 7 ] . integrating again the equation of motion within the surface ,",
    "we find that the eigenvalue equation for the frequency , eq . [ 9 ] , remains valid .    within the soliton ,",
    "the @xmath3 field is approximately zero .",
    "so , the total energy - momentum tensor is approximately the energy - momentum tensor for the @xmath0 field , which takes the form : @xmath53 -g_{\\mu\\nu}u\\ .\\ ] ]    the einstein equations are @xmath54 .",
    "the independent components , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , take the following form , dropping the tildes and the @xmath27 quantities : @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath24 is given by eq .",
    "the mass of the field configuration is given by the relation : @xmath61 the particle number is defined as : @xmath62 with : @xmath63 for the interior , we take for the particle number : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radius of the q - star",
    ".    we will now prove that the energy and particle number contributions form the thin surface are negligible . at the exterior ,",
    "the @xmath0 field is exactly zero , and consequently the @xmath3 field is zero , and , thus , no energy or particle number contribution arises from the exterior .",
    "the surface is of width of order @xmath66 . for the moment we ignore our rescalings . within the surface @xmath67 and consequently @xmath68 .",
    "also , the field @xmath0 varies from a certain value at the inner edge of the surface to a zero value at the outer , so @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath71 .",
    "because @xmath72 , then @xmath73 .",
    "because @xmath74 , then @xmath75 , which means that within the surface @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath3 field contributes to the total energy through the @xmath77 terms of potential energy and the kinetic terms .",
    "the energy density arising from the @xmath77 terms are of the same order of magnitude as @xmath78 .",
    "if we repeat the discussion concerning the kinetic terms for the @xmath0 field , the kinetic terms for the @xmath3 field are of the same order of magnitude as @xmath78 .",
    "so , the total energy density from the surface ( potential for both fields , kinetic from the temporal variation from the field @xmath0 and kinetic from the spatial variation from both fields ) is @xmath79 and the total energy stored within the surface is @xmath80 . within the interior",
    "the energy density is @xmath79 and the total energy is @xmath81 .",
    "one can see that @xmath82 and thus the contribution of the surface to the total energy is negligible .",
    "the same discussion holds true for the particle number contribution of the surface .",
    "these steps reproduce the similar discussion holding true in the case of a  pure \" q - star without any additional fields in the total action .",
    "we numerically solve equations [ 13 ] and [ 14 ] with boundary conditions @xmath83 , @xmath84 and find the parameters of the q - star using relations [ 15]-[18 ] and [ 11 ] .",
    "in the present work we investigated the formation of q - stars with a domain wall network on their surface .",
    "all the field configurations are stable with respect to fission into free particles because the energy of the free particles with the same charge is smaller than the star mass .",
    "they are also stable with respect to gravitational collapse , as one can see from figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "we find that the radius , mass and particle number of the q - star are slightly larger when domain walls are trapped on the star surface .",
    "these results agrees with the estimation of @xcite , concerning the total energy of the soliton .",
    "radius and particle number of  large \" soliton stars , investigated in @xcite show a more complicated dependence on @xmath77 , which is the new parameter differentiating the stars with domain walls from usual ,  large \" soliton stars .",
    "the results of larger radii and smaller values of the scalar field at the center of the star agree with the similar ones , obtained in @xcite , despite the absence of gravity .",
    "the same results hold true in asymptotically flat , as well as in asymptotically anti de sitter spacetime .",
    "unfortunately , one can not find an analytical relation connecting the mass and the particle number of the star , due to the highly non - linear character of the equations of motion .",
    "instead , we use our numerical results , depicted in figure [ figure6 ] , in order to study the behavior of the soliton mass as a function of its particle number . from figure [ figure6 ]",
    "one can see that our solutions are always stable with respect to fission into free particles , because the soliton energy is always smaller than the total energy of the free particles . for small values of the particle number ,",
    "gravity is negligible . in the absence of gravity and for a large soliton the so called thin - wall approximation holds .",
    "it has been shown that for such solitons @xmath85 plus some surface terms which are negligible in the above approximation , with @xmath86 .",
    "as one can see , for the potential [ 6 ] , @xmath87 equals to 0.5 .",
    "numerical results show clearly that , for small values of the particle number , when gravity is negligible , the ratio mass to particle number equals to @xmath87 . for larger values of the particle number gravity",
    "becomes more important and the negative potential energy contributed by the attractive gravitational force decreases the ratio @xmath88 to @xmath89 . from fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] we also see that the above ratio is larger for smaller values of the ( negative ) cosmological constant .",
    "this reflects the repulsive character of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the star decreases its mass so as to resist to the environment of the `` negative '' gravity induced by a negative cosmological constant",
