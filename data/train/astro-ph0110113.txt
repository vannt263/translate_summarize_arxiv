    "the small scale distribution of molecular species in translucent and opaque clouds is still poorly characterized as compared to structure in the atomic phase ( see the paper by j. lauroesch in these proceedings ) . to complement the scarce data available on minor tracers like h@xmath0co , oh , hco@xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", we have undertaken an observational program devoted to a simultaneous study of small scale variations in the column density of various molecular and atomic species , including the major ones , h@xmath0 and hi .",
    "a bright , large proper motion star , hd 34078 , has been selected for repeated observations in the far - uv with fuse , and in the visible range , at the observatoire de haute - provence . due to the large transverse velocity of this target ( 100km / s )",
    ", the line of sight is drifting through the foreground material ( e(b - v ) = 0.52 ) at a velocity of about 17 au / yr . thus , observations separated by an interval ranging from about one month to a few years provide information on structure at scales 1 - 50 au .",
    "further , hd 34078 has been the subject of detailed studies in the past and several high s / n and resolution spectra have been obtained ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . by comparison with our recent ones , scales as large as 200 au can then be probed for species like ch and ch@xmath1 .",
    "the main properties of the absorbing material along the sightline towards hd 34078 are discussed in le petit et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on absorption line @xmath2 and present a preliminary analysis of h@xmath0 features in the three fuse cycle 1 spectra and of the variations of visible ch and ch@xmath1 absorption lines .",
    "the fuse spectra were obtained in january 2000 , october 2000 and february 2001 .",
    "the data have been processed using the fuse pipeline software .",
    "individual exposures were co - added in a standard manner .",
    "for each epoch , the total integration time is about 6500s ; the s / n ratio reached in the lif1a data that we will use here is about 30 per 15 m  pixel .",
    "seven visible spectra were obtained between november 1999 and february 2001 at the observatoire de haute provence ( o.h.p . ) with the echelle spectrometer , elodie , mounted on the 1.93 m telescope .",
    "the spectral resolution is about 10km / s ; the typical s / n ratio is 150 per .03   pixel .",
    "a spacing of about one month was adopted first but since ch and ch@xmath1 lines looked quite stable , only two spectra were taken next winter .    in fuse spectra ,",
    "a large number of transitions are available to study column density variations but in fact , only a few of them are suitable for a sensitive search for variations .",
    "indeed , since profiles are not resolved by fuse , the equivalent width of lines falling on the flat part of the curve of growth are insensitive to n variations .",
    "the situation is favorable in two cases : a ) marginally thin lines ( 0.5 @xmath3 3 where @xmath4 is the opacity at line center ) and b ) damped lines . for species which are likely to display the same b value as ch ( about 3 km / s ) , case a ) corresponds to lines with w ranging from roughly 10 to 50 m .",
    "h@xmath0 lines from high excitation levels , ch and ch@xmath1 lines fall into this category .",
    "case b ) corresponds to ly@xmath5 or the strongest j = 0 , 1 , 2 h@xmath0 lines .",
    "it can be shown easily that the difference between two damped profiles is maximum where the normalised intensity equals 0.36 ; typically , for a 10% n variation , the expected difference is 0.04 .",
    "thus , a definite signature is expected for such lines , which should be easily detectable in good quality spectra if @xmath6n is large enough . obviously , some care has to be taken concerning instrumental effects which might induce apparent line variations but using several transitions from the same species or data from different fuse segments can be used to solve these potential difficulties .",
    "* h@xmath0 : * the first goal of our project is to estimate the fluctuations of the total h@xmath0 column density . we thus need to study lines from the j = 0 , 1 and 2 states .",
    "several damped lines originating from these levels and with good s / n profiles are present in our spectra .",
    "these features appear blended in systems but generally , the blue or red wing is primarily due to one specific transition ( for instance , in the system around 1050  shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the blue wing is due mostly to the j = 0 transition ) ; blends with other lines also restricts the range to be used . before comparing profiles from distinct epochs , we first adjust the wavelength scales by applying a uniform shift .",
    "second , we adjust the flux level in intervals free of absorption using one single multiplicative factor . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] profiles look extremely similar ; their difference shows no significant deviation from zero . for comparison ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the difference expected if n(j = 0 , 1 and 2 ) are varied by @xmath7 10% .",
    "our residuals are clearly well smaller ! we conclude that over the three epochs considered , a 2.5 @xmath8 upper limit on variations in n(j=0 and j=2 ) is 7% .",
    "this result suggests that n(h@xmath0 ) variations are smaller than those reported for h@xmath0co and oh .      for the highest excitation h@xmath0 levels detected , lines become close to optically thin and we recover a good sensitivity to variations .",
    "we find some evidence for variations with w(oct .",
    "2000 ) @xmath9 w(feb .",
    "2001 ) @xmath9 w(jan .",
    "for instance , in the region around 1046  , large variations are seen for a feature at 1046.45   that we tentatively assign to h@xmath0(v=4 , j=2 ) ; similarly , two features from h@xmath0 j=11 apparently show in the 2d and 3rd spectra a blueshift of about 10 km / s and a broader profile . by cross - correlating the behaviour of various lines from each level",
    ", we should be able to reach firm conclusions on the reality and magnitude of these variations . as discussed by le petit",
    "et al . in this volume",
    ", variable excited h@xmath0 lines could be due to instabilities in the shocked gas at the hd34078 s wind - ambient medium interface .",
    "* ch and ch@xmath1 : * no small scale variations are detected in our homogeneous set of ohp spectra .",
    "the excellent s / n reached on the ch4300 line allows us to set a 3 @xmath8 limit on relative column density fluctuations @xmath6n / n @xmath10 6% for scales in the range 1 - 20au .",
    "thus , we do not find evidence for the kind of ubiquitous structure seen for oh and h@xmath0co @xcite .",
    "however , comparing our results with those obtained several years ago ( @xcite , federman , private communication , @xcite ) , we find that w(ch4300 ) has increased by about 18% between 1993 and 1998 as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( this interval corresponds to about 100 au ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that , from the analysis of the damped ly@xmath5 profile ( blended with h@xmath0 lines ) , we get an estimate of the hi column density , n(hi ) = 2.51 10@xmath11 @xmath12 , which is 38% higher than the value derived from 1979 iue data , n(hi ) = 1.82 10@xmath11 @xmath12 ( @xcite ; the time interval corresponds to about 300 au ) .    regarding ch@xmath1 , we get a less stringent limit on small scale variations @xmath6n / n @xmath10 15% and do not find evidence for a similar large scale variation .",
    "let us conclude with a few prospects .",
    "the coming cycle 2 and 3 fuse spectra will clearly allow us to improve the sampling and to extend the range of scales probed .",
    "thus , we will be more sensitive to a small regular variation ( i.e. of n(h@xmath0 , j=0 or 1 ) ) .",
    "additional spectra will also help to establish the reality of variations suspected for the weak lines of highly excited h@xmath0 , and quantify the magnitude of these changes .",
    "finally , we note that hst / stis spectra would complement these fuse data in a very useful way because a ) the hst range comprises a lot of vibrationally excited h@xmath0 transitions ; b ) given the spectral resolution of stis , most of these lines would appear unblended ; c ) changes in the kinematics of the excited h@xmath0 would be much more apparent .",
