    "the problem of constructing a map of the cmb anisotropies from a set of time - ordered data ( tod ) has been studied by many authors .",
    "the methods can be broadly divided into two classes : ` optimal ' methods that provide a least squares map making solution ( _ e.g. _ wright 1996 ; wright 1996 ; tegmark 1997a , b ; borrill 2001 ; natoli 2001 ; dor 2001 ) and approximate ` destriping ' methods ( _ e.g. _ burigana 1997 ; delabrouille 1998 ; maino 1999 ; revenu 2000 ; keihnen 2003 ) .",
    "a brute force application of ` optimal ' methods requires the inversion of large matrices and is computationally impractical for large tods such as those expected from wmap and _ planck_. as a result , iterative algorithms have been developed ( _ e.g. _ wright 1996 ; natoli 2001 ; dor 2001 ) which do not require matrix inversions . nevertheless , for _",
    "planck_-sized datasets , these iterative algorithms are computationally expensive and require the use of supercomputers .",
    "destriping algorithms are well suited to a _ planck_-type scanning strategy in which the sky is scanned many times on rings .",
    "the tod can then be averaged on rings and the effects of low frequency noise noise approximated by a constant offset for each ring .",
    "the offsets can be determined from the ring overlaps .",
    "destriping algorithms are conceptually simple and computationally fast . even for _",
    "planck_-sized tods it is practical to apply destriping map making methods on many thousands of simulations to test the effects of various systematic errors ( see _ e.g. _ poutanen 2004 ) .",
    "the motivation for this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , although a number of authors have investigated destriping algorithms , almost all of this work has been numerical .",
    "a notable exception is the paper by stompor and white ( 2004 ) who present an analysis of destriping errors for some simple scanning strategies .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to develop on the work of stompor and white and to derive an analytic model of the effects of destriping errors on the cmb power spectrum for _ planck_-like scanning strategies .",
    "this is useful because it helps in developing an understanding of the map - making process and how the errors depend on the parameters of the experiment .",
    "this analysis also sheds light on the differences between destriping and ` optimal ' map - making methods .",
    "in particular , whether the extra computational cost and complexity of an optimal method actually produces any significant improvement on simple destriping .",
    "the second motivation for this paper follows from the need to compute estimates of the cmb power spectrum , @xmath2 , rapidly and acurately . in an earlier paper ( efstathiou 2004 , hereafter e04 ) a fast hybrid estimator",
    "was developed that combines a quadratic maximum likelihood estimator at low multipoles with a set of ` pseudo-@xmath2 ' estimates at high multipoles with different pixel weightings . in e04",
    "this method was tested against numerical simulations that used a realistic scanning strategy for _ planck _ , but assumed uncorrelated white noise . in this approximation ,",
    "the hybrid estimator was shown to be very close to optimal and , importantly , can provide an accurate estimate of the covariance matrix @xmath3 . however , in a realistic experiment , striping errors will introduce correlations in the noise .",
    "the question then arises as to whether the hybrid estimator is applicable , for example , is there a natural angular scale below which the noise can be assumed white , and if so , what fixes this scale ?    our goal , therefore , is to investigate the effects of destriping errors on the cmb power spectrum for realistic scanning strategies and noise models .",
    "it should be emphasised that we do not attempt to develop a new map making technique , nor to investigate ` real world ' complexities such as asymmetric beams , positional errors or non - stationary noise , though we will comment on how some of these aspects may effect our results .",
    "we denote the noise contribution to the tod by @xmath4 , which is considered to be a vector specified at integer values of the sampling frequency @xmath5 , _ i.e. _ @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the discrete fourier transform of the noise tod is denoted @xmath8 and the power spectrum @xmath9 is assumed to be of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the  knee frequencyand @xmath12 is the total length of the time - stream .",
    "the variance of the noise contribution given the power spectrum ( [ ds1 ] ) is @xmath13 and thus @xmath14 fixes the overall amplitude of the noise and is equal to the variance of white noise in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "the actual tod is the sum of the true sky signal @xmath16 and the noise tod @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a pointing matrix mapping a pixel @xmath19 on the sky to the pixel @xmath20 in the tod . for a _",
    "planck_-type scanning strategy , the same circle on the sky is mapped @xmath21 times before the satellite is repointed .",
    "we will denote the spin period by @xmath22 and the repointing time interval by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . as explained in the introduction ,",
    "the main aim of this paper is not to develop an ` optimal ' map - making technique , but rather to gain an intuitive understanding of the error properties of simple destriping map making methods .",
    "we therefore assume perfect pointing and simply average the tod on each scanning ring : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of pixels withing a single ring pixel and @xmath27 is the mean vaue of the tod in ring pixel @xmath20 of ring @xmath28 .",
    "this simple averaging is the maximum likelihood solution for map making on a ring if the pointing is assumed to be perfect .",
    "it is possible to improve on ( [ ds4 ] ) to account for imperfect pointing by solving the maximum likelihood equations to reconstruct a map from all scanning rings within a single pointing period ( see , for example , van leeuwen 2002 ) .",

    "table 1 also serves as a summary of the notation used in this paper . the knee frequency in table 1",
    "has been chosen to be representative of the @xmath56 ghz channel of the _ planck _ low frequency instrument ( lfi ) ( see tuovinen 2003 ) .",
    "this is an interesting case because the knee frequency is about twice the spin frequency .",
    "the knee frequencies for the _ planck _ high frequency instrument ( hfi ) should be smaller than the spin frequency .",
    "this case is less interesting because if @xmath57 , it is a very good approximation to model the low frequency noise as a constant offset in each ring .",
    "the noise level @xmath58 for the simulations has been chosen so that the cmb power spectrum is noise dominated at multipoles @xmath59 ( rather than to match the noise for any of the planck detectors ) .",
    "the input cmb power spectrum , @xmath2 , is that of the concordance @xmath60cdm model favoured by wmap ( spergel 2003 ) . as in e04 , unless stated otherwise beam functions will not be written explicitly in equations , thus @xmath2 will ususally mean @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the spherical transform of a symmetric gaussian beam .",
    "the remaining parameters , such as the number of rings , number of ring pixels , map pixel size _ etc _ were chosen so that large numbers of simulations could be run quickly .",
    "the basic assumption behind destriping techniques is that low frequency drifts in the tod can be accounted for by adding a constant offset @xmath54 to each ring .",
    "the ring offsets can be determined by minimising @xmath63 where the notation @xmath64 indicates that the ring pixels @xmath65 and @xmath20 overlap the same map pixel @xmath55 .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ ds5 ] ) is included to enforce the condition @xmath66 .",
    "the offsets are therefore given by the solution of the linear equations @xmath67 there has been some discussion in the literature concerning the weighting of the term in the first summation in equation ( [ ds5 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ ds5 ] ) assigns equal weight to each overlapping pixel , as in maino ( 1999 ) .",
    "delabrouille ( 1998 ) assigns a weight @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the total hit count in map pixel @xmath19 , while keihnen ( 2003 ) assign a weight @xmath70 . for _ planck_-like scanning strategies the differences between destriping using these weight functions are much smaller than the striping errors themselves ( see figure 3 of keihnen 2003 ) and so the weight function will be set to unity throughout this paper .",
    "equations ( [ ds6 ] ) can be solved by a matrix inversion and the solution is independent of the regularising parameter @xmath71 , provided it is chosen to be large enough .",
    "alternatively , these equations can be solved by iteration by setting @xmath72 adding the derived offsets to @xmath27 and re - evaluating equation ( [ ds7 ] ) until the offsets ( [ ds7 ] ) converge to zero . in ( [ ds7 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath73 is the number of pixels on all rings that overlap pixels on ring @xmath28 .",
    "this algorithm is identical to the plate matching procedures applied to create galaxy catalogues from photographic data ( groth and peebles 1986 ; maddox , efstathiou and sutherland 1996 ) .",
    "if the number of overlaps per ring is large , then an accurate estimate of the variance of the offsets can be derived from the first iteration of equation ( [ ds7 ] ) , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of identical ring pixels summed over all pairs of rings @xmath76 , @xmath77 that overlap with ring @xmath28 . in equation ( [ ds7 ] ) we have assumed that the noise in each averaged ring pixel is white , with variance @xmath78 , which is accurate on a single ring even in the presence of @xmath1 noise unless @xmath79 .",

    ", we can model the striping errors as a set of random offsets with dispersion @xmath90 and effective ring - width @xmath91 as illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "as shown in the next section , the contributions of these errors to the spherical harmonics and power spectrum of the destriped maps can , in this approximation , be calculated exactly for the case of a perfect ring torus .",
    "\\(d ) there is almost no perceptible difference in the correlation functions for the two scanning strategies",
    ". we would therefore expect ( and this is verified in section 4 ) that the effects of destriping errors on the power spectra should be very similar for these two scanning strategies .",
    "\\(e ) the striping errors arising from the dispersion in the ring offsets are ` irreducible ' errors . by this , we mean that these errors are fixed by the instrumental white noise on the rings and the crossing points ( interconnectedness ) of the tod .",
    "they can not be reduced by applying more time - consuming ` optimal ' map - making methods ( see section 5 ) . however , since the knee frequency @xmath11 exceeds both the repointing frequency @xmath92 and the spin frequency , the averaged ring data @xmath27 will contain low amplitude gradients associated with ` @xmath1 ' noise .",
    "these gradients can , in principle , be removed by modifying the destriping code to determine from the crossing points a few low order coefficients in , say , a legendre poynomial or fourier expansion , ( delabrouille 1998 ; keihnen 2003 ) however , as we will show in section 3 , the effects of these gradients are smaller than the effects of the offset errors .    3.8 truein",
    "in this section we consider a scanning strategy which leads to a perfect ring torus , _",
    "i.e. _ the spin axis is aligned with the ecliptic plane as the sky is scanned by a single detector with a bore - sight angle of @xmath83 .",
    "for such a scanning strategy , the distribution of hit - counts on the sky will follow a distribution with ecliptic latitude of @xmath93 the hit - count distribution is therefore highest at @xmath94 and lowest at the ecliptic @xmath95 .",
    "as described in the previous section , the offsets @xmath54 of each ring can be modelled as a set of independent gaussian random variates with dispersion @xmath90 .",
    "the map constructed from these ring offsets ( which we will refer to as the error map ) will contain most of the information on pixel correlations introduced by the map - making process .",
    "our goal in this section is to compute the effects of these errors on the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the spherical harmonic transform of the error map can be written as @xmath96 where the index @xmath28 denotes the ring number , @xmath20 denotes the pixel number within the ring and @xmath97 is the solid angle of the ring pixel .",
    "the weight factors @xmath98 account for the averaging of the ring pixels in constructing the map and thus are proportional to the inverse of the hit count distribution of equation ( [ rt1 ] ) .    to evaluate equation ( [ rt2 ] ) , reorient each ring to a new coordinate system @xmath99 in which the spin axis is aligned with the new @xmath100 axis .",
    "the spherical harmonic transform for each ring is then , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the constant ring - offset @xmath103 and the @xmath104 are the normalising factors of the spherical harmonics @xmath105 notice that the hit count distribution has been normalised so that the sum of the weight factors @xmath106 for a complete ring torus ( which completely covers the sky twice for the case @xmath107 ) . performing the integral over @xmath108 in equation ( [ rt3a ] ) , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is zero for all odd values of @xmath111 . transforming back into the original coordinate system @xmath112",

    "since @xmath129 is zero for odd values of @xmath111 , it follows that @xmath130 for odd values of @xmath131 .",
    "an alternative derivation of the @xmath132 for the special case @xmath107 , ( in which the spherical harmonic transform for each ring is evaluated in a coordinate system with the @xmath133-axis perpendicular to the spin axis ) gives @xmath134 where @xmath135 for large values of @xmath131 the integral in equation ( [ rt10b ] ) can be approximated by @xmath136 hence @xmath137 equation ( [ rt12 ] ) is , in fact , an extremely good approximation ( to within 2% ) to the exact answers of equations ( [ rt9 ] ) and ( [ rt10a ] ) for values of @xmath131 as small as @xmath138 .",
    "some examples of the error power spectra for three values of @xmath83 are shown in figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "for each value of @xmath83 , @xmath139 simulations were generated each with @xmath140 rings assigned random offsets .",
    "the rings were then mapped on to the igloo pixelization scheme described in e04 with @xmath141 pixels simply by assigning the nearest map pixel to each ring pixel and averaging over all of the ring pixels assigned to any particular map pixel .",
    "the power spectra were computed from the igloo maps using using fast spherical transforms . as can be seen from figure [ figure2 ]",
    ", the finite sizes of the ring and map pixels introduce some structure in the final error maps .",
    "nevertheless , the mean power spectra for the error maps ( shown by the points in figure [ figure3 ] ) agree perfectly with the analytic results of equation ( [ rt9 ] ) which were derived in the continuum limit .",
    "evidently , the effects of finite pixelisation and ring widths are negligible and hence the analytic model developed in this section gives an extremely accurate representation of the destriping errors .",
    "if the primordial fluctuations are gaussian , the spherical harmonic coefficients will satisfy @xmath142 the striping erros will , however , introduce correlations in the @xmath143 . from equation ( [ rt6 ] ) it is straightforward to show that the correlations introduced by striping are given by @xmath144 for the special case @xmath107 , these correlations can be written as @xmath145 where @xmath146 if the vector @xmath147 is ordered as @xmath148 , ( _ i.e. _ @xmath149 , @xmath150 , _ etc _ ) the covariance matrix @xmath151 will have a block diagonal structure .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] shows examples of these covariance matrices for the three scanning strategies discussed above . as we will show in the next section",
    ", these off - diagonal correlations will be much smaller than the diagonal components for the parameters of a realistic experiment .",
    "however , since the departures from gaussianity in most inflationary models are expected to be small ( for a comprehensive review see bartolo 2004 ) , residual map - making errors could prove problematic in testing for non - gaussianity . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on errors on estimates of the cmb power spectrum , though it is important to recognise that even if map - making errors can be shown to have a negligible effect on the power spectrum , they may be important for other statistical tests .",
    "in this section , we describe the results from a set of simulations with realistic ` @xmath1 ' noise ( equation [ ds1 ] ) with the parameters given in table 1 . as explained in section 2 , the resolution and sizes of the maps and ring sets",
    "were chosen so that large numbers of simulations could be run quickly while demonstrating the salient features of the map - making problem . as a further speed up ,",
    "@xmath1-noise was generated by using an fft for frequencies below @xmath152 . above this frequency",
    "the noise was assumed to be white , which has the additional advantage that the white noise can be added to ring pixels ` on the fly ' so that it is never necessary to store a complete tod in memory . a complete simulation , including noise generation , destriping and power spectrum estimation takes approximately @xmath56 seconds on an single @xmath153ghz itanium 2 processor .",
    "splitting the noise into a low frequency ` @xmath1 ' component and a high frequency white noise component has the additional advantage that the effects of low and high frequency noise on destriping can be investigated separately .",
    "we have run two sets each of @xmath86 simulations for the two scanning strategies adopted for figure 1 , namely , @xmath154 with no precession and @xmath154 with a slow sinusoidal precession of @xmath155 . in each case",
    ", we generated three ring - sets for each simulation : one with white noise only , one with low frequency ` @xmath1 ' noise only , and one using the sum of these two noise models .",
    "these ring - sets were passed through the destriping algorithm to produce three maps per simulation .",
    "the averaged power spectra for the two sets of simulations are plotted in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "7.5 truein    the upper panels in figure [ figure5 ] show the power spectra for the case of white noise only on the rings .",
    "this is the case that is closest to the analytic model of the previous section .",
    "as expected , the analytic model of equation ( [ rt9 ] ) summed with the appropriate constant white noise level , provides an excellent match to the simulations when proper allowance is made to calculate the effective ring width using the correlation functions of figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "this is true even for the slow precession scanning strategy shown in figure [ figure5]d .",
    "the main effect of a the slow precession is to fill in the coverage gaps at the eclipic poles , but the ring pattern is so close to a perfect ring torus that the residual striping errors produce a nearly identical effect on the power spectrum .",
    "figures [ figure5]b and [ figure5]e show the residual striping errors when only low frequency ` @xmath1 ' noise is included .",
    "these errors arise primarily from residual gradients on the rings and so their amplitude depends on the knee frequency .",
    "had we adopted a knee frequency much smaller than the spin frequency , these errors would have had a much lower amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , even for the parameters adopted here , the amplitude of these errors is considerable smaller than the errors caused by the dispersions in the ring offsets .",
    "notice that these errors also decay roughly as @xmath156 , as for the error power spectra for pure white noise .",
    "as mentioned earlier , delabrouille ( 1998 ) and keihnen ( 2003 ) have explored fitting low order functions for each ring during destriping , rather than a single offset @xmath54 .",
    "the results are mixed and in fact keihnen ( 2003 ) find that including more parameters actually produces larger power spectrum errors than simply fitting constant offsets .",
    "this is not suprising because the errors on the individual crossing points are dominated by the white noise .",
    "if the white noise level is high , and the knee frequency is low , there may not be enough crossing points to determine more than a single constant offset per ring with any precision .",
    "the points in the lower panels in figure [ figure5 ] show the errors for the full noise model .",
    "these are just the sum of the white noise and ` @xmath1 ' errors .",
    "the theoretical models , plotted as the solid lines , are simply equation ( [ rt9 ] ) rescaled to provide a good match to the simulations , summed with the appropriate constant white noise level .",
    "these provide an excellent match to the simulation results .",
    "the general shape of the power spectrum errors @xmath157 plotted in figures [ figure5]c and [ figure5]f is well known from previous numerical work on destriping ( delabrouille 1998 ; maino 1999 ; 2000 ; keihnen 2003 ) .",
    "however , the results presented here explain why the errors have this particular form and how they depend on the parameters of the experiment .",
    "finally , in figure [ figure6 ] we illustrate the effects of ` @xmath1 ' noise on a simulated map of the cmb sky for the scanning strategy with a slow sinusoidal precession .",
    "figure [ figure6]a shows the power spectra of the input map , the destriped map and for the difference map .",
    "the power spectrum of the difference map is shown on a greatly expanded scale in figure [ figure6]b , together with the analytic model plotted in figure [ figure5]f .",
    "figure [ figure6]c shows the differences between the power spectra of the input and output maps but with the white noise level subtracted , again plotted on an expanded scale .",
    "the solid lines show the expected errors @xmath158 using the error model of figure [ figure5]f .",
    "the dotted lines in this figure show the expected error from white noise alone .",
    "notice that pure white noise is an excellent approximation to the errors for @xmath159 and that even at low multipoles the destriping errors are much smaller than the cosmic variance @xmath160 .",
    "for example , the error in the quadrupole amplitude for this realisation is @xmath161 , compared to the expected cosmic variance of @xmath162 .",
    "compared to the cosmic variance , the destriping errors at low multipoles can be ignored .",
    "furthermore , errors of this magnitude are much smaller than the errors of @xmath163-@xmath164 expected from inaccurate subtraction of the galaxy ( _ cf _ the discussion of the effects of galactic subtraction on the low multipoles measured by wmap , bennet 2003 ; slosar and seljak 2004 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an analytic analysis of the effects of destriping errors on the cmb power spectrum for various scanning strategies .",
    "destriping errors produce a characteristic error power spectrum of the form shown in figure [ figure3 ] which decays roughly as @xmath156 .",
    "the amplitude of the error power spectrum is determined by the number of intersections in the ring set which depends on the scanning strategy . in agreement with stompor and white ( 2003 ) , and with earlier numerical work , there are so many interconnections in a _",
    "planck_-like scanning strategy that the destriping errors should be small .",
    "maps from _ planck _ will therefore be dominated by white noise , underneath which there will be low amplitude correlated noise associated with striping .",
    "nevertheless , the low amplitude errors from striping introduce a characteristic block - diagonal structure in the covariance matrix for the @xmath143 .",
    "these could confuse searches for small amplitude physical effects , such as non - gaussian features of the cmb signal .    the implications of our analysis for the application of a hybrid power spectrum estimator to _",
    "planck_-like data are fairly self - evident . since the noise can be very accurately approximated as white for multipoles @xmath165 , the combination of a number of pseudo-@xmath2 estimators with different pixel weighting schemes as in e04 should give a close to optimal estimate of the power spectrum at high multipoles . at low multipoles ,",
    "an estimate of @xmath2 can be found by applying a quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimator ( tegmark 1997c ) to a low resolution map .",
    "this providesa close to optimal estimate of the power spectrum at low multipoles , taking into account of masked regions of the sky , and returns an estimate of the covariance matrix @xmath166 that . for the qml estimates",
    ", it should be an excellent approximation simply to neglect destriping errors , since these are likely to be negligible compared to the cosmic variance . if necessary , destriping errors can be taken into account in the qml estimates , and folded into the covariance matrix , by computing the full pixel - noise covariance matrix on a low resolution map using an optimal map making algorithm .    finally , this analysis has some implications for optimal map making algorithms .",
    "the maximum likelihood map @xmath167 is given by the well - known expression @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the noise covariance matrix @xmath170 . since @xmath169 is symmetric , it can be written as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is orthogonal and @xmath173 is diagonal .",
    "the matrix @xmath174 is a ` prewhitening filter ' , since the noise matrix of the vector @xmath175 is diagonal . in terms of the prewhitened time - stream ,",
    "equation ( [ c1 ] ) can be written as , @xmath176 now consider equation ( [ c3 ] ) applied to a tod consisting of repeated scans of a single ring with stationary noise of an arbitrary power spectral shape .",
    "if edge effects are ignored then the components of @xmath173 will be identical , in which case the solution of ( [ c3 ] ) is obviously the average of @xmath177 over the rings ( equation [ ds4 ] ) .",
    "the _ rhs _ of equation ( [ c3 ] ) effectively filters the tod , but this is undone by the _ lhs _ to return the average of the signal over the rings .",
    "now consider a tod consisting of a set of rings as in the _ planck_-like scanning strategies considered in this paper .",
    "the maximum likelihood map will differ from a simple average over rings because the rings cross .",
    "thus optimal map making performs destriping by comparing the crossing points of the tod .",
    "however , since the noise on a single ring is dominated by white noise , optimal map making can not reduce the errors much below the ` irreducible ' white noise errors shown in figures [ figure5]a and [ figure5]d .",
    "optimal map making can , in principle , reduce the map making errors associated with ` @xmath1 ' noise ( _ cf _ figures [ figure5]b and [ figure5]e ) if the knee frequency is significantly greater than the spin frequency , but even in this case , the ability to reduce these errors will be limited by the white noise on a ring .",
    "these arguments suggest that for a _ planck_-like scanning strategy , simple destriping algorithms will be very close to optimal , and may actually be preferable to optimal algorithms because of their speed and because they require fewer assumptions about the noise .",
    "optimal algorithms are only optimal if the noise model is accurate . in practice , with realistic non - stationary noise , simple destriping may perform just as well and conceivably better than an optimal algorithm .",
