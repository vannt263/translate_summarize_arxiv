    "the disorder - induced localization - delocalization transition in the quantum hall effect is the oldest and best - known example of a topological phase transition.@xcite the transition is called topological because it is associated with a change in a topological invariant , the chern number , which counts the number of edge states and the quantized value of the hall conductance.@xcite since there is still no analytical theory for the quantum hall phase transition , computer simulations are needed to calculate the scaling law and critical exponent associated with the diverging localization length at the transition .",

    "<S> we construct a periodically time - dependent hamiltonian with a phase transition in the quantum hall universality class . one spatial dimension can be eliminated by introducing a second incommensurate driving frequency , so that we can study the quantum hall effect in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system . </S>",
