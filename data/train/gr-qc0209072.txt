    "this is the second in a series of papers aimed to establish a practical calculation scheme for the self force acting on a point particle in orbit around a black hole .",
    "this scheme  referred to as the `` mode - sum method''stems from the general regularization prescription by mino , sasaki , and tanaka ( mst)@xcite and quinn and wald ( qw)@xcite . in effect , the mode - sum method re - formulates the mst - qw general result in the language of multipole modes , thereby making it accessible to standard numerical treatment . in practice ,",
    "the application of this method involves two basic parts : ( i ) calculation of the `` full '' modes of the force , through numerical integration of the decoupled field equations ; and ( ii ) analytical derivation of certain parameters ( whose values depend on the orbit under consideration ) called the `` regularization parameters '' ( rp ) .",
    "previously , the explicit values of the rp were derived analytically in a few special cases of orbits in schwarzschild spacetime  specifically , for circular and radial orbits in the scalar field case @xcite , and for radial trajectories in the gravitational case @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the rp values where calculated through a rather cumbersome local expansion of the ( @xmath0-multipole ) green s function .",
    "the application of this technique to more general orbits appears a challenging task .    in a recent letter @xcite",
    ", the joint groups of barack and ori ( bo ) and mino , nakano , and sasaki ( mns ) devised an alternative , more direct method for obtaining the rp .",
    "the new method is based on a multipole decomposition of the explicit `` direct '' part of the force ( see below ) . using this method , bo and mns",
    "were able to calculate the explicit rp values for both the scalar and gravitational self forces , for any geodesic orbit in schwarzschild spacetime . in a preceding paper @xcite ( hereafter referred to as `` paper i '' ) bo described the full details of the new calculation technique , as applied to the toy - model of the _ scalar _ self force acting on a scalar charge .",
    "the current paper deals with the more interesting case of the _ gravitational _ self force on a mass particle , and provides full details of the rp derivation in this case .",
    "in addition , we shall derive here the rp values for the _ electromagnetic _ self force acting on an electrically charged particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "( bo and mns applied two slightly different methods in obtaining the rp ; mns describe their calculation in @xcite . )",
    "the analysis presented in this paper relies greatly on the technique and results of paper i , to which we shall frequently refer the reader .",
    "though the basic idea of our calculation is the same as in the scalar toy model of paper i , some unavoidable technical complexities arise when coming to consider the gravitational or electromagnetic cases . in particular , one then has to consider an extension of the particle s four - velocity ( which takes part in constructing the `` direct force''see below ) off the worldline , and address the question of the rp dependence on the ( non - unique ) choice of such extension .",
    "another , more fundamental issue , is the gauge dependence of the gravitational self force and its implication to the mode sum scheme ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "most of our manuscript will concern with the ( most interesting ) gravitational case .",
    "our analytical technique is easily applicable to the ( simpler ) electromagnetic case , which we shall later consider in a separate section .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the rest of this introductory section we set up the physical scenario of a pointlike mass particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole , introduce mst - qw s prescription for calculating the gravitational self force on this particle , and review the basics of the mode - sum method . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we present mst s expression for the direct part of the gravitational self force , and analytically process this expression to extract the information relevant for deriving the rp . section [ seciii ] contains the heart of our calculation , namely , the derivation of all rp for any geodesic orbit , in the gravitational case .",
    "section [ secv ] deals with the electromagnetic case . in sec .",
    "[ secvi ] we summarize the prescription for calculating the gravitational and electromagnetic self forces via the mode - sum method , and give some concluding remarks .",
    "throughout this paper we use geometrized units ( with @xmath1 ) , metric signature @xmath2 , and the standard schwarzschild coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "we consider a pointlike particle of mass @xmath4 , moving freely in the vacuum exterior of a schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath5 .",
    "( qw @xcite discuss the extent to which the concept of a pointlike particle makes sense in the context of the radiation reaction problem . ) in the limit @xmath6 , the particle traces a geodesic @xmath7 of the schwarzschild background . due to angular momentum conservation , the geodesic orbit ( as well as the orbit under self - force effect ) is confined to a plain , which , without loss of generality , we shall take as the equatorial plain , @xmath8 .",
    "when the mass @xmath4 is finite , the particle no longer moves on a geodesic . in this case",
    ", it is useful to view the particle as being subject to a self force induced by its own gravitational field ( treated as a perturbation over the background geometry ) .",
    "the particle s equation of motion thus takes the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 , a semicolon denotes covariant differentiation with respect to the background geometry , and @xmath11 describes the leading - order self - force effect . in the following",
    "we shall consider the self force acting on the particle at an arbitrary point along its worldline , denoted by @xmath12 ( in our setup @xmath13 ) .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath14 to represent a point in the neighborhood of @xmath15 .",
    "we will denote the metric of the perturbed spacetime as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ( schwarzschild ) background metric and @xmath18 is the metric perturbation induced by the particle . following mst - qw , we consider the metric perturbation @xmath19 specifically in the harmonic gauge .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath20 the trace - reversed perturbation : @xmath21      mst and qw found that the gravitational self force on a particle freely moving in a vacuum spacetime can be formally constructed as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the `` tail '' force , associated with the mere effect of waves scattered _ inside _ ( rather than propagating along ) the particle s past light cone .",
    "the tail force can be derived from the `` tail '' part of the metric perturbation , as defined by mst @xcite , through @xmath24 here , the tensor @xmath25 is any ( sufficiently regular ) extension of the tensor @xmath26 defined at @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 refer to the values of the four - velocity and the metric tensor at @xmath15 .",
    "[ later we shall employ a specific extension of @xmath30 ; note that the choice of extension does not affect the physical self force @xmath31 , though , obviously , it does affect the field @xmath32 off the worldline . ]",
    "the ( singular ) difference between the `` full '' perturbation @xmath33 and the tail part @xmath34 is associated with the instantaneous effect of waves propagating directly along the particle s light cone .",
    "this part is referred to as the `` direct '' perturbation : @xmath35 correspondingly , we define the `` direct '' force as @xmath36 defining also the `` full '' force , @xmath37 we then have @xmath38 the explicit form of the direct perturbation has been derived by mst @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is given below in eq.([ii-10 ] ) , and serves as the starting point for our analysis .",
    "note that both the direct force and the full force , which were defined above as vector fields in the neighborhood of @xmath15 , diverge as @xmath39 .",
    "however , their difference , yielding the tail force , admits a perfectly regular limit @xmath39 , which , according to mst - qw , represents the physical self force . in this",
    "respect , notice also the freedom one has in choosing the extension @xmath25 , as long as this extension is regular enough and reduces to @xmath40 in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "one has to make sure , though , that _ the same extension @xmath25 _ is applied to both the direct and the full forces .",
    "the mode - sum method was previously introduced @xcite as a practical method for calculating the mst - qw self force given in eq .",
    "( [ i-30 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the method is reviewed in paper i ; here we merely describe the basic prescription ( as applied to the gravitational case ) and introduce the relevant notation .    in the mode - sum scheme ,",
    "one first formally expands the gravitational tail force , as well as the full and direct forces , into multipole @xmath0-modes , in the form @xmath41 here , precisely as in the scalar case , the modes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are obtained by decomposing ( each of the vectorial components of ) the corresponding quantities @xmath23 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 into standard scalar spherical harmonics , and then , for any given multipole number @xmath0 , summing over all azimuthal numbers @xmath47 .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that the various @xmath0-modes introduced in eq .",

    "harmonic modes in actual calculations .",
    "the construction of the full - force scalar - harmonic modes @xmath43 from the full perturbation tensor - harmonic modes can be prescribed in a straightforward manner ( as , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",

    "the rp @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 may be defined by the demand that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ i-90 ] ) would converge .",
    "equivalently ( and more practically ) , one may define these parameters by requiring convergence of the sum @xmath54\\equiv d^{\\alpha}.\\ ] ] this sum then defines the fourth parameter , @xmath53 . from the above definitions it is clear that the rp values may be derived through analysis of the direct force modes @xmath55 .",
    "( [ i-90 ] ) constitutes a practical prescription for constructing the gravitational self force , given ( i ) the values of all necessary rp , and ( ii ) the full - force modes @xmath43 . in this paper",
    "we derive all rp for any ( equatorial ) geodesic orbit in schwarzschild spacetime , hence setting an analytical basis for calculations of the gravitational self force for all such orbits .",

    "( [ i-75 ] ) . in this equation , recall , @xmath25 is an extension off the point @xmath15 of the tensor @xmath40 defined at @xmath15 in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath73 [ see eq .",
    "( [ i-50 ] ) ] . in our analysis",
    "we decompose the components of the field @xmath74 in spherical harmonics .",
    "since this decomposition is nonlocal ( it involves an integration over the 2-sphere @xmath75 ) , it will generally depend on the extension of @xmath40 , which we now have to specify .",

    "note that the quantity @xmath97 , which is regular at @xmath27 , generally contains also terms of order @xmath98 and higher .",

    "are all analogous to ones that occur in the scalar model [ see eq .",
    "( 23 ) of paper i ] , whereas the @xmath144 contribution has no counterpart in the scalar case considered therein .",
    "we also point out that , since @xmath108 does not depend on the extension of @xmath145 ( unlike @xmath107 ) , one finds that the leading - order term of @xmath99 is extension - independent , whereas the explicit form of the higher - oder terms does depend , in general , on the choice of extension .",
    "in principle , the derivation of the rp will now involve expanding the direct force components @xmath99 in scalar spherical harmonics , and then taking the limit @xmath39 [ just as in the scalar case analysiscf.eq .",
    "( 27 ) in paper i ] .",
    "this will yield the @xmath0-mode contribution to the direct force , @xmath44 , from which one may deduce the values of all rp .",

    "( [ ii-160 ] ) , and the corresponding expression obtained in the scalar toy model [ see eq .  ( 22 ) of paper i ] : these expressions differ only in the explicit form of the three coefficients @xmath146 .",
    "conveniently , this analogy will now allow us to base most of our analysis on results already obtained in paper i.    we begin by recalling the expression obtained for the direct force in the scalar case [ see eq .",

    "we use the label `` sca '' to distinguish quantities associated with the scalar case , from their gravitational - case counterparts .    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ ii-160 ] ) and ( [ iii-1 ] ) , taking into account also the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath154 and @xmath155 , we now express the gravitational direct force as a sum of three terms , in the form @xmath156 where @xmath157 we proceed by considering separately the contributions to the rp from each of the three terms @xmath158 .",
    "consider first the term @xmath160 of the gravitational direct force .",

    "( [ ii-120 ] ) ] . since the constant array @xmath108 does not interfere with the multipole decomposition",
