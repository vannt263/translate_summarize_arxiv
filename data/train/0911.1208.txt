    "let us consider the gowdy solution  @xcite , which describes a space - time containing plane polarized gravitational waves .",
    "the line element can be written as @xmath0 where the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 only , and periodic in @xmath4 . the initial slice @xmath5 is usually chosen so that the simulations can start with an homogeneous lapse .",
    "let us now perform the following time coordinate transformation @xmath6 so that the expanding line element ( [ gowdy_line ] ) is seen in the new time coordinate @xmath7 as collapsing towards the @xmath8 singularity , which is approached only in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "this  singularity avoidance \" property of the @xmath7 coordinate is due to the fact that the resulting slicing by @xmath10 surfaces is harmonic @xcite .",
    "we will run our simulations in normal coordinates , starting with a constant lapse @xmath11 at @xmath12 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "standard cross - comparison tests  @xcite are currently done with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "but one gets basically the same results by setting up algebraic boundary conditions , which take advantage of the symmetries of the gowdy line element . for a rectangular grid ,",
    "planar symmetry allows trivial boundary conditions along the @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions .",
    "also , allowing for the fact that the @xmath4 dependence in ( [ gowdy_line ] ) is only through @xmath15 , one can set reflecting boundary conditions for the interval @xmath16 . in this way",
    ", the gowdy waves metric is obtained as a sort of stationary gravitational wave in a cavity with perfectly reflecting walls .",
    "we can then set up a full set of algebraic boundary conditions , which are consistent with the gowdy line element ( [ gowdy_line ] ) for all times .",
    "this opens the door to a selective testing procedure , where one could for instance try some constraint - preserving condition for the longitudinal and transverse - trace modes , while keeping the exact condition for the transverse traceless ones . or , as we will do below , testing just some energy - constraint preserving boundary conditions while dealing with all the remaining modes in an exact way .",
    "we will consider here the the first - order version in normal coordinates , as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . for further convenience",
    ", we will recombine the basic first - order fields @xmath17 in the following way : @xmath18 so that the new basis is @xmath19 .",
    "note that the vector @xmath20 can be recovered easily from this new basis as @xmath21    in order to compute the characteristic matrix , we will consider the standard form of ( the principal part of ) the evolution system as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for the array of dynamical fields and @xmath24 is the array of fluxes along the direction given by the unit vector @xmath25 . with this choice of basic dynamical fields ,",
    "the principal part of the evolution system gets a very simple form in the harmonic slicing case : @xmath26 where the index @xmath27 means a projection along @xmath28 , and we have noted for short @xmath29 where round brackets denote index symmetrization .",
    "we can now identify the constraint modes , by looking at the fluxes of @xmath30 and @xmath20 in the array ( [ evol a]-[evol e ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ evol a ] ) that the energy - constraint modes are given by the pair @xmath31 with propagation speed @xmath32 . also , allowing for ( [ zfrom mu],[evol e ] ) , we can easily recover the flux of @xmath33 : @xmath34 so that we can identify the momentum - constraint modes with the three pairs @xmath35 with propagation speed @xmath32 . note that , allowing for ( [ pimu a ] ) , the longitudinal component @xmath36 does correspond with the transverse - trace component of the extrinsic curvature @xmath37 .",
    "we give now the remaining modes : the fully transverse ones , with propagation speed @xmath32 , @xmath38 ( the capital indices denote a projection orthogonal to @xmath28 ) , and the standing modes ( zero propagation speed ) : @xmath39 note that the standing modes ( [ standing ] ) , the energy modes ( [ energy pair ] ) and the transverse momentum modes @xmath40 actually vanish for the gowdy line element ( [ gowdy_line ] ) .",
    "in refs .",
    "@xcite , the system above was shown to be symmetric hyperbolic , by providing a suitable energy estimate .",
    "we can rewrite it here as @xmath41 this leads to the following sufficient condition for stability @xmath42 where @xmath43 stands for the boundary surface ( @xmath25 being here the outward normal ) .",
    "let us consider for instance the boundary at @xmath44 .",
    "we can enforce there the partial set of exact ( reflection ) boundary conditions @xmath45 , so that the requirement ( [ bterm ] ) reduces to @xmath46 which can be used for a separate test of energy - constraint preserving boundary conditions .    as an illustration , we will test two such conditions . the first one is given in the form of a logical gate : @xmath47 ( @xmath30-gate ) , so that it only acts when condition ( [ beterm ] ) is violated .",
    "the second one is an advection equation @xmath48 where we have included a suitable damping term .",
    "note that the principal part of the constraint - preserving condition ( [ advect ] ) coincides with the maximal dissipation one , @xmath49 , which is not constraint - preserving in the generic case . condition ( [ advect ] ) can be understood as a sort of maximal dissipation condition for the energy - constraint evolution equation @xmath50 which follows from ( the time component of ) the covariant divergence of the z4 field equations  @xcite .",

    "we have included in the plot the exact ( reflection ) results for comparison .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath30-gate condition gets very close to ( actually slightly better than ) the exact result in this case .",
    "the pure advection condition ( [ advect ] ) is off by half - an - order of magnitude .",
    "however , a suitable damping term ( we have taken @xmath53 ) greatly improves this , leading in this case to even less error than the pure reflection condition .",
    "note that we are showing here the @xmath30 profiles , giving the cumulated energy - constraint deviation .",
    "the average energy - constraint error in these strong - field simulations is actually smaller .",
