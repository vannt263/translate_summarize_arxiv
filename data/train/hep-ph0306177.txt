    "<S> the decay amplitudes are analyzed in detail , paying the special attention to the adler condition of vanishing the whole amplitude at vanishing momentum of any final pion . combining the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule applied to the five pion final state , with the adler condition , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate also the @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the partial widths of the above decays are evaluated , and the excitation curves in @xmath4 annihilation are obtained , assuming reasonable particular relations among the parameters characterizing the anomalous terms of the hls lagrangian . the evaluated branching ratios @xmath5 and @xmath6 are such that with the luminosity @xmath7 attained at da@xmath8ne @xmath9 factory , one may already possess about 1685 events of the decays @xmath10 . </S>"
