    "for more than three decades , topological quantum systems have remained at the centre of attention in condensed matter physics.@xcite these diverse systems , from a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas exhibiting the integer quantum hall effect@xcite , to chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors and superfluids,@xcite to topological band insulators,@xcite all share one common feature : the quantum states in the bulk fall into distinct classes characterized by various topological invariants , which are robust under sufficiently small perturbations .",

    ", for single - particle hamiltonians the topological invariant either takes an integer value or is a @xmath1 quantity , although this may be significantly modified by interactions.@xcite    there is a widely held belief that a nontrivial topology of the bulk manifests itself in the presence of protected gapless quasiparticle states localized near the boundary of the system , which is known as the bulk - boundary correspondence.@xcite archetypal examples include the current - carrying chiral edge states in the quantum hall@xcite or topological band insulators,@xcite and also the andreev bound states ( abs ) in the chiral @xmath0-wave@xcite and the nodal @xmath2-wave superconductors.@xcite in some cases , it is possible to obtain an explicit analytical relation between the number of the zero - energy modes and a certain topological invariant in the bulk.@xcite for instance , the quantum - hall edge states are related to the first chern number of the 2d brillouin zone , which is also known as the tknn integer , after ref . , while the dispersionless surface abs in tr invariant unconventional superconductors are controlled by the phase winding number of the determinant of the off - diagonal bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian.@xcite note , however , that there are some recent results@xcite that call into question the universality of the bulk - boundary correspondence , at least in the @xmath1 case .    the extent to which the zero modes are `` protected '' , i.e. , insensitive to the boundary details , is one of the less - understood aspects of the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "given the crucial role played by trs , of particular interest here is the fate of the zero modes in the situations when the bulk is tr invariant , while the boundary is not .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the effects on the abs of ( i ) the magnetic boundary scattering and ( ii ) an intrinsic trs breaking in the superconducting state , both at the mean - field level and also including fluctuations .",
