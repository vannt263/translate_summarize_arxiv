    "are clearly elevated to as high as @xmath34 in 80@xmath35 interval ( compared with @xmath360.7 in average ) in the southwestern molecular intrusion region and the northwestern molecular patch ( corresponding to the two radio brightness peaks , respectively ) described above .",
    "for the @xmath37 ( 66.5@xmath38 ) component , although the ratios are weakly elevated in some boundary regions , the ratios are all below 0.9 .",
    "therefore the elevated @xmath4co @xmath5= 21/@xmath5= 10  ratios seem to better imply an interaction of the snr with the @xmath33 mcs than with the @xmath37 ones .",
    "we have carefully examined the co spectra in the field of view and presented the @xmath4co(@xmath390 ) , @xmath4co(@xmath401 ) , and @xmath23co(@xmath390 ) spectra extracted from two regions ( in the east and sw , as marked in the right panel in the fourth line of figure  [ f:4f ] ) in figure  [ f:2spec ] . around @xmath41 , the @xmath23co  line profiles are very similar to the @xmath4co  profiles for both the  east \" and  sw \" regions .",
    "both the @xmath4co  and @xmath23co  spectra of the  sw \" region have peaks at 84  km  s@xmath1 , with broad blue ( left ) wings in the line profiles .",
    "yet , it is difficult to judge whether the blue wings of the 84  km  s@xmath1 @xmath4co  lines are dynamically broadened or not , due to the significant blue wing of the @xmath23co  line and especially a distinct @xmath23co  peak at @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath23co  emission is usually optically thin and indicative of quiescent , intrinsically high - column - density mcs . for the  east \" region ,",
    "both the @xmath4co  and @xmath23co  spectra have peaks at 81  km  s@xmath1 ; notably , there is an additional broadening in the red ( right ) wing ( 8690  km  s@xmath1 ) of the 81  km  s@xmath1 @xmath4co  line , as compared with little @xmath23co  emission in the same velocity interval .",
    "it most likely indicates that the @xmath4co  emission in this interval results from the perturbation suffered by the 81  km  s@xmath1 molecular gas in the east of the remnant .",
    "although there is a velocity discrepancy between @xmath6 for the eastern region and @xmath3 for the western region , the undisturbed clouds in the snr field may have a wide velocity distribution , e.g. , the lsr velocity of mcs with which snr ic  443 interacts is in the range of @xmath42 to @xmath43 ( van dishoeck et al .",
    "1993 ; hewitt et al .",
    "thus the @xmath6 cloud in the east is very likely , together with the @xmath3 clouds , among the mcs shocked by snr 3c  396 .",
    "the above analysis show that both of the 69 and 84  km  s@xmath1 molecular components appear to have spatial correlation with snr 3c  396 , but the latter seems to have much better evidence than the former .",
    "we will further show that the 69  km  s@xmath1 clouds are in the foreground of snr  3c  396 , using the vgps radio and grs @xmath23co  data .",
    "the 1420 mhz continuum image ( figure  [ f : hi ] , upper left panel ) displays semicircularly brightened structure in the side roughly close to the galactic plane and faint emission in another side . following the method used in tian et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we produced the hi spectrum ( figure  [ f : hi ] , upper right panel ) of the radio peak region of the remnant .",
    "the maximum radial velocity of absorption features in the direction towards 3c  396 is up to the tangent point lsr velocity ( i.e. , @xmath18  84  km  s@xmath1 ) , and virtually no significant absorption feature appears at negative velocities .",
    "it indicates that the distance of snr 3c  396 is between 6.2  kpc ( the tangent point ) and 12.5  kpc ( the solar circle ) .",
    "here we have used the rotation curve in clemens ( 1985 ) with @xmath44  kpc ( reid 1993 ) and @xmath45  km  s@xmath1 and adopted the spiral model in taylor & cordes ( 1993 ; figure  1 therein ) .    the hi self - absorption ( sa ) measurement can provide another clue to the mcs distances .",
    "a single radial velocity indicates two distances ( the near and the far kinematic distances ) in the inner galaxy along the line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "mcs in the near distance often display hi sa features and many work have been carried out based on this property ( e.g. , liszt et al .  1981 ; jackson et al.2002 ; goldsmith & li 2005 ; busfield et al .",
    "2006 ; anderson & bania 2009 ; roman - duval et al .",
    "the hi sa property also seems effective in resolving kinematic distance ambiguity toward snr ",

    "2010 ) and ctb  109 ( tian et al .",
    "figure  [ f : hi ] ( lower panels ) shows the vgps hi and grs @xmath23cospectra of two regions ( as defined in the upper left panel ) near the remnant .",
    "the hi sa feature is clearly seen at 69  km  s@xmath1 associated with the @xmath23co  peak , which indicates that the 69  km  s@xmath1 molecular component is most probably located at the near distance along the los , i.e. , 4.3  kpc .",
    "this component seems to be a part of the 69.65  km  s@xmath1 mc complex grsmc  g039.34@xmath900.26 at the near side ( roman - duval et al .",
    "2009 ) , which is apparently outside the distance range 6.212.5  kpc inferred for snr  3c  396 .",
    "therefore we suggest that snr  3c  396 is more probably associated with the mcs at @xmath46  km  s@xmath1 . the derived column density and gas mass of some molecular features ( the northwestern patch , southwestern pillar and the tip , and the western wall ( figure  [ f : coregion ] ) )",

    "both the x - ray and radio emissions are bright in the western half and faint in the eastern half ( figures  [ f : otherrgb ] and [ f : xrayregion ] ) , which is probably because of the large - scale density gradient roughly perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "the bright side of the remnant is close to the galactic plane ( see figure  [ f : hi ] , upper left panel , in galactic coordinates ) .",
    "the bright x - ray , ir and radio emissions in the west are well confined by the thick molecular wall of the @xmath46  km  s@xmath1 component , which may suggest that the snr expansion is hampered there .",
    "this scenario is strengthened by the radio and ir brightness peaks and the soft x - ray patch in the southwestern edge , which are coincident with the  tip \" of the intruding finger / pillar of molecular gas . when the snr shock hits the dense molecular pillar or clumps ,",
    "it will be decelerated and thus the magnetic field be compressed and amplified .",
    "this can account for the prominent radio enhancement and sharp edge there .",
    "actually , the magnetic field in the sw of the remnant is found to be essentially tangential to the shell , which is probably because the random interstellar magnetic field has been chiefly swept up into the accumulated gas and compressed along with the remnant s shell ( patnaik et al .",
    "[ parenthetically , the tangential field ( patnaik et al .  1990 ) and the slightly enhanced radio emission in the northwestern edge are consistent with the presence of the dense molecular clump in the nw ( section  [ hico ] ) . ] in x - rays , the low electron temperature , normal metal abundance , and large ionization timescale ( as obtained from our spectral fitting ) of the soft southwestern x - ray patch can be naturally interpreted by the interaction with the dense molecular pillar .",
    "the ir morphology can also be accounted for with the scenario of shock interaction with western molecular gas , as discussed in the following .    in ir",
    ", there is a spatial separation between the inner near - ir 1.64  @xmath11 m [ feii ] and outer 2.12  @xmath11 m h@xmath10 emission filaments along the western edge of the remnant ( lee et al .",
    "2009 ; hewitt et al .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) interprets this morphology due to the snr shock overtaking the wind of a red supergiant ( rsg ) , giving rise to [ feii ] emission and the interaction with a dense circumstellar bubble , giving rise to h@xmath10  emission .",
    "such a rsg wind bubble 57  pc in radius invokes a 25@xmath87 progenitor .",
    "this mass assumption is different from our estimate of 13@xmath8 derived from the x - ray emitting metal abundances ( see below in section  [ progenitor ] ) and is not in agreement with the mass range @xmath88 calculated for the neutron star progenitors with metallicity @xmath89 ( heger et al .",
    "the 13@xmath8 progenitor of type - iip supernova ( see section  [ progenitor ] ) can only blow a rsg wind bubble of radius @xmath90  pc ( chevalier 2005 ) .",
    "however , the spatially separated [ feii ] and h@xmath10 emission can be interpreted in term of snr ",
    "mc interaction . as reach et al.(2005 ) and hewitt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest , the h@xmath10 emission can arise from the shock interaction with dense clumps while the [ feii ] emission can arise from the same shock encountering the less dense material at the clumps surface or from the ejecta .",
    "the bright 24  @xmath11 m mid - ir emission ( figure  [ f : otherrgb ] ) may chiefly come from the dust grains and even possibly from the ionic and molecular species in the shocked gas ( e.g. , tappe et al .",
    "2006 ; su & chen 2008 ) when the western molecular wall is hit by the blast wave . a spinning dust component is invoked to account for the spectral excess at 33  ghz ( scaife et al .",
    "2007 ) , and it seems that the needed dust may lie in the mcs and be heated by the shocked gas .",
    "all these evidences strongly point to a conclusion that snr 3c  396 is associated , and in physical contact , with the @xmath33 mcs .",
    "the lsr velocity 84  km  s@xmath1 corresponds to a galactic location near the tangent point , at a distance of @xmath91  kpc ; this distance is consistent with the range [ 6.212.5  kpc ( section  [ hico ] ) ] inferred from the hi absorption data .",
    "we also notice that a distance of 6.5  kpc suggested by hewitt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) based on the hydrogen column is very similar to our result .",
    "hereafter , we write the distance to 3c  396 as @xmath92 for scaling .    it was queried by patnaik et al .",
    "( 1990 ) whether the hii complex nrao  591 ( or u39.25@xmath90.07 ) , which looks projectively near 3c396 , is associated with the snr .",
    "since the complex is at @xmath2= 23  km  s@xmath1 with the far side distance of 12.1  kpc ( anderson & bania 2009 ) , it is not associated with the remnant .",
    "instead , it is very likely to be associated with the 22.46  km  s@xmath1 grsmc g039.24@xmath900.06 at the far side ( roman - duval et al .",
    "2009 ) .        according the above multiwavelength analysis , a general scenario for snr  3c396 can be established as this : the remnant collides with a molecular wall in the west , flanking a southwestern pillar of molecular gas , and expands in a low density region in the east ( but encountering a clump of backside molecular gas ) .",
    "the global dynamical evolution of the remnant can be inferred from the x - ray properties .",
    "adopting @xmath93  kev as the average postshock temperature in the interclump medium , we have the mean blast shock velocity @xmath94^{1/2}\\sim8.7{\\times 10^{2}}$ ]  km  s@xmath1 , where @xmath95 is the hydrogen atom mass and @xmath96 is the average atomic weight . assuming an adiabatic expansion and adopting the snr radius @xmath97  pc and the mean density of the interclump medium @xmath98@xmath56 , the snr s age is estimated as @xmath99  kyr and the explosion energy is @xmath100  erg ( where @xmath101 ) .",
    "the dynamical age estimated here is consistent to the ionization ages ( the time since passage of the shock wave ) of the x - ray emitting gas obtained from the spectral fit ( table  [ l : xray ] ) , except the region  w \" for which the ionization age seems relatively low .",
    "the thermal pressure of the x - ray emitting gas is about @xmath102  dynes  @xmath49 ( table  [ l : xray ] ) , which is about two order of magnitudes lower than that of the shock ram pressure @xmath103  dynes  @xmath49 , as derived from the h@xmath10 emission of the _ spitzer _ irs observation towards the southwestern region ( hewitt et al .",
    "similar pressure discrepancies have also been found in the cases of ic  443 ( moorhouse et al .",
    "1991 ) and 3c  391 ( reach & rho 1999 ) .",
    "such discrepancies can be explained if the western molecular gas is clumpy and there is a radiative shell between the hot gas and the dense molecular clumps ( chevalier 1999 ) .",
    "a radiative shock has been revealed by the _ spitzer _",
    "irs slit observation ( hewitt et al .",
    "2009 ) . on the assumption of a crude pressure balance between the hot gas and the radiative shell",
    ", we have ( chevalier 1999 ) @xmath104^{-2},\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the hydrogen atom density in the clump , @xmath106 the interclump density , and @xmath107 the density in the radiative shell . the gas density in the dense clump , @xmath108 ,",
    "was estimated for the southwestern region from the h@xmath10 lines by two groups of authors ( lee et al .",
    "2009 ; hewitt et al .",
    "considering that the x - ray emission represents the shock interaction with the interclump gas , we may assume @xmath106 is about 1/4 the density of the hot gas ( @xmath70 , see table  [ l : xray ] ) and thus is of order @xmath109 for the southwestern region .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath110 .",
    "this number is similar to the electronic density ( @xmath111 ) inferred from ionic lines ( hewitt et al .",
    "2009 ) .      in the north and south ,",
    "the @xmath33 co emission is very weak , the snr does not seem to encounter the molecular wall , and the x - ray emitting gas is found to be metal enriched ( table  [ l : xfit ] ) .",
    "we assume that the observed pattern of metal enrichment can reflect the composition of the supernova ejecta and thus be used to constrain the mass of the progenitor star ( following , e.g. , rakowski et al.2001 ; chen et al .",
    "2006 ) . as the presence of a pulsar implies a core - collapse nature of the sn , we plot the relative metal abundances predicted from such sn models for stars with normal metallicities ( @xmath112 ) ( thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 , hereafter tnh96 ; woosley & weaver 1995 , hereafter ww95 ) in figure  [ f : mass ] .",
    "the enrichment appears compatible with the ww95 model for a progenitor mass of @xmath113 or the tnh96 model for a progenitor mass of @xmath114 .",
    "a 13@xmath8 progenitor is a b1b2 star ( snow 1982 ) and ends its life as a type - iip supernova ( heger et al .",
    "we have investigated the molecular gas environment of the semicircular young composite snr 3c  396 in multiwavelengths , principally with @xmath4co  ( @xmath5=10 and @xmath5=21 ) and @xmath23co  ( @xmath5=10 ) observations in srao and pmod , and performed a _",
    "spatially resolved thermal x - ray spectroscopic study of the snr .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we confirmed a cavity - like structure of molecular gas at @xmath115@xmath38 in the 3c  396 snr region , which was noticed by lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) based on the grs @xmath23co  ( @xmath5=10 ) data .",
    "it is most probably to be located in the near distance ( @xmath86  kpc ) according to the hi sa measurement .",
    "we find a series of evidence suggesting that the molecular gas at @xmath18  84  km  s@xmath1 is in physical contact with snr 3c  396 , which can reasonably explain the multiwavelength properties of the remnant . around this lsr velocity",
    ", a molecular wall appears to perfectly confine the western boundary of the snr , which is bright in x - ray , ir , and radio emission .",
    "the co emission fades out from west to east , indicating that the eastern region is of low gas density , accounting for the radio `` blow - out '' morphology in the east of the remnant .",
    "a molecular pillar is revealed in the sw , with one end intruding inside the snr border . the shock interaction with this  pillar tip",
    "\" can explain the x - ray and radio enhancement in the sw and some infrared filaments there .",
    "mc interaction is also favored by the relatively elevated @xmath4co  @xmath5=21/@xmath5=10 line ratios at 80@xmath35 in the southwestern  tip \" and the molecular patch on the northwestern boundary .",
    "redshifted broadening ( 86@xmath116 ) is detected in the @xmath4cospectral line profiles of the eastern @xmath6 molecular patch and may be the kinematic evidence for shock  mc interaction .",
    "3 .   the establishment of the association between 3c  396 and the 84  km  s@xmath1 mcs results in a determination of the kinematic distance at @xmath117 to the remnant , which agrees with a location at the tangent point along the los . 4 .",
    "the diffuse thermal x - ray emitting gas is found to be metal enriched except in the southwestern x - ray enhancement , and the metal enrichment in the north and south implies that the supernova progenitor is a 13@xmath8 b1b2 star .",
    "the x - ray spectral analysis suggests an age of the remnant of @xmath7  kyr .",
    "there is a pressure discrepacy between the x - ray emitting gas and the ir emitting cloud shock in the west , which can be explained with the inhomogeneous molecular gas and radiative shells between the hot gas and the dense molecular clumps .",
