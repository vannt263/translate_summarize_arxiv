    "dynamical mean - field theory was introduced almost two decades ago by brandt and mielsch@xcite , who solved for the transition temperature into a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phase of the spinless falicov - kimball model at half filling .",
    "this work appeared shortly after the idea of examining strongly correlated electrons in the limit of infinite dimensions was introduced@xcite .",
    "since then , the field of dmft has emerged as one of the most powerful nonperturbative techniques for solving the many - body problem .",
    "while results for many properties exist in the homogeneous ( unordered ) phase@xcite , there has been little work in examining the properties of the ordered phase .",
    "brandt and mielsch worked out the formalism for calculating ordered - phase green s functions@xcite , the order parameter was shown to display anomalous behavior at weak coupling@xcite , and higher - period ordered phases have been examined on the bethe lattice@xcite .",
    "but , surprisingly , there has been no work on the transport properties in the ordered phase . indeed , it is interesting to compare how transport varies in the homogeneous phase versus the ordered phase . at weak coupling , we anticipate the gap formation of the cdw to greatly suppress the dc transport , while at strong coupling it may be a much milder correction to the mott - insulating behavior . what is more interesting is to examine the temperature dependence .",
    "for example , in systems that are metallic at high temperature , the many - body dos in the cdw phase develops strong temperature dependence ( with increasing @xmath0 ) as the cdw gap region fills in due to thermal excitations , until gap closure is complete at the transition temperature .",
    "but unlike the well - known superconducting case , where subgap states tend not to form and the gap is simply reduced in size as @xmath0 increases , here we have a rapid development of subgap states , even though the cdw order parameter remains nonzero .",
    "these subgap states should produce anomalous behavior in the low-@xmath0 transport , and indeed we find this is so but the quantitative behavior is not that different from exponential activation of the transport .",
    "we anticipate our results should be relevant to different experimental systems that display charge - density - wave order , especially in compounds which are three - dimensional like@xcite babio@xmath1 and ba@xmath2k@xmath3bio@xmath1 .",
    "this contribution is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the formalism for dmft in the ordered phase including the techniques needed to determine the optical conductivity and the dc transport .",
    "we also determine moment sum rules for the green s functions in the ordered phase . in section iii",
    ", we apply the formalism to numerical solutions of the falicov - kimball model at half filling and show how the transport behaves in the ordered phases .",
    "conclusions and a discussion follow in section iv .",
    "the falicov - kimball model@xcite was introduced in 1969 as a model for metal - insulator transitions in rare - earth compounds and transition - metal oxides .",
    "the spinless version is arguably the simplest many - body problem that nevertheless possesses rich physics including the mott transition , order - disorder phase transitions , and phase separation ( for a review see ref .  ) .",
    "it involves two kinds of electrons : mobile conduction electrons whose creation and destruction operators are @xmath4 and @xmath5 at site @xmath6 ; and localized electrons whose creation and destruction operators are @xmath7 and @xmath8 at site @xmath6 . the falicov - kimball hamiltonian can be represented in terms of a local operator and a hopping operator as follows @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hopping matrix and @xmath11 is the local hamiltonian with the number operators given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "if the lattice can be divided into two sublattices , and the hopping is nonzero only between the two sublattices ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , there is no hopping within either sublattice ) , then the lattice is called a bipartite lattice , and it has nesting at half filling in the noninteracting system , which implies the fermi surface in the brillouin zone has flat regions that are connected by the zone - diagonal wavevector @xmath14 .",
    "nesting promotes the formation of a cdw with the average filling of the electrons being uniform on each sublattice , but changing from one sublattice to another .",
    "this is often called the checkerboard or chessboard cdw , and is the ordered phase that we will examine in detail in this work .    @xmath15    in order to develop the formalism to determine the green s functions and transport in the ordered cdw phase , we need to introduce some notation that will help clarify how the ordered phase is determined .",
    "it is convenient to supplement the lattice site index , which we had been calling @xmath6 , by a double index @xmath16 , where @xmath6 runs over all of the lattice sites of one of the sublattices , and the label @xmath17 or @xmath18 denotes the sublattice ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cdw_ordering ] ; we are assuming for simplicity that the two sublattices have an equal number of lattice sites as they do on the infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice or on the infinite - coordination - number bethe lattice ) .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_def ] ) as @xmath19 with the local hamiltonian satisfying @xmath20 in this notation , the bipartite lattice condition is simply that @xmath21 .",
    "we have introduced different chemical potentials for the two different sublattices at the moment .",
    "this is convenient for computations , because it allows us to work with a fixed order parameter , rather than iterating the dmft equations to determine the order parameter ( which is subject to critical slowing down near @xmath22 ) . of course",
    ", the equilibrium solution occurs when the chemical potential is uniform throughout the system ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "our starting point is to find the set of equations satisfied by the lattice green s function .",
    "the green s function is defined to be @xmath25 / \\mathcal{z } , \\label{eq : green_def}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the imaginary time , the time dependence of the destruction operator is written in the heisenberg representation \\{@xmath27d_{ia}^{}\\exp[-\\tau\\mathcal{\\hat h}]$ ] } , and @xmath28 is the partition function @xmath29 $ ] , with @xmath30 the inverse temperature . the symbol @xmath31 is the time - ordering operator , which orders the times so that earlier times appear to the right .",
    "one way to calculate the green s function is to use an equation of motion technique@xcite , where the derivative with respect to imaginary time is taken and a differential equation is found for the green s function . in dmft , this procedure is carried out for the impurity problem in a time - dependent field , and the field is adjusted so that the impurity green s function is equal to the local lattice green s function .",
    "in addition , we need to define the self - energy via dyson s equation in order to complete the iterative dmft loop needed to solve the full problem . finally , an analytic continuation from the imaginary axis to the real axis is performed to calculate dynamical properties .",
    "these techniques are all well known and have been established in the literature@xcite , so we provide just a schematic approach to the derivation , highlighting some key formulas along the way .    the dyson equation , which can be thought of as defining the self - energy is @xmath32 g_{lj}^{cb}(\\omega )      = \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ab } , \\label{eq : dyson}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 the real frequency . in the case of nearest - neighbor hopping on an infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice , we have that the band structure satisfies @xmath34 t_{ij}^{ab}=-\\lim_{d\\rightarrow\\infty } t^{*}\\sum\\limits_{\\alpha=1}^d\\cos{k_{\\alpha}}/\\sqrt{d}$ ] , where we scaled@xcite the nearest neighbor hopping matrix element by @xmath35 ( we will use @xmath36 as our energy unit ) .",
    "in addition , the self - energy is local@xcite @xmath37 which further simplifies the dyson equation .",
    "it is simpler to transform from real space to momentum space to solve the dyson equation .",
    "but we do not assume that the green s function is completely translation invariant , instead , we assume only that there is translation invariance within each of the sublattices .",
    "then the momentum representation of the dyson equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson ] ) with the local self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_local ] ) becomes @xmath38^{-1 } ,     \\label{eq : matrix_dyson}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and the hopping term are represented by @xmath40 matrices @xmath41 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : twobytwo ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix_dyson ] ) and taking the matrix inverse yields the following formulas for the momentum - dependent green s functions on the lattice @xmath42 with @xmath43 defined by @xmath44[\\omega+\\mu^{b}_{d}-\\sigma^{b}(\\omega ) ] } , \\label{eq : barz_def}\\ ] ] which agree with those of brandt and mielsch@xcite even though our notation is somewhat different from theirs .",
    "the local green s functions on each sublattice then satisfy @xmath45 where the @xmath46 sublattice is different from the @xmath47 sublattice and @xmath48 is the hilbert transform @xmath49 the function @xmath50 is the noninteracting density of states , which is @xmath51 for the infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice ( as discussed above , we take @xmath36 ) .    in the dmft solution",
    ", we need to map the lattice problem onto a local ( impurity ) problem in a time - dependent field that is adjusted to make the impurity green s function equal to the local green s function of the lattice . here , we have two different local green s functions , one on the a sublattice and one on the b sublattice ; hence we will need two time dependent fields and two impurity problems to solve in order to complete the dmft mapping .",
    "we call the dynamical mean fields @xmath52 for each sublattice",
    ". then the solution of the impurity problem is straightforward and is summarized by the following set of equations @xmath53^{-1 } \\label{eq : g_loc_0 } \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{\\omega+\\mu^a_d-\\lambda^a(\\omega ) } , \\label{eq : lambda } \\\\",

    "the dmft algorithm for a fixed value of the order parameter starts by choosing @xmath55 and @xmath56 such that @xmath57 is fixed to the total @xmath58-electron filling ( the order parameter is @xmath59 ) , and choosing @xmath60 . with those fixed quantities ,",
    "we propose a guess for the self - energy on each sublattice , and then compute the local green s function on the real axis from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : barz_def ] ) and ( [ eq : g_loc_sublattice ] )",
    ". then we extract the dynamical mean field on each sublattice from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g_loc_0 ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda ] ) , then find the local green s function for the impurity from eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_loc_imp ] ) and the new self - energy from eq .",
    "( [ eq : self_energy_dyson ] ) .",
    "this loop is repeated until the green s functions converge .",
    "then one can calculate the filling of the @xmath61-electrons and adjust them until they match the target filling .",
    "but this procedure is not yet complete , because we need to determine the correct equilibrium order parameter @xmath62 at the given temperature . to find this , it is actually more convenient to perform the calculations precisely as described above , but on the imaginary frequency axis , where @xmath33 is replaced by @xmath63 the fermionic matsubara frequencies",
    ". then we calculate the chemical potential for the @xmath58-electrons on each sublattice via @xmath64 , \\label{eq : chem_pot_imag}\\ ] ] and adjust the order parameter until the two chemical potentials are equal , which is required for the equilibrium solution .",
    "then , when we calculate the green s functions on the real axis , the chemical potentials and fillings are all already known , so they do not need to be adjusted during the calculation .",
    "this algorithm is much more efficient than an algorithm that starts with a fixed chemical potential for the @xmath58-electrons and iterates to determine @xmath65 on the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "this is because the latter suffers from critical slowing down , and becomes quite inefficient near the critical temperature , whereas the calculations with the fixed order parameter converge quite rapidly regardless of how close one is to the critical point .",
    "when the dos is calculated for each sublattice in the ordered phase , one finds interesting temperature dependence of the subgap states as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "it is illustrative to discuss these evolutions in terms of the moments of the local interacting dos .",
    "it is well known , that in the homogeneous phase , the integral of @xmath66 is equal to 1 .",
    "but there are also exact results known for higher moments as well@xcite .",
    "in particular , because the moments are derived from operator identities , they continue to hold whether in the ordered phase or not .",
    "so we learn the following identities immediately : @xmath67 we have checked these moments versus our numerical calculations of the green s functions on the real axis and they all agree to high accuracy for all temperatures that we consider .",
    "note that at half filling , we have @xmath68 , so the first moment vanishes in the homogeneous phase . as the system orders , the first moment on one sublattice becomes negative , and the first moment on the other sublattice becomes positive , which indicates that the quantum states are shifting in response to the ordering .",
    "in particular , this redistribution of states causes the average kinetic energy to evolve more strongly with temperature in the ordered phase , but its evolution is anomalous , and can not be predicted by any simple reasoning about how the states evolve ( see below ) . the evolution of the average kinetic energy plays an important role in the total spectral weight for the optical conductivity .     for the cdw - ordered phase on a hypercubic lattice .",
    "panel ( a ) is for the @xmath69 sublattice and panel ( b ) is for the @xmath18 sublattice .",
    "four cases are plotted : @xmath70 which is a strongly correlated metal ; @xmath71 , where a dip develops in the normal - state dos at the chemical potential ; @xmath72 , which is a near - critical mott insulator ; and @xmath73 , which is a moderate - size - gap mott insulator .",
    "the @xmath74 gap in the dos is always equal to @xmath75 in the ordered cdw phase .",

    "in particular , only one term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_loc_imp ] ) survives on each sublattice and we immediately find @xmath78 and @xmath79 . plugging these results into the remaining formulas for the dmft algorithm then yields an analytic formula for the ordered phase dos @xmath80 \\rho\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2-\\frac{u^2}{4}}\\right ) , \\label{eq : dos_t=0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the top sign is for the @xmath69 sublattice ( with a divergence of the dos at @xmath81 ) and the bottom sign is for the @xmath18 sublattice ( with a divergence at @xmath82 ) ; the formula is restricted to half filling where @xmath83 .",
    "note that the two dos on each sublattice are mirror images of each other and that each sublattice has weight for positive and negative frequency , but the band that does not have the singularity ( lower band for sublattice @xmath69 and upper band for sublattice @xmath18 ) has shrinking spectral weight as @xmath75 becomes large , because the mobile electrons avoid the sites with the localized electrons for large @xmath75 .",

    "[ fig : u=0.5_dos ]  ( b ) ] .",
    "the mott insulating phases also illustrate interesting behavior .",
    "in particular , the subgap states develop primarily within the upper and lower hubbard bands ( although on the hypercubic lattice , the mott insulator has only a pseudogap with the dos strictly vanishing only at @xmath84 ) .",

    "but it is only the subgap states within the fermi window that affect the transport , so the modification is not quite as severe as one might have naively guessed . note the small wiggles in the solid lines at low @xmath0 .",

    "in this work we have developed the formalism to calculate transport properties of cdw - ordered phases within dmft . since the dc charge and heat transport and the optical conductivity continue to have no vertex corrections , even in the ordered phase , the calculations reduce to a careful evaluation of the bare feynman diagrams with a sublattice index introduced by the order .    as the system orders into a cdw state , the dos develops a gap with a sharp singularity in the dos at the band edge",
    "when @xmath74 .",
    "the gap at @xmath74 is always equal to @xmath75 . as the temperature increases , but still below @xmath22 , we see a significant development and evolution of subgap states within the gap region .",
    "this gap region where subgap states develop , appears to lie within the extent of the normal - state dos  in other words , in the mott insulator , we do not see subgap states develop within the region that corresponds to the mott gap in the normal state .",
    "we verify the accuracy of the dos calculations by calculating the zeroth , first , and second moment of the local dos on each sublattice and we find they agree with exact results to essentially machine accuracy .",
    "the optical conductivity has a significant rearrangement of states within the ordered phase , which can be understood by examining the different kinds of processes that take place within an optical transition  namely that we move from an occupied to an unoccupied state .",
    "because there are many different bands that are present at finite @xmath0 , this leads to significant structure in the optical conductivity .",
    "in particular , the singularity in the dos leads to a large asymmetric peak centered around @xmath75 in the response function .",
    "the total spectral weight is governed by the average kinetic energy due to the optical sum rule . while a naive expectation would say the average kinetic energy increases when the ordering is turned on ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , it becomes less negative with a smaller magnitude ) because the ordering blocks hopping between the sublattices , we find that is true only for small @xmath75 . for small @xmath75",

    "the kinetic energy shows a significant reduction ( _ i .",
    ", the magnitude increases as the average kinetic energy becomes more negative ) so the spectral weight increases when the ordered phase is entered , and that increase can become quite substantial as @xmath75 becomes large .",
    "finally , we also examined the dc transport .",
    "since we are at half filling , one can show the thermopower vanishes due to particle - hole symmetry even in the presence of cdw order .",
    "hence we can only examine the charge and heat conductivities .",
    "we find that the cdw order suppresses both of these , but because of the subgap states and their complicated evolution with temperature , the dc response does not obey any simple functional form at low @xmath0 . instead , we often see significant wiggles in the conductivities . in the mott - insulating phase",
    ", the conductivity should go from a power - law - like behavior to exponential activation .",
    "we see such a trend start to develop , but we can not accurately quantify this because we can not go down far enough in temperature in the cdw phase before we run into issues with accuracy of the calculations .",
    "this work shows that there is rich and interesting behavior that occurs in the transport as cdw order sets in . in future work",
