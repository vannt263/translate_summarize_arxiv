    "our knowledge of the different layers and structures of the solar atmosphere has improved greatly in the last decades .",
    "however , the structural fine - scale details of the atmosphere still leaves many open questions ( see the review papers of e.g. @xcite ) . a challenging task is to identify and catalogue the small - scale ,",
    "localised observable phenomena ( e.g. bushes , fibrils , flocculi , grains , mottles , spicules , etc . )",
    "present in the chromospheric zoo in regards of their numbers and variety .",
    "these , often rapidly appearing and disappearing , fine structures are popularly observed in e.g. the he ii ( @xmath0 nm ) emission line , h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 nm ) and ca ii ( @xmath3 nm ) absorption lines .",
    "one class of the set of highly dynamic phenomena are the spicules .",
    "they are abundant , spiky - like gas jets at the chromospheric solar limb @xcite .",
    "their upward mass flux is about 100 times that of the solar wind @xcite .",
    "spicules are detectable both on the disc ( often called as mottles ) and at the limb at any given moment of time .",
    "depending on their size and lifetime , spicules can be classed into two groups .",
    "spicules with @xmath4 km length , 5  15 min lifetime and 25 km s@xmath5 propagating speed are called `` classic '' or lately debatably referred to as type - i spicule @xcite .",
    "the other group is claimed to contain the smaller and faster ( @xmath6 km average height , @xmath7 km s@xmath5 propagation speed ) so - called type - ii spicule ( on disc often labelled as rapid blueshifted excursiors  rbes referring to one of their distinct observable properties ) with shorter lifetime , 10  150 s @xcite .",
    "spicules , irrespective of their lifetime and speed , could play an important role in the energy and momentum transportation from the photosphere to the chromosphere or low corona .",
    "their capability of guiding mhd waves are discussed by e.g. @xcite .",
    "there are , however , much larger spicule - like , also abundant , dynamic jets detected to be present in the solar atmosphere : macrospicules ( ms ) .",
    "the investigation of macrospicules reaches back at least 40 years .",
    "the first modern observation of macrospicules was carried out by @xcite . with the 30.4 nm spectroheliograph",
    "onboard the skylab mission , @xcite identified 25 ms with length of 8 `` to 25 '' ( some extreme cases were even with 30``-60 '' ) .",
    "their lifetime is about 8 to 45 minutes without any reported correlation at that time between the length and lifetime .",
    "most ms are formed inside coronal hole regions .",
    "their name , initially , was suggested to be `` euv macrospiclues '' after the wavelength band they were detected in .",
    "@xcite observed 32 macrospicules with the 25-cm aperture vacuum telescope at big bear solar observatory using h@xmath1 and @xmath8 filters during an observation campaign of 122 hours .",
    "the length ( 8 - 33 \" ) and lifetime ( 4 - 24 min ) of these ms were similar to those of reported in @xcite . @xcite investigated 10 ms by the uv spectroheliograph onboard the spacelab-2 mission .",
    "the properties of the ms found were similar , again , to those reported in the previous two studies , but the main innovation is the development of temporal resolution : spacelab-2 was able to observe macrospicules with a lifetime down to three minutes .",
    "the breakthrough came with the age of high - resolution spacecrafts : solar heliospheric observatory ( soho , @xcite ) opened new avenues in solar physics with much greater temporal and spatial resolution as before . in the context relevant for our paper",
    ", we recall that @xcite used soho / coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ) to investigate the physics of ms with the first multi - wavelength observation and described them as multi - thermal structures .",
    "the authors claimed that x - ray jets and euv ms are manifestation of the same physical phenomena underlying , which could be the source of the fast solar wind as well .",
    "they also described , first , an associated `` pre - existing bright point '' , which can be a sub - flare brightening .    in a follow - up study",
    "@xcite employed soho / cds to detect the rotational properties of ms .",
    "blue and red - shifted emission was observed on either side of the axis of ms above the limb , which suggests the rotation of ms .",
    "the rotation velocities increase with height , so the macrospicules they observed were labelled `` solar tornadoes '' .",
    "the separation of blue- and red - shifted regions on two sides of the macrospicule is clearly visible .",
    "@xcite investigated the density and temperature of ms .",
    "three datasets , taken by soho / cds and soho / normal incidence spectrometer ( nis ) were constructed .",
    "the first dateset contains information about the ms , while the two others are averaged and used as a `` background '' to reduce the noise of the first one .",
    "the subtraced spectra showed a number of new properties : ms density was about @xmath9 while the temperature is @xmath10 k. the employed noise - reduction technique gave an opportunity to investigate the motion and the trajectory of ms : a maximum velocity was found to be about 80 km @xmath11 during the entire lifetime .",
    "the maximum height , reached by ms , was reported to be @xmath12 km above the solar limb .",
    "the average speed of falling back was about 26 km@xmath13 .",
    "@xcite examined both on - limb and off - limb ms with the high - resolution spectroscopic capability of soho / solar ultraviolet measurements from emitted radiation ( sumer ) instrument . in case of two off - limb events",
    ", fast upward propagation was measured between mid - transition region ( n vii - 765 ) and the lower corona ( ne viii - 770 ) with @xmath14 . on - limb observations suggest that spicules can be precursors for macrospicules .",
    "@xcite analysed three macrospicules with four instruments ( hinode / sot , eis , xrt and soho / sumer ) .",
    "these co - aligned images revealed that macrospicules do not seem to appear in spectral line formed over 300000 k.    on the theoretical side , @xcite carried out one of the first numerical simulations for ms as a velocity - shock in the transition region .",
    "they employed the flash code @xcite to solve the two - dimensional mhd equations by implementing a val iiic solar temperature model @xcite .",
    "many properties of simulated ms match the above mentioned , observed lifetime , length , velocity .",
    "another new era of ms observation has began with the launch of solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) in 2010 @xcite .",
    "onboard the spacecraft , the atmospheric imaging assembly ( sdo / aia ) generates terabytes of full - disc data with 0.6 \" spatial and 12 s temporal resolution at e.g. 30.4 nm wavelength @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out a detailed description of the evolution of an individual ms .",
    "this jet occurred in the north polar corona on 2010 november 11 with nearly 24 minutes lifetime and 40 mm height . based on its detailed observational description",
    ", a two - dimensional numerical simulation was performed using the val iiic initial atmospheric model @xcite .",
    "a small - scale magnetic flux tube emerged from the sub - photospheric layers into the previously existed open magnetic field , than underwent on kink - oscillation .",
    "the authors claimed that this kinking motion is the source of the ms .",
    "flux - emerging model is one of the widely accepted theory of solar jets ( for review of this topic , see @xcite ) .    according to the study by @xcite , using sdo / aia data , the spatial distribution of macrospicules shows inhomogeneous but systematic properties .",
    "it is known that the latitudinal distribution of ms concentrates around the poles . however , from the study of @xcite the longitudinal distribution also shows inhomogeneous properties .",
    "the longitudinal positions tend to focus around certain belts which suggests that there is a relationship between the position occurrence and the generation of the global magnetic field .    taking advantage of the uninterrupted observations of sdo , @xcite built up a dataset with 101 ms covering observation of a 2.5 year - long time interval .",
    "the authors claim that features like maximum length ( @xmath15 mm ) , upflowing velocity ( @xmath16 ) and lifetime ( @xmath17 min ) are varying in time systematically .",
    "cross - correlation of maximum length - maximum velocity and lifetime - maximum length showed a significant correlation ( @xmath18 ) , however the correlation coefficient is much smaller in the case of maximum velocity and lifetime ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "ballistics of ms were investigated as well , which indicates a strong influence of gravity in the rise and fall of ms .",
    "taking stock of the ballistics and two characteristic density values of ms ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , the authors estimated the formation energy @xmath22 for 25 , 5 , 1 , and 0.5 mm scale heights and @xmath23 for uniform plasma distribution cases .    in this study , we focus on the statistical investigation of the temporal behaviour of ms on timescales spanning considerably longer than previous studies , i.e. for a time interval of just under 6 years .",
    "this extended temporal investigation yields the opportunity to analyze the temporal variation of ms properties and the detection of the oscillatoric behavior of their properties on about by - annual time scales , well - beyond the life - time of individual ms . in section  [ database ] , we introduce the way the database was built up . in section  [ results ] , we discuss the results of the statistical analysis .",
    "we outline our discussion and conclusions in the last section .",
    "the source and driving force of majority of solar phenomena is the large - scale , global magnetic field , which varies on a long - term , e.g. 11-year time period .",
    "however , the temporal behaviour of jets is always considered in short time - scale",
    ". that may be the reason , why previous studies investigated only a few ms over a short time period .",
    "the temporal ranges of jet evolution are much shorter than the characteristic timescale of the solar cycle",
    ". therefore , investigation of the properties of short time - scaled macrospicules over a long - time time period is still an uncharted territory with some interesting questions to answer to . to achieve this objective ,",
    "an instrument is required i ) to have high temporal and spatial resolution to properly resolving the jets themselves , and ii ) to operate continuously for multiple years in order to investigate long - term evolution in statistical sense .",
    "the ideal choice is sdo , which was launched in june 2010 , near to solar minimum between solar cycles 23 and 24 .",
    "the operation of sdo for a period of about 6 years , as of writing , provides a great opportunity to acquire the long - term temporal variation of the properties of ms in regards to the current solar cycle .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ lit ]      in a next step , we now propose to aquire , whether there is any correlation between the properties of ms found . for this reason ,",
    "selected properties are plotted against each other . to show whether any two properties correlate , a linear fitting is applied to the data distribution .",
    "this fit is displayed in figure  [ crosscorr ] .",
    "the correlation coefficients ( @xmath24 ) were determined also , which seems to have a relatively small value for both ch ( @xmath25 $ ] ) and qs ( @xmath26 $ ] ) type ms .",
    "this suggests , that there is no strong correlation between the different properties of ms in general . in both cases ,",
    "only a small number of combinations show stronger correlations .",
    "`` maximum length vs maximum area '' ( @xmath27 ) , `` maximum width vs maximum area '' ( @xmath28 ) and `` maximum length vs average velocity '' ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) seem to have relatively strong correlation for both ch - ms and qs - ms .",
    "a correlation between datasets can not be negligible if the correlation coefficient is greater than around @xmath31 . in this respect",
    "the above stronger correlations seem to be logical , as area data are derived from the length and width . further ,",
    "`` maximum area vs average velocity '' ( @xmath32 ) and `` maximum area vs maximum lifetime '' ( @xmath33 ) pairs indicate a stronger correlation for qs - ms only .",
    "next , there is a visible gap between ch - ms and qs - ms in their average correlation coefficient ( @xmath34 ) and the ratio of the correlation coefficient is also greater than 0.6 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "the source of these differences may root in the underlying governing physical differences between the two types of ms , which should be clarified in a future research , that is not within the scope of the present paper .    by enquiring the large - scale time - dependence , i.e. solar cycle evolution , in this study , an interesting effect is visible .",
    "namely , in figure  [ crosscorr ] , the change of marker color represents the march of time .",
    "red marks shows the value of an ms property around june 2010 and the sequential color variation into blue captures the progress in time . by following the conversion of color from red to blue leads to a trajectory in each figure . in some aspects , at least conceptually , these paths are similar to different branches in the well - known hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) . to characterize these paths in time ,",
    "the entire problem is simplified to a geometrical problem .",
    "fix points of these distributions became the geometrical center of `` mass '' , which are marked by a green star in each panel of figure  [ crosscorr ] . to give a correct distance of each points from this center point ,",
    "all the properties are normalized due the different magnitudes of values ( e.g. lifetime values are three magnitudes greater , than maximum width values ) .",
    "after normalization , the geometric distance can be easily worked out . as the cross - correlation distributions suggested , strong temporal variation is visible in all cases in figure  [ distplot ] .",
    "multiple strong oscillations are visible in these plots on short timescale ( @xmath37 2 years ) .",
    "further , the characteristics of the obtained distance curves are different between ch and qs macrospicules , but there is a dominant peak around the first half of 2012 in the majority of the distance plots .",
    "all of these suggest that there is a deterministic underlying temporal variation in the raw data , which was not known earlier to the best of knowledge of these authors .",
    "future research of the oscillatory pattern may found here connect macrospicules to oscillatory behaviour found in other , large - scale solar phenomena , already reported to show a quasi - biennial oscillation @xcite or oscillations with even shorter periods , e.g. found by @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is to yield a more accurate and precise statistically relevant characteristic study of the physical properties of macrospicules . for this reason ,",
    "a dataset is built by means of analysing 301 ms over a 5.5 year - long time interval between june 2010 and december 2015 .",
    "the raw data were obtained by sdo / aia using the 30.4 nm wavelength band , where the ms jets were detected at the solar limb .",
    "the underlying fundamental principle of this database is to form and apply a range of criteria to ms , which can be summarized into five points . in order to gather information about each ms , which fits well the required criteria at every frame of their lifetime ,",
    "these jets are fitted with tetragons .",
    "the diagonals between the edges of the tetragon represents the physical dimensions of the ms such as length and width .",
    "five observed properties of ms were analysed in this study : maximum length , maximum width , average upflow velocity , maximum area , lifetime .",
    "taking advantage of this dataset , the spatial distribution of some key parameters of ms was investigated first . because active regions were excluded from the solar area of investigation by definition , where ms could be identified , the observed jets are found to be at high(er ) solar latitudes .",
    "ch jets accumulate around the solar poles due to the large - scale open magnetic field of polar coronal holes .",
    "quiet sun ms form a `` ring '' around them . further",
    ", a strong asymmetry is visible in the number of ch - ms between the hemispheres .",
    "the number of ch - ms on the southern hemisphere is almost three times larger , than that of the northern hemisphere .",
    "the source of this difference may be the solar dynamo as that was shown for e.g. sunspot area @xcite .",
    "future research in this topic should seek for a connection between asymmetry indexes of multiple magnetic structures .",
    "distributions of ms properties in time show a strong temporal variation . to have accurate estimates for the average properties ,",
    "the temporal variation was put aside and their histograms were studied initially . each histogram was fitted with a log - normal distribution and their preferences ( e.g. mode , mean , median , distribution ) were determined to characterise the ms . comparing our findings to those of the previous studies ( note , that values here are 1@xmath38 distribution of the log - normal distributions ) we conclude that : lifetime ( @xmath39 min ) , width ( @xmath40 mm ) , average velocity ( @xmath41 km s@xmath5 ) values are in an agreement , while length ( @xmath42 mm ) is slightly greater .",
    "correspondence between the results found in this research and those in the literature verify the choice of the tetragon assumption .",
    "last but not least , cross - correlation of the raw data was investigated . fitting a linear and cross - correlated ,",
    "there is often a lack of a dominant correlation ( @xmath34 ) . in three cases ,",
    "however , the coefficients are found to be relatively strong for both types of ms . for qs - ms , further two combinations of physical parameters ( e.g. `` maximum area vs average velocity '' and `` maximum area vs maximum lifetime '' )",
    "show a stronger correlation , which may reveal the underlying physical differences between the formation of ch - ms and qs - ms . considering",
    "the temporal evolution of these distributions , remarkable paths became visible in cross - correlation visualisations . to study this behaviour ,",
    "the distances between the center of mass and each points were determined . these distance plots in time reveal a strong , previously unseen temporal variation in the database .",
    "@xcite found that variation of the frequency shift of the global @xmath43-mode oscillation is a superposition of two oscillators : a stronger one , which has the well - known 11-years long oscillation and a weaker one , where the period is around two years .",
    "these oscillations are named as quasi - biennial oscillations ( qbos ) and discovered first by @xcite .",
    "qbqs were found in many _",
    "global _ solar phenomena .",
    "@xcite found that the reconstructed dataset of the line depth of three photospheric line over 25 years shows a qbo . @xcite investigated the stability of magnetic rossby waves in the solar tachocline and their results indicate a rossby wave harmonic with a period of @xmath442 years , a possible source of qbos .",
    "@xcite suggests that the source of these oscillations could be a second dynamo layer near to the solar surface .",
    "@xcite also found qbos in measuring proxies of the magnetic field in the sun .",
    "lately , @xcite constructed a double dynamo - layer model , which is able to excite qbos . if _",
    "solar features like ms , by means of statistical investigation of their properties during solar cycle time scales show a similar behaviour , that would suggest a connection between _ local _ dynamics ( e.g. ms ) and the evolution of _ global _ magnetic field ( e.g. solar cycle ) , an unrevealed question with great potentials .",
    "therefore , this will be the focus of our follow - up research ."
