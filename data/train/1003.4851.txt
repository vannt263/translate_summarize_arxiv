    "in this article , we consider data analysis performances of several inspiral templates for nonspinning compact binaries , used by the lsc algorithms library ( lal ) .",
    "these routines are compared with the tayloret template with respect to the numerical values of the fitting factor ( ff ) and the faithfulness [ ] .",
    "the task is to find out whether they can be used as effective and faithful search templates if the detectors strain data is assumed to provide the tayloret approximant .",
    "we give a short introduction to all the considered post - newtonian ( pn ) model waveforms .    *",
    "the taylort1 approximant [ ] employs the instantaneous gravitational wave ( gw ) angular velocity @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the far - zone flux of the pn accurate energy @xmath2 , for an evolution equation of both gw phase @xmath3 and @xmath0 at time @xmath4 , @xmath5 * the taylort4 approximant ( not used in lal ) is a slightly modified version of t1 and uses , as the only difference to t1 , a taylor - expanded version of the ratio in eq .",

    "all the necessary references and explicit formulas , partly only given with dots here , can be extracted from the investigation we like to summarize shortly [ ] .",
    "for our data analysis considerations , the _ time domain _ gw forms are constructed in the following way . the orbital evolution is set to start at the initial instant @xmath10 when the instantaneous gw frequency of @xmath11 kicks in the detectors bandwidth .",
    "it is necessary to transform @xmath11 into the binding energy in a pn accurate way for the et waveform and to let @xmath11 or @xmath2 evolve due to the model .",
    "the upper boundary for the gw frequency is that of the last stable circular orbit of a black hole having the total mass @xmath12 of the binary system .",
    "the merger and ringdown phases are excluded from our analysis .",
    "for the equal - mass case , the investigation showed up that for all three employed interferometer models , the systematic errors of the estimated masses continuously rise from @xmath13 to the order of magnitude of @xmath14 when going from @xmath15 to @xmath16 solar masses , supposing that the tayloret is the signal and taylort1 and t4 are taken to be the templates .",
    "the fitting factors have a minimum at the mass in the signal of @xmath17 , which is always below @xmath18 .",
    "additionally , the ff values are _ always _ below @xmath18 for advanced ligo and virgo for all the considered cases . for the unequal - mass case ,",
    "the results behave qualitatively somewhat different . to give representative numbers ,",
    "let us show the following table for @xmath19 ( for the @xmath20 signal family ) and advanced ligo at 3.5pn order , presenting the ffs , the ratios of the estimated total mass with respect to the signal s one , and the estimated @xmath7 , as functions of template masses in the first row .",
    ".ffs & estimated ( @xmath21 ) for several signal masses , @xmath19 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it is clearly visible , our code evaluated the ff at large biases of the estimated total mass @xmath22 and mass ratio @xmath23 .",
    "we can not give a full overview here and like to refer to the more detailed presentation of the numerical results [ ] .",
    "one result of this investigation is that fitting factors for @xmath24% for unequal - mass binaries can be only achieved at the cost of highly biased @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the faithfulness for the t1 and et comparison turned out to be @xmath25 .",
    "this investigation is only able to sketch the efficiency of capturing one model with the other .",
    "the question to be asked is what kind of analytic waveform is closer to reality can partly be answered by numerical relativity ( nr ) , which is only able to model few gw cycles at the end of the binary inspiral .",
    "it turned out that the taylort4 waveform is , for some cases , very close to nr .",
    "with respect to other waveforms that are closer to nr in the sense of matched filtering , it has unfavorable properties like artificial introduction of large parameter biases .",
    "this investigation confirms what has been presented in more detail in another recent work [ ] and has been extended for tayleret to eccentric orbits [ ] , where in the latter case we are left with the demanding question for numerical results for the eccentric inspiral .",
