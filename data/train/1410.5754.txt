    "interacting galaxies are known to trigger bursts of star formation , although this statement is toned down when considering selection biases and the weak contribution of mergers relative to main sequence galaxies to star formation in the universe @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a merger event remains a major milestone in the star formation history of a given galaxy .",
    "since mergers provide a wide range of physical conditions for star formation , it is likely that they also account for the diversity of observed dense stellar systems , from associations to globular clusters and possibly ultra compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "what type of stellar objects can be formed in a merger , as opposed to a more regular formation in an isolated galaxy , and under which conditions , remains poorly understood .    for several decades",
    ", simulations have been an efficient tool to study the morphology of interacting galaxies and mergers , and comparing the physics of their star formation with isolated cases .",

    "hydrodynamical simulations established a link between pericenter passages and bursts of star formation ( lasting a few @xmath0 ) and have began to explore the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the formation of massive star clusters in mergers @xcite .    because of technical limitations , previous simulations were not able to fully probe the scale of star forming clouds ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the coupling between the kpc - scale dynamics and the physics of star formation has been established using high resolution simulations of isolated galaxies @xcite .",
    "using simulations of mergers , @xcite underlined the dependance of the simulated star formation rate ( sfr ) with resolution , and thus the importance of resolving parsec - scale star forming structures .",
    "however , the computational cost of considering two galaxies , their tidal features spanning huge volumes and the highly fragmented nature of the ism prevented them to reach numerical convergence in their estimate of the sfr .",
    "( their simulation reached a resolution of @xmath2 , and did not include stellar feedback . )    other numerical works focussed on the formation of star clusters in mergers , highlighting the possible formation of very massive clusters in the nuclear regions of remnants or during the collision stages @xcite , emphasising relations between the radial position of clusters and their internal properties like metallicity @xcite and age @xcite , and proposing mergers to be one formation channel of massive globulars @xcite .",
    "these pioneer simulations faced the technical challenges of resolving star clusters and probing their intermediate mass regime ( @xmath3 ) . with the present day computational ressources , we are able to push these limits to the parsec scale , smaller masses and account for more detailed physics .    the antennae galaxies ( ngc  4038/39 , arp  244 ) have received a particular attention , both from the observational and the numerical sides , being the closest major merger in the starburst phase ( @xmath4 , @xcite , see also @xcite ) . several regions , and not only the galactic nuclei , host the formation of very massive stellar objects ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xcite ) . in total , more than 1000 star clusters have been detected in the central @xmath7 of the antennae .",
    "the richness of this system and the profusion of observational constraints make the antennae an excellent benchmark for theories and simulations on the role of merger in ( re-)shaping the structural properties of galaxies and of their stellar populations .    in this paper",

    "the gain from previous works in term of resolution and physics implemented allows us to better describe the formation and early evolution of stellar systems by probing smaller objects and resolving the inner structure of the most massive cases . @xcite",
    "used this simulation to establish a relation between the compressive nature of the tides and the interstellar turbulence in mergers and the enhancement of star formation . here , we focus our analysis on the properties of the stellar populations formed during the several stages of the interaction .",

    "the simulation has been run using the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ramses @xcite . the overall method and",
    "parameters are comparable to those used in the simulation of the milky way by @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the use of a thermodynamical model including heating by ultraviolet radiation of cosmic origin , and atomic cooling tabulated at solar metallicity by @xcite , as in @xcite .",
    "the minimum allowed temperature is set to 50 k to prevent numerical artefacts @xcite .",
    "the use of such heating / cooling scheme allows for deviations from the otherwise simpler polytropic equation of state of @xcite , in particular at low densities and high temperatures , a common situation in galaxy mergers where tidal interactions can eject a significant fraction of the ism from the galactic discs .",
    "gas denser than @xmath9 is converted into stellar particles ( called stars hereafter , for simplicity ) of minimum mass of @xmath10 , with an efficiency of 2 per cent per free - fall time .",
    "this sets the star formation rate to @xmath11 before the interaction .",
    "the newly formed stars inject feedback energy in the form of photo - ionisation in hii regions , radiation pressure @xcite and type - ii supernova thermal blasts @xcite .",
    "to speed - up the computation , only one out of ten young stellar particles ionises its surrounding ism , but with an energy ten times higher than a single source . since stars form in a clustered way in the dense gas regions , each of these regions hosts at least one ionising source , such that our simplification does not alter the global energy budget at the scale of molecular clouds .",
    "the refinement strategy adopted is `` quasi - lagrangian '' ( as in @xcite ) : an amr cell is refined when it contains more than a given number ( @xmath12 ) of particles ( dark matter and stars from the initial conditions ) , or when its baryonic density ( stars and gas ) exceeds a certain value ( which obviously depends on the refinement level of the cell ) .",
    "furthermore , the code ensures that the jeans length is always resolved by at least four cells .",
    "the maximum resolution is @xmath8 in the most refined volumes of the @xmath13 computational domain .",
    "the dark matter and stellar components from the initial setup ( as opposed to the stars formed during the simulation ) of each of the two galaxies are rendered with @xmath14 millions particles and evolved using a particle - mesh technique at the resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "these components provide a `` live '' background potential on top of which the ism and the young stellar objects can evolve .",
    "the stars formed from the gas are evolved using the resolution of the amr grid , i.e. up to @xmath8 .    due to the softening of the gravitational force on the stars ,",
    "the two - body interaction is not properly described in our simulation and related processes could not be probed .",
    "for instance the internal evolution of star clusters driven by two - body relaxation is not accounted for in this work .",
    "we argue later that the relaxation time of such objects is much longer than the time - lapse considered in our analysis , i.e. mainly the duration of the galactic interaction ( see section  [ sec : cfr ] ) .",

    "such structures may create a phase reference point which would play an important role in the shaping of the tidal features , and the transfer of angular momentum within the central regions of the discs .",

    "following the evolution for a longer time would be numerically costly and may require to account more precisely for cosmological aspects like the environment of the pair @xcite .      in the following , stellar objects in the galaxy merger are compared to those detected , using the same methods , in the simulation of the milky way ( mw ) presented in @xcite .",
    "the maximum resolution of this simulation is @xmath19 , i.e. 32 times higher than that of the antennae .",
    "however , only a few myr have been simulated at this resolution . to ease the comparison with the antennae , we use a slightly earlier snapshot from the mw , when the resolution is set to @xmath8 ( i.e. @xmath20 before the instant pictured in the figure 4 of @xcite ) , but already when the large - scale structures ( spirals and bar ) of the galaxy are in place and host star formation .",
    "the two simulations differ in term of the cooling scheme adopted : the milky way simulation uses a piecewise polytropic equation of state while ultraviolet heating and atomic cooling are invoked for the antennae run .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the difference between the two schemes is negligible , at least in the dense , star - forming gas .",
    "therefore , the physical properties of the stellar objects from both simulations are directly comparable .          the reference time @xmath21 corresponds to the first pericenter passage , occurring @xmath22 after the start of the simulation .",
    "a long pre - collision phase is required to eliminate possible artefacts in the initial setup of the galactic discs , and for the galaxies to start separated by a sufficient distance so that they would not experience strong tidal effects at setup .",
    "[ fig : morphology ] shows a sequence of snapshots extracted at various time along the collision .",
    "contrary to the tidal tails which do not host much star formation , the gaseous component of the tidal bridge ( i.e. the elongated structures of tidal origin , connecting the two galaxies ) rapidly fragments into dense clumps .",
    "self - gravity takes over the strong extensive ( i.e. destructive ) tidal field , the clouds collapse and further form stars in a compact , clustered fashion .",
    "the clustered nature of star formation , followed by the elongation of these structures by tidal and orbital effects is visible in the outer parts of the progenitors .",
    "some of the gas clouds and star clusters remain close to the gravitational lagrange point of equilibrium between the two galaxies , but most of them fall back at high speed ( up to @xmath23 ) toward one or the other progenitor .",
    "note that this process allows for material from one disc to be accreted onto the other .",
    "although this has little importance in our simulation , it may be a key aspect for mixing the gaseous and stellar material when very different galaxies are involved in the merger ( e.g. non - coeval or with different metallicities , sfrs etc . ) .",

    "the simulation is run until the beginning of the final coalescence",

    "[ fig : sfr ] displays the evolution of the sfr along the interaction . as noted by numerous previous studies ,",
    "episodes of intense star formation occur at the times of pericenter passages and at the beginning of the final coalescence of the two galaxies @xcite .",
    "the details of the bursts ( shape , intensity ) depend on the physics resolved by the simulation , in particular the ability to capture the turbulence cascade @xcite . using the simulation presented here and the same setup at lower resolutions , we have shown in @xcite that the global sfr becomes independent of the numerical resolution when it reaches @xmath30 .",
    "we also explained that compressive tides generated by the galactic encounters inject turbulent energy into the ism .",
    "in such turbulence , the compressive component overtakes the solenoidal one , which creates an excess of dense gas , leading to an intense episode of star formation .",
    "this process triggers star formation not only in the central regions of galaxies but also over extended volumes , several kpc away from the galactic nuclei .",
    "after the first starburst , the sfr drops by a factor of 2.5 ( @xmath31 ) before rising again within @xmath6 , and slowly declining as the progenitors separate .",
    "this drop corresponds to the end of the star formation in the tidal debris , in particular in the tidal bridges between the two galaxies .",
    "this results from the lowering of the gas density in these regions because of both consumption to form stars , and dynamical evolution of the cloud leading to its elongation and dilution of gas .",
    "large volumes within the discs still host star formation , which maintains a global sfr @xmath32 . a few myr later , tidal debris from the bridges and the tails fall back into the galaxies , either collide with other gaseous structures or simply get compressed along their orbit .",
    "this fuels a secondary episode of star formation , at a lower rate than the initial starburst : @xmath33 on average , with short and localized bursts reaching @xmath34 .",
    "this process continues during the entire separation of the galaxies and the global sfr decreases to @xmath35 just before the second pericenter passage .",
    "the second encounter also triggers a rapid rise of the sfr , but at this stage , it becomes involved to identify the peaks of the global sfr and connect them to their physical cause .",
    "dynamical friction prevents the galaxies to separate significantly after the second passage : the maximum distance between the nuclei is @xmath36 , i.e. less than the radii of the stellar discs .",
    "in other words , the two gas reservoirs continuously overlap for @xmath37 .",
    "gravitational torques drive inflows of gas toward the nuclei @xcite . at the same time , collisions between gas structures ( spiral arms , clumps ) occur more frequently than at the first passage because of a smaller impact parameter @xcite . these processes , in addition to the compression by tides and turbulence @xcite , trigger a new starburst episode .",
    "the peak of the sfr corresponds to the merger of the two nuclei , leading to a short ( @xmath6 ) but intense ( up to @xmath38 ) star formation episode .",
    "this point is further discussed in section  [ sec : cfr ] .",
    "the sfr curve in fig .  [ fig : sfr ] already indicates the very different nature of the two main bursts . in our setup , both bursts of star formation yield , at first order , an exponential decline with characteristic timescales of @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "furthermore , the full burst episode , i.e. the rather sharp rise of the sfr followed by a slower decline can be roughly fitted by a log - normal functional form . in that case",
    ", the skewness of the function is about three times larger for the first burst than for the second .",
    "this shows the differences between ( i ) the long - range effect of the tidal compression at the first burst , ( ii ) the slow decrease of the sfr during the separation of the progenitor , and ( iii ) the direct collision between the discs and their nuclei at the second and third encounters .    after the third passage ,",
    "the nuclei start to coalesce .",
    "the damped modulation in the peaks of the sfr for @xmath41 corresponds to the oscillations of the two nuclei around each other , while dynamical friction makes them loose orbital energy , making each nucleus - nucleus passage less and less efficient at triggering a central starburst .",
    "note that the same behaviour is commonly found in the mass fraction in compressive tides @xcite .",
    "although the numerical cost of the simulation prevents us from evolving the system for a long post - coalescence period , a complementary run at the resolution of @xmath42 indicates that the sfr resumes its pre - interaction level at @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 after the last starburst .",
    "therefore , when including the rise of sfr just before the first passage , the full episode of enhanced star formation lasts @xmath45 .",
    "the best match with observations being reached at @xmath46 , we note that the sfr has declined and increased again before reaching the present day , by a factor up to @xmath47 during the last @xmath48 , which contradicts the assumption of a constant sfr made by @xcite to interpret the observed age distribution of clusters in the antennae .",
    "a longer time - lapse between the pericenter passages would allow the sfr to reach a relatively constant value after the first starburst and would thus be more consistent with the assumption of @xcite . in our simulation ,",
    "the sfr averaged over the last @xmath48 is higher than the present - day value .",
    "therefore , assuming a constant sfr based on the observed value leads to an underestimate of the dissolution rate of clusters in that age range .",
    "this would then support the idea of @xcite and @xcite that the age function of star clusters is mainly due to their dissolution and not their formation rate , but not for the reasons these authors claim .",
    "however , the lack of observed older clusters ( @xmath49 ) in the antennae is explained by all models by the low sfr ( @xmath50 ) before the first encounter , i.e. by a formation process rather than a disruption one .    table  [ tab : sfr ] indicates the stellar mass formed during the three major phases of the merger . despite their physical differences , the main two starburst episodes produce the same amount of stars , in comparable time - lapses .",
    "furthermore , the phase of separation hosts a non - constant yet continuous formation of stars , producing 1.5 times more stellar mass than each burst , although it does not count any major starburst episode itself .",
    "in other words , the interaction produces more stars during the separation than during each individual starburst episode .    ) , compared to the global sfr . extended star formation exists throughout the merger , except at the second starburst episode ( associated with the third pericenter passage and the final coalescence , @xmath51 ) when it is almost exclusively central , due to gas inflows .",

    "the cfr suddenly drops by a factor @xmath70 showing indeed that star formation only proceeds in already formed clusters , and in the galactic nuclei .",
    "this remains valid during the separation of the galaxies , and even for the second major starburst episode ( @xmath71 ) meaning that the vast majority of clusters are formed by the first galactic encounter .    ) .",

    "[ fig : compressive ] illustrates the spatial correspondance between the three aspects , short after the first pericenter passage .",
    "although a delay of @xmath74 exists between the initial tidal trigger and its effect on the star formation rate , we confirm that almost all young star clusters are found inside tidally and turbulently compressive regions .",
    "such large - scale effects trigger star ( cluster ) formation over spatially extended volumes , and not only in the galactic nuclei . however , the shorter impact parameters of the second and third encounters imply a more important role of gas inflow onto the nuclei",
    ". therefore , star formation occurs mostly in the nuclei and not in a number of star clusters at various distances from the centre as it does during the first pericenter passages . at @xmath75 , 82 per cent of the young stars ( @xmath76 )",
    "form in the central @xmath77 of the merger , in the galactic nuclei , and thus do not form new clusters : the cfr remains low despite a burst of the sfr .",
    "note that the non - equality between the cfr and sfr does not invalidate the fact that all stars form in clusters : in our simulation , stars can form in pre - existing clusters ( or in the galactic nuclei ) , such that the sfr remains high despite a zero or small cfr .",
    "to further investigate the formation of clusters , we define three quantities : ( 1 ) the epoch when a cluster has formed 10 per cent of its final mass , i.e. a proxy for the beginning of its star forming episode , ( 2 ) the epoch when it has formed 90 per cent of its mass , i.e. a proxy for the end of its star forming episode , and ( 3 ) the difference of the two , i.e. the duration of the star forming episode . setting our thresholds to 10 and 90 per cent instead of 0 and 100 avoids the contamination by isolated star forming episode in the lowest mass clusters , where the star formation history is sensible to poisson s noise .",
    "[ fig : mr_duration ] displays these three quantities for the clusters detected at the epoch d. the absence of relation between the mass and the epoch of formation reveals that massive objects are formed throughout the interaction process .",
    "it however exists an age - half mass radius relation : the most extended object formed earlier .",
    "this could indicate either an evolution pattern , namely the expansion of the clusters , or general properties of the cluster they maintain since their birth .",
    "[ fig : mr_evol ] reveal that in the early stages of the merger , young clusters can be detected with a relatively large radius ( @xmath78 ) before any internally - driven evolution takes place .",
    "therefore , the extended nature of the clusters formed early is a signature of the conditions of their formation .",
    "the interaction and the associated compression by tides and turbulence @xcite tend to form dense but small gas clumps .",

    "( the details of this timing vary depending on the exact position of the clusters in the galaxies when they collide : clusters in the outermost regions of the galaxies form their second stellar population before the galactic pericenter passage itself . ) therefore , the interaction acts as a global trigger to form star clusters , but also their secondary stellar populations .",
    "we also note that the most massive clusters gain a fraction of their mass by accreting smaller objects . since these smaller objects also preferentially formed during the global starburst , the resulting stellar population in the final cluster yields a small spread in age , shorter than the duration of the starburst , but not two distinct populations .",
    "an analysis of the chemical abundances of such objects ( impossible in our simulation ) may unveil the complexity of their star formation histories .",
    "as mentioned before , computing the gravitational potential on a grid ( particle - mesh method ) and softening the gravitational potential implies that the collisional aspect of the star clusters and thus , the full dynamical evolution can not be probed accurately .",
    "simulations accounting for this do exist but the price for accuracy is a strong limitation in the number of bodies ( i.e. stars ) included . simulating the @xmath85-body driven evolution of several @xmath86 collisional objects remains therefore out of reach .",

    "third , none of the mw clusters is found in massive and extended regime ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) whereas an handful of cases exists in the antennae , clearly separated from the bulk of the distributions .",

    ", a third cloud appears along a spiral arm of the second one .",
    "the three clumps interact with each other , keep accreting and form sub - clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tail_velocity].d ) , following the idea of @xcite and similar to the formation scenario of w3 by ( * ? ? ? * see section  [ sec : w3 ] ) although the object formed here is 300 times more compact that w3 .",
    "@xmath163 after the creation of the tidal tail at the galactic pericenter passage , the three gas clumps host star formation , with no sign of any recent external trigger , contrarily to the clouds in the central regions of the galaxies . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "the stellar objects have merged into a single cluster while the gas clouds are still separated , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdg_cluster ] .",
    "the full star formation episode produces @xmath145 over @xmath164 , with a peak at @xmath165 .    ) of the gas , and the position of the young stars formed in the northern tidal tail , before the clusters merge ( left ) , and after ( right ) .",
    "the giant molecular association host about ten dense sub - clouds , while only one cluster can be detected . ]",
    "this stellar object appears to be much more compact than observed cases of tdgs @xcite .",
    "it has , in fact , the characteristics of a globular cluster ( despite its strong rotation ) .",
    "we note that , at @xmath166 , i.e. when the separation between the galaxies is maximum , this cluster started to fall back toward the galactic centers .",
    "its high orbital energy ( about twice larger than the other clusters in the simulation ) suggests that , despite the energy loss it will experience when entering regions of high density close to the galactic center , it could maintain a large apocentric distance .",
    "the strong tidal field it would eventually experience when going close to the galactic center would significantly accelerate its mass - loss @xcite , and would slow down its rotation ( by tidally stripping stars with high angular momentum , see @xcite and references therein ) , making its properties more in line with the bulk of observed globular clusters .",
    "however , our simulation does not allow us to follow it for a sufficient time , nor to properly account for mass - loss effects to determine the precise fate of this object .",
    "note that only one star cluster is formed in our tidal tails , contrarily to the observations of several tens of clusters in tails of the mice or the tadpole galaxies by @xcite , and of `` beads on a string '' seen by @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that tails could only host the formation of many small structures along them , or a massive tdg - like object , but not both .",
    "the presence in our simulated tails of a star cluster as massive as a tdg and the absence of any other cluster supports this conclusion .",
    "it is difficult to foresee to what extend the scenario presented here is specific to our simulation , or could be extended to other setups , but this object demonstrates that globular clusters can be formed in mergers , even at large distances from the galactic center .",
    "other globular clusters with comparable properties ( size , mass ) are also found in the central @xmath7 , indicating that the formation of a massive , dense stellar object in merger is not limited to the environment of tidal tails .",
    "we analyse the properties of star clusters in a hydrodynamical simulation of the antennae galaxy merger at parsec - resolution , including star formation and stellar feedback ( photoionisation , radiative pressure and supernovae ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the star formation rate becomes independent of the numerical resolution of the simulation at the scale of a few parsecs .",
    "our main findings are as follows .",
    "* although each galactic encounter triggers a burst of star formation , the physics of the bursts strongly varies along the merger .",
    "in particular , the last collision enhances star formation mostly in the galactic center while earlier passages generate starburst over extended volumes . *",
    "more stars are formed during the ( @xmath82-long ) separation of the galaxy progenitors , i.e. in between the encounters , than in each ( @xmath6-long ) starburst episode of the merger sequence . *",
    "the different physical condition of each collision strongly impacts the formation of star clusters : most of the clusters are formed in the first galactic passages while the final coalescence does not trigger the formation of additional stellar systems at the parsec resolution . *",
    "the galactic interaction modifies the nature of the tidal field and the turbulence of the interstellar medium which translates into a starburst activity and the formation of clusters and dense stellar systems 30 times more massive than in isolated galaxies . *",
    "the typical star formation episode of star clusters lasts about @xmath81 .",
    "some objects contain stars with a wider age spread , either because of the accretion of smaller clusters , or because of a secondary burst of star formation triggered by the kpc - scale dynamics of the merger .",
    "* a few objects formed have the properties of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( several @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) .",
    "they share the formation mechanism of massive clusters .",
    "their large half - mass radius originate either from their formation via a merger of gas clouds , or a violent expansion after flying through the galactic center .",
    "the hierarchical formation in sub - clouds being part of a giant complex , as proposed by @xcite is not a unique way to form such objects .",
    "* one tidal tail shows the formation of a young massive cluster , too compact to be considered as a tidal dwarf galaxy .",
    "its _ in situ _ formation is favored by the kpc - scale dynamics of the system at a specific position along the tails .",
    "compressive tides and the absence of shearing motions allow for the formation of a dense gaseous seed , its further accretion of surrounding material and finally star formation .",
    "this object is likely the progenitor of a globular cluster .    despite the convergence of the star formation rate reached by our simulation",
    ", several important physical aspects are still missing .",
    "in particular , the collisional treatment of the gravitational force which rules the evolution of dense stellar systems through two - body relaxation is yet too numerically costly to be included at galactic scales .",
    "thus , resolving the inner structure and internal dynamics of star clusters remains out - of - reach in present - day galaxy simulations .",
    "pioneer steps have been taken to bridge this gap , e.g. by including time - dependent galactic tidal fields in @xmath85-body simulations of star clusters @xcite , but a full coupling of the two scale is yet out - of - reach .",
    "the simulation presented here shows the way for a more realistic description of the initial conditions of the long - term evolution of star clusters .",
    "as mentioned above , our simulation suggests that galaxy mergers could play a role in the formation of secondary populations of star in massive clusters .",
    "this topic deserves to be further explored .",
    "a more detailed description of stellar evolution and stellar feedback , together with a resolution of the sub - parsec structure of star clusters could provide interesting constraints on the effects of self - enrichment and the possible formation of multiple stellar populations .",
