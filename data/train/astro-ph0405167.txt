    "the intrinsic composition of the ism is uncertain because of the mass tied up in dust grains ( @xmath31% ) , and abundance variations between cold and warm clouds which persist after correction for ionization @xcite .",

    "warm low density clouds fill @xmath350% of the galactic disk plane , and hence are the most likely types of clouds to be encountered by the sun .",

    "observations of the 21 cm line indicate that @xmath360% of the h@xmath2  is warm ( 50013000 k ) , and @xmath350% of the warm material is thermally unstable @xcite .",

    "when low frequency ( 0.110 mhz ) radio data are combined with the h@xmath19 and pulsar dispersion measurements , a consistent picture emerges indicating the warm ionized gas consists of clumped low density material , @xmath207000 k , @xmath5@xmath11(e@xmath13)@xmath240.23 @xmath7 , and @xmath32 pc radius @xcite .",

    "this orientation is consistent with voyager 3 khz radio emission data which show a preferred direction parallel to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "possibly the 3khz emission is related to the draping of the magnetic field around the heliosheath since the classical charged interstellar dust grains polarizing the starlight ( radii @xmath30.10.2 @xmath26 m ) are deflected around the heliosheath @xcite .",
    "polarization strengths vary little in the first 10 parsecs , indicating the polarization occurs within 10 pc of the sun @xcite .",

    "the kinematics and abundance patterns of the clic  tell us a lot about its origin , in the first case because cloud motions are traced , and in the second because gas - phase abundances are enriched by grain processing in interstellar shocks @xcite .",
    "diffuse clouds are identified from the velocity structure of the absorption lines , assuming doppler broadening from thermal motions plus a catch - all factor interpreted as turbulence .",
    "good data are important for identifying velocity structure since component crowding in velocity space increases exponentially with improvements in instrumental resolution @xcite . observations of uv and optical lines indicate clic  temperatures are mainly in the range 5000 k to @xmath530000 k , with typical turbulent broadening of @xmath35=1.52.5 km s@xmath9 .",
