    "<S> _  in this paper we have analyzed the impact of kerr nonlinearity on the plasmonic response of graphene nanostructures , specifically for nanoribbons . </S>",
    "<S> the key distinction of nanostructures compared to the corresponding extended system arises from the strongly inhomogeneous fields of localized plasmonic excitations , which in turn incur an inhomogeneous conductive profile . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived a simple analytic expression , eq .  , which approximates the nonlinear resonance shifts , while accounting for both inhomogeneity and overall amplitude of the nonlinear perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic field of the kerr nonlinearity in graphene is the saturation field @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> however , significant nonlinear interaction can be achieved near plasmonic resonances even for much weaker incident fields owing to plasmonic field enhancement . finally , we discussed the existence of a plasmonic bistability in nanoribbons under normal incidence .    </S>",
    "<S> the applications of optical bistabilities are well - known and long - pursued  @xcite , with implications particularly in optical switching . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a range of platforms have been scrutinized for this purpose , in recent years e.g.  in photonic crystal cavities ( pcc ) where nonlinearities are enhanced by large @xmath101-factors and light - slowdown  @xcite . whether graphene can further the state - of - the - art in this mature field remains to be seen  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect , however , that a very profitable avenue for progress exists in hybrid approaches , utilizing e.g.  pcc and graphene in unison  as has in fact been explored experimentally  @xcite , albeit without taking advantage of the resonant plasmonic nonlinearity described herein . a simultaneous tuning of both cavity _ and </S>",
    "<S> _ plasmonic resonance should allow for maximal nonlinear manifestation in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> advances in this direction requires improved understanding of nonlinearities in nanostructures ; the present work constitutes one such effort . </S>",
    "<S> several features , however , remain unexplored , underscoring the fertility and richness of the field . </S>",
    "<S> for example , from a semiclassical perspective , barring atomistic approaches  @xcite , questions remain relating to the role of interband nonlinearities  @xcite , nonlocality , and the effective role of edge states .    in closing </S>",
    "<S> , we mention a final question of singular practical relevance , namely damage thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> so far , to the best of our knowledge , measurements do not exist in the infrared , but in the optical domain  @xcite the reported thresholds fall in the rather broad range from @xmath102 in fs - pulsed operation  @xcite to just @xmath103 for hour - long continuous wave operation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the saturation field at @xmath104 is @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> though direct comparison is impossible , in part due to frequency range , pulse conditions , and the uncertain impact of field enhancement , this highlights that even resonantly enhanced nonlinearities in graphene walk a narrow road  not unlike previous contenders for large nonlinearities . </S>",
