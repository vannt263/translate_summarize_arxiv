    "the motivation of this paper is to study a convergence of continuous stochastic processes on varying compact metric spaces .",
    "if state spaces are fixed , we have the weak convergence as a standard notion of convergences of stochastic processes . when state spaces are not fixed , but embedded into one common space , it is possible to consider the weak convergence .",
    "there have been many studies in such embedded situations : for example , approximations of diffusion processes on @xmath6 by discrete markov chains on @xmath7 in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; approximations of jump processes on proper metric spaces by markov chains on discrete graphs in @xcite and @xcite , and on ultra - metric spaces in @xcite ; diffusion processes on thin tubes shrinking to graphs in @xmath6 in @xcite and references therein ; many studies about scaling limits of random processes on random environments ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper , we consider a convergence of continuous stochastic processes on compact metric spaces converging _ in the lipschitz distance .",
    "_ in this setting , state spaces are not necessarily embedded initially into one common space . by the aid of the lipschitz convergence ,",
    "however , we can choose a family of bi - lipschitz embeddings , which enables us to embed varying state spaces into one common space .",
    "after embedding , we can consider the weak convergence of stochastic processes on such the common space .",
    "with such ideas , we will first introduce a new distance on the set of pairs of compact metric spaces and continuous stochastic processes , and show the completeness of this distance .",
    "we will second study several topological properties induced by this new distance .    to be more precise ,",
    "the main object of this paper is a pair @xmath8 where @xmath3 is a compact metric space and @xmath4 is the law of a continuous stochastic process on @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the set of all pairs @xmath8 modulo by an isomorphism relation ( defined in section [ sec : lp ] ) .",

    "the lipschitz distance is a distance on the set of isometry classes of metric spaces , which was first introduced by gromov ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    ( a ) : :    @xmath5 is a complete metric space    ( theorem [ thm : lpd ] and theorem [ thm : polish ] ) ; ( b ) : :    relative compactness in @xmath5 follows    from bounds for sectional curvatures , diameters and volumes of    riemannian manifolds and uniform heat kernel estimates of markov    processes ( theorem [ thm : rrc ] ) ; ( c ) : :    sequences in a relatively compact set are convergent if the    corresponding dirichlet forms of markov processes are mosco - convergent    in the sense of kuwae  shioya @xcite ( theorem [ thm : scf ] ) ; ( d ) : :    examples for    +    * brownian motions on riemannian manifolds ( section [ subsec : bm ] ) ;    * uniformly elliptic diffusions on riemannian manifolds ( section    [ subsec : ue ] ) .",

    "we define @xmath0 as @xmath21    the inequalities indicate how to measure the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath22 , which live on different path spaces @xmath9 and @xmath23 : first we push - forward @xmath4 by @xmath24 , and then @xmath25 and @xmath22 live on the same path space @xmath23 .",

    "we restrict our interest to paris of riemannian manifolds and markov processes .",

    ", the author dealt with a convergence of stochastic processes on varying state spaces adopting rather a different approach from ours .",
    "he considered a convergence of brownian motions on riemannian manifolds under the gromov ",
