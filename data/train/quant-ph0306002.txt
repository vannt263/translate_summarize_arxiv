    "quantum dynamics induces unitary transformations in hilbert space , but most often it is only the dynamics projected onto a hilbert _ subspace _ that is of interest . in general",
    "this reduced dynamics is nonunitary and therefore displays decoherence @xcite .",
    "for example , if a system of interest is coupled to a bath , then averaging over the bath degrees of freedom introduces decoherence in the system dynamics .",
    "likewise , in an isolated system , the reduced dynamics of a subsystem of this isolated system can display decoherence .",
    "we have termed decoherence in the latter case `` _ intrinsic decoherence _ '' since it does not involve an external bath @xcite .",
    "understanding decoherence is of crucial importance to a variety of modern fields such as quantum information processing @xcite and quantum control of atomic and molecular processes @xcite .",
    "our interest here is in the quantum - classical correspondence ( qcc ) between classical and quantum descriptions of the _ dynamics _ of decoherence . specifically , we consider an initial quantum state subjected to either quantum or classical dynamics and compare the time evolution of the decoherence in both cases .",
    "we note that the formal theory of correspondence between quantum dynamics and classical liouville dynamics @xcite suggests that classical liouville dynamics projected onto a subspace should also display decoherence .",
    "that is , as in the quantum case , the classical liouville dynamics considered in the entire phase space is unitary and the classical liouville dynamics projected onto a subspace is nonunitary .",
    "we therefore expect that the reduced classical liouville dynamics propagated classically will show decoherence dynamics that is , at least qualitatively , parallel to that seen in the reduced quantum dynamics insofar as the loss of phase information , entropy production , etc . in the case of bath - induced decoherence",
    "we recently showed analytically that ( a ) one can indeed introduce a direct classical analog of quantum decoherence , and ( b ) examining the dynamics of decoherence classically gives new insights into both the dynamics of decoherence described quantum mechanically and into the conditions for qcc in decoherence dynamics @xcite .",
    "here we extend these considerations to intrinsic decoherence , both analytically and computationally . specifically , in this paper we study qcc in the dynamics of intrinsic decoherence in smooth hamiltonian systems , with an emphasis on the usefulness of classical dynamics in describing intrinsic decoherence .",
    "in particular , the classicality of early - time intrinsic decoherence dynamics is studied using a second - order perturbative treatment , and the interesting connection between decoherence rates at later times and the stability properties of classical trajectories is revealed by considering a simple approximate classical theory of intrinsic decoherence dynamics .",
    "the analytic and computational results shed new light on decoherence , dynamics of quantum entanglement , and quantum chaos .",

    "( [ seq4 ] ) ] .",
    "second , both @xmath29 and @xmath25 are seen , in the chaotic case , to relax faster towards @xmath123 than they do in the integrable case .",
    "third , the oscillation amplitudes of @xmath25 in the chaotic case are much smaller than that in the integrable case . hence , the fast relaxation and small - amplitude oscillations of @xmath25 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - chaotic ] may be regarded as fingerprints of the underlying classical chaos . finally , and most importantly , the entire time dependence , including oscillations in fig .",
    "[ fig - inte ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - chaotic ] of @xmath25 are beautifully captured by both the exact and the approximate @xmath29 .",
    "it should also be noted that the qcc time scale shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - chaotic ] is appreciably longer than is the qcc break time @xmath124 for the same @xmath23 , obtained by quantitatively comparing the structure of the classical and quantum distribution functions @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that @xmath29 [ or @xmath25 ] describes the reduced distribution functions @xmath126 [ or @xmath127 which is insensitive to the fine structure of @xmath16 [ or @xmath17 ] .",
    "calculations for many other initial states confirm that the qcc results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - inte ] and [ fig - chaotic ] are typical , indicating that ( a ) qcc is essentially exact over large time scales and ( b ) the simple classical theory of intrinsic decoherence dynamics introduced above provides a useful approximation to the exact results .",
    "figure [ fig - chan ] shows one case , however , where the approximate @xmath29 and exact classical or quantum results differ quantitatively . here",
    "the system is still the quartic oscillator model with @xmath76 , @xmath74 , but with an initial state of special type .",
    "in particular , both the initial average position @xmath129 and the initial average momentum @xmath130 are set to zero .",
    "initial states of this type are called channel states @xcite , and effectively give rise to very weak coupling between the two subsystems over a considerably large time scale . indeed , since at short times @xmath131 for @xmath132 , one obtains from eqs .",
    "( [ cfg ] ) and ( [ qfg ] ) that @xmath133 .",
    "therefore the early - time intrinsic decoherence rate should be small , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - chan ] , although the underlying classical dynamics is strongly chaotic .",
    "for this reason one expects that the dynamical behavior of @xmath29 and @xmath25 should differ from previous cases . as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig - inte ] and [ fig - chaotic ] .",
    "agreement between them remains excellent .",
    "however , the approximate @xmath29 misses some of the important structure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - nonlinear ] we show the qcc result for a simple variant of the quartic oscillator model , i.e. , @xmath134 , a coupling potential that is neither linear nor quadratic . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - nonlinear ] , even with such nonlinear coupling @xmath29 and @xmath25 are in excellent agreement over large time scales .",
    "this emphasizes the fact that the good qcc results observed in the quartic oscillator model are not due to the fact that the coupling potential therein is quadratic .",
    "hence , we conclude that for initially localized states , our simple classical theory of intrinsic decoherence dynamics [ see eq .",
    "( [ seq4 ] ) ] is generally useful in describing intrinsic decoherence dynamics in smooth hamiltonian systems .",
    "quantum entanglement between individual subsystems has no classical analog . nevertheless ,",
    "as shown in this work , the quantum dynamics of quantum entanglement , as manifest in the quantum dynamics of intrinsic decoherence , does have a classical analog in classical liouville dynamics describing classical correlations between classical subensembles .",
    "hence it is useful to isolate the conditions under which there is good qcc in intrinsic decoherence dynamics .",
    "this is done analytically , for early - time dynamics and for weak decoherence , by a second - order perturbative theory .",
    "interestingly , as demonstrated by our computational studies in sec .",
    "[ sample ] and sec .",
    "[ classical - theory ] , the physical picture of qcc afforded by the perturbative treatment can be still very useful even when the time scale under investigation is relatively long and the degree of intrinsic decoherence is significant . in particular , under the circumstances where there is good early - time qcc , classical liouville dynamics can provide a simple means of understanding different aspects of intrinsic decoherence dynamics , for relatively large time scales and for both integrable and chaotic dynamics .",
    "further , we have derived an approximate but very simple classical theory of linear entropy production of intrinsic decoherence dynamics associated with localized initial states , and shown that the rate of entropy production is closely related to the stability properties of classical trajectories .    clearly , the linear entropy is just one of many possible representation - independent measures of intrinsic decoherence , and @xmath135 does not mean that the quantum dynamics is equivalent to the corresponding classical liouville dynamics .",
    "for example , if the saturation value of the linear entropy in the long time limit is of particular interest , then the measures @xmath136 $ ] and @xmath137 $ ] ( which gives the number of orthogonal states that are incoherently populated ) should be more useful in describing qcc .",
    "indeed , our results in figs .",
    "[ fig - chaotic ] and [ fig - nonlinear ] suggest that as time increases one has @xmath136>>1/[1-s_{{\\rm q}}(t)]$ ] .",
    "this is consistent with our previous observation @xcite that , decoherence can dramatically improve qcc , but even strong decoherence does not necessarily suffice to ensure that quantum entropy production is the same as classical entropy production .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the model quantum systems studied in this paper are still far from the semiclassical regime .",
    "this is indicated , in the chaotic case of the quartic oscillator model for example , by the fact that the qcc break time is relatively short compared to the time scale that we examined .",
    "correspondence will worsen quantitatively with increasing @xmath23 , although , as discussed above , @xmath23 is far from the only factor influencing the quality of the qcc .",
    "however , we note that for localized initial states the qualitative features of the time dependence of classical and quantum linear entropy may remain similar to one another with much larger effective planck constants .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ bighbar ] displays fairly good qcc between @xmath25 and @xmath29 , in the chaotic case of the quartic oscillator model , with @xmath138 and with an initial symmetric gaussian state .",
    "a number of interesting extensions of this work are under consideration .",
    "first , it seems straightforward but necessary to consider cases in which the coupling potential depends upon both position and momentum .",
    "second , we propose to further investigate the role of the dynamics of the subsystems in addition to that of the coupling potential ( e.g. , the dynamics in coupled morse oscillator systems ) .",
    "third , it is interesting to study qcc in intrinsic decoherence dynamics in terms of the decay of off - diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "such studies are ongoing , with preliminary studies @xcite indicating that comparing the time dependence of off - diagonal density matrix elements to its direct classical analog @xcite will provide deeper insights into qcc in intrinsic decoherence dynamics .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that classical dynamics can be very useful in describing intrinsic decoherence dynamics in smooth hamiltonian systems .",

    "<S> a direct classical analog of the quantum dynamics of intrinsic decoherence in hamiltonian systems , characterized by the time dependence of the linear entropy of the reduced density operator , is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the similarities and differences between the classical and quantum decoherence dynamics of an initial quantum state are exposed using both analytical and computational results . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the classicality of early - time intrinsic decoherence dynamics is explored analytically using a second - order perturbative treatment , and an interesting connection between decoherence rates and the stability nature of classical trajectories is revealed in a simple approximate classical theory of intrinsic decoherence dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the results offer new insights into decoherence , dynamics of quantum entanglement , and quantum chaos . </S>"
