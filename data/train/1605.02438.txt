    "sn type iin ( e.g. filippenko 1997 ) which are characterised by the presence of h , show a wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties , while hydrogen deficient sn type i split into type ia which show blended iron - group element emission lines , and type ib and type ic which are characterised by several lines of intermediate elements .",
    "sn explosions lead to collisions of the ejecta with the host galaxy medium .",
    "a shock propagates in reverse through the circumstellar matter ( csm ) , while the shock accompanying the ejecta propagates outwards through the host galaxy clouds ( chevalier 1982 ) .",
    "observational and theoretical evidences indicate that long duration @xmath0-ray bursts ( lgrb ) originate from the death of very massive stars ( e.g. paczynski 1998 ) , they are flashes of cosmic high energy ( @xmath61 @xmath7 gev ) photons ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) and explode in star forming galaxies .",
    "lgrb and their afterglows are associated with broad lined sn ic ( e.g. hjorth et al 2003 , stanek et al 2003 ) .",
    "they provide information about star - forming galaxies at high z ( e.g. krhler et al 2015 , blanchard et al 2015 and references therein ) . lgrb host galaxies are moderately star forming ( sfr @xmath3 1 - 10  ) , with stellar masses of @xmath3 1 - 5 10@xmath8   and high specific star formation rates ( fruchter et al 2006 , savaglio et al 2009 ) . moreover , they reveal morphology , star forming rates and burst energetics and location relatively to the galaxy centres ( castro - tirado et al 2001 ) .",
    "sollerman et al ( 2005 ) investigating low redshift ( z@xmath1 0.2 ) grb galaxy hosts through spectra which include the hei 5876 line , concluded that they are star - forming galaxies ( l@xmath1 ) with relatively low metallicity .",
    "helium lines are significant for grb as well as for sn type ic relatively to wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , which could be considered as lgrb progenitors , depending on metallicity ( han et al 2010 ) .",
    "short duration grb ( sgrb ) last less than 2s , while lgrb have longer duration ( kouveliotou et al 1993 ) .",
    "short bursts have significantly fainter afterglows . their properties are known from their association with the host galaxies ( fong et al .",
    "2013 ) . however ,",
    "fong et al could not find a trend linking grb duration and host type .",
    "the lack of an associated supernova and their link to a heterogeneous sample of host galaxies ( e.g. kann et al . 2011 ) is consistent with a compact binary merger origin ( rosswog et al .",
    "2003 ) , such as neutron stars or black holes .",
    "de ugarte postigo ( 2012 ) suggested that the merger is not associated with the galaxy star - forming region bulk , but it occurs in dense regions .    in this paper",
    "we refer to the narrow line - emission spectra from sn and grb host galaxies . in sn",
    "hosts the spectra are emitted downstream of shock fronts which decelerate colliding with high density clouds .",
    "the line ratios account for the physical conditions of the gaseous clouds , for the photoionization flux from the starburst ( sb ) throughout the host and for the progenitor composition .",
    "the spectra seen in grb hosts originate in star - forming regions , probing the conditions of the gas .",
    "sn and grb are generally analysed by their light curves , whereas the host galaxy properties are investigated by the continuum spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the different wavelength domains and by the line spectra .",
    "spectroscopic data provide a full physical and chemical picture for local galaxies . at high redshifts",
    "the data are reduced to a few significant lines , but the surveys contain hundreds of objects .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the o / h metallicity , o / h are calculated by the `` direct methods '' ( see e.g. modjaz et al 2008 ) .",
    "the data are also compared with diagnostic diagrams calculated for general cases . on the other hand",
    ", the detailed modelling of the spectra , which is currently used to interpret local galaxy spectra , can not be always adopted for high z objects , if the models are not constrained enough , e.g. by the lack of the auroral line [ oiii]4363 ( see contini 2014a ) , one of the h lines such as , ( is not always observed ) , he lines and others .",
    "this leads in particular to the ambiguous identification of the gas photoionizing and heating sources ( agn , sb and/or shocks ) .    in the following",
    "we revisit the emission spectra from the host galaxies of super - luminous sn ( slsn ) presented by the leloudas et al ( 2015 ) survey , of different sn types by sanders et al ( 2012 ) , of broad lined sn type ic by modjaz et al ( 2008 ) , of the lgrb hosts from the surveys of krhler et al , savaglio et al ( 2009 ) , sollerman et al ( 2005 ) , castro - tirado et al ( 2001 ) , graham & fruchter ( 2013 ) , levesque et al ( 2010 ) , vergani et al ( 2011 ) , piranomonte et al ( 2015 ) , the lgrb line and continuum spectra with wr features from the han et al ( 2010 ) survey and the sgrb line spectra from de ugarte postigo et al ( 2014 ) , cucchiara et al ( 2013 ) and soderberg et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "we have selected the spectra suitable to constrain the models .",
    "the code sumamarcel / suma / index.htm ] which simulates the physical conditions in a gaseous cloud under the coupled effect of photoionization from a primary radiation source and shocks was adopted to calculate the spectra .",
    "the line and continuum emission from the gas are calculated consistently with dust - reprocessed radiation in a plane - parallel geometry .",
    "the input parameters refer to both the shock and the photoionization source .",
    "we obtain the physical characteristics of the different host galaxies reproducing by the calculations the observed line ratios of each object , i.e. the photoionization source intensity flux , its frequency distribution ( agn or sb ) and in the sb case the effective temperature and ionization parameter .",
    "moreover , we obtain the shock velocity , the preshock density , the geometrical thickness of the gaseous clouds and the element abundances throughout the host galaxy .    in the following",
    ", we present new results and compare them with those of previous investigations , in particular about the element abundances at relatively high redshifts , because metallicity is one of the fundamental parameters which affects the evolution of massive stars ( piranomonte et al , sollerman et al , etc ) . in sect .",

    "3 we present the modelling of the galaxy hosts and in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the results regarding the sfr connection with the different physical parameters and element abundances .",
    "concluding remarks follow in sect .",
    "the code calculates the emission line and continuum flux from a cloud of gas ( and dust ) , independently from the number of the observed lines .",
    "the calculated line wavelengths range from far - uv to far - ir .",
    "we do not report in the tables the calculated lines which can not be compared with the data .",
    "we refer only to spectra emitted from the sn and grb host galaxies where the different shock and photoionization events occur .",
    "detailed modelling by the codes e.g. cloudy , mappings , etc .",
    ", that were assembled following the observations of spectra rich in number of lines from different elements and in different ionization stages , is generally disregarded for high z galaxies , because the observed lines are few , while hundreds of galaxies are observed in each survey .",
    "galaxies at high redshifts often originate from mergers and show a disturbed hydrodynamic structure .",
    "collisional phenomena are critical in the calculation of the spectra adopting models based on the coupled effect of photoionization and shocks . we suggest that they are the closest approximation to the complex structure of the emitting gas and they are therefore suitable to sn and grb host galaxies .",
    "different results derive from the different interpretation methods .",
    "anderson et al ( 2016 ) claim that emission line diagnostics are separated in two groups .",
    "empirical methods , using the [ oiii ] 5007/4363 ratio to estimate the emitting gas temperature , calculate the o / h relative abundance directly from the oxygen line ratios to .",
    "the second group compares the observed line ratios with those predicted by photoionization / stellar population synthesis models .",
    "our approach is different .",
    "a comparison between the results obtained by the `` direct methods '' and by the detailed modelling adopting suma was presented by contini ( 2014a ) who suggested that the relative abundances obtained by direct methods are lower limits , because a constant temperature is adopted throughout all the galaxy .",
    "it is well known ( williams 1967 ) that the gas recombines following the cooling rate by free - free , free - bound and line emission in the regions farther from the radiation source and ( cox 1972 ) following the cooling rate downstream of shock fronts .",
    "therefore , regions of low temperature and density in the galaxy should be considered .",
    "the line fluxes are calculated multiplying the fractional abundance of the corresponding ions by the element abundance and integrating throughout the galaxy .",
    "the fractional abundance of certain ions ( e.g. o@xmath9/o ) , considering gas recombination , is lower than the fractional abundance calculated by an homogeneous temperature adapted to the [ oiii]5007/4363 line ratio .",
    "so , to reproduce e.g. [ oiii]/a relatively high o / h is adopted .",
    "moreover , all the line ratios in each observed spectrum are reproduced by the same model .",
    "most of the spectral observations of single high redshift galaxies cover the entire object . interpreting the average spectra by models used to calculate the parameters in the different regions of a single local galaxy ,",
    "we reach approximated or even distorted information .",
    "for instance , the galaxy is filled with star clusters , colliding clouds of dust and gas heated and ionized by the flux from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , from sb , sn , etc .",
    "turbulence leads to fragmented gas clouds .",
    "the sn remnants ( snr ) throughout the ism reveal different physical conditions and element abundances , e.g. the higher than solar ( see table 1 ) he / h @xmath30.4 in the crab nebula filaments ( williams 1967 , contini et al .",
    "1977 ) , the depletion of the heavy elements in the cygnus loop ( contini & shaviv 1980 ) , the different kinds of h , he and n rich flocculi or o and s rich knots ( contini 1987 ) and other filaments ( fesen & milisavljevic 2015 ) in cassiopeia a , the dusty clouds showing higher than solar n / h in the kepler snr ( contini 2004 ) , etc .",
    "the emitting clouds surrounding the explosion site are compressed , heated and ionized by the expanding shock which blends with the ism at large distances .",
    "shifting , for instance , the galaxy complex to a high redshift and analysing the average spectrum observed at earth ( old position ) , the single region characteristic parameters would result smoothed and averaged .",
    "the rich spectra observed from local galaxies allow to assemble a multi - cloud model taking into consideration many different clouds within the galaxy ( e.g. rodriguez - ardila et al 2005 ) . actually , for high z objects , the observed spectra cover the entire galaxy",
    "so , we select for each object the model best fitting the line ratios of a prototype cloud which should prevail throughout the galaxy .      by suma ,",
    "the calculations start at the shock front where the gas is compressed and thermalized adiabatically , reaching the maximum temperature in the immediate post - shock region ( @xmath10 km s@xmath11@xmath12 , where is the shock velocity ) .",
    "t decreases downstream following the cooling rate .",
    "this region is cut into a maximum of 300 plane - parallel slabs with different geometrical widths , which are determined automatically , in order to follow smoothly the temperature gradient .",
    "the input parameters such as the shock velocity , the atomic preshock density 0 , the preshock magnetic field 0 , define the hydrodynamical field .",
    "they are used in the calculation of the rankine - hugoniot equations at the shock front and downstream .",
    "they are combined in the compression equation which is resolved throughout each slab of gas in order to obtain the density profile downstream .",
    "the input parameters that represent the primary radiation field for a sb are the effective temperature and the ionization parameter @xmath5 . for an agn ,",
    "the primary radiation is the power - law radiation flux from the active center @xmath13 in number of photons @xmath14 s@xmath11 ev@xmath11 at the lyman limit and spectral indices @xmath15=-1.5 and @xmath16=-0.7 .",
    "the secondary diffuse radiation emitted from the slabs of gas heated by the shocks is also considered .",
    "primary and secondary radiations are calculated by radiation transfer throughout the slabs downstream . the dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath17 ) and the abundances of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , a , fe , relative to h , are also accounted for .",
    "they affect the calculation of the cooling rate .",
    "the input parameters ( , 0 , , @xmath5 , @xmath18 , relative abundances , etc ) which define a model , are the most significant ones in order to represent the conditions of the gas within a specific object clouds .",
    "hundreds of other parameters are considered in the calculations e.g. the recombination coefficients for each ion of each element , the ionization cross sections etc .",

    "we calculate grids of models which approximately reproduce the observed line ratios .",
    "we start adopting solar abundances as a first trial ( allen 1976 , table 1 ) .",
    "we vary the input parameters until a satisfactory fit to all the observed line ratios is obtained consistently .",
    "each line has a different strength which translates in different precision by the fitting process .",
    "a minimum number of significant lines ( e.g [ oiii ] 5007 + , [ oii]3727 + , [ oiii]4363 , [ nii ] , , ) is necessary to constrain the model but the number of the observed lines does not interfere with the modelling process .",
    "each model calculates more than 200 line ( and continuum ) fluxes from far - uv to far - ir .",
    "we deal with line ratios to avoid distance and morphological effects .",
    "we start referring to line ratios of the same element ( e.g. [ oiii]/[oii ] , heii / hei ) because they depend on the physical conditions of the gas . for all models 0=10@xmath19gauss is adopted .",
    "the models are initially constrained by the observed fwhm of the line profiles ( when available ) which are roughly related with the velocity field and can give a first hint to the shock velocity .",
    "in a single galaxy , different emitting regions can be directly recognized from complex fwhm .",
    "this determines whether a pluri - cloud model should be considered .",
    "then , the grids are completed by comparing calculated with observed line ratios to ( e.g. [ oiii]/ ) , in order to obtain the relative abundances of the different elements . if all the line ratios to h of a single element are higher ( or lower ) than the observed ones , the relative abundance to h of that element is changed .",
    "the abundances of strong coolants ( e.g. he , c , o , ) affect the cooling rate ( by line emission ) of the gas in the recombination zone .",
    "consequently , by increasing or reducing one element abundance , all the calculated line ratios change and even if we have already reached a satisfactory fit for most of the line ratios , the whole modelling process is restarted until all the calculated line ratios are well tuned .",
    "a perfect fit is not realistic because the observed data have errors , both random and systematic .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculation is due to the atomic parameters ( within 10 % ) which are often updated .",
    "the strongest lines ( e.g. [ oiii]5007 ) are reproduced by @xmath1 10% , the weakest ( e.g. [ oiii]4363 ) by @xmath3 50 % .",
    "the calculation code and our modelling method are described by contini ( 2014a , 2015 and references therein ) .",
    "different grids of models are calculated for different galaxy types .",
    "dealing with spectra of high z objects , which contain mainly oxygen lines , a first hint about the model is given by [ oiii]/[oii ] , which does not depend on o / h , and from [ oiii]/and [ oii]/which depend on both the physical conditions and o / h .",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath5 which represents the ratio between the number of photons from the sb in the host and the number of electrons in the cloud of gas reached by the radiation flux , links the photoionization source with the galaxy ism properties .",
    "model degeneracy between and @xmath5 is only apparent .",
    "for instance , a higher increases both the [ oiii]/and [ oiii]/line ratios but a higher @xmath5 not always yields a higher [ oii]/. line ratios to in the optical range , which are strong enough to be observed , are shown as function of @xmath5 ( top diagram ) and ( bottom diagram ) in fig .",

    "recall that n is linked with 0 by compression downstream ( n/0 ) which ranges between @xmath1 10 and @xmath23 100 , depending on and 0 .",
    "a high density , increasing the cooling rate , speeds up the recombination process of the gas , enhancing the low ionization level lines .",
    "each line comes from a region of gas at a different electron density and temperature , depending on the ionization level and the atomic parameters characteristic of the ion .",
    "the density n is roughly revealed by the [ sii]6716/6731 doublet ratio .",
    "the [ sii ] lines are also characterised by a relatively low critical density for collisional deexcitation . in some cases the [ sii]6716/6731 line ratio varies from @xmath231 to @xmath11 throughout a relatively small region downstream .",
    "in fact the [ sii ] line ratios depend on both the electron temperature and density of the emitting gas ( osterbrock 1974 , fig .",
    "5.3 ) which , in models accounting for the shocks , are far from constant throughout the clouds .",
    "so , even sophisticated calculations which reproduce approximately the highly inhomogeneous conditions of the gas , lead to some discrepancies between the calculated and observed line ratios .",
    "so [ sii]/ratios do not reproduce the observations with the required precision .",
    "unfortunately , there are no data for s lines from higher ionization level , which could indicate whether the choice of the model is misleading or different relative abundances should be adopted . recall that sulphur can be easily depleted from the gaseous phase and trapped into dust grains and molecules .",
    "we consider that the [ sii]/line ratios are indicative of the s / h relative abundance .",
    "the same is valid for the [ nii ] lines .",
    "the observations do not contain any other strong line of n , which could confirm whether the gap between the calculated and the observed [ nii]/line ratios can be resolved by changing the n / h relative abundance or the other input physical parameters . notice that [ nii ] lines come from the same region of the gas that emits the [ oii ] lines due to charge exchange reaction between o@xmath24 , n@xmath24 and h@xmath24 .",
    "[ oii]/line ratios depend on the physical parameters and are constrained by [ oiii]/ , so the [ nii]/line ratios can easily show abnormal n / h relative abundances .",
    "nitrogen is less abundant than other elements e.g. oxygen , neon , etc .",
    ", therefore it is not a strong coolant , namely , does not affect strongly the cooling rate of the gas downstream .",
    "changing n / h , the [ nii]/line ratios accordingly change , but the other line ratios are not modified .",
    "o / h relative abundances calculated by detailed modelling are generally higher than those calculated by the `` direct methods '' .",
    "in fact , oxygen is a strong coolant which shapes the temperature , density profiles and the relative distribution of the different ions throughout the host clouds .",
    "the contribution from slabs of gas to a line can be low in regions where the gas conditions are less adapted to a high ion fractional abundance .",
    "a high element abundance compensates the gap between the calculated and observed line intensity . by the `` direct methods '' the regions of gas with temperatures and densities less adapted to a line are not considered and the element abundances are calculated directly considering the most appropriated conditions for the ion .",
    "a higher o / h not always yields higher [ oiii]/ , [ oii]/and [ oi]/by the same factor , sometimes it even leads to opposite trends , depending on the set of all the input parameters .",
    "the [ oiii]4363 line depends on the gas temperature and density , constraining the model .",
    "the final choice of a model is dictated by [ oiii]4363/(when observed , see contini 2016 ) that is calculated consistently with [ oiii]5007+/and [ oii]/. however , this line is generally weak .",
    "its role in modelling the spectra was discussed by contini ( 2014a ) .",
    "we have gathered the spectra emitted from sn and grb host galaxies .",
    "modelling results of selected objects are shown in the following .",
    "leloudas et al ( 2015 ) present the spectra from the host galaxies of super luminous sn ( slsn ) .",
    "they are very bright explosions which mostly occur in faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "the subtypes slsni and slsnr are h poor and they are distinguished by their light curve evolution .",
    "slsnii are h rich .",
    "leloudas et al ( 2015 ) refer to extreme emission line galaxies ( eelg ) observations . for spectroscopy they used fors2 and x shooter on the vlt , osiris on the gtc and imacs on magellan .",
    "narrow lines originate from the host galaxy , downstream of the shock produced by collision of the fast moving ejecta with the csm ( see leloudas et al 2015 and references therein ) .",
    "we report in table 2 the data presented by leloudas et al ( 2015 ) in their table b1 . for each galaxy",
    "the observed line ratios are followed in the two next rows by the best fitting results calculated by shock dominated ( sd ) models ( ml1-ml26 ) and radiation dominated ( rd ) models ( mll1-mll26 ) which account for the photoionization flux from the sb + shocks , respectively . in table 2 , columns 8 - 15 , the model input parameters are reported .",
    "the sd models ( ml1-ml26 ) , which best reproduce the [ oii]/and [ oiii]5007+/line ratios ( the + indicates that the doublet is summed ) show relatively high shock velocities ( except for sn 1999as and sn 1999bd ) .",
    "sd models are presented for all the objects even if a broad component was observed only in the and [ oiii ] line profiles of the ptf11dsf galaxy .",
    "this broad component can be attributed to strong outflows of sn winds ( leloudas et al ) or from sb star outbursts ( contini 2015 ) .",
    "the relatively low velocities of rd models refer to the encounter of the sn outflowing shock with the ism clouds .",
    "the shock velocities and pre - shock densities calculated by rd models are in average similar to those in the proximity of sb clouds ( contini 2015 and references therein ) .",
    "the results of absolute fluxes ( in table 2 , col .",
    "11 ) calculated for sd models show that the intensity of the line fluxes are lower than those calculated by coupled photoionization and shock by factors between 10 and 1000 .",
    "therefore the contribution of high velocity clouds can be hardly distinguished from the underlying noise of the spectra .",
    "sd models overpredict the observed [ oiii ] 4363/ratios by factors @xmath233 .",
    "therefore , rd models are more appropriated .",
    "table 2 results confirm that sn generally occur in sb galaxies and show that some star temperatures are approaching those characteristic of outburst ( see contini 2014b ) .",
    "the temperatures of a few slsni and slsnr host sb are even higher than those found in galaxies with activity at relatively high z. we associate the `` activity '' in galaxies ( van dokkum et al .",

    ". the geometrical thickness of the emitting clouds drops from @xmath18 @xmath21 30 pc for galaxies at z@xmath250.3 to @xmath210.3 pc at lower z. in general the shocks accompanying turbulence in the sb lead to fragmentation of matter and to different cloud thickness within a large range .",
    "sanders et al presented the spectroscopic observations of a relatively large sample of different sn type host galaxies at 0.01@xmath1z@xmath10.15 .",
    "the authors were particularly interested in the relative abundances of significant elements .",
    "the results of their investigation show rather low metallicities .",
    "they were obtained by different methods which are well described in their text . these methods which refer mainly to the oxygen lines can not provide a consistent representation of the physical properties of the emitting gas such as to explain all the line ratios reported by each galaxy spectrum .",

    "the results obtained by modelling broad lined sn type ic hosts by modjaz et al , sn hosts by sanders et al and slsn host galaxies by leloudas et al are presented in this paper and compared with those calculated for various lgrb and a few sgrb host galaxies at z@xmath13.4 .",
    "it was found that :    \\1 ) the differences between the ii , i , and r slsn types are irrelevant in terms of the host and 0 . but and @xmath5 calculated for a few slsni hosts ( @xmath23 10@xmath22k and @xmath250.1 , respectively ) are higher than for the other slsn types .",
    "the latter are similar to and @xmath5 calculated for lgrb hosts ( @xmath3 3 - 7 10@xmath4k and 0.01 - 0.1 , respectively ) .",
    "\\2 ) the shock velocities and pre - shock densities in sn host galaxies are similar to those found in the other galaxies reported in fig . 5 , at the same z , but in lgrb hosts they are lower .",
    "the calculated by shock dominated models for slsn hosts are higher than for radiation dominated models , but still lower than those calculated for the line emitting galaxies at higher z. in the grb host spectra there is no trace of the high velocity winds predicted by sd models in slsn host spectra .",
    "such winds would waive the low density extended clouds in the ism of these hosts .",
    "\\3 ) and @xmath5 calculated for lgrb hosts show that these are rather quiescent galaxies even at z@xmath3 2 .",
    "it was found by contini ( 2014b ) that activity is associated to a high .",
    "\\4 ) in sn host galaxies some sb stars have temperatures approaching those of outburst .",
    "\\5 ) models reproducing the line spectra of a sample of lgrb galaxies hosting wr stars ( han et al 2010 ) at relatively low redshift , show he / h=0.13 in a few objects .",
    "modelling the continuum sed , the contribution of a rather old stellar population ( 3 - 8 10@xmath36 k ) appears in the near - ir - optical domain .",
    "\\6 ) the o / h relative abundances calculated by detailed modelling of sn hosts are scattered between 12+log(o / h ) = 8.85 and 8.0 .",
    "they are close to solar in lgrb hosts , perhaps contaminated by shocked an photoionised gas within the same galaxy .",
    "o / h are generally higher than those calculated by `` direct methods '' , in particular for lgrb .",
    "n / h are lower than solar by factors of 5 - 20 for both sn and grb hosts .",
    "\\7 ) the geometrical thickness of the clouds is nearly constant for grb hosts , @xmath18@xmath3 0.3 pc and shows a small increase at z@xmath3 2 .",
    "a uniform @xmath18 indicates similar turbulent regimes in the ism of the different hosts .",
    "in fact similar shock velocities are found in grb host clouds .",
    "\\8 ) the absolute fluxes calculated at the emitting clouds of slsni hosts at 0.1@xmath1 z@xmath10.3 , are relatively high , proportionally to and @xmath5 .",
    "\\9 ) slsn host galaxies are more compact than other sn hosts .",
    "concluding , our analysis of slsn and grb host galaxy spectra indicates that some parameters adopted to reproduce the sn and lgrb host galaxy line ratios are different .",
    "first , we have found that the velocity field is lower in lgrb host than in sn host galaxies , and it is very similar to that found in sb galaxies .",
    "second , most stars in the sb throughout the sn hosts have reached temperatures similar to those of outburst , indicating that some activity is going on . moreover , our modelling leads to lower than solar metallicities in term of o / h in sn hosts at 0.1@xmath1z@xmath11 .",
    "metallicities in lgrb hosts are close to solar throughout the 0.01@xmath1z@xmath13.4 range .",
    "the present analysis results of sn and grb host galaxy spectra , in the near uv - optical - far ir range , suggest that the sn - host symbiosis is stronger than the grb - host one in terms of activity .",
    "the physical and chemical conditions in the grb host galaxies are similar to those in sb galaxies within a large z range .",
