    "in a recent publication we analyzed extinction spectrum of a collection of homogeneous spherical particles of a unknown size distribution [ 1 ] ( hereafter referred as rs - i ) .",
    "it was shown that an extinction spectrum , in general , has some easily identifiable characteristic regions where the extinction - frequency relationship can be approximated by simple empirical formulae involving first four moments of the particle size distribution .",
    "the analysis clearly exhibited the manner in which essential features of the particle size distribution gets coded into its extinction spectrum ( more generally known as the interstellar extinction curve in the astrophysical situation ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that the moments could indeed be obtained from its extinction spectrum and that with the knowledge of these moments it was possible to reconstruct the size distribution function .",
    "+   + the analysis in rs - i however , assumed that all particles were of same material for which the refractive index did not vary with frequency .",
    "the question arises what happens when a collection of particles has more than one material component with their refractive indices varying with wavelength .",
    "we address ourselves to these questions in this paper .",
    "in other words , the purpose of this work is to examine the possibility of extending the ideas developed in rs - i to a multi - component system where refractive index of the individual components varies with wavelength of incident electromagnetic radiation . +   + one suitable model where these extensions of rs - i can be studied is a modified version of interstellar dust model due to mathis , rumpl and nordsieck ( mrn ) [ 2 ] .",
    "the mrn model assumes that interstellar dust consists of individual grains of homogeneous spheres of silicates and graphites having very definite power - law size distributions . for graphite grains ,",
    "there is a ",
    "@xmath0 \" approximation [ 3 ] .",
    "this modification essentially converts two component mrn model to a three component mrn model .",
    "investigations in this work show that the frequency - size relationship can still be obtained even when the refractive index of the grains is varying with wavelength .",
    "but , because of rapid variation of refractive index with frequency , now one needs to divide the spectrum in suitable intervals and obtain separate relations for each sub - interval .",
    "this paper presents these relationships in ultraviolet and far - ultraviolet frequency domains for silicate and graphite grains individually .",
    "thus , we not only demonstrate , the successful extension of ideas in rs - i to materials whose refractive index varies with wavelength , but in the process we also present relationships which can be used for testing various models of interstellar dust . +   +",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the dust model considered here .",
    "section 3 gives the functional form of extinction in terms of size distribution parameters as well as the frequency for both graphite and silicate grains .",
    "subsequently , numerical results of extinction obtained from these formulae are compared with exact mie theory computations in section 3 .",
    "the possible use of such formulae for individual components to multi - component system has been demonstrated in section 4 .",
    "finally , we conclude by summarizing and discussing the results of this paper in section 5 .",
    "a classic model of interstellar dust was proposed more than 30 years ago by mathis , rumpl and nordsieck ( mrn ) ( 1977 ) . since then , the basic model is being used even today albeit with some modifications .",
    "it has not been fully superseded by later studies .",
    "the mrn model uses two separate populations of bare silicate and graphite grains with a power - law distribution of sizes of the form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the radius of the spherical grain varying within the limits @xmath3 ( minimum radius ) and @xmath4 ( maximum radius ) .",
    "the size range for graphite and silicate grains is : @xmath5 further , the graphite material is supposed to be present in two distinct structural varieties within the specified range of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this plausibility lies in the fact that graphite is highly anisotropic material .",
    "the refractive index of graphite , therefore , depends on the orientation of electric field relative to the structural symmetry .",
    "owing to difficulties in calculations of exact scattering quantities due to anisotropy , workers have taken resort to an approximation known as @xmath6 approximation [ 3 ] . in this approximation graphite grains",
    "are represented as mixture of isotropic spheres , @xmath7 of which have refractive index @xmath8 ( referred as graphite parallel ) and @xmath9 have the refractive index @xmath10 ( referred as graphite perpendicular ) .",
    "this modification effectively makes mrn model a three component model .",
    "exact extinction coefficient , @xmath11 was obtained using the formula , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the extinction efficiency of an individual scatterer of size parameter @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 as the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "the exact extinction efficiency @xmath17 for a spherical homogeneous scatterer can be computed using mie formulas .",
    "the necessary refractive index particulars for various components ( at various wavelengths ) were taken from the tables provided by draine [ 4 ] on his website . the number of particles per unit volume , @xmath18 has been arbitrarily fixed at @xmath19 . in these calculations .",
    "this being a multiplicative constant , its admitted value does not make any effective difference in the functional form of @xmath20 we wish to determine .",
    "+   + in case of size distributions of spherical particles having constant refractive index ( wavelength independent ) it was shown in rs1 that in the @xmath21 graph , in general , we can identify frequency intervals where @xmath20 has distinctly linear or parabolic or asymptotic behaviour having corresponding functional forms of @xmath20 : @xmath22 @xmath23 etc . , where , @xmath24 are coefficients which have arbitrary dependence on refractive index @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the 2nd , 3rd and 4th raw moments of the size distribution @xmath28 .",
    "+   + in the present situation , where @xmath25 varies with @xmath29 , the coefficients @xmath30 will also show variation with @xmath29 and hence the distinctly simple linear and parabolic forms of @xmath20 will not be observed within a meaningful frequency interval . hence , our approach has been to study the @xmath31 graph for each material component separately for various ranges of @xmath2 , which means varying @xmath3 , @xmath4 . in case of the power - law size distribution , @xmath32 , we have relations : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",

    "four formulae were needed to fit extinction . for silicate ,",
    "three formulae were sufficient .",
    "several values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 were considered .",
    "formulae presented here are valid in the size limits : @xmath45 observations of the spectra suggested that the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 can have the simple forms : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 are taken in units of @xmath51 , @xmath29 in units of @xmath52 .",
    "the number of significant terms contributing to extinction in @xmath41 and @xmath53 depend on the material as well as the frequency interval considered .",
    "the forms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 have been constructed by careful analysis of the regional ( frequency sub intervals ) behaviour of the extinction for each of the materials considered . in the process of developing analytic formulae ,",
    "care has been taken to have a good compromise between accuracy and calculational simplicity so that our analysis could be applied expediently for purposeful dust modelling within the power law framework considered here .",

    ", we feel that the results and the analytic formulae presented in this paper have application - worthiness in the sense that accurate estimates of extinction contributions for these material components in the fuv and uv regions can directly be made .",
    "needless to say that a fuller and more complete account of the extinction contributions made by each and every material components in respect of the various dust models are needed for ascertaining their effectiveness in reproducing the average interstellar dust extinction spectrum .",
    "this necessitates further large -scale investigative work - outs and mathematical analyzes of similar nature as provided by us in this work .",
    "+   + however , as is mentioned in section 1 , our prime motivation behind this work has been to analyze the extinction spectrum for a size distribution of spherical particles having variable refractive index ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "earlier , the same problem with constant @xmath25 ( at all wavelengths ) was analyzed to have simple extinction - frequency relationships in different frequency ranges involving the first few lower order moments as well as some coefficients which seemed to be arbitrarily dependent on the refractive index . in case of power - law distribution",
