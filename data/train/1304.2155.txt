    "stars are unique laboratories where all the interactions in nature come into play to determine the different stages in the stellar evolution .",
    "this comprises the energy generation , which is mainly caused by fusion reactions mediated by strong interactions , as well as the nucleosynthesis of elements mediated by nuclear reactions in different stellar scenarios @xcite .",
    "whereas the main sequences of the stellar evolution and the majority of the elements with mass number below @xmath0 are produced by hydrostatic burning mediated by the strong and electromagnetic interactions , weak interactions grow in importance in later stages @xcite , when the density ( @xmath1 ) and temperature ( @xmath2 ) in the core become larger , increasing the fermi energy of the degenerate electron gas and then favoring electron captures .",
    "in fact , it is a well established feature that weak @xmath3-decay and electron - capture ( ec ) processes are very important mechanisms to understand the late stages of the stellar evolution @xcite , playing a critical role to determine both the presupernova stellar structure and the nucleosynthesis of heavier nuclei .",
    "these processes are dominated by gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions and therefore , the gt properties of _ pf_-shell nuclei are of special importance because they are the main constituents of the stellar core in presupernovae formations @xcite leading to core - collapse ( type ii ) or thermonuclear ( type ia ) supernovae .    while the scenarios for type ia supernovae are thought to be binary systems with a white dwarf accreting material from a companion star , type ii supernovae are the final result of the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star that takes place when the nuclear fuel exhausts .",
    "then , the core becomes unstable and when the mass exceeds the chandrasekhar mass , the electron degeneracy pressure is not able to prevent the gravitational collapse . in the initial stages ,",
    "electrons are captured by nuclei in the iron - nickel mass region , thus reducing the electron - to - baryon fraction ( @xmath4 ) of the presupernova star and correspondingly the degeneracy pressure . at the same time , the neutrinos produced at presupernova densities leave the star reducing the energy and cooling the star .",
    "both effects act in the same direction accelerating the collapse .",
    "with increasing neutronization of the core material , the @xmath5 energies increase and @xmath3-decays become more important competing with ecs .",
    "ec processes are therefore essential ingredients to follow the complex dynamics of core - collapse supernovae and reliable estimates of these rates certainly contribute to a better understanding of the explosion mechanism .",
    "an accurate understanding of most astrophysical processes requires necessarily information from nuclear physics , which provides the input to deal with network calculations and astrophysical simulations @xcite . due to the extreme conditions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 that hold in stellar scenarios ,",
    "most of the nuclear properties can not be measured directly .",
    "therefore , the gt strength distributions must be estimated in many cases by model calculations .",
    "obviously , nuclear physics uncertainties will finally affect the reliability of the description of those astrophysical processes .",
    "the first extensive calculations of stellar weak rates as functions of relevant ranges of @xmath1 and @xmath2 were done in ref .",
    "it was assumed that the whole gt strength resides in a single resonance whose energy relative to the daughter ground state is parametrized phenomenologically , taking the total gt strength from the single - particle model .    in the last decades ,",
    "gt@xmath6 strength distributions on nuclei in the mass region @xmath0 have been studied experimentally via @xmath7 , or equivalent higher resolution charge - exchange reactions such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , at forward angles @xcite .",
    "charge - exchange reactions are the most efficient way to extract the gt@xmath6 strength in stable nuclei @xcite . for incident energies above 100 mev ,",
    "the isovector spin - flip component of the effective interaction is dominant and the cross sections is mainly originated from spin - isospin transitions . at",
    "forward angles the momentum transfer is small and the reaction cross section is dominated by the gt operator with @xmath10 .",
    "the cross section , extrapolated to zero momentum transfer , is proportional to the @xmath3-decay strength between the same states .",
    "charge - exchange reactions at small momentum transfer are therefore used to study gt strength distributions when @xmath3-decay is not energetically possible .",
    "the data show that the total gt@xmath6 strength is strongly quenched and fragmented over many final states , as compared to the independent - particle model .",
    "then , improvements in the weak rates have been focused on the description of the nuclear structure aspect of the problem .",
    "different approaches to describe the nuclear structure involved in the stellar weak decay rates can be found in the literature .",
    "they are basically divided into shell model ( sm ) , either sm montecarlo @xcite or large scale sm diagonalizations @xcite and proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite categories . although qrpa calculations can not reach the detailed spectroscopy achieved from present state - of - the - art sm calculations , the global performance of qrpa is quite satisfactory .",
    "moreover , one clear advantage of the qrpa method is that it can be extended to heavier nuclei , which are beyond the present capability of full sm calculations , without increasing the complexity of the calculation .",
    "very recently , a systematic evaluation of the ability to reproduce the measured gt strength distributions of various theoretical models based on sm and qrpa was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where ec rates were derived from those models at relevant @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "while several sets of sm calculations using different effective interactions were compared , namely kb3 g @xcite and gxpf1a @xcite , in the case of qrpa only the formalism developed in @xcite using deformations and masses obtained from the finite range droplet model @xcite was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in what follows we use the term qrpa - mller to refer to these qrpa results obtained from the above mentioned formalism .",
    "given the sensitivity of the weak rates to the nuclear structure through the gt strength distributions , it is worth extending the study in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering alternative calculations within the qrpa formalism .",
    "indeed , the qrpa method with separable gt interactions was first proposed and applied in ref .",
    "@xcite , on a spherical harmonic oscillator basis , and then it was extended to deformed nuclei @xcite using deformed phenomenological single - particle basis .",
    "further refinements to the qrpa formalism were introduced along the years @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the dependence of the ec rates on both @xmath1 and @xmath2 with gt strength distributions calculated within a qrpa approach based on a selfconsistent deformed hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field with skyrme interactions including pairing correlations and residual separable forces in both particle - hole ( @xmath11 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath12 ) channels .",
    "we compare our calculations with the benchmark calculations in ref .",
    "this formalism represents an improvement over the qrpa - mller approach in several aspects .",
    "first , instead of a phenomenological approach ( single - particle models based on nilsson , woods - saxon , or folded yukawa models ) , the deformed mean field is now obtained selfconsistently and there is no need to introduce deformation parameters as input , and secondly , a separable residual gt interaction in the @xmath12 channel is included .",
    "we should also mention the inclusion of an effective quenching factor in our calculations that was not included in qrpa - mller .",
    "the present nuclear model has been tested successfully reproducing very reasonably the experimental information available on both bulk and decay properties of medium - mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ form ]",
    "the weak decay rates are introduced as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and their nuclear structure and phase space components are described .",
    "section [ results ] contains the results obtained for the gt strength distributions and for the ec rates in some selected _ pf_-shell nuclei that correspond to those used in ref .",
    "@xcite . section [ conclusions ] contains the conclusions of this work .",
    "there are several distinctions between terrestrial and stellar decay rates caused by the effect of high @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "one effect of @xmath2 is directly related to the thermal population of excited states in the decaying nucleus , accompanied by the corresponding depopulation of the ground states .",
    "the weak - decay rates of excited states can be significantly different from those of the ground state and a case by case consideration is needed . another effect related to the high @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 comes from the fact that atoms in these scenarios are completely ionized and consequently electrons are no longer bound to the nuclei , but forming a degenerate plasma obeying a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this opens the possibility for continuum ec , in contrast to the orbital ec caused by bound electrons in the atom under terrestrial conditions .",
    "these effects make weak interaction rates in the stellar interior sensitive functions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .      assuming thermal equilibrium , the probability of occupation of the excited states in the parent nucleus follows a boltzmann distribution .",
    "the decay rate of the parent nucleus is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the partition function and @xmath15 is the angular momentum ( excitation energy ) of the parent nucleus state @xmath16 .    in principle",
    ", the sum extends over all populated states in the parent nucleus up to the proton separation energy .",
    "however , because of the range of temperatures considered in this work ( @xmath17 gk ) , only a few low - lying excited states are expected to contribute in the decay of even - even nuclei .",
    "in fact , the lowest excited states in the even - even nuclei considered are collective @xmath18 states located typically above 1 mev from the ground state .",
    "the lowest of these @xmath18 states corresponds to the nucleus @xmath19fe and appears at @xmath20 mev @xcite .",
    "hence , their contributions to the rates can be neglected at these temperatures .    in the case of odd-@xmath21 nuclei",
    "the situation is more involved because excited states of single - particle nature appear at low excitation energies .",
    "this is particularly the case of @xmath22sc , where one finds up to six excited states below 1 mev @xcite .",
    "these states will become populated as @xmath2 raises and may contribute to the weak rates .",
    "a case by case analysis is mandatory and work in this line is in progress .",
    "the decay rate corresponding to the parent state @xmath16 is given by    @xmath23    where the sum extends over all the states in the final nucleus reached in the decay process and @xmath24 s. this expression is decomposed into a phase space factor @xmath25 , which is a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and a nuclear structure part @xmath26 that contains the transition probabilities for allowed fermi and gt transitions ,    @xmath27    in this work we only consider the dominant gt transitions .",
    "fermi transitions have a simple expression assuming isospin symmetry and are only important for @xmath28 decay of neutron - deficient light nuclei with @xmath29 .",
    "the theoretical description of both @xmath26 and @xmath25 are explained in the next subsections .",
    "the nuclei under study in this work correspond to stable _ pf_-shell nuclei .",
    "@xmath28 decays from their ground states are then energetically forbidden . however , as @xmath2 raises , thermal population of excited states in the parent nucleus may induce @xmath30-decays if @xmath31 exceeds the @xmath32 energy .",
    "these decays that are almost independent of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , might compete with ecs in cases where @xmath2 is high enough to populate significantly excited states in the parent nucleus . in our case",
    "the decays would involve excited states beyond 1.5 - 2 mev in the most favored cases , but they are not sufficiently populated even at the higher @xmath2 considered in this work ( @xmath33 mev at @xmath34 with @xmath35k ) contributions to the weak rates from positron decays are therefore neglected in this work .    in the astrophysical scenarios of our study , nuclei are fully ionized and continuum ec from the degenerate electron plasma are possible .",

    "the solution of the hf equation is found by using the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming time reversal and axial symmetry .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells .",
    "the method also includes pairing between like nucleons in bcs approximation with fixed gap parameters for protons and neutrons , which are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences involving the experimental binding energies @xcite .",
    "potential energy curves are analyzed as a function of the quadrupole deformation .",
    "for that purpose , constrained hf calculations are performed with a quadratic constraint @xcite .",
    "the hf energy is minimized under the constraint of keeping fixed the nuclear deformation .",
    "calculations for gt strengths are performed subsequently for the various equilibrium shapes of each nucleus , that is , for the solutions , in general deformed , for which minima are obtained in the energy curves .    to describe gt transitions ,",
    "a spin - isospin residual interaction is added to the skyrme mean field and treated in a deformed proton - neutron qrpa .",
    "taking into account the phenomenological nature of the skyrme interactions , which are not fitted to spin - isospin observables , it is reasonable to complement the skyrme interaction with some extra phenomenological parameters sensitive to those nuclear properties .",
    "this interaction contains a @xmath11 and a @xmath12 part .",
    "the interaction in the @xmath11 channel is mainly responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance and it can be derived consistently from the same skyrme interaction used to generate the mean field , through the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body densities .",
    "the @xmath11 residual interaction is finally expressed in a separable form by averaging the resulting contact force over the nuclear volume @xcite . by taking separable gt forces , the energy eigenvalue problem reduces to find the roots of an algebraic equation .",
    "the @xmath12 part is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath66 coupling channel , which is also introduced as a separable force @xcite .",
    "its strength is usually fitted to reproduce globally the experimental half - lives .",
    "various attempts have been done in the past to fix this strength @xcite , arriving to expressions that depend on the model used to describe the mean field , nilsson model in the above reference . in previous works",
    "@xcite we have studied the sensitivity of the gt strength distributions to the various ingredients contributing to the deformed qrpa calculations , namely to the nucleon - nucleon effective force , to pairing correlations , and to residual interactions .",

    "the gt strength for a transition from an initial state @xmath16 to a final state @xmath70 is given by    @xmath71 is the effective ratio of axial and vector coupling factors that takes into account in an effective manner the observed quenching of the gt strength .    in even - even nuclei ,",

    "in this work we have evaluated continuum electron - capture rates at different density and temperature conditions holding in stellar scenarios .",

    "we find that the present qrpa calculation is able to reproduce the main features of the gt distributions extracted in these nuclei from charge - exchange reactions .",
    "comparison of our results for the ec rates with sm calculations and other qrpa results analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that , in general , the agreement with experiment is best in the case of sm calculations , but the present qrpa calculations with skyrme forces are of similar quality in most cases , clearly improving the agreement with experiment with respect to qrpa - mller .",
    "thus , the results in this work provide additional information on the performance of qrpa - based models and refine the conclusions in ref .",

    "@xcite produce systematically much larger deviations from the data than sm calculations .",
    "this work demonstrates that this is not the case for all qrpa type calculations .",
    "we have studied the sensitivity of the ec rates to both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . at low @xmath1 ( low fermi energies ) and low @xmath2 ( sharp shape of the energy distribution of the electrons ) , the rates are very sensitive to details of the gt strength of the low - lying excitations and therefore to model calculations",
    ". on the other hand , when the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are high enough , the ec rates are sensitive to all the spectrum .",
    "then , the whole description of the gt strength distribution is more important than a detailed description of the low - lying spectrum .",
    "since qrpa reproduces reasonably well the global behavior of the gt strength distributions , it is expected to be a good approach , especially for high @xmath1 and @xmath2 conditions .",
    "@xmath30 decays and ec from thermally populated excited states in the parent nuclei are expected to occur at high @xmath2 .",
    "contributions to the ec rates from the low - lying excited state in @xmath85zn have been evaluated and compared with the contributions from the ground state in the range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 considered in this work .",
    "a systematic study of these contributions will be very important for more extreme stellar conditions , but in this work they can be safely neglected .",
    "moreover , the main purpose of this work is to compare qrpa results with benchmark sm calculations and to ec rates extracted from the measured gt strength distributions in the laboratory that do not contain those type of contributions .",
