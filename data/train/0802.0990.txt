    "a variety of chemically - peculiar ( cp ) stars are found on or near the upper main sequence .",
    "most of these fall into one of two main groups : the magnetic silicon stars , or the non - magnetic mercury - manganese ( hgmn ) stars .",
    "hd 65949 shares characteristics of both of these groups ( cowley et al .",
    "2006 , henceforth , paper i ) .",
    "intermediate - dispersion spectra of hd 65949 obtained by abt & morgan ( 1969 ) already revealed the outstanding strength of ii @xmath13984 , a signature feature of the hgmn stars .",
    "an estimate of the mercury abundance presented in paper i was higher than any other published value . yet",
    "hd 65949 is quite unlike the typical hgmn stars .",
    "the ii spectrum was present , but much weaker than expected for an hgmn star with its surface temperature , near 13,000k .",
    "hubrig , et al .",
    "( 2006 ) had measured a magnetic field , of the order of few hundred gauss .",
    "this field is weaker than typical for a silicon star .",
    "moreover , two characteristic features of silicon stars were missing ; the spectrum of ii was not particularly strong , and the second spectra of the lanthanides were only weakly present .",
    "hd 65949 may be grouped with two other `` misfits '' near its temperature and surface gravity range : hr 6870 ( hd 168733 , cf .",
    "muthsam & cowley 1984 ) , and hr 6000 ( hd 144667 , castelli & hubrig , 2007 ) .",
    "all three spectra are distinct , as can be seen from figs . 1 and 3 of paper i.    in paper i ,",
    "several uncommon atomic spectra were found to be definitely or possibly present in the spectrum of hd 65949 .",
    "we review these in the sections that follow , along with work done subsequently on the model atmosphere and spectrum of the star .",
    "we do not claim any `` first '' identifications , but draw attention to several atomic spectra found in hd 65949 that are rarely found in stellar spectra .",
    "this paper is based primarily on one of four spectra taken with the eso / feros echelle spectrograph in october 2005 .",
    "the usable wavelength coverage is from 3530 to 9220   , but the spectra are not of good quality to the violet of ca .",
    "the resolving power is about 48000 , and the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio reaches up to 250 .",
    "wavelength and equivalent width measurements were made on the spectrum after it was mildly fourier - filtered .",
    "hd 65949 is a mid - range , main - sequence b - type star . for such objects , the balmer line profiles are far more sensitive to the surface gravity ( @xmath2 ) than the effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the effective temperature , obtained from ubv and strmgren photometry , spans a range from 12200 to 13600k , depending on the system and calibration .",
    "details may be found at ` http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/~cowley/hd65949 ` .",
    "we find good to excellent fits of h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , and h@xmath6 , within this temperature range for @xmath7 .    in paper i , we used a @xmath8 of 13600k , at the high end of the photometric values .",
    "we now find that a lower temperature gives abundance equality among i , ii , iii , and adopt that value , @xmath9k , along with with @xmath7 . in doing this",
    ", we assume the iron abundance is constant throughout the atmosphere .",
    "much new work indicates this assumption may not be true , but for the present , it is a useful , working assumption .",
    "we now obtain the following values for @xmath10 , the logarithmic ratio of the iron abundance to the sum of all abundances : i , @xmath113.95 ( 21 ) ; ii , @xmath114.12 ( 101 ) ; iii , @xmath113.97 ( 7 ) .",
    "the values in parenthesis indicate the number of equivalent widths used for each determination .",
    "oscillator strengths for i , ii were taken from fuhr & wiese ( 2006 ) ; the vald values ( kupka , et al .",
    "2000 ) were used for iii .",
    "our model atmosphere has a helium abundance of 0.5 solar and an iron abundance of @xmath12 , with the remaining abundances being similar to their solar - system values .",
    "abundance determinations were not systematically carried out for all identified spectra .",
    "we mention here two elements whose abundances can be significant for the structure of the atmosphere .",
    "we made a rough estimate of the helium abundance from seven i lines , by a line - fitting techniques using voigt profiles .",
    "we find log(n@xmath13/n@xmath14 ) = @xmath111.40 ; helium is about half of its abundance in the sun .",
    "iron is about a factor of 3 above its solar abundance .",
    "we estimated the oxygen abundance from 10 i lines , excluding the strong triplet , 7772 , 7774 , and 7775   , which is sensitive to nlte .",
    "log(n@xmath15/n@xmath14 ) = @xmath113.32 , which is very nearly solar ( log(n@xmath15/n@xmath14)@xmath16 = 3.38 ) .",
    "figure 2 of paper i shows a feature in the red wing of the ii @xmath13984 line that was difficult to identify .",
    "it turned out to be one of the weaker lines of ii classified by meggers , cataln , & sales ( 1958 ) .",
