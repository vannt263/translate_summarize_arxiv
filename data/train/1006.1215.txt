    "in recent years , an active interest is taken in the electronic properties of heterostructures and surfaces of strongly correlated materials .",
    "@xcite looking for new effects and their possible applications a wide variety of systems has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "theoretical studies of charge excitations near the crystal boundary have been carried out mainly in the framework of the two- ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) hubbard model .",
    "for this purpose different approximate methods have been used , including the slave boson method , @xcite the perturbation theory @xcite and the dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "@xcite in these works , the case of half - filling was considered , when strong electron correlations cause the antiferromagnetic ordering of the crystal .",
    "@xcite however , approximations used in the mentioned works did not take into account the ordering and the interaction of electrons with respective magnetic excitations .",
    "one of the results obtained in refs .   for uniform model parameters",
    "is that on the surface layer the quasiparticle weight is smaller than the bulk value .",
    "the reason is a reduced surface coordination number which implies a lower kinetic energy and consequently effectively stronger correlation effects at the surface .",
    "it is known @xcite that in the case of strong electron correlations the interaction with magnetic excitations plays an important role in the formation of the low - frequency dispersion of charge carriers .",
    "therefore , peculiarities of these excitations in the near - boundary region may have a significant impact upon the properties of electrons here .",
    "the magnetic excitations are described by the quantum heisenberg model .",
    "@xcite the influence of boundaries on its spectrum and observables has been studied in two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions .",
    "in particular it was shown that absolute values of the nearest - neighbor spin correlations near the boundary exceed the bulk value . in refs .",
    "this result was related to the peculiar spectrum of the semi - infinite @xmath3-dimensional antiferromagnet .",
    "the spectrum involves @xmath3-dimensional bulk modes  standing spin waves  and a @xmath4-dimensional mode of boundary spin waves .",
    "these latter excitations eject the bulk excitations from the near - boundary region .",
    "thus the antiferromagnet appears to be divided into two regions with different dominant spin excitations .",
    "charge carriers in the near - boundary region and deep within the crystal appear to be in different spin - excitation environments , that inevitably leads to a dissimilarity in properties of these carriers .",
    "another effect which can contribute to this difference is a smaller number of spin bonds destroyed by charge carriers near the boundary in comparison with the bulk .",
    "as will be seen below , this leads to an attraction of the quasiparticles to the boundary .    to answer the question on how the above - mentioned factors influence the distribution of charge carriers near the boundary we consider the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model , having in mind a cu - o plane of hole - doped cuprate perovskites . to calculate the hole green s function in the case of strong correlation , @xmath2",

    "coordinates from 0 ( the boundary ) deep into the crystal the intensity is redistributed in the function and the main maximum is enhanced and shifted to lower frequencies .",
    "such behavior of the maximum indicates that the near - boundary region is depleted of holes at low hole concentrations .",
    "the appearance of this depletion is connected with the character of hole excitations .",
    "they are spin polarons in which a hole is surrounded by a cloud of magnons . near the boundary",
    ", this cloud is deformed , which leads to an energy loss and to the observed shift of the main maximum to higher energies .",
    "another consequence of the frequency - separated maxima in neighboring rows is a more complicated structure of the boundary spectral function in comparison with its bulk counterpart .",
    "the reason is a replica of a stronger maximum from the second row which is also seen in the boundary spectral function .",
    "our starting point is the hubbard hamiltonian on a square semi - infinite lattice .",
    "we consider an idealized boundary which is located along the @xmath6 crystallographic axis .",

    "it was shown that the near - boundary region of the crystal is depleted of holes .",
    "the reason is the deformation of a magnon cloud around a hole in this region , which is accompanied by energy losses .",
    "the hole depletion is reflected in dissimilar locations and intensities of the main spectral maxima for different site rows near the boundary . as a consequence a replica of a maximum in the second row is seen in the boundary spectral function .",
    "this results in its more complicated shape in comparison with the bulk spectrum .",
