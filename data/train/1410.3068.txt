    "entanglement is a key resource for quantum information processing .",
    "as an open quantum system is susceptible to external environment , entanglement would decay due to losses caused by unwanted interaction between the quantum system and its external electromagnetic field , which may lead to failure of quantum communication between two distant parties ( alice and bob ) and limit transmission distance @xcite .",

    "continuous - variable entanglement has an advantage over discrete - variable one due to its high efficiency in generation and measurement of quantum states @xcite .",
    "as the most widely used continuous variable entangled resource , gaussian epr - like entangled pairs can be generated between amplitude and phase quadratures of two outgoing light beams of a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) @xcite .",

    "the paper also examines effects of losses and time delays on the dual - nopa system .",
