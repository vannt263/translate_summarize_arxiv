    "quantum theory falls into , roughly , two categories  @xcite :    1 .   the description of spectra and structures of micro - physical systems 2 .",
    "scattering and decay phenomena    the distinction between the two categories is primarily one between two ways one looks at the physical objects , rather than a separation of physics into two different areas .",
    "the first is used for stable states and also for slowly decaying states when the finiteness of their lifetime is ignored .",
    "the second is used for rapidly decaying states and resonance phenomena .",
    "the notions of slow and fast are not defined by a time scale in nature but by the capabilities of the experimental apparatuses that we choose or are forced to use in a particular experiment . for instant , the singly excited states of atoms and molecules are mostly treated like stable states whereas the doubly excited states ( auger states ) are mostly treated as resonances or decaying states . however",
    ", when one does the calculations of the energies of the auger states ( e.g. , of he ) one ignores that they decay  @xcite .",
    "the same holds in nuclear physics and in high energy physics .",
    "when one is interested only in the spectra and the structure of relativistic particles , one ignores their lifetimes even though the different states of the same multiplet can have lifetimes that are orders of magnitudes apart .",
    "( e.g. , one can measure the lifetime of @xmath3 but one can not measure the lifetime of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the existence and properties of @xmath4 are determined from lineshape measurements and lifetime was chosen as the inverse of the lineshape width on the basis of some theoretical ideas / approximations for which a theory did not exist @xcite . )    for category i ( spectra and structure ) , one uses a theory of stationary states and time symmetric ( reversible ) evolutions .",
    "the energy values are discrete and the time evolution is unitary and the superpositions are effectively finite .",
    "such systems are well described by conventional quantum mechanics in the hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "infinite superpositions are handled by perturbative methods ( of discrete spectra ) .    the second category ( scattering and decay ) deals with continuous energy spectra and predominantly asymmetric time evolutions .",
    "if one wants to use energy eigenstates , the continuous energy values already require more than what the conventional axioms of quantum mechanics are able to accommodate .",
    "this has been overcome by introducing the dirac kets @xmath6 , which -if they are mathematically defined at all- are defined as functionals on the schwartz space . with this definition ,",
    "energy wave functions @xmath7 do not constitute the entire hilbert space of ( lebesgue ) square - integrable functions , but only the subspace of infinitely differentiable , rapidly decreasing functions , i.e. , schwartz space functions .",
    "the introduction of dirac kets augments the conventional axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics based on the hilbert space and leads to the gelfand triplet @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the schwartz space and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "however , the gelfand triplet based on the schwartz space is not sufficient to obtain a theory that includes scattering and decay .",
    "the reason is that the dynamical ( schrdinger or heisenberg ) equations , when defined as differential equations in the schwartz space of wavefunctions , integrate to a continuous group of evolution operators , much like the unitary group solution of these equations in the hilbert space .",
    "in contrast , resonances and decaying states have been intuitively associated to an asymmetric `` irreversible '' time evolution  @xcite .",
    "thus , they require a time asymmetric theory , and in the absence of such a mathematical theory , their description can only be approximate and must contain contradictions .",
    "if one is guided by the hilbert space mathematics , one always runs into problems with a quantum theory of resonances and decay ; in particular , gamow vectors with exponential decay do not exist in the hilbert space .",
    "therefore , in the heuristic treatment of scattering theory , one just ignored the mathematical subtleties of the hilbert space .",
    "in particular , one worked with mathematically undefined kets @xmath11 , used an infinitesimal imaginary energy part @xmath0 to obtain , respectively , the incoming and outgoing solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equations  @xcite , and distinguished between `` states at time @xmath12 time defined by preparation '' and `` states characteristic of the experiment '' , observed at @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "one restricted by fiat the time @xmath14 in @xmath15 to @xmath16  @xcite , and for decaying states , one postulated purely outgoing boundary conditions  @xcite , undisturbed by the fact that it was in conflict with the unitary group evolution @xmath17 , a direct consequence of the conventional hilbert space axioms of quantum mechanics ( by the stone - von neumann theorem @xcite ) .",
    "these heuristic methods were successful for physical applications , but when one compared them with the mathematical consequences of the hilbert space axiom , one had contradictions .",
    "examples of these are : the exponential catastrophe in which gamow vectors and unitary time evolution were mutually contradictory  @xcite and references therein ; deviations from the exponential decay law  @xcite ; and problems with ( einstein ) causality  @xcite .",
    "it is thus clear that one has to go beyond the mathematical theory which has worked for category i problems .",
    "but many of the empirical notions , like gamow states and lippmann - schwinger kets , have been very successful for the descriptions of scattering and decay , and their successful features need to be preserved when they are incorporated into the new rigorous theory . however , other mathematical consequences of the conventional axioms need to be eliminated .",
    "this means we require a new hypothesis which preserve the successful features and alter the conflicting fallouts from the conventional theory .",
    "new mathematical entities will have to be defined , which we will call again by their old names , like lippmann - schwinger kets or gamow kets , but they will now have new features and are constituents of a consistent theory of resonance scattering and decay .",
    "the new mathematical hypothesis will be conjectured taking the useful features of these heuristic notions as the starting point .",
    "by conventional quantum theory , we hereon mean not only the usual axioms  @xcite in terms of the hilbert space mathematics , but also the dirac formalism mathematically justified by , as stated above in the introduction , a gelfand triplet of the schwartz space . the axiomatic framework of conventional quantum mechanics consists of the following :    * one distinguishes ( physically ) between observables represented by self - adjoint operators ( e.g. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( positive operators ) , or vectors @xmath20 if @xmath21 ) and states represented by trace class operators ( e.g. , @xmath22 or vectors @xmath23 if @xmath24 ) .",
    "+ the quantities compared with experimental data are the born probabilities @xmath25 , or , in the special case @xmath24 and @xmath21 , @xmath26 .",
    "that is , @xmath27 the experimental quantities @xmath28 are the ratios of large integers ( detector counts which necessarily change in time in discrete steps ) . on the other hand",
    ", every mathematical theory is an idealization and thus quantum theory also idealizes to continuous time translations , in consequence of which the calculated born probabilities @xmath29 change continuously in time in a particular way .",
    "the equality between the two quantities @xmath30 and @xmath28 is approximate and the sign @xmath31 expresses this aspect of the statistical character of quantum mechanical predictions and the meaning of the continuity for @xmath32 or @xmath29 as a function of @xmath14 is a mathematical choice .    in conventional quantum mechanics",
    "one makes this choice by identifying    * the set of states @xmath33= the set of observables @xmath34 hilbert space    in dirac s formalism one assumes in addition that    * for every observable , e.g. , @xmath35 , one has a complete set of eigenkets @xmath36 such that * * @xmath37 and * * every vector , state @xmath23 or observable @xmath20 , is a continuous superposition of the eigenkets extending over all `` physical values '' @xmath38 : @xmath39 ( here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are some additional quantum numbers representing the degeneracy of the eigenkets with energy @xmath42 . )",
    "nearly everyone discussing the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite distinguishes between states and observables as asserted by ( a1 ) above . the hilbert space axiom ( a2 )",
    "is already in conflict with this hypothesis ( a1 ) because the content of ( a1 ) is a basic distinction between a state and an observable .",
    "also , the hypothesis ( a3 ) , the dirac formalism , is not possible within the framework of the hilbert space axiom ( a2 ) since neither ( 3a ) nor ( 3b ) is well defined as a vector identity in the hilbert space when @xmath42 is a continuous parameter .",
    "one can overcome this difficulty and make ( a3 ) mathematically tenable by restricting the vectors @xmath33 and @xmath43 to a subspace @xmath9 of the hilbert space and constructing a gelfand triplet , @xmath44 . with this choice of @xmath9",
    ", the eigenkets @xmath36 can be defined as the elements of the dual space @xmath45 and ( 3b ) can be proved as the nuclear spectral theorem . as stated above , if the schwartz space is chosen for @xmath9 so that energy wavefunctions @xmath46 are smooth and rapidly decreasing at infinity , then the dual space @xmath45 , which consists of continuous anti - linear functionals on @xmath9 , is realized by the space of tempered distributions .",
    "therefore , in this representation , the eigenkets @xmath36 find realization as tempered distributions .    in scattering theory , one has in - states @xmath47 and out - observables @xmath48 ( which are usually called out - states ) .",
    "an in - state @xmath49 is prepared at @xmath50 in the asymptotic region as the interaction - free in - states @xmath51 such that @xmath52 similarly , for @xmath53 , the out - observable @xmath54 becomes the interaction free out - observable @xmath55 which describes a measurable property in the asymptotic region : @xmath56    the superscripts @xmath57 of state vectors @xmath49 and @xmath54 have their origins in the labels of the eigenkets @xmath58 of the full hamiltonian @xmath59 , @xmath60 the dirac basis vector expansion of ( 3b ) above holds for every @xmath49 and every @xmath54 in terms of the eigenkets @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively :    [ 2.2 ] @xmath63 @xmath64    the eigenkets @xmath58 of the full hamiltonian in are also assumed to be the plane - wave solutions to the lippmann - schwinger equations    [ 2.3 ] @xmath65    where @xmath36 fulfill the eigenvalue equation @xmath66 for the `` free hamiltonian '' @xmath67 of .    as seen from ,",
    "the eigenkets @xmath61 and @xmath62 both correspond to the same eigenvalue @xmath42 , but ( [ 2.3]@xmath57 ) shows that they fulfill different boundary conditions expressed by @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    in scattering theory , the set of functions that are admitted to serve as energy wave functions in ( [ 2.2]@xmath57 ) ,    [ 2.4 ] @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "are usually assumed to be the same set of smooth functions as the functions @xmath72 that appear in the basis vector expansion hypothesis ( a3b ) .",

    "it is noteworthy that stone s theorem requires the ( norm complete ) hilbert space @xmath87 , in contrast to , say , above .",

    "if the solutions ( [ 2.8]@xmath57 ) hold for the vectors @xmath49 and @xmath54 , then it follows , by duality , that the eigenkets @xmath61 and @xmath62 behave much like @xmath54 and @xmath49 , respectively .",

    "it is clear that and depend on the time evolution of @xmath49 and @xmath54 , given by and .",
    "the latter equations depend on the assumption that @xmath49 and @xmath54 are elements of the schwartz space @xmath9 of .",
    "therefore , if and hold , then @xmath58 must be schwartz space kets , i.e. , functionals on the schwartz space , meaning that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are infinitely differentiable , rapidly decreasing functions on the _ real _ ( and positive ) energy axis .",
    "this requirement on @xmath58 , however , is in contradiction with the requirement that @xmath58 be solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equations ( [ 2.3]@xmath57 ) which contain the complex energies @xmath96 .",
    "as already mentioned , there is a physical distinction between the vectors @xmath49 and @xmath54 as being related to experimentally accessible @xmath51 and @xmath55 for @xmath50 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , these _ asymmetric _ boundary conditions in time are what give rise to the limits @xmath97 and @xmath98 in ( [ 2.3]@xmath57 ) that define the @xmath57 signs in the kets @xmath58 .",
    "it is the term @xmath0 in ( [ 2.3]@xmath57 ) which tells us that the lippmann - schwinger kets @xmath99 can not be ordinary dirac kets ( schwartz space functionals ) .",
    "the infinitesimals @xmath0 indicate that the energy wave functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 must not only be schwartz space functions of the real variable @xmath42 , as asserted by the axiom , but they must also be limits of functions defined on some region of the upper and lower complex plane of @xmath42 .",
    "it is simplest to assume that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are boundary values of _ analytic _ functions defined on such a region in the ( open ) upper complex half - plane @xmath102 and lower complex half - plane @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "as the complex semi - plane in energy , one takes the second ( or higher ) riemann surface of the analytic @xmath1-matrix .",
    "thus , we have the following basic hypothesis which replaces :    [ 3.1 ] @xmath104 and @xmath105    to make ( [ 2.3]@xmath57 ) possible , the analytic extensions of and must exist at least on a small strip below and above on the real energy axis ( i.e. , the physical scattering energies ) .",
    "we shall generalize this to the hypothesis that the analytic extensions of the energy wave functions should exist on the entire upper and lower energy half - planes .",
    "the requirement ( [ 3.1]@xmath57 ) is not inconsistent with the schwartz space hypothesis of .",
    "rather , ( [ 3.1]@xmath57 ) strengthens .",
    "however , the stronger condition ( [ 3.1]@xmath57 ) is not consistent with the solutions ( [ 2.8]@xmath57 ) of the dynamical equations ( [ 2.7]@xmath57 ) , obtained as consequences of the weaker condition .",
    "likewise , the time evolutions equations and , which one universally assumes for ( all ) energy eigenkets , also do not hold under the hypothesis ( [ 3.1]@xmath57 ) .    as stated above , the requirements of are supplementary to the usual hypothesis of quantum mechanics .",
    "thus , the wave functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 are still assumed to be , for instant , smooth , rapidly decreasing and square integrable .",
    "the simultaneous requirements of analyticity and square integrability introduces certain ( unexpected ) restrictions into the theory . for instant ,",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that these requirements can be met for the time translated functions and only if @xmath16 .",
    ", just like the function @xmath100 is the square integrable boundary value function of an analytic function defined in the upper half - plane , then for @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 .",
    "since @xmath110 is positive , @xmath111 is bounded for arbitrary values of @xmath110 only if @xmath14 is positive .",
    "a similar argument holds for the time translation of the observable wave functions @xmath112 of . the rigorous proof is given in text following .",
    "] since the time translation equations and are derived from and , the conclusion @xmath16 also holds for the kets @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the first conclusion that we draw from the lippmann - schwinger equations ( [ 2.3]@xmath57 ) is that the time evolution of the vectors @xmath49 and @xmath54 in ( [ 2.2]@xmath57 ) should not be given by the unitary group solution of the the dynamical equations ( [ 2.7]@xmath57 ) , but by the _",
    "semigroup _ solution :    [ 3.2 ] @xmath114 @xmath115    from this we see that as a consequence of the @xmath0 in the lippmann - schwinger equations ( [ 2.3]@xmath57 ) , the @xmath47 and @xmath48 given by the dirac basis vector expansion ( [ 2.2]@xmath57 ) are in general different mathematical quantities with different ( `` conjugate '' ) semigroups ( [ 3.2]@xmath57 ) of time evolution .",
    "the unitary group evolution ( [ 2.8]@xmath57 ) which follows from is in conflict with the lippmann - schwinger equations .",
    "time evolutions which are not in conflict with the lippmann - schwinger equations ( [ 2.3]@xmath57 ) are ( [ 3.2]@xmath57 ) .",
    "thus , on the basis of ( [ 3.1]@xmath57 ) , we identify two different vector spaces @xmath116 , one for the states and the other for the observables .",
    "the operators @xmath84 and @xmath35 in are operators defined in the vector space @xmath47 .",
    "likewise , operators @xmath15 and @xmath35 in are operators defined in the vector space @xmath48 , the restriction of the hilbert space operator @xmath117 to @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the restriction of the hilbert space operator @xmath117 to @xmath120 . for the sake of notational simplicity",

    "therefore , we call the vector space @xmath122 . similarly , from , the wave functions @xmath123 are analytic in @xmath124 , and for this reason we call the vector space @xmath125",
    ". the two vector spaces @xmath126 are then two different subspaces of the hilbert space @xmath5 ( and also of the schwartz space @xmath9 ) :    [ 3.3 ] @xmath127 @xmath128    what remains now is to put additional conditions on the analytic functions ( [ 3.1]@xmath57 ) such that the spaces @xmath126 become nuclear spaces .",
    "then , the triplet of spaces    [ 3.4 ] @xmath129 @xmath130    become gelfand triplets , also known as rigged hilbert spaces .",
    "the ordinary dirac kets require one rhs .",

    "the @xmath131 in ( [ 3.4]@xmath57 ) are the dual spaces , consisting of continuous anti - linear functionals on @xmath126 .",
    "the new kets @xmath58 have then a well defined meaning as elements of the dual spaces @xmath132 , and the nuclear property of ( [ 3.4]@xmath57 ) allows dirac s basis vector expansion ( [ 2.2]@xmath57 ) to be established as the nuclear spectral theorem of gelfand _ at al _ and maurin  @xcite .",
    "the pair of gelfand triplets have been constructed by gadella  @xcite by choosing for the spaces of wave functions particular subspaces of hardy functions  @xcite[multiblock footnote omitted ]    associated with an operator defined in the hilbert space @xmath5 , there exist two triplets of operators corresponding to the two triplets of spaces in . for instant , for the hamiltonian @xmath35 ,    [ 3.6 ] @xmath133 @xmath134    where @xmath135 are the uniquely defined restrictions @xmath136 of the self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath117 to the dense subspace @xmath137 of @xmath5 .",

    "we call the ket with the energy wave function given by the breit - wigner amplitude a gamow vector because one can prove ( again , using axiom ( [ 3.7]@xmath57 ) that it fulfills .",

    "nevertheless , a beginning of time @xmath240 has been mentioned before by gell - mann and hartle in their quantum theory of the universe @xcite , where @xmath240 was chosen as the big bang time and where the restriction of the unitary group evolution to @xmath243 was introduced by fiat , in contradiction to the prediction  ( [ 2.8]@xmath57 ) of the hilbert space axiom  ( a2 ) . in our theory presented in this paper , the time asymmetry ( [ 3.2]@xmath57 ) is a consequence of our hardy space axiom ( [ 3.7]@xmath57 ) which was demanded by the heuristic ( @xmath244 ) in scattering theory ( and also in the propagator of field theory ) .",
    "we now want to answer the questions : what is the meaning of this beginning of time @xmath240 for quantum systems in experiments in the laboratory , and why have we not been more aware of its existence before ?    in the usual experiments with quantum systems",
    "one works with a large ensemble .",
    "for example , the preparation time of an excited state of an atom or ion corresponds to the many different laboratory clock times at which each individual atom or ion of the ensemble is created .",
    "the situation is different if one can work with single quantum systems . by now",
    ", there are several experiments that use single , laser - cooled ions @xcite . the original experiments used @xmath245 in a paul - straubel trap , fig .",

    "first , driven by the 493-nm dye laser ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , the ion goes from the ground state @xmath246 into the excited state @xmath247 from where it almost instantaneously ( 8 ns ) decays into state @xmath248 .",
    "second , from state @xmath248 the ion is driven back to state @xmath247 by the 650-nm dye laser ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , from where it decays into the ground state , emitting 493-nm fluorescence radiation .",
    "this fluorescence radiation is monitored by the photo multiplier tube ( pmt ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . initially , the intensity of the fluorescence radiation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] is essentially a constant at about 16,000 counts / sec .",
    "then , at the time `` lamp on '' , a 455-nm filtered barium lamp ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) is turned on .",
    "after this `` lamp - on '' time , the fluorescence radiation changes rapidly at random times from the initial value of 16,000 counts / sec to the background value of no fluorescence .",
    "the explanation is the following : the barium lamp occasionally excites the @xmath245 into the state @xmath249 from where it makes a fast transition into the state @xmath250 .",
    "this is a metastable state described by the gamow vector @xmath251 .",
    "since there is only one @xmath245 atom , it can either go through the transition levels @xmath252 or be `` shelved '' in the metastable state @xmath250 . while it is shelved there can not be fluorescent radiation @xmath253 , which results in a dark period .    .",

    "a theoretical prediction of the quantity @xmath284 can be made in terms of the resonance width , as shown below .",
    "the individual times @xmath279 are _ not predictable _ quantities in quantum mechanics .",
    "let us now turn to the description of the state @xmath250 by the gamow state @xmath260 and the problem of the physical meaning of the beginning semigroup time @xmath240 . as discussed above ,",
    "the ensemble state @xmath250 consists of a large number of individual quantum physical systems , each created at a different laboratory time @xmath275 .",
    "these times depend on the preparation conditions such as the intensity of the barium lamp ( in the present experiment , it is chosen such that a transition to @xmath285 takes place once every 10 s ) .",
    "however , as seen from , the reproducible experimental quantities depend only on the time intervals @xmath279 , and not on the individual creation times @xmath275 or the decay times @xmath278 .",
    "the time interval @xmath286 is clearly invariant under a translation by @xmath287 , i.e. , @xmath288 .",
    "now , a time @xmath287 can be chosen for each laboratory creation time @xmath275 such that @xmath289 where the time @xmath240 is independent of the index @xmath274 . the particular choice @xmath239 ( i.e. , @xmath290 ) corresponds to the beginning semigroup evolution time of the gamow state @xmath260 .",
    "what shows , above all , is that the individual micro - physical systems that make up an ensemble described by a quantum mechanical state can be prepared at different times ( and , for that matter , different points in space ) .",
    "the time @xmath239 of provides a reference time for the entire ensemble of the creation times @xmath291 , @xmath292 thus , the individual systems of the ensemble can be treated as if they were created at the same laboratory time and the duration that each micro system `` lives '' can simply be characterized by the time at which it decays .",
    "this feature makes it possible to describe the entire ensemble by a single gamow state vector @xmath293 and the time evolution of the entire ensemble by a single time variable @xmath294 .",
    "such a state vector description , in turn , makes it possible to use the standard probability interpretation also for an ensemble that consists of a large number of micro systems created at vastly different laboratory times . for instance , by using for the gamow vector @xmath295 , the lifetime of the excited state @xmath250 can be computed in analogy to as : @xmath296 the experimental quantity of is to be compared with this theoretical quantity .",
    "new in these remarkable experiments of @xcite is that the different creation times @xmath275 and durations times @xmath279 for the single quantum systems are precisely and individually measured as the onset and duration of the dark periods of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "these onset times are an experimental demonstration of the semigroup time @xmath239 of time asymmetric quantum theory .",
    "many of the heuristic notions used in the description of scattering and decay phenomena , like the incoming and outgoing lippmann - schwinger kets @xmath297 with infinitesimal @xmath110 , purely outgoing boundary conditions , time asymmetry and causality are not well defined in the mathematical frame set by the conventional ( hilbert space ) quantum mechanics .",
    "combining these notions with the hilbert space axiom leads to contradictions , like the exponential catastrophe in which gamow vectors and unitary time evolution conflicted @xcite , the deviations from the exponential decay where the exponential time dependence for the experimental counting rates conflicted with the mathematical properties of hilbert space vectors @xcite , and the problems with ( einstein ) causality where stability of matter ( semi - boundedness of the hilbert space hamiltonian ) leads to instant propagation of probabilities @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 of the lippmann - schwinger kets ( or , of the propagator in relativistic quantum field theory ) overcomes many of these problems .",
    "but the lippmann - schwinger kets are mathematically undefined kets ; they are not vectors of the hilbert space and they can not be defined as schwartz space functionals because of the @xmath0 . therefore one can not derive their time evolution ( or , in the relativistic case , their evolution under poincar transformations ) .",
    "nevertheless , one _ assumes _ it to be a unitary time evolution ( as one also had _ assumed _ for the ordinary dirac kets ) with time extending over @xmath17 .",
    "this however is in conflict with the infinitesimal imaginary part @xmath0 since it would lead to non - continuous and unbounded ( non - unitary ) operators for time evolution ( or , in the relativistic case , non - unitary representations of the poincar group ) .",
    "complex extensions of energy ( or , in the relativistic case , the invariant square mass @xmath298 ) away from the real axis requires that the energy wave functions be boundary values of analytic functions in the complex semi - planes , not just ( lebesgue ) square - integrable or smooth functions of real energy .    using the lippmann - schwinger equation as the takeoff point and attempting to accommodate as many of the heuristic notions of scattering and decay as possible",
    ", we conjectured in this paper the new hypothesis ( [ 3.7]@xmath57 ) .",
    "it replaces the hilbert space boundary conditions ( a2 ) for the solutions of the schrdinger or heisenberg equation by the hardy space boundary conditions ( [ 3.7]@xmath57 ) .",
    "many of the heuristic notions , such as gamow s wave functions , that had been introduced phenomenologically into the description of scattering and decay phenomena appear also in this new quantum theory , but now they have a rigorous mathematical foundation .",
    "furthermore , the new theory leads to important novel conclusions , salient among which is a basic , quantum mechanical time asymmetry , expressed by the semigroup evolution of ( [ 3.7.5]@xmath57 ) .",
    "this overcomes the causality problem and leads to exponential decay for certain kets with complex energy , the gamow kets .",
    "gamow kets have been derived from the resonance poles of the @xmath1-matrix using the new axiom ( [ 3.7]@xmath57 ) , their energy wave function is a lorentzian ( breit - wigner ) energy distribution characterized by its central value @xmath221 and width @xmath222 , and the lifetime of its exponential decay is exactly @xmath299 .",
    "the new axiom ( [ 3.7]@xmath57 ) thus provides a unified theory of resonance scattering and exponential decay .",
    "but the semigroup also introduces a beginning of time for quantum systems , which is represented by the mathematical semigroup time @xmath2 .",
    "though such a time has been mentioned before as the big bang time for universes @xcite and its idea is already contained in the classic paper @xcite , one has not been much aware of it in the usual experiments with quantum systems in the laboratory . in the final section [ sec4 ] , we therefore discussed an experiment with single laser - cooled @xmath245 ions in a trap @xcite where the beginnings of time for single micro - systems have been observed .",
