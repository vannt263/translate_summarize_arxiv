    "our proof also works in pl and top categories . recall that a homotopy equivalence @xmath4 of @xmath1-manifolds is _ tangential _ if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are stably isomorphic , where @xmath7 denotes the tangent bundle if @xmath8 is a smooth manifold and the tangent microbundle in the pl or top cases . by  (",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) this is equivalent to requiring that @xmath9 is homotopic to a cat - homeomorphism for some @xmath10 ( where cat equals diff , pl or top ) .",
    "\\(1 ) a result of curtis - kwun  @xcite that for a boundary connected sum @xmath13 of a countable family of compact @xmath1-manifolds , the homeomorphism type of @xmath14 determines the isomorphism class of @xmath15 .",
    "\\(2 ) a recent result of calcut - king - siebenmann  @xcite that any countable collection of cat properly embedded @xmath16 s in @xmath2 is cat unknotted , which generalizes classical results of cantrell and stallings .",

    "( such examples can be found in  @xcite , and more examples are now known , see e.g. casson - harer  @xcite for aspherical homology @xmath17-spheres that bound smooth contractible @xmath18-manifolds , while kervaire  @xcite showed that the fundamental group of any homology @xmath17-sphere appears as the fundamental group of the boundary of a smooth contractible @xmath1-manifolds for any @xmath11 ) .",
    "since @xmath3 is open , it contains a cat properly embedded ray whose cat regular neighborhood is an embedded closed halfspace , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) .",
    "hence @xmath3 is cat isomorphic to the interior of a noncompact manifold @xmath19 whose boundary is an open disk . by the strong version of the cantrell - stalling hyperplane unknotting theorem proved in  ( * ? ? ?",

    "the proof of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) is quite technical , which may be due to the fact that the tools of siebenmann s thesis were not yet available at the time , so we summarize it in a modern language : given @xmath45 it is easy to construct a cofinal family @xmath46 of neighborhoods of infinity in @xmath35 such that in the corresponding inverse sequence of fundamental groups , the group @xmath47 is the free product of @xmath48 , and the map @xmath49 is a retraction onto the first @xmath50 factors , and in particular , is surjective .",
    "hence the inverse sequence of groups is mittag - leffler , and therefore its pro - equivalence class depends only on the homeomorphism type of @xmath35 .",
    "now if @xmath35 , @xmath37 have homeomorphic interiors , then a simple diagram chase in the commutative diagram from the definition of pro - equivalence shows that each free factor of @xmath51 occurs as a free factor of @xmath52 , so @xmath43 .",

    "this makes analyzing the fundamental group of infinity more delicate . for the same reason we do not attempt to prove theorem  [ thm : univ cover not rn ] for @xmath3",
    "whose universal cover is not @xmath2 .    by the cartan - hadamard theorem",
    "any ( complete riemannian ) @xmath1-manifold of nonpositive curvature is covered by @xmath2 .",
