    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the `` crab - like '' or `` plerionic '' class ( weiler & panagia 1978 ) are characterized by compact , filled - center radio morphology , with relatively flat spectral index ( @xmath1 0.0  0.3 , where @xmath2 ) .",
    "the common interpretation is that these remnants are pulsar - powered , although direct evidence of an associated pulsar is often lacking .",
    "roughly 5% of the currently cataloged galactic snrs ( green 1998 ) are included in this class , with another 710% classified as `` composite '' remnants showing plerionic cores accompanied by shells with steeper radio indices ( @xmath3 0.4  0.7 ) .",
    "the shell - like component is associated with the supernova blast wave and ejecta . in x - rays ,",
    "the plerionic remnants show nonthermal spectra characteristic of synchrotron emission while the shell components typically display line - dominated thermal emission , although the shell - type snrs sn  1006 and g347.3 - 0.5 are dominated by nonthermal x - rays ( koyama et  al .",
    "1995 ; slane et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the absence of any shell or halo of fast - moving ejecta in the crab nebula , 3c58 , and other plerionic remnants may be simply the result of a low ambient density which precludes the formation of a detectable shock .",
    "evidence of  voids around some filled - center remnants ( wallace , landecker , & taylor 1994 ) lends support to this hypothesis , although results for g21.50.9  in particular are inconclusive .",
    "however , g74.9 + 1.2 and g63.7 + 1.1 are filled - center snrs which show no evidence of fast - moving halos of ejecta , but which appear to be interacting directly with surrounding material ( wallace , landecker , taylor , & pineault 1997 ; wallace , landecker & taylor 1997 ) .",
    "such an interpretation , if correct , could suggest some neutron stars form from under - energetic explosions in which very little material is ejected . further searches for evidence of extended shell / halo components in crab - like remnants",
    "is thus of considerable importance .",
    "g21.50.9  is a compact snr that exhibits strong linear polarization and centrally peaked emission in the radio band ( morsi & reich 1987 ) . the radio spectral index is @xmath4 for @xmath5  ghz , which puts it in the class of crab - like snrs . a steepening of the spectrum is observed beyond 32  ghz ( salter et  al . 1989 ) .",
    "previous x - ray observations reveal a similar morphology ( becker & szymkowiak 1981 ) with a hard x - ray spectrum ( davelaar , smith , & becker 1986 ) . to date",

    "the bright source is positionally coincident with the emission - line star ss 397 .",
    "neutral hydrogen absorption measurements place g21.50.9  at a distance of @xmath6 kpc ( becker & szymkowiak 1981 ) . throughout this letter",
    "we assume @xmath7  kpc and show the scaling of relevant quantities with @xmath8  kpc explicitly .",
    "the radio luminosity of g21.50.9  is @xmath9 ( @xmath5 ghz ; morsi & reich 1987 ) , and it has a lower @xmath10 ratio than the crab ; it is a factor of @xmath11 less luminous in the radio and a factor of @xmath12 less in x - rays .",
    "previous measurements fail to show evidence of any extended component outside the plerion .",
    "g21.50.9  has been observed regularly as a calibration target for the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( weisskopf , odell , & van speybroeck 1996 ) .",
    "here we concentrate on an early set of observations carried out on 23 aug 1999 and 25 october 1999 .",
    "we select acis observations with the remnant placed on the s3 chip , where the best focus is achieved , and use these for both spectral and spatial information .",
    "we use observations with the hrc to obtain the highest angular ( @xmath13 arcsec ) and time resolution information .",
    "the observations used for this study are summarized in table 1 .",
    "+    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure 1 ( left ) we present the hrc image of the plerion . at the center of the x - ray image is a bright compact region which contains @xmath14 of the total flux .",
    "this central emission is extended beyond the @xmath13  arcsec resolution of the telescope , however .",
    "a comparison of the emission profile with that for a point source at the same on - axis position in the hrc reveals an extent of @xmath15  arcsec ( fig .",
    "1 ) , corresponding to a source size of @xmath16  pc .",
    "an investigation of timing data from the central region yields no significant evidence for pulsations ; we derive an upper limit of @xmath0 for the pulsed fraction in the hrc bandpass ( @xmath1710  kev ) assuming a sinusoidal light curve .",
    "the next largest structure is the main body of the plerion , which has a radius of roughly 30 arcsec , with some variation in size  particularly in the northwestern region which shows a distinct indentation .",
    "the acis data for the plerion reveals a nonthermal spectrum with energy index @xmath18 and a column density @xmath19 .",
    "the latter is consistent with the  absorption measurements ( davelaar , smith , & becker 1986 ) .",
    "here we have used a radius of 40 arcsec to extract events from the entire plerion ; background was taken from regions of the same detector well - separated from the remnant . for comparison ,",
    "we have used _ asca _ data to fit the spectrum and find excellent agreement with the values derived from the _ chandra _ data .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the plerion is @xmath20 .",
    "when the column density is fixed at the value above , we find that the spectral index varies with radius , as indicated in figure 2 .",
    "this spectral softening with increasing radius , which is also observed for 3c58 ( torii et  al .",
    "2000 ) , is consistent with synchrotron burn - off of electrons accelerated in the central regions ; due to the short synchrotron lifetime for higher energy electrons , only the lower energy component is able to survive to the outer regions of the plerion .",
    "the spectral index of the compact core is @xmath21 , similar to that of the crab pulsar .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result from the acis observations is the presence of a very faint outer shell or halo in g21.50.9 . as illustrated in figure 1 ( right ) ,",
    "the shell radius is roughly 1.2  2 arcmin , corresponding @xmath22  pc .",
    "the faint shell is incomplete in the southwest , and shows several knots in the northern region .",
    "the spectrum of this outer region is difficult to quantify at this early stage of the _ chandra _ calibration efforts . using data with a combined integration time of 33.5 ks",
    ", we obtained four spectra with a total of @xmath23 counts ; these spectra were fit simultaneously .",
    "combining data from observations with different ccd chips is , as this stage , not possible .",
    "the spectrum , which is relatively hard , can be adequately described by either a power law or an optically thin thermal spectrum ( e.g. raymond & smith 1977 ) .",
    "the results are listed in table 2 .",
    "2. variation of power law index with radius for the synchrotron core of g21.50.9 .",
    "the nonthermal nature of the x - ray emission from the core of g21.50.9  indicates the presence of a central pulsar that powers the synchrotron nebula .",
    "x - ray studies of pulsars indicate a correlation between the total nonthermal x - ray luminosity of the systems and the spin - down power @xmath24 of the pulsar ( _ e.g. _ seward & wang 1988 , becker & trmper 1997 ) .",
    "our best fit for this relation gives @xmath25 where we have used 0.12.4 kev luminosity values .",
    "using the luminosity in table 2 , we infer the presence of a pulsar with @xmath26 .",
    "this is large for the general pulsar population , but reasonable for a young pulsar associated with a synchrotron nebula .",
    "applying standard synchrotron emission calculations ( ginzburg & syrovatskii 1965 ) to the radio spectrum from g21.50.9 , under the assumption of a power law electron distribution ( cf .",
    "harrus , hughes , & slane 1998 ) , we derive a nebular magnetic field @xmath27 and a magnetic pressure @xmath28 .    balancing the ram pressure of a pulsar - driven wind ( @xmath29 , where the wind covers a fraction @xmath30 of a sphere ) with the nebular magnetic pressure",
    ", we estimate a termination shock radius @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to an angular size of @xmath32  arcsec for the distance and nebular size estimates used above .",
    "interestingly , this is consistent with the apparent extent of the central source in g21.50.9  ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it may be that the pulsar itself is hidden from our view beneath the shroud of the termination shock .",
    "for the crab pulsar , radio observations reveal filamentary `` wisps '' ( bietenholz & kronberg 1992 ) thought to be produced at this boundary zone where the pulsar wind begins decelerating through interactions with the surrounding medium ( rees & gunn 1974 ) .",
    "similar evidence of a radio wisp is observed in 3c 58 ( frail & moffett 1993 ) , and the separation of the feature from the compact x - ray source observed in this snr ( helfand , becker , & white 1995 ) appears compatible with calculations of the expected termination shock distance ( torii et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum of the plerion as a whole to infrared frequencies is inconsistent with the measured iso flux ( gallant & tuffs 1998 ) ; the measured ir flux exceeds the prediction .",
    "this curious result may result from oversimplification of the x - ray spectrum , however . as shown in figure 2 , the spectral index increases with radius .",
    "a value of @xmath33 , compatible with the outer regions of the nebula , provides good agreement upon extrapolation to the ir band .",
    "alternatively , this may be indicative of the time evolution of the energy input into the nebula from the central source .",
    "we note that the x - ray core has no observed counterpart in the radio or infrared bands .",
    "the faint , extended halo of emission from g21.50.9  presumably represents the contribution from the snr ejecta , with the brighter clumps in the northwest being associated with regions where the ejecta have encountered material of higher density .",
    "faint arcs discernible in figure 1 could be indicative of a reverse shock being driven into the expanding ejecta .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray emission from the diffuse halo could be dominated by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated at the shock front as proposed for sn  1006 and g347.30.5 .",
    "the presence of an extended x - ray halo surrounding the crab - like core of g21.50.9 raises the question of whether there is also an extended radio halo corresponding to the shell morphology seen in the vast majority of radio snrs .",
    "we have examined archival very large array ( vla ) data , and find no radio shell around g21.50.9 down to a 1  ghz surface brightness limit ( 1@xmath34 ) of @xmath35  w  m@xmath36  hz@xmath37  sr@xmath37 . while this is sufficient to detect most young snrs , at least one crab - like source , g322.50.1 , has a shell component which",
    "would not be seen down to this limit ( whiteoak 1992 ) .",
    "if the extended halo truly represents the fast - moving ejecta , we would expect the spectrum to reveal characteristic emission line features from the hot gas . as summarized in table 2",
    ", the best - fit spectrum is an absorbed power law .",
    "while we present results with the column density fixed to that obtained for the plerion , we note that slightly better spectral fits are obtained for a somewhat lower value of @xmath38 .",
    "a model for thermal emission ( raymond & smith 1977 ) provides an adequate fit ( though inferior to the power law ) with a temperature of @xmath39 kev .",
    "based upon the thermal model , the mean density of the emitting material is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angular radius of the shell in units of 1.5  arcmin , and @xmath42 is the fraction of the spherical volume comprising the x - ray emission .",
    "the mass of the emitting material is then @xmath43 .",
    "with such a small amount of swept up material , g21.50.9  is still dynamically young .",
    "if the extended emission is nonthermal , then g21.50.9  joins sn  1006 and g347.30.5 as remnants whose shell emission is dominated by nonthermal processes in x - rays .",
    "the absence of an observed radio shell is consistent with the low radio surface brightness of these other remnants . more importantly , since the plerionic core in g21.50.9  implies a massive progenitor , while sn  1006 is the result of a type ia explosion",
    ", the addition of g21.50.9  to this class would imply that the nonthermal x - ray shells are related more to environment than to progenitor type .",
    "the early _ chandra _ observations of g21.50.9  have revealed new information on all spatial scales .",
    "the variation in spectral index with radius in the plerion supports the view that a central object injects energetic electrons into the surrounding region , and that the lower energy particles , whose synchrotron radiation lifetimes are longest , predominate at the outskirts of the nebula .",
    "the center of the plerion shows a compact core which presumably contains a neutron star that powers the system , but this core is not point - like ; an extended shroud , possibly associated with the pulsar wind termination shock , apparently hides the pulsar itself .",
    "no pulsations are detected from the central region .",
    "on the largest scales , a faint halo of emission is observed , with some evidence of arcs and clump - like features .",
    "this may correspond to the contribution from the fast - moving ejecta , although the spectral information is too sparse to quantify the nature of the emission in detail .",
    "if this component does indeed correspond to the ejecta component , then g21.50.9  does not fall into the proposed category of low explosion energy remnants with no ejecta proposed as possible progenitors to the class of plerionic snrs .",
    "deeper observations of the remnant are needed to better constrain this extended component .",
    "upcoming studies with xmm have an excellent chance of clarifying this situation .",
