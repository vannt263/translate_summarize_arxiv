    "recent advances in epitaxial growth techniques , such as molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , make possible to fabricate high quality si @xmath0-doped layers in gaas . in these systems ,",

    ", a two - dimensional electron gas can be realized by planar doping of gaas at high donor concentration.@xcite devices based on @xmath0-doped heterostructures are currently under extensive investigation for high - speed electronic and optoelectronic applications ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "for some examples of the practical advantages of @xmath0-doping ) .",
    "hence the interest of a good understanding of si @xmath0-doped gaas as a representative example of those devices .",
    "theoretical studies of the above systems usually neglect possible effects of disorder due to the random distribution of impurities in order to simplify the analysis .",
    "indeed , currently available techniques allow for an optimal control of the growing heterostructure , thus justifying the assumption that the ionized impurity atoms are homogeneously distributed inside the @xmath0-doped layers .",
    "this approximation has been recently shown to be correct in the high - density limit.@xcite a number of researches have considered this limit within different approaches , like the thomas - fermi,@xcite local density approximation ( lda ) , @xcite and hartree methods.@xcite these previous works show that in the absence of external fields the thomas - fermi semiclassical approach is equivalent to a self - consistent formulation in a wide range of doping concentrations.@xcite the effects of applied electric field have recently been considered in the case of single and periodically si @xmath0-doped gaas @xcite by using a generalized thomas - fermi formalism . in this framework one",
    "first computes the one - electron potential in the absence of electric field and then tilts it to account for the electric potential .",
    "it has thus been found that the well - known stark ladders , already observed in quantum - well based superlattices,@xcite should also be clearly revealed in periodically si @xmath0-doped gaas .",
    "nevertheless , this _ ad hoc _ procedure might be incapable to describe all the phenomenology arising in @xmath0-doped heterostructures : a fully self - consistent approach may reveal interesting issues about the behavior of actual structures under bias voltage not accounted for within simpler approaches .",
    "as an example of new phenomenology found by self - consistent procedures , we mention that , in superlattice - like systems , the hartree potential from electrons of different wells partly screens the effect of the electric field leading to the formation of electric field domains . the physical existence of electric field domains is firmly established in gaas - ga@xmath1al@xmath2as @xcite superlattices ( see ref .   and references therein ) . to our knowledge , however ,",
    "there have been no reports in the literature about field domains in @xmath0-doped gaas superlattices .",
    "note that in this case there is a number of free carriers in the structure and , as a consequence , it is possible for the electric field to break up into two or more regions with different field strengths , i.e. , electric field domains .",
    "similarly , it would not be strange to observe other unexpected phenomena when a more complete theoretical analysis of @xmath0-doped systems under applied fields is carried out .",
    "it is therefore clear that a careful self - consistent analysis of this kind of devices is necessary to make sure what their properties as well as their possible applications are .",
    "the work we report on in this paper is a first step in the aforementioned direction .",
    "we have concerned ourselves with the self - consistent study of a single si @xmath0-doped layer in gaas under an applied electric field .",
    "the aim of addressing this question is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", we intend to implement and improve an efficient self - consistent procedure to analyze this simple structure , thus developing the necessary skills to face the full superlattice problem .",
    "it is important to realize that a self - consistent study of a complex heterostructure requires a well developed technique to prevent expensive calculations . on the other hand",
    ", we believe that only after reaching a thorough knowledge of the phenomena appearing in a single layer it will be possible to proceed further , in order to asses the electronic structure of periodically si @xmath0-doped gaas superlattices . in addition , if our work showed new features of the single layer problem , we could foresee the subsequent , unexpected phenomena which would be likely to arise in the superlattice , as well as estimate the range of parameters for which they might take place .",
    "therefore , a complete understanding of charge distribution and subband energy dependence on the applied electric field in a single si @xmath0-doped gaas layer is necessary . with this double goal in mind",
    ", we undertook the study of the quantum confined stark effect in these structures by considering a @xmath0-doping layer in a quantum well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly discuss our model , in which we use a scalar hamiltonian within the effective - mass approximation to describe the electron dynamics .",
    "the one - electron potential due to the combined action of the ionized donors in the single @xmath0-doped layer and the applied electric field is found by simultaneously solving the schrdinger and poisson equations .",
    "section iii is devoted to a summary of the numerical method we apply to obtain ( i ) the one - electron potential , ( ii ) the subband structure dependence upon the applied electric field , ( iii ) the subband occupation as a function of the field , ( iv ) the spatial charge distribution , and ( v ) the oscillator strength for intersubband transitions when the whole structure is confined between two infinitely high barriers in an applied electric field ( quantum confined stark effect ) . results and discussions are collected in sec .",
    "iv and , finally , sec .",
    "v ends the paper with a brief recollection of results and some comments on possible physical consequences and technological applications of our results in new devices .",
    "the system we study in this work is a semiconductor structure made of a single si @xmath0-doped gaas layer .",
    "we consider a slab of gaas of thickness @xmath3 confined between two infinitely high barriers with a si @xmath0-doping layer embedded in its center .",
    "we assume that the doping layer consists of a continuous slab of thickness @xmath4 with @xmath5 ionized donors per unit area . in what follows",
    "we neglect the unintentional @xmath6-type background doping appearing in most mbe - grown samples .",
    "this is not a serious limitation since actual techniques can keep this doping level very low ( less than @xmath7@xmath8 acceptors ) .",
    "for such a low residual doping , the well shape below the fermi level @xmath9 is almost insensitive to the background acceptors.@xcite    we assume the validity of the effective - mass approximation and take an isotropic and parabolic conduction - band in the growth direction .",
    "this approximation usually works fine in gaas , except a very high electric fields , when @xmath10 mixing induced by the field occurs .",
    "@xcite kane s parameter ( @xmath11mev ) and the conduction - band modulation are much smaller than the bandgap in gaas , and the coupling between host bands is small , so that a scalar hamiltonian suffices to properly describe the electronic conduction - band states in @xmath0-doped gaas.@xcite in the envelope function approach , the electronic wave function corresponding to the @xmath12-subband may be factorized as follows @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the in - plane wavevector and spatial coordinates , respectively . here",

    "then , envelope functions and electron energies can be found as a function of the applied field . once these magnitudes are computed , it is easy to obtain the charge distribution and subband occupations .",
    "in addition , regarding field - dependent intersubband transitions from a state @xmath44 into a state @xmath12 , it becomes most important to determine the corresponding oscillator strength @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the free - electron mass .",
    "device applications of intersubband transitions require a large stark shift with a high oscillator strength .",
    "for example , it is known that square quantum wells exhibit a weak intersubband transition @xcite but it can be improved by inserting one narrow well inside a wider one . @xcite",
    "therefore it is interesting , from a technological viewpoint , to compare the oscillator strength in @xmath0-doped structures with typical values obtained in quantum wells .",

    "the problem above is nothing but the diagonalization of the symmetric , tridiagonal @xmath85 matrix @xmath86 , defined as @xmath87 @xmath88 being the @xmath12-th eigenvalue and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) the @xmath91-th component of the @xmath12-th eigenvector , with @xmath12 running from 1 to @xmath92 .",

    "the solution , @xmath106 , of this linear system can be readily obtained through the standard thomas s algorithm , which amounts to computing the solution iteratively , as follows : @xmath107 with the index @xmath12 running backwards ( @xmath108 ) , and where @xmath109 @xmath110 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , and @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) being the diagonal , subdiagonal , and superdiagonal elements of the matrix @xmath102 respectively ( in our case , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) .",
    "note that the undefined elements @xmath117 and @xmath118 appearing in eq .",

    "the self - consistent algorithm consists of the following steps :    1 .",

    "2 .   set @xmath120 .",
    "3 .   compute @xmath121 as given by eq .",

    "determine @xmath122 through the recurrence ( [ eq19 ] ) ( notice that the coefficients @xmath123 and @xmath124 only have to be computed once at the beginning of the program ) . 8 .",
    "check for convergence ( by comparing , for instance , @xmath125 with @xmath126 ) ; if tolerance has been attained then exit the self - consistence process with @xmath127 .",
    "9 .   otherwise set @xmath128 and repeat from step 2 on .",
    "the parameter @xmath129 has been introduced to control the iteration : if @xmath130 we will have @xmath131 forever , while if @xmath132 , @xmath106 will undergo its maximum variation at every step .",
    "this latter case ( commonly used throughout literature ) has proven not to converge for @xmath133 @xmath134 .",
    "instead , @xmath135 makes the process convergent for any set of parameters .",
    "the numerical parameters we have been using are as follows . our mesh consisted of 501 points , enough as to resolve the physical dimensions of the delta layer potential we will describe below .",
    "we have checked our numerical procedure by using smaller and larger numbers of grid points , finding a negligible dependence on this parameter , as desired .",
    "we chose to stop the iterative procedure when the relative variation of the fermi energy was @xmath136 .",
    "we also used another criterium , namely computing the integral of the absolute value of the difference between the new and old potentials and stopping when it was less than @xmath137 , obtaining again good agreement between both conditions .",
    "typical runs attained convergence after about 20 hartree iterations , each one of them taking around 30 s of cpu time on a hp 9000/715/75 with the above integration parameters .",
    "this shows that our procedure is rather efficient , and we are confident that it will allow us to deal with the superlattice problem without prohibitive cpu time requirements .",
    "the different magnitudes we are interested in have been obtained taking @xmath138 and @xmath139 in gaas . since the dependence of the subband structure upon donor concentration ( @xmath140 ) , its distribution width ( @xmath4 ) and the thickness ( @xmath3 )",
    "are well understood in the absence of external fields,@xcite even if the whole structure is embedded in a quantum well,@xcite we have fixed their values and concerned ourselves with the dependence on temperature and electric field . in our numerical simulations",
    "we have set @xmath141@xmath134 , @xmath142  and @xmath143 .",
    "this choice , with the above numerical parameters , gives our calculation a resolution of 1 .",
    "the maximum electric field we have considered is @xmath144kv @xmath63 , well below the value for which @xmath10 mixing may be observed , thus remaining within the validity range of our scalar hamiltonian .",
    "we have studied three typical temperatures , namely those of liquid helium , @xmath145k , liquid nitrogen , @xmath146k , and room temperature , @xmath147k .    in the absence of applied electric field ,",
    "the confining potential presents the characteristic v - shape profile , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the origin of energies of all curves is the fermi level . on increasing the electric field the potential",
    "is tilted so that it becomes slightly asymmetric ( see fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath148kv@xmath63 ) .",
    "this behavior is also predicted by means of the thomas - fermi approach , as mentioned above .",
    "@xcite this trend holds until a critical value of the electric field @xmath149 ( about @xmath150kv@xmath63 , see below ) is reached . for higher strengths of the electric field , the confining potential changes dramatically its shape and a second minimum appears at the left barrier .",
    "therefore , a local potential barrier arises between the center and the left barrier of the structure , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath144kv@xmath63 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the transition between these two different regimes is very sharp . in other words",
    ", @xmath151 drops @xmath152mev in a very narrow interval , @xmath153 , of electric fields .",
    "this phenomenon can be thought of as arising from competition between opposite effects : on one side , the electric field pushes the charge distribution to the left , and on the other side , electronic repulsion prevents charge accumulation on that part of the system .",
    "the different shapes of the confining potential for @xmath28 smaller or larger than @xmath149 must strongly influence the subband structure and the corresponding subband occupation , as it actually occurs .",
    "results at different temperatures are collected in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in this figure",
    "we have only plotted those subbands whose electron densities @xmath42 are at least @xmath154 of the ground state occupation .",
    "as expected , the occupation of subbands above the ground state increases with temperature .",
    "the subband energies depend only slightly on the applied electric field up to a critical field @xmath155kv@xmath63 , at which a sudden drop of the levels is observed .",
    "this value of @xmath149 is almost the same for @xmath156k and @xmath157k , whereas at room temperature is somewhat smaller .",
    "it is clear that this drop of the levels is related with the rapid change in the value of @xmath151 and the subsequent appearance of the local maximum around @xmath158 .",
    "this behavior is very different to the quantum confined stark effect in quantum wells , where subbands change smoothly with @xmath28.@xcite the subband occupations at three different temperatures and three different values of the electric field are shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the occupation of the lowest subband is almost independent of @xmath61 and @xmath28 .",
    "on increasing temperature , more and more subbands are populated , as mentioned above .",
    "the most significant feature when increasing the electric field is that the occupation of the excited subbands increases rapidly for fields above @xmath149 .",
    "this fact is remarkable at low temperature , for which the first excited state has an occupation of @xmath159 ( in units of @xmath160@xmath134 ) for @xmath161 while it increases two orders of magnitude for @xmath162 .",
    "hence band filling also changes dramatically when crossing @xmath149 .    according to our previous results",
    ", the spatial charge distribution should also be strongly influenced by the applied electric field . to elucidate these effects",
    ", we have calculated the squared envelope functions at low temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . at zero field",
    "the envelope functions present a well defined parity since @xmath163 is an even function ; thus the electron density @xmath32 is symmetric around the @xmath0-doping layer .",
    "on increasing the electric field , the expected value @xmath164 shifts to the left , in the same fashion as in ordinary quantum wells .",
    "however , electric fields larger than @xmath149 cause the first excited state to be located very close to the left barrier due to the presence of the potential minimum at @xmath165 . therefore , spatial charge distribution undergo a large shift to the left for @xmath162 , which must clearly have profound effects on intersubband transitions between the first excited subband and the ground subband .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where @xmath166 is plotted as a function of the electric field at three different temperatures .",
    "below @xmath149 the oscillator strength is almost constant and presents a high value , close to @xmath167 , which is even larger than that obtained for a narrow gaas - ga@xmath1al@xmath2as quantum well inside a wider one .",
    "@xcite thus , for instance , @xmath168kv@xmath169kv@xmath170 .",
    "but contrary to quantum wells , @xmath166 decays very fast for electric fields larger than @xmath149 , so that , for instance , @xmath171kv@xmath172kv@xmath173 .",
    "this change is practically the same for the two lowest temperatures , the magnitude of the jump becoming smaller at room temperature ; nevertheless , the drop of @xmath166 is equally abrupt for all temperatures . in closing this section",
    ", we note that this drop of the oscillator strength arises from the fact that the secondary well , newly formed , begins to confine charge . as a result ,",
    "the overlapping between the ground and the first excited states is small , and transitions between both subbands become tunneling - like , leading to a sharp decrease of @xmath166 .",
    "in the present work we have studied single si @xmath0-doped gaas under an electric field applied parallel to the growth direction . electronic structure and intersubband transitions",
    "have been calculated by solving the schrdinger and poisson equations self - consistently . to this end , we have developed a very efficient numerical code which paves the way to self - consistent studies of @xmath0-doped superlattices .",
    "as regards the specific system we deal with here , one of the most significant results is the existence of a critical value of the electric field @xmath149 separating two very different behaviors of the quantum confined stark effect , which is very different from what happens in quantum wells .",
    "this critical field is related to the fact that the confining potential develops a second minimum at the left barrier . as a consequence",
    ", we have observed that the subband energies present a step - like shape as a function of the electric field , with a sharp decrease at @xmath149 .",
    "this is accompanied by a marked increase of the occupation of the first excited subband and a strong shift of the spatial charge distribution .",
    "finally , the oscillator strength for intersubband transitions is very large and almost constant below @xmath149 but vanishes quickly above @xmath149 .",
    "interestingly , this sharp change in the confining potential shape poses a number of questions about the behavior of superlattices . from what we now know , it is not clear whether the appearance of an intermediate barrier will help form electric field domains or , on the contrary , will prevent them due to loss of coherence .",
    "it is conceivable that electric field domains will appear below @xmath149 , where the phenomenology is similar to that of quantum - well - based superlattices .",
    "the situation is more intriguing above @xmath149 , because the splitting of the quantum well into two wells might or might not survive in the superlattice .",
    "the consequences of the preservation of this effect are difficult to predict , as in that case the superlattice might exhibit a double periodicity or become aperiodic .",
    "if double periodicity arises , it could induce unusual electron transport properties , like those predicted for the so - called dimer superlattices .",
    "@xcite in addition , it is also evident that the well splitting phenomenon will have consequences as to possible resonant tunneling effects , not only in superlattices , but also in double @xmath0-doped layer structures .",
    "these and related questions are clearly worth studying , and work along these lines is now in progress.@xcite    finally , we want to end the paper with a few comments on applications of what we have found .",
    "as to applications , the fact that the oscillator strength undergoes a sudden drop allows us to suggest that structures made out of si @xmath0-doped gaas embedded in a quantum well may be of use as optical filters . note that dipolar transitions @xmath174 show a negligible probability above @xmath149 ; as these two subbands contain most of the carriers , this will be the relevant transition governing the optical response of the device .",
    "it is important to recall that the value of @xmath149 is almost independent on temperature , so that such a device could be used in a wide range of temperatures . in addition , it is clear that the value of @xmath149 could be adjusted by changing @xmath175 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , this kind of structure may open the possibility of fabricating new optoelectronic devices .",
