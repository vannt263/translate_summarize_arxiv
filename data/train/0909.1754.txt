    "in the nonsupersymmetric @xmath9 extension of the standard @xmath10 model ( sm ) of particle interactions , the higgs sector must be enlarged from the one @xmath3 scalar doublet of the sm .",
    "there are several ways to do this , as discussed comprehensively in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the canonical approach ,",
    "a higgs triplet is used to break @xmath2 at a large scale , and @xmath11 gets a large majorana mass .",
    "a higgs bidoublet is then added to break @xmath3 , and all fermions obtain dirac masses , with @xmath12 getting a small seesaw mass . in this scenario ,",
    "the @xmath2 breaking scale is presumably beyond the reach of present accelerators , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "even if we try to lower this scale , the canonical model has severe difficulties with flavor - changing neutral currents , in contradiction with what is experimentally observed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to elaborate on a simple alternative  @xcite , where the @xmath2 breaking scale may be lowered to 1 tev , using the inverse seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "we choose a higgs sector which contains only one @xmath0 bidoublet and one @xmath2 doublet [ but no @xmath3 doublet ] .",
    "of course , flavor - changing neutral higgs couplings are still unavoidable . however , as we show in this paper , a scenario exists where they are sufficiently suppressed . since the @xmath2 charged - current mixing matrix is unknown , we consider two scenarios , where it is given either by @xmath4 ( scenario i ) or @xmath5 ( scenario ii ) . we consider the bounds on the corresponding scalar particle masses from @xmath6 and @xmath7 mixing , as well as @xmath8",
    "we find that , whereas in scenario i , they are of order 10 tev , as in other left - right models , they may be well below 1 tev in scenario ii , thus allowing them to be within reach of detection at the forthcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the fermion content of the minimal @xmath13 gauge model is well - known , i.e. @xmath14 where the @xmath15 charge is normalized to @xmath16 so that the electric charge is given by @xmath17 . here",
    "a neutral fermion singlet @xmath18 is also added per family , which will have important implications for the neutrino masses , as shown below .    to obtain masses for the quarks and leptons ,",
    "a higgs bidoublet @xmath19 is needed . in a nonsupersymmetric model , which is being considered here , the dual of @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21",
    "must also be used . to break @xmath22 to @xmath23 , an @xmath2 higgs doublet @xmath24",
    "is added , which also links @xmath25 with @xmath26 to form a dirac mass @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath26 is a gauge singlet , it is also allowed to have a majorana mass @xmath28 ; hence the @xmath29 neutrino mass matrix spanning @xmath30 is of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the usual dirac mass linking @xmath33 to @xmath11 through @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "a quick look at the above shows clearly that if @xmath36 , then lepton number is conserved with a linear combination of @xmath12 and @xmath26 forming a dirac fermion with @xmath11 , and the orthogonal combination is exactly massless .",
    "this means that it is natural for @xmath28 to be small , thereby triggering the inverse seesaw mechanism , resulting in @xmath37 note that there is no entry in eq .",
    "( 7 ) linking @xmath12 and @xmath26 because the @xmath3 higgs doublet is absent .",
    "this is important for the validity of eq .",
    "( 8) . instead of the canonical seesaw formula @xmath38 , which is small if @xmath27 is large , eq .",
    "( 8) lets @xmath39 be small if @xmath28 is small , even if @xmath27 is not too large .",
    "thus the inverse seesaw mechanism is suitable for bringing down the scale of @xmath2 breaking to 1 tev , with verifiable phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "note also that the mixing of @xmath12 with @xmath26 is of order @xmath40 which may now be nonnegligible and results in deviations from unitarity @xcite of the neutrino mixing matrix .      the most general higgs potential consisting of @xmath41 , @xmath20 , and @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 ^ 2 + { 1 \\over 2 } \\lambda_2 tr(\\phi^\\dagger \\phi \\phi^\\dagger \\phi ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { 1 \\over 8 } \\lambda_3 \\ { [ tr(\\phi^\\dagger \\tilde \\phi)]^2 + [ tr(\\tilde{\\phi}^\\dagger \\phi)]^2 \\ } + { 1 \\over 2 } \\lambda_4 [ tr(\\phi^\\dagger \\phi)][tr(\\phi^\\dagger \\tilde \\phi + \\tilde{\\phi}^\\dagger",

    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then the minimum of @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 satisfy @xmath50 @xmath51 + v_2 ( \\mu^2 + f_3 v_r^2 + \\lambda_4 v_2 ^ 2 ) = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath52 + v_1 ( \\mu^2 + f_3 v_r^2 + \\lambda_4 v_1 ^ 2 ) = 0.\\ ] ] a solution exists where @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 with @xmath55 fine tuning is of course unavoidable . in the limit @xmath56 , the physical higgs bosons are @xmath57 and @xmath58 with masses squared @xmath59 and three linear combinations of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , with mass - squared matrix @xmath63      the structure of the scalar sector leads in general to both @xmath64 and @xmath65 mixing .",
    "the former vanishes in the limit @xmath66 and so will be suppressed for the above choice of vacuum expecation values .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath67 mixing term is proportional to @xmath68 , which is unacceptably large . to cancel this contribution ,",
    "a simple possibility is to add a higgs bidoublet @xmath69 with vacuum expectation value @xmath70 . in that case , the choice @xmath71 ( for @xmath72 ) will lead to zero mixing at tree level ; details are given in the appendix . note that @xmath73 will not affect the @xmath74 parameter ( at tree level ) in precision electroweak measurements , nor will it contribute to quark or lepton masses .",
    "in particular , it does not link @xmath12 with @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , otherwise the inverse seesaw mechanism would be invalidated .",
    "the present experimental limits on @xmath75 and @xmath76 are respectively 715 and 860 gev .",
    "since both @xmath20 and @xmath77 couple to the quarks and leptons , flavor - changing interactions through the exchange of neutral higgs scalars are unavoidable . the question is whether they can be suppressed @xcite . consider the yukawa terms @xmath78 in the limit @xmath56 , both @xmath79 and @xmath80 quark masses come from only @xmath81 .",
    "hence @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are unitary matrices , with @xmath85 being the quark mixing matrix for the known left - handed charged currents and that for their unknown right - handed counterparts .",
    "this means that in the basis of quark mass eigenstates , the structure of flavor - changing neutral currents through scalar exchange is determined , i.e. @xmath86 for the @xmath79 quarks , and @xmath87 for the @xmath80 quarks .",
    "hence @xmath60 behaves as the sm higgs boson , and at tree level , all flavor - changing effects come from @xmath88 , whereas in one loop , there are also contributions from @xmath89 .",
    "note that for @xmath90 , this electroweak doublet has the common mass of @xmath91 .    in the lepton sector , the analog of @xmath92 is unknown because the neutrino mass matrix depends on @xmath32 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , we could choose @xmath32 to be diagonal in the @xmath93 basis and still have the freedom to obtain the observed neutrino mixing matrix from @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in that case",
    ", @xmath88 would have no flavor - changing leptonic interactions .",
    "we now apply eq .",
    "( 22 ) to @xmath6 and @xmath7 mixing . in the two scenarios",
    "i and ii considered for the @xmath94 matrix mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath88 couplings are of the form : @xmath95    we use the formulae presented in ref .",
    "the mass difference of a neutral meson and its antiparticle is written in terms of its sm and other contributions : @xmath96 where @xmath97 , and @xmath98 denotes the sm ( one - loop ) contribution , and @xmath99 is everything else . in our case ,",
    "the latter comes from the flavor - changing @xmath100 couplings .",
    "the resulting expression for the mass difference is then given by @xmath101\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath102 includes strong - interaction effects , and the coefficients @xmath103 include next - to - leading qcd corrections , while the functions @xmath104 denote the wilson coefficients of the ope expansion for the relevant hadronic matrix elements .",
    "let us consider first case ( i ) of our model , i.e. @xmath4 . here the wilson coefficients @xmath105 are equal : @xmath106,\\ ] ] and suppressed because the mass difference between @xmath62 and @xmath58 is small compared to their sum , whereas @xmath107 is of the form : @xmath108,\\ ] ] which has no such suppression . in case ( i ) , the various @xmath109 s in each system are also the same : @xmath110 , where @xmath111 we have also assumed for simplicity that all the @xmath92 entries are real .",
    "obviously there are large contributions coming from those terms proportional to @xmath112 or @xmath113 . however , there is also a natural suppression for the @xmath114 and @xmath115 wilson coefficients , because their contributions are proportional to the effective @xmath116 propagator , i.e. @xmath117 . whereas @xmath118 is a mass eigenstate , @xmath119 is not , but if @xmath120 and @xmath121 are small in eq .",
    "( [ m_scalar ] ) , then it is approximately so , and their combined contribution for @xmath90 is naturally suppressed , i.e. @xmath122 this suppression persists even if @xmath120 and @xmath121 are not neglected .",
    "we simply replace @xmath123 by @xmath124 this feature of our model would allow @xmath48 to be at the tev scale , without running into conflict with present data on @xmath6 and @xmath7 mixing as far as @xmath114 and @xmath115 are concerned . unfortunately , this suppression does not work for @xmath125 , which is proportional to @xmath126 .",
    "however , as we show below in case ( ii ) , the @xmath125 coefficients are further suppressed by light quark masses in the @xmath109 s , which allows @xmath88 to be lighter than 1 tev .    in case ( ii ) , i.e. @xmath127 , the @xmath109 values are related by @xmath128 , with @xmath129 from the above , it is clear that whereas @xmath125 is not suppressed by eq .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) , it is much smaller than what it is in case ( i ) , because of the smallness of @xmath130 .    as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are large theoretical uncertainties associated with these expressions . to make an estimate",
    ", we simply require the absolute value of the contribution of new physics to be less than the corresponding experimental value . in",
    "what follows we shall obtain bounds for the combination of parameters : @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "let us define : @xmath133 and @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the approximate mass of @xmath136 or @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is a meassure of the splitting between their squared masses .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ wilsona ] ) and ( [ wilsonb ] ) , we obtain the following general expression : @xmath139   \\frac{p^{sll}_1 \\delta^2 } { m^4_2 }   = \\frac { 3 } { 8 s_x } \\delta m_{x}^{exp}.\\ ] ] for the @xmath6 system , @xmath140 , with @xmath141 mev , @xmath142 mev , @xmath143 and @xmath144 . at the scale @xmath145 gev , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 mev .",
    "notice that in case ( i ) , both @xmath149 and @xmath150 dominate over the @xmath151 and @xmath152 contributions .",
    "threfore the resulting bound is not sensitive to the parameter @xmath153 , and the bound on @xmath135 is given by @xmath154 for the @xmath7 systems , we take the corresponding parameters from the particle data group  @xcite , so that for @xmath155 : @xmath156 these results are in agreement with @xcite .    in case ( ii ) , if we take @xmath157 ( i.e. only the @xmath158 contribution ) , we obtain a much smaller bound for the @xmath159 system , i.e. @xmath160 tev . however , for the @xmath161 , and @xmath162 systems , the same procedure yields the bounds @xmath163 gev , respectively .",
    "thus for the @xmath161 system , it seems more appropriate to consider @xmath164 , in which case the bound becomes : @xmath165 tev .      to evaluate the contribution of @xmath89 to @xmath8 , we consider the relevant terms in eq .",
    "( 22 ) . for case ( i ) , i.e. @xmath4 , the important ones are @xmath166 for case",
    "( ii ) , i.e. @xmath5 , they are @xmath167 the sm contribution ( from @xmath168 exchange ) is of the form @xmath169 which is classified  @xcite as @xmath170 . using the above interactions ,",
    "there is only one such contribution coming from @xmath88 exchange , i.e. @xmath171 and @xmath172 , which is proportional to @xmath173 in both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , assuming that @xmath174 , which is of course a very good approximation .",
    "in contrast to the usual two - higgs - doublet model , the @xmath175 contribution is suppressed here because it is proportional to @xmath176 . as for @xmath177 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath178 , both @xmath88 and @xmath175 have contributions proportional to @xmath173 , but since the @xmath8 rate is proportional to @xmath179 the latter can be safely ignored",
    ". using ref .",
