    ", cosmological observations have also given us a glimpse into the universe s dark sector .",
    "the observation of the accelerated expansion of the universe is a landmark discovery in cosmology @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of the expansion of the universe is most commonly explained by a framework which suggests that our universe is dominated by a ` dark energy ' field with negative pressure .",
    "the dark energy is similar to the cosmological constant ( @xmath8 ) in einstein s theory of general relativity @xcite . the @xmath8cdm - gr model which proposed",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe is in consonance with probes such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite .",
    "the observation that the expansion of the universe is accelerating can also pertain to the possibility of ` dark gravity ' @xcite , which suggests that general relativity is incorrect on the largest scales and is a limit of a more complete theory of gravity .",
    "such a possibility gives scope to the explanation of the accelerated expansion of the universe by frameworks which try to reproduce cosmological observations by modifying the form of the equations of gr .",
    "the cause for the acceleration in the expansion of the universe remains a mystery and one can not settle on a preferred candidate to explain the measurement of the expansion history _",
    "h(z ) _ from spectroscopic surveys and probes like type ia supernova and bao since modified theories of gravity @xcite and theories based on dark energy",
    "explain the observations equally well .",
    "in other words , the measurement of the expansion rate alone will not be able to distinguish between a model based on dark energy and modified theories of gravity .",
    "one way of resolving this conundrum lies in the investigation of the growth rate of structure inside the universe @xcite .",
    "the growth rate of structure in the universe is decided by the competing effects of the gravitational collapse of density fluctuations , which accelerate their growth and the expansion rate , which inhibits it .",
    "since the theory of general relativity gives us a relation between the growth rate of cosmological structure and the expansion history of the universe , measurements of the growth rate give us a handle on the underlying theory of gravity .",
    "in cosmological observations , the positions of galaxies are mapped by redshift , which correspond to the true distance according to the hubble law .",
    "probes which look at the growth of structure in the universe also include the peculiar velocities of galaxies .",
    "the observed redshift ( _ z _ ) is , in fact , a sum of the hubble recession velocity and the peculiar velocity caused by gravitational dynamics .",
    "components from the peculiar velocities , which are deviations of galaxies velocity from pure hubble flow , combine with components from the hubble flow to give rise to distortions in the reconstructed spatial distribution of the observed objects .",
    "the ensuing distortions manifest themselves as anisotropy in the distribution of objects and are caused in the radial direction in the redshift space @xcite .",
    "these distortions are referred to as ` redshift space distortions ' ( rsd ) .",
    "redshift space distortions can be used to reveal information about the motion of galaxies and underlying matter distribution in the universe .",
    "the distinctive features of rsd are revealed in the two - point correlation statistics of galaxy distributions which are obtained as functions of variables representing distances parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight(@xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively ) . in small spatial scales where galaxies with high velocities are dominant",
    ", rsd is manifested as elongation in redshift space maps with an axis of elongation pointing towards the observer ( i.e. , along @xmath9 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as the `` fingers of god '' effect @xcite . on larger scales ,",
    "one observes the `` kaiser effect '' where coherent peculiar velocities cause an apparent contraction of structure along the line of sight in redshift space . as a result",
    ", we see two distinct effects , @xmath11 the non - linear and the linear effects due to small - scale elongation and large scale flattening in redshift scale maps .",
    "measurement of the growth rate of structure from rsd is intricate . in 1987 ,",
    "nick kaiser @xcite tried to tackle this problem by introducing a prescription which discusses the redshift space power spectrum by modifying the linear theory of large scale structure . in his landmark work , kaiser was able to relate the power spectrum in redshift space @xmath12 and it s counterpart in real space @xmath13 by the following relation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 corresponds to the cosine of the angle between @xmath16 and the line of sight and @xmath17 is the linear distortion parameter .",
    "here , @xmath18 is the mass density parameter and @xmath19 denotes the linear bias parameter .",
    "further extension of this formalism to non - linear scales using ideas of the `` streaming model '' was suggested in @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the factor @xmath20 relates peculiar velocities to density fluctuations .",
    "the real space counterpart of the fourier space formalism given by kaiser was introduced by @xcite .",
    "extensions of the linear model , called the `` dispersion model '' have been used to determine the growth rate from the two point galaxy correlation function @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "however , measurements of the growth rate parameter from the dispersion model have been found to introduce systematic errors in the results @xcite .",
    "an important breakthrough in the dispersion model was effected by taruya in 2010 @xcite when he proposed a new model of redshift space distortion which studied correction factors arising from the non - linear coupling between velocity and density fields .",

    "we discuss the concept of two point galaxy correlation functions in section  [ sec:2pcorr ] .",
    "the lowest order in the expansion of the matter correlation function , @xmath25 returns the zeldovich approximation .",
    "we introduce details of the concept of multipoles , i.e. the monopole(@xmath26 ) and the quadrupole ( @xmath27 ) in equation  [ eqn : multipoleeqn ] . the monopole and the quadrupole from clpt agree well with the results of @xmath28-body simulations till small scales ( @xmath29 @xmath30mpc ) . also , the results from clpt tally with the results from the lagrangian resummation theory ( lrt ) by matsubarra @xcite on large scales . although clpt has been shown to perform better than lrt and the linear theory in the modeling of multipoles ,",
    "the desire to model even smaller scales effectively necessitates better performance from the theory , especially with regard to the performance of the quadrupole on smaller scales .      to overcome the deficiencies in the predictions of the linear theory one needs to consider the non - linear mapping between real space and redshift space and the non - linearty of the halo pairwise velocities .",
    "the gaussian streaming model ( gsm ) attempts to non - perturbatively model the non - linear mapping between real space and redshift space positions in halo redshift - space correlation functions on quasilinear scales ( @xmath31 @xmath32mpc ) @xcite . in the gaussian streaming model ,",

    "however , the fingers of god effect is expected to affect the observations at scales below @xmath36 @xmath30mpc .",
    "the multipoles @xmath37 obtained from gsm are significantly more enhanced on quasi - linear scales when compared to the multipoles obtained from the linear theory .",
    "the level of accuracy of the results obtained from gsm leads to it being a desirable candidate for the analysis of two point correlation functions . in order to further improve the estimation of the multipoles from clpt ,",
    "the velocity statistics and the correlation function from clpt are combined with the formalism of gsm to enhance the accuracy of the monopoles and quadrupoles predicted by the theory @xcite .",

    "@xcite use an analysis based on wedges from anisotropic power spectrum in their investigation of the boss dr12 galaxy data .",
    "we use the multi - dark patchy ( md - p ) mock catalogs @xcite as an essential statistical tool and as a precursor to the analysis of the sdss iii dr12 combined galaxy dataset .",
    "these mock catalogs require the generation of accurate reference catalogs . for these md - p mock catalogs ,",
    "the reference catalogs are extracted from one of the bigmultidark cosmological n - body simulations @xcite which uses gadget-2 @xcite with 3840@xmath80 particles in a volume of @xmath81mpc@xmath82 .",
    "these simulations are based on a @xmath8cdm cosmology of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    in a manner akin to the division of the boss dr12 data into redshift bins , the md - p mock catalogs that we use",
