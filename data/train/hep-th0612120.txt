    "the model @xcite , appears as the simplest case in a family of homogeneous generalisations for the model@xcite .",
    "it is an integrable @xmath0 dimensional field theory with an internal @xmath1 degree of freedom .",
    "it is described by a lagrangian of the form [ eq : csglagr2 ] l_csg = - m^2 u u^ *   , where @xmath2 is a complex field and @xmath3 is a real coupling constant .",
    "the model accepts soliton @xcite and breather solutions@xcite which are non topological in nature .",
    "the model is recovered only in the chargeless limit , in which solutions become topological objects .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we studied the classical theory in the bulk and on a half line .",
    "the behaviour of various solutions and their interaction with the boundary was analysed . through the construction of conserved currents we managed to obtain a general boundary condition that preserves integrability [ eq : csgintbc ]",
    "u = -c u & , & = -c u , where both expressions are evaluated at @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a real parameter .",
    "the full lagrangian on a half line is [ eq : csglagr2 ] l_csg = ^0_-dx(- m^2 u u^ * ) + _",
    "x=0  . in this paper , we shall aim to extend our study of the model on the half - line to the quantum regime .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the second section we review the most important results for the quantum theory in the bulk .    in the third section",
    "we shall use the semi - classical stationary - phase approach which is the field theory analogue of the wkb method of quantum mechanics .",
    "a generalised version of bohr - sommerfeld quantisation , following the method of dashen , hasslacher and neveu @xcite will be used to obtain the semi - classical spectrum of boundary states and their first order corrections . as we shall see , these corrections induce a finite renormalisation of both the bulk and boundary coupling constants .",
    "the former is consistent with results from the bulk case .    following that , the bootstrap programme devised by ghoshal and zamolodchikov @xcite will be used to construct the quantum reflection factors of particles and solitons scattering off the boundary .",
    "the results of delius and gandenberger @xcite are adapted to find to postulate a reflection factor which is consistent with the bulk scattering matrix found by dorey and hollowood @xcite , crossing , unitarity and semi - classical results .",
    "in particular , the use of carefully chosen cdd factors furnishes these factors with poles consistent with the existence of the boundary - bound states , found in the previous section . that this can be done consistently provides some evidence in favour of our conjecture .",
    "the paper finishes with a few general remarks about the results of the quantum case including a brief discussion about the poles in the bootstrap method and the necessary conditions in order for them to lie within the physical strip .",
    "the model as a quantum field theory in the bulk was studied relatively soon after the model s introduction . the classical treatment which showed the theory to be completely integrable and to possess soliton solutions carrying a @xmath1 charge , prompted researchers to look into the quantum case in the hope that the nice features of the model persisted in this limit too .",
    "the investigation of the quantum case began with the work of de vega and maillet @xcite in which they showed that the is factorisable at tree level .",
    "the model remains integrable and continues to accept soliton solutions in the quantum case .",
    "provided that a specific counterterm which depends on the field is added to the lagrangian , the is also factorisable at one - loop level . in their following paper @xcite they used the inverse scattering method to obtain the classical two - soliton solution and the spectrum of states using the semi - classical methods by dashen , hasslacher and neveu @xcite .",
    "the two - loop order case was studied by bonneau in @xcite who , continuing down the path of de vega and maillet , showed that the theory is non - renormalisable unless a finite number of counterterms ( quantum corrections ) are added .    after a gap of almost ten years",
    "the quantum case was revisited by dorey and hollowood @xcite in the light of the theory emerging as a gauged wzw model @xcite . with the semi - classical results of de vega and maillet as a guide , they proposed an exact based on the demands of the bootstrap programme .",
    "we begin our review with the general form of a single soliton solution [ eq : usoliton ] u = , where @xmath6 is a real parameter associated with the @xmath1 charge , and @xmath7 the rapidity of the solution . from the expressions for the energy and charge [ eq : bulkenergy ] e = + m^2 u &  ,  & q = i dx   , we easily obtain for the single soliton case [ eq : mq ] e= ( a ) ( ) &  ,  & q = ( - a )  . in their paper dorey and",
    "hollowood argued that it is necessary to only consider specific values for the coupling constant .",
    "specifically they argued that the only acceptable values are ^2 = & , & k>1  , where @xmath8 is an integer .",
    "this agrees with the wzw interpretation of the theory where @xmath8 corresponds to the level of the @xmath9 coset model . with this constraint",
    "their proposed reproduces the semi - classical spectrum of states derived by de vega and maillet .",
    "in addition they proposed that the charge is conserved if it is defined modulo @xmath8 . in the following",
    ", we shall use @xmath8 instead of the coupling constant @xmath3 for reasons of simplicity .",
    "the quantum spectrum can be found by using the bohr - sommerfeld quantisation rule s(u ) + e(u ) = 2 n  & , & n   , where @xmath10 is the action functional , @xmath11 the energy and @xmath12 the period of the solution @xmath2 .",
    "no topological distinction exists between the vacuum and the soliton sector , and thelowest - charge soliton may be regarded as the the basic particle of the csg theory .",
    "the static one - soliton solution is [ eq : staticsoliton ] u_static =   .",
    "this solution is not time - independent .",
    "it does not translate in the @xmath13 direction but oscillates in a breather - like fashion . as pointed out by ventura and marques @xcite , and montonen @xcite ,",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld quantisation is equal to charge quantisation for scalar field theories enjoying a global @xmath1 symmetry . for the csg case the only time dependence for the soliton solution in the rest frame",
    "is restricted to the phase i.e. @xmath14 does not depend on time .",
    "it is easy to show that for the static one - soliton s(u ) + e(u ) = 2 q  , which in turn implies q = n .",
    "this corresponds to a tower of states with ever increasing charge .",
    "however in the classical case the charge is a periodic function . in the theory @xmath6",
    "appears only in trigonometric forms , and therefore should be considered as an angle variable .",
    "this indicates that the formula for @xmath15 which has previously appeared in the literature is only true for a certain region , namely @xmath16 . if one plots @xmath15 as a function of @xmath6 the result is a periodic pattern ( fig . [ fig : qsoliton ] ) . to avoid confusion",
    "we shall consider @xmath6 to lay in the region @xmath17 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "as suggested by dorey and hollowood the charge should be defined modulo @xmath8 which leads to a finite spectrum depending on @xmath8 q = & 1 , 2 , ... , &   k   , + q = & 1 , 2 , ... , , &   k    . from the classical expression for the charge ( [ eq : bulkenergy ] ) we have q = ( - a )  .",
    "the quantisation of the charge is in fact the quantisation of @xmath6 2 q = 2 n a = ( -n )  . through the quantisation of the charge parameter , the energy spectrum m = m ( a )  ,",
    "is also obtained m ( q ) = |  ( ) |  .",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld quantisation provides us only with the quantum spectrum up to leading order . according to de vega and maillet the next order corrections",
    "is achieved by a simple renormalisation of the coupling constant ^2 _",
    "r^2 =  . or equivalently [ renormalisation ] k k_r = k -1  . at this level",
    "an may be written down that reproduces the semi - classical spectrum to leading order . in their paper dorey and hollowood",
    "first presented a minimal choice for the meson - soliton scattering matrix s_1q = f_q-1()f_q+1 ( )  . which reproduced the semi - classical behaviour and agreed with the results of devega and maillet",
    "moreover , through this they confirmed that the meson in the csg theory can be identified with the @xmath18 soliton .",
    "the function @xmath19 is defined as [ eq : ffactor ] f_q ( ) = .",
    "@xmath10-matrices constructed from products of the @xmath19 automatically satisfy unitarity and analyticity constraints . with the above result as a starting point they proposed the following for arbitrary charge [ eq : smatrix ] s_q_1q_2 = f_q_1-q_2 ^2 f_q_1+q_2 , which satisfies all the familiar restrictions and has the correct pole structure .",
    "in addition they pointed out that this is exactly the minimal associated with the lie algebra @xmath20 and conjectured that for the specific choices of the coupling this should be exact .    with the general form of the the review of the bulk case is concluded .",
    "more details on the above results may be found in the relevant papers .",
    "nevertheless , this presentation contain all the ingredients needed to examine the half - line case .",
    "in this section we shall attempt to build the complete spectrum of quantum boundary - bound states for the model on a half line .",
    "the fact that the model possesses exact periodic solutions bound to the boundary makes the stationary - phase method a suitable candidate for their quantisation .",
    "the method is based on the work of dashen , hasslacher and neveu @xcite for the semi - classical quantisation of the model . in this case",
    "it appears as a generalised version of the bohr - sommerfeld quantisation rule s_qu - t = 2 n  , where @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is related to the stability angles of the stationary phase approach and produces the first order quantum corrections to the classical action .",
    "we shall use the ordinary quantisation condition for the classical action @xmath23 and then we shall calculate the quantum corrections factor [ eq : quantumcorrection ] = ( - t )  .    before embarking on quantisation",
    ", we will recall a few of the classical results about the boundary spectrum from @xcite .",
    "the energy of the half - line theory is given by e=_-^0 -2c for a given value of @xmath5 , the lowest energy configuration corresponds to the vacuum @xmath24 .",
    "linearising the equations of motion and the boundary conditions ( [ eq : csgintbc ] ) one calculates the particle reflection coefficient can be found to be [ eq : classicalref ] k(k)= where @xmath8 is the momentum of the particle . for @xmath25 , one can show that the pole corresponds to a normalisable but in time exponentially growing perturbative mode showing that the vacuum is an unstable configuration .",
    "for @xmath5 in this range , the boundary can emit a real soliton which effectively swaps the sign of @xmath5 so that ultimately the classical field configuration returns to @xmath24 , but now with @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    ", it is possible to construct a classical excited boundary state by taking @xmath28 to be a static soliton solution of the form in ( [ eq : staticsoliton ] ) , provided that the parameters are chosen to obey the equation [ eq : solitonbc ] c= there are other more complicated boundary states based on multi - soliton solutions such as breathers @xcite , but a thorough analysis of these is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the boundary term of ( [ eq : csglagr2 ] ) preserves the @xmath1 charge as it only depends on mod(@xmath2 ) .",
    "the theory remains @xmath1 invariant and therefore the bohr - sommerfeld quantisation is equivalent to charge quantisation on the half line case as it was for the bulk .",
    "the quantisation condition for the classical action reads s_cl[u_cl ] + e_cl[u_cl ] t = 2q = 2 n  . with @xmath29 the static one soliton solution of ( [ eq : staticsoliton ] ) with parameters chosen to satisfy ( [ eq : solitonbc ] ) .",
    "it is a periodic solution with period @xmath30 exhibiting a breather - like behaviour .",
    "it provides the perfect starting point as the simplest boundary bound state of the classical theory .",
    "the position of the centre of mass will determine the charge of the bound state as a fraction of the soliton charge in the bulk .",
    "we can calculate the charge of the static soliton through the expression [ eq : q2 ] q = - i _",
    "dx . note that this charge is conserved without the need to add a term at the boundary .",
    "this time however the integration takes place on the half line and finally yields [ eq : chargeboundary ] q = ( - b - a )  .",
    "the charge now depends on the boundary parameter @xmath31 , which enters the calculation through the position of the centre of mass . as a check that this formula is correct , we can set @xmath32 which implies that we have the neumann boundary condition @xmath33 , thus placing the soliton at exactly @xmath4 .",
    "the charge is then exactly half of the equivalent charge of the soliton in the bulk ( [ eq : mq ] ) as expected .",
    "the quantisation condition now reads [ eq : quant1 ] q = ( - b - a ) = n  , or in terms of the charge parameter a = - b -  .",
    "the quantisation of @xmath6 provides us with the first approximation of the semi - classical spectrum e_n = ( a ) = ( - b - )  .",
    "having a general formula for the energy , it is useful to calculate the energy difference between two adjacent states .",
    "we shall use this in the following section where we shall compare it with the corresponding bootstrap result . for reasons of simplicity",
    ", we shall assume that the values of the parameters are such that the cosine is positive for both states as is their difference so that we can ignore any modulus appearing .",
    "the energy difference is then written e_n+1 - e_n = ( ( - b - ) - ( - b - ) )  , which after some manipulation simplifies to [ eq : energydifference ] e_n+1 - e_n = ( - ) ( - + b ) )  .",
    "we shall return to this result at the end of the next section , after we have obtained a relevant expression from the bootstrap programme .",
    "having obtained the leading order quantisation of the boundary spectrum , we calculate the first - order correction to this .",
    "the step consists of calculating the quantity @xmath22 [ eq : delta ] = - s_ct + _",
    "i=0^   v_i  , where @xmath34 are the stability angles and @xmath35 suitably selected counter terms to cancel any arising infinities .",
    "we shall first calculate the sum over the stability angles , while the counter terms will be introduced later . in order to obtain all possible states",
    "one has to consider the theory in a box .",
    "the theory is already bounded on the right from the original boundary , therefore another boundary should be introduced restricting the system in the finite volume @xmath36 $ ] . using periodic boundary conditions will force all energy levels to become discrete .",
    "we can afterwards take the limit @xmath37 to recover the original system .",
    "the most appropriate choice would be dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath24 , which reproduce the correct behaviour of @xmath2 at infinity .",
    "the stability angles are obtained by solving the linearised stability equation about a given classical solution . in our case",
    "we perturb around the static one - soliton solution .",
    "once the solutions @xmath38 for the stability equation are found then the stability angles can be calculated from periodicity demands [ eq : stabilityangles ] _",
    "i(x , t+t ) = e^i v_i _ i(x , t )  , instead of solving directly the stability equation we can follow the method of corrigan and delius to calculate the sum of the stability angles through the reflection factors .",
    "we begin with the classical two - soliton solution of the csg model which satisfies the stability equation . by fixing the free parameters we can make one of the solitons @xmath39 static by taking @xmath40 and the other @xmath41 very small by taking the charge parameter @xmath42 close to zero .",
    "effectively we are left with a small perturbation around a static one - soliton background .",
    "this is exactly the same method that dashen , hasslacher and neveu followed to calculate the stability angles of the sine - gordon model . at infinity",
    "the static soliton is practically zero whilst the perturbation appears as plane waves ( x , t ) = e^-it ( e^i k_s x + r_s e^-i k_s x )  .",
    "the reflection factor is found to be r_s = -   , where we have set @xmath43 without loss of generality .",
    "the rapidity @xmath7 which has been used is related to the momentum through @xmath44 . the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath45 are the familiar charge and boundary parameters . from the above expression for @xmath38 and ( [ eq : stabilityangles ] ) we can substitute = _",
    "i v_i = _ i _",
    "i  , where @xmath46 and the counter terms have been neglected . placing the system in a box allows for discrete values of @xmath8",
    "which should not be confused with the coupling constant . from @xmath22",
    "we must now subtract the vacuum contributions [ eq : delta2 ] = _ i -  . from the dirichlet boundary conditions we can obtain the following equation relating the discrete momenta with the reflection factors e^- 2 i k_s l =   . a similar equation exists for the fluctuations around the vacuum e^- 2 i k_0 l= -  . using the same argument as corrigan and delius",
    ", we can define a function @xmath47 such that for large @xmath8 we may write [ eq : ks ] k _ s = k_0 +  , where the index @xmath48 has been suppressed .",
    "this is possible since in the limit @xmath49 and taking into account the general quantisation condition of ( [ eq : quant1 ] ) , both reflection factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 are equal .",
    "through the difference @xmath52 a function @xmath53 may be defined using the ratio of the corresponding reflection factors e^-2i ( ) = -  .",
    "we can now calculate @xmath22 in terms of @xmath54 .",
    "we can substitute ( [ eq : ks ] ) in ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) and then expand the expression in terms of @xmath55 . keeping only the leading term of the expansion we end up with ~ _",
    "i  , which in the limit @xmath56 can be substitute with the integral form = _ 0^= dk  ( k )  .",
    "the calculation is greatly simplified if we change variables to @xmath7 = _ 0^+ d ( ) ( )  .",
    "the integral is divergent but we can introduce specially chosen counter - terms to obtain a finite result .",
    "we begin with an integration by parts [ eq : delta1 ] = ( _ 0^+ - _ 0^+ ( ) )  .",
    "the first term is not divergent since the function @xmath54 approaches zero ( through the quantisation condition ) as @xmath7 goes to infinity . in this limit",
    "the combination @xmath57 is zero .",
    "in addition , @xmath58 so the first term in ( [ eq : delta1 ] ) vanishes .",
    "the second term is however divergent and counter terms have to be introduced to cancel infinities .",
    "the latter appear in the same fashion as the logarithmic divergencies in the bulk which are tackled through normal ordering . with some straightforward manipulation the derivative term yields = -+  .",
    "the two terms are almost identical and both divergent .",
    "a logical choice of counter - terms seems to be -+  , where the first removes the divergence associated with the boundary and the second with the one in the bulk .",
    "the complete expression to be calculated is now & = & - _ 0^+d ( ) + &  & ( - - + ) , which finally yields = ( -(a ) + ( b ) + b ( b ) + ( b ) - a ( a ) - ( a ) )  .",
    "having determined the form of @xmath22 we are now in a position to calculate the corrections to the classical bohr - sommerfeld rule .",
    "the expression of @xmath22 depends on the period @xmath30 through the charge parameter @xmath6 ( a ) =  .",
    "the correction term of ( [ eq : quantumcorrection ] ) is easily calculated - t = - a -  .",
    "with all the necessary parts calculated , the generalised bohr - sommerfeld quantisation condition finally reads k_r ( - b_r - a ) = 2 n  , where k_r = k-1 & , & b_r =  .",
    "the form of the new quantisation condition is exactly the same as the first approximation of ( [ eq : quant1 ] ) , only with a redefinition for the boundary and coupling constants .",
    "the shift in the coupling constant is to be expected . in the bulk case",
    "the first order corrections amount to a simple shift in @xmath8 ( [ renormalisation ] ) as pointed by de vega and maillet @xcite .",
    "our result is consistent with this .",
    "in addition to @xmath8 , the boundary constant has to be renormalised as well . it is not clear why this renormalisation is needed or whether it should appear at all . in a paper examining the closely related @xmath20 theory , penati and",
    "zanon @xcite argued that renormalisation of boundary parameters has to be introduced in certain models to ensure integrability at the quantum level .",
    "the renormalisation of the coupling constant and its significance remains one of the open questions for the quantum csg theory .",
    "in the previous section we constructed the quantum spectrum using the semi - classical stationary - phase method .",
    "although the results are not exact , they provide us with an accurate picture of the set of states .",
    "the same spectrum can be obtained using the completely different approach of the bootstrap method .",
    "it is based on the pioneering work of cherednik @xcite , ghoshal and zamolodchickov @xcite , and fring and kberle @xcite . this way we shall be able to compare and compliment the results to acquire an even more accurate spectrum . the idea behind this method is to construct the reflection factors through the boundary bootstrap relation , and through the poles therein to identify boundary bound states .",
    "the process is analogue to the bulk case where the existence of bound states is indicated by poles found in the @xmath10-matrix .",
    "nevertheless there are quite a lot of drawbacks in this process .",
    "first of all in order to begin we need the quantum reflection factor for the particle of the theory .",
    "this can not be obtained through any consistent procedure .",
    "although the principles of analyticity , unitarity and crossing symmetry along with the boundary yang - baxter equation restrict the form of the reflection factor enough , it is impossible to pin it down completely .",
    "it is therefore a matter of  selecting \" the correct reflection factor which should satisfy all constraints whilst introducing a pole corresponding to a boundary bound state .",
    "after carefully deciding on the correct reflection factor for the particle , we are faced with a second problem .",
    "although we are only concerned with poles in the reflection factor which appear on the physical strip ( which in the half line case is @xmath59 $ ] ) , not all of them correspond to boundary bound states .",
    "it is quite difficult to explain the appearance of all the poles which lie within the physical strip and no work until now exists to offer a systematic treatment of poles encountered .",
    "another difficult arises with the determination of the cdd factors in the reflection matrix .",
    "the restrictions imposed on the reflection factor may determine it up to a set of factors , quite like the cdd factors of the @xmath10-matrix .",
    "however the reflection cdd factors which are also restricted by the same constraints , introduce more poles which are also difficult to explain .    considering all the above we shall attempt to construct the quantum boundary - bound state spectrum for the csg theory but our study will be superficial .",
    "it is not our objective to fully explain the quantum structure of the model but rather to verify crudely our semi - classical results .",
    "the detailed explanation of poles in the reflection factors , the determination of a general form for the reflection cdd factors and the comparison of the results with similar theories are quite fascinating problems but are beyond the scope of this paper . in the following section we shall present a suitable form for the quantum reflection factor for the particle of the csg model .",
    "+      we begin our attempt to introduce a suitable reflection matrix @xmath60 for the csg particle with the assumption that it should be made out of @xmath61 factors that were defined in ( [ eq : ffactor ] ) .",
    "it is a natural selection as both the boundary yang - baxter equation and the bootstrap equations relate reflection matrices with the which is expressed only in terms of such functions .",
    "there is another advantage to this choice .",
    "unitarity , real analyticity and @xmath62-periodicity requirements are automatically satisfied if @xmath63 appears as a product of such factors .",
    "some of the most important properties enjoyed by these functions include the following f_q()f_q(-)= 1  , &  f_2q ( 2 ) = - f_q()f_q+k ( )  , &  f_q(+i ) = - f_q+k ( )  .",
    "the first of the above is responsible for the fulfillment of the unitarity requirement .",
    "the remaining demonstrate basic transformations between rapidity and charge and will be used in the bootstrap and crossing symmetry equations .",
    "it should be noted that since there is no degeneracy in the spectrum we expect @xmath63 to be diagonal .",
    "this , in conjunction with a diagonal @xmath10-matrix , renders the boundary yang - baxter equation [ eq : boundaryyangbaxter ] k_a(_a)s_ab(_a+_b ) k_b(_b ) s_ab(_a-_b)= s_ab(_a-_b ) k_b(_b ) s_ab ( _ a+ _ b ) k_a ( _ a )  , trivial . in their paper dorey and hollowood identified the csg particle with the @xmath18 soliton . in this context",
    "the first real constraint for @xmath63 comes from the crossing symmetry relation which for our case is written as [ eq : boundcrossing ] k_1 ( ) k_|1(+ i ) = s_1,1 ( 2 )  , where @xmath64 is the reflection of the antiparticle and @xmath65 is the two particle scattering matrix .",
    "dorey and hollowood noted that the csg is identical to the minimal @xmath20 which in turn can be recovered from the @xmath66 affine toda field theory ( atft ) when the parts involving the coupling constant are omitted .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to build our reflection matrix based on the proposed form for the particle reflection matrix of the boundary @xmath66 atft theory . in their paper delius and gandenberger",
    "@xcite present a general form for the particle reflection matrix of the @xmath66 atft . as in the case",
    "the reflection matrix is a product of two parts , out of which only one depends on the coupling constant .",
    "each part satisfies the bootstrap independently so we can recover a @xmath63-matrix for our model by simply ignoring the coupling dependent pieces .",
    "the block notation implies @xmath67 and shall be used henceforth in parallel with @xmath61 . ignoring the parts involving the coupling constant ,",
    "the remaining factors [ eq : reflectionbase ] k_n = _ c=1^n ( c-1 ) ( c - k ) & , & n=1 .. (k-1 )  , constitute a complete set satisfying the crossing - symmetry condition ( [ eq : boundcrossing ] ) as well as the reflection bootstrap equation [ eq : reflectionbootstrap ] k_c(_c ) = k_a(_a ) k_b(_b ) s_ab(_a+_b )  .",
    "this is not unexpected as both theories share the same minimal .",
    "this however creates a problem as @xmath63 does not contain any poles which can be related to boundary - bound states .",
    "this means that should any additional factors be added by hand to introduce the required poles , they should be added in such a way that they cancel between them in the crossing and bootstrap relations .",
    "this in turn suggests that the new factors are nothing more than cdd factors for the reflection matrix .",
    "placing the poles in the cdd factors simplifies the whole procedure of determining a suitable particle reflection matrix since they satisfy simpler relations .",
    "real analyticity and unitarity conditions once again prompt us to construct our cdd factors out of block functions , so that the former are satisfied automatically . in order for the crossing relation to be satisfied any block factor @xmath68",
    "should be accompanied by the charge conjugate factor @xmath69 .",
    "delius and gandenberger showed for such a combination the bootstrap closes .    now that we have a consistent way of adding factors we need to find where the poles should appear .",
    "we begin with the simple formation of the boundary bound state described in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : boundarybound ] ) . during the process",
    "both energy and charge are conserved .",
    "we begin with the charge conservation . far away from the boundary the soliton ( particle ) behaves as in the theory in the bulk .",
    "its charge is equal to the normal soliton charge @xmath70 .",
    "after the formation of the bound state the charge @xmath71 is given by the formula ( [ eq : chargeboundary ] ) .",
    "equating these yields [ eq : chargeconservation ] ( -a_1)=(-b - a_2 )  .",
    "using the same arguments we can write down an equation describing the conservation of energy [ energyconservation ] 4 m ( a_1 ) ( ) - 2 m(b ) = 2 m ( a_2 )  , where the @xmath72 term is the boundary energy contribution when the field is zero . from ( [ eq : chargeconservation ] ) and ( [ energyconservation ] ) we can determine the rapidity @xmath73 at which the boundary bound state is formed _",
    "n^(0,n ) = i ( n+b ) & & b=  b-  . for the above relation the quantisation condition of ( [ eq : quant1 ] ) was also used . now",
    "that we have determined where the pole should be , we need to express it in block notation .",

    "nevertheless the blocks containing the pole should not be the only components of the cdd factor . on the contrary",
    "we expect the number of cdd factors in @xmath77 to increase as @xmath78 increases towards @xmath79 and then to decrease as it approaches @xmath80 .",

    "we opt for a cdd factor containing only the first pole and its charge conjugate counterpart .",

    "having a general formula about the @xmath78-th pole allows us to write down a recursive relation for the energies of the bound states .",
    "we begin with the energy of the first bound state .",
    "the difference between the first excited boundary state and the non - excited boundary is e_1 - e_0 = a ( _ 0 )  .",

    "the soliton becomes infinitesimally small and the boundary - bound states spectrum become continuous .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief discussion about the poles appearing in the reflection matrix .",

    "this however does not alter any of our results . from ( [ eq : energydifference2 ] ) we can see that @xmath128 or @xmath127 appear in the argument of the cosine so both correspond to the same absolute energy difference between two states .",
    "we used semi - classical method to obtain the boundary spectrum of the csg model .",
    "having incorporated the unitary and crossing constraints , we found that we needed to adjust our simplest guess for the reflection factor of a particle off an unexcited boundary by a cdd factor , in order that the reflection factor in question exhibited a pole corresponding to the lowest bound state of the boundary .",
    "reflection factors for higher charge solitons , and for particles and solitons scattering off excited boundaries were obtained by iterating the reflection bootstrap and boundary bootstrap respectively .",
    "the rest of the excited boundary spectrum could be deduced by analysing the poles in these higher reflection factors , and , perhaps remarkably , it coincides with that obtained by semi - classical methods . the reflection and boundary bootstrap both close because the minimal choice for @xmath77 ( [ eq : reflectionbase ] ) is consistent with our and because the introduced blocks are cdd factors .",
    "one final point to be made is that although we have used for our comparison equations ( [ eq : quant1 ] ) and ( [ eq : energydifference ] ) which correspond to the first approximation in the semi - classical approach , we can extend our results to agree with the first order corrections by simply substituting everywhere @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
