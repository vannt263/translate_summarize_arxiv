    "the subject econophysics is an interdisciplinary research field where the tools of physics are applied to understand the problem of economics .",
    "the term ` econophysics ' was coined by h. eugene stanley in a kolkata conference on statistical physics in @xmath0 .",
    "the research on economics by physicists is not new .",
    "there were many physicists who contributed significantly in the development of economics .",
    "for example daniel bernoulli , who developed utility - based preferences , was a physicist .",
    "similarly irving fisher , who was one of the founders of neoclassical economic theory , was a student of statistical physicist josiah willard gibbs .",
    "also jan tinbergen , who won the first nobel prize in economics , did his ph .",
    "d. in statistical physics in leiden university under paul ehrenfest .",
    "however these physicists ( by training ) eventually left physics and migrated to economics .",
    "the new feature of the developments for the last two decades is that physicists studying the problems of economics or sociology remain in their respective departments and publish their econophysics research results in almost all the major physics journals .    in india ,",
    "works of such interdisciplinary nature are not new .",
    "the indian statistical institute , kolkata , is the one of oldest institutions in india ( founded in 1931 ) .",
    "the main motivation of this research institute was to promote interactions of natural and social sciences ; in particular to advance the role of statistics .",
    "the work on econophysics in india started around 1990 from saha institute nuclear physics , kolkata .",
    "now - a - days many researchers from different universities and institutes from our country are also involved in this research field and international conferences are being organized here on regular basis .    over the last two decades",
    "many papers , books and reviews have been written by the indian scientists in this field .",
    "we will analyze here the statistics of such publications and other endeavors .",
    "to see how the subject grew after introduction of this topic ( term ) in 1995 in scientific community all over the world , we have taken the statistics of the articles having ` econophysics ' term any where in the articles from google scholar site .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows histogram plot of the number of papers posted in google scholar over different years .",
    "the figure clearly indicates that the subject is growing quite fast , starting in around 1995 .",
    "to get an idea about the impact of econophysics research on physics as well as economics , we give in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the count of the papers having the term ` market ' in the titles of a typical statistical physics journal , namely ` physical review e ' ( published by american physical society ) and the number of papers having the term ` physics ' or ` econophysics ' in a typical economics journal ` econometrica ' ( published by econometric society ) for the same period .",
