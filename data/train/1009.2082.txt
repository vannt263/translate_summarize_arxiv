    "the pipe nebula is a massive ( @xmath4  @xmath5 : @xcite ) filamentary ( @xmath015  pc long and @xmath03  pc wide ) dark cloud located in the southern sky @xmath05  apart from the galactic center .",
    "its short distance to the sun ( 145 pc : @xcite ) places this complex in the group of nearby molecular clouds which serve as good laboratories for star formation surveys . despite the large reservoir of mass ,",
    "the pipe nebula molecular cloud is characterized by being apparently quiescent , with a very low star - formation efficiency ( @xmath00.06% for the entire cloud , @xcite ) .",
    "barnard 59 ( b59 ) , located at the northwestern end of the cloud , has formed a small cluster of low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the low global star forming efficiency of the cloud contrasts with that of other nearby molecular clouds such as ophiuchus or taurus , where an important star - formation activity is observed .",
    "the pipe nebula is , hence , an excellent place to study the initial conditions of star formation at scales of a few parsecs .",
    "the first extensive survey toward the pipe nebula was done by @xcite through single dish observations of co isotopologues .",
    "these authors were the first to suggest a clumpy distribution for the dense gas by detecting compact c@xmath6o cores in the main body of the cloud .",
    "it was not until the last few years that several surveys @xcite were carried out to explore the physical properties of the cloud .",
    "@xcite use 2mass data to construct a high resolution extinction map of the pipe nebula through which they identify a large number of high extinction cores with typical masses between 0.2 and 5  @xmath3 .",
    "molecular line observations reveal that they are starless cores in a very early evolutionary stage , associated with dense ( @xmath4  @xmath2 ) , relatively cold ( @xmath7  k ) , and fairly quiescent gas ( typical line widths of 0.4  , @xcite ) . non - thermal gas motions inside the cores are sub - sonic and mass independent .",
    "therefore , thermal pressure appears to be the dominant source of internal pressure .",
    "in addition , these cores appear to be pressure confined , but gravitationally unbound @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed an optical polarimetric survey toward the diffuse gas in the pipe nebula .",
    "they find a large scale magnetic field that appears to be mostly perpendicular to the cloud main axis .",
    "the magnetic field exerts a pressure ( @xmath010@xmath8  k@xmath2 ) that is likely responsible for driving the collapse of the gas and dust cloud along the field lines .",
    "the polarization properties significantly change along the pipe nebula .",
    "this fact allowed the authors to distinguish three regions in the cloud : b59 , the _ stem _ , and the _ bowl _ ( see fig .  [ fig : pipe ] ) .",
    "b59 shows low polarization levels but high dispersion of the polarization position angles . moving through the _ stem _ toward the _ bowl _ , the polarization level increases and the dispersion decreases .",
    "these authors propose that these three regions might be in different evolutionary stages .",
    "b59 is the only magnetically supercritical region and the most evolved of the pipe nebula , the _ stem",
    "_ would be at an earlier evolutionary stage , with material still collapsing , and finally , the _ bowl _ would be at the earliest stage , with cloud fragmentation just started .",

    "this represents , using the relationship @xmath15 @xcite , average values of a@xmath16@xmath04.4 to @xmath019.4 .",
    "the first case would represent a shallow core , more affected by the external radiation field , which tends to have a younger chemistry .",
    "the other extreme probably indicates a denser and more shielded core , where one would expect to find more complex and evolved molecules .",
    "however , note that this also depends on the time - scale needed to form the core @xcite .",
    "we find that cs ( see table  [ tab_abun ] ) , an early - time molecule , is detected in all the cores with abundances with respect to h@xmath13 of a few times @xmath17 , similar to the ones found in other dense cores @xcite or the ones obtained in gas  phase chemical models @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention that cores  14 and 48 show high cs abundance , one order of magnitude higher than cores  109 and 40 .",
    "a similar result is found for the c@xmath9s abundances .",
    "the derived abundances for the early - time molecule hcn toward the cores in our sample is very uniform , and seems to be independent of their physical properties .",
    "the early - time molecule cn , a molecule that is also detected commonly in dense cores , has also a significantly lower abundance ( a factor @xmath184 ) toward core  48 than toward the rest of the sample . where detected",
    ", the cn abundance varies only within a factor of five . on the other hand , another early - time molecule such as c@xmath19h@xmath13 , shows differences in abundances of at least a factor of five among cores  14 and 48 with respect to cores  40 and 109 .",
    "late - time molecules , such as n@xmath13h@xmath20  or deuterated molecules , are not broadly detected in our sample : n@xmath13h@xmath20  is detected except in core  48 .",
    "on the contrary , n@xmath13d@xmath20  is only detected on cores  40 and 109 , and dco@xmath20  only in core  109 .",
    "we found a higher abundance of n@xmath13h@xmath20  toward core  40 than toward core  109 by a factor of @xmath02 , while @xcite found an abundance of nh@xmath19 toward core  109 higher than that of core  40 by a factor of @xmath03.4 .",
    "however , both cores  40 and 109 show higher abundances in n@xmath13h@xmath20  than cores  14 and 48 . despite cores  14 and 40 having a similar average column density ,",
    "the former shows 5 times less abundance of n@xmath13h@xmath20  than the latter .",
    "moreover , core  14 does not show emission in any other late - time molecule while core  40 is detected in n@xmath13d@xmath20  showing an abundance only a factor of 4 lower than that of core  109 .",
    "briefly , the higher abundances in cores  109 and 40 with respect to core  14 and in particular to core  48 ( except for cs ) is an indication that cores  109 and 40 are more chemically evolved than cores  14 and 48 .",
    "however , the molecular abundances of these two late - time species are roughly an order of magnitude lower than the prototypical starless cores l1517b and l1498 @xcite , which suggests that cores  109 and 40 may be in an earlier evolutionary stage than cores in taurus .",
    "@xcite observed the emission of the nh@xmath19  ( 1,1 ) , nh@xmath19  ( 2,2 ) , ccs  ( 2@xmath211@xmath22 ) , and hc@xmath23n  ( 98 ) transitions towards 46 cores of the pipe nebula .",
    "cores 14 , 40 , 48 , and 109 were included in their observations .",
    "none of the lines were detected in core  48 , which is shown to be again the more chemically poor core of our sample .",
    "hc@xmath23n was not detected in core 14 , which also has the weakest ccs and nh@xmath19 lines .",
    "the four transitions were detected in cores 40 and 109 , but with some differences .",
    "the nh@xmath19 lines are much more intense in core 109 , a factor of @xmath04 for the ( 1,1 ) transition and @xmath09 for the ( 2,2 ) line , while the ccs line is more intense in core 40 , less than a factor of @xmath02 , and the hc@xmath23n lines are very similar in both cores , inside the rms .",
    "all these results are consistent with our observations : core  48 , which did not show emission of late - time molecules , is very poor chemically and shows a very young chemistry .",
    "core  14 , has some very weak emission of late - time molecules ( nh@xmath19 ) but only weak emission of ccs , an early - time molecule .",
    "core 40 is more evolved chemically and shows stronger emission of early - time molecules than of late - time molecules .",
    "finally , core  109 is the one showing more diversity of molecules and the more intense emission , in particular of late - time molecules .",
    "interestingly , the ccs abundance in core 109 is probably lower than in core 40 , which is consistent with the view that the ccs molecule is destroyed soon after the formation of a dense core , probably as a result of the contraction of the core @xcite .",
    "this would reinforce the view that this core is in a very advanced evolutionary state .    in summary",
    ", core 109 seems to be the more chemically evolved core , probably because it is more dense and because it shows higher abundances of late - time molecules .",
    "core 40 , with three times lower column density , also shows large n@xmath13h@xmath20abundances",
    ". it might be in an intermediate chemical evolutionary stage .",
    "these two cores probably are in an evolutionary stage slightly younger than that of the prototypical starless cores @xcite",
    ". cores  48 and 14 show similar physical properties in terms of size , mass and h@xmath13 column density , to cores  109 and 40 . however , they appear to be very chemically poor and , therefore , they could be in an even younger stage of chemical evolution .",
    "table  [ tab_resum ] shows the summary of the main properties of the cores relative to core 109 , which is the one that shows the strongest line emission . in this table",
    "we show the physical and chemical properties .",
    "additionally , we added the averaged polarimetric properties of the diffuse envelope around the cores @xcite : polarization fraction ( @xmath24 ) and dispersion of the polarization position angle ( @xmath25 ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mambo ] , the polarization vectors calculated from optical extinction can not be derived at the more dense regions , where the visual extinction is higher . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mambo ] , except for the map of core  48 with the lowest rms , the polarization vectors lie in regions below the 3-@xmath26 noise level .",
    "however , the trend of the polarization vectors is in general rather uniform over the whole map . indeed , there are vectors up to very close to the dense parts of the cores",
    ". consequently , the derived magnetic field properties of the diffuse surrounding medium are also representative of those of the dense part of the cores .    a relationship between the magnetic and the chemical properties of each core seems to exist .",
    "the two more chemically evolved cores , 109 and 40 , appear to be embedded in a strongly magnetized environment , as @xmath25 values clearly reflect ( see table  [ tab_resum ] ) .",
    "the other two cores , 14 and 48 , do not show very different morphological properties with respect to the previous two ( size and mass ) . however , their chemical properties are completely opposed , and they are likely younger cores in chemical time - scale .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic properties of cores  14 and 48 are also opposed to those of cores  40 and 109 .",
    "cores  14 and 48 are surrounded by a molecular diffuse medium that is much more turbulent than that surrounding the two previous ones .",
    "core  14 is possibly affected by the star formation undergoing in the nearby region b59 .",
    "core  48 appears to be dominated by turbulence and constitutes an exception in the _ stem _ , whose cores have uniform magnetic properties among them , showing low @xmath24 and high @xmath25 @xcite .    in summary , these four cores of the pipe nebula have similar masses and sizes , but they are in different stages of chemical evolution : cores  109 and 40 are much more evolved chemically than cores  48 and 14 .",
    "the different magnetic properties of the diffuse molecular environment suggest that cores  109 and 40 have grown in a more quiescent and slowly way ( probably through ambipolar diffusion ) , whereas the growth of cores  14 and 48 has occurred much faster , an indication that possibly a compression wave that generates turbulence or the turbulence itself @xcite . the longer time ",
    "scale of the ambipolar diffusion process could explain the more evolved chemistry found toward the cores surrounded by a magnetized medium .",
    "these features suggest two different formation scenarios depending on the balance between turbulent and magnetic energy in the surrounding environment .",
    "the importance of these results is worth of a more detailed study of the pipe nebula cores in order to fully confirm these trends .",
    "we carried out observations of continuum and line emission toward four starless cores of the pipe nebula spread out along the whole cloud selected in base of their magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "we studied their physical and chemical properties , and the correlation with the magnetic field properties of the surrounding diffuse gas .    1 .",
    "the dust continuum emission of the observed pipe nebula cores shows quite different morphologies . in the sample",
    "there are diffuse cores , such as cores  40 and 48 , and compact and dense cores , such as core  109 .",
    "we have also mapped a clumpy filament , which contains the embedded core  14 .",
    "this filament is possibly undergoing fragmentation into smaller cores of sizes comparable to that of the others .",
    "we derived average radii of @xmath00.09  pc ( @xmath018600  au ) , densities of @xmath01.3@xmath1@xmath2 , and core masses of @xmath02.5  @xmath27 .",
    "the dust continuum peak coincides within the errors with @xmath28 peak derived from the 2mass catalog .",
    "the continuum emission is more sensitive toward the dense regions , up to @xmath1810 magnitudes for the densest cores . on the other hand ,",
    "the diffuse emission is better traced by the extinction maps .",
    "the masses are in average @xmath03.4 times smaller .",
    "we have observed several early- and late - time lines of molecular emission toward the cores and derived their column densities and abundances .",
    "the starless cores of the pipe nebula are all very young , but they present different chemical properties possibly related to a different evolutionary stage .",
    "however , there does not seem to be a clear correlation between the chemical evolutionary stage of the cores and their position in the cloud .",
    "cores  109 and 40 show late - time molecular emission and seem to be more chemically evolved .",
    "core  109 shows high abundances of late - time molecules and it seems to be the more chemically evolved .",
    "core 40 has three times lower h@xmath13 column density than that of core  109 .",
    "it presents a large n@xmath13h@xmath20  abundance and the largest cn abundance , thus it might be in an intermediate chemical evolutionary stage .",
    "cores  48 and 14 show only early - time molecular emission , and core  14 presents weak n@xmath13h@xmath20  emission , and seem to be chemically younger than the other two cores .",
    "core  14 has a similar mass and size than core  40 , but the n@xmath13h@xmath20 , c@xmath19h@xmath13 , and cs abundances are about one order of magnitude lower than the core  40 abundances",
    ". our results and interpretation of the evolutionary stage of each core are consistent with the previous observations of @xcite in these same cores .",
    "there seems to be a relationship between the properties of the magnetic field in the cloud medium of the cores and the chemical evolutionary stage of the cores themselves .",
    "the two more chemically evolved cores , 109 and 40 , appear to be embedded in a strongly magnetized environment , with a turbulent to magnetic energy ratio of 0.05 and 0.27 , respectively .",
    "the two chemically younger cores , 14 and 48 , appear to be embedded in a more turbulent medium .",
    "this suggests that the magnetized cores probably grow in a more quiescent way , probably through ambipolar diffusion , in a time - scale large enough to develop the richer chemistry found . on the other hand",
    ", the less magnetized cores likely grow much faster , probably in a turbulence dominated process , in a time - scale too short to develop late - time chemistry .",
    "the pipe nebula has revealed to be an excellent laboratory for the study of the very early stages of the star formation .",
    "the studied cores show different morphologies , chemical evolutionary stages and magnetic properties .",
    "the physical and chemical properties are not directly linked as the competition between the magnetic field and turbulence at small scales seems to have an important influence in the core evolution .",
    "the importance of these results require a more detailed study of the chemistry and magnetic field properties of the cores to fully confirm these results .",
