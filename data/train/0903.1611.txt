    "the question is whether the constraint can be fulfilled exactly by a gaussian at all , and , if so , whether gwps fulfilling the constraint are reasonable trial functions in the sense that they still present a complete basis set .",
    "the advantage of the formulation of the hamiltonian in semiparabolic coordinates is that the constraint is already incorporated .",
    "however , in semiparabolic coordinates it is nontrivial to find gaussian type trial functions for the exact solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation because the laplacian is not of cartesian form , see eq .   , and includes centrifugal barriers . in the following",

    "imply that the set of 15 complex parameters @xmath55 of the general gwp is reduced to only five parameters @xmath82 for a restricted gwp satisfying the constraint !",
    "the question arises whether the restricted gwps form a complete basis set , such that any physically allowed state can be expanded in this basis .",
    "it is not evident that a superposition of restricted gwps whose centers are all located at the origin and which only differ by their complex widths , is flexible enough to represent arbitrary quantum states .",

    "since plane waves are known to form a complete basis it is proved that the restricted gwps , forming a superset of plane waves , are also complete , or even over - complete .",
    "however , they do not form a complete basis set of the 4d harmonic oscillator .",
    "the gwps satisfy the constraint , but `` for the price '' of the condition , i.e. , they are localized around the origin with zero mean velocity .",
    "it seems impossible that the time propagation of a single restricted gwp exhibits any meaningful dynamics with , in particular , a classical limit in the sense of the correspondence principle .",
    "however , a wave packet localized in the physical coordinate and momentum space of the hydrogen atom can be constructed as a superposition of the restricted gwps .",
