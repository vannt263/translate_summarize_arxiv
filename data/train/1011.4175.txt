    "one special chapter of nonlinear dynamics elaborated extensively by mathematicians consists in a study of iterative maps defined by analytic functions of complex variable .",
    "a classic object is a complex quadratic map  @xcite @xmath3 at  @xmath4 the behavior of the iterations is rather evident : for  @xmath5 the result diverges to infinity , and for  @xmath6 one observes residence of the variable  @xmath7 in a bounded part of the complex plane , and indeed convergence to  @xmath8 .",
    "the border between these two kinds of behavior is the unit circle  @xmath9 . at other values of the complex parameter",
    "@xmath10 a set in the complex plane  @xmath7 , the julia set , separating the bounded from divergent behavior appears to be rather complicated and nontrivial ( fractal ) .",

    "[ pf1 ] .",
    "alternatively , we can fix the initial condition  @xmath11 and consider how the behavior of the iterations depends on the complex parameter  @xmath10 . then , at some values of @xmath10 the iterations escape to infinity , and at others they stay in a bounded domain .",
    "the set on the complex plane  @xmath10 associated with the latter situation is called the mandelbrot set .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ pf1](a ) .",
    "note that the bounded dynamics may be periodic , quasiperiodic or chaotic .",
    "the domain of periodic behavior resembles a cactus and consists of a set of roundish formations touching each other and placed around one large area having the form of a cardioid .",
    "figures  1 ,  2 ,  3 on the plot designate periods of dynamics observed in several basic leaves of the `` cactus '' .",

    "a challenging problem is the realization of the phenomena intrinsic to the complex analytic maps in physical systems ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one successful attempt to implement this dynamics relates to a symmetric system of coupled maps for two real variables or to a system of two periodically driven coupled nonlinear oscillators  @xcite . in this context",
    "an interpretation of the mandelbrot set was suggested , as a domain of generalized partial synchronization  @xcite , and some aspects of the feasibility of the phenomena of complex dynamics in autonomous flow systems were studied  @xcite .",
    "an electronic analog device was designed simulating the dynamics of two coupled quadratic maps , in which the mandelbrot - like set was observed for the first time in a physical experiment  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we suggest an alternative approach that gives an opportunity to organize dynamics similar to that in the complex analytic maps . the main idea is based on interpretation of a complex amplitude of an oscillatory process as a complex variable .",
    "two alternately excited oscillators are used to pass the excitation between each other with transformation of the complex amplitude corresponding approximately to the complex quadratic map .",
    "earlier a similar idea was applied to construct physical systems delivering realistic examples for some well - known abstract concepts and phenomena of the nonlinear science , including the bernoulli map , a smale - williams attractor , arnold s cat map , and a robust strange nonchaotic attractor  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "2 we introduce a system of coupled oscillators alternately activated by means of modulation of the dissipation parameter accompanied with a turn - by - turn transfer of the excitation between the subsystems . in sec .",
    "3 we derive the shortened equations for the system using the complex amplitude approach .",
    "then , we undertake an approximate analytic solution of the equations .",
    "the result is the complex quadratic mapping , which represents the poincar map for the system and governs the state evolution on one period of the parameter modulation .",
    "we present and compare pictures on the parameter plane and the phase space portraits for the amplitude equations and those for the approximate analytic map ( the mandelbrot set and the julia sets ) . in sec .",
    "4 we turn again to the original coupled oscillator equations and consider results of numerical studies to observe and discuss deviations from the slow - amplitude approach , which become relevant with decrease of a parameter @xmath12 representing a ratio of the modulation period to the basic period of oscillations .",
    "we find that the most notable effect consists of rotation of the mandelbrot - like set in the complex parameter plane while its visible fractal - like structure persists .",
    "in addition , we reveal the gradual destruction of subtle details of this fractal structure ( starting from smaller scales ) as the parameter @xmath12 departs from the range of applicability of the method of slow amplitudes .",
    "we relate this phenomenon to non - resonance complex conjugate terms in the equations of the oscillators ( rewritten in terms of the complex variables ) , which are negligible in the large @xmath12 asymptotics . in sec .",
    "5 we modify original system in such way , that it becomes a system of coupled self - sustained oscillators .",
    "we show that in the parameter plane of this system the mandelbrot - like set can preserve .",
    "such system of two coupled elements , based on van der pol oscillators , is more convenient for electronic device construction .",
    "moreover , in special case it is equivqlent to the system with a smale - williams attractor  @xcite .",
    "thus , possibility of coexistence of the phenomena of complex analytic dynamics and the phenomenon of hyperbolic chaos is manifested .",

    "then , the `` germ '' for excitation of the second oscillator ( see the right - hand part of the second equation ) is the second harmonic component produced by the nonlinear quadratic transformation of the signal from the first oscillator , @xmath40 .",
    "the complex amplitude of the second oscillator on its active stage will be proportional to  @xmath41 .",
    "mixing with the auxiliary signal ( see the right - hand part of the first equation ) gives rise to a frequency component  @xmath13 with amplitude proportional to  @xmath41 .",
