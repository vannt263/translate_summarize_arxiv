    "materials used in nuclear wastes confinement are made of glasses with complex compositions , and are based mainly on an alumino - boro - silicate network .",
    "these glasses have been studied for decades with the aim of testing their durability and their chemical resistance to water leaching , the process believed to be the limiting factor for their long time durability @xcite .",
    "when such glasses are altered by water leaching , the layers formed on the surface are hydrated silica - like porous gels enriched with aluminum and calcium . although it is often argued that the protective property of this layer stops the alteration processes induced by the leaching , no real justification has yet been given @xcite .    in calcium",
    "aluminosilicate glasses ( cas ) , silicon and aluminum are both network formers and have a tetrahedral coordination with oxygens @xcite .",
    "the tetrahedra are connected by shared oxygen atoms which are called bridging oxygens ( bo ) and they form an amorphous network in which ca atoms are dispersed .",
    "depending on the al@xmath0o@xmath2/cao ratio , ca atoms play the role of modifiers if they create non - bridging oxygens ( nbo ) by breaking t - o - t linkages ( t = si / al ) and/or they play the role of charge balancing , by neutralizing the alo@xmath5 entities . in principle , the number of nbo atoms in a cas glass is entirely determined by the al@xmath0o@xmath2/cao ratio and this number is directly related to the viscosity of the glass forming liquid . however it has been shown that this simple picture is not fully correct and that an excess number of nbo atoms exists even for an al@xmath0o@xmath2/cao ratio equal to one , which corresponds - in theory - to a perfect polymerized network .",
    "this excess number of nbo atoms could explain the viscosity anomaly measured in these systems @xcite and could also be related to the existence of other structural units such as oxygen triclusters and/or highly coordinated si and al atoms .",
    "the calcium environment is also not very well defined in that it is quite difficult to attribute a specific coordination to this species .",
    "nevertheless , in pure cas systems , it was observed by x - ray and neutron spectroscopies that the distribution of oxygen neighbors around ca atoms is independent of the composition @xcite.another feature observed in aluminosilicate glasses is the al / al avoidance principle : as the formation of al - o - al linkages is energetically less favorable than si - o - al linkages , the occurrence of the former should be very low in cas structures @xcite",
    ".    due to the experimental difficulties to study thin layers , an important first step to obtain a microscopic understanding of these materials can be achieved by the use of molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "the aim of the present work is therefore to obtain a reasonable description of a cas glass which composition is closed to the composition of the protective porous layer .",
    "however , in the case of such complex ternary systems , it is extremely difficult to find classical potentials that are able to give simultaneously a reliable description of the ionic and covalent bond lengths , of the bond angles and of the dynamics of the system .",
    "alternatively , one can obtain a good description of such structural characteristics and of the dynamics of these complex systems from _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "but in this case , the price to pay is the very limited size of the system ( 100 to 200 atoms ) and the very short accessible length of the md trajectories , thus making difficult the generation of disordered systems with good statistics on the one hand , and the equilibration of the samples at low temperatures on the other hand . in the aim of testing the classical potentials , we intend to use an approach in which the structure of a glass generated by classical md is relaxed - and therefore tested - by _ ab initio _ md",
    "this approach has already been successfully used in the case of a sio@xmath0 glass @xcite and of a na@xmath0o-4sio@xmath0 glass @xcite . since",

    "simulations are limited to a rather small number of atoms , we first carried out a systematic study of the finite size effects on the aluminosilicate system of interest using a classical potential .    in this paper , we present the study of a calcium aluminosilicate glass by md simulations in which we analyzed the dependence of the structural and dynamical properties on the system size .",
    "in the first section , technical details on the md simulations are given .",
    "subsequently the dynamics of the liquids are presented in section two and the third section is devoted to the results obtained on the glass structure .",
    "finally we discuss and summarize the results .",

    "the first term of this pair potential corresponds to the coulomb term , the second one to the core repulsion , and the third and fourth ones are referred to as multipolar terms : @xmath13 the coulomb interactions were calculated using formal charges @xmath14 equal to + 4 for si , -2 for o , + 3 for al and + 2 for ca , and the standard ewald summation method with alpha l=7.2 was used where @xmath15 is the size of the cubic box .",
    "bond orientations in the cas system can be described by adding a three - body term involving the o - si - o , o - al - o and si - o - si triplets .",

    ".    liquid samples of 100 and 200 atoms , generated using a random starting configuration , were equilibrated at different temperatures ( from @xmath25 3000 k to @xmath25 7000 k ) .",
    "the lowest temperature for which the silicon self - diffusion was at least 7   after 1.8 ns of md trajectory for both system sizes , was taken as the liquid equilibration temperature : it corresponds to roughly 4200 k. then , we generated and equilibrated independent liquid samples of different sizes at this temperature during 1.8 ns : 8 samples of 100 atoms , 4 samples of 200 atoms , 2 samples of 400 atoms , 2 samples of 800 atoms and 1 sample of 1600 atoms .",
    "the sizes of the corresponding boxes were respectively 11.32  , 14.26  , 17.97  , 22.64   and 28.52  , corresponding to a density of 2.42 g.@xmath26 , which is the equilibrium density obtained with this potential at this temperature .",
    "the experimental density for glasses of similar compositions at 300 k lies between 2.55 and 2.60 g/@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the mean square displacements ( msd ) , @xmath28 , of each atomic species were calculated at different temperatures for the systems of 100 and 200 atoms . in order to obtain a good description of the dynamical properties , it appeared that an average over a larger number of samples was needed .",
    "therefore these dynamical properties were studied only for the smallest system sizes of 100 and 200 atoms and using averages over 30 independent samples .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] represents the msd of the various types of atoms in the 200-atoms liquid as a function of time in a logarithmic plot .    at short times , all curves exhibit a straight line with a slope of 2 which indicates that all atoms move ballistically .",
    "then , after a transient regime , the atoms show a diffusive behavior which is characterized by straight lines with slopes of 1 . from the mean squared displacements at long times , the self - diffusion constants @xmath29 were extracted using einstein s law : @xmath30 the resulting @xmath29 of the different species for systems of 200 atoms as a function of the inverse temperature are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "the most diffusive element is ca , followed by o , al and si . it is interesting to note that the al atoms follow the oxygen self - diffusion for all temperatures , despite the fact that , as si , it is a network former .",
    "this behavior resembles the one found in the al@xmath0o@xmath2-sio@xmath0 system @xcite . only at the lowest temperature the al",
    "self - diffusion approaches the one of the silicon atoms .",
    "the activation energies of the self - diffusion of the si , o , al and ca atoms were extracted from a linear fit of the curves in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( for 1/t greater than 2.3 @xmath31 k@xmath32 ) and are equal to 6.4 ev , 5.9 ev , 6.5 ev and 5.3 ev , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the diffusion constants as a function of temperature as well as the values of the activation energies do not show any differences between the 100-atoms and 200-atoms liquids , suggesting that no size effects exist - at least up to 200 atoms - for the dynamical quantities .",
    "this is in apparent contrast with the results of previous studies carried out on supercooled liquids @xcite and in silica @xcite which shows strong finite size effects in the dynamics of the smallest samples .",
    "however , in order to study more deeply the finite size effects on the dynamics of the cas liquids , more statistics would have been needed for systems of larger sizes as well .",
    "since our main purpose is to study the size effects on the glass structural properties , we considered that this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "after cooling down all liquids from 4200 k to 300 k using a linear quench with a rate of @xmath33 k.s @xmath32 and after a md simulation of 150 ps at 300 k , we performed 1000 additional steps for the structural analysis .",

    ", one can clearly notice that the systems of 100 atoms exhibit a different rdf than the ones of larger sizes since the si - o and al - o first peaks are narrower and higher .",
    "this indicates that the local order is more pronounced in the 100-atoms samples .",
    "the zoom on the ca - o rdf clearly shows two peaks in the maximum .",
    "this double peak is not due to poor statistics but appears to be due to correlations that exist in all samples of 100 atoms .    in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , we compare the si - ca , al - ca , al - al and ca - ca rdfs for the systems of 100- ( dashed lines ) and 1600-atoms ( bold lines ) . due to the small number of al and ca atoms ,",

    "the determination of interatomic distances is consequently quite difficult , particularly for the ca - ca distance . for systems of 100-atoms",
    ", we can remark that the rdfs show several peaks that are absent in the larger system . nevertheless , the rdfs of the 100-atoms system follow the global shape of the rdfs of the system with 1600 atoms , fig .",
    "[ figure4]b .",
    "the same behavior is observed for the si - si , si - al and o - o rdfs @xcite .",
    "the first peak of the si - ca and al - ca rdfs of the 1600-atoms system presents a double shoulder , fig .",
    "[ figure4]a and fig .",
    "[ figure4]c , which corresponds to two kinds of si - ca distances at 3.37   and 3.57  .",
    "a more pronounced double shoulder is also present on the first peak of the al - ca rdfs at 3.37   and 3.57   .",
    "these double shoulders are due to the presence of non - bridging atoms ( nbo ) in the sio@xmath5 or alo@xmath5 groups .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the non - bridging oxygen ( nbo ) atoms are defined as oxygen atoms that have only one network former ( si or al ) as nearest neighbor . here",
    ", these neighbors are counted using cutoff radii defined by the location of the minima after the first peaks in the si - o and al - o rdfs .    a detailed analysis of the si - ca rdf is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure5]a , b and c. figure [ figure5]a shows the first peak of the si - o rdf for the different environments q@xmath40 of the si atoms . since a q@xmath40 atom is defined as a network former atom surrounded by @xmath41 bridging oxygen atoms , a q@xmath40 tetra - coordinated network former is thus surrounded by ( 4-@xmath41 ) non - bridging oxygen atoms .",
    "figure [ figure5]a clearly shows that the first peak of the si - o rdf shifts to lower distances when the number of nbo is increased on the sio@xmath5 groups ( i.e. @xmath41 is decreased ) . the si - o bond length shifts from 1.60   to 1.52  .",

    "[ figure5]c , it can be clearly concluded that the first shoulder , observed in the first peak of the si - ca rdf , is due to nbo atoms and the second to bo atoms , since the separation of the two peaks becomes more and more pronounced as the si atoms are more and more surrounded by nbo atoms .    from the analysis of the 1600-atoms system ,",

    "some of the values given in tab .",
    "[ tab_dist ] can be compared with experimental distances obtained either on glasses or on crystalline analogous .",
    "interatomic distances do not change dramatically with composition and one can compare directly the si - o and the al - o distances with the experimental values presented in tab .",
    "[ tab_dist ] .    in summary , we find clear finite size effects for the 100-atoms system which affect the first peaks of the si - o , al - o and ca - o rdfs .",
    "these finite size effects suggest that the glass models become more locally organized for the smallest system size .",
    "for all the other system sizes , the rdfs give information on the local structure which is overall in agreement with experimental data except for the ca - o bond length that is found to be slightly too large .      in order to calculate angular distributions ,",

    "[ figure6]a , spreads from 90 to 180@xmath45 and does not present a distinctive shape with a clear maximum like in the si - o - si and si - o - al distributions . because of the low number of al - o - al linkages in the system , a better statistics would be needed in order to refine the al - o - al distribution . that a few al - o - al linkages are present in the glass samples is consistent with the fact that the al / al avoidance principle @xcite is not necessarily fulfilled in amorphous aluminosilicates .",
    "in order to estimate to what extent the al / al avoidance principle is violated in our glass samples , we computed the number of t - o - t linkage concentrations ( t , t = si or al ) that would be obtained if the si and al atoms were randomly distributed among all the possible network former sites in the 1600-atoms sample @xcite .",

    "the variation of the number of linkages does not exceed 1 % and remains inside the error bars , thus indicating that within the statistical errors no finite size effects can be detected on this quantity and that size effects only appear on the associated angular distributions .      in order to determine the si , al and ca coordination numbers",
    ", we used the same cutoff radii as the ones used for the angular distributions .",
    "we found that the local order of the si and al atoms is very well defined in that the atoms are always fourfold coordinated whatever the size of the system is .",
    "however , as the minimum of the ca - o rdf is not defined very well , we calculated the ca coordination distributions for ten different cutoff radii , chosen so that they sample regularly the region of the minimum ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] ) .",
    "only five of these distributions , as well as their average , are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] for the 1600-atoms system .",
    "the coordination distribution of the ca atoms is strongly dependent on the choice of the cutoff radii and therefore caution should be used while discussing the average ca coordination number .",
    "the averaged ca coordination distributions for the different system sizes are presented in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the ca atoms have multiple local environments , the number of oxygen surrounding the ca atoms ranging from 4 to 12 .",
    "the maxima of these distributions are located between 7 and 8 except for the 100-atoms systems . in that case",

    "however , in the simulated samples , we always find an excess number of nbo atoms . fig .",
    "[ figure10]a shows the percentage of nbo as a function of the system size and this percentage is clearly located between 10.7 % and 11.8 %",

    "it is , however , more difficult to make a clear relation between the other peaks and the partial correlations .    on the other hand , in the 1600-atoms @xmath75",
    ", one can notice the existence of a very small pre - peak around 0.7 @xmath32 ( denoted by a vertical dashed line in fig . [ figure13 ] ) which appears to be due to si - si , si - o and o - o correlations .",
    "since the al - al correlations do not contribute to this pre - peak , it is very likely that this feature is indeed due to the presence of the ca atoms which induce the existence of pockets or channels and consequently , the oorganisation of the matrix on large scales .",
    "this type of long - range organisation has already been observed in sodo - silicate glasses and melts @xcite .",
    "since no experimental data were available for the specific composition of the present work , in order to compare the computed @xmath74(q ) with experimental data , we had to generate a glass with a slightly different composition ( 60% sio@xmath0 , 10% al@xmath0o@xmath2 , 30% cao ) .",
    "this new simulation was performed on a system of 800 atoms following the same procedure as described beforehand .",
    "the comparison between the computed and experimental structure factors from ref .",
    "@xcite is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure14 ] .",
    "the agreement is good both for the positions of the peaks and for their intensities except at large q where irregularities do not permit to superpose the shoulder after the fourth peak .",
    "the difference between the two computed compositions is the sio@xmath0/cao ratio , which is lower in the case of the experimental comparison .",
    "the differences between the structure factors at the two compositions , fig . [ figure12 ] and fig .",
    "[ figure14 ] , mainly concern the two first peaks . in the experimental composition",
    "the first peak is lower and the second one higher than in the initial studied composition .",
    "this shift is due to the larger quantities of ca in the experimental composition and has already been observed in a neutron scattering study of calcium aluminosilicate glasses of different compositions @xcite .",
    "the set of interatomic potentials used to simulate the calcium aluminosilicate glasses leads to structures that reproduce a series of experimental features if the studied sample contains at least 200 atoms .",
    "firstly , the simulated neutron structure factor is globally in agreement with the experimental one although some of the first neighbor distances are not correctly reproduced .",
    "recent reverse monte carlo calculations @xcite carried out on glasses of several compositions have suggested that the distance discrepancies in the local ionic environments could explain the slight differences between the simulated and experimental structure factors . by stretching the local si - o distances by 0.02   and reducing the al - o and ca - o distances by respectively 0.05   and 0.1  , these differences could be removed .",
    "secondly , the al / al avoidance rule is qualitatively reproduced but we have no quantitative experimental results to compare with simulations . the fact that the avoidance rule is not completely obeyed has already been suggested in recent nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "the authors predict that there still exist al - o - al linkages in a sodium aluminosilicate glass with si / al = 0.7 and in a calcium aluminosilicate glass with si / al = 0.5 which suggests that the respective concentrations in si - o - si , si - o - al and al - o - al are dependent on the energetic cost of the local configurations surrounding each linkage .",
    "finally , another interesting structural feature concerns the existence of oxygen triclusters .",
    "if we consider that each ca atom is `` used '' to compensate the charged alo@xmath5 tetrahedra and that the remaining ca ions create non - bridging oxygens , the predicted concentration of non - bridging oxygens is lower than the simulated ones .",
    "this result means that the ca atoms are not completely consumed by the alo@xmath5 tetrahedra , and part of the alo@xmath5 tetrahedra are charge - balanced by the oxygen triclusters .",
    "the existence of the latter , proposed originally in ref .",
    "@xcite , has not been directly observed but is deduced from @xmath57o nmr measurements in aluminosilicate glasses .",
    "the existence of 5 % of non - bridging oxygen in a caal@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath76 glass , detected by @xmath57o nmr spectroscopy , suggests also the presence of oxygen triclusters @xcite .",
    "previous simulations based on similar potentials have also predicted the existence of oxygen triclusters in a caal@xmath0si@xmath0o@xmath76 glass @xcite .",
    "however for the glass models containing 100 atoms , the structural characteristics are quite different indicating that these systems are subject to finite size effects . to test whether these size effects are due to the used potential or to the complexity of the glass , we performed simulations on a 78-atoms system of pure a - sio@xmath0 by using two different potentials : the present one detailed in section [ sec : method ] and the so - called bks potential derived by van beest _ al .",
    "whereas the sio@xmath0 glass obtained with the bks potential did not show any finite size effects , the size effects observed in the present work on the rdf first peaks and on the angular distributions were still present with the potential described in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "the main differences between the two potentials reside in the fact that the bks potential comprises partial charges for the si and o ions and does not include three body terms .    in order to determine whether the size effects in the cas system are induced by the presence of the three body terms",
    ", we have performed calculations without the three body terms . by neglecting the angular terms ,",
    "we do not obtain a correct structure , since a large number of miscoordinated silicon atoms are found .",
    "however the structural quantities concerned by the finite size effects can still be examined .",
    "for instance , the first peaks of the si - o and al - o radial distribution functions for systems of 100 and 1600 atoms have been compared without the three body terms and we clearly observe the disappearance of the size effects on those rdfs .",
    "the finite size effects also disappear in the angular distributions .",
    "these considerations allow us to clarify the effect of the angular terms on the calculated glassy structures .",
    "the enhancement of the local order observed for the small systems is due to the three body terms : it completely disappears when these terms are removed",
    ".    however , for the smallest systems , finite size effects are still present since the structure on distances beyond @xmath77 is influenced by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "therefore it is not possible to investigate the intermediate range order , which in these type of materials extends up to 10 - 15  , in systems that are smaller than 10  .",
    "these effects are not responsible of the enhancement of the local structure , but rather of the modification of the structure factor at low @xmath78 .",
    "these effects are somehow trivial and can be easily be taken into account .",
    "in this work , we have presented a systematic study of the liquid dynamics and the structural properties of a calcium aluminosilicate glass as a function of the system size .",
    "this study was carried out by means of molecular dynamics simulations using a potential made of two - body and three - body interactions .",
    "the results show that finite size effects exist for the smallest system size ( 100 atoms ) and affect a large part of structural characteristics : the si - o - si and si - o - al angular distributions , the ca coordination numbers , the first peaks of the si - o , al - o and ca - o pair distribution functions , and the relative number of bridging oxygens , non - bridging oxygens and oxygens triclusters .",
    "most of these size effects were clearly attributed to the presence of three - body interactions in the potential .",
    "interestingly , no finite size effects were visible in the relative percentages of al - o - al linkages and on the ring size distribution .",
    "for the larger system size , the structural characteristics were compared to experimental data when possible and a correct agreement was obtained for the si - o and al - o interatomic distances and for the neutron static structure factors .",
    "however , the si - o - si and si - o - al mean angles and the ca coordination numbers were found to be slightly too large .    in conclusion ,",
    "the present work gives confidence in the fact that the local structure of relatively complex glasses can be studied by the means of _ ab initio _",
    "simulations carried out on relatively small samples ( 200 atoms ) . on the other hand , it also gives indications on the weaknesses of the presently used classical potential and guidelines for possible improvements .",
