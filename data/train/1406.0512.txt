    "observations over the past few years have shown that many transiting exoplanets ( principally hot jupiters ) have significantly non - zero orbital inclinations .",
    "this is , in most cases , measured via the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , which is a probe of the sky - projected orbital inclination ( @xmath3 ) , also known as the spin - orbit misalignment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite noted two different regimes in the distribution of @xmath3 versus stellar @xmath4 .",
    "planets orbiting cooler stars ( @xmath5  k ) tend to have aligned orbits ( with a few notable exceptions ) , while those orbiting hotter stars ( @xmath6 k ) have a much wider distribution of spin - orbit misalignments that is consistent with isotropic @xcite .",
    "several hypotheses have been put forward to explain these two regimes .",
    "@xcite proposed that most hot jupiters are emplaced on highly inclined orbits by processes such as planet - planet scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or kozai cycles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath7 k marks the location on the main sequence where cooler stars have deep , massive convective zones , whereas hotter stars do not .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that cooler stars convective zones are able to efficiently tidally couple to the planet and damp out the planetary orbital inclination within the main sequence lifetime , whereas those of hotter stars are not .",
    "@xcite recently presented simulations confirming the plausibility of this idea .",
    "@xcite instead proposed that hot jupiters are emplaced by disk migration within an inclined disk , coupled with the same tidal dissipation hypothesis as @xcite .",
    "the disk is torqued out of alignment with the stellar spin axis by gravitational interactions with a transitory binary companion on an inclined orbit in the birth cluster .",
    "further simulations along these same lines by @xcite and @xcite included magnetic and gravitational interactions between the host star and the disk ; both found that this remains a viable misalignment mechanism .",
    "@xcite had earlier found that magnetic interactions between the star and disk alone could torque the star out of alignment with the disk .",
    "@xcite argued that time variability in the bulk angular momentum of material being accreted by a protoplanetary system could result in a spin - orbit misalignment between the star and the planet - forming disk .",
    "another mechanism was proposed by @xcite , who modeled angular momentum transport via internal gravity waves within hot stars , and suggested that such angular momentum transport could drastically change the rotational properties of the stellar atmosphere on short time scales .",
    "the rotation of the stellar atmosphere , which is what is probed by all spin - orbit misalignment measurement techniques , would not reflect the bulk rotation of the star .",
    "an apparent spin - orbit misalignment could thus be generated even when the bulk angular momentum vectors of the star and planet are in fact well aligned .",
    "furthermore , @xcite called into question whether tidal damping could affect inclinations as proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that in order for tidal damping not to result in significant semi - major axis changes , inclinations must be driven to @xmath8 , which is not observed .",
    "@xcite , however , showed that the latter two of these states would eventually decay to the zero inclination state .",
    "in general , these hypotheses fall into two categories : either the planets have changed their orbital plane after their formation , or the planetary orbit and stellar rotation axes are misaligned for reasons unrelated to planet evolution , and are related to star formation or stellar physics .",
    "measurement of the spin - orbit misalignments of a statistically significant sample of long - period planets ( which should not have undergone significant tidal damping ) and multi - planet systems ( which should not have undergone violent migratory processes ) around both hot and cool stars will help to discriminate between these hypotheses .",
    "the vast majority of the measurements of the spin - orbit misalignments of transiting exoplanets have come via radial velocity observations of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , where distortions in the stellar line profile during the transit are interpreted as an anomalous radial velocity shift .",
    "an alternative method , which we utilize , is doppler tomography , which has been used to probe spin - orbit misalignments for both planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . here ,",
    "the spectral line profile distortions are spectroscopically resolved and tracked over the course of the transit .",
    "the motion of the line profile perturbation during the transit is a probe of the spin - orbit misalignment @xmath3 .",
    "while for the most rapidly rotating planet - host stars @xmath3 can be measured purely from photometry due to the effects of gravity darkening on the surface brightness profile of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this method results in a four - fold degeneracy between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "doppler tomography can break this degeneracy .",
    "in addition to measurements of @xmath3 , doppler tomography can be used to validate transiting planet candidates around rapidly rotating stars .",
    "these stars are not amenable to follow - up using high precision radial velocity observations due to their significantly rotationally broadened stellar lines .",
    "detection of the doppler tomographic transit signature allows us to verify that the transiting object is indeed orbiting the expected star , i.e. , that the system is not a background eclipsing binary blended with a brighter foreground star . by examining the line shape we can also rule out scenarios where the transiting object is another star , as we will be able to see an additional set of absorption lines superposed upon those of the primary .",
    "the limitation , however , is that doppler tomography can not measure the mass of the transiting object , and thus we can not distinguish between a hot jupiter , a brown dwarf , and a small m dwarf .",
    "all of these have similar radii and the latter of these would , in many cases , have an insufficient flux ratio to make a detectable imprint upon the visible light spectrum of the primary .",
    "to date the only transiting planet candidate validated using doppler tomography is wasp-33b @xcite .",
    "there are , however , a number of planet candidates discovered by the _ kepler _",
    "mission around rapidly rotating stars which can be validated using doppler tomography .",
    "we have begun a program using the telescopes at mcdonald observatory to validate suitable candidates , with a particular focus on longer - period candidates .",
    "these will provide a test of the hypotheses described above , as these planets should not have undergone significant tidal damping and so should retain their primordial orbital alignments .    in this paper",
    "we describe our doppler tomography code and present our observations of the hot jupiter kepler-13 ab .",
    "although kepler-13 ab has been validated as a planet using doppler beaming and ellipsoidal variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is one of the most favorable _ kepler _ targets for doppler tomography and thus presents a good test of our code .",
    "the kepler-13 ( aka koi-13 , bd+46 2629 ) system has long been known to be a proper motion binary @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined that it consists of two a - type stars with similar properties ( see table  [ starknowledge ] ) , which are separated by 1.12  @xcite .",
    "@xcite also determined that the transiting planet kepler-13 ab ( detected by * ? ? ? * ) orbits the brighter of the two binary components , kepler-13 a. despite the resulting blend , as the separation between kepler-13 a and b is much smaller than the size of one of _ kepler _ s pixels , the inferred radius for kepler-13 ab remains in the planetary range , albeit at the highly inflated end of that range .",
    "this is unsurprising , considering the luminous host star and close orbital proximity of the planet to the star , and consequently high planetary temperature .",
    "@xcite detected a third stellar component in the system in an eccentric binary orbit about kepler-13 b via the reflex motion of star b. they determined that this companion , kepler-13 c ( denoted kepler-13 bb by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has a mass of @xmath11 and an orbital period of 65.8 days .",
    "kepler-13 ab thus orbits one member of a stellar triple system ; alternatively , due to the massive nature of the planet kepler-13 ab , the system could be considered to be a hierarchical quadruple .",
    "kepler-13 a is distinguished as one of the hottest stars to host a confirmed planet ( @xmath12 k ) .",
    "stellar parameters for the three stars in the kepler-13 system are given in table [ starknowledge ] , while planetary and transit parameters are summarized in table [ oldknowledge ] .",
    "as kepler-13 ab is a hot jupiter , it is one of the hottest known planets ; @xcite estimated @xmath13 k using the secondary eclipse depth in the _ kepler _ passband .",
    "kepler-13 ab was first validated by @xcite through detection of a gravity - darkening signature in the transit lightcurve from _ kepler_. this also enabled them to measure the spin - orbit misalignment , albeit with degeneracies , to be @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite detected doppler beaming and ellipsoidal variations due to the planetary orbit , and used these to measure the mass of kepler-13 ab to be @xmath16 , putting it firmly below the deuterium burning limit .",
    "many of these different authors , however , found conflicting values for some of the transit and system parameters , especially the impact parameter @xmath17 , ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 ( see table [ oldknowledge ] for the planetary parameters ) . while the orbital plane of kepler-13 ab has been shown to be precessing , resulting in changes in the transit duration and impact parameter @xcite , the rate of change of the impact parameter found by @xcite , @xmath18  yr@xmath19 , is much too small to account for these discrepancies . while @xcite found no evidence for orbital eccentricity ,",
    "recently @xcite measured a secondary eclipse time offset by @xmath20 seconds from that expected assuming a circular orbit .",
    "this could be caused by either a very small eccentricity ( @xmath21 ) , or a bright spot on the planetary surface offset to the west of the substellar point .",
    "kepler-13 a is rapidly rotating ( @xmath22 km  s@xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bright for a _ kepler _ target ( @xmath23 ) , making it an excellent target for doppler tomography .",
    "while there is a previous measurement of @xmath3 via gravity darkening @xcite , as noted above this method can not distinguish between prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "we can break this degeneracy with doppler tomography . with this work kepler-13 ab",
    "becomes the first planet with measurements of @xmath3 from both photometric and spectroscopic techniques , an important consistency check .",
    "additionally , @xcite showed that , in addition to the stellar @xmath4 , the planetary scaled semi - major axis @xmath24 and mass ratio @xmath25 are correlated with the degree of alignment .",

    "observations of kepler-13 ab were taken with two telescopes located at mcdonald observatory , the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) and the 2.7 m harlan j.  smith telescope ( hjst ) .",
    "the het utilizes a fiber - fed cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph , the high - resolution spectrograph ( hrs ; * ? ? ?",

    "the extracted spectra are then divided by the blaze - profile function , and any residual curvature is removed by fitting a second - order polynomial using a @xmath71-clipping routine and normalizing .",

    "we note that in computing an average line profile across a spectrum we ignore variations in the limb darkening parameter as a function of wavelength .",
    "as we are interested in the variations in the line profile as a function of time , rather than the detailed line shape , this should not have a significant effect upon our results .",
    "the extraction of the average line profiles from the spectra proceeds in several steps .",
    "all steps involve fitting a model spectrum to the data . in all cases this model is produced using the least squares deconvolution method of @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a model spectrum is produced by convolving a model line profile with a series of appropriately weighted delta functions at the wavelengths of the spectral lines .",
    "we fit this model spectrum to the data using the least squares methods of @xcite , as implemented in the idl function mpfit and derivatives .",
    "we first select several orders of the spectrum with many telluric lines and few or no stellar lines .",
    "we produce a model telluric spectrum using least squares deconvolution using a telluric line list ( obtained from the geisa database ) , and assuming a gaussian line profile .",
    "this model spectrum is fit to the data , leaving only the velocity offset between the extracted spectrum and the telluric rest frame as a free parameter .",
    "we assume that the telluric rest frame is identical to the spectrograph rest frame ( @xmath72 the wind speed , which is much smaller than the velocity scales of interest to us ) , and so we shift the spectra into this frame .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the individual spectra display a rms scatter in the telluric velocities of @xmath73 m s@xmath19 , again much smaller than both the velocity scales of interest and the instrumental resolution , although there is a zero - point offset of @xmath74 km s@xmath19 between the spectrograph s intrinsic wavelength calibration and the telluric velocity frame .",
    "now that we have a velocity frame fixed to the earth , we correct for the earth s orbital and rotational motion and shift the spectra into the solar barycentric rest frame .",
    "next we co - add each set of spectra taken on each night , creating several nightly master spectra .",
    "for each nightly master spectrum we create a model stellar spectrum .",
    "this is produced by obtaining a line list from vienna atomic line database ( vald ; * ? ? ?",
    "the line list includes the wavelength of each line , as well as a line depth calculated by vald using stellar model atmosphere parameters appropriate to our target .",
    "we produce an analytic rotationally broadened line profile using eqn .  18.14 of @xcite .",
    "this profile includes only the effects of rotation ; at this stage in the process , we only require an approximately correct line shape .",
    "we then fit the model spectrum to each nightly master spectrum , leaving only the velocity offset between the stellar and solar barycentric frames as a free parameter .",
    "now that we have obtained these nightly velocity offsets , we shift all of the spectra into the stellar barycentric rest frame .",
    "we note that this assumes that there is no significant acceleration of the star over the course of one night s observations ( typically one to a few hours ) .",
    "as kepler-13 is a small separation visual binary where one component is itself a single - lined spectroscopic binary , we undertook a small modification to this step for this system . due to the motion of kepler-13",
    "b in velocity space , fitting a single line profile results in a bias in the velocity offsets of the spectra that is correlated with the orbital phase of kepler-13 b. in order to correct for this , we instead fit a model spectrum produced using two analytic rotationally broadend line profiles , with a time - dependent velocity separation given by the orbital elements of @xcite .",
    "we determined the contrast between the two profiles by fitting two model line profiles to final extracted line profiles using the unmodified code .",
    "now that all of the spectra are fixed to the same velocity frame , we co - add all of the out - of - transit spectra to create a template spectrum .",
    "we create a model spectrum using the same methodology as described above . here , however , we fix the velocity offset between model and data at zero and leave the depth of each line as a free parameter .",
    "we thus obtain best - fit line depths from our high signal - to - noise template spectrum .",
    "the final step is to extract the time series line profiles themselves . for each spectrum we again produce a model spectrum .",
    "the line depths are fixed at the best - fit values found earlier . here",
    "the free parameters are the depth of the line profile in each pixel .",
    "an example of one of these fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] . for each spectrum",
    "we compute the average line profile by computing the weighted mean of the line profiles extracted from each order .",
    "each order s line profile is weighted by the product of the signal - to - noise at the center of that order and the total equivalent width of all lines in that order , after @xcite .",
    "any orders with noisy line profiles ( i.e. , the scatter in the continuum is greater than an empirically determined value ) are excluded from the computation of the weighted mean .",
    "the line profiles from the different orders are also regridded to a common velocity scale .",
    "we then perform the same process on the template spectrum to obtain an out - of - transit template line profile .",
    "we subtract this template line profile from each of the time series line profiles , resulting in the time series line profile residuals , which display the transit signature .    for kepler-13",
    ", we must again modify this step due to the complicated nature of the system .",
    "as will be discussed later , simply subtracting the line profile from our out - of - transit template results in significant systematics because the overall line profile varies as a function of time due to the orbit of kepler-13 b. in order to correct for this we subtract from each line profile the average line profile from that night of observations . while this subtracts off some of the transit signal , it eliminates almost all of the systematics in the time series line profile residuals .",
    "now that the time series line profile residuals have been computed , we must extract the transit parameters from these data .",
    "we compute a model for the time series line profile residuals and fit this to the data .",
    "the model is constructed by numerically integrating over the stellar disk , summing the contributions from each surface element to the overall line profile .",
    "we divide the stellar disk into approximately 8,000 surface elements .",
    "we utilize cartesian coordinates for the integration and subsequent computations .",
    "we assume a gaussian line profile with standard deviation 5 km s@xmath19 for each surface element ; these are then appropriately doppler shifted , assuming solid body rotation , and scaled by a quadratic limb darkening law .",
    "we also neglect macroturbulence ; see  [ results ] for further discussion of our assumptions on the lack of differential rotation and macroturbulence .    in order to improve computational efficiency",
    ", we do not perform the full integration for each exposure . instead",
    ", we first compute the out - of - transit line profile . then , we compute the location of the planet at the beginning and the end of each exposure ( assuming a circular orbit ) , and for each surface element compute the fraction of the exposure for which that surface element is obscured by the planet . for each surface element , we diminish the out - of - transit line profile by the line profile contribution from that surface element , multiplied by the fraction of the exposure for which that surface element is covered by the planet .",
    "finally , we convolve each line profile with a model instrumental point spread function .    the steps outlined above are applicable for computing a model for an arbitrary transiting planet . however , for kepler-13 ab we need to take some extra care because of the presence of the binary companion kepler-13 b and its orbit about kepler-13 c ; we must include kepler-13 b s moving line profile in our model .",
    "we use the orbital elements for kepler-13 b s orbit about kepler-13 c presented by @xcite to calculate the velocity of kepler-13 b at each exposure .",
    "we then compute a rotationally broadened line profile for kepler-13 b using the model described above , doppler shift it and scale it relative to the kepler-13 a profile , and add it to the line profile for kepler-13 a. including this profile and the resulting dilution of the spectroscopic transit signature is necessary to accurately model the data .",
    "ideally , we would simply fit for all relevant parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath17 , @xmath38 ) simultaneously . as our time",
    "series line profiles are derived from the average of many lines across a wide region of the spectrum , and the limb darkening and therefore the detailed line shape change as a function of wavelength , our model line profiles do not fit the average line profile to better than a few percent in the wings of the profile .",
    "this poses difficulties for extracting @xmath38 , as well as the transit parameters .",
    "we therefore adopted a two - stage fitting process , first extracting @xmath38 from a single line and then @xmath3 and @xmath17 from the time series line profile residuals .    for each sequential parameter extraction we used a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) to sample the likelihood function of the model fits to the data .",
    "in all cases we used four chains each of 150,000 steps , cutting off the first 20,000 steps of burn - in .",
    "in addition to our free parameters for each fit , we also wished to incorporate prior knowledge from the literature , e.g.  on the transit duration for kepler-13 ab .",
    "we thus set gaussian priors upon these parameters ; that is , assuming that the errors are gaussian , we can define an `` effective '' @xmath75 statistic @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the data , @xmath78 the model , @xmath71 the calculated error on each data point , @xmath79 the value of parameter @xmath80 at the given iteration of the markov chain , @xmath81 the value of parameter @xmath80 from the literature , and @xmath82 the uncertainty on parameter @xmath80 from the literature , and we are summing over @xmath83 data points and @xmath80 model parameters where we have prior information .",
    "first , we model a single line , the ba ii line at @xmath36141.7   , chosen because it is deep but unsaturated and isolated .",
    "we fit the nightly master spectra with models of the line profiles of kepler-13 a and b , neglecting any contribution from the transiting planet .",
    "we leave the @xmath38 of each star , the contrast between the two stars , and eight nightly velocity offsets as free parameters .",
    "we set gaussian priors upon two quadratic limb darkening parameters for each star , each with a width 0.1 , and upon the five parameters determining the radial velocity variation of kepler-13 b ( @xmath47 , epoch , @xmath49 , @xmath84 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "for the limb darkening coefficients we use coefficients in the sloan _",
    "r _ band ( as this is the closest standard photometric band to the ba ii @xmath36141.7    line ) , taken from the tables of @xcite for an atlas model atmosphere and interpolated to the stellar parameters of kepler-13 a and b as presented by @xcite using the jktld code .",
    "we use the methods of @xcite to obtain even sampling in limb darkening space . for the orbital parameters , we set the initial value and prior width to the best - fit value and 1-@xmath71 uncertainty , respectively presented by @xcite",
    "; see table [ starknowledge ] .",
    "second , we fit the time series line profile residuals with an appropriate model using another mcmc . here",
    "we leave @xmath3 and @xmath17 as free parameters , and set priors on the @xmath38 of kepler-13 a and contrast between kepler-13 a and b ( with the prior value and width set to the median values and 1-@xmath71 uncertainty , respectively , on these parameters from the first mcmc ) , and the limb darkening coefficients of kepler-13 a , transit depth @xmath85 , transit duration , planetary orbital period , and planetary orbital epoch , with all values and uncertainties / prior widths taken from @xcite .",
    "we fix the @xmath38 and orbital parameters of kepler-13 b at values from our first mcmc and @xcite , respectively , in the interests of computational efficiency and as uncertainties in these parameters should have a minimal effect on the line profile residuals .",
    "we note that in principle it is possible to measure the time of mid - transit and the transit duration directly from the spectroscopic data .",
    "additionally , @xmath85 and @xmath86 may be measured independently ( the width of the transit signature depends on @xmath85 , while the area under the transit signature is proportional to @xmath86 ) .",
    "if a system is affected by dilution , the measured value of @xmath86 will be smaller than that inferred from the measurement of @xmath85 from the transit signature width , which is unaffected by dilution . in practice , however , given finite spectral resolution , limited time resolution , and relatively low signal - to - noise , these values are best determined from _ kepler _ photometry .",
    "we thus incorporate these parameters via priors in our mcmcs .    in our second set of mcmcs ,",
    "we fit the model directly to the time series line profile residuals .",
    "alternatively , we also use a method of binning the spectra to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this method rests upon the following observation .",
    "neglecting differential rotation of the star and assuming a circular orbit for the planet , the rate of motion of the planetary transit signature across the line profile ( @xmath87 ) will be constant .",
    "given the transit duration , each value of @xmath87 corresponds to a single value of the velocity difference between the locations of the transit signature at ingress and egress , @xmath88 . in geometrical terms",
    ", the path of the planetary transit signature in the time series line profile residual plots will be a straight line .",
    "for a given value of @xmath88 , the transit signature will occur at some velocity @xmath89 in the @xmath90 spectrum .",

    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , who found splitting of the frequency spectrum peak associated with rotation , likely due to differential rotation .    in order to test the effects of this level of differential rotation on our measurement of the transit parameters , we modified our second mcmc to include differential rotation .",

    "we note that the presence of even strong differential rotation can not bring our value of @xmath3 into agreement with that found by @xcite .",

    "s photometric precision , there is little evidence for any pulsation of kepler-13 a which could result in this type of macroturbulence .",
    "@xcite conducted simulations of convection in the outer layers of massive stars due to an opacity peak produced by fe ionization .",
    "they found that such zones can cause surface granulation and consequent small - scale velocity fields in stellar photospheres .",
    "they find , however , that this effect does not occur for stars with @xmath152 for galactic metallicities , and is furthermore more prominent at low surface gravities .",
    "as kepler-13 a is below this luminosity cutoff ( @xmath153 ) and has high surface gravity ( @xmath154 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we conclude that surface granulation due to this mechanism should not occur for kepler-13 a.    a key question for estimating the effects of macroturbulence upon our results lies with the scales of macroturbulent velocity fields in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "if these scales are much smaller than the size of the projected planetary disk during the transit , then this will simply increase the range of radial velocities over which the planet subtracts light from the line profile .",
    "the effect will be to `` smear out '' the transit signature , but this should not affect the measured value of @xmath3 . if , however , the macroturbulent velocity field changes on scales of similar or greater size as the planetary disk , then the velocity of the region of the stellar disk covered by the planet will differ from that expected if taking only rotation into account .",
    "thus , the planetary transit signal in each spectrum will exhibit a quasi - random shift from the expected velocity .",
    "@xcite presented evidence that some of the large number of frequencies seen in the frequency spectra of @xmath155 sct ( early a ) stars observed by corot are in fact due to surface granulation rather than pulsations , as pulsations at these frequencies would be of such high degree @xmath156 that they should not be evident in integrated disk photometry .",
    "based upon the inferred granulation frequencies , they find that the granulation properties follow scaling laws derived for solar - type stars .",
    "when scaling from such solar models , @xcite make the assumption that the size of granulation cells is proportional to the atmospheric pressure scale height @xmath157 .",
    "@xcite use the scaling relation @xmath158 . using these relations and the stellar properties of kepler-13",
    "a from @xcite , we estimate that the size of any surface granulation cells for kepler-13 a should be @xmath159 times that of such cells on the sun , or @xmath160 , comfortably below the size scale of the planetary disk ( using an average solar granule size of 1300 km , from * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , given the uncertainty in the relations used to derive this estimate , we choose to include `` jitter '' caused by large - scale macroturbulent cells in the stellar atmosphere in our mcmcs ( note that this is not the same as the jitter frequently invoked as a source of noise in radial velocity observations ) .    in order to simulate the effect of macroturbulence on the size scale of the planet , we use the following approach .",
    "we allow each of the time series line profile residuals to have a small velocity offset from its nominal value .",
    "the effect of this is to shift the transit signature in that line profile residual in velocity space .",
    "since we have already subtracted off the average line profile shape , this mimics a velocity shift of the transit signature due to large - scale macroturbulence rather than a radial velocity offset for the entire line profile . for computational reasons we apply this velocity shift to the model line profile residuals , not the data . at each mcmc step",
    ", we perform a single parameter minimization for each velocity offset using mpfit .",
    "similar methodologies have been used by @xcite to deal with jitter and by @xcite to handle stellar pulsations .",
    "we limit the velocity offset amplitude to 15 km s@xmath19 in order to prevent the model transit signatures from latching on to the remaining systematics in the data .",
    "the mean offset amplitude is 5.7 km s@xmath19 .",
    "from these mcmcs , we obtain @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "we thus find that including `` jitter '' and differential rotation have opposite systematic effects on our results : large - scale macroturbulence shifts the best - fit parameters to higher @xmath3 and lower @xmath17 , while differential rotation shifts them to lower @xmath3 and higher @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we expect that these effects should largely cancel each other out , and our overall result should not be affected , while increasing the uncertainty in our results .",
    "in order to remain @xmath112 consistent with both the differential rotation and `` jitter '' mcmc results , we therefore adopt @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",

    "if this is rotation then , given this and the likely too high value of @xmath186 assumed by @xcite , the actual temperature ( and therefore surface brightness ) contrast between the poles and equator of kepler-13 a should be smaller than that assumed by @xcite .",

    "given the characteristics of the kepler-13 and the highly inclined orbit that we find for kepler-13 ab , it seems natural that it could have been emplaced through migration within an inclined disk produced via the mechanism of @xcite .",

    "we note , however , that these arguments rest upon the tidal circularization timescale being longer than the age of the system ; as tidal theory continues to be not well understood , the eccentricity damping timescale may be very uncertain . additionally , we note that due to these uncertainties we can not definitively exclude any mechanisms for the emplacement of kepler-13 ab upon its current inclined orbit .",

    "_ gaia _ is estimated to have an astrometric precision of @xmath198 @xmath199as for stars with @xmath200 @xcite , like both kepler-13 a and b. thus , it should be capable of detecting both the mutual orbit of kepler-13 a and bc ( @xmath196 mas yr@xmath19 for a circular , face - on orbit ) and the orbit of kepler-13 b about c ( total displacement @xmath201 @xmath199as ) .",
    "together with the radial velocity observations of @xcite , this will allow the measurement of the true mass of kepler-13 c and its orbital plane .",
    "while the orbital period of kepler-13 a around bc is likely too long to obtain a good orbital solution ( @xmath202 yr ) , _ gaia _ should nonetheless be able to place some constraints upon the system parameters .",
    "the astrometric orbit of kepler-13 a due to kepler-13 ab is too small to be detectable by _ gaia _ ( total displacement @xmath203 @xmath199as ) .",
    "@xcite note that , in principle , the spin - orbit misalignment for kepler-13 ab can be measured using a third mechanism : the photometric rossiter - mclaughlin effect @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , given the scatter in the single - quarter @xcite lightcurve of @xmath204 ppm , and that they estimate the amplitude of the photometric rossiter - mclaughlin effect to be @xmath205 ppm , this measurement is probably out of reach of even the full 16-plus quarter _ kepler _ lightcurve .",
    "we have constructed a doppler tomography code which now rivals previously established codes in terms of precision . we have validated this code by analyzing data on a transit of wasp-33 b. we have presented doppler tomographic observations for the _ kepler _ planet kepler-13 ab , finding a prograde orbit and measuring a much larger spin - orbit misalignment than that previously found by @xcite via the gravity darkened light curve . given the disagreement between these two techniques , observations of further systems via both techniques will be of interest to determine the reason for the disagreement .",
    "we have also suggested that , due to its highly inclined , circular orbit , the ( likely ) long tidal damping timescale of the system , and the presence of a wide binary companion , kepler-13 ab may have been emplaced via migration within an inclined disk .",
    "simulations of the system could confirm the viability of this hypothesis for the kepler-13 system , but these are beyond the scope of the current work .",
