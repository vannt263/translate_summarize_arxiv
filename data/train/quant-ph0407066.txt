    "in this paper , we consider the scenario where alice wants to send a secret ( classical ) @xmath0-bit message to bob using an @xmath1-bit classical shared key , and where only one - way transmission from alice to bob is possible ( or at least where interaction is only available with a prohibitively long delay ) . if interaction had been available , we could have achieved ( almost ) perfect secrecy using standard quantum key exchange , even if @xmath2 . but with only one - way communication , we need @xmath3 even with quantum communication @xcite .",
    "we study the question of whether there might still be some fundamental differences between the case where quantum as opposed to classical communication is used . in this direction , we present two examples of cryptosystems with perfect security producing @xmath0-bit quantum ciphertexts , and with key length @xmath4 , respectively @xmath5 . we show that given plaintext and ciphertext , and even when applying an optimal measurement to the ciphertext , the adversary can learn no more than @xmath6 , respectively @xmath7 bit of shannon information on the key .",
    "this should be compared to the fact that for a classical cipher with perfect security , the adversary always learns @xmath0 bits of information on the key . while proving these results , we develop a method which may be of independent interest , for estimating the maximal amount of shannon information that a measurement can extract from a mixture .",
    "we note that the first example can be implemented without quantum memory , it only requires technology similar to what is needed for quantum key exchange , and is therefore within reach of current technology .",
    "the second example can be implemented with a circuit of @xmath8 gates out of which only @xmath9 are elementary quantum gates .",
    "we also discuss the composition of ciphers , i.e. , what happens to the uncertainty of keys when the same quantum cipher is used to encrypt several blocks of data using independent keys .",
    "this requires some care , it is well known that cryptographic constructions do not always compose nicely in the quantum case .",
    "for composition of our ciphers , however , we shows that the adversary s uncertainty about the keys grows linearly with the number of blocks encrypted , and in some cases it can be shown to grow exactly as one would expect classically .    on the other hand , we show that there is a limit to how different the quantum and classical cases can be .",
    "namely , the most probable key ( i.e. the min - entropy of the key ) , given matching plain- and ciphertexts , has the same probability in both cases .    on the technical side , a main observation underlying our results on shannon key - uncertainty",
    "is that our method for estimating the optimal measurement w.r.t .",
    "shannon entropy can be combined with known results on so called entropic uncertainty relations @xcite and mutually unbiased bases @xcite .",
    "we note that somewhat related techniques are used in concurrent independent work by divincenzo et al .",
    "@xcite to handle a different , non - cryptographic scenario .",
    "while we believe the above results are interesting , and perhaps even somewhat surprising from an information theoretic point of view , they have limited practical significance if perfect security is the goal : a key must never be reused , and so we do not really have to care whether the adversary learns information about it when it is used .",
    "however , there is a different potential application of our results to the case where only a short secret key is available , and where no upper bound on the message length is known a priori .",
    "in such a case , only computational security is possible and the standard classical way to encrypt is to use a stream - cipher : using a pseudorandom generator , we expand the key into a long random looking keystream , which is then combined with the plaintext to form the ciphertext .",
    "the simplest way of doing such a combination is to take the bit - wise xor of key and plaintext streams . in a known plaintext attack , an adversary",
    "will then be able to learn full information on a part of the keystream and can try to analyze it to find the key or guess other parts of the keystream better than at random . in general , any cipher with perfect secrecy ,",
    "@xmath0-bit plain- and ciphertext and @xmath1-bit keys can be used : we simply take the next @xmath1 bits from the keystream and use these as key in the cipher to encrypt the next @xmath0 bits of the plaintext .",
    "it is easy to see that for any classical cipher , if the adversary knows some @xmath0-bit block of plaintext and also the matching ciphertext , then he learns @xmath0 bit of shannon information on the keystream .",
    "if instead we use quantum communication and one of our quantum ciphers mentioned above , intuition suggests that an adversary with limited resources is in a more difficult situation when doing a known plaintext attack : if measuring the state representing the ciphertext only reveals a small amount of information on the corresponding part of the keystream , then the adversary will need much more known plaintext than in the classical case before being able to cryptanalyze the keystream .",
    "care has to be taken in making this statement more precise : our results on key uncertainty tell us what happens when keys are random , whereas in this application they are pseudorandom .",
    "it is conceivable that the adversary could design a measurement revealing more information by exploiting the fact that the keystream is not truly random .",
    "this , however , is equivalent to cryptanalyzing the generator using a _ quantum _ computation , and is likely to be technologically much harder than implementing the quantum ciphers . in particular ,",
    "unless the generator is very poorly designed , it will require keeping a coherent state much larger than what is required for encryption and decryption  simply because one will need to involve many bits from the keystream simultaneously in order to distinguish it efficiently from random .",
    "thus , an adversary limited to measurements involving only a _ small _ number of qubits will simply have to make many such measurements , hoping to gather enough classical information on the keystream to cryptanalyze it .",
    "our results apply to this situation : first , since the adversary makes many measurements , we should worry about what he learns on average , so shannon information is the appropriate measure .",
    "second , even though the keystream is only pseudorandom , it may be genuinely random when considering only a small part of it ( see maurer and massey @xcite ) .    in sect .",
    "[ app ] , we prove a lower bound on the amount of known plaintext the adversary would need in order to obtain a given amount of information on the keystream , for a particular type of keystream generator and assuming the size of coherent states the adversary can handle is limited .",
    "we believe that quantum communication helps even for more general adversaries and generators .",
    "however , quantifying this advantage is an open problem .",
    "we stress that our main goal here is merely to point out the potential for improved security against a bounded adversary .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the standard notions of shannon entropy @xmath10 of a probability distribution , conditional entropy , etc .",
    "a related notion that also measures `` how uniform '' a distribution is , is the so called _ min - entropy_. given a probability distribution @xmath11 , the min - entropy is defined as @xmath12 as usual , @xmath13 for random variable @xmath14 is the min - entropy of its distribution .",
    "min - entropy is directly related to the `` best guess '' probability : if we want to guess which value random variable @xmath14 will take , the best strategy is to guess at a value with maximal probability , and then we will be correct with probability @xmath15 . given the value of another random variable @xmath16 , we can define @xmath17 simply as the min - entropy of the distribution of @xmath14 given that @xmath18 , and similarly to shannon entropy , we can define @xmath19 .",
    "the min - entropy can be thought of as a worst - case measure , which is more relevant when you have access to only one sample of some random experiment , whereas shannon entropy measures what happens on average over several experiments .",
    "to illustrate the difference , consider the two distributions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "they both have min - entropy 1 , even though it intuitively seems there should be more uncertainty in the second case , indeed the shannon entropies are 1 and 1.5 .",
    "in fact , we always have @xmath22 , with equality if @xmath14 is uniformly distributed .",
    "consider a classical cryptosystem with @xmath0-bit plain and ciphertexts , @xmath1-bit keys and perfect secrecy ( assuming , of course , that keys are used only once ) .",
    "we identify the cryptosystem with its encryption function @xmath23 .",
    "we call this an @xmath24-cipher for short .",
    "consider an @xmath24-cipher @xmath25 .",
    "we define the _ shannon _ _ key - uncertainty _ of @xmath25 to be the amount of shannon entropy that remains on an @xmath1-bit key given @xmath0-bit blocks of plain- and ciphertexts , i.e. @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are random variables corresponding to the random choices of key , plaintext and ciphertext blocks for @xmath25 , and where the key is uniformly chosen .",
    "min - entropy key - uncertainty _ of @xmath25 is defined similarly , but w.r.t .",
    "min - entropy , as @xmath28 .    from the definition",
    ", it may seem that the key uncertainties depend on the distribution of the plaintext .",
    "fortunately , this is not the case .",
    "the key - uncertainty in the classical case is easy to compute , using the following slight generalization of the classical perfect security result by shannon :    let @xmath25 be a cipher with perfect security , and with plaintext , ciphertext and keyspace @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , assume that keys are chosen uniformly . for any such cipher",
    ", it holds that the distribution of the key , given any pair of matching ciphertext and plaintext is uniform over a set of @xmath31 keys .    by perfect security",
    ", we must have @xmath32 .",
    "now , let us represent the cipher in a table as follows : we index rows by keys and columns by plaintexts , and we fill each entry in the table with the ciphertext resulting from the key and plaintext on the relevant row and column . then , since correct decryption must be possible and @xmath33 , each ciphertext appears exactly once in each row .",
    "fix any ciphertext @xmath34 , and let @xmath35 be the number of times @xmath34 appears in , say , the first column . since the probability distribution of the ciphertext must be the same no matter the plaintext",
    ", @xmath34 must appear @xmath35 times in every column .",
    "since it also appears in every row , it follows that the length of a column satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "so @xmath37 is the same for every @xmath34 .",
    "if we know a matching plaintext / ciphertext pair , we are given some @xmath34 and a column , and all we know is that the key corresponds to one of the @xmath35 possible rows .",
    "the proposition follows .    for any classical @xmath24-cipher ,",
    "both the shannon- and min - entropy key - uncertainty is @xmath38 bits .",
    "this result shows that there is no room for improvement in classical schemes : the natural constraints on @xmath24-ciphers imply that the key - uncertainty is always the same , once we fix @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "as we shall see , this is not true for quantum ciphers .",
    "although they can not do better in terms of min - entropy key uncertainty , they can when it comes to shannon key - uncertainty .",
    "in this section , we consider quantum ciphers which encrypt classical messages using classical keys and produce quantum ciphers .",
    "we model both the encryption and decryption processes by unitary operations on the plaintext possibly together with an ancilla .",
    "this is the same model as used in @xcite , with the restriction that we only encrypt classical messages .",
    "a _ general @xmath24-quantum cipher _ is a tuple @xmath39 , such that    * @xmath40 is a finite set of orthonormal pure - states ( plaintexts ) in the hilbert space @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "* @xmath44 is a set of unitary operators ( encryptions ) , and @xmath45 .",
    "decryption using key @xmath46 is performed using @xmath47 .    and",
    "the following properties hold :    * key hiding : @xmath48 , @xmath49 * data hiding : @xmath50 , @xmath51    the key and data hiding properties guarantee that an adversary can not gain any information about the key and message respectively when an arbitrary ciphertext is seen . in @xcite , it was shown that data hiding implies that @xmath52 .    the key hiding property states that an adversary with no information on the message encrypted expects to see the same ensemble no matter what key was used .",
    "we denote this ensemble @xmath53 for any @xmath54 . as motivation for the key - hiding property",
    ", we mention that it is always satisfied if ciphertexts are as short as possible ( @xmath55 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the key - hiding property does not hold then the cipher - state on its own reveals information about the secret - key .",
    "this is certainly an unnecessary weakness that one should avoid when designing ciphers .    the data hiding property states that the adversary expects to see the same ensemble no matter what message was encrypted .",

    "we are now ready to prove that for any @xmath24-quantum cipher there exists a measurement that returns the secret key with probability @xmath62 given any plaintext and its associated cipher - state . in other words and similarly to the classical case , the min - entropy key - uncertainty of any @xmath24-quantum cipher is at most @xmath38 .",

    "lemma [ lemma : minentropy ] gives @xmath68    since the plaintexts are orthogonal quantum states , and since unitary operators preserve angles , we have that @xmath69 is the eigen decomposition of @xmath70 , and that @xmath7 is the only eigenvalue .",
    "therefore there exists a positive operator @xmath71 such that @xmath72 , and thus @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( and therefore also @xmath75 ) is a valid povm .",
    "the probability of identifying the key with the measurement @xmath75 is @xmath76 which proves the theorem .",
    "in this section , we suggest a general method for designing quantum ciphers that can do better in terms of shannon key - uncertainty than any classical cipher with the same parameters .",
    "the properties of our ciphers are analyzed in the next section .",
    "the first example is extremely simple :    the @xmath77 cipher is an @xmath78-quantum cipher . given message @xmath79 and key @xmath80 , it outputs the following @xmath0 q - bit state as ciphertext : @xmath81 where @xmath14 is the bit - flip operator and @xmath82 is the hadamard transform . that is",
    ", we use the last @xmath0 bits of key as a one - time pad , and the first key bit determines whether or not we do a hadamard transform on all @xmath0 resulting q - bits .",
    "decryption is trivial by observing that the operator @xmath83 is the inverse of the encryption operator .",
    "it is also easy to see that the data hiding property is satisfied : if @xmath80 are uniformly random , then the encryption of any message produces the complete mixture ( in fact this would be the case , already if only @xmath84 were uniformly random ) .    this cipher can be described from a more general point of view : let @xmath85 be a set of @xmath86 orthonormal bases for the hilbert space of dimension @xmath87 .",
    "we require that the bases do not overlap , i.e. , no unit vector occurs in more than one basis .",
    "for instance @xmath88 could consist of the computational basis and the diagonal basis ( i.e. @xmath89 ) .",

    "the lemma holds even if @xmath88 contains only the computational basis , in which case @xmath95 is equivalent to the classical one - time pad .",
    "the point of having several bases is that if they are well chosen , this may create additional confusion for the adversary , so that he will not learn full information on the key , even knowing the plaintext .",
    "we shall see this below .    for now , we note that wootters and fields have shown that in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath87 , there exists @xmath101 orthonormal bases that are _ mutually unbiased _",

    "but actually , this scenario is quite general and not tied to the cryptographic application : what we want to answer is : given a ( pure ) state chosen uniformly from a given set of states , how much shannon entropy must ( at least ) remain on the choice of state after having made a measurement that is optimal w.r.t . minimizing the entropy ?",
    "so what we should consider is the following experiment : choose a key @xmath131 uniformly .",

    "this is because the elements of any povm can be split in a sum of scaled projections , leading to a measurement with more outcomes which can not yield less information than the original one .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath144 note that also the factor @xmath145 does not depend on @xmath46 .",

    "the largest value we could hope for @xmath157 is @xmath174 bits , since this value is exactly matched when the state measured is a state that belongs to a basis in @xmath130 .",

    "the shannon key - uncertainty of @xmath104 is at least @xmath181 .",
    "conjecture [ conj1 ] leads to @xmath182 .",
    "the result follows .",
    "the @xmath77 and @xmath104-ciphers represent two extremes , using the minimal non - trivial number of bases , respectively as many of the known mutually unbiased bases as we can address with an integral number of key bits .",
    "it is not hard to define example ciphers that are `` in between '' and prove results on their key - uncertainty using the same techniques as for @xmath104 .",

    "what happens to the key uncertainty if we use a quantum cipher twice to encrypt two plaintext blocks , using independently chosen keys ?",
    "intuition based on classical behavior suggests that the key uncertainty should now be twice that of a single application of the cipher , since the keys are independent .",
    "but in the quantum case , this requires proof : the adversary will be measuring a product state composed of of two ciphertext blocks .",
    "if the adversary was to measure each block individually then clearly the key uncertainty would be twice the key uncertainty of a single block .",
    "however , coherent measurements involving both blocks simultaneously may provide more information on the key than what is achievable by measuring the blocks individually .    in the following , we consider composition of the cipher @xmath95 with itself , where @xmath88 consists of @xmath86 bases for a space of dimension @xmath87 .",
    "this is a @xmath183-cipher which we call @xmath184 .",
    "say @xmath185 consists of the bases @xmath186 .",
    "let us consider the tensor product of two hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath87 each .",
    "then @xmath187 denotes the basis of this tensor product space that one obtains by taking all pairwise tensor products of the @xmath87 basis vectors in each of @xmath91 and @xmath163",
    ". we will let @xmath188 denote the set of all @xmath189 bases that can be formed this way .",
    "since each such basis consists of @xmath190 basis vectors , @xmath188 can also be thought of as a collection of @xmath191 pure states .    on the adversary s point of view , determining the two @xmath192-bit keys from two ciphertext blocks is equivalent to the following experiment : choose uniformly a state in @xmath188 , now the adversary wants to make a measurement that minimizes the uncertainty about the state that was picked .    to study this question ,",
    "we split @xmath188 in subsets : let @xmath193 be the set of @xmath86 bases defined by @xmath194 it is now easy to see that @xmath188 is the disjoint union of the @xmath193 s , for @xmath195 .",
    "now , the choice of a state in @xmath188 can be rephrased as follows : choose @xmath116 uniformly from @xmath196 $ ] , and then choose a state uniformly from @xmath193 .",
    "let @xmath197 be random variables representing these choices , and let @xmath198 be the random variable representing the adversary s measurement result .",
    "standard properties of shannon entropy give : @xmath199    it is straightforward to see that a uniform mixture over all @xmath200 states in @xmath193 is in fact the complete mixture , and so has the same density matrix for any @xmath116 , hence no measurement can reveal information on @xmath201 and we have @xmath202 .",
    "we define @xmath203 .",
    "then , using exactly the same line of argument as for lemma [ uncertainty ] , one finds that for each particular value of @xmath116 , we have @xmath204 and hence @xmath205 . putting things together gives ,    @xmath184 has shannon key - uncertainty at least @xmath206 .    considering composition of @xmath95 @xmath207 times with itself ,",
    "denoted @xmath208 , the techniques above extend in a straightforward way . in particular , we end up defining a minimum @xmath209 over entropy sums for a generalization of the @xmath210 s .",
    "this leads to ,    [ cvb ] @xmath208 has shannon key - uncertainty at least @xmath211 .",
    "note that by the construction defined in ( [ bi ] ) , each @xmath193 is a set of mutually unbiased bases , and this holds also for any of the @xmath207-wise generalizations . in the special case of @xmath77 , we have @xmath212 , and each @xmath193 ( as well as its @xmath207-wise generalization ) contains 2 mutually unbiased bases .",
    "lemma [ cvb ] together with the result of @xcite ( i.e. which in our notation reads @xmath213 ) immediately implies ,    the cipher @xmath214 has shannon key uncertainty @xmath215 bits .",
    "we do not know of any strong results on the minimal entropy sum for any set of mutually unbiased bases except when its cardinality is 2@xcite or is close to the dimension of the space@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can not prove a good lower bound on the shannon key - uncertainty for the composition of @xmath104 .",
    "already for @xmath216 , we need to consider a set of @xmath87 mutually unbiased bases living in a space of dimension @xmath190 . using the notation of the previous section ,",
    "we need to bound @xmath217 , or more generally @xmath218 .",
    "while @xmath219 may be too much to hope for , it seems reasonable to conjecture a result similar to the one we know for @xmath220 :    [ conj2 ] for any set @xmath88 of @xmath87 mutually unbiased bases living in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath221 , it holds that @xmath222 .",
    "we then have ,    [ lemmawn ] under conjecture [ conj2 ] , @xmath223 has shannon key - uncertainty at least @xmath224 bits .",
    "we can use the quantum ciphers we just described to build a ( computationally secure ) quantum stream - cipher using a short key @xmath225 of length independent from the message length .",
    "in fact , any @xmath24-cipher and classical pseudorandom generator can be used : we seed the generator with key @xmath225 , and use its output as a keystream . to encrypt , we simply take the next @xmath1 bits from the keystream and use these as key in the cipher to encrypt the next @xmath0 bits of the plaintext .",
    "since an @xmath24-cipher has perfect security , this construction would have perfect security as well if the keystream was genuinely random . by a standard reduction",
    ", this implies that breaking it is at least as hard as distinguishing the output of the generator from a truly random string .",
    "all this is true whether we use a classical or an @xmath24-quantum cipher .",
    "however , by our results on shannon key - uncertainty , the adversary is in a potentially much harder situation in the quantum case . for intuition on this",
    ", we refer to the discussion in the introduction . as a more concrete illustration , we consider the following scenario :    1 .",
    "we have a pseudorandom generator @xmath226 , expanding a @xmath46-bit seed @xmath225 into an @xmath167-bit sequence @xmath227 .",
    "furthermore , any subset containing at most @xmath228 bits of @xmath227 is uniformly random .",
    "finally , no polynomial time ( in @xmath46 ) classical algorithm can with non - negligible advantage distinguish @xmath227 from a truly random sequence when given any piece of data that is generated from @xmath227 and contains at most @xmath229 bits of shannon information on @xmath227 . both @xmath228 and @xmath229",
    "are assumed to be polynomial in @xmath46.[a1 ] 2 .",
    "coherent measurements simultaneously involving @xmath230 qubits or more are not possible to implement in practice .",
    "however , technology has advanced so that the @xmath231-cipher can be implemented for some @xmath232.[a2 ] 3 .",
    "we will consider an adversary that first obtains some amount of known plaintext .",
    "given the plaintext , he decides on a number of complete measurements that he executes on parts of the ciphertext ( under the constraints of assumption 2 ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that each measurement involves an integral number of @xmath0-bit ciphertext blocks . using a more complicated argument and",
    "provided the local randomness of the generator is expanded from @xmath228 to @xmath233 finally he executes any polynomial time classical algorithm to analyze the results.[a3 ]    the first assumption can be justified using a result by maurer and massey @xcite on locally random pseudorandom generators .",
    "their result asserts that there exists pseudorandom generators satisfying the assumption that any @xmath228 bits are genuinely random , provided @xmath234 .",
    "their generators may not behave well against attacks having access to more than @xmath228 bits of the sequence , but one can always xor the output from their generator with the output of a more conventional one using an independent key .",
    "this will preserve the local randomness .",
    "note that the size of @xmath46 does not influence the size of the quantum computer required for the honest party to encrypt or decrypt .",
    "the third assumption essentially says that we do not expect that results of ( incomplete ) measurements obtained on one part of the ciphertext will help significantly in designing measurements on other parts .",
    "this is justified , as long as not too many measurements are performed : as long as results from previous measurements contain less than @xmath229 bits of information on the keystream , then by assumption [ a1 ] , these results might ( from the adversary s point of view ) as well have been generated from measuring a random source , and so they do not help in designing the next measurement .",
    "this assumption can therefore be dropped in a more careful analysis since it esssentially follows from assumptions [ a1 ] and [ a2 ] . for simplicity , we choose to make it explicit .",
    "[ awn ] assume we apply the @xmath104-cipher for stream encryption using a pseudorandom generator and with an adversary as defined by assumptions [ a1],[a2 ] , and [ a3 ] above .",
    "suppose we choose @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "then , assuming conjecture [ conj2 ] , the adversary will need to obtain @xmath237 bits of known plaintext , in order to distinguish the case of a real encryption from the case where the keystream is random .",
    "assume the prg satisfies assumption [ a1 ] which is possible since @xmath238 .",
    "by assumption [ a2 ] , any attack that measures several blocks of ciphertext in one coherent measurement can handle at most @xmath239 qubits at any one time . by construction , this ciphertext was created using less than @xmath228 bits of the keystream , which is random by assumption [ a1 ] .",
    "therefore , the measurement will give the same result as when attacking the composition @xmath240 since the measurement involves @xmath241 qubits ( since different blocks of the keystream are independent if the stream is truly random ) and by assumption [ a3 ] .",
    "hence , by lemma [ lemmawn ] and under conjecture [ conj2 ] , the adversary learns less than @xmath7 bit of information on the key stream from each measurement .",
    "now , if the adversary has @xmath242 bits of known plaintext , and hence measures @xmath242 ciphertext bits , the maximal number of measurements that can take place is @xmath243 so he needs to have @xmath244 in order for the classical distinguisher to work , by assumption [ a1 ] .",
    "the lemma follows .",
    "this lemma essentially says that for a generator with the right properties , and for an adversary constrained as we have assumed , quantum communication allows using the generator securely to encrypt @xmath237 bits , rather than the @xmath229 bits we would have in the classical case .",
    "depending on how close the actual key uncertainty of compositions of @xmath104 is to the maximal value , the number of required plaintext bits can be much larger .",
    "the best we can hope for would be if @xmath219 for all @xmath245 , in which case the adversary would need @xmath246 plaintext bits .",
    "a similar result can be shown without assuming any conjecture for the @xmath77 cipher . in this case , we gain essentially a factor 2 in plaintext size over the classical case .",
    "of course , these results do not allow to handle adversaries as general as we would like , our constraints are different from just assuming the adversary is quantum polynomial time . nevertheless , we believe that the scenario we have described can be reasonable with technology available in the foreseeable future",
    ". moreover , it seems to us that quantum communication should help even for more general adversaries and generators .",
    "quantifying this advantage is an open problem .",
    "we have seen that , despite the fact that quantum communication can not help to provide perfect security with shorter keys when only one - way communication is used , there are fundamental differences between classical and quantum ciphers with perfect security , in particular the shannon key uncertainty can be much larger in the quantum case . however , the min - entropy key - uncertainty is the same in the two cases .",
    "it is an open question whether encryption performed by general quantum operations allows for quantum ciphers to have more min - entropy key - uncertainty than classical ones .",
    "we have also seen an application of the results on shannon key uncertainty to some example quantum ciphers that could be used to construct a quantum stream - cipher where , under a known plaintext attack , a resource - bounded adversary would be in a potentially much worse situation than with any classical stream - cipher with the same parameters .    for the ciphers we presented ,",
    "the shannon key - uncertainty is known exactly for the @xmath77-cipher but not for the @xmath104-cipher .",
    "it is an interesting open question to determine it .",
