    "spin - orbit coupling @xcite plays a vital role in several physical properties of various systems because it breaks the spin degeneracy even at zero magnetic field .",
    "there are mainly two kinds of spin - orbit interaction in condensed matter systems , namely rashba spin - orbit coupling due to inversion asymmetry of the confining potential @xcite and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling generated by the asymmetry of the host bulk crystals @xcite .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling has been realized in various systems such as zincblende semiconductor quantum wells @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , two - dimensional materials @xcite , and neutral atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) is essential in controlling the spin degree of freedom of the charge carrier in spin - based devices . in most of the studies systems with @xmath0-linear rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions(rsoi and dsoi )",
    "are of much interest .",
    "however higher order momentum - dependent spin - orbit interactions have also been seen to dominate in many physical systems . for example , @xmath0-cubic rsoi dominates in two - dimensional heavy - hole gas formed at the p - type gaas / algaas heterostructure @xcite , in two - dimensional electron gas formed at the surface of the inversion symmetric oxide srtio@xmath1 @xcite and in strained ge / sige quantum wells @xcite .",
    "the optical conductivity is due to the transitions from one energy level to another energy level , whereas the zero - frequency drude weight is associated with the intra - level transitions . the real part of the complex frequency - dependent longitudinal optical conductivity provides the absorption as a function of photon energy .",
    "its measurement through optical spectroscopy is an important tool for probing shape of the spin - split energy levels",
    ". typical order of the spin - split energy is the same as that of an electromagnetic radiation with terahertz ( thz ) frequency .",
    "the high - frequency radiation plays an important role to control the spinors of the spin - split energy levels due to the sois .",
    "optical response studies will be useful for the high - speed electronic devices since the radiation with thz frequency flips the spin in a very short time .",
    "it opens the possibility of seeing the resonance effects through the optical transition between spin - split levels and leads to unique spectral features .",
    "several theoretical studies of the optical conductivity have been carried out on spin - orbit coupled electron systems formed at the semiconductor heterojunctions @xcite as well as in @xmath2 bands of an oxide with perovskite structure @xcite . the optical spectrum of hole gas with @xmath0-cubic rsoi has been studied @xcite partially .",

    "the drude weight is strongly modified due to the presence of the @xmath0-cubic spin - orbit couplings .",
    "we obtain an analytical expression of the drude weight when only the @xmath0-cubic rsoi is present .",
    "it deviates from the linear density dependence for large hole density and for strong spin - orbit couplings .",
    "it decreases with the increase of the spin - orbit couplings .",
    "we show that the optical conductivity is directly related to the berry connection and does not vanish even for equal strength of the two spin - orbit couplings .",
    "the minimum photon energy required for the onset of the optical transition in hole gas is one order of magnitude smaller than that of electron gas .",
    "we also identify the nature of the two van hove singularities appear in the optical spectrum .",
    "we organise this paper as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present basic ground state properties of the heavy - hole system with the @xmath0-cubic rsoi and dsoi . in section iii , we present the effect of spin - orbit interactions on the drude weight and study various aspects of the optical conductivity for the same system at zero as well as non - zero temperature . types of the van hove singularities are tabulated in this section . a summary of our main results are provided in section iv .",

    "<S> we explicitly show that the optical conductivity does not vanish even for equal strength of the two spin - orbit couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this fact to the non - zero berry phase for equal strength of @xmath0-cubic spin - orbit couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the least photon energy needed to set in the optical transition in hole gas is one order of magnitude smaller than that of electron gas . </S>",
