    "<S> compared to the highest rhic energies the multiplicity of charged particles in central collisions increased by a factor @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , the production of particles with soft momenta can be described using the relativistic hydrodynamic model . a satisfactory description of the measured hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) radii requires the use of an equation of state without a soft point at the transition from the quark - gluon plasma to the hadronic phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is consistent with lattice qcd calculations of the equation of state showing a crossover transition @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    we apply @xmath6 dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics with shear and bulk viscosities to model the collision dynamics at @xmath1gev . </S>",
    "<S> the shear viscosity is fixed to the ads / cft value @xmath0 , while the bulk viscosity is set to @xmath7 , in the hadronic phase . </S>",
    "<S> second order viscous hydrodynamic equations @xcite are solved and hadrons are emitted at the freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations from the equilibrium momentum distributions at freeze - out are implemented using a quadratic and an asymptotically linear ansatz in momentum for the shear and bulk viscosity corrections respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an exponential ansatz for the bulk viscosity corrections leads to similar results as the linear one . </S>",
    "<S> the initial entropy density profile of the fireball is proportional to a mixture of participant and binary collisions densities @xmath8 with @xmath9 , fixed to reproduce the measured centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity @xcite .        the elliptic flow coefficient of charged particles @xmath10 is calculated for collisions at different centralities . </S>",
    "<S> it is significant that the elliptic flow at such very different collision energies can be described in a satisfactory way using the same viscosity coefficients and the same equation of state ( fig [ fig : v2ch ] ) . assuming glauber model initial conditions , the shear viscosity coefficient that describes the data is small , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> other studies of the elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions at the lhc show that the fluid has a small viscosity @xcite @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the elliptic flow created in central and semi - central collisions is well described within viscious hydrodynamics with a constant value of @xmath12 , there is no sign of a change of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio for higher temperatures reached at the lhc .    </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    the measured elliptic flow as function of the transverse momentum shows systematic deviations from the predictions of the hydrodynamic model ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2pt ] , left panel ) . at high transverse momenta , such deviations </S>",
    "<S> are expected , as the majority of particles emitted at few gev s originate from jets . however , the data points at low momenta deviate from the hydrodynamic calculation as well . </S>",
    "<S> if this effect is not a systematic experimental bias , it could mean that a substantial contribution from non - thermalized remnants of jets is present ; the elliptic flow from jets is of a geometrical origin and could be larger than the one from the collective hydrodynamic flow at low momenta @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the elliptic flow of identified particles shows a stronger mass splitting at the highest energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is due to a stronger flow , which makes the corrections from bulk viscosity more important . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in order to get the mass splitting correctly in a model without a hadronic cascade after - burner a realistic non - zero bulk viscosity in the hadronic stage must be taken @xcite .    the strong transverse flow generated in the expansion of the hot fireball leads to flatter transverse momentum spectra at the lhc than at rhic ( fig . [ fig : hbt ] , left panel ) @xcite . the inclusion of the pre - equilibrium flow @xcite makes the spectra harder , especially at rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> the hbt radii can be described to within @xmath13% . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the pre - equilibrium flow is small at @xmath1tev , but improves slightly the agreement with the data at @xmath3gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar quality in the data description is achieved in some earlier calculations using ideal fluid hydrodynamics @xcite , especially when using modified profiles of the fireball or initial flow . for collisions at the lhc , the hydrodynamic stage in the expansion dominates and the pre - equilibrium flow ( if present ) is relatively less important . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the preliminary transverse momentum spectra of pions , kaons and protons presented by the alice collaboration at this conference can be described by the calculation without initial flow .    </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of a viscous hydrodynamic model for pb - pb collisions at @xmath1tev . a simultaneous description of the transverse momentum spectra , elliptic flow and hbt radii is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that relativistic hydrodynamics is a reasonable model of the expansion of the fireball and of the production of the bulk of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the model : the equation of state , the viscosity coefficients , the initial time and the freeze - out temperature are the same as deduced from the analysis of rhic data . in particular , for glauber model initial densities it means that @xmath0 ; an almost perfect fluid is produced in heavy - ion collisions at the lhc . </S>"
