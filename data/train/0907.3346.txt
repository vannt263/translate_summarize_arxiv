    "the chromospheric emission component of the k line has been studied extensively in the optical spectra of giant stars ( e.g. , wilson 1976 , blanco et al .",
    "1976 , stencel 1978 , kelch et al . 1978 , gray 1980 , middelkoop & zwaan 1981 , middelkoop 1982 , rutten 1984 ) .",
    "the h line has not been used as often to probe the stellar atmosphere , though both lines exhibit emission in their cores that typically has a double - peaked profile . in the h line ,",
    "the violet- and red - side emission peaks can be labeled h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 respectively . a re - absorption feature denoted h@xmath7",
    "is located at the core of the emission profile , and is produced higher in the chromosphere .",
    "the h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 peaks often do not have equal strength . to quantify this asymmetry ,",
    "it is convenient to use the @xmath0 parameter of wilson ( 1976 ) and stencel ( 1978 ) , which we define as the ratio of intensities in the h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 emission peaks .",
    "asymmetric emission profiles with @xmath0 values less than unity can be interpreted as evidence for an outflow having a differential velocity field in the chromospheric region , with the h@xmath7 absorption feature being blueshifted with respect to the emission profile ( stencel 1978 ) .",
    "it is possible that the h line probes a different level of the stellar chromosphere than the k line , depending upon the mechanism for setting the relative populations in the upper states of these transitions ( e.g. , avrett 1966 ; linsky 1970 ) . with the greater opacity of the k",
    "line leading to formation at higher altitudes , these emission lines can potentially be used to probe the onset of mass outflows within two different layers of the chromosphere .    in this paper",
    "we report the results from a spectroscopic program to measure the @xmath0 parameter of the h line for a sample of red giant stars .",
    "the asymmetry of the h emission profile is compared to that of the k line .",
    "our study uses spectra of 105 red giants observed during a ten - year period , and includes 98 stars previously investigated by smith & shetrone ( 2000 , 2004 ) and shetrone et al .",
    "the sample covers a range of stellar colors and luminosities in an effort to map out the behavior of the h emission as a function of location in the h - r diagram .",
    "in addition , multiple observations were obtained for a number of stars .",
    "variability of the k emission line profile based on our data set has been discussed by shetrone et al .",
    "although time variability is not the intended subject of this paper , the individual observations listed in table 1 allow an interested reader to judge the degree to which the h line asymmetry can vary on a timescale of months .",
    "high resolution spectra of the h and k lines for a sample of 105 field giants were obtained at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the spectra were acquired during several observing runs between october 1998 and june 2008 using either the sandiford cassegrain echelle ( ce ) spectrometer on the 2.1-m otto struve telescope or the 2d - coud spectrometer on the 2.7-m harlan j. smith telescope . for the 2.7-m we used a 1.2 `` slit which yielded a 2.0 pixel resolution of @xmath8 . for the 2.1-m we used a 1.1 '' slit which yielded a 2.0 pixel resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "this paper examines the h line found in a different order of the same echelle spectra for which k line observations have been reported upon by smith & shetrone ( 2000 , 2004 ) and shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . to this material",
    "we add more recent h and k line data from the spectra obtained in june 2008 .",
    "the observing procedure and data reduction process for the spectra obtained during observing runs from october 1998 through august 2007 are described in smith & shetrone ( 2000 , 2004 ) and shetrone et al .",
    "the most recent data were taken during the nights of 2008 june 22 and 23 using the 2d - coud spectrometer on the 2.7-m telescope .",
    "for this later run , the observing procedure was to take at least three exposures of each object with the maximum exposure time being 1200 s. bias frames and flat field frames were taken at the end of each night . in the case of the 2.1-m program , since the spectrometer is a cassegrain instrument , exposures of thar arcs were made before and after observation of each star . by contrast , the 2d - coud spectrometer of the 2.7-m telescope is very stable , and for the observing runs with this instrument , thar arcs were generally obtained only at the start and end of each night .",
    "the spectra were bias corrected , flat - field corrected , and wavelength calibrated using routines within the iraf * echelle * package .",
    "the individual spectra for each object taken on a given night were combined to remove cosmic rays . during the data reduction process",
    ", the number of observed electrons was preserved to keep the poisson statistics valid for all coadded spectra .    using the iraf * fxcor * and * dopcor * packages ,",
    "the spectra were shifted to the velocity frame of the hinkle spectral atlas of arcturus ( hinkle et al .",
    "the spectra were then divided by the arcturus atlas to obtain a continuum residual , which was fit by a low order legendre polynomial , excluding the core of the h line in the fitted sample .",
    "the combined spectra were divided by the continuum fit to obtain normalized spectra .",
    "this normalization procedure matches the procedures found in smith & shetrone ( 2004 ) and shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . the original spectrum , before continuum normalization , was also saved and referenced to determine the poisson noise .",
    "our sample is comprised of 105 giants that show double - peaked h and k emission lines in their spectra .",
    "the stars observed are listed in table 1 along with each date on which they were observed and the @xmath1 value for the h emission feature .",
    "the error ( denoted @xmath10 ) on each @xmath1 value is calculated from the relation @xmath11 , as described in shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in this equation ,",
    "the recorded photon counts in the h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 peaks of the unnormalized spectra are represented by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "taking the square root of @xmath12 and @xmath13 gives the poisson errors in these counts , denoted @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the possible effects of using a different template spectrum other than the arcturus atlas for the normalization procedure were explored using synthetic spectra .",
    "model red giant spectra ( normalized to their continua ) were computed for effective temperatures of @xmath16 3800 , 4130 , 4540 , and 5250 k , which span the range in temperature encompassed by the stars in our sample .",
    "mismatches in spectral type associated with using these templates in the normalization of the observed spectra were found to introduce possible systematic effects in derived @xmath17 values on the level of @xmath18 , which is relatively small compared to uncertainties due to photon - statistics ( see table 1 ) . for the random errors associated with the normalization process , which vary according to where the fitting points are set outside the h and k lines , the errors are typically 0.007 on @xmath19 and 0.003 on @xmath1 , which are again considerably smaller than poisson noise in the photon counts . while the exact template used for normalization is not critical , it is important that the normalization be done . a test of the @xmath17 values in the unnormalized spectra revealed differences of 0.02 to 0.05 for the @xmath1 depending upon the color of the star .",
    "as noted , we have simultaneous spectra of the k emission line for each h - line observation listed in table 1 , these two features falling in different echelle orders of the same ccd exposure .",
    "the @xmath19 value of the k emission feature for each observation , and its error @xmath20 , are also reported in table 1 .",
    "these values were taken from smith & shetrone ( 2004 ) and shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , with the exception of the june 2008 measurements .",
    "several @xmath21 values were taken from smith & shetrone ( 2000 ) and adjusted with a zero point offset of @xmath22 to correct for differences between normalization procedures , as described in shetrone et al .",
    "the smith & shetrone ( 2000 , 2004 ) papers did not include errors in the @xmath19 data . to estimate these we first determined an average difference between the errors in @xmath1 and @xmath19 from the shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) data and the h analysis done here .",
    "this average difference , @xmath23 , is 0.005 .",
    "this offset was applied to the @xmath10 values derived from our analysis of the older h line spectra to estimate corresponding values of @xmath20 .",
    "these new @xmath20 error estimates , the @xmath20 errors from shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and the @xmath10 errors from this analysis are listed in table 1 .",
    "photometry in the johnson @xmath24 system was taken from the general catalogue of photometric data ( gcpd ; mermilliod et al .",
    "1997 ) , accessed from an online catalog . the @xmath2 color of each star , as well as the absolute visual magnitude derived from hipparcos parallaxes ( assuming zero interstellar absorption ) , are listed in table 2 .",
    "the parallaxes were tabulated in the earlier papers of smith & shetrone ( 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "the distance range among most of the stars in our sample is 20 - 200 pc , with 9 stars of known parallax being beyond 200 pc .",
    "also listed in table 2 is the heliocentric radial velocity @xmath25 as obtained from the simbad database and the metallicity from mcwilliam ( 1990 ) of each star .",
    "these properties are all consistent with our sample being population i giants .    in figure 1",
    "the asymmetry @xmath1 of the h line is plotted versus the @xmath2 color of each star . in cases of stars",
    "observed multiple times , each observation is plotted separately , and consequently this diagram contains the effects of any time variability in the h line asymmetry . with the exception of one observation of hd 203387 , only stars with @xmath26 exhibit red - dominant asymmetry where @xmath27 .",
    "the most extreme red asymmetries where @xmath28 are only seen in stars with @xmath29 .",
    "figure 1 can be compared to figure 2 from shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which gives an analogous plot for the asymmetry parameter of the k line .",
    "both plots illustrate two groupings of data points spanning similar asymmetry and color ranges : one in the region @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the other with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "however , data for giants redder than @xmath34 are unique to figure 1 , which represents a more diverse sample of stars than that in shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "stellar h and k emission line profiles can be affected by absorption in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "although we do not have spectra of the interstellar lines in the directions of our program stars , several types of evidence indicate that the asymmetry trends seen in the @xmath17 data are not attributable to systematic interstellar corruption of the stellar lines .",
    "if interstellar absorption was dominating the observed @xmath17 values then the sense of the asymmetry should correlate with the velocity of each star relative to the ism ( as in figure 5 of bhm - vitense 1981 for the @xmath35 emission ) .",
    "several diagrams were prepared to test whether a similar correlation is present in the data .",
    "plots were made of the average @xmath19 and average ( @xmath36 values of each star versus heliocentric radial velocity @xmath25 ; no trend is seen ( figure 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , a version of figure 1 was made using different symbols to depict stars in different radial velocity ranges : @xmath37 km s@xmath38 , @xmath39 km s@xmath38 , and @xmath40 km s@xmath38 .",
    "there is no evidence that stars with positive or negative @xmath25 occupy systematically different regions of the diagram .",
    "we conclude that the emission lines are more resilient to ism corruption than found by bhm - vitense ( 1981 ) for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 emission .    as a second test ,",
    "the ism absorption @xmath43 towards most program stars was calculated using the numerical recipe of hakkila et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which takes into account both the distance to each star and the galactocentric coordinates of each star .",
    "many of the stars from table 1 are within 75 pc of the sun , and within a local bubble inside of which ism extinction is considered to be small or negligible ( e.g. , sfeir et al .",
    "1999 ; luck & heiter 2007 ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the interstellar k line as seen against early - type stars within 100 pc of the sun tends to be less than 10 m  ( e.g. , vallerga et al . 1993 ) , although exceptions occur .",
    "the values of @xmath43 derived according to the hakkila et al .",
    "( 1997 ) model , modified such that @xmath43 is set to zero within 75 pc , are listed in table 2 . for the majority of program stars , the estimated @xmath44 mag .",
    "furthermore , those stars with the largest values of @xmath43 do not occupy systematically discordant positions in the h and k line @xmath17 versus @xmath45 diagrams . in summary , considering both the radial velocities of the program stars , and the estimated interstellar extinction towards them , we see no systematics of the type that would be expected if ism corruption of the h and k emission profiles was governing the observed @xmath17 values .",
    "despite the similarities between figure 1 of this paper and figure 2 of shetrone et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , there are nonetheless differences between @xmath1 and @xmath19 for many stars . some illustrative examples of asymmetry differences are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the first of these shows spectra of hd 156283 obtained on 22 june 2008 using the 2.7-m telescope , wherein the @xmath19 ratio is @xmath46 and @xmath1 is @xmath47 . at this time , although the k emission line was nearly symmetrical , the h line showed a blue - enhanced asymmetry in which the violet h@xmath5 peak was stronger than the red peak .",
    "figure 4 shows a spectrum of hd 21552 obtained on 3 october 2001 using the 2.1-m telescope .",
    "the @xmath19 ratio for this spectrum is @xmath48 while @xmath49 . in this case , although the h line is nearly symmetric , the k emission profile is stronger in the red peak .",
    "the difference between the h and k line @xmath0 values was calculated for every observation of each star in the sample .",
    "the resulting set of difference values is plotted versus the h line @xmath1 in figure 5 ; each observation of each star is plotted , so some stars are represented by multiple points .",
    "the error bars were calculated by summing @xmath10 and @xmath20 in quadrature .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is larger than @xmath19 by an average offset of @xmath50 , which is shown as a dashed line in figure 5 .",
    "however , it can be seen that there are trends within this diagram , such that a single average offset is not a good fit to the entire data set .",
    "the difference between the h and k line @xmath0 values are shown in figure 6 versus @xmath2 color . as with figure 5 ,",
    "asymmetry values from individual spectra are plotted , so that some stars are depicted with multiple data points .",
    "the linear best fit to the data is plotted as a dashed line , which has a slope of @xmath51 . however",
    ", this fit does not seem to be the best representation of the data . in order to smooth over possible intrinsic variability",
    ", an average of the @xmath52 values was calculated for each star .",
    "these averages are shown plotted versus @xmath2 in figure 7 , so that unlike figure 6 , each star is depicted by just one data point . in order to further smooth the data to look for trends , a weighted mean was made of every five points in figure 7 binned according to @xmath2 .",
    "a continuous line shows the locus of these binned averages . rather than a linear relation , these binned data exhibit a quasi - step function with a reasonably abrupt change at @xmath53 .",
    "the two horizontal lines in the figure show the average value of the asymmetry difference among giants with colors on either side of this `` divide . ''",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for our sample of red giants is plotted in figure 8 .",
    "the data points are coded according to the significance level of the @xmath52 values ; open circles and open squares represent stars for which the average asymmetries differences are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , while filled triangles represent stars for which @xmath56 .",
    "red giants for which @xmath17 is notably greater in the h line than the k line ( open circles ) tend to have colors of @xmath57 , while stars for which the reverse is the case ( open boxes ) are mainly of @xmath58 , although they do extend as red as @xmath59 .",
    "giants with similar h and k line asymmetries ( filled triangles ) are evenly spread across the entire @xmath2 range covered by the data sample .",
    "thus , stars with similar asymmetry differences tend to group in specific regions of the color - magnitude diagram , albeit with some overlap , particularly in the color range @xmath60 .",
    "this is a further reflection of the trend seen in figure 6 .",
    "the h and k line chromospheric emission components are superimposed on a photospheric absorption spectrum that varies with both wavelength and effective temperature .",
    "could the differences between @xmath61 and @xmath62 be due to differences in the background photospheric spectrum in the vicinity of the h and k lines ?",
    "we have investigated this question through the use of synthetic photospheric spectra calculated using the 2007 version of the program moog ( sneden 1973 ) .",
    "these spectra were generated for a model atmosphere with @xmath63 k , @xmath64 , and [ fe / h ] = 0.1 , a combination of parameters that is typical of the red giants in our sample .",
    "synthetic photospheric spectra were generated for three linelists : one with all of the photosphere lines , a second list from which the h and k lines had been removed , and a third that contained only the h and k lines . to simulate a symmetric double - peaked h or k emission feature ,",
    "two equal - height gaussian profiles were combined having separations in wavelength that are typical of the observed spectra . in accordance with the optically thin case ,",
    "the relative strengths of these h and k emission profiles were set to be 1:2 , with the peak flux in the k emission being 15% that of the continuum level of the photospheric spectrum on which it is superimposed .",
    "mathematically , the flux of these artificial peaks was simply added to the synthetic photospheric spectrum computed with the full line list .",
    "a decomposition of the resultant model spectrum is presented in the various panels of figure 9 , which show from top to bottom : the h and k photospheric lines alone , all photospheric lines other than h and k , the complete photospheric spectrum , the artificial h and k emission profiles , and the full photospheric spectrum plus the artificial emission lines .",
    "there are numerous weak and moderate strength absorption lines throughout the wavelength range @xmath65  , but once they get superimposed on the very broad and deep photospheric profiles of the h and k lines , the amplitudes of these weaker lines are greatly reduced .",
    "since the total photospheric flux in the cores of these lines is relatively small , the effect of the photospheric background on the chromospheric emission profiles is very modest . in figure 9 , the asymmetry induced by this effect is barely discernible .    to complement the simulation ,",
    "photospheric models were also computed for a range of effective temperatures . as with figure 9 , simulated h and k emission lines , both with @xmath66 and a k line twice as strong as the h line , were added to the set of synthetic photosphere spectra . from these superimposed spectra the values of @xmath19 , @xmath1 , and @xmath52 were calculated .",
    "in addition to simulations with symmetric emission profiles , calculations were also done for input values of @xmath67 and 0.6 , as well as a range of wavelength separations between the two maxima in each bimodal profile . in all cases",
    "the input h and k emission profiles had identical asymmetry , such that initially @xmath68 .",
    "the value of this difference after superimposing the model photosphere spectrum illustrates the extent to which photospheric corruption might be affecting the observed asymmetry differences .",
    "the resultant values of @xmath52 are plotted versus @xmath2 in figure 10 .",
    "modest systematic variations are seen as a function of @xmath45 , which are largely driven by photospheric corruption of the k line rather than the h line .",
    "however , the magnitude of these asymmetry differences is much smaller ( by a factor of 5 ) than the star - to - star differences , and their trend with @xmath45 , than we actually observe .",
    "although this modeling approach is no substitute for a self - consistent treatment of radiative transfer through a combined model photosphere plus chromosphere , it does suggest that the @xmath17 asymmetry variations among red giants are not an artifact of photospheric differences , but reflect physical differences in the stellar chromospheres .",
    "in computing the synthetic spectra it was assumed that there is no systematic velocity shift between the simulated emission profiles and the photospheric spectrum . as noted above , in the data reduction procedure all of the observed spectra",
    "were shifted so that the photospheric lines are at the rest wavelengths as defined by the arcturus atlas .",
    "the average central wavelengths of the h and k emission profiles were measured in this rest frame for the 8 stars observed at the 2.7-m telescope in 2008 .",
    "there was no systematic displacement of the emission line centers from the photospheric reference frame .",
    "the average deviation was found to be @xmath69 km s@xmath38 with a standard deviation of 1.0 km s@xmath38 ( 1 pixel = 2.4 km s@xmath38 ) , and there is no trend with @xmath45 color .",
    "values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath1 for the h chromospheric emission line have been measured for a large sample of red giant stars .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 , plotted as a function of @xmath2 in figure 1 , and in a series of other diagrams are compared to @xmath0 values of the k line based on the same spectroscopic data set ( see shetrone et al .",
    "many of the spectra exhibit opposite asymmetries between the h and k line emission peaks . the h line @xmath1 value is larger than the @xmath19 ratio for the majority of stars in our sample , however , this difference shows a trend with @xmath2 color , being largest among giants with @xmath70 .",
    "the observations can be interpreted within a framework in which the h and k emission lines are formed at different levels in a stellar chromosphere , thereby allowing for a comparison between the motions of these layers .",
    "asymmetry in either the h or k line , i.e. , @xmath0 different from unity , is generally attributed to doppler shifts resulting from a differential velocity field in the chromosphere . in this doppler picture , gas that produces the h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 peaks",
    "is taken to be moving with a different velocity to the gas that contributes to the central h@xmath7 reversal .",
    "this causes the h@xmath7 reversal to be redshifted or blueshifted with respect to the h@xmath9 peaks , resulting in an emission line asymmetry .",
    "such a scenario has been invoked , for example , to interpret h and k line asymmetry differences among dwarf stars ( rauscher & marcy 2006 ) .    on the sun",
    "the @xmath0 values for the h emission line follow a slightly skewed distribution with a maximum at unity , a minimum of @xmath71 , and an extended tail to values greater than @xmath72 ( cram & dam 1983 ) .",
    "there is only a weak correlation between @xmath61 and the strength of the h emission , from which cram & dam infer that `` the @xmath0 ratio of the integrated solar h line is not due specifically to bright ( e.g. , network ) elements '' .",
    "furthermore , the h@xmath7 reversal is found to be consistently displaced away from whichever of the h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 peaks is brightest , which indicates that doppler velocity shifts of the h@xmath7 reversal are an important factor governing the asymmetry of the h emission profile ( cram & dam 1983 ) . enhanced emission in the h@xmath5 peak appears to be associated with shock heating ( e.g. , beck et al .",
    "2008 ) . in regions of the quiet sun , the h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 emission have even been observed to disappear , indicative of cool elements within cells of the chromospheric network ( rezaei et al .",
    "2008 ) .    among the majority of dwarf stars with spectral types in the range k7-m5 ,",
    "rauscher & marcy ( 2006 ) show that @xmath73 in both the h and k lines , with a preference for @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , the k@xmath7 reversal tends to have a systematically greater redshift than the h@xmath7 feature .",
    "it is worth quoting the conclusions of rauscher & marcy on this point : `` while the unequal degeneracies in the upper levels producing these lines cause somewhat differing optical depths , these data emphasize that the h and k lines are produced in slightly different regions of the chromosphere and are therefore governed by slightly different line transfer and kinematics . ''",
    "the redshift of the central reversals is attributed by them to micro - flare activity that heats chromospheric gas and propels it outwards .",
    "as it moves upward it cools and decelerates , resulting in the gas that contributes to the central reversal being redshifted relative to the faster moving , hotter gas below it that produces the emission peaks .",
    "the velocity differential between these regions of gas is on the order of several tenths of a km s@xmath38 .",
    "the greater redshift of the k@xmath7 reversal compared to the h@xmath7 reversal is consistent with the former arising from slightly higher altitudes in the chromosphere , where deceleration has proceeded to a greater degree .",
    "clues to the systematics of the chromospheric motions at work within our sample of red giants can be found in figures 11 and 12 .",
    "average values of @xmath1 and @xmath19 were calculated for each star using the data in table 1 .",
    "the main panel of figure 11 shows these average asymmetries plotted versus one another . in figure 12",
    "both @xmath75 and @xmath76 are plotted versus the average value of the asymmetry difference @xmath77 .",
    "this diagram is analogous to figure 5 , except that all data for a given star are averaged , so that each giant is represented by a single point .",
    "these figures map out the relative behavior of the h and k emission line profiles .    among giants with the largest values of @xmath1 ( @xmath78 )",
    "this asymmetry parameter is nearly equal in value to @xmath19 ; such stars exhibit a blue - dominant asymmetry in both the h and k emission profiles , and scatter closely around the locus @xmath79 which is shown by the straight line in figure 11 . among such stars it seems that the h and k lines are evincing similar velocity fields and that there is no evidence of systematic outflow in the chromosphere .",
    "turning to giants with @xmath80 , there is a noticeably larger range of k line asymmetries and one starts to see a systematic shift of the k line profiles to red - dominant asymmetries , i.e. , to @xmath81 .",
    "a significant fraction of giants with @xmath80 also have @xmath81 , and so exhibit opposite h and k emission profile asymmetries . among such stars",
    "we infer that an accelerating outflow has become established within a region of the chromosphere that spans altitudes at which the k@xmath9 and k@xmath7 features are formed .",
    "we interpret the later feature as being formed at higher levels , in regions of faster outflow , than k@xmath9 .",
    "this causes the central absorption reversal to be blueshifted with respect to the emission profile , thereby giving a characteristic asymmetry of @xmath81 .",
    "however , the outflow does not yet extend to the deeper altitudes where the h@xmath7 feature is formed .",
    "it is therefore a change in the k line asymmetry that drives the non - zero values of @xmath77 among giants having @xmath80 . as a result ,",
    "many of these stars fall below the straight line in figure 11 .",
    "this phenomenon is reflected by a plateau of approximately constant @xmath82 in the upper panel of figure 12 , whereas the same stars fall along an inclined locus in the lower panel .",
    "eventually the accelerating outflow extends downwards in altitude to regions where the h@xmath7 feature is formed , resulting in @xmath1 now decreasing to a value below unity .",
    "this brings about a maximum in the mean difference @xmath77 of @xmath83 .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath19 are now less than unity and we infer that an accelerating wind now extends throughout the chromospheric regions where the k@xmath7 , k@xmath9 , h@xmath7 , and possibly the h@xmath9 features originate .",
    "as the value of @xmath1 drops below @xmath84 the difference in @xmath0 between the h and k lines diminishes , and for stars with @xmath85 - 0.5 the asymmetry parameters for the two lines become approximately equal .",
    "such giants may be those with the largest velocity gradients in the chromosphere .",
    "they have returned to the vicinity of the straight line plotted in figure 11 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the systematic trends outlined in the previous paragraphs correspond approximately to a sequence in @xmath2 color .",
    "thus it may be that as stars evolve up the red giant branch they travel along an evolutionary sequence in figures 11 and 12 , with winds first originating at high altitudes in the chromosphere , and then becoming more established and extending to lower altitudes .",
    "however , it is also known that @xmath0 for the h and k lines can be time variable ( shetrone et al .",
    "2008 ) , and this is likely to impose scatter on any long - term evolutionary sequence .",
    "an excellent example is the star arcturus , which both gray ( 1980 ) and qin & li ( 1987 ) find to be variable over timescales of hours to months .",
    "this indicates that red giant atmospheres are likely subject to both short and long term dynamical modification .",
    "changes on a timescale of hours were interpreted by qin & li ( 1987 ) as being due to a `` chromospheric eruption '' that may have ejected mass rapidly through the chromosphere and possibly to escape from the star .    in the solar chromosphere",
    "significant differences in the ratio of h and k line source functions can occur over a range in height of approximately 500 - 700 km ( linsky 1970 ) . comparing to a g giant of solar effective temperature and mass , and radius @xmath86 , the chromospheric scale height might be expected to vary roughly as the inverse surface gravity , i.e. , as @xmath87 .",
    "thus , variations in the ratio of the h and k line source functions might extend over an altitude range of @xmath88 km .",
    "a disturbance moving at 5 km s@xmath38 could traverse such a region in about 44 hours . although we do have multiple observations of many stars , the typical time difference between consecutive spectra is months or years rather than days .",
    "thus , in general , we do nt have fine enough temporal coverage to detect possible systematic variations in h or k line asymmetries due to passage of a short - term `` event '' through the chromosphere . in the case of hd 27697 ,",
    "the two spectra obtained in 1998 on consecutive nights reveal no evidence for any significant differences in @xmath17 for either the h@xmath9 or k@xmath9 features .",
    "similarly , spectra of hd 82635 taken 18 nights apart in 2007 show no significant evidence of variability . in 2006 , the data show that both the h@xmath9 and k@xmath9 @xmath17 values for hd 222404 differed significantly between 1",
    "september and 4 october , but our observations were a month , rather than several days , apart .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the h and k line observations of arcturus by qin & li ( 1987 ) may depict a very energetic version of a short - timescale phenomenon .",
    "the asymmetry indices measured by them ( using their notation where @xmath89 refers to the intensity in an emission line peak ) vary within the range @xmath90 and @xmath91 over a period of 4 hours , and all their observations show @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , in 4 of their 6 spectra @xmath93 while @xmath94 , i.e. , the h and k emission lines evince opposite asymmetries . on the basis of this example , it follows that short - term variability could indeed contribute to the star - to - star scatter in asymmetries seen in the mcdonald spectra . such effects may be superimposed on a much longer - term evolutionary sequence that produces the trends with @xmath45 color seen in figures 11 and 12 , and which may be associated with the onset of pulsation and/or the driving of a large scale wind .",
    "this project was completed as part of the mcdonald observatory reu program and was supported under nsf ast-0649128 .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",

    "<S> the h and k emission lines probe the differential motion of certain chromospheric layers in the stellar atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> data on @xmath0 for the k line are drawn from previous papers and compared to the analogous h line ratio , the h and k spectra being from the same sets of observations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the h line @xmath1 value is + 0.04 larger , on average , than the equivalent k line ratio , however , the difference varies with @xmath2 color . </S>",
    "<S> red giants cooler than @xmath3 are more likely to have @xmath4 , whereas the opposite is true for giants hotter than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the h and k line asymmetries could be caused by the layers of chromospheric material from which these emission features arise moving with different velocities in an expanding outflow . </S>"
