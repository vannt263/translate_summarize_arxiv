    "in recent developments of string theory , the idea of holography has obviously played crucial roles .",
    "holography claims that the degrees of freedom in @xmath3-dimensional quantum gravity are much more reduced than we naively think , and will be comparable to those of quantum many body systems in @xmath4 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this was essentially found by remembering that the entropy of a black hole is not proportional to its volume , but to its area of the event horizon @xmath5 ( the bekenstein - hawking formula @xcite ) : s_bh=  , [ bhf ] where @xmath6 is the newton constant .",
    "owing to the discovery of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , we know explicit examples where the holography is manifestly realized .",
    "the ads / cft argues that the quantum gravity on @xmath3-dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime ( ads@xmath7 ) is equivalent to a certain conformal field theory in @xmath4 dimensions ( cft@xmath8 ) @xcite .    even after quite active researches of ads / cft for these ten years , fundamental mechanism of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence still remains a mystery , in spite of so many of evidences in various examples .",
    "in particular , we can not answer which region of ads is responsible to particular information in the dual cft . to make modest progresses for this long standing problem",
    ", we believe that it is important to understand and formulate the holography in terms of a universal observable , rather than quantities which depend on the details of theories such as specific operators or wilson loops etc .",
    "we only expect that a quantum gravity in some spacetime is dual to ( i.e. equivalent to ) a certain theory which is governed by the law of quantum mechanics .",
    "we would like to propose that an appropriate quantity which can be useful in this universal viewpoint is the entanglement entropy .",
    "indeed , we can always define the entanglement entropy in any quantum mechanical system .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath9 in quantum field theories or quantum many body systems is a non - local quantity as opposed to correlation functions .",
    "it is defined as the von neumann entropy @xmath9 of the reduced density matrix when we ` trace out ' ( or smear out ) degrees of freedom inside a @xmath10-dimensional space - like submanifold @xmath11 in a given @xmath12-dimensional qft , which is a complement of @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath9 measures how the subsystems @xmath13 and @xmath11 are correlated with each other .",
    "intuitively we can also say that this is the entropy for an observer in @xmath13 who is not accessible to @xmath11 as the information is lost by the smearing out in region @xmath11 .",
    "this origin of entropy looks analogous to the black hole entropy . indeed , this was the historical motivation of considering the entanglement entropy in quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the leading divergence of @xmath9 is proportional to the area of the subsystem @xmath13 , called the area law @xcite ( refer also to the review articles @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath9 is defined as a von neumann entropy , we expect that the entanglement entropy is directly related to the degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , in two - dimensional conformal field theory , the entanglement entropy is proportional to the central charge in two - dimensional conformal field theories ( 2d cfts ) as shown in @xcite , where a general prescription of computing the entropy in 2d cfts is given .",
    "also in the mass perturbed cfts ( massive qfts ) the same conclusion holds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our holographic result shows that the similar statement is also true in four or higher even - dimensional cfts . as opposed to the thermal entropy ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is non - vanishing at zero temperature .",
    "therefore we can employ it to probe the quantum properties of the ground state for a given quantum system .",
    "it is also a useful order parameter of quantum phase transition at zero temperature as will be explained in sec .",
    "[ secpha ] .",
    "now we come back to our original question where in ads given information in cft is saved .",
    "since the information included in a subsystem @xmath11 is evaluated by the entanglement entropy @xmath9 , we can formulate this question more concretely as follows : `` which part of ads space is responsible for the calculation of @xmath9 in the dual gravity side ? ''",
    "two of the authors of this article proposed a holographic formula of the entanglement entropy in @xcite : s_a=  , [ rtf ] where @xmath14 is the @xmath10-dimensional minimal surface @xmath14 whose boundary is given by the @xmath15-dimensional manifold @xmath16 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : holo ] ) ; the constant @xmath17 is the newton constant of the general gravity in ads@xmath7 .",
    "this formula can be applied equally well to asymptotically ads static spacetimes .",
    "originally , this formula ( [ rtf ] ) is speculated from the bekenstein - hawking formula ( [ bhf ] ) .",
    "indeed , since the minimal surface tends to wrap the horizon in the presence of event horizon , our formula ( [ rtf ] ) can be regarded as a generalization of the well - known formula ( [ bhf ] ) . also the area law of @xmath9 @xcite can be automatically derived from our holographic description .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explain this holographic description and then to review its current status with recent progresses and applications @xcite-@xcite . in ads@xmath18cft@xmath19",
    ", we can confirm that the formula ( [ rtf ] ) is precisely true by comparing the holographic result with the known 2d cft results @xcite .",
    "in higher - dimensional cases , however , the proposed formula ( [ rtf ] ) has not been derived rigorously from the bulk to boundary relation in ads / cft @xcite at present .",
    "also the direct calculations of the entanglement entropy in the cft side is very complicated in higher dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , a heuristic derivation has been presented in @xcite and many evidences @xcite have been found .",
    "our holographic formula has also been successfully applied to the explanation of black hole and de - sitter entropy @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier pioneering ideas on the entanglement entropy in ads / cft with event horizon ; see also @xcite ) , and to an order parameter of a confinement / deconfinement phase transition @xcite .    in condensed matter physics",
    ", the entanglement entropy is expected to be a key quantity to understand several aspects of quantum many - body physics .",
    "a central question in quantum many - body physics is how we can characterize different phases and phase transitions . while microscopic hamiltonians in condensed matter systems ( electronic systems , in particular ) are quantum mechanical , a wide range of quantum phases turn out to have a classical analogue , and if so , they can be understood in terms of symmetry breaking of some kind , and in terms of classical order parameters . on the other hand",
    ", this paradigm , known from landau and ginzburg , does not always apply when phases of our interest are inherently quantum .",
    "indeed , one of main foci in modern condensed matter physics is to understand quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them , which are beyond the landau - ginzburg paradigm . to name a few , relatively well - understood examples , the fractional quantum hall effect , and quantum magnets on some geometrically frustrated lattices",
    "have attracted a lot of interest .",
    "many - body wavefunctions of quantum ground states in these phases look featureless when one looks at correlation functions of local operators ; they can not be characterized by classical order parameters of some kind .",
    "indeed , they should be distinguished by their pattern of entanglement rather than their pattern of symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "thus , the entanglement entropy is potentially useful to characterize these exotic phases .",
    "one can ask these questions from a slightly more practical , but ultimately fundamental , point of view ; how can we simulate quantum states of matter efficiently by classical computers ?",
    "the total dimension of the hilbert space increases exponentially as we increase the system size , and hence bruteforce approaches ( e.g. , exact diagonalization ) to quantum many - body systems are destined to fail .",
    "it turns out having a good understanding on how local regions of the whole quantum system are entangled to each other would help to find good algorithms for quantum many - body problems , such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite . to be more precise , the scaling of the entanglement entropy as a function of the size of a given subregion of the system of interest gives us a criterion for efficient approximability .",
    "in other word , the entanglement entropy tells us amount of information and degrees of freedom necessary to represent a quantum ground state efficiently .    reversing the logic , one can distinguish different phases of quantum matter according to their computational complexity and hence from the scaling of the entanglement entropy .",
    "after all , what makes simulation of quantum systems by classical computers difficult is nothing but entanglement .",
    "indeed , this idea has been pushed extensively in recent couple of years for several 1d quantum systems .",
    "it has been revealed that several quantum phases in 1d spin chains can be distinguished by different scaling of the entanglement entropy .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and references in @xcite .    for higher - dimensional condensed matter systems ,",
    "there have been many recent attempts in this direction . in particular , the entanglement entropy was applied for so - called topological phases in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "typically , these phases have a finite gap and are accompanied by many exotic features such as fractionalization of quantum numbers , non - abelian statistics of quasi - particles , topological degeneracy , etc .",
    "they can be also useful for fault tolerant quantum computations .",
    "on the other hand , unconventional quantum liquid phases with gapless excitations , such as gapless spin liquid phases , seem to be , at least at present , more difficult to characterize in higher dimensions .",
    "our results from the ads / cft correspondence can be useful to study these gapless ( spin liquid ) states ( some of these phases have been suspected to be described by a relativistic gauge field theory of some sort @xcite ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",

    "consider a quantum mechanical system with many degrees of freedom such as spin chains .",
    "more generally , we can consider arbitrary lattice models or quantum field theories ( qfts ) .",
    "we put such a system at zero temperature and then the total quantum system is described by the pure ground state @xmath20 .",
    "we assume no degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "then , the density matrix is that of the pure state _",
    "[ pure]the von neumann entropy of the total system is clearly zero @xmath21 .",
    "next we divide the total system into two subsystems @xmath13 and @xmath11 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spinchain ] ) . in the spin chain example",
    ", we just artificially cut off the chain at some point and divide the lattice points into two groups . notice",
    "that physically we do not do anything to the system and the cutting procedure is an imaginary process . accordingly",
    "the total hilbert space can be written as a direct product of two spaces @xmath22 corresponding to those of subsystems @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "the observer who is only accessible to the subsystem @xmath13 will feel as if the total system is described by the reduced density matrix @xmath23 _ a= _ b  _ tot  , where the trace is taken only over the hilbert space @xmath24 .",
    "now we define the entanglement entropy of the subsystem @xmath13 as the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath23 @xmath25 this quantity provides us with a convenient way to measure how closely entangled ( or how `` quantum '' ) a given wave function @xmath26 is .    in time - dependent backgrounds",
    "the density matrices @xmath27 and @xmath23 are time dependent as dictated by the von neumann equation .",
    "thus we need to specify the time @xmath28 when we measure the entropy . in this paper , we will always deal with static systems except in sec .",

    "width=377 ]      there are several useful properties which the entanglement entropy enjoys generally .",
    "we summarize some of them as follows ( the derivations and other properties of the entanglement entropy can be found in e.g. the textbook @xcite ) :    * if the density matrix @xmath27 is pure such as in the zero temperature system , then we find the following relation assuming @xmath11 is the complement of @xmath13 : s_a = s_b  .",
    "[ ext ] this manifestly shows that the entanglement entropy is not an extensive quantity .",
    "this equality ( [ ext ] ) is violated at finite temperature . * for any three subsystems @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath39 that do not intersect each other , the following inequalities hold : @xmath40 these inequalities are called the strong subadditivity @xcite , which is the most powerful inequality obtained so far with respect to the entanglement entropy . in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the authors presented an entropic proof of the c - theorem by applying the strong subadditivity to 2d quantum field theories .",
    "* by setting @xmath11 empty in ( [ stronga ] ) , we can find the subadditivity relation s_a+bs_a+s_b  .",

    "sometimes this kind of entropy is called geometric entropy as it depends on the geometry of the submanifold @xmath13 .",
    "since the entanglement entropy is always divergent in a continuum theory , we introduce an ultraviolet cut off @xmath47 ( or a lattice spacing ) . then the coefficient in front of the divergence turns out to be proportional to the area of the boundary @xmath46 of the subsystem @xmath13 as first pointed out in @xcite , s_a=+  ,",

    "this is because the entanglement entropy represents a thermal entropy plus quantum corrections and it is defined by assuming that the subsystem @xmath11 is completely smeared , which will be expected to lead to the maximal entropy allowed in the region . if we assume this , then we immediately reach the holographic entanglement entropy formula ( [ cov ] ) .    in this way",
    ", we can extract the entropy in the dual time - dependent background by looking at our holographic entanglement entropy .",
    "one may think that the opposite may be true : the extraction of metric from the information of the entanglement entropy in cft .",
    "for recent discussions in this direction refer to @xcite .",
    "the setup of the bousso bound applied to the ads@xmath131/cft@xmath19 in the poincare coordinate @xmath361 . in this simplified case , the future cauchy horizon coincides with the future light - sheet @xmath354 . in the above figure we only write the future light - sheet and",
    "not the past one ( i.e. @xmath362 ) just for simplicity.,height=340 ]      in black hole backgrounds , taking the limit where @xmath13 is the total space at the boundary , @xmath9 becomes equal to the thermal entropy . in generic time - dependent backgrounds ,",
    "the thermal entropy is also time - dependent and is clearly defined uniquely as the von - neumann entropy of the thermal density matrix . on the other hand , in the dual gravity side , it corresponds to the black hole entropy which is obtained from the area of black hole horizon .",
    "however , we have two candidates of horizon : event horizon and apparent horizon . these two horizons are different in time - dependent spacetimes .",
    "our formula ( [ cov ] ) of the holographic entanglement entropy selects the latter i.e. the apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "this is because the extremal surface condition requires the vanishing of null expansion and this precisely match the definition of apparent horizon .",
    "notice also that the definition of event horizon is global . also our formula offers us to uniquely determine the time slice which is requires to define the apparent horizon .",
    "indeed , the recent works @xcite show that the area of apparent horizons behaves in a sensible way as the thermal entropy , while that of even horizon not .",
    "finally , let us discuss an example where we can apply the above covariant formula .",
    "we consider the ads vaidya solution ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath363 this is the solution to the einstein equation with the negative cosmological constant in the presence of null matter whose em tensor looks like @xmath364 .",
    "the null energy condition requires @xmath365 and thus we find that @xmath366 is a monotonically increasing function of the ( light - cone ) time @xmath367 .",
    "this background is asymptotically @xmath368 and if we assume that @xmath366 is a constant , then it is equivalent to the static btz black hole @xcite with the mass @xmath369",
    ". thus our background ( [ va ] ) describes an idealized collapse of a radiating star in the presence of negative cosmological constant .",
    "the dual theory is expected to be a cft in a time - dependent background .",
    "the time - dependence comes from the time - dependent temperature .",
    "we can now apply the covariant entanglement entropy formula ( [ cov ] ) and in the end we find @xmath370\\ , \\ ] ] as the expansion of small @xmath366 .",
    "the null energy condition guarantees that this is a monotonically increasing function of time .",
    "this shows that the entanglement entropy in this background is a monotonically increasing function of time as is so in the second law of the thermal entropy .",
    "we believe this behavior of the entanglement entropy in black hole formation processes is rather general . however , we would like to stress that we are not claiming that the entanglement entropy is always increasing .",
    "for example if we start with the system with maximally entangled , the entanglement entropy will decrease after a small perturbation due to the de - coherence phenomenon .",
    "in this article , we reviewed the recent progresses of holographic understanding of the entanglement entropy , starting from the main holographic formula ( [ arealaw ] ) .",
    "we mainly employed the setup of ads / cft , though we can straightforwardly extend our results to more general spacetimes with their holographic duals .",
    "even though the formula ( [ arealaw ] ) has not been rigorously proven , there have been many evidences so far . including the ones which we did not discuss in this article",
    ", we can list important evidences as follows :    * the area law ( [ divarea ] ) known in qft can be easily reproduced holographically .",
    "the warp factor in the ads space leads to the uv divergence of the dual cft as explained in sec .",
    "[ general proposal ] .",
    "* we can holographically derive the strong subadditivity ( [ sub ] ) in a very simple way as we reviewed in sec .",
    "[ stsub ] .",
    "* we find perfect agreements between the ads and cft sides in the ads@xmath18cft@xmath19 setup as in sec .",
    "[ ads3/cft2 ] . * in higher dimensions , it is not easy to calculate the entanglement entropy in qfts analytically . still we can show the semi - qualitative agreements between the cft and ads calculations as reviewed in sec .",
    "[ ads d+2/cft d+1 ] . moreover , for the logarithmic terms of the entropy we can show the precise agreement as its coefficient under the condition that the extrinsic curvature of @xmath46 is vanishing @xcite . * in the example of @xmath194 yang - mills theory compactified on a scherk - schwarz circle dual to the ads soliton , we can holographically detect a confinement / deconfinement transition as reviewed in sec .",
    "[ secpha ] .",
    "this qualitatively agrees both with the free yang - mills result and with recent lattice simulations .",
    "moreover , in an almost supersymmetric limit , the holographic result of the entanglement entropy quantitatively agrees with the free yang - mills result @xcite . * in the presence of a horizon , the minimal surface @xmath14 tends to wrap the ( apparent ) horizon .",
    "then the wrapped part gives an extensive contribution to the holographic entanglement entropy .",
    "this shows that our holographic formula generalizes the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula , as explained in sec .",
    "[ general proposal ] and sec .",
    "[ secbh ] .",
    "* we can regard black hole entropy as the entanglement entropy by applying the idea of the holographic entanglement entropy to either brane - world black holes or ads@xmath280cft@xmath268 as reviewed in sec .",
    "[ bfrs ] . *",
    "the holographic formula is nontrivially consistent with the covariant entropy bound ( bousso bound ) as explained in sec .",
    "[ seccov ] .",
    "there are many future directions .",
    "one of the most important future problems is to derive the holographic entanglement entropy from the first principle of ads / cft ( i.e. bulk to boundary relation ) . on the other hand , to confirm the ads / cft correspondence from the viewpoint of the entanglement entropy , we need to develop methods of calculations of the entanglement entropy in quantum field theories .",
    "since the holographic entanglement entropy is expected to be a universal observable in holography , this quantity may be useful when we try to extend the holography to other spacetimes such as de - sitter spaces .",
    "the precise relevance of the entanglement entropy to the understanding of black hole entropy has also been an interesting future problem .",
    "the fact that our covariant formula is closely related to the bousso bound may be a clue to this problem .",
    "it is also intriguing to apply our holographic entanglement entropy to various condensed matter systems .",
    "a complete holographic calculation of topological entanglement entropy for various @xmath101 dimensional systems with non - trivial topological orders will certainly be waited to be done in near future .",
