    "the description of high - energy hard cross  sections in qcd perturbation theory has a long history . starting from the early bfkl prediction of rising cross sections  @xcite at leading log@xmath1 level ( ll ) and from the @xmath2-factorization framework  @xcite , up to the difficult calculation of the next  to  leading ( nll ) kernel  @xcite and to its improvements  @xcite",
    ", a lot of work has been devoted to fill the gap between theory and small-@xmath0 phenomenology .    on the experimental side , the dis structure functions at hera  @xcite",
    "show a rise which is well described by large scaling violations arising in low order dglap  @xcite evolution . on the other hand , data for two  scale processes like @xmath3 for which the dglap picture is inappropriate , seem incompatible with the strong rise predicted by ll bfkl evolution .",
    "there is thus a need to reconcile the two theoretical pictures , which actually differ by the order of resummation of large logarithms ( log  @xmath4 vs. log  @xmath1 ) in the perturbative series .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "one expects qcd perturbation theory at low @xmath0 to be governed by some effective coupling @xmath5 which risks to be strong for two independent reasons .",
    "firstly , because of the logarithmic enhancements due to the opening of the small@xmath0 gluon phase space . this motivates the calculation of next - to - leading corrections to the hard - pomeron intercept , which however turn out to be quite large and negative  @xcite , pointing to some instability of the log  @xmath1 hierarchy . secondly , because energy evolution  by diffusion or tunneling  @xcite  may give rise to low values of @xmath6 , the gluon momentum transfer , thus implying a drift towards a really non - perturbative asymptotic regime   @xcite , characterized by soft physics .",
    "we must control , therefore , higher order subleading terms , and analyze the perturbatively accessible rapidity range .    a tentative answer to the above question marks about",
    "the perturbative behaviour comes from the ( double ) resummation approaches .",
    "the idea is to take into account higher order subleading terms in both variables ( log  @xmath1 and log  @xmath4 ) , based on some distinctive features of such terms .",
    "for instance , the `` duality '' approach  @xcite starts from the approximate symmetry between scaling violations and energy dependence in order to hint at a resummed form of the gluon splitting function .",
    "the `` renormalization - group improved '' ( rgi ) approach  @xcite starts from bfkl evolution at nll level , and resums those higher order subleading terms which are required by the rg behaviour for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "other resummation models are available also  @xcite .",
    "the rgi approach is able to provide predictions  @xcite for both the gluon splitting function and the gluon density itself , and i will concentrate on that approach in the following .",
    "the bfkl equation is , to start with , an evolution equation in the rapidity @xmath9 , induced by a kernel @xmath10 in @xmath6 space , which can be expanded in @xmath11 and has been calculated up to second order .",
    "the ll level is dominated by ( effective ) ladder diagrams with gluon exchange and the corresponding kernel is scale  invariant and given by ( @xmath12 ) . @xmath13",
    "the highest eigenvalue of @xmath14 yields the exponent for the energy dependence and is @xmath15 , a value which is too large compared to hera data ( e. g. , 0.55 for @xmath11=0.2 , compared to an observed value of about 0.2 ) .",
    "similarly , the gluon anomalous dimension , given by @xmath16 in @xmath17 moment space at one  loop level , acquires higher order singularities with positive residues . roughly speaking , the ll approximation grossly overestimates both two  scale cross ",
    "sections rise and scaling violations .",
    "the nll kernel , extracted in  @xcite after many years of work of various groups , yields some qualitatively new features and question marks .",
    "firstly , the corrections to the high  energy exponent are negative ( which is good ) , but with a quite large coefficient , as follows @xmath18 this points towards an instability of the leading ",
    "log  @xmath1 hierarchy , which is confirmed by the risk of oscillatory behaviour of the gluon density  @xcite for sizeably different external scales .",
    "secondly , running coupling effects are taken into account , and the scale of the coupling suggested by the kernel is @xmath19 . therefore , in order to avoid divergent integrations , we need to regularize the landau pole , by introducing some cutoff ( or freezing parameter ) @xmath20 . however ,",
    "when the energy increases , there is a favoured evolution towards smaller values of @xmath21 , by diffusion or tunneling , and this implies that the asymptotic high  energy exponent becomes @xmath20-dependent , i.e. , non  perturbative ( asymptotic pomeron ) .",
    "therefore , nll calculations raise more questions than they are able to answer , and call for the inclusion of higher order terms .",
    "higher order subleading contributions are not known in detail .",
    "we can argue , however , that a class of them are large , and required in order to build single ",
    "logarithmic scaling violations when either @xmath22 or @xmath23 is the leading scale  @xcite , and @xmath24 or @xmath25 is the corresponding bjorken variable .",
    "taking into account such terms is equivalent to resumming subleading terms in log  @xmath1 which are known because they are leading in log  @xmath4 and are provided therefore by the renormalization group .",
    "this idea was used in order to build the rgi approach of  @xcite , where the solution of the homogeneous small-@xmath0 equation was studied in detail by the use of the @xmath26expansion method  @xcite so as to calculate stable high  energy exponents and gluon anomalous dimension . in recent papers  @xcite",
    "the approach has been extended to the full inhomogeneous equation in a slightly different resummation scheme , which is more suitable for numerical evaluation .",
    "i am thus able to describe results for both the two  scale gluon density and for the splitting function in the collinear limit .",
    "results for the splitting function have been recently obtained in the duality approach also  @xcite .",
    "the basic problem considered in  @xcite is the calculation of the ( azimuthally averaged ) gluon green function @xmath27 as a function of the magnitudes of the external gluon transverse momenta @xmath28 .",
    "this is not yet a hard cross section , because we need to incorporate the impact factors of the probes  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the green function exhibits most of the physical features of the hard process , if we think of @xmath29 as external ( hard ) scales .",
    "the limits @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) correspond conventionally to the ordered ( anti - ordered ) collinear limit . by definition , in the @xmath26-space conjugate to @xmath32",
    "( so that @xmath33 ) we set @xmath34^{-1 } ( { { \\bf k}},{{\\bf k}}_0 ) \\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a kernel to be defined , whose @xmath37 limit is related to the bfkl @xmath32-evolution kernel discussed before .    the precise form of the kernel @xmath38 is given in ref .",
    "@xcite however , the basic features of the rgi approach is illustrated by a simple observation : in bfkl iteration , all possible orderings of transverse momenta are to be included , the ordered ( anti - ordered ) sequence @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) showing scaling violations with bjorken variable @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "therefore , if only leading @xmath43 contributions were to be considered , the kernel @xmath38 acting on @xmath44 would be approximately represented by the following eigenvalue function ( in the frozen coupling limit ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the one - loop gluon - gluon anomalous dimension and we have introduced the variable @xmath47 conjugate to @xmath43 .",
    "note , in fact , that eq .",
    "( [ ckoform ] ) reduces to the normal dglap evolution  @xcite in @xmath43 ( @xmath48 ) in the two orderings mentioned before , because @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is represented by @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) at fixed values of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) in the ordered ( anti - ordered ) momentum region .",
    "note also the @xmath26-dependent shift  @xcite of the @xmath47-singularities occurring in eq .",
    "( [ ckoform ] ) , which is required by the change of scale ( @xmath55 versus @xmath56 ) needed to interchange the orderings , i.e. , @xmath57 versus @xmath0 .",
    "we thus understand that the @xmath26-dependence of @xmath38 is essential for the resummation of the collinear terms and can be used to incorporate the exact ll collinear behaviour , while on the other hand , the @xmath58 behaviour of @xmath38 is fixed by the bfkl limit up to @xmath59 terms , so as to incorporate exact ll and nll kernels .",
    "such requirements fix the kernel up to contributions that are nnl in @xmath60 and nl in @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting integral equation to be solved by the definition  ( [ eqggf ] ) is thus a running coupling equation with non linear dependence on @xmath11 at appropriate scales , and it has a somewhat involved @xmath26-dependence in the improved kernels @xmath38 . its solution has been found in  @xcite by numerical matrix evolution methods in @xmath2- and @xmath0- space  @xcite , where the typical @xmath26-shifted form in the example  ( [ ckoform ] ) corresponds to the so - called consistency constraint  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , introducing the integrated gluon density @xmath62 the resummed splitting function @xmath63 is defined by the evolution equation @xmath64 and has been extracted  @xcite by a numerical deconvolution method  @xcite .",
    "we note immediately that @xmath65 turns out to be independent of @xmath66 for @xmath67 , yielding an important check of rg factorisation in our approach .",
    "results for @xmath68 are taken , namely @xmath69 with @xmath70 , in order to avoid sensitivity to the discretisation of the @xmath71-function initial condition in [ eqggf ] ( cf .",

    "in contrast , @xmath72evolution remains under perturbative control up to much larger rapidities and the np pomeron behaviour takes over only for @xmath100 , where the three cutoff solutions start to diverge  but seem anyhow quite modest compared to the order(s ) of magnitude difference with ll .",
    "the @xmath81 dependence of the ll solution is somewhat smaller than for @xmath72 this may seem surprising , but at larger @xmath32 the ll solution is in the np domain , where non - linearities ( in @xmath11 ) reduce the @xmath81 dependence . ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 is considerably larger for the resummed evolution , as consequence of the fact that subleading corrections lower both the pt and  even more  np exponents ( see eq.[yc ] ) .",
    "we note that at their respective @xmath89 s the @xmath72green s function is an order of magnitude larger than the ll one : the subleading corrections increase the overall amount of bfkl growth remaining within perturbative control .",
    "however , large densities @xmath101 are reached at cosiderably larger values of @xmath32 , so that saturation effects  @xcite are pushed towards higher energies . for the reference values @xmath102 gev , @xmath103",
    "this translates to y of order 15 , close to the kinematical limit of lhc , as a very rough estimate .    in fig .",

    "darker regions are less ir sensitive , and contours for particular values of the spread have been added to guide the eye . here",

    "so let us now therefore return to fig .",
    "[ f : manyreg ] and examine the characteristics of the @xmath72green s function in the perturbatively accessible domain , which should be describable by an equation of the form ( [ gpert ] ) .",

    "<S> after a brief introduction to low-@xmath0 qcd and to resummation approaches , i illustrate the predictions for the gluon green function and splitting function of a recent renormalization  group improved small-@xmath0 resummation scheme . </S>",
    "<S> i argue , on this basis , that the range of validity of perturbative calculations is considerably extended in rapidity with respect to leading log expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative high - energy exponents are predicted in a phenomenologically interesting range , and significant preasymptotic effects are found . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the splitting function shows a shallow dip in the moderate-@xmath0 region , followed by the expected small-@xmath0 power increase . </S>"
