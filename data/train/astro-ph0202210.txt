    "the lack of bright emission lines in the x - ray spectra of some shell - type supernova remnants has , for the last few years , been attributed to the presence of x - ray synchrotron radiation .",
    "the best known example , and the first shell - type remnant for which x - ray synchrotron radiation was claimed , is the remnant of @xcite .    indeed , the small equivalent widths of x - ray emission lines from the remnant ( also named or ) based upon asca observations @xcite , was reinterpreted by @xcite as due to the presence of a synchrotron component .",
    "additional support for this idea was provided by an apparent spatial correlation between the hard , continuum dominated x - ray emission and the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "however , the presence of fe k line emission at 6.4  kev complicates the interpretation of the hard x - ray continuum.this emission is the result of inner - shell ionizations of neutral or mildly ionized iron , followed by k shell fluorescence . under - ionization",
    "can also account for the lack of emission lines from the helium and hydrogen like ionization stages of ne , mg , si , s , which dominate the line spectra of young remnants like tycho and cas a. these elements have a lower fluorescence yield than fe",
    ".    under - ionization can occur if the plasma is far out of ionization equilibrium , or it may be the result of a low electron temperature , possibly caused by insufficient electron - ion temperature equilibration @xcite . in the latter case the presence of additional energetic electrons",
    "is required for the fe k emission , which should also give rise to non - thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "such non - maxwellian particle distributions are thought to be the result of collisionless shock heating @xcite here we present additional evidence for non - thermal bremsstrahlung based on xmm - newton observations of msh14 - 6_3_. we refer to @xcite for a different , chandra , vision on the hard x - ray emission from this remnant .",
    "xmm - newton   @xcite observed the southeast and northwest of msh14 - 6_3 _   on august 17 and 18 , 2000 , and the southwest on august 18 , 2001 .",
    "the effective exposure times are approximately 12  ks for the southwest , 17  ks for the southeast , and 12  ks for the two pointing towards the northwest of the remnant .",
    "we discuss here primarily the x - ray emission from the southeast and northwest of the remant .",
    "the analysis of the southwestern part of the remnant is still in a preliminary phase .",
    "most of the results presented here are based on data from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) , consisting of three ccd cameras mos1 and mos2 , and the pn .",
    "the latter has the largest effective area , as it is behind the mirror that is not partially blocked by the reflective grating spectrometer ( rgs ) , and the detector has a higher quantum efficiency @xcite .",
    "observations were made with the medium - thick filter in place , which serves to block ultra - violet contamination .",
    "satellite data were converted to cleaned event lists using sas , the standard xmm - newton  software package .",
    "images and spectra were extracted from the event lists , using only the standard event patterns 0 for pn , and 0 - 12 for mos .",
    "this allowed the use of standard spectral response matrices .    for the background correction of the spectra we used the publicly available , standard , background event files .",
    "unfortunately , these consist of observations taken with the thin filter , possibly resulting in a background overestimation at low photon energies .",
    "we therefore used additional off - center fields of the publicly available observation of g21.5 - 0.9 , a small supernova remnant , which was observed with the medium filter . in practice",
    "we only used these data to estimate the background for the soft x - ray emission from the southeast of msh14 - 6_3_.",
    "fig .  [ jvink - b2_fig - mosaic ] shows a mosaic of the epic observations .",
    "it illustrates the dramatic change in morphology going from energies of 0.5 - 1  kev to those @xmath1 kev , in more detail than previously observed by asca and bepposax @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ jvink - b2_fig - spectra]a , the spectra of the soft x - ray regions are dominated by emission lines of ovii , oviii , fexvii and ne ix , with some spatial variation in relative strength of the line emission .",
    "this is illustrated with better resolution by the rgs spectrum of the narrow , bright shell in the northwest of msh14 - 6_3_(fig .",
    "[ jvink - b2_fig - spectra]c ) .",
    "the presence of ovii is especially indicative of a low ionization , which is the result of a low electron temperature , and/or a small ionization time , where @xmath2 is the electron density , and @xmath3 is the time since the plasma has been shocked . ] .",
    "a lower limit to the electron temperature is obtained by assuming collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "this gives temperatures for the spectra in fig .",
    "[ jvink - b2_fig - spectra ] between 0.10  kev and 0.17  kev , see table  [ jvink - b2_tbl - soft ] .",
    "more realistic non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) models result in higher temperature estimates and somewhat better spectral fits ( table  [ jvink - b2_tbl - soft ] ) . although there are still discrepancies between the nei models and the data , possibly as a result of sharp density and temperature gradients and projection effects , they indicate that at least some regions have electron temperatures as low as 0.2  kev . these temperatures are lower than indicated by the asca and the bepposax data , but in accordance with the rosat pspc data of the northwestern rim @xcite .",
    "the electron temperatures are also consistent with shock velocities of 310 - 605  km / s , inferred from the width of the h@xmath4  and h@xmath5 lines , which , under the assumption of full electron - ion equilibration @xcite , translates into shock velocities of 310 - 605  km / s , and post shock gas temperatures of 0.11 - 0.42  kev .",
    "spectra from regions dominated by hard x - ray emission are characterized by a dominant continuum and very faint line emission .",
    "the spectrum from `` hard region 1 '' , which is one of the brightest hard x - ray emitting regions , shows more prominent line emission than from `` hard region 2 '' .",
    "it is not clear whether the more prominent line emission is something intrinsic to this bright x - ray knot , or that this is caused by a superposition of a soft x - ray emitting region , as this part of msh14 - 6_3 _  has a complicated morphology .",
    "good heuristic fits to the hard x - ray spectra consist of a power law continuum and a thermal components , but currently the spectral quality of this very diffuse component is not good enough to determine for instance whether the emission lines come from a plasma out of ionization - equilibrium . clearly , the appearance of the hard spectra in itself can be explained by x - ray synchrotron emission , with the line emission belonging to the thermal plasma , which is superimposed on the hard synchrotron continuum , but the xmm - newton  data show that there are two problems with this interpretation .",
    "the first problem is that the hard x - ray emitting region in the southeast as a whole shows evidence for fe k shell emission at 6.4  kev ( fig .",
    "[ jvink - b2_fig - spectra ] ) .",
    "this confirms the asca detection of fe k emission , but for a different region , and with a lower equivalent width of 0.24  kev .",
    "model calculations show that for a solar iron abundance the measured equivalent width is consistent with electron temperatures in excess of @xmath63  kev , and/or a power law electron distribution with an electron index @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , only if the iron abundance is more than the solar value , can the continuum be dominated by x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "the second problem is the lack of detailed spatial correlation between hard x - ray and radio emission , see for example ( fig .",
    "[ jvink - b2_fig - mosaic ] right ) the faint but distinct hard x - ray emission , labeled `` hard region 2 '' , which lies inside the radio shell .",
    "this is in contradiction with the spatial correlation reported by @xcite , based on lower spatial resolution data .",
    "in fact , the region with the hardest x - ray emission ( hard region 2 ) has such weak radio emission , that it is difficult to determine the radio flux density from the atca and most images @xcite , as these synthesis radio telescopes have sidelobes from brighter parts of the remnant which result in a negative flux density at this location .",
    "however , we have derived an upper limit of @xmath8 jy at 1 ghz based on these images and on a 5-ghz radio image made with the single - dish parkes telescope @xcite , using the generally accepted radio spectral index of -0.6 and total flux density of 49  jy at 1  ghz @xcite .",
    "fitting the x - ray spectrum of this region with a power law spectrum and a thermal ( cie ) spectrum yields a flux density at 1 kev ( @xmath9  hz ) of 1.6 x 10@xmath10  jy .",
    "connection of the radio and x - ray flux density gives a spectral index of @xmath11 , which is remarkbly close to the radio spectral index of -0.6 , giving the fact that the two frequencies encompass eight orders of magnitude .",
    "this does not rule out x - ray synchrotron emission , but it is peculiar that for this particular region synchrotron losses are almost absent , whereas the radio regions are dominated by thermal soft x - ray emission ; see for example the northern shell , and the ridge of radio emission connecting the southeastern and the northeastern shell , the region labeled `` soft region 2 '' in fig .",
    "[ jvink - b2_fig - mosaic ] .",
    "note that the hard x - ray regions lie inside the main shell , which is a different spatial arrangement than for sn  1006 , where the x - ray synchrotron emission seems confined to a region close to the shock front , and is highly limb brightened @xcite .",
    "we have presented spatially resolved xmm - newton  spectroscopy of the supernova remnant msh14 - 6_3 _ , which shows that the hard x - ray emission is not correlated with the radio emission . fe k emission at 6.4  kev is also present .",
    "both observations contradict the idea that the hard x - ray emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "the fe k emission indicates the presence of electrons with energies in excess of the ionization threshold ( @xmath12  kev ) , but these electrons should also give rise to bremsstrahlung .",
    "non - thermal _ electron distribution seems likely , as a _",
    "thermal _ distribution requires electron temperatures @xmath13@xmath143  kev , which is at odds with both the measured shock velocities @xcite and the electron temperatures of the regions dominated by soft x - ray emission .",
    "not discussed so far is the lack of line emission from o vii , which requires that the energetic electrons are part of an otherwise very cool electron distribution ( @xmath13@xmath15 30 ev ) .",
    "although we presented evidence for very low temperatures this clearly deserves future attention .",
    "moreover , as most electrons have low energies it means that the electron density is probably much higher than indicated by the x - ray data .",
    "low temperatures may be the result of insufficient electron - ion temperature equilibration .",
    "evidence for weak electron - ion equilibration was obtained from uv spectroscopy of sn 1006 , indicating @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ion temperature @xcite .",
    "recent calculations of ionization fractions for non - thermal electron distributions show that the ion fractions are quite similar to those of the equivalent temperature of the maxwellian part of the distribution , provided that the plasma is not in ionization equilibrium , as is usually the case in supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "clearly , more model calculations are needed to assess the effects of non - thermal electron distributions on the line emission .",
    "the evidence for non - thermal bremsstrahlung , raises the question whether other remnants may not have a similar x - ray component .",
    "this may be true , but in general it is hard to judge from hard x - ray tails alone whether the emission is non - thermal bremsstrahlung or x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "the situation in msh14 - 6_3 _  is more fortunate , as the overall electron temperature is relatively cool , which causes the energetic electrons to betray themselves by causing fe k fluorescence emission .",
    "moreover , it is possible that we observe msh14 - 6_3 _  during a special period in its evolution , as non - thermal electron distributions can only exist for a time scale comparable to the electron self - equilibration time scale ( @xmath18  s , see @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the extreme properties of the x - ray emission from this remnant may be related to a recent interaction of the blast wave with the steep density gradients associated with the wall of a wind blown cavity , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "clearly , the nature of the x - ray emission and its relation to the environment of msh14 - 6_3 _  is far from solved , as a comparison of this study with @xcite shows .",
    "however , more detailed imaging of the fe k emission and possible similar inner shell ionization lines from si k , may provide clear enough signatures for either non - thermal bremsstrahlung or x - ray synchrotron emission .",
