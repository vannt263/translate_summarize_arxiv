    "the possibility of destructive interference between two or more wave functions is among the most remarkable phenomena predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "the effect can be observed when electronic beams are split and then brought together after traveling paths of different lengths , or in a aharonov - bohm ( ab ) geometry  such as a ring  where two equal - length paths nevertheless can carry different phase factors in the presence of a magnetic flux .",
    "recent advances in nanotechnology have made possible the fabrication of quantum dots @xcite  analogous to artificial atoms or molecules  where these effects can be tested .",
    "in fact , the ab effect was recently observed using a quantum dot embedded in a ring in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite .",
    "another example of conductance cancellations are the well - known fano resonances@xcite that occur when charge can circulate through two paths : one with a discrete level and the other with a continuum of states .",
    "many physical realizations of fano resonances are known .",
    "for example , when an atom is deposited on a metallic surface , a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip probes transmission to the tip either through the atom or directly from the surface , leading to current cancellations @xcite .",
    "in addition , theoretical studies predict that fano resonances should appear in `` t - shaped '' geometries where an active dot  connected to left and right electrodes  is also side - connected to another dot @xcite .",
    "a similar conductance cancellation has been predicted using double quantum - dot molecules attached to leads @xcite and in a 2@xmath12 quantum - dot array @xcite .",
    "all these cancellations are caused by destructive interference among two different paths between conductors .",
    "related cases correspond to multiple - level dots with noninteracting electrons @xcite , which can also be rephrased as a many - dot problem connected to leads in ring - like geometries , leading naturally to conductance cancellations .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to report an unexpected conductance cancellation found in linear arrays of @xmath2 quantum dots ( @xmath2 odd and keeping only one level per dot ) .",
    "these arrays do not have any obvious real - space paths that may lead to explicit ab or fano interferences to rationalize the conductance zeros found here  all electrons travel through the same chain  and in this respect the interference is exotic . in addition , the reported cancellations occur only in the presence of coulomb interactions , and in the previously believed to be well - understood kondo regime @xcite . in fact , _ the kondo peaks are here found to be split in half _ , a curious effect that may be observable experimentally at very low temperatures .",
    "although transport through many quantum dots@xcite or stm - engineered atomic systems@xcite has received considerable attention in recent years , experiments using 3 dots or atoms have not been sufficiently accurate to address the effect found in this paper .",
    "note that conductance dips have also been observed experimentally and theoretically at high magnetic fields in a two - level single dot @xcite .",
    "this effect was ascribed to transitions between total spin s=1 and s=0 dot states , a situation that does not seem to apply to our case with an odd number of electrons in the ground state @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] , the hamiltonian and many - body technique are described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the main results are presented , with emphasis on the conductance cancellation for an odd number of dots . the case of an even number of dots is also described , and in this situation there is no cancellation .",
    "the dependence of the results with parameters in the model is presented in this section as well . in sec.[sec:1dot ] , results for 1 , 4 , and 5 dots are briefly described . in sec.[sec : explanations ] , possible explanations of the conductance dip effect are presented .",
    "they include interference between conduction processes with one more and one less particle in the cluster , as well as mappings into systems with the t - shape geometry that are known to lead to interference . in sec.[sec : conclusions ] , conclusions are presented .    throughout the paper",
    "it is emphasized that confirmation of our results using other techniques is important . although the numerical studies presented below do not seem to be severely affected by size effects , size dependences are sometimes very subtle .",
    "thus , further work is needed to confirm the exotic conductance dip found here numerically . if this confirmation occurs , the effect unveiled in the present investigations ",
    "an unexpected quantum interference process in linear chains of dots  should be searched for experimentally .",
    "the effort should be carried out at sufficiently low temperatures such that the dip structure becomes visible .",
    "keeping one level per dot , the hamiltonian for our @xmath2-dot system coupled to leads is @xmath3=@xmath4+@xmath5+@xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the electronic hopping and hubbard interaction in the dots subsystem ( @xmath8 labels the dots ) using a standard notation .",
    "a gate voltage @xmath9 of equal strength for the @xmath2 dots is also included .",
    "the term @xmath5 represents the non - interacting electrons in the leads , with a nearest - neighbors hopping amplitude @xmath10 , while @xmath6 is the hopping from the ideal leads to the dots and its amplitude is @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the geometry used in the study and conventions followed .",
    "the hamiltonian discussed here becomes particle - hole symmetric for the case @xmath12=@xmath13 , precisely the gate voltage needed for the conductance cancellation reported below .",
    "however , in subsection [ subsec : symmetries ] other less symmetric models were studied as well , and the zero in the conductance survives .",
    "thus , the dip reported in this paper does not seem to originate from a highly symmetric hamiltonian but its origin is more robust .",
    "the zero - temperature , @xmath14=0 , green function @xmath15 to transfer charge from sites l to r ( fig.[fig1 ] ) can be obtained by an exact - diagonalization ( lanczos ) solution@xcite of a cluster with @xmath16 sites containing the @xmath2 dots .",
    "the exact information about the cluster under study is supplemented by an embedding procedure between the leads , already discussed in previous literature @xcite . to reproduce the one - dot kondo effect it is crucial that the exactly - solved cluster contains also a small portion of the lead@xcite , assumed also in a linear arrangement for simplicity .",
    "the cluster size @xmath16 is chosen such that @xmath16=@xmath2 + 2@xmath17 , where @xmath17=1,3,5 , ...",
    "as discussed before @xcite , with this convention the portion of the leads in the cluster contains a zero - energy state that induces the kondo effect already at the cluster level , reducing finite - size effects .",
    "the rest of the contacts is incorporated using the dyson equation @xmath18=@xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the exactly - known green function matrix of the cluster , @xmath18 is the dressed green - function matrix across the cluster from l to r , and @xmath21 is the matrix of hopping elements connecting the cluster and leads . in the present study ,",
    "the total @xmath22-component of the spin is either 1/2 or -1/2 for an odd number of sites in the exactly - solved cluster . to respect particle - hole symmetry at every step in the calculation ,",
    "the cluster ground - state is here taken as the sum ( divided by @xmath23 ) of the ground states of the subspaces with total spin @xmath22-component 1/2 and -1/2 .",
    "this leads to green functions for the `` up '' and `` down '' spins that are identical .",
    "other conventions , discussed in the appendix , lead to qualitatively similar results regarding the presence of internal structure in the conductance kondo peak . to consider charge fluctuations , the cluster green functions @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath25 + 1 electrons are combined .",
    "the mixed green function @xmath20 is written as @xmath20=@xmath26 . with the dressed green function @xmath18 from the dyson eq .",
    ", the total cluster charge is obtained as @xmath27=@xmath28 ( the sum in @xmath29 runs over the cluster sites and @xmath30 is the fermi energy , assumed 0 in the numerical calculations discussed below ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the charge at the cluster in the mixed ( @xmath25/@xmath25 + 1 ) state is @xmath31=@xmath32-@xmath33+@xmath34+@xmath35 and , then , @xmath36 can be found self - consistently to satisfy @xmath27=@xmath31 ( in the region emphasized in the next section , with a @xmath0 cancellation , @xmath31@xmath37@xmath16 ) . finally , using the keldish formalism the conductance @xmath0 is written as @xcite @xmath38=@xmath39 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the leads density - of - states ( dos ) is @xmath40 , assumed here to be a semi - circle from -2@xmath10 to 2@xmath10 ( the results are weakly dependent on this assumption ) .",
    "previous studies showed that this formalism  combination of exact - diagonalization and embedding  is sufficiently powerful to reproduce the kondo effect in electronic transport across one dot @xcite , and for this reason there is no _ a priori _ reason why it would fail for more dots .",
    "nevertheless , to be cautious in our discussion below statements are included to alert the reader on possible subtle size effects that could alter our conclusions . as already mentioned , in the appendix alternative conventions to our choice of spin quantum numbers for the exactly - solved cluster ground state are also discussed .",
    "these alternative conventions also lead to dips in the conductance kondo peak , as in the results presented in the following sections .",
    "although more work is needed to confirm the existence of the conductance dip reported below , the numerical results appear to be sufficiently robust that the effect could even be observed experimentally at very low temperatures .",
    "the technique described in the previous paragraph was applied here to the case of @xmath2@xmath411 quantum dots forming a linear array .",
    "our original motivation was the study of transport in the regime of large @xmath42 where @xmath2 odd ( even ) would lead to a quantum - dot subsystem with spin 1/2 ( 0 ) and , as a consequence , the presence ( absence ) of the kondo effect as indeed occurs .",
    "however , studies at intermediate couplings and hoppings regimes led to surprises .",
    "the most unexpected result of the present effort is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a where the conductance across 3 dots is shown for @xmath12 near @xmath13 ( inducing one electron per dot ) , at relatively small @xmath42 .",

    ", the peak is found to be split in half by an unexpected zero in the conductance at exactly @xmath12=@xmath13 .",
    "this cancellation is absent at @xmath43=0 , where @xmath0/@xmath44=1 at @xmath12=0 since the exactly - solved cluster has a zero - energy state aligned with the leads fermi - energy ( assumed at 0 ) . as @xmath43 increases",
    ", coulomb blockade and kondo peaks are generated , but the latter is always split by a zero at @xmath12=@xmath13 . as a consequence , the effect appears to originate in correlation effects induced by a nonzero @xmath43 .",
    "our study for increasing @xmath2 suggests that the effect is present for any odd @xmath2 , while for @xmath2 even ( 2 as example , fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) there is no conductance cancellation ( the two peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b are related to the kondo splitting  without a zero  of double quantum dots , previously discussed @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath42-dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c - f suggests that there is an intermediate hopping range where the zero conductance effect could be observed@xcite , while both at very small and large @xmath42 , its experimental observation will be difficult .",
    "the conductance cancellation fig .",
    "[ fig2]a is unexpected since there are no obvious real - space multiple paths that can lead to interference .",
    "electrons here travel through a one dimensional geometry .",
    "note also that one level per dot is kept in our analysis , and cancellations as in ref .",
    "are not obviously present .    to gain insight on the origin of the reported phenomenon , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the real ( re ) and imaginary ( i m ) components of the _ cluster _ green function from one extreme of the cluster to the other ( denoted @xmath45 ) , for 2 and 3 dots .",
    "the overall conductance emerges from the behavior of @xmath45 at @xmath46=0 , in the embedding procedure .",
    "clearly , the results for 2 and 3 dots have different symmetry properties under @xmath46@xmath47@xmath48 : while for 2 dots re(@xmath45 ) is even , for 3 dots it is odd generating a zero at @xmath46=0 .",
    "since both imaginary parts cancel at @xmath46=0 , then re(@xmath45 ) and im(@xmath45 ) are zero ( re nonzero ) for odd ( even ) number of dots ( this rule was verified numerically beyond the 2- and 3-dots example shown ) .",
    "if @xmath45=0 , the dyson - equation embedding procedure can not generate a nonzero conductance . if @xmath43@xmath470 , the two peaks closest to @xmath46=0 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( right upper panel ) merge and the cancellation does not occur .      an important aspect of the methodology discussed here , and in previous literature , involves the exact solution of a cluster followed by an embedding procedure . from the cluster size dependence it is possible to infer whether a particular feature under study will survive the bulk limit or not .",
    "unfortunately , the cpu time rapidly grows with the cluster size since the cluster green functions at all distances are needed for the dyson equations , and each green function is calculated with approximately one hundred steps in the continued - fraction procedure @xcite .",
    "this limits our detailed study of the conductance dip to clusters with 5 and 9 sites ( while a few values of the gate voltage can still be investigated using 13 sites ) . in fig.[fig7 ] , results for @xmath16=5 and 9 are presented at a small value of @xmath42 .",
    "this small hopping was used to amplify the region where the dip dominates ( as @xmath42/@xmath10 increases , the dip width is reduced as shown in fig.[fig2]c - f ) .",
    "the results in the figure show that the dip _ survives _ the increase of the cluster size , and the maximum in the conductance actually is located even further away from @xmath12/@xmath43=-0.5 as the @xmath16 grows . while this is not a definite proof , it is strongly suggestive that the conductance dip is not an artifact of the many - body procedure and cluster - size used , but it may be a real effect present in the bulk . nevertheless , it is desirable to have independent tests of our results using other many - body methods to fully confirm our conclusions .      in real quantums dots , the electron - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian used in previous sections can not be achieved since the fermi level lies just a small fraction of ev above the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "however , it is always possible to find a gate potential where the main levels involved  @xmath12 and @xmath12+@xmath43  are symmetrically located around @xmath49 . since all the energy scales important for the kondo effect ( @xmath43 and @xmath11 ) are of the order of mev @xcite these levels are very close of @xmath49 , achieving an approximate electron - hole symmetry .",
    "in addition to the previous argument , it is possible to repeat the calculations presented before for cases where the particle - hole symmetry is not present .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , by merely adding small random components to the on - site hubbard energies and , in addition , introducing small site energies . to further break symmetries of the problem , the hopping @xmath11 from the 3-dot region to the rest",
    "can also be made different on the right and the left , and even the two internal dot - dot hopping amplitudes @xmath42 can be made different as well .",
    "one representative result of this study is shown in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the dip in the conductance survives the breaking of symmetries in the model . as a consequence",
    ", the effect appears to be robust and independent of fine details in the analysis .",
    "the case of one dot is special .",
    "if a @xmath50 cluster with an odd number of sites ( e.g. , + -o-+ ) is solved exactly , the degeneracy between @xmath50 - 1 , @xmath50 , and @xmath50 + 1 _ remains _ even for nonzero @xmath43 .",
    "this is an accidental degeneracy that avoids the dip splitting of the kondo peak found with 3 or more ( odd ) dots .",
    "however , by simply adding on - site energies @xmath51 and @xmath52 at the first and last sites of the cluster , the accidental degeneracy at @xmath43@xmath530 is removed and now a conductance cancellation occurs as in the other cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) @xcite .",
    "the dip phenomenon appears to be general and robust .",

    "[ fig4]b illustrates results obtained for 5 dots ( 7-site cluster ) . here , once again , @xmath0=0 at @xmath12=@xmath13 .",
    "in addition , a rich structure if observed at higher frequencies with multiple conductance cancellations that resemble fano resonances .",
    "their origin is similar to those discussed for 3 dots and emerge from cancellations between `` competing '' poles at close distance in the green function .",
    "even 4 dots ( fig .  [ fig4]c ) shows a highly nontrivial structure , also with cancellations away from @xmath12=@xmath13 .",

    ", there is no cancellation since the real part is even . since the embedding process can not generate a nonzero conductance",
    "if the cluster has a vanishing green function , then the overall conductance is zero for @xmath12=@xmath13 and @xmath50 odd .",
    "the proof of the results of the previous paragraph has been mainly computational , using the entire hilbert space for small values of @xmath50 .",
    "however , a simpler qualitative understanding can be obtained for example considering @xmath50=3 and using ( @xmath81 + @xmath82)/@xmath23 as a simplified @xmath50-particle ground - state @xmath83 . for @xmath84 ,",

    "this @xmath50=3 derivation can easily be extended to arbitrary @xmath50 .",
    "the previous explanation of the anomalous zero conductance emphasizes the competition , and eventual interference , between two states that contribute to the cluster green function .",
    "the key aspect is the relative sign of the matrix elements for the two poles , which leads to interference for an odd number of cluster sites .",
    "let us discuss these aspects more intuitively , and also explain why at @xmath43=0 the effect is not present .",
    "consider as example a 5-site cluster with 3 dots ( schematically + -o - o - o-+ , o = dot , + = lead site ) . at @xmath43=0 this cluster , and any cluster with a total number of sites odd and hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , has a zero energy eigenvalue .",

    "as well , there is a direct channel for conductance through the dots and no cancellation .",
    "however , when @xmath43 is switched on , the degeneracy is removed since there is a penalization for having a site with two electrons ( directly related to an empty site by p - h symmetry ) . the doubly - occupied site , inevitable for @xmath50 + 1 electrons on @xmath50 sites , is located with more probability outside the set of @xmath2 dots , i.e. in the lead segments included in the exactly - solved cluster .",
    "this produces a finite but small splitting @xmath90 , substantially smaller than @xmath43 .",
    "as @xmath43 increases , a kondo peak is formed at @xmath12=@xmath13 , as previously discussed@xcite , but with a dip of width @xmath90 in the middle .",
    "note that for @xmath50 even , there is no zero in the cluster and no dip in the conductance .",
    "however , states approach zero energy as @xmath50 ( even ) increases and eventually as @xmath50@xmath47@xmath91 a common limit of zero conductance for both @xmath50 odd and even is expected .",
    "the @xmath0 cancellation arises from the @xmath43-induced splitting of the @xmath50 + 1 and @xmath50 - 1 states from the @xmath50 ground state .",
    "more intuitively , for charge to transport through a cluster or molecule there are two basic processes , that here interfere . in one case an electron first jump to the cluster , leading to @xmath50 + 1 particles inside , and then an electron exits . in the other case ,",
    "first an electron leaves the cluster ( i.e ( @xmath50 - 1 ) electrons in the cluster intermediate state ) , and then another gets in .",
    "these two intermediate states corresponds to two `` paths '' in a quantum - mechanical formulation , and they do not need actual different real - space trajectories to interfere with one another ( fig .",
    "[ fig6b ] ) .",
    "an alternative explanation of the conductance - cancellation effect described in this paper is the following .",

    "( -1,-2 , ... ) are on the right ( left ) of the central dot , which is left invariant by this transformation",
    ". it can be shown that for just one dot , @xmath96 , the system in the new basis is equivalent to one - dot at the end of a semi - infinite chain coupled to the @xmath97 band , and decoupled from a @xmath98 band ( as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig5f]a , for @xmath51=0 ) .",
    "this geometry corresponds to a one - channel kondo problem , with a concomitant peak in electronic transport . in this new basis ,",
    "the green function used to calculate the conductance can be written as @xmath99=1/2(@xmath100-@xmath101 .",
    "then , an interference in the conductance occurs when @xmath102=@xmath103 .    as discussed in sec.[sec:1dot ] , consider now a diagonal energy @xmath51 at site @xmath8=+1 and @xmath52 at @xmath8=-1 ( i.e. immediately to the right and left of the active dot ) .",
    "transforming the operators , the previously decoupled bands @xmath97 and @xmath98 are now effectively connected by a hopping term of strength @xmath104 ( fig .  [ fig5f]a ) . in this representation , it is easy to visualize a possible interference between processes involving the direct hopping @xmath97@xmath47@xmath98 and those where jumping to and from the dot is part of the path .",

    "fig5f]b ) . at @xmath43@xmath530 a `` many - body '' coupling proportional to @xmath105 links the two channels .",
    "this coupling  too cumbersome to write here explicitly  contains `` spin - flip '' contributions between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , density - density interactions , and even a two - electron hopping term .",
    "the @xmath14-geometry appears once again , suggesting possible interferences , but now with an @xmath97@xmath47@xmath98 effective `` hopping '' which is very complicated .",

    "using numerical techniques , in this paper it has been argued that the conductance kondo peak of an odd number of quantum dots forming a linear array presents nontrivial internal structure in the form of a dip .",
    "the calculation has passed many tests , but the authors acknowledge that the reported result is quite unexpected and for this reason other theoretical techniques should be employed to test our predictions . if the present results are confirmed in the near future , the search for the `` kondo dip '' in experiments should be carried out .",
    "the experimental observation of the conductance dip reported here may require considerable effort .",
    "realizations of the linear - array geometry using atoms and employing stm techniques to measure conductances are difficult .",
    "for instance , atoms attract , and three of them on a metallic surface tend to form triangles rather than chains @xcite .",
    "in addition , finite temperature effects will likely tend to fill the dip in @xmath0 , and temperatures even lower than usually employed will be needed to see the effect . at present , the characteristic energy regulating the width of the dip is still unknown since the method used in the paper works only at zero temperature . in spite of these caveats ,",
    "the interference discussed here is sufficiently novel and interesting that its experimental confirmation and theoretical extension to other types of arrays should be actively pursued .",

    "as discussed in sec.[sec : model ] , the state representing the cluster with an odd number of sites ( and dots ) used in this effort is the equal - weight sum of the states with total @xmath22-component of spin , @xmath106 , equal to 1/2 and -1/2 . by this procedure",

    "however , the location of the zero is different for the two channels , slightly shifted left and right from @xmath107=-0.5 ( see fig.[fig9b ] ) due to the breaking of the particle - hole symmetry . when the two conductances are added ( and dividing by 2 ) , the zeros are no longer present since the `` up '' and `` down '' contributions have the cancellation at different gate voltages . however , even accepting this symmetry - breaking alternative convention to carry out the calculation , two dips are clearly found in the overall result , as also shown in fig.[fig9b ] . it is expected that the two procedures ( with and without explicit particle - hole symmetry in the calculation ) will lead to the same result in the bulk limit , and only further work can clarify which convention is the best given the inevitable size constraints of the present numerical technique",
    ".    finally , to avoid the cluster ground - state ambiguity problem an alternative geometry sketched in the inset of fig.[fig10 ] can be used . in this new system , one extra dot",
    "is laterally coupled to the central dot with a hopping amplitude @xmath108 . clearly , when @xmath109 this system is equivalent to the 3 dots system described in the bulk of the paper . for @xmath107=-0.5 and one particle per site in the cluster , the extra",
    "dot adds one electron to the system studied before giving an @xmath106=0 for the ( nondegenerate ) ground state .",
    "this trick eliminates the `` up '' and `` down '' degeneracy at all finite values of @xmath108 ( while at @xmath108=0 , the degeneracy is recovered ) . repeating the calculation as in fig.[fig2]a",
    ", the conductance for the new system once again presents a symmetric dip for all the values of @xmath108 investigated , even including the very small @xmath108 regime where the extra dot and linear array are nearly decoupled .",
    "then , once again it is concluded that different procedures to carry out the calculations lead all to the same qualitative conclusions .",
    "both figs.[fig9b ] and [ fig10 ] show that the main point of the present paper remains the same irrespective of the convention : the kondo peak of quantum - dot arrays with an odd number of dots appears to have internal structure in the form of dips as the gate voltage is varied .",
