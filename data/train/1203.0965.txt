    "igrj17361 - 4441 is a hard x - ray transient source first observed by @xcite with the ibis / isgri telescope @xcite onboard the _ integral _ satellite @xcite and was quickly recognized to be hosted in the galactic globular cluster ngc 6388 @xcite .    the location of the transient ( close to the globular cluster gravitational center , but see later ) is of great importance since ngc 6388 , among all the globular clusters in our galaxy , is one of the best candidates @xcite to host an intermediate mass black hole ( hereafter imbh ) . in particular , by using high resolution optical observations , @xcite estimated the mass of the imbh to be @xmath7 m@xmath8 .",
    "it would be natural for such an imbh to emit significant radiation in the x - ray band due to the likely accretion of matter from its surroundings . in the context of the earliest observations of globular clusters ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to suggest that the x - ray emission detected towards these clusters was due to imbhs ( in the mass range @xmath9 m@xmath8  @xmath10m@xmath8 ) accreting from the intracluster medium .",
    "this issue was considered more recently by @xcite who provided the census of the compact object and binary population in the globular cluster 47 tuc and obtained an upper limit to the central imbh of a few hundred solar masses .",
    "initial _ xmm_-newton and chandra observations in this direction ( @xcite and @xcite ) showed that the core of ngc 6388 hosts several _",
    "x_-ray sources . based on the correlation between the x - ray and radio flux from black holes ( @xcite )",
    "; @xcite was the first to point out that the search for radio emission from faint black holes is useful to test the imbh hypothesis in globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite observed the central region of ngc 6388 in the radio band using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to search for radio signatures of the imbh .",
    "the radio observation resulted in an upper limit of the imbh mass of @xmath11 m@xmath8 .",
    "the discovery of a transient source close to the ngc 6388 gravitational center could be related to the turning on of the putative globular cluster imbh . however , as will become clear in the subsequent sections , the nature and spectral properties of the transient igrj17361 - 4441 are difficult to reconcile with the imbh picture and rather favour an interpretation as a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) or a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "several observational campaigns ( in the _ x_-rays as well as in the radio band ) were organized in order to pinpoint igrj17361 - 4441 and draw firm conclusions on the ngc 6388 imbh paradigm .    in this paper",
    "we briefly discuss ( see section [ s : previousobs ] ) the past @xmath1-ray observations of the ngc 6388 globular cluster ( see @xcite , and @xcite ) and the discovery of the hard transient igrj17361 - 4441 by _ integral _ ( @xcite ) as well as the follow - up observations conducted by chandra ( @xcite ) , swift / xrt and rxte observatories ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "then we concentrate ( see section [ s : xmmobs ] ) on the analsyis of two _",
    "xmm_-newton slew observations of ngc 6388 conducted 15 days after the _ integral _ discovery of the source .",
    "the two slew observations had @xmath12 seconds and @xmath13 seconds on source exposure time .",
    "finally our conlusions are presented in section [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "by studying a combination of high resolution ( hst acs - hrc , acs - wfc , and wfpc2 ) and wide field ( eso - wfi ) observations of the globular cluster ngc 6388 , @xcite claimed the existence of a central imbh .",
    "such a compact object of mass @xmath7 m@xmath8 should reside in the globular cluster center of gravity ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the black hole mass , the perturber average mass and the stellar velocity dispersion within @xmath17 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath18 is the influence radius of the black hole ( for details see @xcite and references therein ) . ]",
    "localized at the coordinates ( j2000 ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath21 is associated with both coordinates .",
    "@xcite suggested that this imbh should emit radiation in the @xmath1-ray band due to accretion from the surrounding matter . a @xmath22 ks _",
    "xmm_-newton observation was made on 21 march 2003 .",
    "it resulted in a spectrum which was well fit by an absorbed power - law model .",
    "the resulting best fit parameters were @xmath23 @xmath4 for the hydrogen column density and @xmath24 for the power law index .",
    "the unabsorbed flux in the @xmath25 kev band was @xmath26 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 which , for a distance of @xmath27 kpc corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath28 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "note that the hydrogen column density is consistent with the average one found in the direction of the target ( @xcite ) .    the chandra satellite , with a much better angular resolution than that of @xmath2-newton , observed towards ngc 6388 for @xmath29 ks on 21 april 2005 ( i d 5505 ) .",
    "@xcite identified 16 discrete sources within the half mass radius ( @xmath30 , see @xcite ) of the cluster .",
    "the @xmath31 sources close to the gravitational center were not spatially resolved by the authors , so that they were considered virtually as a single source ( labeled as @xmath32 ) .",
    "the unabsorbed flux in the 0.5 - 7 kev band of the @xmath32 is @xmath33 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath34 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "a more detailed analysis on the same chandra data set was conducted by @xcite . after removing the pixel randomization ,",
    "these authors were able to spatially resolve the source @xmath32 into three separate sources labeled as @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , the source @xmath35 , which is consistent with the position of the center of gravity of ngc 6388 , is characterized by an unabsorbed flux of @xmath38 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 corresponding to an intrinsic luminosiy of @xmath39 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite searched for a radio counterpart of the putative imbh in ngc 6388 using the atca facility .",
    "unfortunately , this search only resulted in an upper limit to the radio flux at 5 ghz of @xmath40 @xmath41jy / beam .",
    "therefore , it was only possible to determine an upper limit to the imbh radio luminosity of @xmath42 erg s@xmath5 .    based on the fundamental plane of black hole accretion ( @xcite and @xcite ) and using the observed @xmath1-ray and radio luminosities , it was then possible to put a 3@xmath16 upper limit of @xmath11 m@xmath8 on the mass of the imbh in ngc 6388 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated mass value has to be treated with caution for two reasons : _ i _ ) the identification of the @xmath1-ray counterpart of such a black hole is not trivial since several sources are close to the ngc 6388 center of gravity .",
    "if none of them are associated with the imbh , then one can not use the fundamental plane relation to get an estimate of the mass ; _ ii _ ) the fundamental plane relation ( as derived by @xcite and @xcite ) is not tested for black hole masses in the range of interest for imbhs , i.e. @xmath43 m@xmath8  @xmath44 m@xmath8 .",
    "note however that @xcite and @xcite showed that the non - detection of a radio source , in combination with the estimate of the globular cluster ism density and the expected value of the accretion rate , can be used to get information ( at least as an order of magnitude estimate ) of the imbh mass .",
    "on 11 august 2011 , @xcite reported the discovery of a new hard @xmath1-ray transient ( igrj17361 - 4441 ) by the ibis / isgri telescope @xcite onboard the _ integral _ satellite @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the source , associated with the globular cluster ngc 6388 , was described by a power law with photon index @xmath45 and characterized by a flux in the 20 - 100 kev of @xmath46 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 .",
    "since this newly discovered transient is possibly associated with the imbh in ngc 6388 , igrj17361 - 4441 became the target of several @xmath1-ray follow - up observations aimed at obtaining accurate position and flux measurements to test if this association is correct .",
    "@xcite ( but see also @xcite ) reported a swift / xrt observation ( 1.9 ks on 16 august 2011 ) in which the astrometrically corrected position of igrj17361 - 4441 was @xmath47 , @xmath20 .",
    "a more detailed analysis on the xrt data conducted by @xcite determined the new transient position to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 with an associated error ( on both coordinates ) of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the distance and @xmath51 coordinates . ] of the transient from the center of gravity of ngc 6388 is @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the source position is consistent ( according to the swift / xrt data ) with the center of gravity of the cluster and ( possibly ) associated with the imbh .",
    "note also that a 2.5 ks chandra observation was made on 29 august 2011 ( @xcite ) in order to improve the accuracy of the location of the transient .",
    "igrj17361 - 4441 is located at the coordinates @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( the nominal chandra positional accuracy is @xmath55 on both coordinates ) . in this case",
    ", the estimated distance of the transient to the cluster center of gravity is @xmath56 .",
    "based on the swift / xrt astrometry only , one could conclude that the position of igrj17361 - 4441 is formally consistent with the center of gravity of ngc 6388 and possibly related to the putative imbh in the globular cluster . an updated radio observation conducted at atca by @xcite put a more stringent upper limit to the radio luminosity of @xmath57 erg s@xmath5 so that , following the same procedure as in @xcite and the 2005 chandra @xmath1-ray flux estimate , the new imbh upper limit turns out to be @xmath58 m@xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a caveat on this conclusion is necessary .",
    "the new chandra refined source coordinates ( even if formally consistent with the source position determined by swift / xrt ) indicate that the transient could be a new @xmath1-ray source ( see later ) not associated with the imbh . in this case , and for the reasons explained above , one should not use the black hole fundamental plane relation in order to estimate the imbh mass .",
    "if one believes that the transient is associated with the ngc 6388 center of gravity , then it should also be noted that at least three sources ( those labeled as @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 in @xcite ) are within the error box of swift / xrt . in particular , sources @xmath35 and @xmath36 have fluxes @xmath59 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 and @xmath60 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , respectively . if source @xmath61 is associated with the imbh , the @xmath1-ray and radio observations together with the fundamental plane relation give an upper limit of @xmath62 m@xmath8 .",
    "the swift / xrt spectrum of the transient source was fitted ( @xcite ) with an absorbed power law with photon index @xmath63 and hydrogen column density @xmath64 @xmath4 , i.e. consistent with that derived from the previous @xmath2-newton data .",
    "the flux in the @xmath65 kev band is @xmath66 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , a factor @xmath67 more luminous than the source @xmath35 possibly associated with the ngc 6388 imbh ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the broad band spectrum ( obtained by using swift / xrt and _ integral / isgri _ ) was analysed ( and fit with a broken power law ) , @xcite obtained a flux of @xmath68 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 in the @xmath65 kev band and a flux of @xmath69 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 in the @xmath70 kev band .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained by using the xrte / pca follow - up observation made on 17 august 2011 .",
    "in particular , it was found that @xmath71 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 in the @xmath72 kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large collecting area of the nested mirrors together with the high quantum efficiency of the epic / pn camera make the @xmath2-newton satellite the most sensitive @xmath1-ray observatory available at present ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2-newton satellite was recognized to be a good instrument to collect data during slewing manoeuvres and is performing an @xmath1-ray survey of the sky ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the @xmath2-newton slew observations are moderately deep with a detection limit of @xmath73 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 in the @xmath74 kev band .",
    "due to the scheduled observation program , the @xmath2-newton satellite twice observed the region of the sky around ngc 6388 .",
    "the observations were taken on september 1@xmath75 2011 at 13:10:34 ( herafter s1 observation ) and 19:00:17 ( ut ) ( herafter s2 observation ) , i.e. 15 days after the first swift / xrt follow - up observation of igrj17361 - 4441 .",
    "the transient source was then observed serendipitously deg h@xmath5 .",
    "the resulting exposure times were also corrected for chip gaps and bad pixels ( for details see @xcite ) . ] for @xmath12 s and @xmath13 s in the two slew observations with the epic / pn instrument ( see fig . [ f0 ] ) .",
    "we decided to analyze the data sets separately in order to study a possible spectral variation on time - scales of hours .",
    "the source spectrum has been extracted from a circle of radius @xmath76 about the source with the background being extracted from an annulus of inner radius @xmath77 and outer radius @xmath78 about the source .",
    "the detector matrices are calculated taking into account the transit of the source across the detector and using the method described in @xcite .",
    "hence , the source and background spectra ( as well as the response matrices ) were imported in the xspec package ( version 12.4.0 ) for the spectral analysis and fitting procedure .",
    "the adopted model is an absorbed power law ( _ wabs*power _ ) with the hydrogen column density fixed to the average value found by rosat in the direction of the target , i.e. @xmath79 @xmath4 .",
    "note that this value is consistent with that derived by @xcite when analyzing the 2005 @xmath2-newton observation of ngc 6388 and also similar to the column density found by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) while studying the swift / xrt follow - up observation of igrj17361 - 4441 .",
    "the adopted model has two free parameters ; the photon index @xmath80 and the power law normalization @xmath81 .",
    "the fitting procedure to the s1 spectrum resulted in the best fit parameters ( @xmath82 for 11 d.o.f . )",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the absorbed fluxes in the @xmath85 kev , @xmath86 kev , and @xmath87 kev bands are @xmath88 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , @xmath89 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , and @xmath90 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "fitting the s2 spectrum with the same model gives the best fit parameters ( @xmath91 for 10 d.o.f . ) @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the absorbed fluxes in the same bands as above are @xmath94 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , @xmath95 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , and @xmath96 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the maximum unabsorbed flux of the source in the 0.5 - 10 kev band is @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath97 erg s@xmath5 .    in figure",
    "[ f3 ] , the unabsorbed x - ray fluxes of ngc 6388 in the @xmath98 kev band ( from 2003 to 2011 ) are shown . in the insert ,",
    "we give the data points corresponding to the igrj17361 - 4441 flare observed and monitored by several instruments ( swift / xrt , rxte / pca and @xmath2-newton ) in 2011 only . note that for the @xmath2-newton observation in 2003 , the chandra observation in 2005 , and the swift and rxte in 2011 the @xmath98 kev band fluxes were obtained by extrapolating ( to this energy band ) the best fit models available in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "what can be easily observed from the results reported here , is that the @xmath1-ray flux in the 0.5 - 10 kev band as detected by the @xmath2-newton slew observations , i.e. @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , is consistent with that observed by swift / xrt 15 days earlier .",
    "note also that the spectrum power - law seems to be marginally consistent ( @xmath6 ) with that derived from the previous high energy observations ( @xmath99 , see @xcite ) , a point that could help in a classification of the transient nature ( see the subsequent discussion ) .",
    "igrj17361 - 4441 is a hard transient recently observed by the @xmath0 satellite . @xmath1-ray",
    "follow - up observations have shown that the source is within the globular cluster ngc 6388 .",
    "based only on the astrometry of the swift / xrt satellite , the transient position is consistent with the center of gravity of the globular cluster and this opens the possibility that igrj17361 - 4441 is associated with an imbh which is turning on .",
    "however , if one believes that the transient is associated with the imbh in ngc 6388 , then it should be noted that at least three @xmath1-ray sources ( those labeled as @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 in @xcite ) are within the error box of swift / xrt . in particular , the sources @xmath35 and @xmath36 have fluxes which differ at least by a factor @xmath100 between them . if source @xmath36 is associated with the imbh , then the observed chandra @xmath1-ray flux ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and the updated radio observation of @xcite together with the fundamental plane relation give an upper limit of @xmath62 m@xmath8 .    in the imbh hypothesis ,",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of the source as determined by using the @xmath2-newton slew data ( i.e. @xmath97 erg s@xmath5 ) should be compared with that derived by using the 2005 chandra data ( and in particular for the source @xmath35 in @xcite ) when the putative imbh was in quiescent state . in this case",
    ", one finds that the source luminosity increased by at least a factor @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , the spectrum seems to follow a power law with photon index @xmath102 .",
    "nevertheless , the refined source position given by the chandra satellite ( even if still in agreement with the swift / xrt result ) argues against the imbh hypothesis in favor of a newly discovered source . in this case , the @xmath2-newton intrinsic source luminosity should be compared with the upper limit for the quiescent state of the source .",
    "@xcite , based on the non - detection of the source in the 2005 chandra observation , estimated this limit to be @xmath103erg s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , in this case the transient source has increased its luminosity by a factor close to @xmath104 .",
    "the first possibility is actually unlikely since these systems involve companion stars with mass larger than @xmath105 m@xmath8 ( @xcite ) , i.e. o / b stars which are not expected to exist in globular clusters .",
    "note also that ngc 6388 was extensively observed by the hst instruments ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the collected data did not show the presence of any o or b star in the globular cluster .",
    "hence , among the imbh alternatives , the lmxb option is the most favorable .",
    "this is supported by the @xmath1-ray luminosity ( @xmath97 erg s@xmath5 ) and by the soft spectrum ( @xmath6 ) observed in the @xmath2-newton slew observation which seems to be consistent with the typical characteristics of the lmxb class of objects . a long @xmath1-ray observation ( sufficient to allow a detailed timing and spectral analysis )",
    "may help in understanding the physics underlying this transient source ."
