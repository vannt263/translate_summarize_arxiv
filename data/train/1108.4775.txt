    "coherent electronic transport through mesoscopic rings or structures with non - trivial geometries has been extensively investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in last decades .",
    "the studies have aimed at exploring theoretically the quantum interference in solid - state circuits and also revolutionizing electronic devices in such a way to exploit the quantum effects . at the heart of studies of mesoscopic rings , there are two hallmarks of quantum coherence : the aharonov - bohm @xcite ( ab ) and aharonov - casher @xcite ( ac ) effects .",
    "two effects are related to geometric phases due to the coupling of a charge to a magnetic flux and of a spin degree of freedom to an electric field via spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , respectively . since the ab oscillation in conductance through normal - metal rings was revealed , @xcite it is found that the effects can lead to diverse quantum interference effects such as conductance fluctuations , @xcite persistent charge and spin current , @xcite ab effect for exciton , @xcite mesoscopic kondo effect , @xcite spin switch , @xcite spin filter , @xcite and spin hall effect .",
    "@xcite from a practical point of view , the quantum coherent phenomena in mesoscopic rings , especially using the spin degrees of freedom , have been applied to the fast growing field of spintronics @xcite and are now known to provide the easy - to - control devices that generate , manipulate , and detect the spin - dependent current or signal .",
    "mesoscopic rings fabricated in semiconductors offer intriguing possibility to study simultaneously the ab and ac effects because of spin - orbit coupling naturally formed in crystals .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling itself can have various forms in different materials , leading to diverse current oscillations.@xcite in addition , the strength of the spin - orbit coupling can be controlled by tuning a backgate voltage to the device .",
    "@xcite among spin - orbit couplings , the rashba soc , originating from the broken structural inversion symmetry , is linear in momentum and easy to analyze .",
    "the studies of spin interference @xcite subject to the rashba soc have shown that the rashba coupling strength can modulate the unpolarized current , suggesting the possibility of all - electrical spintronic devices .",
    "recently , a number of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have investigated transport of heavy holes in rings , whose soc is cubic in momentum . in the presence of external magnetic fields ,",
    "the zeeman splitting is operative together with the socs and its effect should be taken into account .",
    "@xcite    the general framework for the theoretical studies of the mesoscopic transport relies on the landauer approach , @xcite and it is described as tunneling through conduction modes between the source and drain electrodes coupled to rings . in the coherent regime , the tunneling is accompanied by interference between conduction modes .",
    "the conductance is then described by a scattering matrix between modes that carry distinct phases . due to interference",
    ", the fact that each of the modes is charge conserving does not guarantee the charge conservation in the total transport . more specifically , a problem arises when the ring modes form nonorthogonal spin textures ; the spins of the states with the same energy are not orthogonal at every point .",
    "such a complexity does not arise if the ring has either of the linear - in - momentum socs ( like the rashba soc ) or the zeeman splitting because one can then diagonalize the system hamiltonian such that no mode mixing takes place .",
    "however , in realistic situations with arbitrary form of soc and zeeman splitting , the mode mixing , or spin mixing , naturally exists .",
    "the previous studies considering both the effect of the rashba soc and the zeeman splitting have dealt with this situation by using the transfer - matrix method accompanied with wave function matching , @xcite perturbative approach , @xcite and path - integral approach .",
    "@xcite the transfer - matrix method , even though different group velocities of ring modes are taken into account , fails guaranteeing the charge conservation at the lead - ring junction . in their studies ,",
    "the relation between the lead and the ring modes are determined solely by the wave function matching , which alone can not satisfy the charge conservation .",
    "the perturbative calculation is valid only in the small zeeman splitting limit .",
    "finally , the path - integral approach , which may be conceptually useful to interpret the result in terms of phases , is limited by its semiclassical treatment .",
    "our goal in this work is to find a general scattering matrix formalism that guarantees the charge conservation at the lead - ring junctions by its own way of construction in the presence of arbitrary spin interactions .",
    "we detour the mode mixing problem by introducing artificial spin - independent _ buffer _ regions in the vicinity of every junction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the mode - mixing effect is then taken care of at the interfaces between the buffers and the spinful regions in a standard way .",
    "finally , the original system is recovered in the limit of vanishing buffers . by using our formalism",
    ", we first recover the known results in the case of orthogonal spin textures and interpret the role of buffers added by hand .",
    "secondly , we apply our formalism to the @xmath0-type semiconductor ring with both the rashba soc and the zeeman splitting .",
    "we found that ( 1 ) our formalism truly guarantees the charge conservation at every junction , giving rise to correct predictions , ( 2 ) the spin - flip scattering can happen even if the junctions are nonmagnetic , ( 3 ) the ring interferometer can act as conditional / unconditional spin switch in the weak / strong - coupling regimes , respectively , if some conditions are met .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : our formalism is introduced and derived in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : orthogonal ] the case of orthogonal spin texture is treated within our formalism .",
    "section  [ sec : nonorthogonal ] is devoted to the study of a case of nonorthogonal spin states in which both the rashba soc and the zeeman splitting are taken into account .",
    "finally , we conclude and summarize our paper in sec .",

    ".,width=302 ]    the scattering in the mesoscopic system is frequently characterized in terms of the scattering matrix which defines the relative amplitudes and phases of the scatted states to the injected states .",
    "the scattering matrix depends on the details of the system but is constrained by the laws of conservation .",
    "the most important properties that the scattering matrix obeys are the current conservation , if there is neither a source or a sink in scatterer and , additionally the spin current conservation , if the scatterer is nonmagnetic .",
    "the conservation conditions , together with some symmetric arguments , quite simplify the form of the scattering matrix so that it can be described by a few parameters . for example , the most frequently used scattering matrix for the ab interferometer is controlled by a single parameter @xmath1 that is varied between 0 ( no tunneling ) and 1/2 ( perfect tunneling ) . here the scattering to and from upper and lower arms is assumed to be symmetric .",
    "this simple construction of the scattering matrix can be extended further to the magnetic case where spin - dependent interactions exist in the arms . in the presence of the zeeman splitting",
    ", one can treat the scattering of spin up and down separately , each of which is described by the simple scattering matrix mentioned before . for the case of linear - in - momentum spin - orbit coupling such as the rashba soc",
    ", one can identify a common spin polarization axis at a junction so that spin - separate treatment is still possible .",
    "no difficulty in defining the scattering matrix that satisfies the conservation laws arises as long as all the arms meeting at a junction share a single spin polarization axis .",
    "however , the latter condition is quite fragile and generally fails in the presence of general spin - dependent interactions in the arms .",
    "the simplest case in which it happens is the ring with both the rashba soc and the zeeman splitting .",
    "as will be shown later , the ring eigenstates are neither parallel or orthogonal to each other in the spin space at all , denying a common spin polarization axis .",
    "the scattering into the ring then involves all the spin states , preventing spin - separate treatment .",
    "the scattering matrix is then complicated although it should still fulfill the conservation laws .",
    "one can then issue several questions .",
    "is there a general framework to build the spin - dependent scattering matrix , which guarantees satisfying the conservation laws by the way of its construction ?",
    "what is the smallest number of controlling parameters that are required to describe the scattering in the presence of arbitrary spin - dependent interactions ?",
    "can the spin - flip scattering happen even if the scatterer itself is still nonmagnetic ?    in order to answer these questions",
    "we propose a general formalism to build up a consistent ( spin - dependent ) scattering matrix for arbitrary spin interaction .",
    "the key idea of our method is to insert artificial buffer regions between the scatter and arms as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the buffer regions are assumed to be free of any spin - dependent interaction .",
    "hence , the scattering between buffer regions can be described by the simple spin - separate scattering matrix .",
    "the complexity due to the spin - dependent interaction makes its effect at interfaces between buffers and arms .",
    "the wave functions at interfaces are matched in the systematic way by using the continuity of wave function and its current density .",
    "this wave matching , together with the scattering matrix between buffer states , leads one to find the scattering matrix between states of arms .",
    "the size of artificial buffers is then shrunken to zero in order to recover the original configuration .",
    "the shrinking does not remove all the effects of buffers because the effect of scattering at buffer - arm interfaces still remains . in the end , the scattering matrix connecting states of arms is constructed .",
    "the advantages of our methods are listed as follows : ( 1 ) the scattering matrix obtained guarantees satisfying the conservation laws .",
    "it is because the scattering between buffer states and the scattering at buffer - arm interfaces are set up to conserve the charge and spin currents .",
    "( 2 ) it systematically identifies the minimal set of controlling parameters that the scatterer can have .",
    "( 3 ) it provides the reasonable explanation for the effect of spin interactions in arms on the spin - dependent ( possibly spin - flip ) scattering even when the scatterer itself is nonmagnetic .    in the following sections we build up our formalism , especially focusing on the ab interferometer shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the system consists of two leads and one ring .",
    "each part is assumed to be narrow enough to be regarded as one - dimensional conductor with a single transverse mode .",
    "the scattering matrix between lead and ring then becomes a @xmath2 matrix .",
    "we will construct a general scattering matrix for ring with arbitrary spin interaction .",
    "our formalism , however , is quite general and can be applied to mesoscopic circuits with any kind of geometry .",

    "they are free of any magnetic interaction , and their hamiltonians read @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the effective mass of electrons in the leads and @xmath6 is the minimum energy of the transverse mode . thanks to the spin degeneracy , the spin polarization axis of eigenstates can be chosen arbitrarily .",
