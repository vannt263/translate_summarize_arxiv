    "restriction problem_. given a surface @xmath0 embedded in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , one asks for which exponents @xmath3 , @xmath4 the fourier transform of a function @xmath5 belongs to @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is endowed with its @xmath7-dimensional lebesgue measure @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , defining the restriction operator @xmath9 as @xmath10 for all @xmath11 in the schwartz class , the problem is to know when @xmath9 can be extended as a bounded operator from @xmath12 to @xmath6 .",
    "the operator dual to @xmath9 is called the _ extension operator _ , which we denote by @xmath13 , and satisfies the identity @xmath14 for all @xmath15 .",
    "the restriction problem is thus equivalent to knowing when @xmath13 is bounded from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a wide review of results concerning this problem and its motivations .    a model case of the restriction problem which is often considered in the literature is the case @xmath18 .",
    "there are two types of surfaces for which this problem has been completely settled . for smooth compact surfaces with non - zero gauss curvature , the celebrated stein ",
    "tomas theorem @xcite states that the restriction problem has a positive answer if and only if @xmath19 . for quadratic surfaces ,",
    "strichartz @xcite gave a complete answer depending on the type of the surface ( paraboloid - like , cone - like , or sphere - like , see below for a more precise definition ) .",
    "hence , in these cases we know exactly for which exponents @xmath20 the inequality @xmath21 holds for all @xmath22 with @xmath23 independent of @xmath11 .",
    "the question we want to address in this work is a generalization of to systems of orthonormal functions .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath24 a ( possibly infinite ) orthonormal system in @xmath25 , and let @xmath26 be a family of coefficients .",
    "we prove inequalities of the form @xmath27 for some @xmath28 , with @xmath23 independent of @xmath29 , @xmath30 . to appreciate the difference between and , notice that combining with the triangle inequality in @xmath31 leads to the estimate @xmath32 which is weaker than ( since we will prove with @xmath33 ) .",
    "this difference is particularly important when the number of non - zero @xmath34 is infinite , which happens in some applications that we will discuss below . in the case of smooth compact surfaces with non - zero gauss curvature we will prove with the _ optimal _ ( that is , largest possible ) exponent @xmath35 .",
    "generalizing functional inequalities involving a single function to systems of orthonormal functions is not a new topic .",
    "it is strongly motivated by the study of many - body systems in quantum mechanics , where a simple description of @xmath36 independent fermionic particles is given by @xmath36 orthonormal functions in some @xmath37-space .",
    "it is then important to obtain functional inequalities on these systems whose behaviour is optimal in the number @xmath36 of such functions . typically , this behaviour is better than the one given by the triangle inequality .",
    "the first example of such a generalization is the lieb  thirring inequality @xcite , which states that for any @xmath38 orthonormal in @xmath39 and for any non - negative coefficients @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 its counterpart for a single function is the gagliardo  nirenberg  sobolev inequality , @xmath42 which together with the triangle inequality implies @xmath43 which is weaker than .",
    "thirring inequalities are a decisive tool for proving stability of matter @xcite .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that is _ not _ enough to prove stability of matter . the homogeneous sobolev inequality for @xmath44 , @xmath45 also has a generalization to several functions which was proved by lieb @xcite : for any @xmath38 orthonormal in @xmath39 and for any non - negative coefficients @xmath40 , we have @xmath46 again , combining with the triangle inequality leads to the estimate @xmath47 which is weaker than . finally , a recent work by frank , lewin , lieb , and seiringer @xcite generalizes the strichartz inequality @xmath48 to orthonormal functions @xmath38",
    "in @xmath39 with complex coefficients @xmath40 : @xmath49 these generalized strichartz estimates were used in @xcite to study the nonlinear evolution of quantum systems with an infinite number of particles .",
    "our motivation to prove inequalities of the form is threefold .",
    "harmonic analysis tools are widely used in nonlinear problems . with a perspective to study nonlinear many - body problems , it is thus natural to understand the model restriction problem in this many - body context . in a more concrete approach ,",
    "it was noticed by strichartz @xcite that the restriction problem for some quadratic surfaces is linked to space - time decay estimates for some evolution equations . as a consequence",
    ", we will see that when @xmath0 is one of these quadratic surfaces also has an interpretation in terms of solutions to evolution equations .",
    "in particular , we provide a new proof of the strichartz inequality which furthermore includes the _ full range of exponents _ where it is valid . as in the original article of strichartz",
    ", this also provides new strichartz inequalities for orthonormal functions for the fractional laplacian @xmath50 and for the pseudo - relativistic operator @xmath51 . finally , we present a general principle which allows to obtain bounds of the kind , not necessarily in the context of the extension operator .",
    "the advantage of this principle is that it allows to deduce _ automatically _ bounds for orthonormal systems from bounds for a single function , if these latter were proved by a certain method based on complex interpolation .",
    "let us now provide some insight about this principle .",
    "one of the reasons why the case @xmath18 of the restriction problem is better understood is that we can compose the maps @xmath13 and @xmath52 . in particular , @xmath13 is bounded from @xmath25 to @xmath17 if and only if @xmath53 is bounded from @xmath12 to @xmath17",
    ". stein @xcite and strichartz @xcite prove the boundedness of @xmath54 by introducing an analytic family of operators @xmath55 defined on a strip @xmath56 in the complex plane , such that @xmath57 for some @xmath58 .",
    "they prove that @xmath59 is a bounded operator from @xmath37 to @xmath37 on the line @xmath60 and from @xmath61 to @xmath62 on the line @xmath63 .",
    "using stein s interpolation theorem @xcite , they deduce that @xmath57 is bounded from @xmath64 to @xmath65 for some exponent @xmath20 , which turns out to be the optimal one .",
    "now notice that hlder s inequality implies that @xmath54 is bounded from @xmath12 to @xmath17 if and only if for any @xmath66 , the operator @xmath67 is bounded from @xmath68 to @xmath68 with the estimate @xmath69 with @xmath23 independent of @xmath70 .    our key contribution is to show that the operator @xmath67 is more than a mere bounded operator on @xmath37 , namely that it belongs to a schatten class . recall that the schatten class @xmath71 , @xmath72 , is defined as the space of all compact operators on @xmath68 such that the sequence of their singular values belongs to @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath74-norm of such an operator is then the @xmath73-norm of its singular values .",
    "the estimate that we prove is @xmath75 with @xmath23 independent of @xmath70 .",
    "of course , implies and is hence stronger . by a well - known duality argument ( see lemma [ lemma : duality - principle ] below ) , the bound is equivalent to a bound of the kind for systems of orthonormal functions .",
    "the estimate follows from a general principle which states that , as soon as a linear operator @xmath76 belongs to an analytic family of operators of the same type as the one we described above , then the operator @xmath77 satisfies a bound of the form . as we explained , under such assumptions on @xmath76 , stein s interpolation theorem would typically imply that @xmath76 is bounded from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "our main input is to notice that @xmath76 actually satisfies a stronger schatten bound .",
    "this general principle does not depend on the fact that @xmath54 can be decomposed as @xmath78 .",
    "this decomposition is only necessary to deduce from .",
    "however , the schatten bound has an interest by itself , even when it holds for an operator @xmath76 which is not of the form @xmath79 .",
    "an example of such an operator is given by the resolvent of the laplacian on @xmath1 , @xmath80 in @xcite , kenig , ruiz , and sogge prove the bound @xmath81 for a range of exponents @xmath20 which depends on @xmath82 .",
    "when @xmath83 varies away from a neighborhood of the origin , these bounds are uniform in @xmath83 and hence were labeled _",
    "uniform sobolev estimates_. in @xcite , the authors used them to prove unique continuation results for solutions to schrdinger equations , but numerous other applications of these estimates were later found .",
    "for instance , they were part of goldberg and schlag s proof of the limiting absorption principle in @xmath64 spaces @xcite ; see also @xcite . in @xcite , they were used to control the size of eigenvalues of schrdinger operators with complex - valued potentials . in this paper",
    ", we show that the boundedness statement contained in can be upgraded to a quantitative compactness statement .",
    "that is , we prove a schatten bound of the type for @xmath84 , using our general principle . as an application of this",
    ", we then deduce from it a version of the limiting absorption principle in schatten spaces .",
    "this will allow us to prove optimal bounds on the scattering matrix for schrdinger operators . as another application",
    ", we will prove bounds for _ sums _ of eigenvalues of schrdinger operators with complex - valued potentials .",
    "these bounds control the accumulation of eigenvalues at points in @xmath85 in a significantly better way than previous bounds .",
    "the organization of the article is the following , with the corresponding main results of each section :    * in section [ sec : complex - interpolation ] , we first explain our general principle ( proposition [ prop : complex - interpolation ] ) from which the schatten bounds follow .",
    "we then apply this principle to various situations .",
    "+ * in section [ sec : restriction ] , we prove restriction theorems for systems of orthonormal functions ( theorem [ thm : restriction - orthonormal ] ) .",
    "we also prove a result about the optimality of these estimates ( theorem [ thm : optimality - schatten - exponent ] ) .",
    "+ * in section [ sec : strichartz ] , we extend the strichartz inequalities of @xcite to the full range of exponents ( theorem [ thm : strichartz - orthonormal - general ] ) .",
    "we furthermore prove new strichartz inequalities for systems of orthonormal functions , for the operators @xmath50 ( theorem [ thm : strichartz - orthonormal - fractional ] ) and @xmath51 ( theorem [ thm : strichartz - orthonormal - pseudo - relativistic ] ) . + * in section [ sec : sobolev ] , we prove uniform sobolev estimates in schatten spaces ( theorem [ thm : uniform - sobolev - schatten ] ) , and apply them to prove a limiting absorption principle in schatten spaces ( theorem [ thm : lap ] ) . + * in section [ sec : hartree ] , we give an application of strichartz estimates to well - posedness of the non - linear hartree equation in schatten spaces ( theorem [ thm : gwp - hartree ] ) . + * in section [ sec : lt ] , we give another application of uniform sobolev estimates to lieb  thirring inequalities for schrdinger operators with complex - valued potentials ( theorem [ thm : lt - complex ] ) . + * in section [ sec : scatmat ] , we finally give an application of the limiting absorption principle to schatten estimates of the scattering matrix ( theorem [ thm : scatmat ] ) .",
    "in this section , we explain how to obtain schatten bounds of the form by a complex interpolation method .",
    "the advantage of this result is that it requires assumptions that are naturally proved when one wants to show that a given operator is bounded from @xmath12 to @xmath17 by a complex interpolation method .",
    "hence , it provides an automatic way to upgrade this @xmath86 bound into a stronger schatten bound .",
    "let us first recall that a family of operators @xmath55 on @xmath1 defined on a strip @xmath87 in the complex plane ( @xmath88 ) is analytic in the sense of stein @xcite if for all simple functions @xmath89 on @xmath1 ( that is , functions that take a finite number of nonzero values on sets of finite measure in @xmath90 , the map @xmath91 is analytic in @xmath92 , continuous in @xmath93 , and if @xmath94 for some @xmath95 with at most a ( double ) exponential growth in @xmath96 .",
