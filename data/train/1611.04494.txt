    "this paper contributes to the performance valuation of portfolio strategies under forward investment performance criteria .",
    "these criteria are modeled as a stochastic process , @xmath0 which propagates forward in time  in a time - consistent manner as market evolves .",
    "specifically , @xmath1 is a forward performance process , with respect to an underlying filtration @xmath2 if for any admissible wealth process , say @xmath3 with @xmath4 being an investment strategy , the process @xmath5 is a supermartingale , and there exists a strategy @xmath6 for which @xmath7 becomes a martingale . in essence , the forward performance process is self - generated  by ensuring that the dynamic programming principle holds for any arbitrary trading period .",
    "the value function process in the classical expected utility paradigm is an example of a forward performance , if one requires that at the end of the horizon @xmath8 is a given deterministic ( @xmath9 -mble ) function .",
    "the motivation to develop forward performance criteria is threefold .",
    "firstly , it is frequently difficult to assess and specify the utility function in a ( possibly remote ) future time .",
    "it is more plausible to know the utility , or the preferred allocations , for the immediate future or for the upcoming period ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , in the classical expected utility setting , one needs to pre - commit to a market model for the entire investment period , say @xmath10 .$ ] even if one allows for model uncertainty , the choice of the set of possible models is still biding @xcite .",
    "more generally , uncertainty might be generated by both asset evolution and exogenous factors , and it is quite difficult to model them accurately especially for a long time ahead ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thirdly , it is often the case , for example in risk measures , indifference valuation and in investment with rolling horizons , that horizon flexibility is desired , a feature not present in the classical setting ( see , among others , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "forward investment performance criteria were introduced by one of the authors and musiela in @xcite and @xcite , and we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for further details .",
    "with the exception of the discrete exponential case , studied in @xcite and @xcite , in the context of exponential indifference prices , the existing results have so far focused exclusively on continuous - time settings in ito - diffusion markets , in which both trading and performance valuation are done continuously in time .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the forward performance process is associated with an ill - posed stochastic pde which has been subsequently studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . despite the technical challenges that this forward performance spde presents ( ill - posedness , degeneracies and volatility specification ) the continuous - time cases are tractable because stochastic calculus can be employed and infinitesimal arguments are , in turn , developed .",
    "however , continuous - time settings might not be adequately useful for applications .",
    "indeed , in investment practice , trading occurs at discrete times and not continuously .",
    "more importantly , performance criteria are directly or indirectly determined by individuals , such as higher - level managers or clients , that are different from the portfolio manager .",
    "these performance evaluators  use information sets that are different , both in terms of contents and updating frequency , from the ones used by the portfolio manager .",
    "for example , a portfolio manager may have access to various data sets , proprietary forecasting models , and sophisticated trading strategies which are out of reach of ( or simply deemed as too detailed  to be considered by ) the performance evaluator .",
    "similarly , even if trading can happen at extremely higher frequencies ( hence almost close to continuous trading ) , performance assessment takes place at a much slower pace , e.g. a senior manager will not keep track of the performance of a portfolio as frequently as the subordinate portfolio manager in charge of that portfolio .    the aim herein is to initiate the development and a systematic study of investment performance processes that are _ discrete _ in time , while trading can be either discrete or continuous . within this class ,",
    "we first introduce forward performance processes that are _ predictable _ with regards to the information at the most recent assessment time .",
    "namely , if @xmath11 are the performance evaluation times , then we require that , for @xmath12 @xmath13 is @xmath14-mble .",
    "we are motivated to introduce this class of criteria for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it is natural to define at the beginning of the assessment period the criterion we use for the end of it .",
    "this is , for example , the case in the expected utility framework where there is only one evaluation period and the terminal utility is deterministic ( @xmath9-mble ) .    secondly , it is more feasible to estimate the market parameters for just one evaluation period ahead , than for longer periods .",
    "for example , the volatility can be reliably forecasted for a short time ahead using the so - called realized volatility introduced by the seminal work @xcite .",
    "similarly , short - term predictability of equity risk premium has been subject to extended studies in the last three decades ( see , among others , @xcite ) and is consistent with how active investors such as hedge funds operate .    to highlight the key ideas of predictable forward investment processes we start our analysis with a simple but still rich enough setting .",
    "the market consists of two securities , a riskless asset and a stock whose price evolves according to a binomial model at times @xmath15 , at which the forward evaluation also occurs .",
    "the market model is more general than the standard one , in that the asset return , say @xmath16 during @xmath17 takes values @xmath18 that are @xmath19mble , with `` probability '' @xmath20 which is also @xmath21-mble .",
    "this setting allows for updating of returns and their probabilities , as the market enfolds from one evaluation period to the next .    as we show in section [ sec : problem ] , the investor starts at @xmath22 and chooses ( i.e. estimates ) the market parameters @xmath23 for the upcoming trading / evaluation period @xmath24 she also chooses her initial deterministic utility , say @xmath25 and seeks a utility ( performance ) function @xmath26 also deterministic , since @xmath27 such that the pair @xmath28 is consistent with the investment problem in @xmath29 , $ ] with @xmath30 being respectively the value function and terminal utility .    in turn , at @xmath31 the agent observes @xmath32 for the next period @xmath33 she then solves a similar `` inverse investment problem '' for a pair @xmath34 with @xmath35 to be determined , starting with initial wealth @xmath36 generated at the end of the previous period . proceeding iteratively _ forward in time _",
    ", a predictable investment criterion is constructed together with the optimal allocations and their wealths .",
    "the underlying optimization problem then is a _ single - period inverse investment _ problem , which needs to be solved `` period - by - period '' conditionally on the information at the beginning of the period .",
    "we analyze this problem in detail .",
    "the key equation turns out to be a linear functional equation , which relates the inverse marginal processes , at the beginning and the end of each trading period , with coefficients depending on market inputs , see .",
    "we analyze this equation in detail , and establish conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions in the class of inverse marginal functions , see theorems [ thm : existenceofinvmarginal ] and [ thm : imp ] .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : def ] , we introduce the notion of predictable forward performance processes in a general market setting .",
    "we consider a binomial model with random parameters in section [ sec : binomial ] . in section [ sec :",
    "problem ] , we apply the definition of predictable forward performance processes to the binomial model , and show that their construction reduces to solving an inverse investment problem . in section [ sec : imp ] , the inverse problem is shown to be equivalent to an iterative ( i.e. single variable ) functional equation . sufficient existence and uniqueness condition as well as the explicit solution to the functional equation are derived in section [ sec : funeq ] .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "proofs of the main theorems are included in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we propose the definition of predictable forward performance processes in a rather general market model . in the next sections , we restrict the market setting to a binomial model and provide a detail discussion on existence and construction of these performance processes .",
    "the investment paradigm is cast in a probability space @xmath37 augmented with a filtration @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 the set of the associated admissible wealth processes @xmath41 , @xmath42 , starting with @xmath43 and such that @xmath41 is @xmath44-mble .",
    "the term `` admissible ''  is for now generic and will be refined once a specific market model is introduced in the next section .",
    "we call a function @xmath45 a _ utility ( or performance ) function _ if @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and satisfies the inada conditions , @xmath49 and@xmath50 .    for any @xmath51-algebra @xmath52 ,",
    "the set of _ @xmath53-measurable utility ( performance ) functions _ is defined as @xmath54 in other words , the elements of @xmath55 are entirely predicted based on the information contained in @xmath53 .",

    "the market model can be discrete or continuous , and for the latter case , the trading can be discrete or continuous . furthermore ,",
    "if trading is discrete , the rebalancing periods do not need to be aligned with the performance assessment times .    in practice , as mentioned in the introduction , it is typically the case that trading occurs more frequently that performance evaluation , but the above definition accommodates cases when there is perfect alignment - as in the binomial model herein - and the less realistic case when trading lags .",
    "the simplest case of a discrete forward performance process was introduced in @xcite for a binomial model in the context of forward exponential indifference prices . for the special case of time - monotone processes , the solution turned out to be predictable even though the predictability concept per se was not considered therein .",
    "the general definition of forward performance processes was proposed for ito - diffusion markets in @xcite ( see , also @xcite and @xcite , and for variations of the definition , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "definition 1 is therefore a discrete analogue of it with the fundamental element being condition ( i ) , which explicitly requires that the performance function at the _ next _ upcoming assessment time be _ completely determined _ from the information up to the _ present _ time .    as in the continuous - time case ,",
    "properties ( ii)-(iii ) draw from bellman s principle of optimality , which stipulates that the processes @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath71 are respectively a supermartingale and a martingale with respect to the filtration @xmath72 since bellman s principle underlines time consistency , properties ( ii)-(iii ) ensure that the investment problem is time consistent under the predictable forward performance criterion .    we also note that predictability of risk preferences is implicitly present in the classical expected utility in a finite horizon settings , say @xmath73 , $ ] in which a deterministic utility for @xmath74 is pre - chosen at initial time @xmath75 and it is thus @xmath9-mble .",
    "definition [ def : pfu ] leads to a general scheme for constructing predictable forward performance functions . indeed , starting from an initial datum @xmath76 given at time @xmath77 , the entire family @xmath78 can be obtained by determining @xmath79 from @xmath80 iteratively , @xmath81 , as follows .    properties ( ii)(iii ) dictate that , for each trading period @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 .",

    "if we are able to determine , for each @xmath92 a performance function @xmath79 @xmath93 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 satisfying ( [ reversemerton ] ) , then we will have an iterative scheme to construct the _ entire _ predictable forward performance , starting from @xmath62 .",
    "one readily recognizes that ( [ reversemerton ] ) would be the classical expected utility problem if the objective were to derive @xmath96 from @xmath97 with @xmath79 being a deterministic utility function .",
    "therefore , what we consider now is an _",
    "_ investment _ problem in that we are given its initial value function and we seek a terminal utility that is consistent with it , with both these functions being deterministic ( conditionally on @xmath85 ) .    to our knowledge ,",
    "such inverse problems have not been considered before .",
    "we stress that while the forward performance approach is throughout based on inverse problems of similar nature , the existing continuous - time cases do not satisfy requirement ( i ) in definition 1 because @xmath98 is @xmath99-mble .",
    "indeed , this is the case for time - monotone and factor - form performance processes given , respectively , by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are deterministic functions , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 the market price of risk and market factor vector processes ( see , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the only continuous - time predictable case is @xmath106 in log - normal markets , for it is deterministic .",
    "herein , we start a concise study of predictable performance processes with a binomial market model . as we will see , while this is one of the simplest discrete - time market models , its analysis is not trivial .",
