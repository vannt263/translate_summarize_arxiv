    "there exists a generic minimal tree - level diagram , with two external scalars and a heavy intermediate fermion , that can generate naturally suppressed standard model ( sm ) neutrino masses ; see figure  [ fig : nu_tree_generic ] .",
    "the internal fermion line in this diagram has a single mass insertion , which can be of the majorana type or the dirac type .",
    "the minimal ( and best known ) models that produce this diagram are the type - i  @xcite and type - iii  @xcite seesaws , where the sm is augmented by an @xmath0 singlet / triplet fermion with zero hypercharge . in these cases ,",
    "lepton number symmetry is broken by the ( majorana ) mass insertion . however , the underlying mechanism is more general , and alternative extensions of the sm can realize the basic diagram in a number of ways .",
    "the set of these minimal tree - level diagrams can be partitioned according to the nature of the mass insertion ( equivalently , to the origin of lepton number violation ) .",
    "any given representative diagram of the distinct subsets has a number of properties that can be determined without recourse to a specific model .",
    "these properties can , in turn , be used to guide one in the search for viable realizations of these minimal seesaws .    in this work we aim to catalogue the minimal models that produce small neutrino masses via one of these tree - level diagrams . to achieve this goal we reverse - engineer the models . in the process",
    "we  rediscover \" some models that have already appeared in the literature , and discover a number of additional models which , to the best of our knowledge , have not previously appeared .    as one moves beyond the minimal realizations of figure  [ fig : nu_tree_generic ] ,",
    "the models typically require additional fields to be added to the sm .",
    "thus , it naively appears that the tree - level diagram can be realized in a large number of ways .",
    "however , as we will see , if one restricts their attention to natural models , in which no tuning is needed to achieve small vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , the list of candidate models is finite and quite short .",
    "we provide a comprehensive version of this list , apparently exhausting the variant seesaws of this type .",
    "interestingly a number of the corresponding models only realize viable seesaws when the new physics occurs near the tev scale , and are therefore largely amenable to discovery ( or exclusion ) at the lhc .",
    "these models realize neutrino mass by low - energy effective operators with mass dimension @xmath1 .    before proceeding we note that some models described in this paper employ scalars in non - fundamental representations of @xmath0 .",
    "the demands of perturbative unitarity place general upper bounds on the quantum numbers of larger scalar multiplets  @xcite ( also see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , all multiplets appearing here are consistent with these constraints .",
    "bounds from flavor changing processes in models with large multiplets can also be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : mass_insert ] we consider diagrams with a lepton number violating majorana mass insertion .",
    "section  [ sec : l_vertex ] considers diagrams with a dirac mass insertion , for which lepton number symmetry is broken by a vertex .",
    "loop effects are briefly discussed in section  [ sec : loops ] , and we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] . in an appendix we provide details for some non - minimal cases with a majorana mass insertion .",
    "the  busy \" reader is advised that our main results are contained in the two tables presented in the text .",
    "readers interested primarily in the particle content of the models can refer to these tables ; the minimal natural models with a mass insertion of the majorana ( dirac ) type are the first three ( five ) entries in table  [ l_mass_result ] ( table  [ l_vertex_result ] ) .",
    "in the generic tree - level diagram of figure  [ fig : nu_tree_generic ] , the mass insertion can be of the majorana type or the dirac type . adopting the standard convention for a type - i seesaw , in which the beyond - sm fermion @xmath2 is assigned the same lepton number value as the sm leptons ,",
    "these two cases correspond to lepton number violation by the mass insertion , or by a vertex , respectively . in this section",
    "we consider models with a lepton number violating mass insertion , for which the generic tree - level diagram takes the form shown in figure  [ fig : l_massinsert_nu_tree_generic ] .",
    "inspection of the figure reveals the following generic features :    * the internal fermion transforms as @xmath3 under the sm gauge symmetry ; that is , @xmath4 should form a real representation of @xmath5 .",
    "* the multiplet @xmath6 should contain an electrically neutral component , constraining @xmath7 to be an odd number .",
    "* the two external scalars can be distinct .",
    "however , minimal models occur when they have the same quantum numbers : @xmath8 .",
    "* the quantum numbers of the scalars must satisfy the following conditions : y_s =- y_l=1 r_sr_2 .",
    "we focus on the minimal case with @xmath9 here , but comment on the more general case at the end of the section .",
    "the first condition ensures that a lepton - number violating majorana mass appears in the lagrangian , while the last condition ensures that the requisite yukawa couplings appear : & & _ s s_1 l + _ r^c+ , where @xmath10 denotes a sm lepton doublet .",
    "integrating out the heavy fermions , and inserting the scalar vevs , gives the generic form for the seesaw - suppressed sm neutrino masses in these models : m__s^2 .",
    "this mass has the familiar seesaw form , and for good reason ; the simplest models that realize figure  [ fig : l_massinsert_nu_tree_generic ] occur when @xmath11 is the sm scalar . in this case , one can have @xmath12 or @xmath13 , corresponding to the well known type - i  @xcite and type - iii  @xcite seesaw mechanisms , respectively .",
    "these give rise to the famous @xmath14 weinberg operator  @xcite in the low - energy effective theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it should be clear that the basic mechanism for generating seesaw suppressed neutrino masses is more generic than the type - i and type - iii seesaws .",
    "indeed , on the basis of the above - mentioned conditions , it seems that one can select any odd value of @xmath7 , and then choose an appropriate @xmath15 to obtain suppressed neutrino masses via figure  [ fig : l_massinsert_nu_tree_generic ] .",
    "however , there are additional considerations when one moves away from the simplest cases .    in models with @xmath16",
    ", one has @xmath17 and @xmath18 , so @xmath15 forms a non - trivial representation of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , when symmetry breaking occurs , the vev of @xmath15 contributes to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 boson masses .",
    "this modifies the tree - level value of the @xmath21-parameter away from the sm value of @xmath22 , leading to a bound on the vev of roughly @xmath23  gev  @xcite .",
    "direct searches , on the other hand , typically constrain the mass of scalars with non - trivial @xmath0 quantum numbers to satisfy @xmath24  gev .",
    "therefore @xmath15 is expected to be a heavy scalar with a small vev : @xmath25 .",
    "there are two ways in which one can add a heavy scalar to the sm and obtain a small tree - level vev . in the first approach",
    ", one must tune the parameters in the scalar potential , to ensure that multiple dimensionful quantities that are @xmath26  gev conspire to deliver ( @xmath27 .",
    "this approach has limited appeal .    in the second approach ,",
    "the quantum numbers of @xmath15 are such that the scalar potential contains a term that is linear in @xmath15 .",
    "we denote this term as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes generic dimensionful quantities ( field operators or constants ) .",
    "then @xmath15 develops a nonzero vev of the form @xmath30 .",
    "thus , provided @xmath31 , the vev @xmath32 can be naturally suppressed , ensuring that the constraints from the @xmath21-parameter are satisfied without fine tuning . and",
    "the triplet @xmath33 obtains the vev @xmath34 .",
    "we restrict our attention to models possessing a generalized version of this natural vev suppression . ]",
    "the second approach is clearly more desirable .",
    "we therefore restrict our attention to models in which the small vev of any new scalar is naturally suppressed without fine - tuning .",
    "these models achieve a _",
    "natural _ tree - level seesaw via heavy fermion exchange ( with a majorana mass insertion , in the present case ) .    to find candidate models that meet this constraint",
    ", one can consider the direct product of @xmath35 sm scalars , namely @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes a generic sm scalar , including hermitian- or charge - conjugate fields , and the integer @xmath35 satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "a viable model is found if the direct product contains a term @xmath39 for some @xmath38 , provided a scalar field with the quantum numbers @xmath40 contains an electrically neutral component .",
    "this fixes the quantum numbers of the new scalar , @xmath41 , and determines a new model with a natural tree - level seesaw .",
    "the demand of naturalness , in the sense defined above , turns out to be a rather stringent constraint .",
    "a comprehensive study of the aforementioned direct products reveals a single candidate ; namely h^h(1,4,-1 ) , where @xmath42 is the charge conjugate field .",
    "thus , if we add the scalar field @xmath43 to the sm , and also add a real fermion @xmath4 with quantum numbers @xmath44 such that @xmath45 , we obtain a natural tree - level seesaw .",
    "there are two candidates for the new fermion field , namely @xmath13 and @xmath46 .",
    "the former case is non - minimal as the standard type - iii seesaw is also present .",
    "absent hierarchical yukawa couplings of a conspiratorial nature , the type - iii term is expected to dominate the neutrino mass matrix ( we will return to this matter below ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that one can extend the sm by adding the fields s_1~(1,4,1 ) _",
    "r~(1,5,0 ) , to arrive at a new seesaw model that is distinct from the standard type - i and type - iii seesaws .",
    "actually , this model was recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown to provide a viable model of naturally suppressed seesaw neutrino masses .",
    "the lagrangian contains the terms & & _ s s_1 l + _ r^c + h^3 s_1 , where the last term ensures that @xmath15 develops a naturally suppressed vev : , the linear term in @xmath47 forces a naturally suppressed vev of this form . ]",
    "s_1 .[s1_vev_quad ] putting all the pieces together , one arrives at the final expression for the seesaw suppressed neutrino masses : m _ & & _",
    "s^2  ~   , [ eq : quintuplet_nu_mass ] where , for simplicity , we consider dimensionless couplings of @xmath48 in the last expression .",
    "the first expression has the standard seesaw form , @xmath49 , bearing testament to the relation between this model and the more familiar seesaws . denoting @xmath50 as an approximate common scale for the new physics",
    ", the second expression gives @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in this model , the tree - level diagram in figure  [ fig : l_massinsert_nu_tree_generic ] produces an effective low - energy operator is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] with mass - dimension @xmath52 , namely : @xmath53 .",
    "the new fields can therefore be relatively light ; dimensionless couplings of order @xmath54 allow @xmath55 to be as low as @xmath56  gev  @xcite .",
    "the scale of new physics is thus expected to be significantly smaller than that found in the minimal realizations of figure  [ fig : l_massinsert_nu_tree_generic ] , namely the type - i and type - iii seesaws .",
    "the payoff for the extra complexity , it seems , is that interesting regions of parameter space for the resulting model can be explored at the lhc , and there is a realistic chance that the full parameter space of the model can be probed in the  not - too - distant \" future .",
    "this exhausts the list of minimal models that produce natural seesaw neutrino masses via figure  [ fig : l_massinsert_nu_tree_generic ] .",
    "the natural models of this type are the type - i and type - iii seesaws , and the model with a quintuplet fermion introduced in ref .",
    "these models are minimal , in the sense that they comprise minimal extensions of the sm , and that there is only one type of tree - level diagram generating neutrino masses .",
    "there are additional models with a lepton number violating mass insertion that are less minimal .",
    "these models generate diagrams with @xmath57 . in what follows",
    "we briefly discuss an example to illustrate some of the differences .",
    "additional general analysis for these models appears in appendix  [ app : mass_non_minimal ] .",
    "return to the case where the sm is extended to include the scalar @xmath43 .",
    "instead of considering the minimal scenario with @xmath46 , let us now take @xmath13 .",
    "then there are three distinct tree - level diagrams that contribute to light neutrino masses .",
    "the first of these has two external sm scalars , the second has two external scalars @xmath15 , and the third has one external @xmath15 and one external sm scalar .",
    "the light neutrino mass has multiple contributions , which can be written as m_&&_h^2  +   2_h_s  +   _",
    "s^2 .[eq : type_3_variant ] the first piece here is the usual type - iii seesaw term . if all dimensionless couplings are of a similar order of magnitude , this type - iii term is expected to dominate the  pure @xmath15 \" term and the mixing term , due to the relation @xmath58 ; see the appendix . another way to say this ,",
    "is that the three terms in eq .",
    "correspond to low - energy operators with mass dimension @xmath14 , @xmath59 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "given that all three operators arise from tree - level diagrams , one would normally expect the operator with the lowest mass dimension to dominate .",
    "the model is therefore a more complicated version of the type - iii seesaw , with additional subdominant contributions to the neutrino mass matrix .    strictly speaking",
    ", one can imagine that for some reason the coupling @xmath60 is much smaller than the coupling @xmath61 , so the hierarchy in vevs is overcome . in this case the mixing term and the type - iii term can be subdominant to the pure @xmath15 piece , giving @xmath62 , with additional subdominant type - iii ( and mixed ) contributions .",
    "this region of parameter space produces a seesaw that is distinct from the aforementioned minimal variants , and the model can be studied as a viable theory of neutrino masses .",
    "of course , the need for hierarchical yukawa couplings runs counter to the spirit of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "however , the model does have a certain benefit , as the phenomenology of the new scalar can be distinct , and there is a better chance of the new physics being experimentally accessible than in the pure type - iii seesaw  @xcite .",
    ".[l_mass_result ] natural seesaw models with a majorana mass insertion .",
    "the first three entries are minimal while last two entries are not ; model @xmath63 is essentially model @xmath64 with an additional field . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "before concluding , we note that , in addition to the tree - level diagrams in the models we have described , there will also be loop processes that contribute to the light neutrino masses . generally speaking , one expects loop effects to be subdominant to the tree level results . however , one must be careful to account for the details of the given model . in the present class of models",
    ", there always exists a coupling @xmath65 , where @xmath66 can denote the sm scalar .",
    "consequently one expects that the two external scalars ( @xmath66 ) can be joined together to form a one - loop diagram with two external sm scalars ; see figure  [ fig : loop ] .",
    "this one - loop diagram generates an effective operator in the low - energy theory with mass dimension @xmath14 , i.e.  the weinberg operator .",
    "many of the tree - level diagrams presented here produce low - energy operators with mass dimension @xmath1 .",
    "for these models there will be regions of parameter space in which the tree - level diagram is not the dominant effect .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite finds regions of parameter space in which the loop - diagram dominates the tree - diagram for model ( c ) in table  [ l_mass_result ] .",
    "one expects that similar effects are possible in the models presented here when @xmath67\\ge 7 $ ] . in general",
    "both tree - level and loop effects will be present , with the loop - effects dominating for larger values of the beyond - sm masses . if the loop - effect dominates the tree - level mass in a given model , one obtains radiative neutrino masses with sub - dominant tree - level corrections .",
    "our interest is in tree - level seesaw masses and one can crudely estimate the parameter space for which the tree - level diagram is dominant as follows . in a model with @xmath67=d$ ] , the tree - level mass is roughly @xmath68 , while the loop - mass is @xmath69 .",
    "demanding that the former exceeds the latter gives @xmath70 , so that @xmath71  tev for @xmath72 .",
    "the region of parameter space for which the tree - level mass dominates is therefore eminently testable for models with @xmath52 . while tree - level dominance in models with @xmath73 is , at best ,",
    "marginally permitted , and may already be excluded .",
    "certainly the lhc should definitively determine whether the tree - level masses are viable for models ( d ) and ( e ) , and likely for models ( b ) and ( c ) also .",
    "meaningful regions of parameter space will also be probed for model ( a ) .",
    "let us emphasize , however , that this rough estimate should only be used as a guide .",
    "there is a generic minimal tree - level diagram , with two external scalars and a heavy intermediate fermion , that can naturally achieve small neutrino masses via a seesaw .",
    "the diagram has a mass insertion on the internal fermion line , and the set of such diagrams can be partitioned according to whether the mass insertion is of the majorana or dirac type .",
    "we have shown that , upon demanding that requisite small vevs are naturally suppressed , this set is finite , and amenable to a systematic description .",
    "we have undertaken this task , and found a number of original seesaw models in the process .",
    "our results show that there are only three minimal models with a lepton - number symmetry breaking ( majorana ) mass insertion ; namely the type - i and type - iii seesaws , and the quintuplet seesaw of ref .",
    "five additional minimal models also exist , in which the mass insertion is of the dirac type , and lepton number symmetry is broken by a vertex ; these are the @xmath59 model of ref .",
    "@xcite , two models with @xmath52 ( one of which was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and two further models with @xmath73 . our work appears to exhaust the list of these minimal non - tuned tree - level seesaws .    in a partner paper",
    "we shall present similar generalizations of the inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the new @xmath52 model , and a discussion of dark matter candidates in the class of models considered here  @xcite , will appear elsewhere .",
    "the author thanks s.  s.  c.  law .",
    "this work was supported by the australian research council .",
    "models that generate neutrino mass by the seesaw diagram in figure  [ fig : l_massinsert_nu_tree_generic ] with @xmath57 also generate diagrams with two external @xmath15 vevs and two external @xmath74 vevs .",
    "these models are therefore non - minimal , in the sense that there are distinct tree - level diagrams contributing to the neutrino masses .",
    "one can always remove one of the scalars from the model and yet retain a viable theory of seesaw neutrino masses .    in these models",
    "the intermediate fermion must be real , @xmath44 , with odd @xmath75 .",
    "the quantum numbers of the scalars are fixed as @xmath76 .",
    "thus , to ensure that @xmath77 , only models with @xmath78 can have two scalars with distinct quantum numbers . for these models",
    "one always has @xmath79 and @xmath80 , so the term @xmath81 is always allowed .",
    "provided one of the scalars obtains a naturally suppressed vev via its couplings with the sm scalar @xmath37 in @xmath82 , the other scalar @xmath83 can acquire a naturally suppressed vev via this quartic coupling .    for the case of @xmath84 one has the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , while for @xmath85 one has @xmath86 , and @xmath15 has suitable quantum numbers to allow @xmath87 . both @xmath88 and @xmath74 therefore",
    "develop naturally suppressed vevs .",
    "for @xmath89 no coupling linear in @xmath90 can appear in @xmath91 , so one can not be assured of generating naturally suppressed vevs for the beyond - sm scalars [ which form larger representations of @xmath0 ] .",
    "the list of natural non - minimal models of this type is therefore exhausted by the last two entries in table  [ l_mass_result ] .",
