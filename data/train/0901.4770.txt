    "specifically , @xmath176 , @xmath165 , and @xmath177 between @xmath178 and @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 outside this region .",
    "the simulation is performed in a domain of size @xmath182 with periodic boundary conditions in both the @xmath3 and @xmath61 directions . here",
    "the @xmath39 trough serves as the reflecting walls and the trough thickness of @xmath175 is comparable to the reconnection nozzle thickness .",
    "two distant weibel - units are not able to communicate with each other , and therefore it is not surprising to see that the magnetic fields at @xmath183 and @xmath184 in fig .",
    "[ kx_evolve](a ) have opposite signs . as time evolves , the weibel - generated field gets stronger while the long weibel - unit ( @xmath185 at fig .",
    "[ kx_evolve](b ) ) breaks up into smaller weibel units of opposite polarity at ( c ) .",

    "[ weibel_schematic](b ) .",
    "the converging motions of those trajectories at the trough center between @xmath189 and @xmath190 of fig .  [ kx_evolve](d ) contribute to the current for the out - of - plane magnetic field .",
    "these particles reflect from @xmath39 in between @xmath191 , where they deposit their momenta . at late time",
    ", @xmath192 , the entire channel relaxes to a chain of weibel units of alternating polarity , whose length scale is approximately determined by @xmath173 with @xmath193 .    in order to apply this idea to the downstream regions in reconnection simulations , we approximate the characteristic streaming velocity as @xmath194 and the averaged out - of - plane magnetic field as @xmath195 .",
    "this implies a gyro - radius of @xmath175 .",
    "the layer thickness @xmath172 is @xmath196 along the reconnection nozzle , and thus @xmath169 has a scale of approximately @xmath197 , about half of the size of the observed structure in fig .",
    "[ weibel_2stream](c ) .",
    "this mechanism roughly explains the scale size of the observed variation .",
    "furthermore , the gyromotion of the reconnection outflow helps explain how the reconnection nozzle broadens downstream .",
    "the out - of - plane magnetic field bends the outflow momentum from the @xmath3 to the @xmath61-direction . as a result",
    "this flow pushes the background harris magnetic field away from the symmetry line , broadening the current layer .",
    "we have developed a four - beam model to study the effects on the weibel instability of a spatial inhomogeneity arising from a current layer .",
    "we have shown that the weibel instability is able to grow within narrow harris sheets , and its growth rate ( saturation time ) , saturation magnitude , and mode structure fit those values observed in pair reconnection .",
    "this further suggests that the weibel instability might control the current layer dynamics in pair reconnection , where the hall term is absent .",
    "other candidate instabilities , such as the two - stream and firehose instabilities have rather minor effects , particularly since it is not clear if the firehose instability even appears in these systems .",
    "the high - velocity outflow scatters into the transverse direction due to the lorentz force arising from the weibel - generated out - of - plane magnetic field .",
    "we argue that the associated increased pressure @xmath198 is responsible for opening the pair reconnection nozzle and shortening the current layer . as a consequence , the shorter current layer generates a higher reconnection rate .",
    "even though a similar temperature anisotropy also could arise in electron - proton reconnection , signatures of the weibel instability are not seen there .",
    "the reason is that the even shorter current layer ( @xmath199 ) , controlled by whistler waves @xcite , leaves insufficient space for the unstable weibel mode to grow .",
    "it is an open question as to how the weibel instability controlled reconnection transforms into whistler mediated reconnection as the electron to ion mass ratio changes .",
    "the development of the weibel instability in the initial state of relativistic ( @xmath200 ) pair reconnection is described in zenitani & hesse @xcite . there",
    "the weibel instability is shown to grow in front of a tangential discontinuity formed by the mixing of outflowing and ambient plasma , but it is not clear if this turbulence plays a role in the steady - state development of the outflow exhaust and the associated current layer . however , by artificially suppressing the weibel - generated out - of - plane magnetic field , they do demonstrate the ability of the weibel mode to broaden the current layer , similar to the behavior of the present non - relativistic case .",
    "the growth rate and wave vector of the relativistic weibel instability are smaller by a factor of @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the lorentz factor @xcite .",
    "consequently , we expect the instability to grow more slowly during relativistic pair reconnection , not only because of the intrinsically lower growth rate but also because of the relatively larger suppressing effect of the harris reversed field on the enlarged mode structure ( if we assume a similar nozzle thickness in both the relativistic and non - relativistic regimes ) .",
    "overall , it remains an open question as to whether the weibel instability plays an important role in controlling relativistic electron - positron reconnection .",
