    "systems with strongly correlated electrons are a subject of considerable research efforts . among those are the ones with 5@xmath0 electrons , i.  e. , involving actinide ions of particular interest .",
    "while 4@xmath0 electrons , because of their closeness to the nuclei , are correlated as strongly as possible on an atom , the 5@xmath0 electrons have a larger spatial extent and tend more towards delocalization .",
    "the degree of delocalization is even more pronounced when 3@xmath1 electrons are considered . by continuing this line of arguments",
    "one finds that @xmath2 electrons are the least correlated ones on an atom and have the largest tendency to delocalize .    returning to 5@xmath0 electrons",
    ", the question arises under which circumstances localized features dominate delocalized ones or vice versa .",
    "in particular we want to follow up the suggestion which has been made previously @xcite that 5@xmath0 electrons have a dual character in the sense that some of the 5@xmath0 orbitals lead to delocalization when occupied by electrons while others result in localization .",
    "it was demonstrated that a division of 5@xmath0 orbitals into delocalized and localized ones is able to explain the heavy quasiparticles observed in upt@xmath3 and upd@xmath4al@xmath3 including their mass anisotropies @xcite .",
    "however , the question remained unanswered as regards the microscopic origin of this division of orbitals .",
    "apparently , strong intra - atomic correlations seem to enhance anisotropies in the kinetic energy matrix elements which reflect anisotropies in the hybridization with the chemical environment .    the purpose of the present work is to clarify the physical origin of the dual character of 5@xmath0 electrons . for that purpose clusters of two and three sites are considered . because of the large spin - orbit coupling each 5@xmath0 electron is characterized by its total angular momentum @xmath5 and azimuthal quantum number @xmath6 .",
    "we do not include @xmath7 states in our analysis since their energy is higher by approximately 1ev @xcite .",
    "we shall treat clusters where the average number of 5@xmath0 electrons per site is either 2.5 or 2.67 , values which are close to the 5@xmath0 occupancy of u ions in compounds like upt@xmath3 @xcite , upd@xmath4al@xmath3 or uge@xmath4 @xcite .    depending on @xmath6",
    "different hopping matrix elements are assumed for the @xmath0 electrons in the cluster .",
    "the key result of the present investigation is to demonstrate that indeed anisotropies in the hopping are strongly enhanced by intra - atomic correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after defining the model",
    "hamiltonian a two - site and a three - site cluster are investigated .",
    "various properties are calculated , like the ground - state energy and magnetization as well as the density of states and its magnetic field dependence .",
    "this is done for different ratios , of hopping .",
    "partial localization is the subject of the subsequent section [ secpartial ] . a discussion and",
    "the conclusions are found in sect .",
    "the appendices are devoted to perturbation theory , the atomic limit of vanishing inter - atomic electron transfer and to a more detailed analysis of the ground state s composition .",
    "we investigate a microscopic model of 5@xmath0 electrons which includes local coulomb interactions and hopping terms between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the model hamiltonian is @xmath8 where the first sum is over neighboring sites @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath12 in the @xmath13 state with @xmath14 .",
    "we will consider two and three sites models .",
    "the effective hopping between sites results from the hybridization of the 5@xmath0 states with the orbitals of the ligands and depends generally on the crystal structure . rather than trying to exhaust all possible different lattice symmetries",
    ", we shall concentrate here on the special case that hopping conserves @xmath6 . while this is certainly an idealization",
    ", it allows us to concentrate on our main interest , i.  e. , a study of the influence of atomic correlations on the renormalization of hybridization matrix elements .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 are chosen in accordance with density - functional calculations for bulk material which use @xmath16 basis states .",
    "we also include local magnetic fields @xmath17 to account for the influence of ferromagnetic ( fm ) or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) internal fields .",
    "the local coulomb interactions can be written in the form @xmath18 with coulomb matrix elements @xmath19 here @xmath20 denotes the total angular momentum of two electrons and @xmath21 .",
    "the sum is restricted by the antisymmetry of the clebsch - gordan coefficients @xmath22 to even values @xmath23 .",
    "we use in the actual calculations @xmath24 values which are determined from lda wavefunctions for upt@xmath25@xcite , i.  e. ,  @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "we expect @xmath29 to always hold for coulomb interactions , independently of the chemical environment .",
    "in contrast , the relative order of the hopping matrix elements will vary strongly from one compound to the next .",
    "the average coulomb repulsion of about 20ev is irrelevant for the low - energy physics of the model .",
    "it simply restricts the relevant configurations to states so that the sites are occupied either by 2 or 3 electrons .",
    "the low - energy sector is solely determined by the differences of the @xmath30 values , which are of the order of 1ev and thus slightly larger than typical bare @xmath0  bandwidths .",
    "the latter are obtained , e.g. , from lda calculations for metallic uranium compounds like upt@xmath3 .",
    "note that restricting the model to @xmath31 and @xmath32 configurations is equivalent to let the different @xmath33 while their differences remain finite .",
    "to mimic the situation in the u - based heavy - fermion compounds we consider the intermediate valence regime .",
    "note that in the absence of a magnetic field all states of the two - site model with 5 electrons will be at least doubly degenerate because of kramers degeneracy .",
    "the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : twositehamiltonian ] ) conserves @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the z - component of the total angular momentum of the system and the @xmath36 refer to angular momentum projections on individual sites .",
    "we shall therefore characterize the eigenstates by their @xmath35 value . for isotropic hopping @xmath37",
    "the system is rotationally invariant .",
    "then @xmath38 provides an additional good quantum number .",
    "as mentioned before it should suffice to limit ourselves to the subspace of @xmath31 and @xmath32 configurations , because of the large values of @xmath30 . to assess the validity of this simplification we shall compare the predicted ground states for the @xmath31-@xmath32 restricted model with those obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : twositehamiltonian ] ) in the full space .",
    "the rational for the restriction to @xmath31-@xmath32 is not the reduction of the numerical diagonalization effort by a factor of about two , but the conceptual simplicity gained for the interpretation and presentation of the results for , e.g. , local spin configurations and orbital occupations . in the full model , interactions of the order of @xmath39 are present which arise from virtual @xmath40-@xmath41-@xmath42 transitions ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 are representative values of @xmath45 and @xmath30 , respectively . )",
    "the restricted model ceases to be a good approximation when these interactions become comparable to the bare parameters of the model .    for most of the calculations below",
    "we shall assume @xmath46 and @xmath47 as independent parameters , a choice motivated by lda calculations for upt@xmath3 @xcite where @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "however , partial localization , which we will discuss in section [ secpartial ] , is also found for other parameter choices , e.  g. , by choosing @xmath50 and @xmath51 as independent parameters .",

    "this is indeed the case : the first excited state has again @xmath186 but with a fourfold rather than twofold degeneracy .",
    "the excited states can be very well approximated by a difference of any two of the three states @xmath183 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , e.  g. @xmath187 .",
    "for fixed @xmath147 or @xmath188 these states span a subspace of dimension two .",
    "we may view the first excited state as an excitation of the frustrated afm background which is dominated by the @xmath166,@xmath189 orbitals , while the electrons / holes in the @xmath170 orbitals simply adjust to the slow dynamical changes of the magnetic background .",
    "the magnetic correlations of the ground state are also interesting .",
    "the overall magnetic correlations in @xmath190 are weakly ferromagnetic , i.  e. , @xmath191 .",
    "but because of @xmath192 one can construct states @xmath193 which have no magnetic correlations .",
    "thus , we have a situation with a localization mechanism akin to a mott transition , but without the magnetic correlations which are usually present in mott systems .",
    "in this investigation we have studied the effects of strong intra - atomic correlations on anisotropies in the hybridization of different 5@xmath0 orbitals with the environment . for that purpose we considered two - site and three - site clusters which allow for a complete numerical diagonalization of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "we demonstrated that in particular hund s rule correlations enhanced strongly anisotropies in the hybridizations . for",
    "a certain range of parameters this may result in a complete suppression of the effective hybridization except for the largest one , which remains almost unaffected .",
    "this provides for a microscopic picture of partial localization of 5@xmath0 electrons , a phenomena , observed in a number of experiments on u compounds . in fact , previous work on the de haas - van alphen frequencies and anisotropic effective masses in upt@xmath3 and upt@xmath4al@xmath3 could explain the experimental data very well by assuming , that two of the 5@xmath0 electrons of the u ions remain localized while a third one is itinerant @xcite .",
    "the latter is in an orbital with @xmath91 in both cases , and a @xmath194-@xmath194 coupling scheme is used .",
    "previous work on the molecule uranocene u(c@xmath195h@xmath195)@xmath4 gave a hint on partial localization @xcite , but the present work provides a detailed justification for such a feature . by including an external field we obtained a rich magnetic phase diagram .",
    "we plan to investigate its relevance to compound such as uge@xmath4 .",
    "we note that intra - atomic excitations within the system of two localized 5@xmath0 electrons might provide the required bosonic excitations for itinerant electron attraction and cooper - pair formation @xcite .",
    "one may also speculate about the application of the present findings to multiband hubbard models .",
    "they are used to describe correlations in transition metal compounds @xcite .",
    "this problem is left for a future investigation as well as the one of a u impurity embedded in a weakly correlated chemical environment .",
    "also a molecular - field description of the effects found here , e.g. , by introducing auxiliary fields to model the correlation effects is an interesting subject of future research . in an extended version of this paper we plan to discuss also the phenomenon of charge disproportionation , which may occur in clusters of the type investigated here",
    "in the limit @xmath196 , the 180 states of products of local @xmath31 configurations @xmath197 and local @xmath32 configurations @xmath198 are degenerate .",
    "the corresponding states are direct products of maximal local @xmath115 states , i.e. , three - particle states with @xmath199 and two - particle states with @xmath200 .",
    "finite hopping splits the manifold in first order degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "the transition matrix element for hopping with initial product state @xmath201 @xmath202 and final state @xmath203 @xmath204 is @xmath205    where the @xmath206 are clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "in the plane spanned by @xmath53 and @xmath84 , for small @xmath45 transitions occur near @xmath207 and at the isotropic line , see fig .",
    "[ f2f3_phasentt2.eps ] .",
    "these transitions are reproduced with the perturbative treatment .",
    "furthermore , the perturbative analysis also describes the degeneracies of the ground states correctly .    of particular interest",
    "is the behavior along the isotropic line @xmath208 where the lifting of degeneracy can be solved in closed form . in this limit @xmath85@xmath209 provides an additional good quantum number .",
    "we therefore consider basis states which are eigenstates of @xmath210@xmath209 , i.e. , @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "they are obtained as linear combinations of the above - mentioned product states @xmath213 and @xmath214 . in this basis , the hopping matrix elements depend only upon @xmath85 and can be expressed in terms of the 6-@xmath194 symbols    @xmath215    where @xmath216 4 & { \\cal j } & \\frac{9}{2 } \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ]    accounts for the variation with @xmath85 of the hopping matrix element .",
    "this result allows for a simple interpretation . in the @xmath217 model ,",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath85 of the 5-electron states @xmath218 and @xmath219 arises from the coupling of three angular momenta .",
    "they characterize @xmath31 configurations at the two sites @xmath69 and @xmath70 with angular momenta 4 and an additional electron which can sit at either site .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath220 of this electron couples with that of the corresponding @xmath31-configurations yielding the angular momentum @xmath221 or @xmath222 of the @xmath32-configurations at site @xmath69 or @xmath70 , respectively . technically speaking , the states @xmath223 and @xmath224 arise from applying different coupling schemes to the three above - mentional angular momenta . hopping between the two sites connects the two types of states . as a consequence , the hopping matrix elements can be expressed in terms of the 6@xmath194-symbols which transform between the two different coupling schemes .",
    "the variation with @xmath85 of the hopping matrix elements is easily evaluated yielding    @xmath225    here @xmath85 is restricted to half - integer values @xmath226 .",
    "the variation with @xmath85 of @xmath227 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:6j ] .",
    "the maximum value for @xmath228 is obtained for @xmath229 corresponding to a sixfold degenerate ground state in the isotropic case .",
    "with @xmath85 in the isotropic case.[fig:6j ] ]",
    "at the phase boundaries in fig .",
    "[ f2f3_phasentt2.eps ] the jumps of the @xmath230 component of the total magnetization of a two - site cluster coincide with changes of the orbital - resolved occupation number @xmath231 in the ground - state wavefunction .",
    "there are shown as gray - scale plots in fig .",
    "[ figwwtt ] .",
    "they confirm the scenario developed in the body of the text and allow for some additional observations .",
    "the figure corresponds to the @xmath232 phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ f2f3_phasentt2.eps ] in an infinitesimal ferromagnetic field . for weak",
    "hopping with @xmath233 , the @xmath132 and the @xmath159 orbitals are fully occupied on both sites , whereas @xmath234 is half - occupied , allowing for a maximal kinetic energy gain .",
    "the corresponding total angular momentum component @xmath235 .",
    "similarly for large @xmath53 values the @xmath64 phase is formed in which one of the @xmath159 electrons is promoted to @xmath97 .    in all other phases ,",
    "the average occupations of all orbitals are close to one half or zero .",
    "occupations near one half could indicate frequent hopping .",
    "such a paramagnetic interpretation is appropriate only if @xmath236 is much larger than the energy differences @xmath237 resulting in hund s rule .",
    "the three phases to be discussed are best classified by looking at the particular @xmath6 orbital which remains unoccupied ( light - colored areas in the figure ) . obviously , for the case @xmath238 , the loss of hopping energy gain is minimal if @xmath97 remains empty , yielding @xmath239 . in the case",
    "@xmath240 , either the orbital @xmath241 or @xmath242 is unoccupied , leading to @xmath243 and @xmath244 , respectively . it should be kept in mind that the coulomb interaction mixes various @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "the concept of occupying @xmath6 states is therefore only approximate .",
