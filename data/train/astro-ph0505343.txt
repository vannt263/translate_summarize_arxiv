    "the local group consists of three spiral galaxies and a large number of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath190% of its 40 known members ) .",
    "this proportion of galaxy types may be typical of the local universe as similar distributions are known to exist in nearby groups @xcite and clusters @xcite .",
    "the dwarf galaxies ( irregular , spheroidal or elliptical ) of the lg are of particular interest as their proximity allows us to study them in detail , testing predictions concerning their formation and evolution , as , for instance , the evolution of different kind of dwarfs @xcite or their star formation histories @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their study is relevant because , according to the hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation , dwarf galaxies are the first structures to form and from their merging larger galaxies are built @xcite .",
    "moreover , low - luminosity dwarf galaxies , as those discussed in this paper , are metal poor and are expected to have abundances close to primordial values @xcite . thus the abundances derived there can be useful in extrapolating primordial he / h ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the overall star formation history ( sfh ) of the universe predicted by @xcite with the sfhs of galaxies of different morphological type that exist in the lg ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is fundamental in order to understand the variation of sfh from the global average in galaxies of differing morphological type ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a quantitative sfh can be obtained with the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) technique ( cf .",
    "this technique involves three main ingredients : i ) the data , from which a deep observational cmd can be plotted ; ii ) stellar evolution and a bolometric correction libraries providing colors and magnitudes of stars as a function of age , mass , and metallicity ; and iii ) a method to relate the number of stars populating different regions of the observational cmd with the density distribution of stars as a function of age , mass , and metallicity , as predicted by stellar evolution theory ( see @xcite for a complete review ) .",
    "this method can , in principle , constrain the entire star formation and chemical history of a galaxy , but , of course , it depends on the precision of the input models and on the assumptions @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the overall results of this method are model dependent , complementary specific evolutionary phases can be used as _ age - tracers _ to mark different populations and to infer the presence of a given age component @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present new results from the latest study of individual group members as part of the continuing lg census .",
    "this census is a narrow- and broad - band imaging survey of the galaxies of the lg , visible from the isaac newton group of telescopes ( ing ) , whose aim is to find , catalogue and study old and young emission - line populations , such as planetary nebulae , supernova remnants and  regions @xcite .",
    "we are interested in identifying planetary nebulae , which are good indicators of the presence of intermediate - age stars .",
    "lgc observations were obtained with the wide field camera ( wfc ) at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) .",
    "the detector of the wfc is a mosaic composed of four ccds , with 2048@xmath24096 pixels each .",
    "it covers a field of view of @xmath3 .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.@xmath433.rcorradi/lgc for the description of the project ]    the results obtained until now in the search for pne in the lg galaxies are described in the following papers : @xcite , @xcite , hereafter m03 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .    here we describe the results of the observations of the next three targets : the dwarf irregular galaxies ic  1613 ( morphological type ir  v according to @xcite , hereafter vdb00 ) , ( ir  iv - v ; @xcite ) , and 8  ( dirr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the gas - rich dwarf irregular galaxy ic  1613 was first discovered by @xcite and because of its proximity ( 730 kpc , @xcite ) , its high galactic latitude ( -60.6 ) and consequently small galactic extinction , has provided an excellent opportunity to observe stellar populations in a low metallicity environment . in fact , its oxygen abundance as derived from regions is approximately 12 + log ( o / h)=7.7 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , ic  1613 is a relatively isolated non - interacting irregular galaxy , as proven by the lack of stellar clusters generated by interactions with other galaxies @xcite . from an evolutionary point of view , it is a very primitive galaxy because the stellar mass is comparable to the gas mass @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented b , v , r and i stellar photometry pointing out the presence of stars in a wide range of ages , from young to intermediate and old population .",
    "recent hubble space telescope observations by @xcite found an enhanced star formation rate ( sfr ) from 3 to 6 gry ago .",
    "a survey for emission - line objects was done in this galaxy by @xcite who found one candidate pn .    the wolf - lundmark - melotte ( ) galaxy was discovered by @xcite and independently by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "( called also ddo  221 , @xcite ) is a local group metal - poor dwarf irregular ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.7 ; @xcite ) , in a part of the local group relatively free of galaxies , at a distance of 925  kpc ( vdb00 ) .",
    "@xcite studied with the hubble space telescope the sfh in a portion of wlm .",
    "it appears to have begun no more than 12 gyr ago , forming more than half of its stellar population by 9 gyr ago .",
    "the sfr has subsequently gradually decreased until a recent increase in activity starting between 1 and 2.5 gyr ago , but is still continuing to the present time .",
    "recent star formation is indicated by several  regions around o - type stars , as observed by @xcite .    to date no candidate pn",
    "is known in this galaxy .",
    "in fact @xcite found the two candidate pne proposed by @xcite to be ordinary stars .",
    "the other candidate pn identified by minniti & zijlstra ( 1996;1997 ) was found to be a compact  region ( zijlstra , private communication ) .",
    "8 was first discovered by @xcite and it was catalogued as ddo 155 by @xcite .",
    "it is a suspected member of the local group ( vdb00 ) , but observations of a single cepheid by @xcite and of the tip of the rgb by @xcite placed this galaxy at the distance of 2.2  mpc , beyond the usually accepted limit of the lg .",
    "8  is one of the intrinsically smallest irregular galaxies known , with an effective radius of only 50  pc and  mass of 10@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "several  regions are known in this galaxy @xcite .",
    "their abundances have been measured by @xcite , finding one of the lowest known oxygen abundances ( 12 + log ( o / h)=7.4 ) .",
    "no pn have been identified in 8@xcite .",
    "basic data on the three galaxies are reported in table  [ tab_gal ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,<,<,<,<,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab_pos ]",
    "given the mass range covered by pn progenitors , assumed to be classicaly between 0.8m@xmath6 ( or a bit higher , 1  m@xmath6 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) and 8m@xmath6 , the stellar population from which pne derive is formed at intermediate ages ( roughly 1 to 8 gyr ago ) during the history of a galaxy .",
    "one can evaluate the total mass of such a stellar population using the theoretical relation between the total luminosity of the population of pne progenitors and the pne number , obtained under the hypothesis of coeval , chemically homogeneous stars @xcite .",
    "the total luminosity of the population of pne progenitors , @xmath7 , is related to the number of pne , @xmath8 , to their lifetime , @xmath9 , and to the so - called evolutionary flux , @xmath10 . the number of stars with initial mass @xmath11 per unit luminosity leaving the main sequence each year is then given by the expression @xmath12 thus , counting planetary nebulae and estimating the mean mass of the pne progenitors we have a measure of the total mass of the intermediate - age stellar population , or at least a lower limit to it , when the pne survey is not complete . using a lifetime of @xmath110  000  yrs for the pn phase , a mean specific evolutionary flux of 2@xmath13  yr@xmath14  @xmath15 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , a mean progenitor mass of @xmath11.5  m@xmath16 ( computed using the initial mass function by @xcite , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath15@xmath17 ) , the lower limit to the intermediate - age stellar mass in the lg galaxies can be estimated .",
    "the intermediate - age stellar mass is proportional to the number of pne , and with the approximations described above , we found that about 2@xmath210@xmath18  m@xmath6 were formed for each pn observed .",
    "we used all the _ candidate _ pne discovered in the local group by several authors ( see references below ) with the on - band / off - band or similar techniques , and the criteria described in sect .  4 , considered as _ bona fide _",
    "pne for the following reasons .",
    "the first is that these criteria give a good confidence on the pn nature of the candidate .",
    "for instance , a follow - up spectroscopic study of pn candidates detected in m  33 by @xcite confirmed more than 70% as pne @xcite , even if the criterion of r@xmath191.6 was not used . among the remaining 30% objects",
    ", some indetermination remains between low - excitation pne and compact  regions , which have similar spectroscopic and photometric features .",
    "the second reason is that it is impossible to study the statistical properties of pn population in the lg if considering only spectroscopically confirmed pne since spectroscopic observations have been obtained for only @xmath110% of the total number of lg pne .",
    "in addition , once obtained , spectroscopy can not provide complete confidence in the determination of the nature of the object , in many cases because of the faintness of the objects @xcite . in figure  [ fig - inter ]",
    ", we show the result , plotting the total stellar mass of the galaxies ( values from vdb00 ) vs. the observed number of pne ( left vertical axis ) .",
    "the latter is proportional to the the mass of the intermediate - age stellar population ( right vertical axis ) with a constant of proportionality of 2@xmath210@xmath18 .",
    "errors amount to @xmath130% in the estimate of the total stellar mass of galaxies , and to @xmath150% in the estimate of the intermediate - age mass for the galaxies where we obtained the number of pne within 4  mag from the cutoff of the pnlf ( upper panel ) . for the galaxies where we have only the number of observed pne ( lower panel ) ,",
    "only a lower limit to the intermediate - age mass can be given .",
    "the references on the number of pne in the local group and also on their spectroscopic confirmation , if any , are : m  31 2764 pne identified with the planetary nebulae spectrograph by @xcite , @xmath130 confirmed with spectroscopy by @xcite , @xcite ; mw @xmath12400 ( 1143 + 242 true and probable pne in @xcite , and @xmath11000 in @xcite ) ; m  33 152 pne identified by @xcite ( @xmath130 confirmed by @xcite ) ; lmc @xmath11000 estimated , 350 discovered by @xcite and 700 newly discovered by @xcite ( @xmath1 200 confirmed by @xcite ) ; smc 132 estimated and 101 discovered @xcite ( @xmath1 70 confirmed by @xcite ) ; m32 30 @xcite ( 14 confirmed by @xcite ) ; ngc  205 35 @xcite ( 13 confirmed by @xcite ) ; ic  10 16 @xcite ; ngc  6822 17 @xcite ( 6 confirmed , leisy , private communication ) ; ngc  185 5 @xcite ( 5 confirmed by @xcite ) ; ngc  147 9 @xcite ; sagittarius 3 @xcite ( confirmed ) ; fornax 1 @xcite ( confirmed ) ; pegasus 1 @xcite ; leo  a 1 @xcite ( confirmed , leisy , private communication ) ; ngc  3109 18 @xcite ; sextans  b 5 @xcite ( confirmed by @xcite ) ; sextans  a 1 @xcite ( confirmed by @xcite ) .    despite the large errors , a linear trend can be traced ( the continuous line in the upper panel of figure  [ fig - inter ] ) , where the total stellar mass of the galaxies is plotted versus the number of pne , for all cases in which we could estimate their population size corrected to a completeness limit of 4 magnitudes below the pnlf cutoff .",
    "this number is extrapolated from the empirical formula of the luminosity function @xcite for the lg galaxies where the completeness limit in the search for pne was known , and where pne above this limit were discovered . from this plot",
    "we can infer which galaxies had relatively strong star formation during the past @xmath118  gyrs , i.e. in the period corresponding to the formation of the pne progenitors .",
    "in particular , we can compare the location of dwarf galaxies in figure  [ fig - inter ] with their sfhs reviewed by @xcite .",
    "we find that the galaxies which show little star formation during the past 18  gyrs , i.e. the galaxies with a relative star - formation rate @xmath200.2 during that peroid of time ( cf .",
    "figure  8 of @xcite ) , generally lie in the diagram below the continuous line ( filled squares ) . on the contrary ,",
    "those with strong intermediate - age star formation , namely sfr@xmath210.2 , are located above the least squares fit line ( filled circles).we note that galaxies which had a conspicuous star formation during the past @xmath118  gyrs lie above the continuous line , with the only exception being ngc  6822 .",
    "it has a smaller number of pne than expected for its mass",
    ". it might be due to the determination of its stellar mass which is particularly difficult because of the large extent of its halo @xcite .",
    "another aspect which might be suggested from figure  [ fig - inter ] is that all systems associated with m  31 ( m  32 , ngc  205 , ngc  147 , ic  10 , with exception of ngc  185 ) and with the mw ( smc , lmc ) have enhanced recent star formation , while several isolated systems have lower rates ( sextans  a , sextans  b , leo  a , ngc  6822 ) , suggesting that star formation might be enhanced by interaction with the giant galaxies .    in the lower panel , the total stellar mass of the galaxies is plotted versus the observed number of candidate pne . again",
    "a linear trend can be traced , but we note that only a lower limit to the intermediate - age mass can be estimated from this plot because the number of pne might be not complete .",
    "the location in this diagram of ic  1613 and wlm , is in agreement with what we know about their star formation histories , showing a higher star formation during intermediate ages in ic  1613 than in wlm .",
    "pne are therefore confirmed to be useful evolutionary age tracers of the intermediate - age population .",
    "the presence of pne is enough evidence for an intermediate - age population @xcite , and , in addition , the relationship of their number to the host galaxy mass gives information on the relative star formation history between different galaxies , where the same completeness in the search of pne has been reached .",
    "these results agree with the those obtained by accurate sfh analysis @xcite .",
    "in this paper we presented the search for pne in three dwarf irregular galaxies belonging to the local group , or close to it : ic  1613 , wlm , and 8 .",
    "we discovered two new candidate pne in ic  1613 , one in wlm , and none in 8 .",
    "their number and their absolute magnitude were analyzed as a function of the sfh of the hosting galaxies .",
    "the number of pne of these galaxies together with the number of pne in the other lg galaxies are used to estimate the mass of intermediate - age population of each galaxy .",
    "this is compared with the sfr of the lg dwarf galaxies from 1 to 8  gry ago , finding that the number of pne agrees with the results obtained by accurate sfh analysis and can therefore be used to constrain synthetic models of sfhs .",
    "we are very grateful to the anonymous referee whose comments resulted in a significant improvement of the work reported in this paper .",
    "the int data have been made publically available through the local group census programme ( pi : n. a. walton ) of the isaac newton group s wide field camera survey programme .",

    "<S> in the framework of the local group census ( lgc ) , a survey of the local group ( lg ) galaxies above dec=@xmath0 , which is aimed at surveying their populations with strong emission lines , we have searched for planetary nebulae ( pne ) in the low - metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies ic  1613 , , 8 . </S>",
    "<S> two new candidate pne have been found in ic  1613 , one in wlm and none in 8 . </S>",
    "<S> the observations presented in this paper , together with the previous results from the lgc , represent the first step in the study of the pn population in low - metallicity , dwarf irregular galaxies of the local group . </S>",
    "<S> they will be followed by deep spectroscopy to confirm their nature and to study their physical - chemical properties . </S>",
    "<S> we used the observed number of pne in each lg galaxy to estimate a lower limit to the mass of the intermediate - age population which was compared to the star formation rate ( sfr ) of lg dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in agreement with those from accurate star formation history ( sfh ) analysis for these small galaxy systems .    </S>",
