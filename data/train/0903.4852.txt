    "when we treat the eigenfunction problem of the closure of an @xmath0-th order differential operator on a hilbert space with a certain boundary condition , we should be careful to distinguish this problem from the problem of finding solutions in the space of @xmath0-times differentiable functions @xmath10 of the differential equation described by this differential operator definable only in @xmath10 .",
    "if a solution to the latter problem belongs to the hilbert space above and satisfies the boundary condition , it is always an eigenfunction of the former problem from the definition .",
    "however , it is not necessarily the case that eigenfunctions of the former problem belong to @xmath10 . hence , the regularity ( continuity and differentiability up to @xmath0 times ) of the eigenfunctions of the former problem should be examined carefully .    in the theory of elliptic operators",
    "@xcite , this problem has been discussed under assumptions for the sobolev space , i.e. , the assumption that the @xmath4-th order derivatives of the eigenfunction with @xmath5 belong to @xmath11-space .",
    "these assumptions are often required for the validity of numerical methods that solve differential equations by projection to finite dimensional subspaces ( ritz - galerkin and petrov - galerkin methods  @xcite  @xcite , for example ) .    on the other hand , in this paper , for a class of hilbert spaces containing @xmath7",
    ", we will discuss the regularity problem above under several conditions , without any assumptions concerning the @xmath4-th order derivatives of the eigenfunction .",
    "the condition in our discussion is that the differential operator has rational coefficient functions and its characteristic equation ( eigenvalue equation ) has no singular point . under this condition",
    ", we prove that the regularity above is always guaranteed .",
    "this discussion can be generalized , even for a differential operator ( with rational coefficient functions ) whose characteristic equation has singular points , by excluding only the regularity at the singular points of the characteristic equation . especially for fuchsian - type differential operators ,",
    "we give a stronger statement than general cases .",
    "the proof is based on a one - to - one correspondence between the ` regular ' solutions in the hilbert space of the differential equation and the square - summable number - sequence solutions of simultaneous linear equations described by a kind of matrix representation of the action of the differential operator , which is guaranteed under several conditions . in this paper",
    ", we will clarify how we can show regularity using this one - to - one correspondence .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows : section [ sec : pp ] introduces the basic framework used for the proof .",
    "firstly , in subsection [ subsec : s21 ] we clarify precisely what has to be proved .",
    "next , subsection [ subsec : s22 ] provides a more general framework in which the regularity problem can be discussed , and it shows the conditions that are required for the base of this framework .",

    ", we have to define the differential operator in a complete function space .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the function space @xmath14 , which is defined by @xmath15 with inner product @xmath16 and norm @xmath17 , parametrized by @xmath3 . here , in the special case of @xmath6 , @xmath18 is identical to the usual @xmath7",
    ". then , the operator @xmath19 is defined by the action of @xmath20 with domain @xmath21 and its closure @xmath22 with respect to the graph norm  @xcite .",
    "in general , an eigenfunction of the closed extension of the given differential operator does not necessarily yield a solution of the ode @xmath13 .",
    "this is because there is a possibility that the eigenfunction is not an @xmath0-times differentiable function .",
    "this problem is called the regularity problem for a differential operator .    in the present paper , we prove that the eigenfunction of the operator @xmath22 always does yield a solution of the ode @xmath13 . since this problem depends on the singularity of the differential equation ,",
    "we need the following definition .",
    "a real number @xmath23 is called a singular point of a differential operator @xmath20 if @xmath24 is a singular point of the differential equation @xmath25 for some real number @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , the above definition does not depend on @xmath26 .",
    "when the coefficient functions of @xmath27 are polynomial , the set of its singular points equals the set of zero points of its coefficient function @xmath28 of the highest degree , which is written as @xmath29 . when the coefficient functions @xmath30 @xmath31 of @xmath20 are rational functions , we denote the least common multiple of the denominators of @xmath30 by @xmath32",

    "@xmath20 are rational functions , then any eigenfunction of @xmath36 belongs to @xmath41 for any integer @xmath42 .    in the next subsection",
    ", we will give a more general argument , which includes theorem [ thm : main ] as a special case .",
    "in this subsection , we treat the regularity problem in a general hilbert space @xmath43 of functions on the real line @xmath44 .",
    "that is , we give three conditions equivalent to the solution of the ode @xmath45 in a general hilbert function space @xmath43 , where we convert the ode to square - summable solutions of a matrix - vector equation ( simultaneous linear equations ) defined in the following general framework .",
