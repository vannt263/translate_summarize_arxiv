    "in early type stars the ultraviolet spectral region is important for several reasons .",
    "firstly , since the majority of the total flux is emitted here , it provides a rather sensitive indicator of a photospheric temperature and luminosity .",
    "secondly , the uv spectra are dominated by lines of the iron - group elements , which cause the origin of the opacity bump at temperature @xmath4  k , where the classical @xmath5 mechanism drives pulsations of @xmath3 cep stars . consequently , the position of the instability domain in the hr diagram strongly depends on the metal abundance ( pamyatnykh 1999 ) .",
    "we derive stellar parameters ( metallicity , [ m / h ] , effective temperature , @xmath0 , stellar diameter , @xmath1 ) and interstellar extinction , @xmath2 , for all @xmath3 cep stars observed by _",
    "international ultraviolet explorer _ satellite .",
    "the parameters are derived by means of an algorithmic procedure of fitting theoretical flux distributions to the low - resolution iue spectra and optical spectrophotometric observations .",
    "the errors are estimated by using the bootstrap method ( press et al .",
    "we also show some examples of high - resolution hst / ghrs spectra for one @xmath3  cep star : @xmath6 peg .",
    "the observational material consists of the iue spectra with the absolute calibration and reduction done by newsips package .",
    "the spectra were coadded if more than one spectrum was available for a star .",
    "the ultraviolet observations expressed in the absolute units were supplemented by optical spectrophotometric measurements taken from the literature .",
    "we used johnson and strmgren photometry if no optical spectrophotometric data were available .",
    "we applied the least - squares ( ls ) optimalization algorithm of fitting theoretical flux distributions to observations .",
    "this method enables us to obtain various parameters involved in stellar spectra ( @xmath0 , [ m / h ] , @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "we used theoretical models of kurucz ( 1996 ) with the value of the microturbulent velocity , @xmath7  km / s , for all stars .",
    "in addition , the mean interstellar reddening curve of fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) was adopted for the majority of the analysed objects . because of the spatial variability of the extinction law , for the field stars with @xmath8 , five additional parameters , specifying the shape of the uv extinction curve ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) were estimated . for @xmath3  cep stars in open clusters we adopted the extinction curves from massa & fitzpatrick ( 1986 ) .",
    "the surface gravity was determined as a mean value from four methods .",
    "three of them use strmgren and geneva photometry . in the last method , we estimated the gravities using the formula obtained from stellar evolutionary models computed by a. pamyatnykh ( private communication ) for opal opacities with @xmath9 .",
    "we found the following relation : @xmath10 , with the standard deviation amounts to 0.01  dex .",
    "we used hipparcos parallaxes in order to calculate @xmath11 . during the best - fit procedure",
    "the luminosity was corrected for the lutz - kelker bias ( lutz & kelker 1973 ) .",
    "the distances to the clusters were taken from the literature .",
    "the errors were estimated by using the technique of bootstrap resampling ( press et al .",
    "1992 , niemczura 2003 ) .",
    "this technique allows to get reliable uncertainties of the parameters and correlations between them .      in fig . 1",
    ", we show the @xmath12 vs. @xmath13 diagrams with observational points and theoretical instability strips for three values of @xmath14 .",
    "the mean value of the metal abundance parameter for the field stars is equal to @xmath15  dex , and ranges from @xmath16 ( 27 cma ) to @xmath17  dex ( hn aqr ) .",
    "the mean values of [ m / h ] for the stars in clusters are equal to @xmath18  dex for ngc  3293 , @xmath19 for ngc  4755 and @xmath20 for ngc  6231 .",
    "the clusters ngc  3293 and ngc  4755 have similar ages , but the @xmath3  cep instability strip in the second one is shifted to the lower temperatures .",
    "this can be explained by the lower value of [ m / h ] obtained for the ngc  4755 stars .",
    "the mean [ m / h ] for all stars we analysed is @xmath21 .",
    "these determinations are consistent with our previous results ( daszyska et al .",
    "2002 ) , obtained with the less accurate method .",
    "metal abundances of hot stars in the solar vicinity are lower by about 0.20  dex than the solar value and were reported by many authors ( see niemczura 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the values from the low - resolution iue observations are in agreement with these results . in the next step we checked whether the obtained metallicities are correlated with any stellar parameter .",
    "we found small correlations between [ m / h ] and all parameters ( from 0.17 for @xmath2 to 0.26 for @xmath0 ) , which mean that [ m / h ] can be reliably derived from the best - fit procedure .",
    "then we tried to find quantities , which can be determined by metallicity in @xmath3  cep stars .",
    "the value of the dominant period , its amplitudes of the light and radial velocity variations , as well as the projected rotational velocity are not correlated with the value of [ m / h ] , as has been already shown by daszyska et al .",
    "for more details we refer reader to niemczura & daszyska - daszkiewicz ( 2003 ) .",
    "high - quality uv spectra of @xmath6  peg have become available with goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) aboard hst .",
    "observations were made with two gratings , g160 m ( 1340  1380   ) and ech - b ( 2060  2071   ) , with the spectral resolving power of about 20.000 and 80.000 , respectively .",
    "both spectral ranges are dominated by the iron peak elements like fe , cr , mn , ni , si , zn , v and ti . in fig .",
    "2 we show a comparison of the ech - b spectrum of @xmath6  peg with the theoretical one computed with kurucz lte line - blanketed models , for [ m / h]@xmath22  dex and stellar parameters obtained from the above analysis of iue spectra .",
    "the overall fit is quite good , but for more detail analysis the abundances of elements should be determined individually .",
    "the abundance of the metals , especially of iron , in @xmath3  cephei pulsating variables is one of the fundamental parameters . in the case of main sequence b stars , values obtained from the uv spectra",
    "give mainly the estimation of [ fe / h ] . because the kurucz models are overestimated in the iron element we have to include the correction for [ m / h ] of about 0.12 dex .",
    "the metallicities of the @xmath3  cep stars predicted by the theory of pulsations are not in contradiction with most values determined by us .",
    "pamyatnykh ( 1999 ) showed that the @xmath3  cephei instability strip vanishes for @xmath23 , corresponding to [ m / h ] @xmath24 dex , and to [ m / h ] @xmath25  dex from the kurucz s fluxes .",
    "there is a few stars with the metallicity parameter lower than this limit .",
    "but we have to remember that our values give an information mainly about photospheric metal abundances . some other effects which we did not take into account ,",
    "like diffusion or element mixing may also be importantant .",
    "we did not change the mixture of elements , neither . in spite of this ,",
    "our results provide a very important information about the metallicity range for these pulsating stars .",
    "however , for asteroseismological purposes , there is a need for a detailed analysis of chemical composition , because oscillation frequencies are very sensitive to the adopted mixture .",
    "this is the aim of our future work and here we show an example of high - resolution hst / ghrs spectrum of @xmath6  peg with the best - fit of theoretical models .",
