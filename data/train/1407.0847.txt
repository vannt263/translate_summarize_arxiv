    "a granular system can be defined as an ensemble of macroscopic particles ( grains ) that collide inelastically , i.e. kinetic energy is dissipated in collisions . when the dynamics of the grains can be partitioned into sequences of two - body collisions , the system is referred to a granular gas and",
    "there is support both from experiments and computer simulations of the reliability of a kinetic theory description @xcite .",
    "one of the most used models to study granular gases is the inelastic hard sphere ( ihs ) model , whose dynamics is given in terms of free streaming followed by instantaneous inelastic collisions . for this model , all the kinetic theory machinery",
    "can be applied @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the low density limit the dynamics of the one - particle distribution function is given by the inelastic boltzmann equation @xcite and the correlation functions obey a closed set of equations @xcite .",
    "macroscopically , it is known that , in many cases , the dynamics of a granular system is reminiscent of that of a fluid .",
    "for dilute systems , hydrodynamic equations can be derived applying the chapman - enskog expansion @xcite or linear response methods @xcite , obtaining explicit expressions for the transport coefficients . in all these studies , there is a particular state which plays a specially important role ; the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) .",
    "this is a homogeneous state in which all the time dependence in the one - particle distribution function goes through the granular temperature ( defined as the second velocity moment of the velocity distribution ) . due to the inelasticity of collisions",
    ", the temperature decays monotonically in time @xcite .",
    "it is known that , for a wide class of initial conditions , the hcs is reached in the long - time limit for isolated granular gases .",
    "this fact makes that this state play , for granular gases , a similar role to the equilibrium state in the context of molecular , elastic fluids .",
    "in fact , the zeroth order in the gradients distribution in the chapman - enskog expansion is a `` local '' hcs @xcite .    despite this analogy with normal fluids ,",
    "there is also important differences . due to the macroscopic character of the grains , a granular system contains typically much less particles than a normal fluid",
    "this fact makes that the fluctuations of the macroscopic fields be of special relevance not only theoretically , but also from a practical point of view .",
    "the fluctuations of the total energy have been studied in the hcs , and explicit expressions for its variance and two - time correlation function have been obtained @xcite . with some generality , langevin - like equations for the fluctuating hydrodynamic fields",
    "have been derived to navier - stokes order @xcite , finding that there are not fluctuation - dissipation theorems of the second kind , i.e. the amplitude of the noises are not related to the transport coefficients . on the other hand ,",
    "the two - time correlation functions do decay as a macroscopic perturbation so that fluctuation - dissipation theorems of first kind hold @xcite .",
    "the study of the fluctuations in the hcs is of special relevance , because it serves as a starting point for the generalization to other states . making an analogy with normal fluids ,",
    "the equations for the fluctuating fields can be written in a intuitive manner for states that are close to the hcs .",
    "the deterministic part of the equations is the linearization of the macroscopic equations around the particular state considered .",
    "the noises can be assumed to have the same stochastic properties that in the hcs but replacing the total fields by the local actual ones . as said ,",
    "this is expected to be valid if the state is not far from the hcs , which means small gradients .",
    "in fact , this idea was applied in @xcite to calculate the total internal energy fluctuations in the stationary uniform shear flow ( usf ) state .",
    "this state is characterized by a uniform density , a constant and uniform temperature , and a flow velocity with a linear profile and , due to its simplicity , it has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions of @xcite were expected to hold only for small gradients , that for the usf means small inelasticity due to the coupling between gradients and inelasticity , which is a characteristic feature of stationary states of granular systems .",
    "the objective of this work is the study of the fluctuations of the total internal energy in the stationary usf state using kinetic theory tools .",
    "this will let us analyze the problem in general ( without any limitation to small inelasticity ) and , in particular , the differences with the `` local '' hcs results of @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the structure of these fluctuations is more complex than expected , since they are coupled to the fluctuations of the several components of the total pressure tensor . in the end , a systematic and controlled expansion in the degree of inelasticity will be done , in order to be able to get explicit results .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the ihs model is described in some detail , and the evolution equations for the relevant distributions are summarized .",
    "these equations are applied to the stationary usf state in section [ section3 ] , where the specific case of correlations of global quantities is considered . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we study the fluctuations of the total internal energy and it is shown that they are coupled to the components of the total pressure tensor as mentioned above .",
    "the complete study of all the fluctuations is carried out in section [ section5 ] .",
    "the analytical predictions are compared to molecular dynamics simulation results in section [ section6 ] , finding , in general , a good agreement .",
