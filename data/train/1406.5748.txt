    "the study of open quantum systems plays an important and fundamental role in many applications of quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "since isolation of quantum system from its surrounding environment is almost impossible , thus realistic quantum systems are open ones .",
    "we emphasize that , they exchange information with its surrounding environment . surveying and focusing on this information exchange lead us to the concept of markovian and non - markovian dynamical processes . if the degree of freedom of environment is infinite or that , the coupling between system and its environment be weak , information flow from system to environment and the quantum dynamical process is markovian .",
    "if it is comparable with the degree of freedom of the quantum system then the information flow back to system and dynamical process is non - markovian and memory effects are revealed .",
    "if the rate of the flow of the information from system to environment can be calculated then we can define the type of the quantum dynamical process .",
    "several witnesses have been provided to detect non - markovianity of dynamical process and parallel to these witnesses various measures were specified in order to identify the degree of non - markovianity .",
    "for example , wolf et al . proposed their measure by using the semigroup property of the markovian dynamical maps @xcite , rivas et al .",
    "introduced their measure based on divisibility of markovian dynamical maps @xcite , these two do not include the optimization procedure .",
    "however , several measures were presented from information exchange point of view . for instances ,",
    "breuer et al . provided a measure based on back flow of information by making use of the distinguishability notion @xcite , luo et al .",
    "proposed a non - markovianity measure via correlation based on mutual information @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in the above mention approach to determine the non - markovian process we need to optimization procedure over all initial state .",
    "we have various and relevant , but conceptually different , description for non - markovianity . our motivation in writing",
    "this work has been to try to introduce a new measure in order to detect non - markovianity and specify the degree of it which has a comprehensive physical interpretation and mathematically computable in a simple way . for this purpose ,",
    "we use the notion of `` _ _ quantum loss _ _ '' @xcite as the criteria for determining the value of lost information during the process .",
    "if we have the dynamics of lost information then we can specify the type of dynamical process . in this work",
    ", we use our measure for popular examples and will show that the obtained results are same results which obtain by other measures based on information flow , but our measure have a advantage than before measures does not require optimization procedure due to choosing the situation which the `` system + ancillary '' in maximal entangled pure state . + the work is organized as follows .",
    "in sec.ii we briefly review those appearances of quantum information theory , and introduce our model and the notions of `` _ _ coherent information _ _ '' , `` _ _ quantum loss _ _ '' and `` _ _ quantum noise _ _ '' . in sec.iii",
    "we introduce our measure based on lost information by means of the quantum loss notion . in sec.iv",
    "we use our measure for popular examples . finally in sec.v our results will be summarized in conclusions .",
    "quantum information has special properties different from classical one .",
    "quantum state of an open quantum system lost its coherence due to interacting with environment .",
    "this interaction induces an exchange of information between system and its surrounding environment , so we expect that , one can obtain much information about open quantum system by using the entropy of open quantum systems and its properties .",
    "quantum entropy was introduced by von neumann as an extension of gibbs entropy in classical statistical mechanic @xcite . here",
    ", we use von neumann entropy to investigate the properties of open quantum system during its evolution .",
    "the basis of modern information theory was based on using the definition of entropy by shannon @xcite . for a quantum state @xmath0 ,",
    "we can write the relation between von neumann entropies as @xmath1 similarly , mutual information is given by @xmath2 mutual information is bounded @xmath3 for pure bipartite state @xmath0 from eq.([c ] ) , and making use of this fact that , we can use the von neumann entropy of reduce density matrix to measure the entanglement for pure state@xcite , mutual information is rewritten as @xmath4 where @xmath5 was defined as mutual entanglement @xcite .",
    "we consider an open quantum system @xmath6 with hilbert space @xmath7 , and arbitrary density matrix @xmath8 belong to , all bounded linear operators acting on hilbert space , @xmath9 .",
    "initial mixed state @xmath8 is purified by using entanglement with an ancillary system @xmath10 with hilbert space @xmath11 , and density matrix @xmath12 belong to , all bounded linear operators acting on hilbert space , @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 s are eigenstates of @xmath10 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 are eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath6 respectively , it can be achived via a schmidt decomposition .",
    "open quantum system interact with its environment with hilbert space@xmath17 and density matrix @xmath18 .",
    "we supposed that the environment initially is in pure state .",
    "ancillary system does not evolve during the evolution and @xmath19 evolves unitarily in time , so due to these facts the total state @xmath20 is pure and remain pure in time .",
    "total state evolve under unitary operation @xmath21 , @xmath22 this construction is summarized in fig .",

    "following triangle inequality holds for quantum loss @xcite @xmath33    .",

    "@xmath35 indicates the loss of information from system to environment or back flow of information from environment to system in the quantum evolution , we will show these notions in the following section analytically .",

    ", it is converted to @xmath37 note that ternary mutual information , i.e. the center of venn diagram in fig.2 , due to monogamy of mutual information must satisfy inequality which is given by @xmath38 here we assume that the total state @xmath39 in pure state , so the ternary mutual information(the center of the venn diagram in fig.2 ) is equal to zero @xcite .",

    "now we are in a position to define our witness for detecting non - markovianity .",
    "the quantum dynamical map @xmath41 is non - markovian iff @xmath50 . in other words violation of monotonically increasing property of `` quantum loss '' under quantum dynamical process ,",
    "i.e. @xmath51 , is necessary and sufficient condition for non - markovianity of dynamical maps .",
    "according to our witness , we find that in non - markovian process the rate of the von neumann entropy of environment is less than the rate of the system s von neumann entropy @xmath52 similar to pervious work on this fields by other authors , we can introduce a measure for determining the degree of non - markovianity using this witness .",
    "the above constructions help us to make a natural measure for indicating the degree of non - markovianity of quantum dynamical map @xmath41 from quantum loss dynamics @xmath53 integral is over all time intervals @xmath54 in which @xmath50 and @xmath55 is maximally entangled pure state .",
    "mathematically , by taking the time derivative from both sides of the eq.([m ] ) we have @xmath56 which means that , increasing the quantum loss is equivalent to a reduction of mutual entanglement and vice versa . in other meaning , we can say that the dynamical map is markovian if @xmath57 , and is non - markovian iff @xmath58 . from eq.([d ] ) we observe that the mutual entanglement @xmath59 has the dimension of mutual information @xmath60 for bipartite pure states .",
    "thus , with regard to above considerations , we can reproduce the witness which were introduced by luo et al . in ref . @xcite . from their work",
    ", we have following relation for quantum mutual information of combined system `` system + ancillary '' during the quantum evolution @xmath61 i.e. if @xmath44 be a markovian quantum dynamical map then the quantum mutual information is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath62 , or in other word for any markovian dynamical maps we have @xmath63 any violation of this monotonicity is a symptom of non - markovianity .",
