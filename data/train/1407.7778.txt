    "most of molecular gas in galaxies is assembled into giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) with masses of 10@xmath610@xmath7 m@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "stars appear intimately associated with the dense regions of these gmcs @xcite , and recent observations suggest that the depletion timescale of molecular gas by star formation does not vary greatly across a wide range of galaxy environments @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that the ability to form molecular gas in the first place holds the key to understanding the evolutionary tracks of galaxies .",
    "atomic hydrogen has been considered for decades as the main formation reservoir of gmcs @xcite .",
    "although how exactly gmcs form out of the diffuse atomic medium is still not understood , the hi envelopes frequently observed around gmcs are likely to represent the material left over from the formation epoch and/or a product of photodissociation of molecular gas . in either case , these envelopes play a very important role in the gmc evolution and could explain long - standing questions such as the origin of the internal turbulent energy in gmcs .",
    "theoretical models considering the ongoing accretion of atomic material from the envelope onto gmcs are able to reproduce the level of observed turbulence , as well as the total gmc mass @xcite . in addition , it has been suggested that the gmc history is highly dependent on the initial surface density of the hi envelope . as shown by goldbaum et al . (",
    "2011 ) , only a factor of two increase of the hi surface density of the envelope from 8 to 16 m@xmath8 pc@xmath9 is enough to decide whether or not a gmc mass will reach @xmath10 m@xmath8 over a typical lifetime of 10 - 20 myr .    while the hi envelopes around molecular clouds have been largely observationally studied via hi emission @xcite , traditionally hi has not been considered as very important for understanding molecule and star formation .",
    "for example , many gmc studies trying to estimate the h@xmath11 distribution from dust emission have neglected to account for hi as it was assumed that gmcs are highly dominated by molecular gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , a strong correlation between the star formation rate and the h@xmath11 surface density in galaxies has been considered as an evidence that only h@xmath11 is directly related to star formation .",
    "however , recent extragalactic studies showed that globally across galaxies at kpc - scales , as well as in resolved studies at sub - kpc scales , the hi surface density @xmath1210 m@xmath8 pc@xmath9 @xcite , re - opening interest in the role of hi shielding in molecule formation .    to investigate the formation of h@xmath11 from a theoretical point of view , and building up on several earlier studies @xcite , @xcite ( kmt09 ) considered the structure of a photodissociation region ( pdr ) in a spherical cloud that is embedded in a uniform and isotropic radiation field .",
    "their model is based on the balance between h@xmath13 formation on dust grains and photodissociation by lyman ",
    "werner ( lw ) photons and provides an analytic function for the h@xmath13 fraction as a function of the gas surface density .",
    "their most important prediction is that a certain amount of the hi surface density , @xmath14 , is required for shielding of h@xmath13 against photodissociation . once this minimum @xmath15 is achieved , additional hi is fully converted into h@xmath13 and therefore @xmath15 saturates while @xmath16 linearly increases . at solar metallicity , kmt09 predict @xmath17 m@xmath8 pc@xmath9 as the minimum @xmath15 required for h@xmath13 formation , this is equivalent to the hi column density of @xmath18 @xmath5 .    to investigate the role of hi shielding on sub - pc scales in @xcite we mapped the transition from hi to h@xmath13 across the perseus molecular cloud m@xmath8 @xcite and solar metallicity @xcite . ] .",
    "the hi data in this study were from the galfa  hi survey @xcite and the hi column density was estimated under the optically thin assumption . to estimate the h@xmath11 image , the 60 and 100 @xmath19 m data from the improved reprocessing of the _ iras _ survey ( iris ) @xcite were used .",
    "we derived @xmath20 from the @xmath21 ratio , and then converted @xmath22 to @xmath23 by finding a proportionality constant between our derived @xmath23 and the @xmath23 image derived from optical extinction ( provided by the complete survey , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the h@xmath13 column density was calculated as : @xmath24(h@xmath13)= ( @xmath23/dgr @xmath25 @xmath24(hi))/2 ; the dust - to - gas ratio dgr = 1.1 @xmath26 10@xmath27 mag @xmath28 was measured locally around perseus .    the key result from lee et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is the detection of an almost constant @xmath15 of 68 m@xmath8 pc@xmath9 for several dark and star - forming regions in perseus .",
    "this is in agreement with kmt09 s prediction for the saturation of @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , lee et al . showed that h@xmath11 extends up to 20 pc from core centers , and that the hi envelope is very extended ( @xmath29 pc ) .",
    "the hi halo of perseus was previously studied by @xcite who focused on dark region b5 . using radiative transfer modeling they found that the hi halo is about @xmath30 pc in size .    while the observed flattening of @xmath15 can be attributed to the conversion of hi into h@xmath13 as in kmt09 , an alternative possibility is that @xmath15 is simply underestimated due to the presence of high optical depth hi which is not fully measured in emission line observations .",
    "the high optical depth hi can be measured from self - absorption features , caused by the background galactic hi emission being absorbed by the cooler foreground hi @xcite .",
    "many narrow self - absorption features have been considered as kinematically associated with co and have inferred temperature of less than 40 k and the atomic hydrogen column density fraction of only 0.0016 relative to h@xmath11 .",
    "if hi is a dissociation product of h@xmath11 , these measurements suggest a cloud age of 330 myrs @xcite .",
    "while self - absorption can provide spatial information about the cold hi , e.g. @xcite , it always requires complicated line modeling and is limited by the ability to clearly distinguish self - absorption features from temperature fluctuations and/or multiple individual line of sight components .",
    "the main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of high optical depth on the hi surface density saturation observed in lee at al .",
    "we use the most direct way to estimate the `` true '' hi column density by measuring hi absorption against radio continuum sources located behind perseus .",
    "we use these observations to investigate properties of the cold and warm hi around perseus ( paper i ) , as well as to derive the ratio of the true hi column density to the hi column density derived under the optically thin assumption ( paper ii ) .",
    "the structure of this study is organized in the following way . in this paper ( paper i )",
    "we focus on the properties of cold gas around perseus .",
    "our observing and data processing strategies are explained in section  [ s : obs ] , and in section  [ s : analysis ] we summarize the methodology used to estimate spin temperature and column density of the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) and the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) . in section  [ s : properties ] we investigate the basic physical properties of atomic gas in the perseus hi envelope , and in section  [ s : co_hi_abs ] we compare hi absorption and carbon monoxide ( co ) emission spectra .",
    "we summarize our results in section 6 . in paper",
    "ii we estimate the correction for high optical depth using our hi absorption measurements , apply this correction and re - visit the question of hi saturation in perseus .",

    "<S> using the arecibo observatory we have obtained neutral hydrogen ( hi ) absorption and emission spectral pairs in the direction of 26 background radio continuum sources in the vicinity of the perseus molecular cloud . </S>",

    "<S> basic properties of individual hi clouds ( spin temperature , optical depth , and the column density of the cold and warm neutral medium , cnm and wnm ) in and around perseus are very similar to those found for random interstellar lines of sight sampled by the millennium hi survey . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the neutral gas found in and around molecular clouds is not atypical . </S>",

    "<S> the observed cnm fraction is inversely proportional to the optical - depth weighted average spin temperature , in excellent agreement with the recent numerical simulations by kim et al . </S>",
    "<S> while the cnm fraction is on average higher around perseus relative to a random interstellar field , it is generally low , @xmath3% . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that extended wnm envelopes around molecular clouds , and/or significant mixing of cnm and wnm throughout molecular clouds , are present and should be considered in the models of molecule and star formation . </S>",
    "<S> our detailed comparison of hi absorption with co emission spectra shows that only 3/26 directions are clear candidates for probing the co - dark gas as they have @xmath4 @xmath5 yet no detectable co emission . </S>"
