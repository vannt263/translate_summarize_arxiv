    "the phenomenologically very successful cosmological ` concordance model ' , within the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , leaves us with the mystery of dark energy ( de ) .",
    "since no satisfactory explanation of de has emerged so far , it is certainly reasonable to investigate whether possible modifications of gr might change the late expansion rate of the universe .",
    "after all , gr has not yet been tested on cosmological scales .",
    "modified gravity models have to be devised such that they pass the stringent solar system tests , and are compatible with the rich body of cosmological data that support the concordance model ( @xmath0cdm model ) . at the same time",
    ", the theories should be consistent on a fundamental level .",
    "since we are dealing with higher spin equations , possible acausalities are , for instance , a serious issue .",
    "apart from all that , one should not forget that the old profound vacuum energy problem @xcite and the cosmic coincidence problem remain , and thus extreme fine tuning is unavoidable .",
    "this holds , of course , also for all dynamical models of de @xcite .    in my brief review",
    "i shall mainly concentrate on so called @xmath1 gravity .",
    "this is the simplest modification .",
    "moreover , there have been some recent developments that i find interesting . after some generalities ,",
    "many of you know very well , i shall discuss the weak field limit and solar system tests .",
    "for some time there was a lot of confusion on this issue , with conflicting statements , but was eventually clarified .",
    "we shall , however , see that the weak field approximation may break down , and a so - called chameleon mechanism can be at work that hides a scalar degree of freedom of the theory on solar system scales .    there are @xmath1 models that pass the solar system tests and are cosmologically almost indistinguishable from the successful @xmath0cdm model .",
    "recently it was , however , discovered by kobayashi and maeda that these models are in serious trouble in the strong - field regime .",
    "some of the other modified gravity theories are even in greater difficulties .",
    "this will be briefly discussed in a final part .",
    "the simplest possibility of modifying gr is to replace the einstein - hilbert action @xmath2 of gravity by a nonlinear function @xmath1 of the ricci scalar @xmath3 .",
    "this introduces an additional scalar degree of freedom that can lead to an accelerated expansion of the universe at late times , induced by the ricci scalar .",
    "one may call this `` curvature de '' or `` dark gravity '' .",
    "the function @xmath4 is quite arbitrary and the theory looses , of course , a lot of predictive power . as many other people , i regard this class of modified gravity theories as instructive phenomenological toy models , that change gravity in the _",
    "infrared_.    the variation of the gravitational action is : @xmath5 diffeomorphism invariance implies that the tensor in the curly bracket has a vanishing covariant divergence .",
    "therefore , the field equation @xmath6 implies that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath7 is divergence - free .",
    "this implies , by a general result of hawking , that matter propagates causally if @xmath7 satisfies the dominant energy condition . as expected from lovelock s theorem , the field equation is of fourth order in the metric if @xmath4 is not a linear function .",
    "it is easy to see that the de sitter or anti - de sitter metric , with @xmath8 , is a vacuum solution , if there is a constant @xmath0 satisfying @xmath9 .",
    "is obviously a vacuum solution of ( 2 ) .",
    "] this indicates that the theory may naturally lead to cosmological acceleration .",
    "more on this later .    at first sight",
    "one may think that experience and insight from gr may not help us to get some understanding of what the complicated fourth order field equations may describe .",
    "it is , however , known since long that @xmath1 gravity models can be reformulated as scalar - tensor theories @xcite , @xcite . to show this , we first rewrite the field equations in the following form ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & g_{\\alpha\\beta}\\box f'(r)+\\nabla_\\alpha\\nabla_\\beta f'(r)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is natural to introduce the scalar field @xmath12 .",

    "we shall see that this is indeed the case , but thanks to the potential term there is an interesting way out",

    "it shows that the scalar degree of freedom is truly dynamical .",
    "in contrast to gr , the scalar ricci curvature does no more track the matter distribution .",

    "the laws of physics in local inertial frames are universal , but the effective gravitational `` constant '' ( @xmath33 ) becomes space - time dependent . since the two descriptions are mathematically equivalent , observables are frame independent .",
    "it is then just a matter of convenience which one prefers to use .",
    "in what follows we will always work in the jordan frame , except at one instance .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the modified friedmann equations .",
    "we consider only friedmann - lemaitre ( -robertson - walker ) spacetimes with are spatially flat .",

    "the sign of the corresponding effective equation of state parameter @xmath41 is determined by that of @xmath42 since @xmath43 has to be non - negative .",
    "simple choices for @xmath1 give strongly negative values for @xmath44 .",
    "for example , @xmath45 gives @xmath46 . as we noted before , the effective gravitational `` constant '' in ( 12 ) and ( 13 )",
    "is @xmath47 , and is thus @xmath3-dependent .    in general none of the standard energy conditions",
    "is satisfied for @xmath1 models . in particular",
    ", @xmath48 does not have to be smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "clearly , the ` energy conservation ' @xmath49 follows , as in gr , from the field equations , i.e. , from ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) .    since @xmath50 we may regard the evolution equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) as a system of equations for @xmath51 and @xmath3 .",
    "this dynamical system has been extensively studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is a mathematical fact that for any given expansion history @xmath34 there exists a ( non - unique ) function @xmath4 that reproduces this history by the corresponding @xmath1 model .",
    "this does , however , not guarantee that the sequence of radiation - matter - acceleration eras is also reproduced .",
    "indeed , the analysis in @xcite shows that _ non - linear _ @xmath1 models that reproduce , for example , exactly the history @xmath34 of the @xmath0cdm model , do not have the right sequence of cosmological eras with the required density parameters .",
    "however , it is possible to reproduce this sequence of eras if some deviations from the given history @xmath52 are tolerated .",
    "an example for this , that is compatible with current observations , has been given by hu and sawicky @xcite .",
    "since this model will also later play a role , we present it here .",
    "its analytic form reads @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , with suitably chosen parameters @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is a positive integer , and @xmath56 denotes the present average cosmic density ) .",
    "the corresponding history leads to a curvature equation of state parameter @xmath57 that deviates from -1 , but these deviations can be kept sufficiently small . at high redshifts @xmath57 becomes smaller than -1 , a possibility that can be checked with future observations .",
    "such a crossing of the so - called phantom line would be interesting .     from hu and sawicki @xcite .",
    "( in the graph @xmath1 denotes our @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is our @xmath60 today . ) the ratio @xmath61 is fixed such that @xmath1 approaches for large @xmath62 the @xmath0cdm value .",
    "the value of @xmath62 at the present epoch is about 40 .",
    "thus only the part of the graph to the right of this value is relevant . ]",
    "we do not discuss here the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations for @xmath1 models , that may imply interesting testable deviations from the concordance model .",
    "( for some references on this , see the last section . )",
    "we remarked earlier that for @xmath1 gravity the schwarzschild or schwarzschild - de sitter metric is often a vacuum solution , e.g. , for the model ( 16 ) .",
    "this does , however , not guarantee that the theory passes solar system tests .",
    "this would be the case if this vacuum solution can be matched to an interior solution ( as schwarzschild showed for gr ) .",
    "we shall see that this is generically not possible . in this section",
    "we address this issue in the weak field limit .    as a preparation we linearize the scalar field equation ( 6 ) about a background de sitter universe with @xmath63 , where the ricci scalar @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 ( @xmath66 , etc ) .",
    "let @xmath67 , and linearize the trace equation for a local source : @xmath68 since @xmath69 vanishes for the background , we regard it as of first order .",
    "the last equation shows that the scalar field @xmath70 has an effective mass given by model ( without matter ) . ]",
    "@xmath71 after considerable confusion , it was shown in @xcite that the eddington - robertson parameter @xmath72 is not equal to 1 , as in gr and also observationally to high accuracy , but @xmath73 , if the following conditions are satisfied :    \\(i ) linearization of @xmath74 about @xmath64 is allowed .",

    "if @xmath77 , then @xmath78 as in gr . condition ( iii ) can be violated , for instance by fine tuning the parameters in @xmath79 the only way to escape the destructive consequence @xmath80 and maintain the late cosmic acceleration , is to invoke a `` chameleon mechanism '' for the scalar degree of freedom .",
    "the chameleon effect was discovered by khoury and weltman @xcite in scalar field models of de .",
    "scalar fields with self - interactions may directly couple to matter as strong ( or even stronger ) as gravity and still satisfy all current constraints .",
    "the reason for this is that the effective mass of the scalar field depends on the local density .",
    "so there is the possibility that the compton wave length is sufficiently small on earth to satisfy all laboratory bounds , while it is much larger in the solar system and still much larger on cosmological scales .    for illustration ,",

    "the dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath37 can imply that @xmath84 at the effective minimum is much smaller for a low density background than in a high density environment ( see fig .",

    "@xmath28 varies for a macroscopic body only over a thin surface layer , leading to a weak fifth force .",

    "the possibility of a chameleon mechanism for the scalar degree of freedom of @xmath1 gravity models has been studied in several papers , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we discuss here briefly part of the work by hu and sawicky @xcite .",

    "( 21 ) becomes a non - linear field equation for @xmath3 ( or @xmath24 ) .",
    "hu and sawicki choose the model ( 16 ) and impose the following boundary conditions : deep inside the star @xmath14 assumes the value with @xmath93 ( implied by gr ) . very far away",
    "( @xmath94 ) the outer boundary condition @xmath95 is imposed , where @xmath96 is the average galactic density in the solar vicinity ( @xmath97 g @xmath98 ) .",

    "so this looks very good , but it has to be emphasized , that this conclusion rests on the assumption , that the galaxy is in the high - curvature regime ( @xmath109 ) with respect to its own density profile .",
    "the validity of this assumption depends , as hu and sawicki stress , `` on both the structure of the galactic halo and its evolution during the acceleration epoch '' .",
    "this dependence is irritating , but reflects the fact that there is _ no birkhoff theorem _ for @xmath1 gravity models . to decide about the proper boundary conditions one would have to study  horribile dictu  galaxy formation for @xmath1 models in n - body simulations .",
    "we shall see in the next section that the chameleon mechanism can only work if the star has a surrounding medium , e.g. , dark matter .",
    "recently it was discovered by kobayashi and maeda @xcite that models which incorporate the chameleon mechanism can not describe relativistic stars .",

    "both of these unacceptable shortcomings have in the final analysis a common origin .",
    "the good thing about the field equations in the form ( 36 ) is that it they are of second order in the derivatives of the metric .",
    "what leads to the mentioned difficulties is that the right hand side of ( 36 ) is at least of second order in the matter variables , because @xmath3 is a function of @xmath69 .",
    "apart from ideal fluids , @xmath69 is usually of first order , and then the right hand side is even of third order in the matter fields .",
    "this induces locally sensitive dependence of the metric on rapidly changing matter fields , in contrast to gr ( and newtonian gravity ) where such dependencies are smoothed out .",
    "a positive aspect of the largely negative outcome of the previous discussion seems to me that the distinguished role of gr among large classes of gravity theories has once more become apparent . we know",
    ", of course , that gr is an effective theory , and that quantum theory will produce all sorts of induced terms ( a phenomenon that is well - known from qed ) , but stopping any expansion after a few terms will hardly lead to a consistent theory that agrees with observations on all scales .",
    "some of the modified gravity theories , such as @xmath1 or braneworld models , may perhaps be of limited use for testing gr on cosmological scales .",
    "guided by such models , there have recently been some interesting attempts to develop a parameterized post - friedmann description of gravity that parallels the parameterized post - newtonian description of solar system tests ( discussed by c. will at this meeting ) .",
