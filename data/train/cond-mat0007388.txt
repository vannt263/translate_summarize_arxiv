    "the last decade has seen a great deal of interest in spin and/or correlated electron systems on a ladder structure formed from two coupled chains . this work has been motivated both by the discovery of real materials with @xmath6 ions forming a ladder structure@xcite , and because ladder systems exhibit a number of interesting and surprising properties ( see e.g.  the review of dagotto and rice@xcite ) .",
    "particularly interesting behaviour may be expected if the system includes charge degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be achieved by doping , to create a system of strongly correlated mobile holes , as in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "systems studied include lacuo@xmath7 doped with sr@xcite and ca@xmath8cu@xmath9o@xmath10 doped with sr@xcite , the latter showing superconductivity under pressure .",
    "the @xmath11-@xmath12 and hubbard models provide alternate representations of the physics of such systems , and both have been studied extensively .",
    "references to most of the existing work on the @xmath11-@xmath12 ladder system , as well as the most recent evidence for the form of the phase diagram can be found in mller and rice@xcite .",
    "we are here interested in the repulsive ( @xmath13 ) hubbard model on a 2-leg ladder .",
    "the first study of this system , to our knowledge , was by fabrizio , parola and tosatti@xcite who used a weak - coupling renormalization group approach to investigate the role of the interchain hopping @xmath14 in driving the system out of a luttinger liquid phase .",
    "earlier work , in this context , had considered a 2-dimensional system of weakly coupled chains@xcite .",
    "further work@xcite , using bosonization techniques , valid for weak interchain coupling , has identified a number of possible phases which the 2-leg hubbard ladder may exhibit . in the notation of balents and fisher@xcite ,",
    "these are denoted as c@xmath15s@xmath16 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 represent the number of gapless charge and spin modes respectively .",
    "( here @xmath17 giving 9 possible phases ) .",
    "numerical studies of the hubbard ladder have been carried out for both static and dynamic properties .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique@xcite has been used to calculate both spin and pairing correlations@xcite , and to calculate the spin and charge gaps@xcite as functions of the parameters of the model .",
    "the dmrg technique , at least in its present form , is unable to compute the dynamic response , particulary momentum dependent properties .",
    "the one - hole spectral function has been obtained using exact diagonalizations@xcite ( limited to @xmath18 sites ) and quantum monte carlo techniques@xcite .",
    "this latter paper also reports results for two - hole spin and charge excitations .",
    "the spin - gap at half - filling , obtained by dmrg on a @xmath19 lattice@xcite showed a very sudden decrease near @xmath20 , particularly for small @xmath3 . however finite size effects are present and may mask the true behaviour .",
    "this work was motivated in part by a need to confirm this , and in fact to look for possible evidence of a phase transition near this point , as well as by a desire to explore the form of dispersion curves for spin and charge excitations , which can not be obtained by dmrg methods .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard ladder is written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 labels the rungs of the ladder , @xmath23 ( = 1,2 ) is a leg index , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) is the spin index , and the operators have the usual meaning .",
    "there are several instructive limiting cases . when @xmath27 the electrons are non - interacting and the system has two simple cosine bands of width @xmath28 and separation @xmath29 .",
    "the system is metallic for all electron densities @xmath15 , except for the case @xmath30 ( half - filling ) and @xmath31 when there is a band gap and the lower ( bonding ) band is completely filled .",
    "the case is aptly referred to as a  band insulator\"@xcite . on the other hand",
    "when the interchain hopping @xmath32 ( and @xmath13 ) the ladder decouples to two hubbard chains for which there are exact , but highly nontrivial solutions .",
    "the system is then in a luttinger liquid phase , and also an insulator at half - filling .    when both @xmath14 and @xmath3 are non - zero there are no exact results known .",
    "however the form of the phase diagram can be reasonably inferred from the analytic and numerical calculations referred to above . a nice discussion is given by noack _",
    "et al._@xcite . in the limit of large @xmath3",
    "doubly occupied sites are suppressed and the model reduces to a @xmath11-@xmath12 ladder , with parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the hubbard ladder has electron hole symmetry under the transformation @xmath35 the phase diagram and properties of the model are thus symmetric about the @xmath30 case .",
    "we see manifestations of this in the series for various excitation energies , discussed below . in this paper",
    "we study the hubbard ladder using both the method of series expansions@xcite and dmrg@xcite . the series expansion method is complementary to other numerical methods and is able to provide ground state properties , excitation spectra and @xmath0 critical points to high accuracy .",
    "another advantage is that one deals with a system in the thermodynamic limit and finite size corrections are not needed .",
    "we have used this approach recently in studies of the @xmath11-@xmath12 model on the square lattice@xcite and on a 2-leg ladder@xcite , and we refer to those papers for details of the method and references to previous work .",
    "the emphasis of our work is on the half - filled case @xmath30 , and on one and two - hole excitations from half - filling .",
    "the series method is not well suited to handle variable electron density .",
    "we are not aware of any previous series work on the hubbard ladder .",
    "shi and singh@xcite have used a somewhat different series approach to study the hubbard model on the square lattice .",
    "their method , which introduces an artificial antiferromagnetic ising term into the hamiltonian is not appropriate here , as we do not expect any magnetic long range order in the ladder system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss briefly the methods used . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the system at half - filling . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the system with one and two holes .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "the series expansion method is based on a linked cluster formulation of standard rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory .",
    "we use a  rung basis \" and write the hamiltonian in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is taken to be the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath38 is the perturbation .",
    "thus @xmath39 describes decoupled rungs , and can be solved exactly while the intrachain hopping term couples the rungs and is treated perturbatively .",
    "the hamiltonian for a single rung has 16 possible states .",
    "these are shown in table i. for @xmath40 the lowest energy rung state is a spin - singlet containing two electrons ( state 0 in table i ) . at @xmath41",
    "there is a level crossing and the lowest energy rung state becomes a doublet @xmath6 state with a single electron in a symmetric ( bonding ) state for @xmath42 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath39 are then direct products constructed from the possible rung states .",
    "the ground state of @xmath39 for the half - filling system ( @xmath30 ) is the state that has each rung in a spin singlet .",
    "this is true even for @xmath42 , as transferring an electron from a doubly occupied rung to another doubly occupied rung costs energy .    to compute the perturbation series we fix the values of @xmath14 and @xmath3 and expand in powers of @xmath43 . without loss of generality we set @xmath44 to define the energy scale .",
    "the series are then evaluated at the desired value of @xmath11 using standard pad approximants and integrated differential approximants@xcite .",
    "we have also carried out large - scale dmrg calculations@xcite .",
    "two different dmrg algorithms have been employed . both are ` infinite lattice ' algorithms @xcite with open boundary conditions .",
    "the first method uses a superblock consisting of the usual system and environment blocks with two added rungs in the middle .",
    "the system / environment blocks are augmented by one rung at a time and the superblocks always have an even number of rungs .",
    "the second method is similar except that only one rung is kept in the middle , meaning that the superblocks have an odd number of rungs .",
    "the second method allows more states to be retained in the blocks , whilst the even lattices dealt with in the first method are usually considered to be more desirable for finite - size scaling ( fss ) studies .",
    "for the first method typical calculations involve ladders with up to 60 rungs , keeping up to 550 states per block . for the second method the superblocks",
    "studied typically reached 81 rungs and up to 1500 states were retained per block .",
    "it should be noted that the ` infinite lattice ' algorithm , despite its name , can be used to obtain accurate results for finite lattices , as we shall show in what follows .",
    "we first consider the ground state energy @xmath1 at half - filling .",
    "the series method yields an expansion of @xmath45 the series have been computed to order @xmath46 for various @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficients for @xmath48 are given in table ii , and the other coefficients can be provided on request .",
    "the cluster data for this one - dimensional problem are trivial .",
    "the limiting factor is the size of the matrices used in obtaining the cluster energies .",
    "dmrg gives the ground state energy directly for a given lattice , and finite - size scaling must be used to extract the bulk result .    in figure [ fig_2 ]",
    "we show our results for the ground state energy in the half - filled case versus @xmath11 for various @xmath47 obtained both by series expansions and dmrg calculations . for given @xmath11 the energy increases with @xmath3 as expected . for fixed @xmath3",
    "the energy decreases slowly with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the series are well converged for @xmath49 , but the convergence deteriorates rapidly at that value .",
    "the dmrg is , however , well converged even for larger @xmath11 and agrees well with the series results for smaller @xmath11 .",
    "a remarkable feature of the ground state energy is the sharp downturn which occurs near @xmath50 for @xmath51 , but which becomes smoother for larger @xmath3 . for the case of free electrons ( @xmath27 )",
    "the ground state energy is exactly @xmath52 } , & $ t / t_{\\perp } > 1/2$.\\cr } % \\ ] ] and , as mentioned above , the crossover represents a transition from band insulator to a conductor with gapless charge and spin excitations .",
    "the qualitative similarity between the @xmath27 case and small @xmath3 ( e.g.   @xmath53 in the figure ) suggests that spin excitations may remain gapless , or nearly so , for small finite @xmath3 and large @xmath11 .",
    "we can compare our results for the ground state energy with those of kim _",
    "et al._@xcite , obtained via a variational method .",
    "these are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the results are in good agreement for small @xmath5 , but it appears that the variational method significantly over estimates the ground state energy for large @xmath5 .",
    "we now turn to the excitations , which we have computed directly using gelfand s method@xcite .",
    "the lowest energy spin excitation branch results from exciting a rung from a spin singlet ( state 0 in table i ) to a triplet ( any of states 5,6,7 in table i ) .",
    "nonzero @xmath11 allows this to propagate coherently along the chain , giving rise to a triplet magnon excitation .",
    "figure [ fig_3 ] shows dispersion curves @xmath54 for this excitation for fixed @xmath55 and various @xmath47 . for larger @xmath5 the series",
    "become too erratic . for all cases",
    "the energy minimum occurs at @xmath56 .",
    "as @xmath3 increases the bandwidth of the spin excitation decreases .",
    "the excitation energy at @xmath56 defines the spin gap @xmath57 .",
    "the raw data are shown in figure [ fig_4 ] , where we plot @xmath58 versus @xmath5 for various @xmath47 . for small @xmath11",
    "our series give rather precise estimates . in the limit @xmath59 the spin gap is @xmath60 which is @xmath61 for @xmath27 and decreases for increasing @xmath3 .",
    "near @xmath620.5 there is a crossover and beyond this point the spin gap for large @xmath3 exceeds that for small @xmath3 . for @xmath63",
    "this crossover becomes very sharp .",
    "the series extrapolations would indicate that the spin gap actually vanishes at @xmath64 , but we believe this is an artefact of poor convergence in this region .",
    "it is expected@xcite that at half - filling the system will have a finite spin gap throughout the phase diagram for any @xmath13 , due to ` umklapp ' processes .",
    "it is clear however that the spin gap becomes quite small for @xmath65 .",
    "we have also used our dmrg algorithms to calculate @xmath2 . in order to obtain insight into the potential limitations of dmrg methods for this problem",
    ", we consider the finite - size scaling of @xmath2 in the exactly solvable @xmath66 case .",
    "as mentioned , for @xmath66 , the system is gapped for @xmath67 and gapless for @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_5a ] we plot @xmath2 as a function of @xmath69 for three values of the ratio @xmath70 . for @xmath71 ( just below the critical ratio )",
    ", the system has a small spin gap , and @xmath2 scales smoothly to its bulk value , the finite - size corrections vanishing as @xmath72 ( as is to be expected for a gapped system with open boundary conditions ) . for @xmath73 ( just above the critical ratio ) ,",
    "the gap suddenly begins to display a  sawtooth \" dependence on @xmath74 , with the points of the saw scaling towards zero as @xmath75 .",
    "this behaviour becomes more pronounced as we move further beyond the critical ratio .",
    "it appears that multiple crossovers are occurring , with new states crossing over to the bottom of the spectrum as @xmath74 increases .",
    "these sawtooth oscillations are presumably due to the 2-band structure : every so often it is is energetically favorable for an extra electron to be added to the top band rather than the bottom band , and a crossover occurs .",
    "this oscillatory behaviour hs not been exhibited before , as far as we are aware . in order to calculate the bulk spin gap successfully with dmrg",
    ", we must first accurately calculate @xmath2 for a number of lattice sizes @xmath74 , and then extrapolate to the bulk limit , assuming some scaling ansatz for the finite @xmath74 corrections .",
    "an example of this is shown in table [ table_3 ] , where we compare dmrg and exact results for @xmath2 for finite lattices and the bulk limit .",
    "in this case , where the fss is smooth , it is possible to obtain a reasonable estimate for the bulk spin gap , the real error being around 0.1% .",
    "two potential problems emerge from our studies of gapless systems in the @xmath66 case for @xmath76 .",
    "firstly , because of the oscillating fss it might be difficult to obtain accurate dmrg results for very large lattices in a regime where the gap is small or vanishing . convergence of finite lattice results with the number of states , @xmath16 , retained per block , must be monitored over a large range of @xmath16 values . for a given lattice size ,",
    "improved dmrg estimates can be obtained by using a finite lattice algorithm @xcite . however , even if highly accurate results are available for a number of lattice sizes , a second and more pressing problem is that , as a result of the oscillations or erratic fss , extremely large lattices may be needed in order to reach a regime where a suitable scaling ansatz can be reliably used to extrapolate to the bulk limit , as can be seen for the gapless cases in fig .",
    "[ fig_5a ] .    fortunately , the presence of electron repulsion smooths out the fss , allowing reliable dmrg estimates of @xmath2 some way beyond @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] , we show the fss of dmrg estimates of @xmath2 in the @xmath78 case for various @xmath70 .",
    "we find that up to around @xmath79 , the corrections to the bulk results for @xmath2 scale as @xmath80 , as in the gapped case for @xmath66 .",
    "as @xmath70 is increased , however , we observe initially oscillatory or erratic fss , followed by a crossover to linear dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath81 , as might be expected for a system with a small gap .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] for the @xmath82 case , where a crossover to linear behaviour is observed as the lattice size reaches around 30 rungs . as mentioned , it is important to first assess the dmrg convergence for the finite lattices before attempting extrapolations . in table",
    "[ table_4 ] , we show the dmrg convergence of @xmath2 with @xmath16 for the odd - rung algorithm , with @xmath16 ranging from 200 to 1500 .",
    "it can be seen in this case that the finite lattice estimates are sufficiently well converged to afford reliable extrapolations . in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] results from the odd - rung algorithm with @xmath83 are plotted along with results from the even - rung algorithm with @xmath84 .",
    "good agreement can be seen between the two sets of results in the linear regime . in order to make bulk estimates for @xmath85 , we assume a linear scaling ansatz . presumably , if the resulting estimate is non - zero , as is the case , e.g. , for @xmath82 , there should be a crossover from linear to quadratic scaling for larger lattices still , in which case the estimates are ( tight ) lower bounds on the spin gap . for the case of @xmath78 , we can carry this out up until @xmath70 reaches around 0.75 . beyond this value ,",
    "the fss is too erratic to permit accurate finite lattice estimates of the spin gap for sufficiently large lattices . in the inset to fig .  5 this erratic fss",
    "is shown for the @xmath86 case .",
    "plots of the dmrg bulk estimates of @xmath2 as functions of @xmath70 are included in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] .",
    "the spin gap obtained in this way is indistinguishable from the series values for small @xmath11 .",
    "however , the dmrg also provides well converged results for larger @xmath11 provided that @xmath3 is not too small . in the @xmath87 case , for example , @xmath2 undergoes a very rapid decrease up till @xmath88 , and then flattens out at a small but finite value .",
    "the same behaviour was already seen in the previous dmrg calculation of noack _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite did their calculation at a fixed lattice size @xmath19 sites , however , whereas we performed a careful finite - size scaling analysis to confirm that the spin gap remains finite , rather than scaling to zero in the bulk limit .    in the case",
    "@xmath89 case , a similar effect occurs , but the fss behaviour becomes completely erratic and the extrapolations fail at around @xmath90 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] we depict the region in the @xmath91-@xmath92 plane where the dmrg either fails to give reasonable results due to erratic fss , or indicates a very small or vanishing gap , by marking it with an `` f '' .",
    "also included in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] is the line where the series appear to give a vanishing spin gap .",
    "this line indicates the crossover in the physics of the system from band - insulator to strongly correlated mott insulator .",
    "as mentioned in section [ intro ] there is considerable interest in the doped hubbard ladder where the electron density @xmath93 .",
    "the series method is not well suited to study the effect of finite doping .",
    "however we are able to compute the ground state and excitation energies when the system contains one or two holes .      in the @xmath59",
    "limit a single hole will change one of the singlet rung states into an @xmath94 or @xmath95 bonding state , with an energy increase of @xmath96 .",
    "finite @xmath11 will allow the hole to propagate along the ladder , giving a quasiparticle band .",
    "figure [ fig_7 ] shows the quasiparticle excitation energy @xmath97 as a function of wavenumber for the case @xmath55 and various @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath27 we have the exact results @xmath98 and this is seen through the vanishing of all higher terms in the series . for the choice",
    "@xmath55 this gives @xmath99 at @xmath56 .",
    "we also show , for comparison , the approximate dispersion curve for @xmath100 obtained by endres _ et al._@xcite , through their  local rung approximation \" .",
    "this appears to overestimate the energy by about @xmath101 , although the overall shape is very similar .    for increasing @xmath3",
    "the energies are depressed and there is a small decrease in the quasiparticle bandwidth although the overall cosine shape remains .",
    "the minimum of the quasiparticle spectrum occurs at @xmath56 throughout .",
    "the energy zero is taken to be the ground state energy of the half - filled ladder .",
    "each quasiparticle band crosses the zero level , indicating that the overall energy of the system is reduced when a hole is created , and this is also marked in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] .",
    "figure [ fig_8 ] shows the  quasiparticle gap \" as a function of @xmath5 for various @xmath47 obtained from the series and from dmrg .",
    "both methods agree up to @xmath4 , beyond which the series fail to converge .",
    "this is the same crossover region seen in the spin gap studies .",
    "the dmrg results suggest an upturn or change in slope for larger @xmath5 and not very large @xmath3 , as shown in the figure for @xmath102 .",
    "however this remains somewhat speculative as the scaling behaviour of the dmrg estimates is unusual .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ fig_9 ] , where we plot the gap ( for @xmath89 ) versus @xmath103 .",
    "the behaviour shows a qualitative change between @xmath55 and 0.6 becoming oscillatory and with a change of sign of limiting slope .",
    "nevertheless the larger @xmath104 points scale quite well .",
    "et al._@xcite saw s similar break in the behaviour of the charge gap at the crossover for @xmath100 .",
    "we would also like to explore the system doped with two holes , to see if binding occurs between the holes . from table",
    "i , one can see that at zeroth order ( @xmath59 ) , the energy gap for two holes sitting on the same rung is @xmath105 , which is larger than the gap @xmath106 for two holes on different rungs .",
    "thus it is not energetically favourable to have two holes on the same rung .",
    "our present series methods , unfortunately , are unable to treat the latter case of two holes on separate rungs :",
    "so here we restrict ourselves to exploring whether the former state becomes bound at larger @xmath11 .",
    "one starts from a state with both holes on a single rung and all other rungs in spin singlet states ; and then the hopping term allows these holes to move along the ladder , and so generates a dispersion relation for this state .",
    "for example at @xmath107 , our second order series result for the dispersion is @xmath108 one can see that the minimum energy is at @xmath56 , rather than @xmath109 , due to the fact that this is not the lowest energy two - hole state . comparing with the one - hole dispersion relation , we find no evidence for binding of this state at higher @xmath11 .",
    "our series results do not preclude the existence of a two - hole bound state of more complex structure , and there are indications from other work that this can occur .",
    "et al._@xcite find , for a @xmath19 lattice , a small binding energy ( @xmath110 ) for two holes , and a pair wavefunction which has roughly equal amplitudes on a rung and between nearest neighours along the same leg of the ladder .",
    "finite size effects may be large enough to mask the true behaviour .",
    "et al._@xcite also discuss pair formation using both dmrg and a variational method .",
    "they conclude that , at least for large @xmath3 , holes favour adjacent rungs to minimise the coulomb energy .",
    "our series method is unable to explore such complex pair states .",
    "instead , we have used the dmrg method to compute the minimum energy of the system with one and two holes , up to ladders of size @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , and hence the binding energy defined by @xmath113 - e_0 ( l-1,l-1 ) + e_0(l , l )   % 2 e_0 ( l , l-1 ) - e_0(l , l ) - e_0 ( l-1,l-1 ) % \\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the ground state energy with @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) up ( down ) electrons .",
    "we show this as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath117 in figure [ fig_12 ] . as can be seen",
    ", there is no binding for small @xmath5 , and the binding energy is zero , corresponding to an unbound , well seperated pair of holes . for @xmath5 larger than a critical value @xmath118 , however , hole binding becomes energetically favourable .",
    "in fact as we can see from figure [ fig_12 ] , @xmath119 increases from zero extremely quickly once past the critical @xmath118 .",
    "now the binding of two holes is expected to be a necessary though not sufficient precondition for the phenomenon of phase separation ( binding of many holes ) .",
    "figure [ fig_12 ] leads us suppose that phase separation may well occur for large @xmath5 ; or else at fixed @xmath120 , phase separation may well occur at small @xmath47 .",
    "this would accord with our current knowledge of the @xmath121 ladder , where the exchange coupling @xmath122 , and phase separation occurs@xcite at small @xmath123 , i.e. small @xmath124 .",
