    "situations where interference is known non - causally at the transmitter but not at the receiver model several useful multiuser communication scenarios . in @xcite , costa introduced and studied coding for such situations and called it `` writing on dirty paper '' . dirty paper coding ( dpc ) is now recognized as a powerful notion central to approaching capacity on multiuser channels .",
    "lattice - based ideas for dpc were suggested and shown to be capacity - approaching in @xcite .",
    "recently , many designs of lattice - based dpc schemes have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "lattice - based schemes typically use cosets of a convolutional code for lattice - quantizing or shaping to minimize the energy of the difference of the coded symbols and the interfering symbols .",
    "a part of the message bits is used to choose the specific coset used in the minimization .",
    "in addition to the shaping convolutional code , an error correction code needs to be used to obtain coding gain and approach capacity .",
    "the main source of complexity in lattice - based dpc designs is combining shaping and coding encoders / decoders at the transmitter / receiver .",
    "simple concatenation schemes are not applicable because of the following reasons - outer shaping followed by inner coding results in unshaped parity symbols that increase transmitted energy , while outer coding followed by inner shaping results in a poor inner code that needs to be iteratively decoded at the receiver with the outer code .    in @xcite , encoding is done on a combined trellis of the source code ( turbo tcq ) and a channel code ( turbo tcm ) . at the receiver , decoding is done for turbo tcm followed by syndrome computation to recover message bits .",
    "the transmitter is complex in @xcite because of the use of the joint trellis .",
    "the dpc method proposed in @xcite is similar to that of @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "multilevel coding is used , and there are different codes for different bits of the symbols . at the receiver , iterations have to be performed between decoders for some of the channel codes and the shaping decoder . in @xcite and @xcite , shaping follows channel coding and the receiver performs iterations between the shaping and channel decoders .    in this work",
    ", we propose a lattice - based method that uses a novel combination of a convolutional code for sign - bit shaping and a low density parity check ( ldpc ) code for channel coding .",
    "as shown in specific designs and simulations , the method provides good shaping and coding gains at moderate complexity .",
    "the main idea for reducing complexity at the receiver is the introduction of a one - codeword delay at the transmitter , and the shaping of symbols from current message bits combined with parity bits from the previous codeword .",
    "this enables the ldpc decoder to be run first at the receiver ( with a one - codeword delay ) without any need for iterations with a shaping decoder . as an application ,",
    "we use the proposed dpc method to design codes for superposition coding in two - user gaussian broadcast channels . by simulations , we show that rate points outside the time - sharing region are achieved .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . after a brief review of the lattice - based dpc coding method in section [ cls ] , we present the proposed dpc method in section [ ps ] .",
    "this is followed by description and simulation of specific designs of dpc codes in section [ sr ] . in section [ bc ] , design of a superposition scheme using the proposed dpc method is described and simulation results are presented . concluding remarks are made in section [ conc ] .",
    "in a gaussian dirty paper channel , the received symbol vector @xmath0 $ ] is modeled as @xmath1 where @xmath2 $ ] denotes the transmitted vector , @xmath3 $ ] denotes the interfering vector assumed to be known non - causally at the transmitter and @xmath4 denotes the additive gaussian noise vector .",
    "the transmit power is assumed to be upper - bounded by @xmath5\\leq p_x$ ] per symbol , and the interference power is denoted @xmath6= p_s$ ] per symbol . the noise variance per symbol is denoted @xmath7 . in @xcite , costa shows that the capacity of the dirty paper channel is @xmath8 i.e. known interference can be canceled perfectly at the transmitter .",
    "the interfering vector @xmath9 is used as an input in the encoding process and plays an important role to determine a suitable transmit vector @xmath10 . a coding strategy for choosing",
    "@xmath10 needs to overcome the imminent addition of @xmath9 and protect the transmitted information from the addition of the noise @xmath4 .",
    "such coding strategies are called dirty paper coding ( dpc ) methods .    in @xcite , a dirty paper coding ( dpc )",
    "scheme based on lattice strategies was proposed and shown to achieve the capacity of the dirty paper channel .",
    "we follow @xcite for a brief review of the transmitter and receiver structure in the lattice dpc method @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 denote an @xmath12-dimensional lattice with fundamental voronoi region @xmath13 having averaged second moment @xmath14 and normalized second moment @xmath15 . also let @xmath16 i.e. @xmath17 is a random variable ( dither ) uniformly distributed over @xmath13 .",

    "note that the dither is assumed to be known at the transmitter and receiver ( say , through the use of a common seed in a random number generator ) .",
    "the proposed scheme uses a convolutional code for sign - bit shaping @xcite and low density parity check ( ldpc ) codes for channel coding . we assume a @xmath28-pam signal constellation with a carefully chosen bit - to - symbol mapping that is compatible with sign - bit shaping and bit - interleaved coded modulation ( bicm ) @xcite . for @xmath29 , the constellation and mapping",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ 16pam ] .",
    "the mapping in fig .",
    "[ 16pam ] is suited for sign - bit shaping , since a flip of the most significant bit results in a significant change in symbol value for all possible 4-bit inputs . also , the mapping is mostly gray except for a few symbol transitions .",
    "gray mapping is known to be the most effective mapping for bicm with ldpc codes .",
    "this heuristic choice of mapping enables the possibility of good shaping and coding gains to be obtained simultaneously .",
    "as expected , larger values of @xmath28 will result in larger shaping gains in our design , and we stick to the 16-pam shown in fig .",

    "note that we need the rate of the convolutional code to be @xmath50 .",
    "let the coset chosen by @xmath51 be denoted @xmath52 .",
    "the sign - bit vector @xmath47 is chosen from @xmath52 so as to minimize the squared sum ( energy ) of the vector @xmath53 , where @xmath21 is the mmse factor and @xmath9 is the interference vector .",

    "this permutation is necessary in an implementation of bicm @xcite .",
    "note that both the shaping and coding objectives have been met at the encoder .",
    "the transmitted symbols @xmath64 have minimal energy in the lattice defined by sign - bit shaping using the convolutional code . selected bits in successive blocks of symbols form codewords of the ldpc code . in summary ,",
    "the encoder structure achieves dpc shaping and ldpc coding with bit - interleaved modulation .",
    "the decoder for the proposed scheme is as shown in fig.[decoder ] .",
    "the demapper computes log likelihood ratios ( llrs ) for the bits from the received symbols in @xmath65 .",

    "now , the @xmath33-bit sign vector is passed through the syndrome former to recover the remaining @xmath71 message bits .",
    "the demapper function at the receiver has to calculate llrs taking into account the modulo @xmath28 operation at the encoder @xcite .",
    "therefore , the received constellation @xmath72 is a replicated version of the @xmath28-pam constellation @xmath73 used at the transmitter ( assuming that scaling factors have been corrected at the receiver ) .",
    "that is , @xmath74 the number of replications @xmath75 is chosen so that the average power of @xmath72 is approximately equal to the total average power @xmath76 , and the bit mapping of the symbol @xmath77 @xmath78 is the same as that for @xmath79 .",
    "the llr for the @xmath39-th bit in the @xmath80-th symbol @xmath81 is computed according to the constellation @xmath72 using the following formula : @xmath82 since the constellation mapping is nearly gray , iterations with the demapper do not provide significant improvements in coding gain , particularly for large @xmath28 .",
    "for simulations , we have taken @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 with @xmath29 ; this results in @xmath86 .",
    "the constellation mapping is as given in fig .",
    "[ 16pam ] .",
