    "an approach to spin - sensitive devices for electronic applications , that may exhibit improved spin injection , is the use of iii - v diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss).@xcite these alloys , which incorporate a small percentage of magnetic atoms into the semiconductor host , have been shown to exhibit ferromagnetic behavior up to 110 k.@xcite however , for these materials to find widespread applications , the ferromagnetism should be stable at room temperature .",
    "consequently , much of the current experimental work is directed towards increasing their ferromagnetic transition temperature , @xmath8 . since theory predicts that the transition temperature increases with the magnetic - ion concentration ,",
    "efforts have centered on increasing such concentration.@xcite the solubility of magnetic ions , however , is often quite low .",
    "iii - v dms have been grown using low - temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( lt - mbe ) at temperatures lower than 300 @xmath4c  to prevent phase separation .",
    "nevertheless , recently we have demonstrated the growth of single - phase , ferromagnetic in@xmath0mn@xmath1as , with @xmath9 , using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy ( movpe ) at temperatures as high as 520 @xmath4c.@xcite in this report , we present the results of our investigation of the magnetic properties of these films .",
    "we have observed room - temperature ferromagnetic behavior in a nominally single - phase @xmath10-type in@xmath11mn@xmath12as film .",
    "in contrast , a comparable high @xmath8 has not been observed in single - phase ( in , mn)as grown using lt - mbe .",
    "a possible mechanism for the observed high - temperature ferromagnetism , based on transition metal clustering at the atomic level , will be discussed .",
    "( in , mn)as films were prepared using atmospheric pressure movpe , as described earlier.@xcite films were grown at temperatures between 475520 @xmath4c  on semi - insulating gaas(001 ) substrates .",
    "the precursors used were trimethylindium ( tmin ) , tricarbonyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)manganese ( tcmn ) and 0.3% arsine ( ash@xmath13 ) in hydrogen .",
    "phase composition was determined using double - crystal x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using cu k@xmath14 radiation .",
    "energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) was used to determine the mn concentration in the films .",

    "the rocking - curve fwhm for this film was 0.25@xmath4 .",

    "excellent epitaxial alignment is observed despite the @xmath18 lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate .",
    "mnas was observed in films grown at temperatures lower than 475 @xmath4c  and for mn concentrations greater than @xmath19 .",
    "growth at temperatures higher than @xmath20 @xmath4c  resulted in very little deposition presumably due to increased indium and manganese desorption from the surface .",
    "the magnetic properties of the ( in , mn)as thin films were measured using a squid magnetometer .",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the plane of the film along the easy axis of magnetization for ( in , mn)as.@xcite the substrate diamagnetic contribution was subtracted from the total magnetization signal .",
    "the remaining data consisted of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions from the film .",
    "the total magnetization is given by : @xmath21h\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the ferromagnetic component of the film , @xmath23 is the paramagnetic susceptibility of the film , @xmath24 is the substrate diamagnetic susceptibility , @xmath25 is the temperature , and @xmath26 is the applied magnetic field . the magnetic response of a nominally single - phase in@xmath11mn@xmath12as film is shown in figure [ fig3 ] for applied magnetic fields up to 20 koe and temperatures of 5 , 150 and 300 k.    magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field for a in@xmath11mn@xmath12as sample ( ajb070 ) measured at 5 , 150 , and 300 k. magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the plane of the film .",
    "inset is the complete hysteresis loop at 5 k. ]    the inset of figure [ fig3 ] shows the complete hysteresis loop for this sample at 5 k. at this temperature the measured saturation magnetization normalized to the film volume was 62 emu/@xmath7 with a remanence of 10 emu/@xmath7 and a coercive field of 400 oe .",
    "when the temperature was increased to 300 k , the saturation magnetization decreased only to 49 emu/@xmath7 .",
    "the magnetization as a function of temperature was measured for the single - phase in@xmath11mn@xmath12as sample discussed above .",
    "the sample was zero - field cooled and then subjected to a 10 koe applied magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the film .",
    "after subtraction of the diamagnetic substrate contribution , the resulting magnetization is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "a curie temperature of 333 k was measured for this sample .",
    "such a high curie temperature for a iii - v dilute magnetic semiconductor has been previously attributed to the presence of mnas@xcite which has a curie temperature of 318 k. however , the presence of mnas was not observed by x - ray diffraction in this sample as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "if a second phase were present , the measured magnetization of 62 emu/@xmath7 would correspond to a mnas volume fraction of approximately 10% .",
    "this should certainly be observable by x - ray diffraction .",
    "if on the other hand the mnas was present as nanoprecipitates , the magnetization would be considerably smaller as observed in ( ga , mn)as films.@xcite thus the magnetization data is consistent with the alloy film being a single - phase .",
    "currently , we are investigating precipitate formation further through transmission electron microscopic analysis .",
    "the value of the saturation magnetization of ( in , mn)as is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the nominal concentration of mn ions , @xmath29 is the lande factor and is equal to 2 for mn , @xmath30 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath31 is the spin of mn .",
    "the measured @xmath32 using @xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath28=1.8@xmath3310@xmath34 @xmath35 , gives a value of @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to a value of @xmath31 between 4/2 and 3/2 .",
    "this is interpreted as an indication of the presence of valence states other than mn@xmath37.@xcite    the temperature dependence of the magnetization was compared to the brillouin function for different values of the total angular momentum , @xmath38 .",
    "the lack of agreement between the brillouin function and the measured data above 150 k indicates that the transition to the ferromagnetic state may not be second order , in which the change in magnetization value is continuous with increasing temperature .",
    "it may be first order .",
    "magnetic disordering as a first order phase transformation has previously been reported and a model to describe this behavior was developed by bean and rodbell.@xcite the model predicts that if the exchange interaction is a strong function of the inter - atomic spacing and the lattice is compressible , then the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition will be first - order . by introducing a strain energy term into the free energy formulation and minimizing with respect to the reduced magnetization , it was shown@xcite that the temperature dependence of the magnetization for @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41",
    ", @xmath42 is the reduced magnetization ( normalized to the saturation magnetization ) , @xmath43 is the number of magnetic dipoles per unit volume , @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath45 is the compressibility , @xmath46 is the slope of the dependence of @xmath8 on volume , and @xmath47 is the curie temperature if the lattice were not compressible . @xmath48 and @xmath25 are the pressure and temperature respectively .    for @xmath49 ,",
    "the transition is second order , and equation [ eq2 ] reduces to the brillouin function for @xmath50 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the transition is first order and the magnetization exhibits a discontinuity at the transition temperature .",
    "the measured magnetization was compared with the model of bean and rodbell for different values of @xmath52 as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "temperature dependence of the magnetization for the in@xmath11mn@xmath12as sample ( ajb070 ) compared with the model of bean and rodbell for @xmath39 and @xmath53.@xcite magnetic field strength was 10 koe an was applied perpendicular to the plane of the film .",
    "a @xmath54 k and @xmath55 emu/@xmath7 were used for the fitting . ]    as can be seen , the best fit occurred for @xmath56 .",
    "this indicates that the phase transformation for the alloy has an intermediate character between first and second order .",
    "a deviation between theory and experiment at temperatures above the curie temperature was also observed .",
    "this was addressed in the initial work by bean and rodbell and is a consequence of the long - range interaction implicit in the model.@xcite molecular field theory which was used in the model , indicates no order above the curie temperature for a normal ferromagnet .",
    "experimentally , however , significant short - range order can be observed .    for comparison ,",
    "the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition of mnas has been shown to be first - order@xcite with a value of @xmath57.@xcite we have measured the temperature dependence of the magnetization for an ( in , mn)as sample which exhibited mnas phase formation .",
    "the magnetization is shown in figure [ fig5 ] as a function of temperature .",
    "temperature dependence of the magnetization for a two phase sample ( in@xmath58mn@xmath59as + mnas ) ( ajb076 ) compared with the model of bean and rodbell for @xmath39 and @xmath53 .",
    "magnetic field strength was 1 koe and was applied perpendicular to the plane of the film .",
    "a @xmath60 k and @xmath61 emu/@xmath7 were used for fitting . ]    in this case the temperature dependence appears to be clearly first - order .",
    "fitting of the magnetization data using the first - order model resulted in a value of @xmath62 .",
    "thus it can be seen that the temperature dependence of the magnetization for ( in , mn)as / mnas two phase alloys differs from that of ( in , mn)as single - phase alloys .",
    "the temperature dependent magnetization of in@xmath11mn@xmath12as sample shown in figure [ fig4 ] is closer to second - order and can not simply be explained by the presence of mnas nanoprecipitates .      the ferromagnetism observed in iii - v dms films has been previously explained within the framework of sp - d exchange interactions between the fermi sea and the localized magnetic moments.@xcite similar to rkky theory , this hole - mediated ferromagnetism theory predicts that the curie temperature is dependent upon both magnetic ion concentration and hole concentration . using this model dietl et al . predicted",
    "that the transition temperature for ( in , mn)as with a mn concentration of 5% should be 35 k , which is much lower than that observed in the present study .",
    "one possible explanation for the difference is that mn in the alloy is not randomly distributed on in sites but is present as atomic clusters .",
    "this is supported by the recent calculations of van schilfgaarde and mryasov based on local density functional theory.@xcite these calculations predict that due to the strong attractive coupling between the mn ions and the semiconductor cation nuclei , there is a large driving force for the formation of mn clusters consisting of two or more mn atoms located at nearest - neighbor cation sites .",
    "these atomic clusters in turn can stabilize the ferromagnetic state ; according to this model , the presence of free carriers is not required .",
    "although the model does not consider kinetic effects , which may determine whether mn clustering occurs , the growth temperature used for our films is likely sufficient to overcome any kinetic barrier to cluster formation .",
    "indeed clustering of the transition - metal ion has been observed in other iii - v dmss grown at high temperatures@xcite and may also occur in other materials that have been shown to exhibit ferromagnetic behavior while having @xmath63-type conductivity.@xcite presently , we are pursuing extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) measurements of these films to determine the local environment of mn .",
    "in conclusion , epitaxial , single - phase in@xmath11mn@xmath12as films have been grown using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy at temperatures as high as 520 @xmath4c .",
    "temperature- and field - dependent magnetization measurements indicated a single - phase film ( as measured by x - ray diffraction ) to be ferromagnetic with a curie temperature of 333 k. modelling of the magnetization data indicated that the ferromagnetic - to - paramagnetic phase transition was intermediate between first and second order .",
    "the origin of the observed ferromagnetism was discussed in the light of a new theory based on the formation of transition - metal clusters .",
    "extensive use was made of the materials research center facilities at northwestern university .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation through the mrsec program under grant number dmr-0076097 ."
