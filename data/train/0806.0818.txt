    "although much effort has been made in trying to predict low energy hadron observables directly from qcd , one is still far from reaching this goal due to the extremely complex non - perturbative behavior of the theory in that regime . in such a situation",
    "it proves convenient to turn to the study of effective models . for two light flavors",
    "it is believed that qcd supports an approximate su(2 ) chiral symmetry which is dynamically broken at low energies , and pions play the role of the corresponding goldstone bosons .",
    "a simple scheme including these properties is the well known nambu@xmath3jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , proposed more than four decades ago .",
    "the njl model has been widely used as an schematic effective theory for qcd  @xcite , allowing e.g.  the description of light mesons as fermion - antifermion composite states . in the njl model quarks",
    "interact through a local , chiral invariant four - fermion coupling . because of the local nature of this interaction ,",
    "the corresponding schwinger - dyson and bethe - salpeter equations become relatively simplified . however , the main drawbacks of the model are direct consequences of this locality : loop integrals are divergent ( and therefore have to be regulated somehow ) , and the model is nonconfining . as a way to improve upon the njl model , extensions which include nonlocal interactions have been proposed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , nonlocality arises naturally in quantum field theory and , particularly , in several well established approaches to low energy quark dynamics , as e.g.  the instanton liquid model  @xcite and the schwinger - dyson resummation techniques  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations  @xcite also indicate that quark interactions should act over a certain range in the momentum space .",
    "moreover , it has been argued that nonlocal extensions of the njl model do not show some of the above mentioned inconveniences of the local theory .",
    "indeed , nonlocal interactions regularize the model in such a way that anomalies are preserved  @xcite and charges are properly quantized , the effective interaction is finite to all orders in the loop expansion and therefore there is not need to introduce extra cutoffs  @xcite , soft regulators such as gaussian functions lead to small next - to - leading order corrections  @xcite , etc .    in the present work we will reconsider non - local models adopting as the basic ingredient a reliable description of the quark propagator as given from fundamental studies , such as lattice qcd . in this sense",
    ", it should be noticed that , except for ref.@xcite , most of the calculation performed so far using non - local chiral quark models have neglected the wave function renormalization in the propagator ( see e.g. refs .",
    "recent lattice qcd calculations suggest , however , that such renomalization can be of the order of 30 % ( or even more ) at zero momentum@xcite .",
    "moreover , these calculations also show that the quark masses tend to their asymptotic values in a rather soft way .",
    "thus , it is of importance to perform a detailed study on the incorporation of these features in this type of models , and analyze their role in the prediction for different hadronic observables .",
    "the lagrangian we will use is the minimal extension which allows to incorporate the full momentum dependence of the quark propagator , through its mass and wave function renormalization . using this lagrangian",
    "we explore which are the implications for some pion and sigma meson properties originated by changes in the quark propagator . in particular",
    ", we present here results for the sigma meson mass and width , and for the pion - pion scattering parameters . studying these scattering parameters close to the chiral limit we are also able to obtain predictions for some of the low energy constants of the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4pt ) lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model lagrangian and the formalism necessary to derive some selected pion and sigma meson properties . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss different ways to obtain the model parameters and compare the resulting quark propagators with available lattice data . in sec .",
    "iv we present and discuss the predictions of the model for the selected parametrizations , paying special attention to the role played by the incorporation of the wavefunction renormalization and by the difference in the quark interaction momentum dependence . in sec .",
    "v we analyze the connection of the non - local quark models described here with @xmath4pt , and present the predictions for the corresponding low energy constants relevant for @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering to @xmath2 in the chiral expansion . finally , in sec . vi our main conclusions are summarized .",

    "the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eq.([cuoge ] ) , are nonlocal covariant form factors characterizing the corresponding interactions .",
    "the four standard quark currents , @xmath15 , require the same @xmath13 form factor to guarantee chiral invariance . the new term , @xmath16 is self - invariant under chiral transformations .",
    "the scalar - isoscalar component of the @xmath15 current will generate the momentum dependent quark mass in the quark propagator , while the  \" momentum  \"",
    "current , @xmath17 will be responsible for a momentum dependent wave function renormalization of this propagator . for convenience ,",
    "we take the same coupling parameter , @xmath18 for the standard chiral quark interaction and for the new @xmath19 term .",
    "note , however , that the relative strength between both interaction terms will be controlled by the mass parameter @xmath20 introduced in eq.([cuoge ] ) .",
    "we have choosen the relative sign between these terms in order to have a real value for @xmath20 for the case in which the wave function renormalization @xmath21 ( explicitly defined in eq.([propa ] below ) is less than 1 . in what follows it",
    "is convenient to fourier transform @xmath13 and @xmath14 into momentum space .",

    "are much less sensitive to the choice of lattice parameters , and in fact the two lattice groups @xcite provide similar results .",
    "we observe that the functions @xmath128 and @xmath21 for scenario s1 , based on exponential functions , decrease faster than the lattice data . for scenario s2 , however , they go to zero as @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively , following the lattice data in a closer manner .",

    "in this section we present and discuss our numerical results . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we give the results for the mean - field properties , together with the pion and sigma masses and decay parameters . as it can be seen in this table ,",
    "while for the exponential parameterizations ( i.e. s1 and s3 ) the empirical values of @xmath69 and @xmath136 are consistent with a quark condensate which lies within the range of the usually quoted phenomenological values @xmath150 - @xmath151  mev  @xcite the scenario s2 leads to a value of the chiral condensate somewhat above such range . on the other hand , the corresponding current quark mass is quite smaller than those obtained for the scenarios s1 and s3 .",
    "this issue deserves some comment .",
    "the chiral condensate , as well as the current quark masses , are scale dependent objects .",
    "in particular , the phenomenological values quoted above for the condensate correspond to a choice of the renormalization scale @xmath152  gev . in the parametrization s2 some parameters",
    "have been determined so as to obtain a good approximation to the lattice mass renormalization function @xmath143 , a quantity which also depends on the renormalization point .",
    "in particular , we use the function @xmath143 obtained in ref.@xcite where the renormalization scale has been chosen to be @xmath153 gev",
    ". one might wonder whether the fact that this renormalization point differs from the one usually used to quote the values of the condensate can account for the fact that the s2 prediction is outside the empirical range .",
    "if one assumes that this difference is also responsible for the rather low value of @xmath6 this can be investigated in the following way . to leading order in the chiral expansion the current quark mass and the condensate",
    "are related by the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gmor ) relation @xmath154 where @xmath155 .",
    "the validity of gmor to that order is well justified by the low energy behavior of the @xmath156 scattering amplitudes @xcite . using that , according to ref.@xcite , @xmath157 runs from   5.5 mev at the scale @xmath152 gev to 4.1 mev at @xmath158 gev we expect that a typical value of @xmath159  mev at @xmath152 gev will run to @xmath160  mev at @xmath158 gev @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations provide an independent determination of quark masses and @xmath161 condensate @xcite : @xmath162 which confirms the @xmath158 gev values given above .",
    "note that since these two lattice calculations are not connected , the quoted values imply a verification of the gmor relation .",
    "since the gmor relation is well satisfied by our lagrangian model @xcite , and in all our scenarios @xmath69 and @xmath136 are fitted to their empirical values , it is clear that the quality of the description of the quark condensate and the current quark mass are closely related .",
    "thus , a further running up to @xmath163 implies that the current quark mass must be scaled by a factor of the @xmath164 .",
    "this value is rather different from the factor 1.81 obtained from the ratio between the lattice result at @xmath158 gev and the value of @xmath6 for the scenario s2 given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "this clearly indicates that possible ambiguities related to the choice of renormalization point can not fully account for the rather high value of the condensate for the scenario s2 .",
    "in fact , using the above mentioned factors to reescale the value @xmath165  mev quoted in table [ tab1 ] down to @xmath166 we get @xmath167  mev which is about @xmath168 above the empirical upper limit . a possible way to reduce the value of the quark condensate in s2 is to reduce the parameter @xmath117 . for @xmath169 mev",
    "we can obtain values for the quark condensate and quark masses which are within the phenomenological bounds .",
    "the mass and width of the sigma meson display some dependence on the parametrization . however , such dependence is smaller than the one found in the local njl model@xcite .",
    "the obtained values for the masses are somewhat larger than the recently extracted empirical values @xmath170 @xcite and @xmath171 @xcite while the widths are compatible with the experimentally reported values @xmath172 @xcite and @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "the situation concerning the @xmath44 meson deserves some comment . in general , for the non - local models under consideration the quark propagators develop a series of poles in the complex plane . in euclidean space ,",
    "such poles can be purely imaginary ( as in the njl model which only has one pole of this type ) or fully complex .",
    "the existence of these poles implies the appearance of  \" pinch points ",
    "\" @xcite in the calculation of the meson two - point functions .",
    "the external momentum for which the first of such  \" pinch points  \" appears is given by @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the imaginary part of the first pole of the quark propagator . from this point on the functions @xmath176 in eq.(17 ) do in general develop an imaginary component related to the unphysical decay into @xmath177 pairs , which is usually associated with the lack of confinement . in some cases , depending on the regulator and/or parametrization , one can find a prescription for the integration path along the complex plane such that this imaginary component cancels out@xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that the corresponding results turn out to be prescription dependent and , unless the meson pole appears no far above @xmath178 , not very reliable .",
    "for this reason , in this work we take the point of view that @xmath178 marks the limit of validity of our model . for the three scenarios under consideration we have found @xmath178 to be about 1 gev , which appears to be a reasonable scale for a low energy effective model of qcd . as for the @xmath44 channel",
    "we have verified that no pole corresponding to a meson of this type appears below that scale .",
    "we turn now to the low - energy parameters for @xmath179 scattering .",
    "these parameters have been matter of much attention in the recent past years .",
    "in particular , recent results on kl4 decays @xcite have led to an improved phenomenological determination@xcite of the threshold parameters for s- , p- , d- and f- waves .",
    "our results for the s and p waves are displayed in table [ tab2 ] while those corresponding to d and f waves in table [ tab3 ] . since the calculation of sigma pole contributions include off - shell quantities it is not possible to perform a clear and unique separation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 contributions .",
    "thus , only the sum of such contributions is given .",
    "in general , reasonable estimates indicate that @xmath44 contributions represent only a few percent of this total value .",
    "the phenomenological values extracted in ref.@xcite are also indicated . in comparing our results with these values one should keep in mind that the present model does not incorporate pion loops , and hence there is still room for improvement .",
    "finally , for comparison , in tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] the existing results for the local su(2 ) njl model @xcite are given .",
    "results obtained in alternative qcd - based quark models can be found , e.g. in ref.@xcite    we analyze first the results corresponding to the s- and p - waves .",
    "let us recall that to leading order in the chiral expansion the corresponding length and slope parameters can be obtained from the weinberg amplitude @xmath180 which leads to the predictions @xmath181 since our three different scenarios lead to the same values of @xmath69 and @xmath136 the predictions for these five scattering parameters are expected to be quite similar .",
    "in fact , results in table [ tab2 ] confirm this , although those of s2 are in slightly better agreement with empirical data .",
    "this is particularly interesting in the case of @xmath182 , which results from a rather strong cancellation between box and sigma contributions . in order to be more sensitive in the comparison between scenarios",
    ", we also give in table [ tab2 ] the combination of the s - wave isospin 0 and 2 parameters @xmath183 which vanishes in the chiral limit .",
    "we observe that in all scenarios the correction goes in the right direction .",
    "moreover , in the case of s2 its magnitude is larger providing therefore a better description of the experimental result .",
    "another way to improve on the discrimination between the different parametrizations of our model is to consider corrections up to @xmath184 order in the expansion eq.([texp ] ) .",
    "thus , we calculate the parameters @xmath185 and @xmath186 corresponding to the @xmath187 and @xmath184 corrections , respectively .",
    "we observe that in each partial wave the exponential interaction produces scattering parameters which decrease rather fast with the power of @xmath110 . on the other hand , the scenario s2 predicts coefficients which are of the same order of magnitude in each partial wave .",
    "we consider now the scattering lengths and slope parameters for d- and f - waves displayed in table [ tab3 ] . these results , together with the scattering lengths and slope parameters of s- and p - waves given in table [ tab2 ] , complete all cases for which there are phenomenological determinations available . for s1 and s3",
    ", we observe that the signs of the parameters are correctly predicted , except for @xmath188 in s3 .",
    "the absolute values for the scattering lengths are off by a factor between 1.5 and 2.5 , whereas the slope parameters fail by one order of magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the scenario s2 gives the right sign and order of magnitude in all cases , deviating only by a factor 3 in the worse case , @xmath189 .",
    "from the previous results we can conclude that although the exponential interaction might be able to reproduce the scattering lengths parameters rather well the description of higher power coefficients is , in general , expected to be less accurate as the power in @xmath110 increases .",
    "this is particularly so for the higher partial waves .",
    "on the other hand , the momentum dependence of the scenario s2 seems to be better adapted for the description of the higher power parameters .",
    "in fact , the only case where this scenario gives a worse result than the exponential ones is in the prediction for @xmath190 , where a strong cancellation between the box and sigma contribution takes place .    comparing scenarios s1 and s3 we can observe the effect on the scattering parameters of taking into account the wave function renormalization . except for the parameters listed in eq.([scatlengthchiral ] ) , we observe that as the power in @xmath110 increases the associated parameters obtained in scenario s3 decrease faster than in scenario s1 .",
    "we can conclude that the effect of the wave function renormalization term goes in the right direction , even if this effect is less important than the one produced by the difference in the momentum dependence of the interactions .",
    "it should be noticed that our scenario s3 is very similar to the model used in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , in both cases the wave function renormalization is not included , exponential parameterizations are used and the values of @xmath136 and @xmath69 are fitted .",
    "the difference comes from the way in which the third parameter of the model is determined . in ref.@xcite",
    "the rather sensitive value of @xmath191 was used , while here we choose to fix the chiral condensate .    in our scenarios which include wavefunction renormalization we have fixed @xmath125 . as it can be seen in fig.[fig1",
    "] , however , for small values of @xmath192 the errors in the lattice results are rather large .",
    "thus , @xmath193 is not well constrained by lattice calculations . in order to test the sensitivity of our results to this kind of uncertainties",
    "we have reduced it to @xmath194 , and considered the scenario s2 for two alternative situations . in the first case we varied the model parameters so that @xmath69 and @xmath136 remain at their empirical values , while in the second case we kept the model parameters fixed . in both cases we found that most of our results change by less that 10% , the most notorious exception being the @xmath156 scattering length @xmath191 which changes about 15 % .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the second case the pion mass and decay constant , as well as the chiral condensate , get reduced .",
    "we obtain @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "in the previous section we have focused our attention on the ability of our quark model to reproduce the phenomenological @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering parameters .",
    "an alternative point of view ( see , for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) is to consider the quark models as the generators of the pion chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4pt ) lagrangian@xcite .",
    "@xmath4pt describes the low energy physics of pions in a universal way , once the order in the momentum and chiral breaking expansion ( i.e. the order in the chiral expansion ) is specified . different scenarios for quark models will lead to @xmath4pt lagrangians with different values of the so - called low energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "in this section we analyze the connection between our quark scenarios and the @xmath4pt lagrangian up to the fourth order in the chiral expansion .    to perform this connection we introduce the pionic lagrangian @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200{rr}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right )   \\ \\ \\ . \\label{massmatrix}\\ ] ] note that among all possible @xmath2 terms only those relevant for @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering to that order have been explicitly given . to the order we are working ,",

    "in fact , we have verified that close to the chiral limit the scattering parameters display , as a function of @xmath206 , the quadratic behavior expected from eqs.([paramscattchptequivalente ] ) . from the determination of the corresponding linear and quadratic coefficients it is possible to obtain the numerical values of lecs @xmath204 .",
    "it should be noticed that this procedure for obtaining @xmath204 is completely equivalent to the bosonization of the quark lagrangian followed by a covariant gradient expansion ( see ref.@xcite for the application of such method to the njl model ) . at this stage",
    "we are connecting our quark model at the one loop level to the pionic lagrangian at the tree level .",
    "our next step is to make the connection with the @xmath4pt lagrangian .",
    "the main difference between the lagrangian ( [ chiralexpansion ] ) and the @xmath4pt lagrangian is that our @xmath204 parameters are finite and no pion loop contribution is present .",
    "the scattering parameters in @xmath4pt @xcite include pion loop contributions , and are written in terms of renormalized lecs @xmath207 .",
    "as expected , eqs.([paramscattchptequivalente ] ) coincide with the ones obtained from @xmath4pt if the corresponding pion loop contributions are neglected . in this approximation",
    "the coupling constants @xmath204 can be identified with the @xmath207 constants at some given renormalization scale @xmath208 .",
    "eqs.([paramscattchptequivalente ] ) imply several relations between the scattering parameters .",
    "we focus on two of them @xmath209{cc}0 & \\text { \\ \\ using ( \\ref{paramscattchptequivalente})}\\\\ \\frac{m_{\\pi}^{4}}{16\\pi^{4}f_{\\pi}^{4}}\\frac{17\\pi}{12 } & \\text{\\ \\ using } \\chi\\text{pt}\\end{array } \\right .",

    "therefore , a non - vanishing value obtained for these two quantities in any other calculation must be originated by loop corrections or by higher order terms in the chiral expansion .",
    "as indicated in eqs.([test1],[test2 ] ) , in the case of the @xmath4pt lagrangian both relations have corrections from pionic loops . on the other hand ,",
    "the deviation from zero of @xmath211 and @xmath212 when evaluated using the scattering parameters obtained in our quark scenarios at the physical value of @xmath136 is originated by higher order terms in the chiral expansion . in table",
    "[ tabletest ] we show the results for these two relations in our scenarios .",
    "also indicated are the @xmath4pt lagrangian results , which corresponds to the pion loop contribution of the order @xmath213 . from this table",
    "we observe that the quark scenarios previously studied give results for @xmath211 and @xmath212 which are of the same order of magnitude than the pion loop contributions .",
    "this implies that the studied quark models include higher order contributions ( i.e. o(6 ) or higher ) which are as important as the chiral loops .",
    "the effect of these higher order contributions is more important for the scenario s2 , due to its different behavior for large momenta .    in table",
    "v we give the @xmath204 values corresponding to our different scenarios .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of @xmath214 the listed values result , in all cases , from an important cancellation between the box and the sigma contributions . for @xmath215",
    "only box contribution is present since no scalar meson contribution is possible @xcite .",
    "also given in table v are the values of the renormalized lecs @xmath216 obtained@xcite in the framework of @xmath4pt at some particular values of renormalization scale @xmath208@xcite .",
    "we observe that the sign and order of magnitude of the most accurately known lecs @xmath217 and @xmath218 are well reproduced for small values of @xmath208 .",
    "in fact , in the case of the scenarios s1 and s2 the agreement is remarkable good for @xmath208 around @xmath219 which is a reasonable scale since we have integrated out degrees of freedom from below the sigma mass . in the case of the lecs @xmath220 and @xmath221 , even though it is not so good in the case of s2 , the agreement is still acceptable given the existing uncertainties in the determination of the empirical values . finally , as a reference",
    ", some typical values obtained within the local njl model taken from ref.@xcite are also listed in table v.",
    "in this work we have analyzed the sigma meson mass and width together with the @xmath1-@xmath1 scattering parameters in the context of non - local chiral quark models with wave - function renormalization ( wfr ) term .",
    "we have considered two types of momentum dependence for the quark interactions . the first one ( scenario s1 ) is based on the frequently used exponential form factors .",
    "the second one ( scenario s2 ) corresponds to a fit to the mass and renormalization functions obtained in lattice calculations@xcite , and gives rise to a softer momentum dependence ( e.g. at large momentum , the quark mass decreases as @xmath147 instead of exponentially ) . in order to test the influence of the wfr",
    ", we also considered a third scenario s3 which corresponds to an exponential interaction but where this renormalization is absent .",
    "our results for the sigma mass are relatively stable , ranging from 552 mev for s2 to 683 mev for s3 .",
    "we observe that the coupling between the scalar term of the standard chiral interaction and the new scalar term associated with the wfr term reduces the value of the lower sigma mass , as it must be expected . comparing the s3 and s1 results we observe a reduction of a 10% , while in the case of the s2 interaction there is a further reduction of 10% originated by the softer momentum dependence of the interaction .",
    "the width of the sigma follows the same reduction as its mass , as one goes from one scenario to another .",
    "these results are less dependent on the parameterization than in the standard njl model .",
    "the predicted mass and width are reasonable close to the recently reported empirical values @xcite .    regarding the @xmath179 scattering parameters ,",
    "we have compared our results with the phenomenological determination made in ref.@xcite .",
    "although the existence of the chiral limit relations , eqs.([scatlengthchiral ] ) , for the s- and p - wave scattering length and slope parameters reduces the sensitivity of these parameters to the choice of the different quark interactions , we have been able to discriminate between these interactions by going to higher order in the momentum expansion or to higher partial waves .",
    "we conclude that although the exponential interaction is able to reproduce the scattering lengths parameters rather well the description of higher power coefficients turns out to be , in general , less accurate as the power in @xmath110 increases .",
    "this can be clearly seen in the case of higher partial waves . on the other hand",
    ", the momentum dependence of the scenario s2 seems to be better adapted for the description of the existing empirical data . comparing the predictions of the scenarios based on exponential interactions , s1 and s3",
    ", we observe that the presence of the wfr term tends to improve the results , even though its effect is less noticeable that the one produced by the difference on the momentum dependence of the interactions .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the relation of our quark scenarios with the chiral lagrangian up to @xmath2 in the chiral expansion .",
    "in particular , we have obtained predictions for the low energy constants @xmath204 involved in @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering within our scenarios .",
    "the procedure we followed , using the scattering parameters , is equivalent to the standard method of bosonization followed by covariant gradient expansion .",
    "our predicted values for @xmath204 are in relative good agreement with the values for the renormalized @xmath222 constants defined in the @xmath4pt calculations @xcite for a @xmath208 value about @xmath223 .",
    "they are also in the range of values obtained in the njl model calculation of ref .",
    "we have been able to define combinations of the scattering parameters which allow to discriminate between higher chiral corrections ( o(6 ) or higher ) and pion loop corrections .",
    "we observe that the higher order corrections included in our non - local quark model calculations at physical @xmath136 are of the same order that the pion loop corrections not considered in this work .",
