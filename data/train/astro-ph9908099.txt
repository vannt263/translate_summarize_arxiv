    "galaxy interactions are likely to play a key role in determining the morphology and the structural properties of galaxies and in driving evolution at all epochs and in widely - varying environments .",
    "the importance of environmental conditions on the properties of populations of galaxies has been recognized for a long time ( hubble & humason 1931 ) and observational studies have now firmly established relationships between the relative abundance of galaxies of different morphological types and the density of the environment ( see e.g. dressler 1980 , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , their location in clusters ( oemler 1974 ) as well as the evolution of the morphology of galaxies in clusters at different epochs ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ) .",
    "in particular , the ratio of early to late - type galaxies has been shown to be an increasing function of density and a decreasing function of the distance from the center of a cluster .",
    "in addition , hst observations show that the relative number of spirals to elliptical and s0 galaxies tend to increase in distant clusters , pointing to a time evolution of the morphology of galaxies from spirals to ellipticals ( see e.g. dressler et al .",
    "1994a , 1994b , couch et al .",
    "1998 ) . altogether , these results suggest that environmental disturbances due to interactions with other galaxies and with a cluster tidal field can lead to dramatic changes in the structure of galaxies .",
    "simulations have explored strong encounters and mergers .",
    "our recent work suggests that relatively weak encounters can give rise to significant asymmetries as well . to study weaker galaxy interactions and quantify their importance",
    ", we compute the response of a spherical stellar system to the perturbation induced by another system during a fly - by , focusing our attention on the morphology and the persistence of the distortions produced during the encounter .",
    "the range of orbital parameters considered encompasses the typical environmental conditions for field galaxies , for galaxies in groups and in clusters .",
    "our perturbative solution for these distortions provides quantitative and qualitative predictions in low to moderate amplitude that are difficult to reach by simulation .",
    "this approach nicely reveals the underlying dynamics without being masked or swamped by n - body fluctuation noise . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical feasibility restricts the complexity of possible geometries and the perturbative assumption limits its validity for large amplitudes .",
    "our investigation is relevant for galactic dark halos or for spheroidal galaxies over a range of environments .",
    "we explore the possibility that the halo distortions produced during a fly - by could in turn lead to a significant and observable distortion in an embedded stellar disk ( see e.g. weinberg 1995 , 1998b , murali & tremaine 1998 , murali 1998 ) . in particular the deformations produced in a dark halo during an encounter could be one of the culprits for distorted morphologies like those observed in lopsided and warped galactic disks ( see e.g. richter & sancisi 1994 , zaritsky & rix 1997 , rudnick & rix 1998 , swaters et al .",
    "1998 , haynes et al .",
    "1998 , kornreich , haynes & lovelace 1998 ) .",
    "as recently shown by weinberg ( 1995 , 1998b ) , this could be the case for the milky way in which the deformations induced in the dark halo by the magellanic clouds could be responsible for the observed warp in the galactic disk .",
    "in a recent investigation , reshetnikov & combes ( 1998 , 1999 ) have found that about 40% of a sample of 540 galaxies have warped planes and their analysis revealed that warped galaxies tend to be located in denser environments supporting a scenario in which interactions would play an important role in the formation of warps .",
    "distortions of spheroidal galaxies are directly observable .",
    "our results show that in low velocity dispersion and dense environments , where low - velocity close encounters are more likely to occur , even low - mass perturbers can lead to significant asymmetries in the primary galaxy .",
    "recent morphological studies of both local and very distant galaxies have yielded comparisons of the frequencies of systems with distorted morphologies in different environments and at different distances ( see e.g. zepf & whitmore 1993 , mendes de oliveira & hickson 1994 , abraham et al . 1996a,1996b , van den bergh et al .",

    "1998 , marleau & simard 1998 , conselice & bershady 1998 , conselice & gallagher 1999 ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the efforts have been largely concentrated on numerical @xmath2-body simulations aimed at investigating the fate and the evolution of merging galaxies ( see e.g. barnes & hernquist 1992 , barnes 1998 and references therein ) and the distortions and the morphological alterations produced in galaxies in clusters and groups by the ensemble of `` tidal shocks '' with other members ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "this mechanism can drive the evolution of spiral galaxies into spheroidal systems and it is a strong candidate explanation for the difference in the relative number of spiral to elliptical galaxies in clusters at different redshifts .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in ",
    "2 we outline the method adopted for this investigation while the mathematical details are described in the appendix . in ",
    "3 we show the results obtained for initial conditions typical of galactic dark halos and their dependence on the orbital parameters of the perturber . in  4 initial conditions relevant for spheroidal galaxies and a survey of orbital parameters of the perturber typical of different environments are considered .",
    "overall , our results quantify the relationship between the interaction rate for the environment and the probability of observing irregular morphologies , aiding interpretation of any trend in the fraction of asymmetric galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "this latter aspect is of particular interest as data on the morphology of distant galaxies are now available from hst observations in the hubble deep field and in the medium deep survey projects ( abraham et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) . in order to facilitate the comparison of our theoretical results with observational data",
    ", we will quantify the distortions produced by means of the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 ( abraham et al .",
    "1996a ) which has been determined for a number of local and distant galaxies .",
    "we will also introduce a generalized asymmetry parameter @xmath1 which will provide an important information on the radial structure of the asymmetry produced by the mechanism we have considered and which will allow to test the theory presented here .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized and discussed in  5 .",
    "this section outlines the perturbative solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation used to predict the dynamical response of galaxies to interactions .",
    "additional mathematical detail is presented in the appendix .",
    "the linear perturbation theory used here has been applied in the past both to investigate the collisionless stability of stellar disks ( kalnajs 1977 ) and of spherical stellar systems ( polyachenko & shukhman 1981 , palmer & papaloizou 1987 , bertin & pegoraro 1989 , saha 1991 , weinberg 1991 , bertin et al .",
    "1994 ; see also palmer 1994 and references therein ) and to study the response of a galaxy to perturbations induced by satellite companions ( weinberg 1989 , 1995 , 1998b ) .",
    "this method is numerically intensive but it avoids the problems of n - body simulations due to the finite number of particles which can introduce spurious noise effects ( see weinberg 1998a ) and it guarantees the resolution of resonances that lead to the excitation of patterns in the primary system . with too few particles ,",
    "for example , noise can cause orbital energies and angular momenta to drift on a time scale shorter than the pattern speed of the global response of interest .",
    "this eliminates the possibility of observing this structure in the simulation .",
    "no doubt , real galaxies are not smooth and inherent fluctuations may be important to their evolution .",
    "however , many millions of n - body particles are required to approach the estimates of natural amplitudes ( nelson & tremaine 1996 , weinberg 1998a ) .",
    "we compute the perturbation induced on a spherical stellar system by a point mass perturber with mass @xmath3 on a rectilinear trajectory with pericenter @xmath4 .",
    "the response of the primary system will be determined by the simultaneous solution of the linearized collisionless boltzmann and poisson s equations , + f_1 h_0- f_0 h_1=0 [ veq ] , ^2 _ 1=4g_1 , where the subscript @xmath5 denotes the equilibrium quantities , subscript @xmath6 denotes the first order perturbation of the distribution function @xmath7 , the hamiltonian @xmath8 , and the potential @xmath9 .",
    "the boltzmann equation has been written in terms of action - angle variables @xmath10 .",
    "the perturbed potential , @xmath11 , is the sum of the tidal potential due to the perturber , @xmath12 , and the gravitational potential of the response to the perturbation , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the coupled boltzmann - poisson equations lead to an integrodifferential equation for the potential .",
    "this can be solved by performing a fourier transform in the angle variables , a laplace transform in the time variable and expanding the perturbed quantities in terms of spherical harmonics and of a bi - orthogonal density - potential basis functions for the angular and the radial parts respectively .",
    "the integrodifferential equation is then reduced to an algebraic equation for the vector of coefficients of the expansion of the response potential and density , * a * , = * r*(*a*+*b * ) [ mateq ] .",
    "the matrix * r * contains the time dependence of the perturbation and the equilibrium properties of the perturbed system and * b * is the vector of the coefficients of the expansion of the external perturbing potential .",
    "it is clear from equation ( [ mateq ] ) that the self - consistent response of the perturbed system is determined both by the perturbation applied by the external perturber and by the reaction of the system to its own response to this perturbation . in general ,",
    "an additional contribution to the total response comes from excitation of the discrete damped modes of the primary system besides the effects of the perturber and the self - gravity of the distorted primary .",
    "the differences in the mathematical structure of these two contributions are illustrated in the appendix .",
    "the transient response due to the discrete damped modes can have a strong effect on the amplitude of the response ( cf .",
    " 3 ) and it is particularly important when the modes are weakly damped with damping timescales longer than the fly - by timescale . in this case , the discrete damped modes produce long - lived features which completely determine the amplitude and the structure of the response long after the pericenter passage of the perturber . once the above algebraic equation has been solved , the calculation of response potential and density is straightforward @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath16\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the bi - orthogonal density - potential basis function and @xmath19 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "features excited in the halo can give rise to visible distortions in an embedded disk even though dark halo perturbations are not directly observable .",
    "while several other processes could be responsible for the observed distorted morphologies of stellar disks ( see e.g. sellwood & merritt 1994 , levine & sparke 1998 , bertin & mark 1980 , nelson & tremaine 1995 ) , the role played by a distorted galactic dark halo in exciting peculiar features in disks has been advanced for the case of an interaction of a galaxy with a satellite companion by weinberg ( 1995,1998b ) and applied to the case of the milky way - magellanic cloud system .",
    "halo deformations leading to morphological and kinematical lopsidedness has been invoked by swaters et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in an analysis of two kinematically lopsided spiral galaxies ( ddo 9 , ngc 4395 ) . the ubiquity of magellanic - class dwarf companions of normal spirals ( e.g. zaritsky & white 1994 and zaritsky et al .",
    "1997 ) suggests that such interactions may be important sources of structure .",
    "unbound encounters can have similar effect as we will illustrate here .",
    "our standard dark halo model is an isotropic king model with a dimensionless central potential @xmath20 ( concentration , to core radius , @xmath21 @xmath22 ) a total mass @xmath23 and a total radius @xmath24 kpc .",
    "these values are appropriate for the galactic halo ( see e.g. kochanek 1996 ) and together with a standard exponential disk results in a fair fit to the observed rotation curve . given the primary model , the perturber s velocity @xmath25 and pericenter @xmath4 determine the structure of the response to the perturbation .",

    "the inclusion of the damped modes leads to a much longer and stronger dipole response , while producing no significant difference in the quadrupole response .",
    "such long - lived features may explain the numerous cases of galaxies with distorted morphologies but without any apparent interacting system in their vicinities ( e.g. richter & sancisi 1994 ) .",
    "for example , for a system with mass and radius equal to those of our fiducial system ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 kpc ) , the damping time of the dipole mode ( @xmath52 yrs ) is longer the hubble time and any perturbation excited in a dark halo during a fly - by as well as its effect on an embedded disk will persist well after the encounter .",

    "a lag between the orientation of the wake and the position angle of the perturber is evident for all velocities .",
    "this lag is a consequence of angular momentum transfer between the wake and the perturber and tends to zero only when there is no resonance affecting the response of the primary system .",
    "physically , resonant momentum exchange viewed at the orbit level has a corresponding view as a global response : the global response must lag the perturber in order to apply the torque responsible for the exchange .",

    "the position of the peak of the density is similar to that obtained in the case without the weakly damped modes but there are evident differences in the time evolution of @xmath54 particularly at the beginning and at the end of the fly - by due to the persistence of the damped modes .",

    "plots shown in figure 10 are for the same cases and phases shown in figure 6 and figure 7 .",

    "we found that @xmath93 is roughly constant for all the fly - bys investigated .",
    "this agrees with the results obtained by weinberg ( 1994 ) in his analysis of the structure of weakly damped modes in isotropic king models .",
    "this implies that more concentrated models are more efficient in transmitting to the inner regions the perturbation excited during a fly - by ( compare fig.8 with fig.15 ) .",
    "figure 16 shows the density distortions for a fly - by with @xmath53 and @xmath47 at three different phases of the orbit of the perturber . as in previous cases ,",
    "the maximum response occurs well inside the primary system and the perturbation is efficiently transmitted to the inner regions of the system far inside the orbital pericenter .",
    "figure 17 shows plots of @xmath94 for the same case and phases shown in figure 16 describing the distribution of energy at different scales .",
    "similar to the results in  3 , the dipole response is dominated by large scale features while in the quadrupole response there is a non negligible contribution to the total energy of the perturbation from features at smaller scales .",
    "we employ an established asymmetry diagnostic to compare our predictions to observations and suggest a straightforward generalization which will help discriminate the response mechanism considered here from others .",
    "we will focus our attention on an asymmetry parameter @xmath0 for image data , defined as a [ asym ] where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the brightness at a given point @xmath97 of the original image and in the image after a 180 degree rotation about the position of the maximum density of the primary system , respectively .    for our calculation",
    "we use the density of the system on the orbital plane and thus our theoretical values are not affected by any projection effect and will provide a measure of the real asymmetry of the plane .",
    "observational values , on the other hand , are determined using the projected density and part of the underlying asymmetry of the orbital plane is likely to be washed out . in order to evaluate the effect of using the projected density on the orbital plane instead of the real plane density , we have repeated some of the calculations",
    ": we have found that , for a given value of @xmath98 , the values of @xmath0 obtained using the projected density are smaller than those obtained using the real plane density by a constant factor independent of the perturber orbital parameters and approximately equal to 3.8 ; this implies that , using the projected density , all the values of @xmath0 ( as well as those of the parameter @xmath99 introduced later in this section ) and the numerical parameters in the scaling laws of the amplitude of @xmath0 with the perturber s orbital parameters discussed in this section are not altered but they are produced by a perturber with a mass equal to @xmath100 ( instead of @xmath101 adopted in the rest of this section ) .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter was first introduced by abraham et al .",
    "( 1996a ) to estimate the asymmetry observed in galaxies in the medium deep survey and in the hubble deep field and it has been recently adopted in several investigations on the morphology of galaxies in different environments ( e.g. van den bergh et al .",

    "a comparison of the distribution of values of @xmath0 for a sample of local galaxies , galaxies in the medium deep survey and in the hubble deep field was reported by abraham et al .",
    "( 1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "their results show that the distribution of @xmath0 for galaxies in the hdf is significantly skewed toward larger values of @xmath0 compared to the distribution for galaxies in the mds which in turn is skewed to larger values of @xmath0 relative to the distribution of @xmath0 for a sample of local galaxies .",
    "this trend is likely to be due to the higher interaction and merging rates for distant galaxies in the hdf and the mds . in principle",
    ", a high value of @xmath0 could also result from an asymmetric distribution of star forming regions , however a recent investigation by conselice & bershady ( 1998 ) shows that the colors of many asymmetric objects in the hdf are not blue enough to support this hypothesis .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the displacement , @xmath99 , between the position of the peak of the density of the primary system and the position of its center of mass .",
    "the estimate of @xmath99 is of particular interest since many observations have provided evidence of off - center galactic nuclei and of significant displacement of isophotal centers ( see e.g. miller & smith 1992 for a short overview of several observational analyses ) . in particular , naim et al .",

    "figure 18 shows the time evolution of the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 defined above ( eq . [ asym ] ) .",

    "we have studied the response of a high - concentration spherical stellar system to the perturbation induced by a fly - by .",
    "we represent the outer profiles of cluster ellipticals by a high - concentration king model ; we choose a king profile rather than a core - free model for numerical convenience .",
    "a deformation in the structure of the primary galaxy is directly observable and we explored quantitative measures of the asymmetry produced during the fly - by encounter . in the end , we focussed our attention on the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 , introduced by abraham et al .",

    "1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "extreme values of @xmath0 observed for some galaxies in the hdf field ( @xmath129 ) are probably caused by mergers .",

    ", the distortions may be long - lived ; in some cases the perturber can be quite distant from the primary system and therefore we can expect some non - negligible values of @xmath0 and @xmath99 even without any close companion in the vicinity of the primary .",
    "our results show that the values of @xmath0 and @xmath99 will be determined by both the distribution of relative encounter velocities and the density of the environment . in short ,",
    "richer groups and clusters with lower velocity dispersions will lead to high values of @xmath0 and @xmath99 .",
    "figure 18 shows that disturbances persist until @xmath130 or roughly @xmath131 years after the pericenter passage . in order to provide a quantitative indication of the dependence of the response on the environmental conditions ,",
    "we have calculated the probability that a galaxy has an encounter in the time interval @xmath132 such that @xmath133 assuming that the perturber has a mass @xmath134 ( or @xmath135 if the projected density is used for the calculation of @xmath0 ) . for our fiducial system @xmath136 yrs and @xmath137 ,",
    "the probability @xmath138 of having such an encounter is given by p = np^2(v)vwhere @xmath63 is the galaxy number density of the environment and @xmath139 is the pericenter distance for which @xmath140 during an encounter with velocity @xmath25 .",
    "the function @xmath139 has been determined using the parametrization reported in table 5 for the values of @xmath25 available from our numerical investigation and then fitting these points with a function of the form @xmath141 .",
    "we obtain p(n , v)=10 ^ -3n(^-3 ) ( v(^-1)/200)^1.44 and describe this function in figure 23 .",
    "this quantifies our finding that galaxies in environments characterized by high density and low - velocity dispersion , like compact groups , will be more likely to show signs of past or recent interactions in agreement with the results of a number of investigations ( see e.g. zepf & whitmore 1993 , mendes de oliveira & hickson 1994 ) .",
    "these observational studies argue that the fraction of distorted morphologies in compact groups is larger than the fraction observed in clusters ( which have similar number densities but higher velocity dispersions ) and in sample of field galaxies ( which are likely to suffer low - velocity encounters but in a low - density environment ) . assuming that young galaxies were located in dense environments and characterized by lower , previrialized velocity dispersions , our conclusions are consistent with the results of abraham et al .",
    "( 1996b ) who have shown that the distribution of @xmath0 for galaxies in the hdf is skewed toward high values compared to that for galaxies in the mds which , in turn , are more asymmetric than local field galaxies .",
    "an additional useful diagnostic is the ratio of the perturber to the primary masses necessary to produce a given value of @xmath142 .",
    "this is easily obtained from the fits discussed in  4.3 and is given by ( mm)_a=0.1 k_a a ( v ( ) 200)^_a , where the values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 depend on @xmath26 ( cf . table 5 ) .",
    "the four frames in figure 24 show the contour plots of @xmath143 in the plane @xmath144 ( as we discussed at the beginning of this section , if the projected density is used for the calculation of @xmath0 the values of @xmath98 are larger than those reported in fig . 24 by a factor 3.8 ) .",
    "any environment producing low - velocity , close encounters can lead to significant asymmetries ( @xmath145 ) in the primary system even by low - mass perturbers ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "for example , consider a system with a mass and a radius equal to those of our fiducial system ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 kpc ) . an encounter with a perturber with @xmath149 with relative velocity @xmath53 km / s leads to @xmath140 if @xmath47 ( @xmath150 kpc for our fiducial system ) .",
    "low - mass interlopers with pericenters close to the primary center could lead to significant asymmetries in cluster ellipticals as well .",
    "fly - by encounters yield the following signature in our radially - dependent asymmetry parameter , @xmath1 : 1 ) a decrease at small radii , 2 ) a peak around @xmath151 and 3 ) a convergence to a constant value at large radii .",
    "although we have not predicted the signature of @xmath1 for scenarios other than fly - bys , we believe an observational investigation would provide a test of the mechanism proposed here and would be a general probe of asymmetric structure .",
    "the computation of @xmath1 is relatively straightforward with the data already available .",
    "we have explored the structure and the persistence of the features in dark halos and cluster ellipticals excited by an unbound ( or _ fly - by _ ) interaction over a range of different galactic environments .",
    "the main conclusions of our analysis are as follows :    1 .",
    "fly - by encounters which penetrate the outer regions of a galaxy can lead to asymmetric features well inside the half - mass radius .",
    "the distortion of a dark halo may affect its disk ( e.g. weinberg 1998b ) .",
    "2 .   in dark halos",
    "the lowest - order damped modes yield strong features which persist well after the perturber s passage and could account for distorted morphologies in galaxies without obvious close companions .",
    "such damped modes are a natural part of the collisionless response but are difficult to resolve in n - body simulations with modest particle number ( @xmath152 ) due to noise .",
    "the strength of the response depends both on the velocity of the perturber and on the pericenter of its orbit ; low - velocity , close encounters produce the strongest perturbations .",
    "4 .   completely external fly - by encounters will produce a strong response if the perturber is more massive than the primary .",
    "for example such encounters can produce significant effects on spiral galaxies in clusters where they are likely to interact with more massive giant ellipticals and on dwarfs in the vicinity of normal galaxies .",
    "a proposed generalization of the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 ( abraham et al .",
    "1996a ) , provides a diagnostic of the radial structure of the asymmetry and a test of the mechanism explored here in particular .",
    "our predicted range of @xmath0 is similar to that observed for the majority of galaxies in the medium deep survey , in the hubble deep field and for local galaxies .",
    "we quantify the range of high - density , low - velocity dispersion environments expected to produce significant distortions by fly - by encounters .",
    "indeed , compact groups have been shown to have a significant fraction of distorted galaxies .",
    "additional discussion is provided in  3.4 for dark halos and in  4.5 for cluster ellipticals .",
    "future work will explore the properties of the response for cuspy galaxies ; the magnitude of the resonant coupling to the inner galaxy in core - free profiles would nicely complement the present work .",
    "we plan to further investigate the effects of the halo distortions on an embedded stellar and gaseous disk , by extending our current study to explore the response of the disk and to quantify the induced deformations .",
    "this will permit direct comparisons with the observed distortions in the morphology of disks as well as to study possible effects of these distortions on their kinematics .",
    "in particular , the effects of even small deformations in the morphologies of disks could significantly affect their kinematics possibly giving rise to the observed scatter in the tully - fisher relation as suggested by franx & de zeeuw ( 1992 ) .",

    "we define the usual quantities @xmath172 , @xmath173 where @xmath118 and @xmath174 are the radial coordinate inside the stellar system and the distance between the center of the system and the perturber , respectively .    following tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) ,",
    "the radial part of the perturbing potential is expanded in terms of the basis function @xmath175 and each resulting term is expressed in the form @xmath176 as a fourier series in the angle variables @xmath177 .",
    "we finally obtain :      where x_l_2_3^_1=12_-^dw_1u__3^l(r)e^-i[_1w_1+_2(w_2- ) ] and v_l_2_3()=r^l__2_3()y_l_3(/2,0)i^_3-_2 .",
    "the angle @xmath179 is the inclination of the orbital plane to the equatorial plane and @xmath180 are the components of the rotation matrices ( see e.g. edmonds 1960 ) .",

    "the functional form of @xmath185 can be easily derived for any value of @xmath183 and @xmath184 using equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
