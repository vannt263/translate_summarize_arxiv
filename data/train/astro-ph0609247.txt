    "x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies can potentially provide plethora of useful cosmological information .",
    "the cluster - based cosmological tests include cluster number counts based on the temperature function , baryon fraction and x - ray and sz hubble constant measurements .",
    "these cosmological tests provide potentially very powerful constraints on the matter density , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the equation of state of dark energy , @xmath6 . in all of these cosmological tests , the key observational ingredients are the gas mass ( @xmath7 ) , total mass ( @xmath8 ) , gas mass fractions ( @xmath9 ) , and average cluster temperature ( @xmath10 ) . in the era of precision cosmology , it is paramount to achieve accurate measurements of the key cluster parameters , check how they depend on various simplifying assumptions , and control systematics due to our incomplete knowledge of the icm physics .",
    "there are many important simplifying assumptions used in deriving cluster properties from x - ray data .",
    "for example , it is usually assumed that the icm density is a function of radius only and does not have small - scale substructure .",
    "however , substructure in clusters is ubiquitous and this biases the x - ray derived @xmath7 high @xcite .",
    "also , the small - scale clumps are often associated with subhalos and thus have lower temperature . neglecting this",
    "can bias the average spectroscopic temperature of the cluster as a whole @xcite which could potentially lead to biases in constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "cluster total masses are often estimated assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium for the icm .",
    "this may underestimate the true gravitational bound mass if non - thermal pressure support is present . for example , turbulent gas motions can provide about 10%20% of the total pressure support even in relaxed clusters and hence bias the hydrostatic estimate @xcite .",
    "spherical symmetry is another commonly used assumption useful in solving for three - dimensional ( 3d ) physical cluster properties from two - dimensional ( 2d ) observed quantities , but could bias results if clusters are aspherical .",
    "x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ enable us to study properties of the icm with unprecedented detail and accuracy and provide important handles on the icm modeling and associated systematics .",
    "their superb spatial resolution and sensitivity enable accurate x - ray brightness and temperature measurements at a large fraction of the cluster virial radius and also make it simple to detect most of the small - scale x - ray clumps . despite this recent observational progress ,",
    "the biases in the determination of the key cluster properties remain relatively uncertain .",
    "the main obstacle is that because of their unrivaled statistical accuracy , the x - ray results can not be contrasted against any other independent observational techniques . in this study",
    ", we attempt to check the validity of the x - ray analyses , with a specific focus on the analyses of high - resolution _ chandra _ data , by using mock observations of clusters derived from cosmological simulations , for which the true answers are known .",
    "our simulations properly treat both collisionless dynamics of dark matter and stars and gasdynamics and capture a variety of physical phenomena from the nonlinear collapse and merging of dark matter to shock - heating and radiative cooling of gas , star formation , chemical enrichment of the icm by supernova and energy feedback .",
    "these simulations can therefore be used to test observational biases due to incomplete relaxation of gas , the dynamical state of a cluster , substructure , or non - isothermality .",
    "as we show in the forthcoming papers , the current simulations match the observed icm profiles outside cluster cores @xcite and the global gas mass fraction @xcite and are therefore sufficiently realistic for a purpose of the current study .",
    "the mock observations of the simulated clusters are generated by exactly reproducing the response properties of the _ chandra _ telescope .",
    "the analysis of the mock data is identical to that used for _ real chandra _",
    "observations by @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the true and derived cluster properties provides an assessment of any biases introduced by the x - ray analysis .",
    "some of these biases are potentially redshift - dependent ( e.g , those related to higher merger rate or decreased ability to detect small - scale substructures in the x - ray data for high-@xmath11 systems ) . to check for any redshift dependence in such biases we use the simulation outputs at @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "our results indicate that the x - ray analysis provides accurate reconstruction of the 3d properties of the icm .",
    "the strongest biases we find are those in the hydrostatic mass estimates .",
    "they are related to physics explicitly missing from the hydrostatic method ( e.g. , turbulence ) , and not to deficiencies of the x - ray analysis .",
    "[ sec : numdetails ] in this study , we analyze high - resolution cosmological simulations of 16 cluster - sized systems in the flat @xmath14cdm model : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where the hubble constant is defined as @xmath19 , and an @xmath5 is the power spectrum normalization on an @xmath20  mpc scale .",
    "the simulations were done with the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) @xmath21-body@xmath22gasdynamics code @xcite , a eulerian code that uses adaptive refinement in space and time , and ( non - adaptive ) refinement in mass @xcite to reach the high dynamic range required to resolve cores of halos formed in self - consistent cosmological simulations .",
    "the simulations presented here are discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite and we refer the reader to these papers for more details . here",
    "we summarize the main parameters of the simulations .",
    "high - resolution simulations were run using a uniform 128@xmath23 grid and 8 levels of mesh refinement in the computational boxes of @xmath24  mpc for cl101107 and @xmath25  mpc for cl324 ( see table  [ tab : sim ] ) .",
    "these simulations achieve a dynamic range of @xmath26 and a formal peak resolution of @xmath27  kpc and @xmath28  kpc , corresponding to the actual resolution of @xmath29  kpc and @xmath30  kpc for the 120 and @xmath25  mpc boxes , respectively .",
    "only the region of @xmath31  mpc around the cluster was adaptively refined , the rest of the volume was followed on the uniform @xmath32 grid .",
    "the mass resolution , @xmath33 , corresponds to the effective @xmath34 particles in the entire box , or the nyquist wavelength of @xmath35 and @xmath36 comoving mpc for cl101107 and cl324 , respectively , or @xmath37 and @xmath38  mpc in the physical units at the initial redshift of the simulations .",
    "the dark matter particle mass in the region around the cluster was @xmath39 for cl101107 and @xmath40 for cl324 , while other regions were simulated with lower mass resolution .",
    "the @xmath41body@xmath22gasdynamics cluster simulations used in this analysis include collisionless dynamics of dark matter and stars , gasdynamics and several physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation : star formation , metal enrichment and thermal feedback due to supernovae type ii and type ia , self - consistent advection of metals , metallicity dependent radiative cooling and uv heating due to cosmological ionizing background @xcite .",
    "the cooling and heating rates take into account compton heating and cooling of plasma , uv heating , and atomic and molecular cooling , and are tabulated for the temperature range @xmath42  k and a grid of metallicities , and uv intensities using the cloudy code ( ver .",
    "96b4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cloudy cooling and heating rates take into account metallicity of the gas , which is calculated self - consistently in the simulation , so that the local cooling rates depend on the local metallicity of the gas .",
    "star formation in these simulations was done using the observationally - motivated recipe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath43 , with @xmath44  yrs .",
    "the code also accounts for the stellar feedback on the surrounding gas , including injection of energy and heavy elements ( metals ) via stellar winds , supernovae , and secular mass loss .",
    "these simulations therefore follow the formation of galaxy clusters starting from the well - defined cosmological initial conditions and capture the dynamics and properties of the icm in a realistic cosmological context .",
    "however , some potentially relevant physical processes , such as agn bubbles , magnetic field , and cosmic rays , are not included .",
    "therefore , the simulated icm properties are probably not fully realistic in the innermost cluster regions .",
    "moreover , the gas in the simulations is treated as an ideal inviscid fluid with a small amount of numerical viscosity , and it remains unclear to what extent the level of icm turbulence found in the simulations and discussed below applies to real clusters . despite these limitations , the current simulations reproduce the observed icm profiles outside cluster cores @xcite and the global gas mass fraction @xcite and are therefore sufficiently realistic for a purpose of the current study .",

    "we simulate two sets of mock _ chandra _ data .",
    "the first set has an exposure time of 100  ksec ( typical for deep observations ) and includes a background with the intensity corresponding to the quiescent background level in the acis - i observations @xcite . from these data ,",

    "the purpose of this analysis is to reconstruct spherically averaged icm density and temperature profiles , and to estimate total cluster mass assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the entire procedure and justification of the choices made is extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "below , we briefly outline the essential steps .",
    "the main observational input is azimuthally averaged x - ray surface brightness and projected gas temperature and metallicity profiles .",
    "the temperature and metallicity profiles are obtained from a single - temperature fit to the spectra in the 0.510  kev extracted in annuli with @xmath73 centered on a main cluster x - ray peak .",
    "the surface brightness profiles are extracted in the 0.72  kev band in narrow concentric annuli ( @xmath74 ) . using the effective area as a function of energy and",
    "observed projected temperature and metallicity at each radius , we then convert the observed _ chandra _ count rate in the 0.72  kev band into the projected emission measure , @xmath75 .",
    "three - dimensional profiles of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are reconstructed by using analytic 3d models with great functional freedom , projecting them along a line of sight , and fitting the projected models to observed profiles .",
    "the gas density model we use is given by @xmath78 this expression is a modification of the @xmath79-model @xcite that allows independent modeling of changes in the gas density slopes in cluster cores , outskirts , and intermediate radii .",
    "@xcite used an additional @xmath79-model component with small core - radius to further increase functional freedom in a very central region .",
    "we do not use this feature and instead focus on modeling the surface brightness in a region at @xmath80 .",
    "= 3.8truein    the analytic expression of a 3d temperature profile was designed to model general features of observed projected temperature profiles @xcite .",
    "the model consists of two terms : @xmath81 the first term , @xmath82 , describes a temperature decline at large radii by a broken power law profile with a transition region , @xmath83 the second term , @xmath84 , is designed to model the temperature decline in the central region affected by radiative cooling @xmath85 to fit the observed projected temperature profile , the model is projected along a line of sight .",
    "this projection requires proper weighting of multiple temperature components , and we use the algorithm that very accurately predicts a single - temperature fit to multi - component spectra in a wide range of temperatures recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "the observed projected temperature profiles are fit in the radial range between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a half of the mock _ chandra _ image size .",
    "the inner radial range is set to exclude central components with unrealistic x - ray properties found in most of our simulated clusters .",
    "the exact choice of @xmath89 is unimportant because we are primarily interested in the cluster properties at large radii .",
    "the choice of the outer radius is motivated by a desire to ensure accurate measurements of the temperature gradient and hence the @xmath8 at @xmath46 and that the fits in the cluster outskirts are not affected by projection effects .",
    "several examples of the observed surface brightness and projected temperature profiles are shown in figures  [ fig : cl7csf1_z0 ] and [ fig : cl101csf1_z0 ] along with their best fit models .",
    "we find that the models of eq.([eq : density : model ] ) and ( [ eq : tprof ] ) usually provide an excellent description of the data , except for very irregular clusters such as that in figure  [ fig : cl101csf1_z0 ] ( its x - ray image is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : images_z0 ] ) .",
    "given 3d models for the gas density and temperature profiles , the hydrostatic estimate of total cluster mass within a radius @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is mean molecular weight of the fully ionized h - he plasma used in the simulations .",
    "given @xmath93 , we compute the total mass at several overdensity levels , @xmath94 , relative to the critical density at the cluster redshift , by solving equation @xmath95 the icm mass profile is obtained directly from the best - fit number density profile ( eq.[eq : density : model ] ) , @xmath96 .    finally , we compute average temperatures for each cluster using different weightings of the best - fit 3d temperature models and observed projected profiles . in this study , we consider several definitions of average temperatures .",
    "the first is a x - ray spectral temperature , @xmath1 , a value derived from a single - temperature fit to the integrated cluster spectrum excluding the core and detectable small - scale clumps .",
    "we also compute a gas - mass - weighted temperature , @xmath2 , obtained by weighting of the reconstructed temperature profile with the derived gas density profile .",
    "we also consider an emission - weighted temperature , @xmath97 , computed by weighting @xmath98 with @xmath99 ; it is not directly observed but often used in the theoretical work .",
    "similarly , we compute a true gas - mass - weighted temperature @xmath100 from the simulations .",
    "the superscript `` sim '' indicates that the quantity is computed directly from the 3d gas properties in the simulations without excluding the _ chandra _ detectable clumps , as opposed to from the _ chandra _ analysis fits , throughout this work .",
    "all these average temperatures are computed excluding the central @xmath101 because temperatures at these radii can be strongly affected by radiative cooling and thus not directly related to the depth of the cluster potential well .",
    "also , because of the complex physics in the innermost cluster regions the simulated icm properties are probably not fully realistic .",
    "the outer radius of integration is set to @xmath46 , which approximately corresponds to the boundary within which the currently observed cluster temperature profiles are reliable @xcite .",
    "however , we also consider a spectral temperature @xmath102 $ ] measured within a smaller aperture of @xmath103 ; this definition may be more practical than @xmath1 integrated out to @xmath46 for observations of limited statistical quality or spatial coverage .",

    "the upper - middle panel shows the projected temperature profile obtained from the x - ray spectral fitting at each projected annulus .",

    "the figure also shows that the measured @xmath115 is biased high , on average , by about 10% at all radii , mainly due to the bias in the hydrostatic estimate of @xmath8 .",

    "additional complications arise from a non - ideal response of x - ray telescopes and limited statistical quality of data .",
    "this leads to several effects which are hard to reproduce analytically without creating mock x - ray data from realistic cluster simulations .",
    "for example , clumps of colder gas associated with massive subhalos can be detected and masked out from a further analysis while smaller subhalos remain undetected and bias projected temperature and x - ray brightness measurements @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of our work is to include all such effects as completely as possible in generation of the mock x - ray data and thus to test how they bias x - ray measurements and recovery of 3d icm profiles .",
    "reassuringly , we find that the icm models and analysis method presented in @xcite provide a good description of emission measure and projected temperature profiles of the icm . for relaxed clusters ,",
    "these models recover the 3d gas density , temperature , and gas mass profiles with the accuracy of _ a few percent _ at @xmath266 .",
    "the models are flexible enough to describe also non - relaxed systems and provide reasonably accurate gas mass and temperature measurements .",
    "a practical implication of these results is that projection effects , cluster substructure , and deviations from spherical symmetry do not strongly affect reconstruction of 3d icm density , temperature , pressure , and entropy profiles from x - ray data .",
    "therefore , observational results on icm profiles can be directly compared to the properties of simulated clusters without a need for detailed mock x - ray analyses .",
    "such a comparison for our sample will be presented in the future paper @xcite .",
    "the total icm mass is measured quite accurately in all our simulated clusters .",
    "results are most accurate for relaxed systems : biases and scatter in  measurements are accurate to better than @xmath267 percent , independent of a cluster redshift or a radial range within in which the  is measured . for unrelaxed systems , the scatter is larger , as expected @xcite , but the bias is still small ( @xmath268 ) .",
    "average temperature is an important diagnostic of properties and physical processes of the icm and a key observable for cosmological applications .",
    "since clusters are not isothermal , the definition of the @xmath10 is not unique nor can @xmath269 be completely accurately derived from data .",
    "mock x - ray analysis is therefore required to study the relation among different @xmath269 definitions used in observational and theoretical studies .",

    "we find that these temperatures are not identical , but the difference is mostly a constant factor with a relatively small object - to - object scatter .",
    "for example , @xmath270 for relaxed clusters , while for unrelaxed objects this ratio is @xmath271 .",
    "all the @xmath10 definitions we tested are therefore equivalent , but the difference should be kept in mind when , e.g. , observed @xmath224 relations are compared with results of simulations .",
    "a notable exception is the `` emission - weighted '' temperature defined as @xmath272 @xcite . even computed directly from the simulation outputs ,",
    "this quantity shows a much poorer correlation with @xmath216 than any of the observationally derived average temperatures ( fig.[fig : tbias_z0_true ] ) .",
    "our results thus support the suggestion of @xcite that @xmath273 should not be used as a measure of the average cluster temperature .",
    "one of the major applications of the gas density and temperature profile measurements from the x - ray data is the estimate of a gravitationally bound mass of a cluster assuming that the icm is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster potential .",
    "the x - ray method is by far the most precise way to estimate @xmath8 in individual objects at large radii .",
    "this limits our ability to test biases in the x - ray derived @xmath8 estimates through comparisons with independent observational techniques such as weak lensing .",
    "the analysis of our mock x - ray data , however , provides important clues .",
    "we find that the hydrostatic mass estimates from our mock data are biased low by about 5%20% throughout the virial region ( fig.[fig : mbias_z0_true ] ) , even in clusters that are identified as relaxed by their x - ray morphology .",
    "such biases seem to be too high to be attributed to inaccuracies in 3d gas density and temperature profile reconstruction .",
    "a more plausible explanation is a departure of the icm from a hydrostatic state .",
    "indeed , an additional pressure component due to residual random bulk motions of the icm in our simulated clusters completely explains the bias in the hydrostatic mass estimates ( this topic will be discussed in greater detail in * ? ? ?",
    "similar results have been also obtained by independent simulations performed with different codes and implementation of physical processes @xcite . the @xmath8 bias derived in the mock x - ray analysis of our relaxed clusters increases towards their outskirts .",
    "the average levels are @xmath274 at @xmath140 and @xmath275 at @xmath276 , and quickly become very large beyond @xmath46 ( fig.[fig : cl7csf1_z0 ] ) , which qualitatively mimic the radial dependence of turbulent pressure observed in previous simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in unrelaxed clusters ,",
    "not only the departures from hydrostatic equilibrium are strong but also the density and temperature gradients are not measured accurately ( fig.[fig : cl101csf1_z0 ] ) resulting in @xmath8 biases of 20% or more at all radii .",
    "it is unclear to what degree the level of icm turbulence found in these simulations applies to real clusters because most of the codes model icm as an ideal inviscid fluid with some amount of numerical viscosity .",
    "further progress in this area using cosmological simulations will have to rely on better understanding and modeling of viscosity of the weakly magnetized plasma @xcite .",
    "direct measurements of the icm turbulence through doppler broadening of emission lines @xcite must await a launch of x - ray calorimeters , although some clues could be provided also by observations of x - ray brightness fluctuations @xcite . keeping these uncertainties in mind",
    ", we can treat the @xmath8 biases quoted above as upper limits .",
    "cosmic rays and magnetic fields may also provide non - thermal pressure support which is not accounted for in the hydrostatic estimates nor included in our simulations .",
    "in addition , temperatures of electron and ion components of the icm are not necessarily the same , because strong shocks heat primarily ions and the collisional electron - ion equilibration time is long in the cluster outskirts @xcite . if @xmath277 ( derived from x - ray spectra ) is indeed lower that @xmath54 ( unobserved ) , the hydrostatic mass estimates are biased low .",
    "we note , however , that at least in one case there is evidence for fast equilibration of the electron and ion temperatures in a post - shock region of the icm @xcite .",
    "while direct measurements or theoretical modeling of the non - thermal pressure support may be difficult , it can be constrained by comparisons of the hydrostatic mass estimates with those derived from gravitational lensing for the same objects .",
    "an important caveat is that lensing measures the mass in the projected aperture while the mass within the sphere of the same radius is rather uncertain because of projection effects .",
    "@xcite estimate that @xmath278 can not be determined from weak lensing with better than @xmath27930% uncertainty .",
    "any comparisons of x - ray hydrostatic and weak lensing masses must be done in an average sense , e.g. through derived normalizations of the correlation between the @xmath8 and a low - scatter mass proxy such as @xmath280 @xcite or @xmath1 .    to summarize ,",
    "our results indicate that an x - ray analysis of relaxed clusters correctly recovers gas density and _ thermal electron _ pressure gradients .",
    "the simulations provide an upper limit ( 5%20% depending on radius ) for the mass bias due to turbulent motions .",
    "the contribution of other pressure components will have to be constrained by future observations .",
    "x - ray measurements of the baryonic mass fraction in massive clusters can be used to constrain @xmath3 or @xmath281 @xcite and also provide a potential standard candle @xcite .",
    "the major observational ingredient in these tests is a measurement of the hot gas mass fraction within a sufficiently large radius .",
    "our analysis provides clues for biases in @xmath115 measurements from high - quality _ chandra _ data .",
    "we find that the @xmath115 determinations are biased high , primarily because the hydrostatic method underestimates the total cluster mass . as was discussed above",
    ", the bias in the hydrostatic estimates is related to the physical processes in the icm ( e.g. , turbulence , cosmic ray and magnetic pressures etc . ) and not to the deficiencies of the x - ray analysis .",
    "further progress in confirming validity of @xmath115 measurements will have to rely on independent determinations of cluster total mass ( see discussion in   [ sec : accur - hydr - total ] ) .",
    "some sources of the bias ( e.g. , turbulence ) could be minimized if we focus only on relaxed systems .",
    "we find that in such systems , both bias and scatter in @xmath115 can be controlled to within about 5%8% at @xmath137 and 15%20% at @xmath46 , which can be considered the upper limits on the @xmath115 measurement bias caused by turbulence ( see   [ sec : accur - hydr - total ] ) .",
    "note that if the icm turbulence and other processes discussed in ",
    "[ sec : accur - hydr - total ] do play a role in biasing the hydrostatic mass estimates , the bias can potentially be redshift - dependent since the merger rate increases at higher @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we do not find any detectable redshift dependence of the bias in the @xmath115 measurements in relaxed systems .",
    "however , our upper limits , @xmath282 , are weaker than the accuracy required , e.g. , for using @xmath115 as a standard ruler in the dark energy studies @xcite .",
    "mock analysis of much larger cluster samples will be required to properly address this issue .",
    "another group of cosmological tests are those based on measurements of the cluster mass function .",
    "the relevant issue for our work is how well various mass proxies can be measured .",
    "a related question is how well the cluster mass vs. proxy relation can be calibrated by the x - ray analysis , which was discussed in ",
    "[ sec : accur - hydr - total ] .",
    "we did not discuss the easiest x - ray mass proxy , the total luminosity , because it is also the least accurate and least reliably reproduced by numerical simulations .",
    "the next , in terms of being easily measured , is the average icm temperature .",
    "the practical averages to use are @xmath1 or @xmath283 require measurements of the temperature _ profiles _ which is feasible only for a few best - observed clusters . ] . these definitions are freely interchangeable since the ratio @xmath284 is nearly the same in all clusters ( fig.[fig : tbias_z0_true ] , table  [ tab : tbias1 ] )",
    ". one disadvantage of the spectral temperature as a mass proxy is that its measurement is somewhat sensitive to the cluster dynamical state and small - scale substructure .",
    "this sensitivity arises because @xmath1 is rather sensitive to the presence of lower - temperature components .",
    "this effect contributes to the systematic difference in the normalizations of the @xmath224 relation between relaxed and non - relaxed clusters and also slight deviations from the self - similar evolution ( table  [ tab : mt ] ) .",
    "some implications of this effect for the cosmological measurements are discussed by @xcite .",
    "the prospects for calibrating the @xmath1 measurement biases by cosmological numerical simulations are mixed .",
    "the effects related to the cluster dynamics , such as merger activity and shocks etc . , are treated sufficiently accurately . however , the biases caused by the presence of undetected cold clumps will require a more realistic modeling of the icm cooling and associated feedback .",
    "more accurate x - ray proxies for cluster total mass is the mass of the hot gas , @xmath7 , and the `` x - ray @xmath285-parameter '' , @xmath286 @xcite .",
    "the properties of @xmath280 ( this is the best x - ray mass proxy known ) are extensively discussed elsewhere @xcite , so we concentrate on @xmath7 here .",
    "the @xmath7 is measured very reliably .",
    "the average bias is @xmath287 with only a few strong outliers ( fig.[fig : mbias_z0_true ] ) and there is no detectable redshift dependence .",
    "a similar accuracy should in principle be achieved for the @xmath8 estimates since to the first order , @xmath288 .",
    "note that the biases in @xmath7 measurements are mostly due to large - scale deviations of the cluster body from spherical symmetry .",
    "this effect should be reliably treated in the current generation cosmological simulations , and so the accuracy of the @xmath7-based total mass estimates can be improved yet further .",
    "all we need is a larger sample of simulated clusters . a major obstacle",
    ", however , is the uncertainties in the mass fraction of cold baryons ( stars and molecular gas ) .",
    "this fraction can be substantial , as indicated by our simulations @xcite and significant deviations of the observed @xmath115 in clusters from the cosmic mean ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further progress in this area requires significant improvements in the reliability of the stellar mass measurements and treatment of the star formation in the simulations .",
    "we will further discuss these issues in the forthcoming papers .    to briefly summarize our results , we find that the analysis of deep x - ray observations of galaxy clusters can reliably recover its intended targets : the distribution of density and temperature of the hot icm .",
    "the accuracy of estimating the total cluster mass from these parameters is limited by additional physical processes in the icm , such as turbulence , magnetic and cosmic ray pressure , and possible departures from the electron - ion equilibrium .",
    "our work provides a realistic estimate of the effects of turbulence , which are found to cause underestimation of @xmath8 by 5%20% in clusters that can be visually classified as relaxed ( this can be considered as an upper limit for the bias if the icm viscosity is non - negligible ) .",
