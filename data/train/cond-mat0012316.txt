    "this conference is devoted to the physics of waves moving through a medium which affects them as would a background metric .",
    "there is therefore a natural analogy with waves propagating in a gravitational field  but we should take care not to push the analogy too far .",
    "these systems differ from real general relativity in that the medium constitutes a physical ther .",
    "while we may ignore the ther for many purposes , occasionally it is important .",
    "for example , if we wish to compute forces exerted by the waves , we must take into account any stress transmitted by the background medium .",
    "the natural tool for computing forces by tracking the flux of energy and momentum is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this is best defined as the functional derivative of the action with respect to the background metric  but we have two metrics at our disposal : the spacetime metric and the acoustic or other metric which we are exploiting for our gr analogy . despite the temptation to believe otherwise , we should remember that it is only by differentiating with respect to the `` real '' metric that we obtain `` real '' energy and `` real '' momentum .",
    "when we differentiate with respect to the analogy metric , we obtain the density and flux of other quantities .",
    "these are usually the pseudoenergy and the pseudomomentum@xcite .",
    "failure to distinguish between real energy and momentum and pseudoenergy and pseudomomentum has caused much confusion and controversy over the years .",
    "consider the formula for the momentum of a photon in a dielectric : should the refractive index go in the numerator , where it was placed by minkowski , or in the denominator , as argued by abrahams ?",
    "this dispute was not resolved until blount@xcite identified minkowski s expression with the pseudomomentum and abrahams with the true momentum , including the mechanical momentum of the dielectric@xcite .",
    "although i will not address the problem here , my initial motivation for thinking about these topics was the fear that a similar confusion lies behind some recent controversies@xcite involving the iordanskii force .",
    "this force , which has an appealing gr analogue in the gravitational aharonov - bohm effect of a spinning cosmic string@xcite , is supposed to act on a vortex in a superfluid when it moves relative to the normal component of the fluid .",
    "a related issue , and one that i will address , lies at the heart of the two - fluid model for a superfluid or bose condensate .",
    "it is one of the fundamental assumptions of the two - fluid model that the phonons in a fluid possess momentum @xmath0 , and that , unlike that of phonons in a solid , this momentum is true newtonian momentum , @xmath1 .",
    "this assumption is essential because we wish to identify the phonon momentum density with the mass current , both being equal to @xmath2 .",
    "the desired identification is supported by the approximate solution of bogoliubov s weakly interacting bose gas model , in which the phonon creation operator , @xmath3 , appears to be create bona - fide momentum , so it is quite unnerving to discover that in the literature of fluid mechanics the attribution of real momentum to a sound wave is regarded as a nave and dangerous fallacy .",
    "a particularly forceful statement of this opinion is to be found in the paper@xcite _ on the wave momentum myth _ , by michael mcintyre .    in the present article",
    "we will focus the difference between the true momentum and the pseudomomentum associated with the acoustic metric .",
    "the first part is a general pedagogical account of the distinction between momentum and pseudomomentum , and the circumstances under which the latter may be used for computing forces .",
    "the second part will discuss the energy and momentum associated with sound waves in a background flow@xcite .",
    "the distinction between true momentum and pseudomomentum is especially clear when we consider the problem of transverse vibrations on an elastic string .",
    "the action s = dx dt\\{2 y^2 -t2 y^2 } gives rise to the familiar wave equation y -ty=0 , with @xmath4 being the wave speed . by manipulating the wave equation we can establish two local conservation laws",
    "the first , \\ { 2 y^2 + t2 y^2}+",
    "\\{-ty y}=0 , is immediately recognizable as an energy conservation law , with the flux @xmath5 being the rate of doing work by an element of the string on its neighbor . the second , \\{-y y}+ \\{2 y^2 + t2 y^2}=0 , is slightly more obscure in its interpretation .    in a relativistic system",
    "the appearance of @xmath6 ( energy flux)@xmath7 as the local density of a conserved quantity would not be surprising .",
    "the symmetry of the energy - momentum tensor requires that @xmath8 , so the energy flux @xmath9 is also ( after division by @xmath10 ) the density of 3-momentum . here , however , we are dealing with non - relativistic classical mechanics",
    " and with transverse waves . whatever the quantity @xmath11 may be , it is _ not _ the density of the @xmath12 component of the string s momentum .",
    "it is instead the density of _ pseudomomentum_.    to understand the origin of pseudomomentum , observe that our elastic string may be subjected to two quite distinct operations either of which might be called `` translation in the @xmath12 direction '' :    * an operation where the string , together with any disturbance on it , is translated in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "* an operation where the string itself is left fixed , but the disturbance is translated in the @xmath12 direction .    the first operation leaves the action invariant provided space is homogeneous .",
    "the associated conserved quantity is true newtonian momentum .",
    "the second operation is a symmetry only when both the background space _ and the string _ are homogeneous .",
    "the conserved quantity here is pseudomomentum .",
    "such a distinction between true and pseudo- momentum is necessary whenever a medium ( or ther ) is involved .",
    "adding to the confusion is that , although the pseudomomentum is conceptually distinct from the the true momentum , there are many circumstances in which changes in pseudomomentum can be used to compute real forces . as an example consider a high speed train picking up its electrical power from an overhead line .",
    "the locomotive is travelling at speed @xmath13 and the pantograph pickup is exerting a constant vertical force @xmath14 on the power line .",
    "we make the usual small amplitude approximations and assume ( not unrealistically ) that the line is supported in such a way that its vertical displacement obeys an inhomogeneous klein - gordon equation y -t y ",
    "+ ^2 y = f(x - ut ) , [ eq : locokg ] with @xmath15 , the velocity of propagation of short wavelength disturbances .    if @xmath16 , the vertical displacement relaxes symmetrically about the point of contact .",
    "once @xmath13 exceeds @xmath17 , however , the character of the problem changes from elliptic to hyperbolic , and an oscillatory `` wake '' forms behind the pantograph . as with all such wakes ,",
    "the disturbance is stationary when viewed from the frame of the train . with this in mind",
    ", we seek a solution to ( [ eq : locokg ] ) of the form @xmath18 .",
    "since the overhead line is undisturbed ahead of the locomotive , we find y&= & ( ut - x),x < ut + y&= & 0,x > ut .",
    "[ eq : solution_y ] here @xmath19 is the lorentz contraction factor modified for tachyonic motion .",
    "the condition that the phase velocity , @xmath20 , of the wave constituting the wake be equal to the forward velocity of the object creating it is analogous to the landau criterion determining the critical velocity of a superfluid .",
    "there are no waves satisfying this condition when @xmath21 , but they exist for all @xmath22 .    in the wake , the time and space averaged energy density @xmath23 is given by = 12 ^4 ( f t)^2 u^2 .",
    "the expression for the pseudomomentum density for the klein - gordon equation is the same as that for the wave equation , and the average pseudomomentum density is = 12 ^4 ( f t)^2 u. [ eq : pmom_density ]    because energy is being transfered from the locomotive to the overhead line , it is clear that there must be some induced drag , @xmath24 , on the locomotive .",
    "this is most easily computed from energy conservation .",
    "the rate of working by the locomotive , @xmath25 , must equal the energy density times the rate of change of the length of the wave - train .",
    "( u - u_g ) where u_g= = = is the group velocity of the waves , and so the speed of the trailing end of the wake wave - train .",
    "after a short calculation we find that the wave - induced drag force is f_d= 12 .",
    "since the average pseudomomentum density turned out to be the average energy density divided by @xmath13 , we immediately verify that we get exactly the same answer for @xmath24 if we equate the wave drag to the time rate of change of the total pseudomomentum .    for the sceptic we note that we may also obtain the same answer by a more direct evaluation of the force required to deflect the overhead wire .",
    "from the solution ( [ eq : solution_y ] ) we see that the force @xmath14 is related to the angle of upward deflection , @xmath26 , by @xmath27 . by balancing the acceleration of the power line against the force and the tension in the line , we see that the force can not be exactly vertical , but must be symmetrically disposed with respect to the horizontal and deflected parts of the line .",
    "the force exerted by the pantograph thus has a small horizontal component @xmath28 .",
    "the wave drag is therefore @xmath29 , as found earlier .",
    "since there is a real horizontal force acting on the wire , true newtonian momentum must also be being transfered to the wire .",
    "indeed the wire behind the train is being stretched , while that in front is being compressed .",
    "a section of length @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the velocity of _ longitudinal _ waves on the wire and @xmath32 is the elapsed time , is in uniform motion in the @xmath12 direction . since usually @xmath33 , this true momentum",
    "is accounted for by an almost infinitesimal motion over a large region of the wire .",
    "the pseudomomentum and the true momentum are to be found in quite different places  but the divergence of their flux tensors , and hence the associated forces , are equal .",
    "in this section we will consider the `` radiation pressure '' exerted by sound waves incident on an object immersed in the medium .",
    "this is a subject with a long history of controversy@xcite .",
    "the confusion began with the great lord rayleigh who gave several inequivalent answers to the problem .",
    "our discussion will follow that of leon brillouin@xcite who greatly clarified the matter .",
    "we begin by considering some analogous situations where the force is exerted by transverse waves on a string .",
    "consider a standing wave on a semi - infinite elastic string .",
    "we have restricted the vibration to the finite interval @xmath34 $ ] by means of a frictionless bead which forces the transverse displacement of the string to be zero at @xmath35 , but allows free passage to longitudinal motion , and so does not affect the tension .",
    "suppose the transverse displacement is y = a t with @xmath36 .",
    "the total energy of the motion is e= dx \\ { 12 y^2 + 12 t y^2}= 14 ^2 a^2 l.    if we alter the size of the vibrating region by slowly moving the bead , we will alter the energy in the oscillations .",
    "this change in energy may be found by exploiting the boltzmann - ehrenfest principle which says that during an adiabatic variation of the parameters of a harmonic oscillator the quantity @xmath37 remains constant .",
    "thus @xmath38 or @xmath39 . to apply this to the string",
    ", we note that = ( ) = - .",
    "the change in energy , and hence the work we must do to move the bead , is then e = - ( ) dl .",
    "the `` radiation pressure '' is therefore @xmath40 , the mean energy density .",
    "this calculation can be confirmed by examining the forces on the bead along the lines of fig .",
    "the average density of pseudomomentum in each of the two travelling wave components of the standing wave is @xmath41 .",
    "the radiation `` pressure '' can therefore be accounted for by the @xmath42 rate of change of the pseudomomentum in the travelling waves as they bounce off the bead .",
    "thinking through this example shows why pseudomomentum can be used to compute real forces : on a homogeneous string the act of translating the bead and the wave together , while keeping the string fixed , leaves the action invariant .",
    "the associated conserved quantity is the sum of the _ pseudomomentum _ of the wave and the _ true _ momentum of the bead .",
    "keeping track of pseudomomentum can not account for all forces , however .",
    "there is another plausible way of defining the radiation pressure .",
    "this time we use a finite string and attach its right - hand end to a movable wall    now , as we alter the length of the string , we will change its tension , and so alter the value of @xmath17 .",
    "we must take the effect of this into account in the variation of the frequency = ( ) = - + .",
    "the change in the energy of the vibrating system is therefore e",
    "= - ( 1- ) l. the radiation pressure is thus given by p= ( 1- ) .",
    "this force is in addition to the steady pull from the static tension @xmath43 in the string .",
    "the generality of the boltzmann - ehrenfest principle allows us to apply the previous discussion with virtually no changes to compute forces exerted by a sound wave .",
    "we need no explicit details of the wave motion beyond it being harmonic .",
    "the two ways of defining the radiation pressure for a vibrating string correspond to two different experimental conditions that we might use for measuring the radiation pressure for sound waves .",
    "the movable end condition corresponds to what is called the _",
    "rayleigh _ sound pressure .",
    "we establish a standing wave in a cylinder closed at one end and having a movable piston at the other . moving the piston confining the sound wave changes both the wavelength of the sound and the speed of propagation , producing a sound radiation pressure p= ( 1 + ( ) _ s ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath44 on the derivative indicates that it is being taken at fixed entropy . as with the string , this radiation pressure is in addition to the equilibrium hydrostatic pressure , @xmath45 , on the piston .",
    "the analogue of the string with the sliding bead leads to the _ langevin _ definition of the radiation pressure . here",
    "we insert a bypass so that moving the piston confining the sound wave does not change the density or pressure of the fluid .",
    "the radiation pressure on the piston is simply @xmath46 .",
    "the difference in the two definitions of radiation pressure arises because , if we keep the mean pressure fixed , the presence of a sound wave produces an @xmath47 change in the volume of the fluid . if , instead , the mean density is held fixed , as it is in the rayleigh definition , then this volume change is resisted by an additional hydrostatic pressure on the walls of the container .",
    "the most common way of measuring sound pressure involves a sound beam in an open tank of fluid .",
    "since the fluid is free to expand , this corresponds to the langevin pressure .",
    "the radiation pressure is , in reality , a radiation _ stress _ _ ij = ( + _ ij ( ) _ s ) .",
    "the anisotropic part depends on the wave - vector @xmath48 of the sound beam , and may be accounted for by keeping track of the pseudomomentum changes .",
    "the isotropic part can not be computed from the linearized sound - wave equation since it requires more information about the equation of state of the fluid medium than is used in deriving the wave equation . the extra information is encapsulated in the parameter @xmath49 , a fluid - state analogue of the grneisen parameter which characterizes the thermal expansion of a solid .",
    "when the experimental situation is such that this isotropic pressure is important , the force associated with the sound field can not be obtained from the pseudomomentum alone .",
    "further confusion involving momentum and pseudomomentum in acoustics is generated by the need to distinguish between the euler ( velocity field at a particular point ) description of fluid flow , and the lagrangian ( following the particles ) description .",
    "suppose the velocity field in a sound wave is v_(1)(x , t ) = a ( kx - t ) .",
    "using the continuity equation @xmath50 , setting @xmath51 , and approximating @xmath52 , we find that _",
    "1= 1_0 k a ( kx - t ) + o(a^2 ) .",
    "the time average of the momentum density @xmath53 is therefore = = 12 a^2 , [ eq : mom_momav ] to @xmath47 accuracy .",
    "this newtonian momentum density is clearly non - zero , and numerically equal to the pseudomomentum density . here , unlike the case of the elastic string",
    ", there is only one velocity of wave propagation and so the pseudomomentum and true momentum , although logically distinct , are to be found in the same place .",
    "further @xmath54 is both the momentum density and the mass - current .",
    "a nonzero average for the former therefore implies a steady drift of particles in the direction of wave propagation , in addition to the back - and - forth motion in the wave .",
    "we can confirm this by translating the eulerian velocity field @xmath55 into lagrangian language .",
    "the trajectory @xmath56 of a particle intially at @xmath57 is the solution of the equation = v_(1)((t),t)= a ( k - t),(0)=x_0 .",
    "[ eq : mom_nle ] since the quantity @xmath58 appears both in the derivative and in the cosine , this is a nonlinear equation .",
    "we solve it perturbatively by setting ( t ) = x_0 + a _",
    "1(t ) + a^2 _",
    "2(t ) + . we find that _",
    "1(t ) = - 1(kx_0-t ) . substituting this into ( [ eq : mom_nle ] ) we find = ^2(kx_0-t ) .",
    "thus @xmath59 has a non - vanishing time average , @xmath60 , leading to a secular drift velocity @xmath61 that is consistent with ( [ eq : mom_momav ] ) .",
    "this motion is called the _ stokes drift_.    we also see why there is no net newtonian momentum associated with phonons in a crystal . the atomic displacements in a harmonic crystal are given by _",
    "n = a ( k(na)-t ) , so the crystal equivalent of ( [ eq : mom_nle ] ) is = a ( k(na)-t ) .",
    "thus @xmath62 does not appear on the right - hand side of this equation .",
    "it is a linear equation and gives rise to no net particle drift .",
    "so , a sound wave does have real momentum ?  but wait ! the momentum density we have computed is _ second order _ in the amplitude @xmath63 . the wave equation we have used to compute",
    "it is accurate only to _ first order _ in @xmath63 .",
    "we may expand the velocity field as = _",
    "( 1)+_(2)+ , where the second - order correction @xmath64 arises because the equations of fluid motion are non - linear . this correction will possess both oscillating and steady components .",
    "the oscillatory components arise because a strictly harmonic wave with frequency @xmath65 will gradually develop higher frequency components due to the progressive distortion of the wave as it propagates .",
    "( a plane wave eventually degenerates into a sequence of shocks . )",
    "these distortions are usually not significant in considerations of energy and momentum balance .",
    "the steady terms , however , represent @xmath47 alterations to the mean flow caused by the sound waves , and these may possess energy and momentum comparable to that of the sound field .    for example , we may drive a transducer so as to produce a beam of sound which totally fills a closed cylinder of fluid . at the far end of the cylinder a second transducer with suitably adjusted amplitude and phase absorbs the beam without reflection . since the container is not going anywhere , it is clear that the average velocity of the center of mass of the fluid must be zero , despite the presence of the sound wave .",
    "an exact solution of the non - linear equation of motion for the fluid must provide a steady component in @xmath64 and this counterflow completely cancels the @xmath66 term . indeed in lagrangian coordinates the fluid particles simply oscillate back and forth with no net drift . the wave momentum and its cancelling counterflow are simply artifacts of our eulerian description .",
    "this is one reason why professional fluid mechanics dislike the notion of momentum being associated with sound waves .",
    "the outlook for the two - fluid model is not entirely bleak , however .",
    "the @xmath64 corrections do not always exactly cancel the momentum .",
    "any non - zero value for @xmath67  such as occurs at the transducers at the ends of the cylinder  will act as a source or sink for a @xmath64 counterflow , but its exact form depends on the shape of the container and other effects extrinsic to the sound field . for transducers immersed in an infinite volume of fluid ,",
    "for example , the counterflow will take the form of a source - sink dipole field , and , although the total momentum of the fluid will remain zero , there will be a non - zero momentum density .",
    "because it is not directly associated with the sound field , in the language of the two - fluid model the induced @xmath64 counterflow is not counted as belonging to the normal component of the fluid , _ i.e. _ to the phonons , but is lumped into the background superflow .",
    "it is determined by enforcing mass conservation , _ s * v*_s+ _ n * v*_n=0 .",
    "the difference of opinion between the physics and fluid mechanics communities over whether phonons have real momentum reduces , therefore , to one of different accounting conventions .",
    "now we will examine the energy and momentum in a moving fluid .",
    "the flow of an irrotational fluid is derivable from the action @xcite s= d^4x\\ { + 12 ( ) ^2 + u()}. [ eq : basic_action ] here @xmath68 is the mass density , @xmath69 the velocity potential , and the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time .",
    "the function @xmath70 may be identified with the internal energy density .",
    "varying with respect to @xmath69 yields the continuity equation + ( ) = 0 , [ eq : continuity ] where @xmath71 .",
    "varying @xmath68 gives a form of bernoulli s equation + 12 v^2 + ( ) = 0 , [ eq : bernouilli ] where @xmath72 .",
    "in most applications @xmath73 would be identified with the specific enthalpy . for a superfluid condensate the entropy density , @xmath74 , is identically zero and @xmath73 is the local chemical potential .",
    "the gradient of the bernoulli equation is euler s equation of motion for the fluid .",
    "combining this with the continuity equation yields a momentum conservation law _ t(v_i)+_j(v_j",
    "v_i ) + _ i = 0 .",
    "[ eq : momcons1 ] we simplify ( [ eq : momcons1 ] ) by introducing the pressure , @xmath75 , which is related to @xmath73 by @xmath76",

    "ji=0 , where @xmath77 is given by _",
    "ij= v_iv_j+_ijp .",

    "although it comes close , the inability of the pseudomomentum flux to exactly capture the true - momentum flux is inevitable as we know that computing the true stresses in the medium requires more information about the equation of state than is available to the linearized wave equation .",
    "we can also write the mixed co- and contra - variant components of the energy momentum tensor @xmath123 in terms of physical quantities .",
    "this mixed tensor turns out to be more useful than the doubly contravariant tensor . because we no longer enforce a symmetry between the indices @xmath73 and @xmath124 , the quantity @xmath119 is no longer required to perform double duty as both an energy and a density .",

    "[ eq : momnoncon ] here connection terms have provided a source term for the momentum density .",

    "the conservation laws we have derived in the previous section may all be interpreted in terms of the semiclassical motion of phonons . as noted by mcintyre@xcite ,",
    "the existence of such an interpretation is a sure sign that the conservation laws in question are those of pseudomomentum and pseudoenergy .    to make contact with the semiclassical picture we observe that when the mean flow varies slowly on the scale of a wavelength , the sound field can locally be approximated by a plane wave ( x , t)= a ( * k * -t ) .",

    "the second term must therefore also vanish .",
