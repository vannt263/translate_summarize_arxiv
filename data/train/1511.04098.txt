    "astrophysical observations indicate that the matter content of the universe is overwhelmingly dominated by dark matter ( dm ) , the energy density of which exceeds that of ordinary matter by a factor of five . in order to explain the observed abundance of dm , it is reasonable to expect that dm interacts non - gravitationally with ordinary matter .",
    "searches for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dm , which look for the scattering of wimps off nuclei , have not yet produced a strong positive result .",
    "further progress with these traditional searches is hindered by the observation that the sought effects are fourth - power in the underlying interaction strength between dm and standard model ( sm ) matter , which is known to be extremely small .",
    "we propose to search for other well - motivated dm candidates that include the axion , which may also resolve the strong _ cp _ problem of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , by exploiting effects that are first - power in the interaction strength between the axion and sm matter ( by contrast , haloscope @xcite and helioscope @xcite methods look for second - power effects , while light - shining - through - wall methods @xcite look for fourth - power effects ) .",
    "we focus on the oscillating electric dipole moments ( edms ) and spin - precession effects that axions induce in atoms and molecules .",
    "there is strong motivation to search for axions in atomic and related systems via such signatures  to date , static edm measurements in atoms , molecules and ultracold neutrons have served as sensitive probes of new physics beyond the standard model ( see e.g.  the reviews @xcite ) , while searches for sidereal spin - precession effects with atoms and ultracold neutrons have placed stringent limits on _ cpt_- and lorentz - invariance - violating models ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) .",
    "axions produced by the vacuum misalignment mechanism are cold with no pressure . furthermore , if axions are sufficiently light and weakly interacting , then they may survive until the present day and reside in the observed galactic dm haloes ( where they have become virialised over time with @xmath1 ) .",
    "the number density of ultralight ( sub - ev mass ) axions per de broglie volume readily exceeds unity , @xmath2 , meaning that axions behave as a coherently oscillating classical field , @xmath3 on time scales less than @xmath4 and on length scales less than @xmath5 .",
    "thus the couplings of an oscillating galactic axion field to sm particles produce a number of oscillating signatures which can be sought for experimentally .",
    "as we will see below , the particularly interesting signatures are those where the observables scale as @xmath6 with the axion decay constant @xmath7 .",
    "the axion couplings to sm particles that are of most interest are the following : @xmath8 where the first term represents the coupling of the axion field to the gluonic field tensor @xmath9 and its dual @xmath10 , and the second term represents the coupling of the derivative of the axion field to the fermion axial - vector currents .",

    "the dfsz model , where the tree level coupling of the axion to the electron is non - vanishing , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , within the ksvz model , @xmath14 , since the tree level coupling vanishes and the dominant effect arises at the 1-loop level @xcite . for more generic axion - like pseudoscalar particles , the coefficients @xmath11 are essentially free parameters , and the coupling to gluons is generally presumed absent .",

    "two atoms that are of particular experimental interest are @xmath23hg and @xmath24ra , for which the axion induces the following oscillating edms @xcite : @xmath25 with the large enhancement in @xmath24ra compared with @xmath23hg due to both collective effects and small energy separation between members of the parity doublet concerned , which occurs in nuclei with octupolar deformation and results in a significant enhancement of the nuclear schiff moment @xcite .",

    "firstly , axion - induced oscillating nuclear magnetic quadrupole moments ( which require @xmath27 ) also produce an oscillating atomic / molecular edm @xcite , which is typically larger than that due to an oscillating nuclear schiff moment ( since magnetic quadrupole moments are not subject to screening of the applied electric field by atomic / molecular electrons ) .",
