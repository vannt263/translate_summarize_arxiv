    "mnsi is a well - known weakly helimagnetic system which has given a lot of experimental supports to the self consistent renormalized spin fluctuations theory ( referred henceforth as the scr theory ) developed by moriya and co - workers ( for a general review see ref .  ) . at ambient pressure",
    "both macroscopic ( electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , magnetization)@xcite and microscopic properties ( nuclear magnetic relaxation and neutrons scattering ) @xcite are quantitatively well interpreted in the frame of a scr treatment of the magnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "although the scr theory furnishs a phenomenological treatment of the long wavelength - low energy spin - fluctuations , it successfully explains the low value of the curie temperature @xmath11=29.4  k , the @xmath12 low temperature thermal variation of the electrical resistivity @xmath13 , the high temperature constant value exhibited by the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath14 , and above all the puzzling curie - weiss like behaviour of the paramagnetic susceptibility , @xmath15 .",
    "magnetization measurements under pressure in this compound have already been reported in a previous study up to 5.2  kbar by bloch et al.@xcite . however since that time several studies have shown the crucial role played by the hydrostatic pressure on the magnetic ground state of this compound @xcite . in particular , the existence of a critical pressure , @xmath16=15  kbar , where the system undergoes a magnetic to non magnetic transition at @xmath9 ( quantum phase transition ) has been pointed out@xcite . recently , in the vicinity of this quantum critical point , it has been interestingly sheded light on the fact that the disappearance of the long range helimagnetic order was accompanied by the occurrence of the so - called _ itinerant electron metamagnetic _",
    "transition under an external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "this first order magnetic phase transition is a common feature shown by other 3d itinerant magnetic systems , especially when the external temperature independent parameter tuning the quantum magnetic instability is the chemical substitution , @xmath17 , ( y(co@xmath18al@xmath19 @xcite , co(se@xmath18s@xmath20)@xmath21 @xcite ) and more seldom the hydrostatic pressure , @xmath22 , ( cos@xmath21 @xcite ) .",
    "although this magnetic phenomena has been largely enligthened by various experimental works , its theoretical treatment is actually not unanimously recognized with notably the ambiguity between the role played by the band structure effect at the fermi level@xcite and the influence of an external parameter on the spin fluctuations spectrum @xcite . in view of this uncleared situation",
    ", it appears interesting to extend the measurements of the magnetization properties in this compound up to the highest pressure actually available with our technique ( 11  kbar ) .",
    "for this experiment a single crystal of mnsi with parallelepiped shapes and typical dimensions of 3@xmath230.3@xmath230.5  mm ( total weight of 29.4  mg ) has been measured .",
    "the measurements were performed using an he@xmath24 cryostat in a temperature range from 4.2  k to 60  k. the external magnetic field was supplied by a 9  tesla superconducting magnet and the weak magnetic anisotropy of mnsi has permitted to apply the external field in an undefined crystallographic direction .",
    "the hydrostatic pressure was generated by a non - magnetic clamp - type pressure cell of small dimensions with a maximal enable pressure of almost 11  kbar .",
    "the original ti - cu alloyed composition of the clamp core added to a set of ceramic - type pistons give a small diamagnetic contribution to the background signal allowing absolute value measurements under pressure even in a strong external magnetic field .",
    "the principle of the measure is based on the oscillation of the whole pressure cell in a two pick - up coils system .",
    "the signal is analyzed by the extraction method .",
    "this experiment has been carried out at the institute for solid state physics in the university of tokyo .",
    "the fig .  [ fig1 ] gives the evolution of the isothermal magnetization process at @xmath25  k , for magnetic field up to 9  tesla and under different applied pressures . at ambient pressure",
    "the magnetic features are well understood as a rotation of the helical structure along the field direction ( @xmath26  koe ) followed by the disappearance of the magnetic domains in an unique conical phase ( 1  koe@xmath276.2  koe ) orientated in the field - direction . above @xmath28  koe , where the abrupt kink observed in the curve @xmath29 $ ] corresponds to the transition in an induced ferromagnetic state , we observe an unsaturated ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "all these features remain unchanged under pressure and it is noteworthy that the value of the characteristic fields , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , remain unchanged under pressure . the insert of the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the magnetization behavior at @xmath32  kbar for the both way of sweeping the magnetic field . below 1",
    "koe a tiny hysteresis is observable and clearly in this region the magnetization does not respond linearly to the applied field .",
    "however above 1  koe this hysteresis disappears and the magnetization corresponds to the conical phase and the unsaturated behavior of the induced ferromagnetic state above @xmath31 .",
    "these facts ensured a tangible proof that the heli - magnetic structure of mnsi persists even under high pressure ( at least up to 10.2  kbar ) and that no new magnetic structure transition is induced by pressure . by intercepting the high field regime of the magnetization at @xmath33",
    ", we obtain the value of the saturated magnetization @xmath4 , which at ambient pressure exhibits a value of 0.39  @xmath34/mn in accordance with previous results@xcite . from the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we see that the pressure effect is to lower the value of the magnetization and in particular leads to a decrease of the saturated magnetization value at @xmath25  k , @xmath35 $ ] . in order to extract a precise quantitative variation of @xmath36 $ ] we have presented on the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the so - called arrot - plot @xmath37 $ ] versus @xmath38 $ ] which gives a direct way to obtain this value .",
    "the axis have been drawn in a reduced units system such as the external magnetic field is expressed in energy units @xmath39 and the magnetization per magnetic atom ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 number of magnetic sites ) , is expressed in @xmath42 units . to obtain the saturated magnetization @xmath4 for each pressure we have estimated the @xmath17-axis intercept of the high magnetic field linear extrapolation .",
    "the evolution of @xmath4 , reported in the insert of the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , is surprisingly weak with pressure and this contrasts with the strong decrease of the corresponding curie temperature @xmath11 .",
    "it is noteworthy to underline that even close to the critical boundary ( @xmath43  kbar ) the saturated magnetization still exhibits a high value .",
    "quantitatively under an applied pressure of 10.2  kbar , the value of the saturated magnetization is only modified from 0.39 to 0.34  @xmath34/mn atom whereas @xmath11 drops from 29.4  k to 13.4  k ( cf . table  [ table1 ] for the detailed values ) .",
    "the weak decrease of the magnetization has been confirmed recently by zero - field nmr measurements under pressure@xcite showing the weak decrease of the transferred hyperfine field of the mn sites with pressure . in a good agreement with previous authors",
    "@xcite we find that @xmath44 ( @xmath45 in the case the previous results of bloch et al . ) .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the isothermal @xmath29 $ ] curves around @xmath11 for a pressure of 10.2  kbar .",
    "no metamagnetic transition either hysteretic process are observed around @xmath11 , in accordance with the fact that the transition is still of a second order nature up to 12.5  kbar@xcite .",
    "in the frame of the scr theory , the magnetic spin fluctuations are treated in a self consistent way and integrated in the magnetic equation of state .",
    "the nature of the spin fluctuations is therefore characterized by a small set of parameters expressed as @xmath4 , @xmath46 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the two first parameters are determinated by the knowledge of the magnetic equation of state given by the landau development of the magnetic free energy in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the intra - site coulombian interaction , @xmath50 the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath51 the magnetization expressed in @xmath52 units ( the saturated magnetization at @xmath9 , @xmath4 is with this convention such as @xmath53 ) and the parameter @xmath46 is the coefficient of mode - mode coupling between magnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "consequently , it is possible upon magnetization measurements and the analysis of the arrot - plot defined with our units systems such as @xmath54 $ ] versus @xmath55 $ ] , to obtain quantitative values for these two parameters .",
    "the two remaining parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are directly related to the imaginary part of the generalized dynamic susceptibility im@xmath56 .",
    "neutrons measurements on mnsi have clearly shown that in the weakly ferromagnetic limit , im@xmath56 has the lorentzian form in a small region of @xmath57 and @xmath58 close to the ferromagnetic instability vector @xmath59 and is expressed as : @xmath60 with @xmath61 the static uniform susceptibility , @xmath62 the spectral width of the magnetic sf excitations given by : @xmath63 @xmath64 is the inverse of the magnetic correlation length .",
    "this power spectrum of the magnetic spin fluctuations , im@xmath65 is in fact characterized by two temperatures scales , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , representing respectively the dispersion along the @xmath58-axis and the @xmath57-axis @xmath66 the effective boundary vector @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 ( @xmath69 the volume per magnetic atoms ) .",
    "usually these two temperatures scales are obtained upon microscopic measurements such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( spin - lattice relaxation rate and knight shift ) for @xmath6 and neutrons diffusion measurements for @xmath7 .",
    "the scr theory @xcite predicts a number of interesting crossed - relations between these differents parameters .",
    "for instance , the mode - mode coupling term can be remarquably expressed as function of the two temperatures scales , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath70 @xmath6 and @xmath7 can also be expressed in the following way as function of @xmath11 , @xmath4 and the ratio @xmath71 @xmath72 from the following expressions , we readily see that upon macroscopic measurements such as magnetization and the arrot plot analysis , giving access to the ratio @xmath71 , @xmath4 and the knowledge of the ordering temperature @xmath11 @xcite , we can estimate quantitatively the values of the energy scale of the spin fluctuations spectrum .",
    "the different values obtained upon the arrot - plot analysis and the eqs .",
    "( [ equ4 ] ) ( @xmath73 ) and ( [ equ6 ] ) ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) are listed in the table  [ table1 ] . in the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have compared the pressure effect on the characteristic temperatures in mnsi , @xmath11 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . as the pressure increases and the system is driven towards its quantum critical point , the energies @xmath6 and @xmath7 change in an appreciable way , indicating that the spectra of the magnetic excitations is largely modified by pressure due to a strong volume dependence of im@xmath74 in this compound .",
    "consequently , we can suppose that from both sides of the critical pressure , the spatial distribution of im@xmath56 is drastically modified and that a discontinous variation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is expected , corresponding to a modification of the magnetic spin fluctuations regime when crossing the critical boundary from the electronic spin - polarized state to the paramagnetic fermi liquid .",
    "in particular the sizeable decrease of the energy dispersion of the spin fluctuations modes , @xmath75 , presented in the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] indicates that these latter are more drastically over - damped at the approach of @xmath16 where the long range magnetic order has been shown to disappear and the system remains paramagnetic at all temperature . upon our experimental results we can estimate that the pressure effect on the damping rate of the magnetic spin fluctuations should be in the order of @xmath76 on the other hand ,",
    "the slope of the arrot - plot is almost not modified by pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) indicating that @xmath77 , the mode - mode coupling term , has only a weak pressure dependence .",
    "we deduce therefore that the pressure modified the spin - fluctuations spectra distribution but not the coupling strength between these latter .",
    "this scenario is based on thermodynamic measurements and must be completed by microscopic measurements under pressure .",
    "however , in view of these experimental results , it appears important to verify the accuracy of this analysis by additional measurements like neutrons inelastic diffusion experiment to study the evolution of @xmath6 or @xmath7 under pressure .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper tends to show that the evolution of the spin fluctuations spectra with pressure plays a key role in the occurrence of the itinerant electron metamagnetic phenomenon as advanced recently by takahashi and sakai .",
    "however the band structure effects induced by pressure can not be readily analyzed from this measurement .",
    "thus we do not exclude that such effects at the fermi level , as postulated by yamada , are not engaged in the itinerant electron metamagnetism process .",
    "our work mainly points out that probably a more refined theoretical treatment is needed in order to take into account the effects of both thermal and zero - point spin fluctuations modes on the magnetic ground state of the system .",
    "it seems to us that in mnsi the combined facts that there exists a well - pronounced difference in the volume dependence of the ordering temperature , @xmath11 , and the saturated magnetization , @xmath4 , and the fact that in this itinerant electron system the phenomenon of metamagnetism has been observed are strongly related .",
    "we believed that the physical origin is due to a strong volume dependence of the magnetic spin fluctuations spectrum in particular close to @xmath16 .",
    "one of us ( c.t ) is particularly indebted to both prof .",
    "y.  takahashi and prof .",
    "h.  yamada for fruitful and enlightening discussions about their different standpoints .",
