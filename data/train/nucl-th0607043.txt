    "the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) has been widely used in the theoretical study of nuclei within the valley of @xmath3-stability .",
    "the success of the rpa is mainly based on the use of the quasiboson approximation ( qba ) , which considers fermion pairs as boson operators , just neglecting the pauli principle between them . as a result ,",
    "a set of linear equations , called the rpa equations , was derived , which reveals the physics of collective excitations generated by the rpa boson - like modes .",
    "the simplicity of the rpa equations allows a feasible treatment of a number of many - body problems , which would be computationally intractable otherwise .",
    "however , this approach suffers a drawback : it breaks down at a certain critical value of the interaction s parameter , where the rpa yields imaginary solutions .",
    "the reason of this well - known rpa instability is the violation of pauli principle within the qba .    in @xmath3-stable medium and heavy nuclei ,",
    "the qba is a good approximation , and the rpa is a very powerful tool for the description of several important quantities such as the ground - state and excited - state energies , electro - magnetic transition probabilities and their distribution , transition densities , etc .",
    "the first - order diagram expansion beyond the mean field treated within the rpa includes significant effects of two - body correlations beyond the mean - field .",
    "however , with reducing the particle number , the concept of collective excitations , which are described by the rpa modes , becomes less and less firm .",
    "the ground - state correlations ( gsc ) which are left beyond the rpa become stronger in light systems .",
    "this feature makes the validity of the qba , and therefore of the rpa itself , questionable in the systems with small particle numbers .",
    "several approaches were developed to take into account the gsc beyond rpa in a simple way such as to restore the pauli principle among the fermion pairs , from which the rpa operators are constructed .",
    "the popular one , known as the renormalized rpa ( rrpa )  @xcite , includes the expectation value over the ground state of the diagonal elements of the commutator between two fermion - pair operators , neglected in the qba . in this way",
    "the pauli principle is approximately taken care of . the inclusion of gsc beyond rpa within the rrpa eventually renormalizes the interaction in such a way that the collapse of rpa is avoided , and the rrpa has solutions at any value of the interaction s parameter .",
    "this scheme has been tested in several exactly solvable schematic models such as the lipkin model for @xmath4 rrpa  @xcite , the so(8 ) model for the renormalized quasiparticle rpa  @xcite , and the richardson model for the @xmath5 rrpa and self - consistent rpa ( scrpa )  @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies showed that the difference between the energies of the first excited state given by the @xmath5 rpa , @xmath5 rrpa , and scrpa increases noticeably with increasing the interaction parameter and/or decreasing the particle number .",
    "the scrpa solutions are the closest ones to the exact solutions .",
    "these results raise a serious question of the applicability of the rpa to the calculations for realistic light - neutron rich nuclei . as a matter of fact",
    ", a close agreement between the rpa results and the experimental data for light neutron - rich nuclei can be considered really reasonable if the corrections due to gsc beyond rpa are negligible , which justify the validity of the qba  @xcite . in the opposite case",
    "such agreement may be even illusory .",
    "this concern is the motivation of the present work , whose goal is to test the consistency of the @xmath5 rpa and its renormalizations , the @xmath5 rrpa and scrpa , at different particle numbers as the interaction strength varies .",
    "the reason of choosing the @xmath5 rpa comes from one of its major merits , which allows the straightforward calculation of an important quantity in the study of unstable nuclei , namely the two - particle separation energy .",
    "indeed , the @xmath5 rpa uses the addition and removal phonon operators to create the ground states and excited states of the systems with @xmath1 and @xmath6 particles , respectively , from the ground state of the @xmath0-particle system . therefore the two - particle separation energy of the @xmath7-particle system can be calculated either as the energy of the lowest excited state generated by the addition mode , which adds two particles to the core with n particles , or as that generated by the removal mode , which removes two particles from the core with @xmath1 particles .",
    "a consistent theory should give identical results in either way of calculation . by analyzing the results obtained in two ways of calculations within all three approaches ,",
    "namely the rpa , rrpa , and scrpa in their application to an exactly solvable schematic model , namely the richardson model  @xcite , the present work may shed light on the consistency of these approaches , in particular , in their application to systems with small particle numbers ( light systems ) .",

    ", the recent calculations of the two - neutron separation energy @xmath155 in @xmath120be by using the gogny interaction have shown that the rrpa shifts the result by around 14@xmath156 for @xmath157be , and the consistency condition ( [ equal ] ) is not fulfilled ( @xmath144 10 ) for both the rpa and rrpa  @xcite . an easy way to see if the rpa needs to be renormalized is to estimate the occupation numbers ( [ fi ] ) using the backward - going amplitudes @xmath42 obtained within the rpa .",
    "if there is a strong deviation of @xmath158 ( @xmath145 ) from 0 ( 1 ) , this means that the validity of the rpa is deteriorated . in the above - mentioned calculations for be - isotopes e.g. , the occupation number of the last occupied shell amounts to around 0.8 within the rpa , and increases to around 0.95 within the rrpa , showing the necessity of using the scrpa , or at least the rrpa , instead of the rpa .",
    "the numerical calculations were carried out using the fortran imsl library by visual numerics on the riken super combined cluster ( rscc ) system .",
