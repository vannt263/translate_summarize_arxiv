    "in 2010 , loday @xcite introduced the class of parametrized one - relation algebras , which have one binary operation satisfying one multilinear relation of arity three .",

    "not much is known about parametrized one - relation operads in general .",
    "one natural question asked by loday in @xcite was to determine the values of parameters for which operad @xmath11 is koszul .",
    "the five examples above all are koszul , and they have one more common feature : all components of each of these operads are regular representations of the corresponding symmetric groups ( it is obvious for the first of them , and is well known for the others , see @xcite ) .",
    "this observation naturally leads to an attempt to search for other examples of koszul operads among the operads satisfying the same property .",
    "we say that the vector of coefficients @xmath16 in relation is _ regular _ if the following equivalent conditions hold :    * for each finite - dimensional vector space @xmath2 , the free algebra @xmath15 is isomorphic as a graded vector space ( _ not _ as a graded algebra ) to the non - unital tensor algebra @xmath17 .",
    "* for all @xmath18 , the @xmath14-module @xmath12 is isomorphic to the regular module @xmath19 .",
    "it is often the case that the term `` regular '' is used to describe symmetric operads obtained from nonsymmetric operads by symmetrization .",
    "we choose to break that tradition and use this more general notion that includes symmetrizations of nonsymmetric operads but is wider ( for instance , the operads @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not symmetrizations of nonsymmetric operads ) : the class of operads whose free algebras have the tensor algebras as underlying vector spaces is very natural , and the term `` regular '' is most appropriate for that property .    in this paper",
    "we give a complete classification of regular parametrized one - relation operads over an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath22 .",
    "the answer turns out to be wonderfully simple , however disappointing from the viewpoint of hunting for new koszul operads : up to isomorphism , every such operad is one of those in example [ fiveexamples ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning though , that for four of those operads , there is a one - parameter family of regular parametrized one - relation operads isomorphic to it .",
    "[ maintheorem ] over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 , every regular parametrized one - relation operad is isomorphic to one of the following five operads : the left - nilpotent operad defined by the identity @xmath3 , the associative operad , the leibniz operad @xmath20 , the dual leibniz ( zinbiel ) operad @xmath21 , and the poisson operad .",
    "it is an entertaining exercise to check that the five operads of example [ fiveexamples ] are pairwise nonisomorphic .",
    "one way to do that is as follows .",
    "the left - nilpotent operad , the associative operad , and the poisson operad are be easily seen to be isomorphic to their koszul duals .",
    "the koszul dual of the operad @xmath20 is isomorphic to the operad @xmath21 ; these two operads are not isomorphic because the suboperad generated by the @xmath23-invariants of @xmath24 is the operad @xmath25 of commutative associative algebras , whereas in the case of @xmath20 , we have @xmath26 , and therefore the symmetrized product @xmath27 satisfies the identity @xmath28 .",

    "the suboperads generated by the @xmath23-invariants and @xmath23-anti - invariants of @xmath29 are the operad @xmath25 and the operad @xmath30 of lie algebras respectively .",
    "only the second of these claims holds for the associative operad , and neither is true for the left - nilpotent operad .",

    "it is worth mentioning that in fact , our proof of the main theorem shows that this classification result holds over a field @xmath31 of characteristic zero where every quadratic equation has solutions ( equivalently , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the assumption on the characteristic is more fundamental : for example , the suboperad @xmath25 of @xmath33 naturally splits off as a direct summand , and this implies that the corresponding @xmath14-modules are , in general , not regular in positive characteristic .",
    "at a first glance , it is very natural to expect that most relations define an operad whose components are regular modules : one can say that re - association would permit rewriting every product as a combination of right - normed products @xmath34 which transform according to the regular representation .",
    "however , this strategy , when inspected more closely , exhibits many subtle phenomena : there are many ways at least to begin such rewriting , and at the same time , owing to the presence of all permutations on the right side of , it is not at all clear that such a re - association process will terminate .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the generic operad defined by is as far from having regular modules as components as possible .",
    "let @xmath35 be the set of all points @xmath36 in the parameter space @xmath37 for which the operad @xmath38 ( defined by @xmath39 ) is nilpotent of index @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41 is a zariski open subset in the parameter space .    in a nutshell , this follows from the fact that the stasheff associahedron @xcite of dimension @xmath42 , the pentagon , has the same number of vertices and edges ; its vertices correspond to basis elements of the free operad in arity @xmath40 , and its edges are in one - to - one correspondence with the formal consequences of one ternary relation . since the two numbers coincide , it is natural to expect that for a generic relation all operations of arity @xmath40 will vanish .",

    "however , if we assume that @xmath447 , that can not happen , as the following lemma shows .",
    "suppose that @xmath447 .",
    "then every operation in the corresponding operad is equal to a linear combination of right - normed products .",
    "let us consider some balanced bracketing of @xmath448 arguments .",
    "it is of the form @xmath449 , where @xmath211 and @xmath212 are balanced bracketings of fewer arguments , with @xmath450 arguments in @xmath211 and @xmath451 arguments in @xmath212 .",
    "we shall prove the statement by induction on @xmath57 , and for a fixed @xmath57 , by induction on @xmath450 .",
    "in both cases , the basis of induction is trivial : for @xmath452 there is nothing to prove , and for each @xmath57 and @xmath453 we may use the induction hypothesis and write @xmath212 as a linear combination of right - normed products ; the right - normed property does not change when we multiply by @xmath211 .",
    "assume that @xmath454 , so that @xmath455 ; we are in a situation where we can apply the defining relation of our operad , obtaining @xmath456 each of these terms has the parameter @xmath450 smaller than the original one , so the induction hypothesis applies .",
    "this lemma shows that under the assumption @xmath447 the spanning property of the right - normed products is trivially satisfied , so there is a surjective map from the regular representation of @xmath14 onto the @xmath13-th component of our operad .",
    "it remains to check that this map has no kernel .",
    "let us start with arity @xmath40 .",
    "note that the defining relation of our operad can be applied as a rewriting rule to the product @xmath159 in two different ways , by rewriting @xmath4 first , or by rewriting @xmath162 and setting @xmath161 , as in example [ antiassociativeexample ] .",
    "this leads to two _ a priori _ different expressions for @xmath159 as linear combinations of right - normed products ; we collect the nonzero coefficients of those in the columns of the following table : @xmath457    if the right - normed products are linearly independent , those expressions must coincide .",
    "the grbner basis for the corresponding system of polynomial equations is @xmath458 this implies that every solution to this system has @xmath459 , @xmath460 , @xmath461 , @xmath462 , and @xmath463 , so the only solutions are @xmath464 , which is the left - nilpotent operad , @xmath465 , which is the associative operad , @xmath466 , which is the zinbiel operad , and @xmath467 , which is the leibniz operad .",
    "[ bignumbers ] proposition [ x_5x_6zero ] shows that if we wish to find new regular solutions we will have to consider the more difficult cases in which either @xmath468 or @xmath469 is nonzero . in these cases ,",
    "lemma [ sizeblemma ] shows that @xmath212 has size either 30 or 36 . for regularity",
    "we require that @xmath212 has nullity 24 , and hence its rank must be 6 or 12 respectively . in order to study size 30 matrices of rank 6 using determinantal ideals , we must compute all the minors of sizes 6 and 7 , the total numbers of which are already impractical , and for the minors of sizes 12 and 13 in a matrix of size 36 , the numbers are much larger :    @xmath470    such computations are obviously not feasible even with the best hardware and software available at present or in the foreseeable future .",
    "we therefore need to introduce some more powerful techniques in order to break down these computations into much smaller pieces , and that is the topic of the next section .",
    "because of the symmetric group actions on the components of any operad , it is to be expected that representation theory of symmetric groups can be utilized in operad theory . for an operad presented as a quotient of a free operad ,",
    "the @xmath13-th component of the ideal of relations is an @xmath14-submodule of the direct sum of a finite number of copies of the regular @xmath14-module , @xmath19 . in simplest terms , the motivation for using representation theory is to `` divide and conquer '' : to split one large intractable problem into a number of smaller tractable pieces which are collectively equivalent to the original problem .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a systematic development of the necessary material using modern notation and terminology .",
    "there are two significant advantages to using the representation theory of the symmetric group to study algebraic operads .",
    "we have already mentioned the first : this method allows us to study a set of multilinear relations `` one representation at a time '' , which greatly reduces the sizes of the matrices involved .",
    "the second important reason is that using representation theory allows us to specify beforehand the @xmath14-module structure of the space of relations , not only its dimension , and this can save a great deal of further computation .",
    "for example , the regular @xmath48-module @xmath471 has dimension 24 , but there are other @xmath48-modules of dimension 24 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath472 are the multiplicities of the simple modules @xmath473,[31],[2",

    "if we restrict further to modules @xmath474 which are symmetric in the sense that @xmath482 \\cong t$ ] where @xmath483 $ ] is the sign module , or equivalently @xmath484 , @xmath485 , then the number of solutions decreases to a more manageable 21 .    without representation theory ,",
    "if we encounter a module of dimension 24 , we have to determine its structure by computing the traces of the representation matrices for a set of conjugacy class representatives and then using the character table of @xmath48 to express the character as a linear combination ( with non - negative integer coefficients ) of the simple characters .",
    "with representation theory , this extra work is unnecessary .",
    "when the characteristic of @xmath31 is 0 or @xmath486 , the group algebra @xmath19 is semisimple , and the classical structure theory applies .",
    "let @xmath487 range over the partitions of @xmath13 ; we write @xmath488 for the number of partitions .",
    "the regular module @xmath19 decomposes into the ( orthogonal ) direct sum of simple two - sided ideals @xmath489 , each of which is isomorphic to a full matrix algebra @xmath490 , where @xmath491 is the dimension of the simple @xmath14-module @xmath492 $ ] : @xmath493 as a right ( or left ) ideal @xmath489 decomposes as the direct sum of @xmath494 copies of @xmath492 $ ] which correspond to the rows ( or columns ) of @xmath490 .",
    "efficient algorithms are known for computing the isomorphism in both directions ; see @xcite .",
    "we will only require the projections which take a partition @xmath487 and a permutation @xmath495 and produce the matrix @xmath496 which represents the action of @xmath495 on @xmath492 $ ] .",
    "the simplest algorithm for computing the matrices @xmath497 was discovered by clifton @xcite .",
    "the isomorphism expresses @xmath19 , a single vector space of dimension @xmath498 , as the direct sum of @xmath488 subspaces of dimensions @xmath499 , and these subspaces are orthogonal in the sense that @xmath500 if @xmath501 and @xmath502 with @xmath503 .",
    "thus we have divided the original structure of size @xmath498 into a list of @xmath488 independent structures of average size @xmath504 .",
    "but we have also converted the vector space @xmath19 ( a tensor of rank 1 ) into a list of @xmath488 full matrix algebras ( tensors of rank 2 ) .",
    "thus the original problem has decomposed into @xmath488 problems of size @xmath505 , which is the average dimension of a simple @xmath14-module .      to see how",
