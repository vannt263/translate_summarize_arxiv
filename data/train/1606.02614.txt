    "nucleon and nuclear structure functions as measured in inclusive electron scattering have proven to be very useful in probing the fundamental , underlying quark dynamics .",
    "nucleon scattering experiments at high energy have been conducted over a wide kinematic range at various experimental facilities such as slac , desy , cern , jefferson lab ; see for instance refs .",
    "the data obtained from these experiments have helped develop the description of hadrons as composite objects of quarks and gluons which interact weakly at large energy scales but very strongly at low energy scales . at large enough values of the square of the four  momentum transfer , @xmath3 , corresponding to small wavelengths of the virtual photon probe , the lepton ",
    "nucleon interaction can be viewed as the incoherent scattering of the virtual photon from a single quark .",
    "the experimental results can be interpreted in the framework of perturbative qcd in terms of single parton densities . however , as @xmath3 decreases , the description of the nucleon s structure becomes more complex , and initial and final state interactions between the struck quark and the remnants of the target must be included .",
    "the transition from perturbative to non  perturbative qcd is of great interest as it involves the fundamental dynamics of bound matter , which is not yet well understood .",
    "the kinematics for the inclusive electron ",
    "proton scattering process can be described in the one  photon exchange approximation in terms of the square of the four  momentum transfer ( @xmath5 , the virtuality of the photon ) , and the bjorken scaling variable @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the energy in the target rest frame of the virtual photon exchanged , @xmath8 is the proton mass , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the incident and scattered electron energies , respectively . in this case",
    "the differential cross section for inclusive unpolarized electron scattering can be written as :    @xmath11    here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the longitudinal and transverse virtual photon absorption cross sections , respectively , and @xmath14 is the transverse virtual photon flux factor , @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the relative longitudinal virtual photon polarization and @xmath17 is the fine structure function .",

    " zero value for @xmath27 at bjorken @xmath28 and large four - momentum transfer squared ( @xmath29  gev@xmath1 ) .",
    "these results have sparked renewed theoretical and experimental interest in this structure function ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "typically , the ratio of longitudinal and transverse virtual photon absorption cross sections , @xmath4 , is measured to determine @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath4 is defined as :    @xmath30    this ratio is expected to vanish at large @xmath3 and moderate @xmath26 for scattering from spin1/2 pointlike partons , but is nonzero ( of the order of 0.1 to 0.3  @xcite ) at low values of @xmath3 and moderate @xmath26 due in part to the fact that quarks can carry transverse momentum .",
    "determining separately the longitudinal and transverse structure functions , @xmath27 and @xmath19 , and thus the ratio @xmath4 , is experimentally challenging .",
    "it may be achieved via a rosenbluth  type separation technique  @xcite , using eq .",
    "(  [ eq : xsect1 ] ) .",
    "this procedure requires high - precision cross - section measurements at the same @xmath26 and @xmath3 but different values of @xmath16 , which requires in turn measurements at a minimum of two different incident beam energies and scattering angles  @xcite .",
    "consequently there are far fewer experimental data available for @xmath31 , and @xmath4 than for the structure function @xmath20 .",
    "measured separated structure functions for the neutron , usually extracted from deuterium data due to the lack of a free neutron target in nature , are even fewer than those for hydrogen .",
    "most of the existing deuterium measurements were performed at large four - momentum transfer and do not show significant differences compared to hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "this could be due , however , to @xmath4 itself being quite small at these kinematics , such that any differences may be buried in the measurement uncertainties .",
    "measurements of @xmath4 at jefferson lab  @xcite in the low @xmath3 regime , where @xmath4 is larger and differences may appear , show a slight difference between hydrogen and deuterium .",
    "this is somewhat unexpected , but not in contradiction with theoretical predictions .",
    "there is no requirement in perturbative qcd for @xmath4 to be the same for the proton and the neutron .",
    "while hadron helicity conservation requires that both must go to zero at large @xmath3 , there is no requirement that finite@xmath3 corrections / values be identical .",
    "however , it is generally assumed that @xmath32 and that higher twist corrections are identical , e.g. in the extraction of neutron structure function @xmath20 from measurements on the deuteron and proton  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "experiment e00002 was carried out at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jefferson lab or jlab ) in hall c. the kinematic range covered was @xmath33  gev@xmath1 and @xmath34 .",
    "proton and electron  deuteron cross sections were measured using four incident electron beam energies ( 2.24 , 3.04 , 4.41 , and 5.50  gev ) .",
    "the experiment utilized the high luminosity , continuous wave ( cw ) electron beam provided by the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) . to minimize systematic uncertainties ,",
    "the beam current was kept within a few @xmath35 of the 40  @xmath35nominal value .",
    "the cryogenic targets used were 4cm long hydrogen ( h ) and deuterium ( d ) `` tuna can''shaped aluminum cells .",
    "the cryogenic target walls were 0.125  mm thick .",
    "the target assembly , described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , also included an aluminum `` dummy target '' that was used for background measurements and subtraction .",
    "precise cross section measurements require accurate knowledge of target thickness and target density .",
    "due to the circular geometry of the cryogenic target cell the effective target length seen by the beam depended upon both the central position of the beam spot and the size and form of the beam raster pattern .",
    "the effective target length was determined for jefferson lab experiment e00116 which ran during the same period and details of the analysis are presented in  @xcite .",
    "density fluctuation studies for the target cells and the beam currents used in this experiment are presented in various publications ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and amount to @xmath36  @xmath35 .",
    "the basic equipment in hall c at jefferson lab consists of two magnetic spectrometers : the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) and the short orbit spectrometer ( sos ) .",
    "the hms was used to detect the scattered electrons , while the sos was used for detecting positrons which were used to estimate the electron background originating from charge ",
    "symmetric processes , such as @xmath37 production and subsequent pair symmetric decay .",
    "the data were taken at hms angles varying from 11@xmath38 to 50@xmath38 .",
    "the hms is a magnetic spectrometer consisting of a 25@xmath38 vertical bend dipole magnet for momentum dispersion and three quadrupole magnets for focusing . for this experiment",
    "the hms was operated in point  to  point optical tune .",
    "the hms solid angle is defined mainly by the octagonal collimator and is 6.8  msr .",
    "the hms momentum acceptance was @xmath39 while the angular acceptance was @xmath40  mrad .",
    "the sos was a resistive @xmath41 magnetic spectrometer with a 9  msr solid angle .",
    "the sos momentum acceptance was @xmath42 to @xmath43 while the angular acceptance was @xmath44  mrad .",
    "the hms and sos detector packages were very similar consisting of two drift chambers for track reconstruction ( the hms drift chambers are described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , scintillator arrays for triggering , and a threshold gas erenkov and electromagnetic calorimeters  @xcite , which were both used in the present experiment for particle identification and pion rejection .",
    "more details on the two spectrometers and their detector packages can be found in refs .",
    "the inclusive double differential cross section for each energy and angle bin within the spectrometer acceptance was determined from    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the bin width in solid angle ( scattered electron energy ) , @xmath47 is the total integrated luminosity , and @xmath48 is the measured electron yield after accounting for detector inefficiencies , background events mentioned before , and radiative corrections . to obtain the born cross section ( the leading order , one photon exchange contribution ) the measured yield has to be corrected for the higher order electromagnetic processes which contribute to the inclusive electron  nucleon scattering .",
    "these radiative processes can be divided into two main categories : internal , which originate due to the fields of the particles at the scattering vertex ( vacuum polarization , vertex corrections , two - photon exchange , and bremsstrahlung emission in the field of the proton from which the scattering took place ) , and external , which originate due to the fields of particles in the bulk target materials ( processes that occur either before or after the primary scattering vertex ) .",
    "the radiative correction factors , which account for these higher order processes , were evaluated using the same procedure used in various jefferson lab analyses ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) and which is based originally on the mo and tsai prescription  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in the radiative correction procedure were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and were estimated to be 0.5% point  to  point and 1.0% normalized .    for every bin in scattering angle and scattered electron energy",
    "the cross section was corrected for the variation of the cross section over the acceptance with the angle @xmath49 ( bin  centering correction ) and for radiative effects to yield the value of the cross section at the central angle .",
    "the radiative effects strongly depend on the kinematics . to minimize the dependence on the model  @xcite used to compute both",
    "the bin  centering correction and the radiative effects , an iterative procedure was employed .",
    "corrected data were fit to obtain new parameters for the model used , and new corrections were calculated .",
    "these steps were repeated until the fit parameters converged .",
    "statistical and systematic uncertainties for the cross section were at most @xmath503.5% .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty in the differential cross section was taken as the quadratic sum of all the systematic uncertainties contributing to the cross section measurement . the total systematic uncertainty not including the one from the radiative corrections varies per kinematic bin between 1.19% and 1.43% ( see table  i ) .",
    "the extraction of the longitudinal structure function was accomplished via the rosenbluth technique , where measurements are made for two or more values of @xmath16 at fixed bjorken @xmath26 and @xmath3 , and the reduced cross section is fit linearly as a function of @xmath16 , as in eq.([eq : xsect1 ] ) .",
    "since even after all corrections are applied the data at various @xmath16 are not at the exact same @xmath26 and @xmath3 as needed for the rosenbluth separation method , the data were interpolated toward a common @xmath26 and @xmath3 using the cross section parameterization  @xcite .    in a rosenbluth separation",
    "one needs to distinguish between uncertainties that are correlated between measurements at different @xmath16 , such as uncertainties in target thickness and integrated charge , and uncorrelated ones such as spectrometer acceptance or background subtraction at different angles .",
    "not including the contributions from radiative corrections , the uncorrelated systematic uncertainties in the cross - section measurements in this experiment amounted to @xmath500.88% .",

    "the data are a weighted average over @xmath26 of data beyond the nucleon resonance region , @xmath52 2 gev .",
    "there is a systematic overall shift of the data towards negative values , indicating that below @xmath53  gev@xmath1 @xmath4 for the deuteron might be smaller than that for the proton . for this kinematic range a weighted average of all available data , including the new e00002 data , yields @xmath54 for @xmath55  gev@xmath1 , in agreement with the result obtained by a similar global average presented in  @xcite , which did not include the present data and obtained @xmath56 .",
    "while this difference is a small quantity , it should be noted that the value of @xmath4 in this region is only on average 0.1 .",
    "hence , this is a @xmath57% effect .",
    "it is useful to note that there may be some @xmath26 dependence to these data as well .",
    "it would be reasonable , for instance , for any longitudinal emc effect in deuterium to have some @xmath26 dependence in this kinematic regime given that the cross section has a well  known @xmath26dependence .     and",
    "@xmath58 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "]    although there is nothing to prevent it , there is no theoretical model that predicts the neutron structure function ratio @xmath59 to differ from the proton @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , in most previous analyses , @xmath58 was assumed to equal @xmath60 , thus neglecting possible nuclear binding or emc  effect type phenomena in the deuteron  or an inherent difference between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "previous measurements had , moreover , generally confirmed no difference , i.e. @xmath61  @xcite for @xmath62  gev@xmath1 . however , in the high momentum domain of these measurements , @xmath63 and any difference is practically immeasurable at large @xmath3 values .",
    "this fact may resolve the apparent discrepancy between the higher @xmath3 results and the results shown here . in the framework of the leading - twist formalism",
    ", global qcd fits to available nuclear data allow for enhancements of valence - quark and gluon distributions in nuclei as compared to a free proton  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 structure function would be uniquely sensitive to such an enhanced gluon distribution  @xcite . to investigate this possibility we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] the structure function @xmath64 as a function of @xmath3 .",

    "in conclusion , we report new separated structure function measurements for hydrogen and deuterium at low @xmath3 ( below 2  gev@xmath1 ) .",
    "available parameterizations and theoretical predictions for the longitudinal structure - function @xmath27 agree reasonably well when extrapolated to the low @xmath3 ( as low as @xmath69  gev@xmath1 ) and large @xmath26 ( @xmath70 ) kinematics of these new data . remarkably , the global data set seems to smoothly converge toward zero below @xmath71  gev@xmath1 , even while it is still far above the current conservation limit .",
    "additionally , the deuterium data seem to confirm a smaller ratio @xmath72 than the hydrogen data and therefore indicate either a nuclear dependence to the longitudinal response of the nucleons in the deuteron , and hence a nuclear dependence to the @xmath27 structure function , or a difference between the neutron and proton @xmath27 structure functions .",
