    "similarly , loncharich , brooks and pastor explored the effects of the langevin friction constant on transitions rates in the larger `` nama '' molecule with an eye toward speeding up the generation of conformational ensembles in peptides and proteins @xcite .",
    "work in one - dimensional systems , in addition to considering the effects of stochastic dynamics on reaction rates ( e.g. , @xcite ) , has explored transition phenomena on still - shorter `` microscopic '' timescales .",

    "the present authors previously considered the influence of the local , non - uniform speed along the reaction coordinate on a `` dynamic importance sampling '' approach to rate computations @xcite .",
    "many `` microscopic '' questions have remained unanswered regarding _ molecular _ transition events .",
    "what is their duration ? is the reaction coordinate traversed at a uniform speed , or is progress more rapid in some regions ?    is there sensitivity to the choice of dynamics or potential ?",
    "the need for detailed answers is more pressing in molecular systems because dynamic importance sampling @xcite and `` transition path sampling '' methods @xcite for computing reaction rates require ensembles of transition event trajectories .",
    "a quantitative understanding of transition events could accelerate ensemble generation in these approaches , making larger systems amenable to study .",
    "moreover , because ensembles of transition events are required for rate estimates , the durations set a fundamental minimum on the computer time required to perform such calculations @xcite .",

    "the butane molecule was lightly restrained to the center of the simulation cell using a harmonic , molecule - specific , center - of - mass energy term .",

    "@xcite and also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - cross ] .    because even the langevin butane simulations  _ which were performed with white noise _",

    "( [ brown - sim ] ) that atom moves based on the force it feels and a white noise increment .",
    "the force itself , however , reflects the relatively long - timescale motions executed by the whole molecule .",
    "hence the molecule acts as its own memory , and correlations are not surprising regardless of the type of noise modeled in @xmath29 .",
    "by comparing butane simulations with explicit and implicit solvents , along with simple white- and colored - noise one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , we have found a remarkable degree of commonality in short - timescale kinetic properties .",
    "the distributions of transition - event durations @xmath57 _ from all systems studied _ substantially `` collapse '' onto a single universal function after a simple linear rescaling ( fig .",

    "furthermore , qualitatively match those from 1d colored - noise systems , but are clearly distinct from the 1d white - noise behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - cross ] ) .    despite this universal short - time behavior , quantitative estimates for reaction - rate , correlation , and event - duration timescales ( table [ tab : timescales ] ) reveals no obvious relationship between butane systems with explicit solvents and those with implicit , stochastic `` solvent . ''",
    "this suggests that stochastic simulations , at least at the level considered here , can not be used for quantitative estimates of timescales in fully - solvated computations . while this assessment may be more pessimistic than that of widmalm and pastor @xcite ,",
    "it is not surprising that consideration of an additional timescale , namely @xmath57 , makes agreement more difficult .",
    "perhaps more important are two other issues : do simple stochastic representations become better or worse as larger molecules are considered ?",
    "what quantity of explicit solvent , say in combination with stochastic boundary conditions @xcite , provides a good level of agreement with the array of kinetic quantities in fully - solvated systems ?",
    "further theoretical consideration of the connection between simple and molecular systems would also prove valuable .",
    "in particular , the study of simple models possessing a one - dimensional reaction coordinate coupled nontrivially to simple orthogonal degrees of freedom ( based on , e.g. , @xcite ) should permit a better understanding of the effects of noise color on the short - time transition behavior considered here . in a molecular system , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : profiles ] , the effective noise on any atom _ must _ be colored because of the coupling to the non - trivial `` bath '' of other particles .",
    "following up on the motivation for the investigation reported here , we believe that an appreciation of the results can inform improved sampling approaches for reaction rate computations within the `` transition path sampling '' @xcite and `` dynamic importance sampling '' @xcite methods .",
    "these approaches require ensembles of transition - event trajectories . at",
    "a simple level , understanding the transition event duration @xmath57 in molecular systems is critical : as noted in @xcite , the duration of molecular crossing events sets , in part , the minimum computation time required to generate a realistic ensemble of transition - event trajectories .",
    "furthermore , given the universal behavior uncovered here , stochastic simulations evidently reproduce key aspects of explicitly - solvated transition behavior . despite the clear importance of solvent effects , this study suggests that trajectories harvested in a computationally inexpensive stochastic context should  at a minimum  provide good starting points for refinement in a solvated context .",
