    "in part i of this paper @xcite a modified bcs mechanism of cooper pair formation was proposed that operates in narrow `` superconducting '' energy bands ( @xmath0 bands ) and can be established within a nonadiabatic extension of the heisenberg model of magnetism @xcite .",
    "this `` nonadiabatic heisenberg model '' ( nhm ) is defined by three postulates given , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the present paper gives a physical interpretation of this mechanism . in section [ sec:1 ] the special properties of the spin - dependent wannier functions ( spin - dependent wfs ) in narrow @xmath0 bands",
    "are interpreted in terms of spin - flipping processes . in sections",
    "[ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] the spin - phonon coupling in narrow @xmath0 bands and the resulting mechanism of cooper pair formation , respectively , are illustrated in terms of these spin processes .    in section [ sec:4 ] the important difference between the new mechanism in narrow @xmath0 bands and the conventional bcs mechanism @xcite",
    "is interpreted in terms of `` spring - mounted '' cooper pairs .",
    "assume a metal to be given that possesses a narrow , roughly half - filled @xmath0-band complex in its calculated band structure .",
    "as in part i we assume that this metal has only one atom in the unit cell .",
    "that means that the @xmath0-band complex consists only of a single @xmath0 band .",
    "the bloch functions of the @xmath0 band can be transformed into spin - dependent wfs @xmath1 [ as given in eq .",
    "( a14 ) of part i ] with the following properties :    \\(i ) they are centered on the atomic positions @xmath2 ;    \\(ii ) they are obtained by a _ unitary _ transformation from the bloch functions of the @xmath0 band ;    \\(iii ) they are adapted to the symmetry of the considered metal ; and    \\(iv ) they are as well localized as possible .",
    "( @xmath3 is the quantum number of the crystal spin ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for the local and spin coordinate , respectively , of the electron . )",
    "however , the spin - dependent wfs can not be written as a product of a local function @xmath6 with the spin functions @xmath7",
    "( @xmath8 denotes the spin quantum number ) because the matrix @xmath9 $ ] in eq .",
    "( a9 ) of can not be chosen independent of @xmath10 in a @xmath0 band .",
    "thus , these functions represent localized states @xmath11 with spin directions depending on the positions @xmath4 of the electrons .",
    "this motion may be described in terms of `` spin - flipping processes '' as , e.g. , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . here",
    "two electrons with parallel spins align their spins antiparallel when they approach within the region of overlap .",
    "band : two electrons with parallel spins ( represented by small circles @xmath12 ) in adjacent localized states comply with the pauli principle by aligning their spins antiparallel when they approach . ]",
    "it is essential that within the nhm the states @xmath13 are _ really occupied by electrons_. this is a consequence of the second postulate of the nhm , i.e. , of the special electron - electron interaction in the nonadiabatic system which is forced by this postulate .",
    "hence , within the nhm the spin - flipping processes in a narrow @xmath0 band are produced by a _",
    "real electron - electron interaction _ that operates in the nonadiabatic system .",
    "the flippings of the spins are a consequence of the special mathematical properties of the spin - dependent wfs @xmath1 which are determined by the four above conditions ( i ) - ( iv ) that must be satisfied within the nhm . hence , we understand the physical character of this interaction if we understand why the @xmath1 must comply with these conditions .    the first and the fourth condition ( i ) and ( iv ) are required by the second postulate .",
    "hence , these conditions allow the electrons to take the state of lowest coulomb repulsion energy .",
    "the second condition ( ii ) yields a nonadiabatic hamiltonian with the correct symmetry and the third condition ( iii ) guarantees that the spin - dependent wfs are orthogonal .",
    "hence , the third condition is required that electrons occupying the states @xmath13 comply with the pauli principle .",
    "consequently , in the ground state of a narrow @xmath0 band _ the electrons change permanently their spin directions in order to comply with the pauli principle . _",
    "in a narrow @xmath0 band , the operator @xmath14 of coulomb interaction has the rather complicated form given in eq .",
    "( 3.13 ) of part i. @xmath14 depends on boson as well as on fermion operators and represents a special `` spin - phonon interaction '' which may be understood as follows .    on a spin - flipping process as indicated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] the spin angular momentum of the two electrons is not conserved . during this process",
    "the electrons behave like gyroscopes : inertial forces act on the electrons that deform their orbitals within their localized states . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , the localized charge distributions become asymmetric with respect to the lattice and accelerate the positive ions in such a way that phonons are emitted or absorbed . eq .  ( 3.14 ) of part i shows that @xmath14 conserves the total crystal spin angular momentum .     produces asymmetric charge distributions that accelerate the positive ions in such a way that a phonon pair is emitted or absorbed .",
    "@xmath15 stands for the acceleration of the positive ions . ]",
    "as a consequence of the spin - phonon coupling in a narrow @xmath0 band , crystal - spin-1 phonons are excited in the ground state of the nonadiabatic system .",
    "we may assume that at zero temperature these phonons are virtually excited , i.e. , each phonon pair is reabsorbed immediately after its generation .",
    "in part i we approximated the nonadiabatic hamiltonian by a purely electronic hamiltonian @xmath16 in order to describe the electron - phonon system at zero temperature ; see eq .",
    "( 3.17 ) of part i.    @xmath16 satisfies the equation of constraint ( 3.36 ) in .",
    "this equation distinguishes the mechanism of cooper pair formation within the nhm from the conventional bcs mechanism . as a consequence of this equation of constraint , in _ all the eigenstates _ of @xmath16 the electrons form cooper pairs",
    "this may be understood as follows .",
    "the system represented by @xmath16 is purely electronic though the spin - flipping processes still occur .",
    "the electron spins still couple to the motion of the atomic cores and , hence , to the phonons .",
    "these phonons , however , _ can not store _ crystal spin angular momenta but must be reabsorbed immediately after their generation . in this way , the phonons mediate a special spin - spin interaction between the electrons .",
    "thus , we have to look for a state with the total spin angular momentum being conserved within the electron system _ alone_. that means , within the system represented by @xmath16 every spin - flipping process of two @xmath0-band",
    "electrons must be accompanied by the opposite flipping process of two other @xmath0-band electrons .",
    "this opposite process may occur somewhere in the crystal since the electron spins interact via virtual crystal - spin-1 phonons",
    ".    in this context , `` opposite '' means `` time inverted '' because the time - inversion symmetry is the only symmetry which makes such an opposite motion possible .",
    "hence , the total spin angular momentum is conserved within the electron system if all the electrons form pairs that are invariant under time inversion .",
    "that means , whenever a certain one - electron state is occupied , then its time - inverted state must be occupied , too . in other words ,",
    "all the electrons must form cooper pairs .",
    "we obtain further information on the spin - flipping processes in a narrow @xmath0 band by transforming the operator @xmath14 of coulomb interaction into the @xmath10 representation ,      with @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for a vector of the reciprocal lattice . as already mentioned above , in addition @xmath14 conserves the crystal spin angular momentum . in bcc materials this conservation law",
    "may be expressed by the analogous equation @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an integer .",
    "the boson operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 create and annihilate phonons with wave vector @xmath10 and crystal spin @xmath24 ; the fermion operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 create and annihilate nonadiabatic bloch states with wave vector @xmath10 and crystal spin @xmath3 .",
    "remember that @xmath14 depends on boson operators because during a spin - flipping process of two electrons a phonon pair is emitted ( or absorbed ) in a narrow @xmath0 band .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) shows that these flipping processes are closely connected with scattering processes of the bloch electrons : a flipping of two spins effects a scattering of these electrons within the @xmath10 space or , vice versa , a scattering of two bloch electrons effects a flipping of the spins .",
    "the mechanism of cooper pair formation via crystal - spin-1 phonons in a narrow @xmath0 band is characterized by the equation of constraint ( 3.36 ) of part i. the physical origin of the related `` constraining forces '' may be understood as follows .",
    "assume all the @xmath27 electrons ( with @xmath27 being even ) in a narrow @xmath0 band to form ( symmetrized ) cooper pairs of the form @xmath28 cf .",
    "( 3.25 ) of part i. two of these cooper pairs are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) .",
    "the total crystal spin of each cooper pair is zero .",
    "let be @xmath29 the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the @xmath27-electron states in the @xmath0 band in which all the electrons form cooper pairs . in @xmath29",
    "the electrons possess only @xmath30 degrees of freedom because always _ two _ electrons are characterized by four quantum numbers @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( cf . section 4 of part i ) .",
    "however , the electrons can not stay in @xmath29 because in reality they have @xmath35 degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , they necessarily become scattered out of this subspace creating then a phonon pair [ satisfying eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) ] because any scattering process is connected with a flipping of the spins .",
    "band : + ( a ) four electrons form cooper pairs .",
    "the total crystal spin of each cooper pair is zero .",
    "+ ( b ) the two electrons with wave vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 are scattered on creating a phonon pair ( with wave vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "the total crystal spin of the four electrons _ and _ the two phonons is zero , while neither the four electrons nor the two phonons alone possess a defined total crystal spin .",
    "+ ( c ) the two phonons can be completely reabsorbed only by the time - inverted scattering process .",
    "hence , after the absorption of the phonons , the electrons again form cooper pairs of zero total crystal spin . ]    in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) the two electrons with the wave vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 become scattered emitting then a phonon pair with the wave vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the total crystal spin of the four electrons _ and _ the two phonons still is exactly zero ( since @xmath40 conserves the crystal spin angular momentum ) , but the phonons and electrons are strongly coupled in the sense that neither the two phonons nor the four electrons _ alone _ possess a defined total crystal spin . the strength of this coupling as well as the wave vectors of the scattered electrons and the emitted phonons strongly depend on the special features of the preceding spin - flipping process . as stated above , the spins flip in a narrow @xmath0 band in order that the localized electrons comply with the pauli principle .",
    "hence , the features of the spin - flipping processes are determined by the wave vectors of the flipping electrons as well as by the wave vectors of all the other electrons that produce the potential in which the scattered electrons move .",
    "the two phonons can not be reabsorbed spontaneously because their complete absorption can only be the result of an appropriate motion of two other electrons in the @xmath0 band .",
    "such a motion is given when these two other electrons are _",
    "forced by the pauli principle _ to change their spin directions in such a way that the phonon pair ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) is completely reabsorbed .",
    "such a motion is performed by the time - inverted electron pair ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) : these two electrons carry out exactly the time inverted flipping process leading to a complete absorption of the phonon pair .",
    "hence , after the absorption of the phonon pair the electrons again form cooper pairs with zero total crystal spin , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure3](c ) .    this mechanism may be interpreted in terms of `` spring - mounted '' cooper pairs : there exist `` springs '' in the nonadiabatic system that push the electrons back into the subspace @xmath29 .",
    "these springs become tense when phonons get excited , and they become slacken again when these phonons are reabsorbed .    the operator @xmath16 represents a system with these springs being rigid .",
    "the effect of these rigid springs may be interpreted in terms of constraining forces that produce frozen cooper pairs possessing half the degrees of freedom of unpaired electrons .    in analogy to classical physics ,",
    "i suppose that only these quantum mechanical constraining forces produced by the described `` springs '' in narrow @xmath0 bands can produce stable cooper pairs ( with half the degrees of freedom of unpaired electrons ) .",
    "this supposition is corroborated by the calculated band structures of those metals that experimentally prove to be superconductors ; see part ii of this paper @xcite ."
