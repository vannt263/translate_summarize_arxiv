    "to address the steady increase of mobile traffic , one way is to enhance the network capacity by a massive deployment of small cells .",
    "this is a solution envisaged by network operators in the framework of lte - a heterogeneous networks @xcite or ultra dense networks scenarios for future 5 g networks @xcite . in such dense networks , the amount of handover generated by users mobility will significantly increase , with a notable impact on signaling overhead . on the other hand , the average throughput of users data communications is expected to improve , due to the changing transmission conditions which allow some kind of mobility - based opportunism .    in this context , the present paper aims at evaluating the impact of _ inter - cell mobility _ on the user - perceived performance in dense networks .",
    "specifically , considering small cells enables us to neglect the possible spatial variations of intra - cell capacities and thus to focus on the impact of inter - cell mobility itself .",
    "furthermore , we decouple the performance evaluation problem from that of characterizing a geometric user displacement model .",
    "the latter topic is out of scope of the present paper ( see @xcite and references therein for a review of current methods and , in particular , @xcite for the random waypoint ( rw ) model ) .",
    "mobility is here supposed to be captured through the distribution of the users residual sojourn time in a cell , i.e. , the time a mobile user is physically present in the cell once its transmission has started ; this distribution may be the output of user displacement models . given this distribution , we construct a flow - level queuing model that allows us to derive the essential performance metrics in each cell , namely the mean throughput and the handover probability . in the case of a homogeneous network ,",
    "our approach enables us to reduce the analysis of the network performance to that of a single representative cell . besides",
    ", an approximate model is derived in order to replace the exact markovian model when the latter suffers from scalability impairments .    in the literature , performance gains induced by mobility in cellular networks",
    "are generally related to the spatial variations of capacity inside the cells , which permits some opportunistic use of favorable transmission conditions by mobile users @xcite .",
    "these papers also base their evaluation on flow - level traffic modeling but address mobility through a spatial markov process where users jump between distinct capacity zones in the cells . in @xcite ,",
    "the average throughputs of different classes of users are estimated through upper and lower bounds associated with fluid limits and quasi - stationary regimes , respectively . by means of an approximate model",
    ", @xcite computes the mean flow throughput of a single class of users , reporting on a throughput gain created by intra- and inter - cell mobility altogether . in a complementary way , @xcite focuses on the characterization of network capacity with different scenarios of intra - cell and inter - cell mobility .",
    "generalizing a study on a single cell in isolation @xcite , our paper is to our knowledge the first attempt to focus on the multi - class throughput gains induced by inter - cell mobility alone , and also to provide a method to estimate the handover rate , a key performance parameter which counterbalances the throughput improvement . in the following",
    ", section [ sec : models ] presents our approach to model networks with mobility .",
    "a generic one - cell markovian model is constructed in section [ sec : markovmod ] to derive the main performance indicators ; a heuristic quasi - stationary approximation is then proposed to alleviate computation .",
    "finally , the approach is validated for homogeneous networks through simulation and numerical experiments in sections [ sec : numres]-[sec : discuss ] .",
    "consider a cellular network of @xmath0 cells with possibly distinct capacities .",
    "users from @xmath1 traffic classes may appear and move during their communications .",
    "when leaving a cell during transmission , users join one of the neighboring cells according to some routing probabilities .",
    "they consequently generate supplementary flows of new arrivals , hereafter called _ handover arrivals _ , which are to be added to _ fresh arrivals _ in each cell .",
    "we assume that class-@xmath2 users generate requests for transmission in cell @xmath3 according to a poisson process with rate @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ; this corresponds to the fresh traffic offered to cell @xmath3 . to account for class-@xmath2 users that became active outside cell @xmath3 and experienced one or more handovers , the total flow arrival to cell @xmath3",
    "is written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the handover call arrival rate from neighboring cells .",
    "for all @xmath3 and @xmath2 , we will assume that the handover process to cell @xmath3 from class-@xmath2 users can be approximated by a poisson process so that it can be superposed to the fresh arrivals to build up a total poisson arrival process with rate @xmath9 given in ( [ flow0 ] ) .",
    "all poisson processes introduced above are assumed to be mutually independent .",
    "the latter is a fundamental assumption in our modeling approach , which allows a local description of the traffic flows at each cell as explained below .",
    "this notably simplifies the global description of the overall multi - class multi - cell process , as handled in @xcite .",
    "[ sec : fxpt ]      the handover arrival rate @xmath8 to cell @xmath3 results from the superposition of handovers departing from neighboring cells according to routing probabilities @xmath10 from cell @xmath11 to cell @xmath3 for class-@xmath2 users .",
    "we can write the flow equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the handover departure rate from cell @xmath14 emanating from class @xmath2-users .",
    "rate @xmath13 can in turn be considered as an output of a queuing model for cell @xmath14 and calculated by means of some _ performance function _ @xmath15 , that is , @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath6 . in ( [ flow2 ] ) , only handover arrival rates are considered as variables , all other intrinsic parameters ( such as cell capacities , per - class offered traffic and mobility rates introduced below ) being kept constant . from ( [ flow1])-([flow2 ] ) , it follows that a stationary network regime can be characterized by a system of @xmath18 equilibrium equations with unknowns , the handover arrival rates @xmath8 , namely @xmath19 the problem of existence and uniqueness of a solution to the non - linear system ( [ eq : fixedpoint_heter ] ) is out of scope of the present paper . as the performance functions @xmath20 may not be explicitly determined in terms of input parameters , the practical determination of a solution to ( [ eq : fixedpoint_heter ] ) generally involves a numerical iterative procedure , e.g. a fixed - point algorithm .",
    "now assume that the network consists in _ homogeneous cells _ in the following sense :    * all intrinsic parameters ( capacities , arrival rates , ... ) are the same for all cells , so that performance functions do not depend on the cell index , that is , @xmath21 ; * handover routing is homogeneous , i.e. , for each class @xmath2 , cell @xmath3 receives handover traffic from a set @xmath22 of neighboring cells with identical probability @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the common cardinal of sets @xmath22 .    clearly , any solution to the simpler system @xmath25 will provide a particular solution to ( [ eq : fixedpoint_heter ] ) , hence _",

    ", the problem thus reduces to the study of a single cell , hereafter called the _",
    "representative cell_. system ( [ eq : fixedpoint_onecell ] ) expresses the fact that the outgoing handover traffic is fed back in a balanced way as a supplementary traffic to the ingress of this cell .",
    "we consider a single cell whose performance model may be used as the generic tool to provide performance equations ( [ flow2 ] ) or ( [ eq : fixedpoint_onecell ] ) for a heterogeneous or homogeneous network , respectively ( we thus drop the cell index @xmath3 in all notation ) .",
    "the considered cell is supposed to be `` small '' , i.e. , of limited range so that its transmission capacity @xmath26 can be assumed spatially constant ( this capacity is viewed as an input parameter accounting for radio and interference conditions in the considered cellular network ) .",
    "we handle downlink traffic only and suppose that capacity @xmath26 is equally shared among all active users present in its service area ( this can be implemented by means of a round - robin discipline ) . following this fair sharing policy , the system occupancy ( number of active transmissions at any time ) can then be modeled by a processor - sharing ( ps ) queue @xcite .",
    "class-@xmath2 users have i.i.d .",
    "transmission requests of data volume @xmath27 with mean @xmath28 , hence a service rate @xmath29 .",
    "we call @xmath30 the _ remaining _ sojourn time of a mobile user , i.e. , the time duration he physically stays in the cell after the transmission has started .",
    "we finally denote by @xmath31 the mean cell departure rate of class-@xmath2 users , called class-@xmath2 _ mobility rate _ ; any class @xmath2 where @xmath32 will be called _",
    "static_.    given this setting , the occupation state of the considered cell can be described by the multi - dimensional random process @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of ongoing class-@xmath2 data transfers in the cell at time @xmath35 .",
    "the evolution of this process is represented by a processor - sharing queue with impatience @xcite , the `` impatient '' customers here corresponding to mobile users that may leave the system before their service completion .",
    "we further assume that @xmath27 and @xmath30 are exponentially distributed with parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "process @xmath38 is then markovian in @xmath39 ; from state @xmath40 and for @xmath41 with 1 corresponding to the @xmath2-th component , we can reach state @xmath42 with transition rate @xmath43 , or state @xmath44 with transition rate @xmath45 if @xmath46 , @xmath47 denoting the total number of active users .",
    "* _ let @xmath48 be the offered load of class @xmath2 .",

    "* @xmath49 * _ where @xmath50 is the set of static user classes . _ * [ stability ]    see proof in appendix [ sim ] .",
    "note that stability condition ( [ eq : stabcond ] ) does not depend on the traffic intensity of mobile ( i.e. , impatient ) users ; this is intuitively clear since the latter always leave the cell after a finite time and therefore can not cause a system overload .",
    "now , given ( [ eq : stabcond ] ) , the equilibrium equations of process @xmath38 in stationary regime can be written as    @xmath51 \\pi ( \\mathbf{n } ) = \\sum_{k=1}^k \\lambda_k \\ , \\pi ( \\mathbf{n } - \\mathbf{e}_k ) \\ ; + \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sum_{k=1}^k ( n_k   + 1 ) \\left ( \\frac{\\mu_k}{l(\\mathbf{n } ) + 1 } + \\theta_k \\right ) \\pi ( \\mathbf{n } + \\mathbf{e}_k ) , \\label{eq : global_balance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . for given @xmath2 , multiplying each equation of ( [ eq : global_balance ] ) by @xmath54 and then summing over all state vectors @xmath55 provides the following relation .    * _ for any class @xmath2 , the average arrival and departure rates verify the conservation law _ * @xmath56    clearly , process @xmath38 is not reversible unless all classes are static ; its stationary distribution @xmath57 is thus not amenable to a simple closed form .",
    "we can nevertheless evaluate this distribution by solving system ( [ eq : global_balance ] ) numerically and derive the performance indicators of interest .",
    "we first calculate the average throughput @xmath58 of a class-@xmath2 user .",
    "since mobile users may transfer only a part @xmath59 of their total data volume @xmath27 during their sojourn in the cell , their average throughput may be evaluated as follows . by little s law",
    ", @xmath60 is the mean time to transfer the average volume @xmath61 hence @xmath62 the average transferred volume @xmath61 is not directly computable from distribution @xmath57 .",
    "we can nevertheless observe that @xmath63 represents the _ carried _ traffic intensity for class @xmath2 ; in a way similar to the derivation of little s formula , this traffic intensity can be shown to equal the mean bandwidth @xmath64 allocated to class-@xmath2 users , so that ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) eventually reads @xmath65 which involves the distribution @xmath57 of @xmath66 only .",
    "we similarly define the _ handover probability _ for class-@xmath2 users as the proportion of users that exit the cell before the completion of their transmission , that is , @xmath67    using conservation law ( [ eq : conserv_law ] ) in conjunction with definitions ( [ eq : gammak ] ) and ( [ eq : hk ] ) readily yields the following property , which clearly shows the close relationship between the average throughput and the handover probability ( except for classes of static customers where @xmath32 and @xmath68 , obviously ) .",
    "* _ for any class @xmath2 , the handover probability @xmath69 and the average throughput @xmath58 are related by _ * @xmath70 [ c1 ]    in the rest of the paper , we will concentrate on the essential case of two traffic classes , static users ( with class index `` @xmath50 '' ) and mobile users ( with index `` @xmath71 '' ) .",
    "we thus set @xmath72 , @xmath73 and define loads @xmath74",
    ", @xmath75 .",
    "although the markovian model can be numerically solved , it does not lend itself to explicit expressions for performance indicators . to circumvent the explosive computation time of both the simulation and the numerical resolution of balance equations , we now develop an approximation framework suitable for the previous two - class scenario .",
    "note that an asymptotic for the reneging probability ( equivalent to our handover probability ) in a multiclass processor sharing system with impatience has been provided in @xcite , although in a heavy loaded cell with mobile users only .",
    "the underlying idea for the proposed approximation is a quasi - stationary ( qs ) assumption .",
    "first , consider that the largest the load , the highest tendency of mobile users to leave the cell before the end of their transmission .",
    "the stationary distribution of their number might thus be approximated by that of a queuing system without any constraint , i.e. , a poisson distribution describing the occupancy of an m / g/@xmath76 queue .",
    "the mean value @xmath77 of this poisson distribution remains to be evaluated .",
    "now , given a number @xmath78 of mobile users in the cell , we assume it to remain constant in time ( _ quasi - stationary _ ) so that the number @xmath79 of static users evolves in a queue with @xmath78 permanent users .",
    "this enables us to obtain the conditional distribution of @xmath79 , given @xmath80 , thence the joint distribution @xmath81 of the pair @xmath82 and all performance indicators of interest .",
    "this first step , however , does not provide accurate enough values for these indicators ( in particular , @xmath83 ) when comparing them to that of the exact markovian model . we thus iterate the qs approximation scheme by fixing now the prior distribution of @xmath79 from the first step estimation @xmath84 obtained earlier ; given @xmath85 , we similarly applies the quasi - stationary assumption to @xmath86 so as to obtain a second step estimation for the joint distribution @xmath87 of @xmath82 and the corresponding evaluation of performance indicators . at this stage ,",
    "the latter evaluations indeed provide more accurate results ( see sections [ sec / app_valqs ] and [ sec : discuss ] ) than that obtained at the first step of the approximation .",
    "it has been observed that further iterations of this qs scheme do not bring better accuracy .",

    "this section aims at validating the robustness of the proposed approach ; to do this , we will distinguish    * the _ impatience model _ ( i m ) consisting in the markovian model analyzed in section [ sec : markovmod ] , where the arrival rate @xmath43 for any user - class @xmath2 is an exogeneous input parameter ; * and the _ mobility model _ ( mm ) , consisting in the same markovian model but where , as expressed in section [ sec : fxpt ] , equ.([flow0])-([eq : fixedpoint_onecell ] ) , the arrival rate @xmath43 for any class @xmath2 is the sum of a given exogeneous arrival rate @xmath100 ( the fresh offered traffic ) and the handover arrival rate @xmath101 adjusted so as to balance the outgoing handover rate @xmath102 .",

    "also , as a check , note that simulation results perfectly match that of the markovian model in the case of exponential distributions .",
    "we envisage several distributions for @xmath103 so as to obtain a wide range of values for its variance ( with given mean ) . beside the exponential distribution",

    "note also the different stability regions : @xmath114 without mobility ( with a proportion of 50% static users ) and @xmath115 with mobility , as claimed in proposition [ stability ] .",
    "[ fig : imp_deb_mob50](b ) highlights a significant gain of mobile users throughput over that of static users .",
    "such throughput gains result from the opportunistic nature of mobile users who tend to leave the system when it is highly loaded . as indicated by fig .",
    "[ fig : imp_deb_mob50](c ) , the gains are obviously obtained at the expense of larger handover .",
    "we also considered different proportions of mobile users and different values of @xmath116 .",
    "qualitatively , the corresponding performance curves show a behavior quite similar to that of the above scenario . based on these observations",
    ", we will further pay no more attention to the sensitivity of performance indicators and always refer to the markovian setting with exponential distributions .",
    "we have further observed that the throughput gain of mobile over static users appears to be the greatest when the mobility rate is large ( say , more than twice the service rate for mobile users ) and when the proportion of mobile users is small ( say , 20% ) .",
    "we now validate our approach for reducing a homogeneous network of small cells to a single representative cell .",
    "handling now the mobility model , we stress the fact that the loads ( static , mobile or total ) as well as the proportion of traffic from each class all refer to the fresh offered traffic , that is , @xmath117                    we compare the outputs of simulation experiments on the homogeneous ring network represented in fig . [",
    "fig : ring_network ] to that of the corresponding single - cell mobility model .",
    "all four cells of the ring network are equivalent and have the same capacity and traffic parameters as in subsection [ sec / validation ] .",
    "all random variables are now supposed to be exponentially distributed , and we consider a series of three normalized mobility rates : @xmath116 equals 0.1 , 1 or 10 times the service capacity @xmath118 @xmath119 .",

    ", the four curves ( each corresponding to a given cell ) are plotted with the same color code ; note that they are almost indistinguishable from each other , except for the ratio @xmath111 .",
    "we first observe that the stability region is now characterized by @xmath120 .",
    "this can be easily understood since the considered queuing system is work - conserving , with mobile users re - entering the system until their transfer is completed .    * _ in the mobility model , condition _ * @xmath120 * _ ensures the existence of a fixed - point solution to equilibrium equation ( [ eq : fixedpoint_onecell ] ) , i.e. , @xmath121 . _ * [ conjectstab ]    note that , for simplicity , this condition will still be called a _ stability condition _ , as it translates the fact that the resource must have enough capacity to handle all offered traffic .",
    "although the proof of its sufficiency is open , its necessity is straighforward ; in fact , by conservation equations ( [ eq : conserv_law ] ) for classes @xmath50 and @xmath71 where @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 hence @xmath124 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : ann_deb_mob50](a)(b ) , we note that the throughput gains due to mobility increase , quite naturally , with the mobility rate .",
    "other complementary results with various proportions of mobile users confirmed that the mobile / static throughput gain is all the more important that the proportion of mobile users is weak .",
    "the latter simulation results are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : imp1_deb_mob50 ] to the markovian single - cell mobility model ( _ representative cell _ ) for the case when @xmath125 .",
    "we notice that the single - cell model provides slightly optimistic performance indicators : average throughputs greater and handover probability lower than those from simulation , particularly at high load . from plots obtained for other values of @xmath126",
    ", these discrepancies generally increase with the mobility rate , as expected .    in summary",
    ", the presented results provide a number of interesting features , such as the stability region , the good matching between model and simulation , the performance gain of mobile users versus static users , the high sensitivity of handover to various input parameters ( mobility rate , proportion of mobile users ) .",
    "the salient point , nevertheless , is the following : there is an inter - cell mobility gain created by the opportunistic displacement of mobile users within the network according to possible local load variations in individual cells .",
    "this throughput gain is perceived by both classes ( although at a lower level by static users ) and is predicted by simulation and by the markovian single - cell model as well .",
    "the qs approximation is compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : aps_deb_mob50 ] to the results of the markovian i m , with the same parameter setting as above but with normalized mobility rates of 0.2 , 1 and 5 .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation appears very good for all performance indicators .",
    "this has also been checked for other parameter settings , and particularly for other proportions of the mobile user class .",
    "when comparing the qs approximation to the markovian mm , however , we observed that the throughput of static users is somewhat lower in the approximation than in the exact model ( except when the impact of mobility is very weak , e.g. for a normalized mobility rate = 0.2 ) .",
    "we can give the following interpretation to this : in fact , when applying the first step of the qs approximation to the mm framework , the constant @xmath77 which solves equation ( [ eq : fixed_point ] ) can be explicitly written as @xmath127 ( after definitions @xmath128 , @xmath129 and the balance equation @xmath130 between handover arrival and departure rates ) . thus ,",
    "if computed from ( [ eq : gamma_qs ] ) after this first step , the static and mobile throughputs should be , as @xmath77 , independent of @xmath116 .",
    "this explains the poor behaviour observed above for the approximate model at this first step .",
    "the second step largely improves the accuracy , at least as regards the performance of mobile users , but the throughput of static users remains somewhat less precise and almost constant as can be seen for example in fig . [ fig : speed_mob_mob50 ] below .",
    "interpreting the previous results and figures helps us to assess the impact of the cell size . indeed , assuming a constant speed @xmath131 , the ( residual ) mean distance the mobile user travels in the cell",
    "is @xmath132 ; this mean distance typically equals the radius @xmath133 of a circular cell .",
    "thus for , e.g. , @xmath134 90 km / h , the values of @xmath116 considered above , namely @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( with @xmath118 @xmath119 ) respectively correspond to a radius of 10 m , 50 m and 250 m , typical of a femto , pico , and micro cell . as expected , users in femto cells experience the largest throughput since their mobility rate is the highest . as a counterpart ,",
    "the handover probability they generate is much higher than that in other types of cells .",
    "conversely , the values of the mobility rate @xmath116 may be interpreted in terms of various mobile speeds for a given cell size . specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig : speed_mob_mob50 ] shows the static and mobile users throughputs and the probability of handover in terms of speed @xmath131 for different values of the total offered load , 0.2 , 0.5 , and 0.8 , in the framework of the mm .",
    "the ( initial ) proportion of mobile users is still 50% and the cell radius is 50 m",
    "( a pico cell ) . in all plots ,",
    "the results are derived from the exact markovian model as well as from the qs approximation described above .",
    "as expected , all performance indicators are increasing functions of the speed .",
    "in particular , @xmath138 when @xmath139 , as predicted by ( [ eq : kpi_relation ] ) ; for @xmath140 , both static and mobile users throughputs equal @xmath141 , the common throughput achieved when all users are static .",
    "again , the qs approximation works nicely for predicting the performance of mobile users , although it is less accurate for the static user throughput .",
    "we investigated the impact of inter - cell mobility on user performance in the context of dense networks with small cells .",
    "our approach relies on two main ideas .",
    "first , we have reduced the evaluation of user performance in a homogeneous network to that of a single representative cell ( a generalization to a heterogeneous network has also been introduced ) .",
    "we have then developed simple analytical models that capture mobility through the distribution of the mobile users sojourn time in a cell .",
    "a simplifying approximate model has been derived in order to overcome scalability problems of the markovian model , or in view of possible extensions : based on a quasi - stationary assumption , this approximation takes into account the fundamentally distinct behaviors of static and mobile users .",
    "we can notably point out the following outcomes of our study : * ( i ) * as a step beyond available studies , we perform the computation of the handover probability , a key performance indicator which mitigates that of the user throughput ; * ( ii ) * our reduction approach to a single representative cell proves reasonable ; * ( iii ) * throughput performance is robust with respect to different distributions of the mobile users sojourn time and their flow volume . this insensitivity property justifies the use of markovian models ; * ( iv ) * the quasi - stationary approximation performs quite well in evaluating performance indicators in various parameter configurations ; * ( v ) * both classes of users are shown to benefit from a throughput gain induced by the opportunism of mobile users while they travel among cells .",
    "a follow - up to the present study can be envisaged by extending the analysis to cellular networks with spatially varying cell capacities , together with the generalization to heterogeneous cell networks",
