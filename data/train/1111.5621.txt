    "most of which exhibit such shallow transits that they require ultra - precise space - based photometry simply to detect the existence of their transits , gj1214b is unique . the diminutive 0.21 @xmath3  radius of its m dwarf stellar host means gj1214b exhibits a large 1.4% transit depth , and the system s proximity ( 13 pc ) means the star is bright enough in the near infrared ( @xmath4 ) that follow - up observations to study the planet s atmosphere are currently feasible . in this work",
    ", we exploit this observational advantage and present new measurements of the planet s atmosphere , which bear upon models for its interior composition and structure .    according to theoretical studies @xcite , gj1214b s 1.9",
    "g @xmath5 bulk density is high enough to require a larger ice or rock core fraction than the solar system ice giants but far too low to be explained with an entirely earth - like composition . @xcite",
    "have proposed three general scenarios consistent with gj1214b s large radius , where the planet could ( i ) have accreted and maintained a nebular h@xmath6/he envelope atop an ice and rock core , ( ii ) consist of a rocky planet with an h@xmath6-rich envelope that formed by recent outgassing , or ( iii ) contain a large fraction of water in its interior surrounded by a dense h@xmath6-depleted , h@xmath6o - rich atmosphere .",
    "detailed thermal evolution calculations by @xcite disfavor this last model on the basis that it would require unreasonably large bulk water - to - rock ratios , arguing for at least a partial h@xmath6/he  envelope , albeit one that might be heavily enriched in h@xmath6o  relative to the primordial nebula .    by measuring gj1214b s transmission spectrum , we can empirically constrain the mean molecular weight of the planet s atmosphere , thus distinguishing among these possibilities . when the planet passes in front of its host m dwarf , a small fraction of the star s light passes through the upper layers of the planet s atmosphere before reaching us ; the planet s transmission spectrum is then manifested in variations of the transit depth as a function of wavelength .",
    "the amplitude of the transit depth variations @xmath7 in the transmission spectrum scale as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is set by the opacities involved and can be 1 - 10 for strong absorption features , @xmath10 is the atmospheric scale height , @xmath11  is the planetary radius , and @xmath12  is the stellar radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "indeed , detailed radiative transfer simulations of gj1214b s atmosphere @xcite show that a solar composition , h@xmath6-dominated atmosphere ( @xmath14 ) would show depth variations of roughly @xmath15 between 0.6 and 10 , while the features in an h@xmath6o - dominated atmosphere ( @xmath16 ) would be an order of magnitude smaller . while the latter of these is likely too small to detect directly with current instruments ,",

    "spectroscopic observations by @xcite with the very large telescope found the transmission spectrum of gj1214b to be featureless between 0.78 - 1.0 , down to an amplitude that would rule out cloud - free h@xmath6-rich atmospheric models .",
    "broadband spizer space telescope photometric transit measurements at 3.6 and 4.5  by @xcite showed a flat spectrum consistent with @xcite , as did high - resolution spectroscopy with nirspec between 2.0 and 2.4  by @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the transit depth in @xmath17-band ( 2.2 ) was measured from cfht by @xcite to be 0.1% deeper than at other wavelengths , which would imply a h@xmath6-rich atmosphere , in apparent contradiction to the other studies .",
    "these seemingly incongruous observations could potentially be brought into agreement if gj1214b s atmosphere were h@xmath6-rich but significantly depleted in ch@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the molecular features that remain ( predominantly h@xmath6o ) would fit the cfht measurement , but be unseen by the nirspec and spitzer observations . explaining the flat vlt spectrum in this context",
    "would then require a broadband haze to smooth the spectrum at shorter wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",
    "new observations by @xcite covering 0.6 - 0.85  and 2.0 - 2.3  were again consistent with a flat spectrum , but they still could not directly speak to this possibility of a methane - depleted , h@xmath6-rich atmosphere with optically scattering hazes .    here , we present a new transmission spectrum of gj1214b spanning 1.1 to 1.7 , using the infrared slitless spectroscopy mode on the newly installed wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    due to the many possible configurations of transiting exomoons and the large gaps in our wfc3 light curve , our non - detection of moons does not by itself place strict limits on the presence of exo - moons around gj1214b .",
    "the average transmission spectrum of gj1214b from our three hst visits is shown in fig .  [",

    "this transmission spectrum is flat ; a simple weighted mean of the spectrum is a good fit , with @xmath130 for 23 degrees of freedom .",
    "we compare the wfc3 transmission spectrum to a suite of cloud - free theoretical atmosphere models for gj1214b .",
    "the models were calculated in @xcite , and we refer the reader to that paper for their details . to compare them to our transmission spectrum , we bin these high - resolution ( @xmath131 ) models to the effective wavelengths of the 5-pixel wfc3 spectroscopic channels ( @xmath132 ) by integrating over each bin . generally , to account for the possible suppression of transmission spectrum features caused by the overlap of shared planetary and stellar absorption lines , this binning should be weighted by the photons detected from the system at very high resolution , but this added complexity is not justified for our dataset .",
    "the normalization of the model spectra is uncertain ( i.e. the planet s true @xmath11 ) , so we allow a multiplicative factor in @xmath11/@xmath12  to be applied to each ( giving 24 - 1=23 degrees of freedom for all models ) .",
    "varying the bin size between 2 and 50 pixels wide does not significantly change any of the results we quote in this section .",
    "a solar composition atmosphere in thermochemical equilibrium is a terrible fit to the wfc3 spectrum ; it has a @xmath55=126.2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : transmissionspectrum ] ) and is formally ruled out at 8.2@xmath133 confidence . likewise , the same atmosphere but enhanced @xmath134 in elements heavier than helium , a qualitative approximation to the metal enhancement in the solar system ice giants ( enhanced @xmath135 in c / h ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is ruled out at @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "both models assume equilibrium molecular abundances and the absence of high - altitude clouds ; if gj1214b has an h@xmath6-rich atmosphere , at least one of these assumptions would have to be broken .",
    "suggesting , along these lines , that photochemistry might deplete gj1214b s atmosphere of methane , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have noted their observations to be consistent with a solar composition model in which ch@xmath18  has been artificially removed . with the wfc3 spectrum alone , we can rule out such an h@xmath6-rich , ch@xmath18-free atmosphere at 6.1@xmath133 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wfc3_models ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite s theoretical finding that such thorough methane depletion can not be achieved through photochemical processes , even when making extreme assumptions for the photoionizing uv flux from the star .",
    "previous spectroscopic measurements in the red optical @xcite could only be reconciled with a h@xmath6-rich atmosphere if such an atmosphere were to host a substantial cloud layer at an altitude above 200 mbar ( see * ? ? ?",
    "how far the flattening influence of such a cloud layer would extend beyond 1  to wfc3 wavelengths would depend on both the concentration and size distribution of the scattering particles .",
    "as such , we explore possible cloud scenarios consistent with the wfc3 spectrum in an _ ad hoc _ fashion , using a solar composition atmosphere and arbitrarily cutting off transmission below various pressures to emulate optically thick cloud decks at different altitudes in the atmosphere .",
    "[ fig : wfc3_clouds ] summarizes the results .",
    "a cloud deck at 100 mbar , which would be sufficient to flatten the red optical spectrum , is ruled out at @xmath138 ( @xmath139 . due to higher opacities between 1.1 and 1.7 ,",
    "wfc3 probes higher altitudes in the atmosphere than the red optical , requiring clouds closer to 10 mbar to match the data ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "note , with the term `` clouds '' we refer to all types of particles that cause broad - band extinction , whether they scatter or absorb , and whether they were formed through near - equilibrium condensation ( such as earth s water clouds ) or through upper atmosphere photochemistry ( such as titan s haze ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite identified kcl and zns as condensates that would be likely to form in gj1214b s atmosphere , but found they would condense deeper in the atmosphere ( 200 - 500 mbar ) than required by the wfc3 spectrum and would probably not be optically thick . while winds may be able to loft such clouds to higher altitudes ,",
    "it is not clear that the abundance of these species alone would be sufficient to blanket the entire limb of the planet with optically thick clouds .",
    "the condensation and complicated evolution of clouds has been studied within the context of cool stars and hot jupiters ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but further study into the theoretical landscape for equilibrium clouds on planets in gj1214b s gravity and temperature regime is certainly warranted .",
    "the scattering may also be due to a high altitude haze formed as by - products of high - altitude photochemistry ; @xcite found the conditions on gj1214b to allow for the formation of complex hydrocarbon clouds through methane photolysis .",
    "however such clouds might form , they would either need to be optically thick up to a well - defined altitude or consist of a substantial distribution of particles acting in the mie regime , i.e. with sizes approaching 1 .",
    "neither the vlt spectra nor our observations give any definitive indications of the smooth falloff in transit depth toward longer wavelengths that would be expected from rayleigh scattering by molecules or small particles .",
    "this is unlike the case of the hot jupiter hd189733b , where the uniform decrease in transit depth from 0.3 to 1  @xcite and perhaps to as far as 3.6  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been convincingly attributed to a small particle haze .    as an alternative",
    ", the transmission spectrum of gj1214b could be flat simply because the atmosphere has a large mean molecular weight .",
    "we test this possibility with h@xmath6  atmospheres that contain increasing fractions of h@xmath6o .",
    "this is a toy model , but including molecules other than h@xmath6  or h@xmath6o  in the atmosphere would serve principally to increase @xmath13 without substantially altering the opacity between 1.1 and 1.7 , so the limits we place on @xmath13 are robust .",
    "we find that an atmosphere with a 10% water by number ( 50% by mass ) is disfavored by the wfc3 spectrum at @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmissionspectrum ] .",
    "all fractions of water above 20% ( 70% by mass ) are good fits to the data ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the @xmath144 water atmosphere would have a minimum mean molecular weight of @xmath145 , which we take as a lower limit on the atmosphere s mean molecular weight .",
    "for the sake of placing the wfc3 transmission spectrum in the context of other observations of gj1214b , we also display it alongside the published transmission spectra from the vlt @xcite , cfht @xcite , magellan @xcite , and spitzer @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : combinedtransmissionspectrum ] . stellar variability could cause individual sets of observations to move up and down on this plot by as much as @xmath125 for measurements in the near - ir @xcite ; we indicate this range of potential offsets by an arrow at the right of the plot .",
    "we display the measurements in fig .",
    "[ fig : combinedtransmissionspectrum ] with no relative offsets applied and note that their general agreement is consistent with the predicted small influence of stellar variability .",
    "depending on the temperature contrast of the spots , however , the variability could be larger by a factor of @xmath146 in the optical , and we caution the reader to consider this systematic uncertainty when comparing depths between individual studies",
    ". for instance , the slight apparent rise in @xmath11/@xmath12  toward 0.6 , that would potentially be consistent with rayleigh scattering in a low-@xmath13 atmosphere , could also be easily explained through the poorly constrained behavior of the star in the optical .",
    "indeed , @xcite found a significant offset between datasets that overlap in wavelength ( near 0.8 ) but were taken in different years , suggesting variability plays a non - negligible role at these wavelengths .",
    "finally , we note that any model with @xmath147 , such as one with a @xmath148 mass fraction of water , would be consistent with the measurements from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and wfc3 . the only observation it could not explain would be the deep @xmath149-measurement from @xcite . of the theoretical models we tested",
    ", we could find none that matched all the available measurements .",
    "we are uncertain of how to interpret this apparent incompatibility but hopeful that future observational and theoretical studies of the gj1214b system may clarify the issue . in the meantime",
    ", we adopt an atmosphere with at least 50% water by mass as the most plausible model to explain the wfc3 observations .      if gj1214b is not shrouded in achromatically optically thick high - altitude clouds , the wfc3 transmission spectrum disfavors any proposed bulk composition for the planet that relies on a substantial , unenriched , hydrogen envelope to explain the planet s large radius .",
    "both the ice - rock core with nebular h / he envelope and pure rock core with outgassed h@xmath6  envelope scenarios explored by @xcite would fall into this category , requiring additional ingredients to match the observations .",
    "in contrast , their model that achieves gj1214b s large radius mostly from a large water - rich core , would agree with our observations .",
    "perhaps most compellingly , a high @xmath13 scenario would be consistent with composition proposed by @xcite , who found that gj1214b s radius could be explained by a bulk composition consisting of an ice - rock core surrounded by a h / he / h@xmath6o  envelope that has a water mass fraction of 50 - 85%",
    ". such a composition would be intermediate between the h / he- and h@xmath6o - envelope limiting cases proposed by @xcite .",
    "the h / he / h@xmath6o  envelope might arise if gj1214b had originally accreted a substantial mass of hydrogen and helium from the primordial nebula but then was depleted of its lightest molecules through atmospheric escape .",
    "future observations with the james webb space telescope @xcite , one of the immense next generation ground - based telescopes ( gmt , tmt , elt ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or possibly even a dedicated campaign with current facilities , could detect the 0.01% transmission spectrum features of a 100% water atmosphere on gj1214b , and potentially distinguish between clear h@xmath6-poor and cloudy h@xmath6-rich atmospheres .",
    "along another front , simulations by @xcite show that observations of gj1214b s thermal phase curve , such as those for hd189733b by @xcite , would probe the ratio of radiative to advective timescales in gj1214b s outer envelope and provide an independent constraint on the atmospheric composition . detecting",
    "the thermal emission from this 500k exoplanet is currently very difficult , and will likely have to wait until the launch of jwst .    in the meantime",
    ", we advocate further study of the gj1214 system in general . confirming and refining the parallax for the system @xcite will improve our knowledge of the stellar mass , and in turn , the planet s mass and radius .",
    "likewise , further radial velocity observations will empirically constrain the hypothesis by @xcite that a significantly non - zero orbital eccentricity could be biasing gj1214b s inferred density .",
    "in this work , we made new measurements of the gj1214b s transmission spectrum using hst / wfc3 . reaching a precision of @xmath150 in 24 simultaneously measured wavelength bins",
    ", we found the transmission spectrum to be completely flat between 1.1 and 1.7 .",
    "we saw no evidence for the strong h@xmath6o  absorption features expected from a range of h@xmath6-rich model atmospheres .",
    "given the lack of a known source for clouds or hazes that could create a truly achromatic transit depth across all wavelengths , we interpret this flat wfc3 transmission spectrum to be best explained by an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight .",
    "based on our observations , this atmosphere would likely consist of more than 50% water by mass or a mean molecular weight of @xmath147 . such an atmosphere would be consistent with observations of gj1214b s transmission spectrum by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite although it would be difficult to reconcile with those by @xcite .",
    "such a constraint on gj1214b s upper atmosphere serves as a boundary condition for models of bulk composition and structure of the rest of the planet .",
    "it suggests gj1214b contains a substantial fraction of water throughout the interior of the planet in order to obviate the need for a completely h / he- or h@xmath6-dominated envelope to explain the planet s large radius .",
    "a high bulk volatile content would point to gj1214b forming beyond the snow line and migrating inward , although any such statements about gj1214b s past are subject to large uncertainties in the atmospheric mass loss history ( see * ? ? ?",
    "finally , this paper is the first published study using wfc3 for observing a transiting exoplanet . aside from several instrumental systematics that were straightforward to correct and did not require a detailed instrumental model , the camera delivered nearly photon - limited performance both in individual spectrophotometric light curves and in summed white light curves .",
