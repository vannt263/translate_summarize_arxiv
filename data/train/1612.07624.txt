    "<S> 5b , d , and e ) that are beyond the scope of the present study , good agreement between our transport simulation and experiment showing the oscillation period well fulfilling eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cond ] ) can be seen .        </S>",
    "<S> other works @xcite report on the formation of so called snake states along _ p_-_n _ interfaces in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> snake states result in a minimum in the conductance whenever the sample width @xmath41 and the cyclotron radius @xmath42 satisfy @xmath43 with @xmath44 a positive integer . in the density range of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mapping]b , e this would lead to two resonances at most ( indicated by green dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mapping]b , e ) , which is far less than the observed number of resonances . on top of that , snake states are inconsistent with the observed absence of a dependence on sample width . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the tight - binding simulation also confirms that the observed effect is independent of the sample width and can not be suppressed by introducing strong lattice defects in the vicinity of the _ p_-_n _ junction ( see supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore rule out snaking trajectories as a possible cause of the observed oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> another process which could give rise to oscillations in a graphene _ p_-_n _ junction in a magnetic field is the interference of charge carriers which are partly reflected and partly transmitted at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> when the charge carrier densities are equal on both sides of the interface , electrons and holes will have equal cyclotron radii and therefore the paths of transmitted and reflected charge carriers will form closed loops . for the case of equal density </S>",
    "<S> , this model predicts the right periodicity of the oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite experimentally , however , the measured oscillations are still visible when the densities on both sides of the _ p_-_n _ interface are quite different : at the point ( @xmath9,@xmath8 ) = ( 12,-6 )  v for example ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : mapping]b ) , the cyclotron radii on the _ p _ and _ n _ side are respectively 0.36  @xmath3 m and 0.16  @xmath3 m . </S>",
    "<S> the path lengths hence differ by @xmath45 m , which is more than seven times the fermi wavelength ( 0.02  @xmath3 m and 0.05  @xmath3 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> it seems unlikely that interference between charge carriers on skipping orbits can still occur in this density regime . on top of that , </S>",
    "<S> the tight - binding simulations show that the oscillatory pattern is still present when introducing large - area lattice defects in the vicinity of the _ </S>",
    "<S> p_-_n _ junction , which destroy the skipping trajectories ( see supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the observed oscillations can not be ascribed to interference of charge carriers on cyclotron orbits at the _ p_-_n _ interface .    </S>",
    "<S> since the oscillations occur in both single - layer and bilayer graphene , we exclude an explanation that relies on specific details of the dispersion relation . in the magnetic field range where the oscillations are observed </S>",
    "<S> , the sample width is comparable to the classical cyclotron diameter . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes explanations based on classical electron flow following skipping orbit - like motion along edges .    </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism which may cause the oscillations involves the alignment of the density of states ( dos ) around the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> diagrams of the dos in the single- and dual - gated regions are sketched in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]a - c . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:4]d shows a zoom in the map of the oscillatory transconductance of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : mapping]c . at point </S>",
    "<S> in this zoom the filling factor in the dual - gated regime is @xmath46  180 and @xmath47  -92 in the single - gated region . because of the fourfold degeneracy of the landau levels , landau level numbers are @xmath48  45 and @xmath48  -23 respectively , as shown in the dos diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]a . </S>",
    "<S> when following the oscillatory pattern from point to point , the two combs of dos remain aligned with one another and only the fermi level changes . </S>",
    "<S> this in contrast to what happens when moving from point to point : the doss shift with respect to one another and the transconductance oscillates </S>",
    "<S> . it could therefore be the case that the alignment of the dos affects the conductance of the _ p_-_n _ interface in a way similar to the magneto - intersubband oscillations ( miso ) of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg):@xcite the occupation of two energy subbands of a 2deg can lead to enhanced scattering between the subbands when the doss of the subbands are aligned . </S>",
    "<S> a similar enhancement of the coupling could occur in a graphene _ p_-_n _ junction . </S>",
    "<S> just as for the oscillations we report on , miso persist up to relatively high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the spacing predicted by this model lacks a factor of two compared to the experiment however : it would predict the argument of the cosine of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cond ] ) to be @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation of the data requires the invocation of an even - odd asymmetry between the landau levels to describe the measured periodicity : a coupling between landau levels leading to higher / lower conductance when landau levels of same / opposite parities are aligned , could account for the missing factor of two .    c. the alignment of the densities of states can lead to an oscillatory pattern with the right slope : along the line from point a to point b the two combs of densities of states stay aligned , whereas the combs shift with respect to one another when moving from point a to point c.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in conclusion , we have observed oscillations in the conductance of six graphene _ </S>",
    "<S> p_-_n _ junctions in the magnetic field range of @xmath50  t. the oscillations are independent of sample width and can be described by the filling factor difference between the single- and dual - gated region . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations are quite robust against temperature changes : they fade out only in the range of @xmath51  k , whereas shubnikov - de haas oscillations decay below @xmath27  k. the oscillations can be well reproduced by tight - binding transport calculations considering an ideal p - n junction at a constant magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> up to a factor of two , the oscillatory pattern can be explained by considering the density of states alignment of the single- and dual - gated regions . </S>"
