    "the minimal surfaces are a topic of great interest in many areas as mathematics , computer science , physics , medicine , architecture .",
    "the reason is that in small areas they have a minimizing property .    for the applications of minimal surfaces , in particular in computer graphic research , it is important to use minimal surfaces in polynomial form and hence to know all such surfaces in small degrees . in this direction cosn and monterde",
    "@xcite proved that up to position in space and homothety the only polynomial minimal surface of degree three in isothermal parameters is the classical enneper surface .",
    "the case of degree four is considered in @xcite .",
    "polynomial minimal surfaces of degrees five and six are studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "theorems about their coefficients - vectors are found and some examples are considered .",
    "unfortunately the systems for the coefficients are very complicated and the general solution is difficult to be found . in @xcite ,",
    "polynomial minimal surfaces of arbitrary degree constructed on some special functions are studied , and thus some special surfaces are proposed .",
    "it is remarked that in degrees 3 and 5 these surfaces coincide with the enneper surface and some of the surfaces from @xcite , respectively .    in the present paper",
    "we first show that a polynomial minimal surface in isothermal parameters must be generated via the weierstrass formula with a polynomial and a rational function ( section 3 ) .",
    "then in section 4 we determine all polynomial minimal surfaces of degree five but we do not try to solve the system for the coefficients .",
    "instead we use the result from section 3 and we obtain a list of functions that generate via the weierstrass formula all such surfaces .",
    "the surfaces introduced in @xcite belong to one of the obtained families , but these families contain many other surfaces as well .",
    "it is natural to ask whether these families contain different surfaces . in general the problem of comparing surfaces given in different parametric form",
    "is very complicated . for minimal surfaces",
    "such a method is proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the canonical parameters introduced in @xcite and then solving an ordinary differential equation for finding these parameters .    when trying to investigate the relation between the families obtained in section 4 we can not use directly the method from @xcite , because we can not find a simple form of the surfaces in canonical parameters .",
    "so we change a little the approach and we escape solving the differential equation for the transition to canonical parameters . as a result",
    "we find that the obtained three families contain different minimal surfaces except in a special case .",
    "let @xmath0 be a regular surface in the euclidean space defined by the parametric equation @xmath1 the derivatives of the vector function @xmath2 are usualy denoted by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , etc .",
    "then the coefficients of the first fundamental form are equal to the scalar products @xmath6    the unit normal to the surface is the vector field @xmath7    in particular , if @xmath8 , @xmath9 , then the parameters @xmath10 of the surface are called _",
    "isothermal_.    the coefficients of the second fundamental form of @xmath0 are given by @xmath11    the gauss curvature @xmath12 and the mean curvature @xmath13 of @xmath0 are defined respectively by @xmath14 recall that the surface @xmath0 is called _ minimal _ if its mean curvature vanishes identically . in this case",
    "it follows easily that the gauss curvature is nonpositive .",
    "the study of minimal surfaces is closely related with some complex curves  those with isotropic tangent vectors .",
    "they are called _",
    "minimal curves_. indeed we have the following construction .",
    "let @xmath0 be a minimal surface defined in isothermal parameters .",
    "then it can be considered as the real part of a minimal curve .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be two holomorphic functions .",
    "define the weierstrass complex curve @xmath17 by @xmath18 then @xmath19 is a minimal curve and its real and imaginary parts @xmath20 and @xmath21 are harmonic functions that define two minimal surfaces in isothermal parametrizations .",
    "we say that these two minimal surfaces are _",
    "conjugate_. moreover , every minimal surface can be obtained at least locally as the real ( as well as the imaginary ) part of a weierstrass minimal curve .",
    "for any two conjugate minimal surfaces @xmath20 and @xmath21 it is defined the _ associated family _",
    "@xmath22 , where @xmath23 then for any real number @xmath24 the surface @xmath25 is also minimal and has the same first fundamental form as @xmath26 .",
    "taking @xmath27 , @xmath28 , we obtain a weierstrass minimal curve whose real part is the classical enneper surface @xmath29 it is well known that the enneper surface coincide ( up to position in space ) with any surface in its associated family , see e.g. @xcite",
    ".    in @xcite ganchev introduces _ the canonical principal parameters_. if a surface is parametrized with them , the coefficients of its fundamental forms are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the _ normal curvature _ of the surface . actually a surface in canonical principal parametrization",
    "is the real part of a weierstrass minimal curve generated by some functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath32 , i.e. it is the real part of the special weierstrass curve @xmath33    the canonical principal parameters and the normal curvature play a role similar to that of the natural parameters and the curvature and torsion of a space curve . namely the following theorem holds :    [ t:2.1 ] @xcite if a surface is parametrized with canonical principal parameters , then its normal curvature @xmath34 satisfies the differential equation @xmath35 conversely , for any solution @xmath36 of this equation ( with @xmath37 ) , there exists an * unique * ( up to position in space ) minimal surface with normal curvature @xmath36 , @xmath10 being canonical principal parameters .",
    "moreover , the canonical principal parameters @xmath10 are determined uniquely up to the following transformations @xmath38    we will also use the following results :    [ t:2.2 ] @xcite let the minimal surface @xmath0 be defined by the real part of the weierstrass minimal curve ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) . any solution of the differential equation @xmath39 defines a transformation of the isothermal parameters of @xmath0 to canonical principal parameters . moreover the function @xmath40 that defines @xmath0 via the ganchev formula is given by @xmath41 .",
    "[ t:2.3 ] @xcite let the holomorphic function @xmath42 generate a minimal surface in canonical principal parameters , i.e. via the ganchev formula .",
    "then , for an arbitrary complex number @xmath43 , and for an arbitrary real number @xmath44 , any of the functions @xmath45 generates the same surface in canonical principal parameters ( up to position in space ) .",
    "conversely , any function that generates this surface ( up to position in space ) in canonical principal parameters has one of the above forms .    in sections 4 and 5",
    "we shall consider minimal polynomial surfaces of degree five .",
    "an interesting study of such surfaces is presented in @xcite .",
    "first of all it is proved that the harmonic condition implies that such a surface must have the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 are coefficient vectors . for these coefficients",
    "the following holds , see @xcite :    [ t:2.4 . ] the harmonic polynomial surface ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) is minimal if and only if its coefficient vectors satisfy the following system of equations @xmath48    is seems impossible to find the general solution of the system ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) .",
    "so in @xcite some special solutions are considered and several interesting properties are proved for the obtained surfaces . using a different approach we shall find all polynomial minimal surfaces of degree five .",
    "as is said in introduction , polynomial minimal surfaces of arbitrary degree are studied in @xcite .",
    "the following construction is proposed .",
    "consider the functions @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the smallest integer not less than @xmath51 and @xmath52 denotes the largest integer not greater than @xmath51 .",
    "then it is proved that for any real number @xmath53 the polynomial surface of degree @xmath54 defined by @xmath55 is minimal .",
    "of course this large family is very interesting .",
    "but it is important also to know are these all the possible polynomial minimal surfaces and if not to find other families . to resolve the last problem we propose the following approach .",
    "let @xmath56 be a polynomial minimal surface of degree @xmath54 in isothermal parameters .",
    "then @xmath57 are polynomials of degree @xmath58 , and at least for one @xmath59 there is an equality .",
    "suppose that the parametrization is isothermal and @xmath0 is defined in an open subset of @xmath60 , containing @xmath61 .",
    "from lemma 22.25 in @xcite it follows that ( up to translation ) @xmath20 is the real part of the minimal curve @xmath62 so this minimal curve is also polynomial of degree @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath63 for some functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the coordinate functions @xmath64 are polynomials of degree at least @xmath65 so that at least for one @xmath66 the degree of @xmath64 is exactly @xmath67 .",
    "hence every one of the functions @xmath68 is a polynomial and so @xmath69 are polynomials of degree @xmath65 and at least for one @xmath66 the degree in ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) is exactly @xmath67 .",
    "so @xmath15 is a polynomial of degree @xmath65 .",
    "now @xmath70 implies that @xmath16 is a rational function of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are polynomials ( of degrees @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively ) with no common zeros .",
    "according to @xmath76 the function @xmath77 is also a polynomial , so @xmath78 with a polynomial @xmath79 ( of degree @xmath80 ) .",
    "moreover since the polynomials @xmath81 are of degree @xmath65 , then  @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84  and at least once there is an equality .",
    "conversely it is easy to see that for arbitrary polynomials @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath79 with the above restrictions on @xmath85 , the functions ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) , ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) generate a minimal polynomial surface of degree @xmath54 via the weierstrass formula .",
    "so we have    [ t:3.1 ] any polynomial minimal surface of degree @xmath54 in isothermal parameters is generated via the weierstrass formula by two functions of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 are polynomials of degree @xmath85 , respectively and  @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84  with at least one equality .",
    "conversely any two functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 with the above form generate a minimal polynomial surface of degree @xmath54 via the weierstrass formula .",
    "with the notations of the previous section we assume @xmath88",
    ". then @xmath89 with at least one equality . according to the first two equations in theorem [ t:2.4 . ]",
    "we may assume that ( up to a change of the coordinate system ) @xmath90 , @xmath91 and hence @xmath92    then @xmath93 and @xmath94 imply  @xmath95 , @xmath96 , so the following cases can appear :    \\1 . @xmath97",
    ". then @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 . to obtain another functions defining the surface we can use a consequence of the following assertion :    [ t:4.1 ] @xcite suppose the pairs @xmath103 and @xmath104 generate two minimal surfaces via the weierstrass formula",
    ". then these surfaces coincide ( up to translation ) iff there exists a function @xmath105 , such that @xmath106    [ t:4.2 ] suppose the pair @xmath107 generates a minimal surface via the weierstrass formula .",
    "then for arbitrary numbers @xmath43 @xmath108 , @xmath109 the pair @xmath110 generates the same minimal surface ( up to translation ) .",
    "using corollary [ t:4.2 ] with  @xmath111   we can say that the surface is generated by two functions of the form    1.1 .",
    "@xmath100 , @xmath112 , with @xmath113 .",
    "analogously we obtain the cases :    1.2 .",
    "@xmath97 , @xmath114 , @xmath98 and   @xmath115 , @xmath116 , with @xmath117 .    2.1 .",
    "@xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and   @xmath121 , @xmath122 , with @xmath123 ;    2.2 .",
    "@xmath124 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and   @xmath125 , @xmath126 , with @xmath127 ;    \\3 .",

    "@xmath118 , @xmath114 , @xmath128 and   @xmath131 , @xmath132 , with @xmath123 .",
    "we will denote the corresponding surfaces @xmath133(u , v)$ ] , @xmath134(u , v)$ ]  etc .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the case @xmath135 is not interesting , because in this case the surface is not of degree 5 .",
    "now we note that the following can be easily proved :    [ t:4.3 ] consider the surfaces @xmath136 @xmath137 denote by @xmath138 the surface , symmetric of @xmath139 about the plane @xmath140 .",
    "then @xmath141 and @xmath142 coincide if and only if @xmath143 for some function @xmath144 .    using this proposition",
    "we see that the surfaces from cases 2.1 , 2.2 and 4 can be viewed as symmetric to those in cases 1.1 , 1.2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "consequently we have    [ t:4.4 ] any polynomial minimal surface of degree 5 in isothermal parameters coincides up to position in space and symmetry with a surface generated via the weierstrass formula with the pair of functions    1.1 .",
    "@xmath100 , @xmath112 , with @xmath113 .    1.2 .",
    "@xmath115 , @xmath116 , with @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath129 , @xmath130 , with @xmath123 ,    where @xmath145 are complex numbers .",
    "the family of surfaces introduced in @xcite belongs to the case 1.2 .",
    "more precisely the family from @xcite is defined by @xmath146 with @xmath147 where @xmath148 are real parameters .",
    "for @xmath149 the surfaces are minimal .",
    "such a surface is generated by the weierstrass formula with @xmath150 so it belongs to the case 1.2 with @xmath151 .",
    "for some special values of the parameters the surfaces from theorem [ t:4.4 ] obviously coincide .",
    "namely if @xmath152 in @xmath134(u , v)$ ] , the surface is of type 3 . on the other hand",
    "even when this equality is not satisfied , the corresponding surfaces may look very similar , as fig .",
    "5.1 and fig .",
    "5.2 show .",
    "we use a similar idea to investigate a possible coincidence of surfaces from cases 1.1 and 1.2 .",
    "let the surface @xmath153(u , v)$ ] be generated via the weierstrass formula by @xmath154 and suppose that it coincides with @xmath155(u , v)$ ]",
    ". then some functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 that generate them in canonical parameters are related by @xmath158 as before , we consider only the first possibility .",
    "denote @xmath159 , @xmath160 respective solutions of the equation ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) .",
    "then @xmath161 and hence @xmath162 on the other hand analogously to ( [ eq:5.5 ] ) @xmath163 holds . applying ( [ eq:5.6])([eq:5.9 ] )",
    "we can find the left hand side of the above equality as a function of @xmath160 . then looking at the coefficients of @xmath160",
    "we conclude that this equality implies a contradiction .",
    "so a surface @xmath164 can not coincide with a surface @xmath165 .",
    "the surfaces generated via the weierstrass formula by the pairs of functions @xmath168 are homothetic for any positive real number @xmath169 . on the other hand , if @xmath170 is not real , these surfaces are different in general .",
    "more precisely let @xmath171 for a real number @xmath44 .",
    "the pairs @xmath172 and @xmath173 generate two homothetic surfaces , but the surface generated by @xmath174 belongs to the associated family of the surface generated by @xmath173 .",
