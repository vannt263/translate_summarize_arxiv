    "superstring theory provides a comprehensive way to unify a model of particle physics and gravitational theory in a quantum theory .",
    "three gauge interactions of the standard model of particle physics and the graviton , which arises from quantization of gravity , are realized as massless string excitation modes .",
    "the six - dimensional extra dimensions which are predicted by superstring theory are compactified into some manifold , and strings on the manifold provide geometrical interpretations of fundamental particles  quarks and leptons .    in order to make string - derived models phenomenologically realistic ,",
    "moduli stabilization and supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking in the low energy effective theory should be addressed .",
    "these issues have been studied extensively in d - brane string models ( see for a review @xcite ) . for example , in the kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi scenario of type iib orientifolds @xcite , complex structure moduli fields as well as the dilaton field are stabilized by inclusions of 3-form fluxes among compactified internal spaces , and khler moduli fields can be stabilized by non - perturbative effects caused by hidden sector dynamics . at that stage",
    ", there is a supersymmetric anti de sitter vacuum .",
    "then , susy is explicitly broken by inclusion of anti - d - branes , and such susy breaking uplifts the vacuum to lead to very small but positive vacuum energy .",
    "spontaneous susy breaking can also uplift the vacuum , e.g. in the f - term uplifting scenario @xcite .",
    "however , in heterotic string models , these issues are not solved easily though several attempts for moduli stabilization and susy breaking in heterotic string models have been made ( see for a review @xcite ) .    in heterotic string models , in order to address these issues , non - perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "moduli fields can be stabilized by a potential which is made by multiple gaugino condensations  this is called the racetrack mechanism @xcite .",
    "one of the possibilities to break susy is dynamical susy breaking . in @xcite , it is argued that , in @xmath6 sqcd with a suitable number of light flavors , susy is broken dynamically at a non - supersymmetric and long - lived metastable vacuum .",
    "moreover , heterotic string theory in generic compactification includes many moduli fields such as the dilaton , khler moduli and complex structure moduli fields .",
    "we need several dynamics to stabilize all of them .",
    "however , realization of suitable hidden gauge sectors which cause gaugino condensations is strongly restricted in heterotic string models since the rank of gauge symmetry is typically 16 .",
    "our standard model gauge group @xmath7 has rank 4 , and heterotic string models have multiple additional @xmath8s ( commonly around ten , though this number is model dependent of course ) .",
    "thus there is a little room for multiple hidden gauge sectors .",
    "our strategy to attack this problem is to start with a string model at a symmetry enhancement point in moduli space in order to enlarge a rank of hidden gauge groups . in this paper",
    ", we consider moduli stabilization in heterotic string models from the asymmetric orbifold construction @xcite . in this formalism , the rank of gauge symmetry is enhanced : it attains the maximum allowed value of 22 , since we make models from a narain lattice that corresponds to a symmetry enhancement point in moduli space .",
    "thus we expect that there are several hidden gauge sectors which are suitable for moduli stabilization and susy breaking . furthermore , by the asymmetric orbifold action , geometric moduli fields except the dilaton field are frozen @xcite",
    ". then the number of moduli fields is very small , and we can concentrate on dilaton stabilization only . in this paper ,",
    "dilaton stabilization and susy breaking by the enlarged hidden gauge sectors will be discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we construct a three - generation model from a heterotic asymmetric orbifold . in section 3 , we analyze dilaton stabilization in the obtained three - generation model .",
    "we also comment on a possible susy breaking scenario .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we construct a four - dimensional susy standard model with three generations in the framework of the heterotic asymmetric orbifold construction @xcite . in @xcite , the model building procedure and",
    "some three - generation models are shown .",
    "we consider a @xmath9 asymmetric orbifold action , which is the simplest choice for four - dimensional @xmath6 susy .",
    "our starting point is a four - dimensional heterotic string theory compactified on a narain lattice @xcite .",
    "narain lattices can be described by a metric , b - fields and wilson lines along the internal six - dimensional spaces , which are suitably chosen to be on an enhancement point in the moduli space @xcite .",
    "thus the rank of the gauge symmetry is the maximum allowed value of 22 , which originates from 22-dimensional compactified directions in the left mover . at the gauge enhancement point",
    "we can realize a relatively rich source of multiple hidden sectors .    here",
    "we build a string model from the @xmath10 lattice , which is described by the following conjugacy class generators @xmath11 of @xmath10 model building are classified . in @xcite , by using the same lattice , a three - generation model was constructed . in this paper , we choose different choice of @xmath9 shift action . ] . here , the normalization for the @xmath8 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "to reduce susy from @xmath13 to @xmath6 , we choose the following @xmath9 twist vector @xmath14 for the right mover @xmath15 we do not consider any twist action for the left mover .",
    "we choose a shift vector @xmath16 for the left mover as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes simple roots of the @xmath19 group .",
    "this shift vector satisfies the modular invariance condition for @xmath9 orbifold models , @xmath20 hence , this model is a consistent model .    following the model building procedure in @xcite , we can read off the massless spectrum of the four - dimensional model as given in table [ tab : spectrum ] . by the @xmath9 shift action , the original gauge symmetry @xmath21 associated with the starting @xmath10 narain lattice reduces to @xmath22 this model contains @xmath23 multiplets in the untwisted sector and @xmath24 multiplets in the @xmath9 twisted sector . the factor",
    "@xmath25 in the twisted sector comes from the degeneracy factor @xmath26 . in table 1",
    ", we label all fields as @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath8 normalizations for @xmath29 are taken to be @xmath30 among the ten @xmath8s , we find suitable hyper @xmath31 and anomalous @xmath32 symmetries by taking the following linear combinations @xmath33 by this choice of the hyper charge , it turns out that this model contains suitable three - generation standard model particles .",
    "additional particles are vectorlike fields with respect to the standard model group @xmath7 which , at low energy scale , are expected to have effective masses , as well as singlets including candidates of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "note that we do not have any fields which are uncharged under the anomalous @xmath34 symmetry in the untwisted sector .",
    "thus , this model does not contain any untwisted geometric moduli fields except the dilaton field .",
    "the anomaly caused by the anomalous @xmath34 symmetry can be canceled by the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "mixed anomalies associated with abelian or non - abelian groups satisfy the green - schwarz universality condition , @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to a non - abelian group and its kac - moody level . in our case ,",
    "@xmath38 for all non - abelian groups in this model .",
    "@xmath39 represents the dynkin index of the representation @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 mean charges of the abelian groups which are orthogonal to the anomalous @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "let us proceed to an effective theory analysis to see the structure of the hidden sector .",
    "the d - term of the anomalous @xmath34 includes the dilaton - dominant fi - term , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the derivative of the khler potential by the dilaton @xmath44 .",
    "we can check that the d - flatness conditions for ten @xmath8s including anomalous @xmath34 with the fi term , @xmath45 can be satisfied if the following fields get non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) as @xmath46 note that we omitted the degeneracy factor @xmath26 in the expression , however , their contributions are correctly taken into account .",
    "non - abelian d - flatness conditions are also satisfied . by the vevs ,",
    "@xmath47 symmetry including the anomalous @xmath34 symmetry in the original gauge symmetry breaks down , so the unbroken gauge symmetry reads @xmath48 the tree level superpotential is given by @xmath49 here , the degeneracy factor should be taken into account as follows : a three point coupling exists only if all components are different .",
    "for instance , for the first term , @xmath50 is allowed only if @xmath51 .",
    "the coefficients for the three point couplings are of @xmath52 and they were omitted .",
    "this is because the first three terms are untwisted uuu couplings , and the other terms are twisted ttt coupling without world - sheet instanton effect since we make a model at a symmetry enhancement point .",
    "below the string scale , several vectorlike particles become supermassive by the vevs and decouple .",
    "now we summarize resulting field contents in table [ tab : mattercontents ] . in the visible sector , we have three - generation quarks and leptons of susy standard model .",
    "additional fields are vectorlike fields which include up - type and down - type higgs pair , and singlets . we find that we have three hidden sector gauge groups , @xmath53 , with vectorlike flavor numbers @xmath54 at the tree level superpotential .",
    "in this section , we analyze the hidden sector of the effective theory of our model .",
    "we analyze the @xmath55 hidden sector to stabilize the dilaton field , and regard the @xmath56 hidden sector as susy breaking sector .      when the anomalous @xmath34 symmetry breaks down , certain fields develop vevs and make the anomalous @xmath32 vector multiplet @xmath57 massive .",
    "thus , we use the unitary gauge , i.e. , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the chiral field direction eaten by @xmath57 and @xmath60 is its ( effective ) charge .",
    "the dilaton @xmath44 is also non - linearly transformed under @xmath32 .",
    "hence , we use the modified dilaton basis , @xmath61 for simplicity , hereafter we denote @xmath62 as @xmath44 .",
    "we concentrate on the hidden gauge sectors , @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath63 hidden sector has six flavors , @xmath64 . also , the @xmath65 sector has six flavors , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . at the level of the superpotential term ,",
    "these six flavors are massless .",
    "however , the vevs ( [ vev ] ) as well as other singlets generate their masses through higher dimensional operators , @xmath68 here the effective mass matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 depend on vevs of some scalar fields @xmath71 which are not charged under the unbroken group .",
    "we assume that all flavors become massive and eigenvalues of the mass matrices are positive , however , their mass scales highly depend on the detail of the model . hence , we introduce the parameters , @xmath72 if these mass scales are sufficiently high , all the flavors decouple and the hidden sectors become pure supersymmetric yang - mills theories below such scales",
    ". then , their gauginos would condensate and induce non - perturbative effects .",
    "that is , the hidden gauge sector @xmath73 sqcd including @xmath74 flavor fields with mass @xmath75 generates the non - perturbative superpotential @xmath76 where the mass scale should be higher than the dynamical scale , @xmath77 .",
    "we apply this to the @xmath55 hidden sector .",
    "then , the following non - perturbative superpotential would be generated , @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "that is the so - called racetrack superpotential .",
    "the stationary point in susy preserving vacuum can be evaluated by @xmath81 .",
    "the real part of the dilaton vev is approximately given by @xmath82 in figure [ fig : rt ] , we show the allowed region for @xmath83 for the dilaton vev around @xmath84 . for example , the minimal supersymmetric standard model with @xmath85 tev susy breaking scale leads to @xmath86 at the unified scale .",
    "it turns out that we need a hierarchy between @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the order of @xmath89 to realize a realistic value .    .",
    "the colored region shows range of the real part of the dilaton vev , @xmath84.,width=302 ]    at the above minimum , we can estimate @xmath90 thus , the dilaton mass is much heavier than the gravitino mass by a factor of @xmath91 .",
    "note that , at the stationary point , the vacuum energy has a negative value @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "this vacuum corresponds to susy anti de sitter vacuum . in the next subsection",
    ", we discuss uplifting by the susy breaking to realize @xmath94 .      here , we discuss the possibility for susy breaking and uplifting by the remaining hidden @xmath56 gauge sector .",
    "we have nine flavors of @xmath56 , @xmath95 , at the three - point coupling level in the superpotential .",
    "these fields are also expected to have an effective mass term from higher - dimensional operators , @xmath96 , and masses are given by a function of vevs of the scalar fields @xmath71 .",
    "their mass spectrum is again highly dependent on the details of the model .",
    "we assume that four flavors among the nine become light compared to the other five flavors , which decouple at low energy .",
    "we denote the light mass as @xmath97 .    under the above assumption",
    ", the @xmath56 hidden sector leads to the intriligator - seiberg - shih ( iss)-type of metastable susy breaking @xcite . according to seiberg duality @xcite ,",
    "@xmath98 sqcd with @xmath99 flavors is dual to the supersymmetric system of corresponding mesons @xmath100 and baryons , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . here",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 run the flavor space , @xmath105 . in the magnetic theory ,",
    "susy is spontaneously broken .",
    "the superpotential is given by @xmath106 here @xmath107 is a dynamical scale .",
    "the khler potential of @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 can be written by @xmath111 where the coefficients , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , are of @xmath85 . in the above superpotential ,",
    "the determinant term is negligible @xcite .",
    "the f - term associated with @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 and the f - flatness condition for all components of @xmath115 , @xmath117 , can not be satisfied simultaneously . then susy is spontaneously broken .",
    "furthermore , one - loop corrections ensure the stability of the vacuum .",
    "this susy breaking effect has the contribution on the vacuum energy @xmath118 up to @xmath85 factor .",
    "the life - time of the metastable vacuum is sufficiently long compared with that of our universe if @xmath119 is satisfied .",
    "then , we fine - tune the parameters such that the total vacuum energy is almost vanishing , @xmath120 . this fine - tuning relation leads to @xmath121 up to @xmath85 factor .",
    "note that the dilaton has heavy mass and it is stabilized even with the above uplifting potential ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in table [",
    "tab : parameters ] , we show several examples of possible choices of @xmath122 satisfying the above relation . we take the string scale @xmath123 .",
    "susy breaking scales are also represented by the gravitino mass @xmath124 . in the case of @xmath125",
    ", it turns out that the susy breaking scale becomes very light since the dynamical scale @xmath126 is very low .",
    "however , if we allow the dilaton vev to be less than or comparable to @xmath127 , we can achieve a suitable susy breaking scale , @xmath128 for instance .",
    "the range of the dilaton vev @xmath129 is acceptable since we have several vectorlike pairs in our effective theory as in table [ tab : mattercontents ] .",
    "they may also gain masses at some energy scale , and contribute to the running of gauge coupling constants as threshold corrections .",
    "we have studied dilaton stabilization by using an explicit model . in the asymmetric orbifold construction , since we start from a narain lattice , the resulting model has an enhanced gauge symmetry with rank 22 .",
    "thus this model has a relatively large hidden sector . in our explicit model",
    ", we have a semi - realistic visible sector and a @xmath53 hidden sector . by the @xmath9 asymmetric orbifold action ,",
    "geometric moduli fields except the dilaton field are projected out in the effective theory .",
    "we found an explicit three - generation model with suitable hidden sector for dilaton stabilization by the racetrack mechanism .",
    "we also discussed the possibility for iss - type susy breaking and f - term uplifting toward the de sitter universe .",
    "the absence of geometric moduli fields and the existence of multiple hidden sectors with relatively large rank are common in other types of asymmetric orbifold constructions , e.g. @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "regarding the yukawa structure of our model , this model can not realize suitable particle masses since the charm quark is as heavy as the top quark mass .",
    "this is because our orbifold action is @xmath9 , resulting in a quark yukawa matrix that is far too simple . to address a realistic yukawa structure",
    ", we will consider model building by other types of orbifold actions , e.g. @xmath130 , in future work .",
    "few studies have been carried out on moduli stabilization in explicit and realistic models .",
    "thus , extending our study is important , although we have assumed mass scales and used free parameters . as one of the next issues",
    ", it is important to study which mass scales can be realized . for that purpose , we need to study generic higher dimensional operators .",
    "such studies were done in symmetric orbifold models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we will study its extension to asymmetric orbifold models elsewhere .",
