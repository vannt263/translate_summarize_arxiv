    "recommender systems play an important role in many online services and websites , including streaming video , music services and e - commerce sites . within such domains , recommender systems",
    "have often succeeded in improving a user s ability to discover desirable items and make informed choices .",
    "designing a successful recommendation system requires careful consideration not only of the machine learning algorithms that underlie the recommendations , but also of the interface through which users interact with the system and generate feedback data .",
    "this implies a complex design space of interface usability , incentives to generate data , feedback models , and learning algorithms .",
    "we explore this design space for the common scenario of decision making and recommendation in _ one - choice session - based _ tasks .",
    "we define these as tasks where ( a ) users have to make one choice from a large set of options , many of which may be unfamiliar to the user , and ( b ) the interaction scope is typically limited to one session .",
    "many practical tasks fall into this category , e.g. , choosing a movie to watch , comparison shopping , searching for a recipe to make , or picking a hotel .",
    "while we assume sessions span only one contiguous chunk of time in this paper , other definitions are possible as long as the context and goal of the user remains the same . for example , a user shopping for a laptop could complete the task over the span of a week , which could be considered a session where the boundaries of a session are task - based rather than time - based .",
    ".5     .5     in one - choice session - based tasks there are two important challenges .",
    "the first is to provide users with an interface that supports effective decision making by augmenting their cognitive abilities . assuming a model of bounded rationality @xcite , users are rational agents who want to maximize payoff but under resource constraints .",
    "one such resource is short - term memory , and it is well known from research in cognitive psychology that humans have very limited short - term memory @xcite and that memorizing information incurs a certain cost @xcite .",
    "interfaces should be designed to alleviate some of these limitations @xcite .",
    "the second challenge is to quickly and non - obtrusively understand a user s needs during a session , such that the recommendation system can provide high - quality recommendations . in order to do this , we need to obtain meaningful and plentiful information about the user s needs during the session .",
    "this implies that the interface should enable effective feedback collection while minimizing the additional effort that the user has to expend providing feedback .",
    "ideally , a system should encourage implicit feedback as a by - product of their normal information seeking interactions .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to improve both usability and feedback elicitation through the introduction of _",
    "shortlists_. a shortlist can be thought of as a form of digital memory  a temporary list of candidates that the user is currently considering .",
    "digital memory is the ability to keep information about the current state , such as interesting items , available in the interface .",
    "for example , during a session a user may add a few movies to the shortlist before making a final selection .",
    "shortlists are different from long - term lists , wish lists , queues or favorites which persist memory across different tasks ( i.e. , help populate a list of movies that a user plans to watch eventually ) .",
    "we believe that the session - based approach is more appropriate for situations where users make one - time decisions or are heavily influenced by the current context , e.g. , when making decisions in a group or on behalf of other people .",
    "this work makes the following three contributions .",
    "first , we introduce the idea of shortlists with the dual goal of supporting users in their task by enhancing system usability and making the decision process more transparent to the underlying recommender system through the generation of additional implicit feedback .",
    "second , we conduct a user study to investigate the impact of the availability of digital memory on the user s exploration behavior , quality of decisions , speed of decision making , cognitive ease of decision making , and overall preference and satisfaction . finally , we investigate whether shortlists lead to user behavior that improves the quality and quantity of implicit user feedback , and whether the use of shortlists therefore leads to better recommendations compared to sessions where the interface had no shortlist .",
    "overall , we conclude that shortlists remove cognitive constraints that hinder effective decision making , they improve user satisfaction with the system and the choices users make , and they encourage user behavior that provides valuable implicit feedback to improve recommendation performance .",
    "in order to study the impact of digital memory on user behavior , we conducted an in - lab user study with a controlled task setup . among the particular tasks that fall into the category of one - choice session - based tasks",
    ", we wanted to pick a task for the study that fulfilled two requirements .",
    "first , we wanted a sufficiently large inventory size .",
    "this is important since we want to emulate tasks where users are not familiar with all available options  necessitating exploration ; many real - life scenarios are of this nature .",
    "second , we wanted the type of task to be familiar to keep the task instructions to a minimum .",
    "the task of selecting a movie to watch from a streaming provider meets these two criteria  there are a large number of movies to choose from and most people have been exposed to the task as part of their recreational activities .      in our user study",
    ", we compare an interface where users were given no digital memory , as represented in figure  [ fig : interface_no_short ] , with an interface where session - based digital memory was available via a shortlist , as shown in figure  [ fig : interface_with_short ] . in both interfaces",
    ", users could use facets to filter the current view of movies \\{1 } and could use navigation buttons to scroll to the previous and first page \\{3a } ( next and last page \\{3b } ) of the list .",
    "the facets included drop - downs for year , genre , and review score ( on a five star scale ) .",
    "a click on a movie showed more details about the movie such a synopsis of the plot . a click on a movie s",
    "play button \\{2 } opened a final prompt that asked whether the movie was the user s final selection .",
    "in the interface with the shortlist ( figure  [ fig : interface_with_short ] ) , users could also add movies to a temporary shortlist , \\{5 } , while browsing .",
    "users could either drag and drop items from the main list into the shortlist , or click the add button \\{4}. items within the shortlist could be reordered and also removed .",
    "the shortlist interface was inspired by the observation that users often develop strategies for keeping some state in memory .",
    "for example , users reported opening multiple tabs in a browser to keep state , or adding items to a shopping cart just to ensure they will be able to remember them .",
    "to summarize , both interfaces possessed the same basic functionalities .",
    "the only difference is that the shortlist interface in figure  [ fig : interface_with_short ] provided the user a way to easily remember and return to items via a shortlist , whereas the interface in figure  [ fig : interface_no_short ] possessed no such feature .      at first glance",
    ", shortlists might be viewed as another form of shopping carts , or favorite lists .",
    "however , shortlists as introduced here are different in two important aspects .",
    "first , the purpose of a shortlist is to aid a user in decision making rather than to aid him collect a set of items that he is eventually going to buy .",
    "these shortlists simply provide a temporary way of keeping track of items that a user found interesting in the current session , in contrast to favorite lists which express long - term interest .",
    "second , shortlists are visible all the time , making explicit consideration of and comparison with all previously viewed items much easier . in contrast to a simple history of viewed items ,",
    "shortlists were manually curated and only contained items that users expressed explicit interest in .      ]",
    "the overall design is depicted in figure  [ fig : study_layout ] .",
    "there were two different _ blocks _ , consisting of four _ sessions _ each .",
    "the type of interface ( no shortlist or shortlist ) was held constant within a block , but varied across blocks . during each session , users had to pick a movie from a new set of 1030 movies .",
    "there was a 3-minute break after the first block , but no further breaks in between sessions .",
    "the sets of movies displayed in each session were disjoint ; this was done to prevent a user from learning about available inventory from a previous session .",
    "users were also told that these sets were different .",
    "the order and the sets of movies in each session was the same across all users .",
    "users were given the following task statement :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ imagine a very good friend you havent seen in a year is coming to your place to visit . after hanging out for a while",
    ", you plan to watch a movie together . in this experiment",
    ", you ll be asked to select a movie to watch with your friend . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    users were also asked to keep the same friend in mind for the entire experiment .",
    "this prompt was given to emphasize a type of task where session - based preferences play a larger role than long - term preferences .",
    "in the future , we would like to study tasks which focus on long - term preferences .",
    "we counter - balanced the order of the two conditions across users across conditions to start with a shortlist or not with equal probability . to familiarize users with each interface ,",
    "before each block we showed a brief video summarizing the main functionality of the interface they would use in the upcoming block .",
    "to summarize , each user performed four repetitions of the same movie selection task with each of the two interfaces for a total of eight sessions per user . whether the user first experienced",
    "the no shortlist or shortlist interface was randomized and balanced across all users .",
    "users completed surveys at the start and the end of the experiment , after each block and also after each session .",
    "the pre - experiment questionnaire asked for familiarity with the task and personal investment into the task .",
    "after each session , we asked for feedback on the final choice .",
    "the surveys after each block asked for the immediate experience with the interface and for self - reported strategies and goals . in the final questionnaire",
    ", we asked users to compare both interfaces and for their overall preferences .",
    "interfaces were referred to as `` first '' and `` second '' interface with an illustration similar to figure [ fig : interfaces ] to avoid framing biases from the wording .",
    "after the entire experiment , we debriefed users in a short oral session and asked them for any other comments they had on the experiment .",
    "we obtained the movie data from omdb , a free and open movie database .",
    "we only selected movies that appeared in the year 1980 or after and with sufficiently many votes on imdb ( 800 or more ) .",
    "this filtering step was done to ensure all movies had a general level of attractiveness and popularity .",
    "we partitioned this set of movies into eight ( non - overlapping ) subsets of size 1030 each ( for 8240 movies total ) .",
    "these partitions were held constant across users in the study .",
    "the order displayed to the user was first descending by year and then descending by imdb score .",
    "this was to ensure the no shortlist condition offered a reasonable baseline for the condition .",
    "note that with this default ordering users see recent highly - rated movies first .",
    "we recruited 60 people for the user study ; most were graduate students in stem fields .",
    "there were 15 female and 45 male participants , yielding a gender ratio of 25% to 75% .",
    "all users were given the same computer and monitor to avoid differences in hardware affecting user behavior .",
    "in this section , we address the impact of shortlists in terms of user outcome .",
    "the goal of our user study was to answer the following research questions :    1 .",
    "how is overall user satisfaction changed by the ability to shortlist ? when comparing an interface with a shortlist against an interface without , which one",
    "would users prefer ?",
    "how does the shortlist influence the perceived quality of decisions ?",
    "3 .   how do shortlists alter exploration ? more specifically ,",
    "do shortlists influence the time - to - decision or the number of items that were explored before making a decision ?    for the remainder of the paper , we will employ the following terminology .",
    "we refer to an item as _ displayed _ if an item was visible on the users viewport . in other words",
    ", this means an item was shown in the main list at some point during the session .",
    "for example , there are eight displayed items in figure  [ fig : interface_no_short ] .",
    "an _ examined _ item is an item which got clicked on by the user in order to open a detail page with more information such as a plot synopsis , reviews , etc .",
    "_ shortlisted _ items are items that the users added to the shortlist at some point during the session . as an example , there are four shortlisted items in figure  [ fig : interface_with_short ] .",
    "finally , a _ chosen _ item is the one item in a session that the user picked as his final choice . in total , each user had to choose eight movies , where four of them were chosen with shortlist support , and four of them were chosen without shortlist support .",
    "the following two subsections will present results for the user interface aspects  how do people like shortlists as interface components ?",
    "after that , we turn to the behavioral aspects , showing that shortlists do indeed change exploration and decision strategies",
    ".      one of the most important aspects for long - term engagement with a system is user satisfaction . at the end of the experiment , we asked users to indicate their relative preference with respect to the two interfaces on a five - point scale . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the interfaces were referred to as  first interface \" and  second interface \" to avoid framing biases from the wording .",
    "the results of this question are displayed in figure  [ fig : preferred_interface ] . the vast majority of users ( 52 ) either prefers or strongly prefers the interface with the shortlist ( @xmath0 ; binomial test ) .",
    "this is also in line with what users entered in the feedback section that allowed for free form text or told us during the debriefing session .",
    "users reported decreased cognitive load when they could save interesting items in the shortlist .",
    "another popular comment was that the shortlist helped users in their task by being able to compare items directly .",
    "we can also see the overall user satisfaction reflected in the number of times that they actually interact with the shortlist .",
    "of the 240 sessions where users had the shortlist interface ( four sessions per user , 60 users in total ) , people used shortlists in 224 cases . in other words , people used shortlists in over 93% of the sessions where it was available .",
    "this is despite the fact that using the shortlist was optional , and at no point in the study did we ask them to use any particular function of the user interface .",
    "the high repeat usage of the interface also indicates that there is repeated benefits that users get out of the shortlist .",
    ".most users employed shortlists in all sessions.[tbl : shortlist_usage ] [ cols=\">,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      in general , we see the results of the experiment as evidence for preferring user engagement over feedback discrimination ; i.e. , when designing interfaces , it pays off to think more about encouraging user engagement rather than discriminating different qualities of implicit feedback",
    ". it would be interesting for future research to investigate this question in more detail , i.e. , answering the question when exactly different quality levels of implicit feedback could be of use .",
    "our work in this paper is located in the intersection of human - computer interaction , psychology and machine learning .",
    "each aspect of shortlists draws ideas from a different area .",
    "the usability aspect of shortlists is most strongly related to hci , and we showed that user satisfaction under the shortlist interface is improved .",
    "research in cognitive psychology helps us understand why having an external memory aid supports decision making .",
    "lastly , from a machine learning perspective , shortlists are important as means to obtain more implicit feedback for learning",
    ". we will now discuss each of the related areas in more depth .    starting with hci",
    ", there are a number of systems that were designed with the goal of aiding people in decision making . as there is a large body of work on general decision support systems @xcite , we only discuss work pertaining to search and recommendation @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite propose a system for information retrieval tasks where a user model gets adapted during the search process , allowing the user to update feature weights after each query .",
    "we , in contrast , do not ask for explicit feedback in any form , but assume users are rational enough to only shortlist items that have relatively high utility .",
    "also in information retrieval , jia and niu @xcite propose an interface that helps people know when to stop exploring .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite present a visual way of supporting movie selection in groups  an interesting scenario we would like to like to study in the future .",
    "in contrast to their work , we propose shortlists not as an entire system to solve an end - to - end task , but rather as a component that provides digital memory .",
    "hence , our approach can be seen as complementary to these systems  one can imagine adding shortlists to them as an additional component .    from research in psychology , we know that there are clear limits on people s short term memories .",
    "numbers range from three up to nine chunks of information that could be held in memory at the same time @xcite .",
    "not only is the amount of information in short - term memory limited , but it also decays fairly quickly if not used ; decay times around 18 seconds have been reported in studies @xcite .",
    "shortlists are fighting these two limitations in parallel : users can both remember more items and recall them at any time of the session .",
    "the role of memory in recommender systems as well as the need for support for it is also further discussed by del missier @xcite . there is also a large body of research on decision making in psychology .",
    "jameson @xcite summarizes support principles for decision making in the context of recommendation in a high - level framework called arcade . in this framework , shortlists can be seen as realizations of two strategies .",
    "namely , shortlists may help _ advise _ the user in making better decisions by suggesting a winnowing approach to choice making , and shortlists can _ represent _ the current set of candidates a user is considering . in summary , we saw that shortlists have well motivated cognitive and psychological foundations .",
    "a key concern in machine learning is the availability of labeled data , often obtained in the form of human feedback .",
    "many machine learning approaches assume _ explicit _ feedback from the user .",
    "explicit feedback means that users are explicitly asked to provide some form of feedback on the output produced by a ml system @xcite .",
    "this is different from _ implicit _ feedback that is obtained as a by - product of the user interacting with a system .",
    "schemes for explicit feedback elicitation thus are all of an invasive nature , ranging from minimally to strongly invasive . on the minimal end of the spectrum , there are systems in information retrieval @xcite or recommendation @xcite",
    "that imagine that users provide optional feedback on items using a thumbs up or down mechanism .",
    "more invasive is active learning @xcite , where users are iteratively queried for more feedback and the system also decides which options a user needs to give feedback on .",
    "the main limitation of explicit feedback is that users are reluctant to give it since it provides no immediate benefit to them ; participation rates of under 1% were found in practice @xcite .",
    "implicit feedback overcomes data scarcity by relying on user actions .",
    "it assumes users reveal their interests through the actions they take .",
    "several methods try to harness this fact .",
    "for example , in information retrieval evaluation , implicit feedback is used to infer preferences for rankings @xcite .",
    "a line of work called gamification @xcite tries to set up _ external _ rewards ( e.g. , badges , leaderboards , etc . ) so that users will change their behavior accordingly .",
    "the interface that we introduce in this paper takes a different approach : we leverage the _ internal _ motivation of users to make good choices , and users receive immediate benefits ( decreased cognitive load , greater satisfaction ) when using the shortlist .",
    "lastly , there is a growing interest in recommendation and decision making on a session - based level .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite study decision making in recommendation systems for hotel search .",
    "the authors perform a user study where decision making happens either with the help of a recommender system or without .",
    "interestingly , they found that the number of examined items as well as the time - to - decision increased when users employed a recommender system .",
    "this again shows the need to consider both interface design and feedback elicitation at the same time . on the algorithmic side ,",
    "several approaches are designed to learn from session - based data @xcite .",
    "the work done by jannach _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also adopts a session - based approach to recommendation , but , in contrast to us , assumes that a long term interest profile is available . a challenge that we had to face was also to learn from multiple levels of implicit feedback .",
    "most work assumes that one has access to enough users so that graded relevance labels can just be integrated into standard collaborative filtering models @xcite .",
    "our approach did not assume that feedback was available from other users since we adopted a cold - start session - based scenario .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work studying shortlists as design patterns to improve both user satisfaction and feedback elicitation .",
    "we demonstrated empirically that users generate more implicit feedback , and that this feedback in turn can be used to improve recommendation quality .",
    "shortlists can be also seen as a bridge between the diverging goals of end users and system designers .",
    "although we only focused on movie recommendation , we believe that the concept of shortlists or even broader , digital memory , can be applied to a more general class of tasks , such as trip planning or online shopping . in these scenarios , it might be even more important to obtain more task - specific feedback since item inventories are changing constantly , and long - term preferences might not be sufficient .",
    "the idea of digital memory is also backed up by research in cognitive psychology , and we confirmed its effectiveness in our experiments .",
    "hence , digital memory is a valuable asset for interface design since it eases cognitive burden and incentives and engages users .",
    "interestingly , it was powerful enough to even change self - reported user behavior . instead of satisficing at the first minimally good item , many users adopted an explore - and - curate strategy under the shortlist interface .",
    "this evidence suggests that people s effort and task involvement is strongly coupled to the interface given ",
    "factors that are highly relevant for e - commerce applications .",
    "future work could study the use of digital memory in other scenarios that differ from the movie domain considered here  both in terms of domain knowledge and investment .",
    "for example , shortlists can be valuable in domains where the options are completely unknown to the user ( e.g. , restaurants in a new city ) since in these scenarios , there would be more emphasis on exploration .",
    "it would also be interesting to look at shortlist usage in domains where decisions involve a larger risk , e.g. , laptop shopping or job search .",
    "other interesting directions are the interplay of short - term interests , as reflected in shortlists , and long - term interests , for example given by a wish list .",
    "there is also the possibility of doing recommendation based on the entire content of shortlists , similar to next - basket recommendation for e - commerce websites @xcite .",
    "a possible use case of this would be to prepopulate a user s shortlist .",
    "we demonstrated the importance of designing recommender systems holistically in our user study .",
    "introducing shortlists yielded both improvements in user satisfaction and downstream recommendation performance .",
    "in particular , we saw that users preferred an interface with shortlist support , they were more satisfied with their choices and stay engaged longer when they had shortlist support .",
    "this engagement resulted in additional implicit feedback that improved the quality of recommendations by nearly a factor of two .",
