    "thermal condensation of diffuse gas is a commonly invoked route for the formation of dense astrophysical structures .",
    "this thermal condensation may occur spontaneously or may be induced by variations of the external conditions . in the first situation ( spontaneous condensation ) , the initially diffuse gas is in a state out of equilibrium in which the cooling dominates over the heating . eventually , the gas reachs a thermo - chemical equilibrium in a dense and cool state . in the second situation ( induced condensation ) , in absence of variation of external conditions the gas would reach ( or be in ) a state of thermo - chemical equilibrium in a diffuse and hot state , but in presence of appropriate variations of the external conditions , the gas evolves toward a cooler and denser state .",
    "induced condensation of diffuse gas must play an important role in the large scale evolution of the medium ; specially if the stimulating sources are able to induced condensation far away from them . the synchronization and the large scale patterns of star formation may be governed by this kind of stimulation .",
    "in fact , most of the models and numerical simulations of the star formation in disk galaxies include as a main process the so - called self - propagating star formation ( gerola & seiden 1978 ; seiden & gerola 1982 ; shore 1981 , 1983 ; palou et al .",
    "1990 ; comins & shore 1990 ; cammerer & shchekinov 1994 ) .",
    "this kind of systems are part of the wider class of reaction - diffusion systems ( kapral 1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the so - called exitable media are appropriate to capture the main features of the pattern formation in disk galaxies ( smolin 1996 ) .    among the external conditions",
    "whose variations would induce phase transitions are the external pressure and the ionizing flux .",
    "we focus our attention on the effect of the variation of the ionizing flux , keeping in mind that induced condensation by pressure variations may play a relevant role ( roberts 1969 ; shapiro & kang 1987 ) . in particular , we focus our attention on flash - like variations ; that is , during a `` short '' period of time , the ionizing flux is enhanced in comparison to the pre- and post - flash values . to illustrate this mechanism of induced condensation ,",
    "two examples are given here : one on the context of pregalactic conditions ( in a free metal cloud ) , and the other on the context of the actual interstellar medium ( in a gas with solar abundances ) . in both cases",
    "the cause of the induced phase change is the same : the increase in the electron density due to the momentary increase of ionizing flux enhances the cooling rate . after the passing of the flash , the cooling rate remains enhanced due to the inertia of the ionization ( i.e. the characteristic recombination time is much larger than the cooling one ) .",
    "+ many scenarios in which a flash of radiation affects the evolution of gas clouds can be imagined . for the metal free gas case ,",
    "this kind of induced condensation might be relevant at the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "in particular , the ionizing flash effect might be a key step in the sequence of events that have conduced to the formation of globular clusters .",
    "it has been stated by cox ( 1985 ) that `` such a rapid fragmentation of the halo almost certainly requires inducement by energy leaving the ( primitive ) disk '' . for the case of a gas with solar abundances ,",
    "the evoked mechanisms of induction are diverse but generally associated to compression and convergent mass flows ( see review by elmegreen 1992 ) .",
    "however , in addition to these mechanisms , the induced condensation by ionizing flashes appears as an effect to be considered .    in sec .",
    "2 the basic equations to follow the thermal and chemical evolution of a gas subject to variations of the gas pressure and the ionizing flux are given . in sec .",
    "3 the evolution of a free metal gas cloud subject to a flash of ionizing and dissociating radiation is analyzed , whereas , in sec .",
    "4 , the evolution of a solar abundance gas subject to a flash of cosmic ray flux is considered .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "the thermal and chemical evolution of a gas subjected to variable external conditions are calculated by solving the system of kinetic equations and the equation of energy conservation .",
    "the system of kinetic equations can be written in the general form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total number density of hydrogen nuclei and @xmath7 is the relative number density of the @xmath8-th species . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the formation and destruction rates of the @xmath8-th species due to double collisions , whereas , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the production and destruction rates of the @xmath8-th species due to the interaction of particles with radiation .    the equation of energy conservation equation can be expressed as @xmath13 where u is the internal energy by unit mass , @xmath14 is the net cooling rate by unit mass ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the pressure , @xmath17 is the mass density , and @xmath18 is the specific volume . assuming that @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with r the gas constant , and @xmath21 the molar mass , eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be written as @xmath22    two extreme situations that can be used to confine intermediate situations are the constant density and constant pressure approximations . in these approximations , the energy conservation equation can be expressed as @xmath23 where , @xmath24 or @xmath25 in the constant density or in the constant pressure approximations , respectively .",
    "variations of the external ionizing sources flux produces direct variation on the rates @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and on the heating rate @xmath26 , whereas , variations of the presure affect density and temperature .",
    "notice that variations of @xmath6 or @xmath12 provoke a variation of the chemical state of the gas , and therefore produce a variation of the cooling rate @xmath27 . in the following ,",
    "we solve the basic equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with the appropriate assumptions in order to model : a ) the evolution of a metal free cloud subjected to a variation of the ionizing and dissociating flux ( sec .",
    "3 ) , and b ) the evolution of a solar abundance gas subjected to variations of the primary ionization rate due to cosmic rays ( sec . 4 ) .",
    "in the context of formation of galaxies and globular clusters , the non - equilibrium formation of @xmath0 has been identified as a key process for achieving a rapid cooling bellow @xmath28 ( palla & stahler 1983 ; izotov & kolesnik 1984 ; shapiro & kang 1987 ; palla & zinnecker 1987 ; kang et al . 1990 ; anninos et al .",
    "1996 ; padoan et al .",
    "1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand , the ionization and dissociation of primordial gas by uv background radiation have been taken into account as an important parameter in many studies of the thermo - chemical evolution of pregalactic and intergalactic structures ( kang et al .",
    "1990 ; donahue & shull 1991 ; ferrara & giallongo 1996 ; haardt & madau 1996 ; navarro & steinmetz 1996 ; mucket & kates 1997 ) . in general , the uv background radiation acts as an inhibitor of @xmath0 formation . however , there are exceptions to this rule .",
    "recently haiman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that uv background radiation can enhance the formation of @xmath0 in primordial gas at high densities ( @xmath29 ) and low temperatures ( @xmath30 ) ; but for densities lower than the above value , the effect of a _ constant _ uv background radiation is to inhibit the @xmath0 formation . as it will be shown in the present section , rapid variations of the uv background radiation",
    "can also enhance the non - equilibrium formation of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention on flash like variations capable of heating and increasing the ionization fraction of an initially warm - neutral gas cloud near thermo - chemical equilibrium . after the passing of the radiation pulse ,",
    "the enhanced ion fraction makes the gas phase formation of @xmath0 molecules possible by the creation of the intermediaries @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the presence of small quantities of @xmath0 molecules then makes possible further radiative cooling to temperatures as low as @xmath31 .",
    "the rapid cooling ( @xmath32 free - fall times ) abruptly reduces the jeans mass by a factor @xmath33 , permitting the fragmentation of clouds initially marginally stable .",
    "izotov ( 1989 ) has considered the homogeneous contraction approach of a gravitational unstable cloud , but here we are interested in delimiting the necessary conditions that provoke the rapid cooling of the cloud without invoking the gravitational collapse . uv",
    "radiation pulses have similar effects than shock waves because the post - shock flow also recombines out of equilibrium .",
    "the spectrum , amplitude and duration of the radiation pulse are free parameters in our model .",
    "however , it should be noticed that , in order to induce efficient @xmath0 cooling in the cloud , the detailed form of the flash is not important as long as that , during the flash , the ionization of the cloud increases appreciably and after this , the ionizing flux decreases to background values in a short time compared to the recombination time .",
    "the initial conditions of the cloud and the characteristics of the hypothetic ionizing pulse depend on the chosen scenery .",
    "for example in the fall and rees ( 1985 ) scenery , during the proto - galactic collapse , if the gas is assumed to be lumpy , the overdense regions will cool more rapidly than the underdense regions producing a two - phase medium .",
    "but the developing rate of this overdense regions depends on the initial conditions ( i.e. the denser regions develop faster ; murray and lin 1990 ) and on their interaction with the system .",
    "thus , a dependence of the density contrast and of the mean cloud masses on the galactocentric distance are expected .",
    "the assumption of an ionizing flash produced in the galactic nucleus implicitly assumes a radial increment of the delay in the evolution of the clouds relative to the center .",
    "the dilution and attenuation of the ionizing and dissociating radiation produced in the flash also introduce a radial dependence .",
    "in fact , the possibility that proto - galactic structures are exposed to uv radiation emitted by massive young stars or an active galactic nucleus has been considered previously ( kang et al .",
    "therefore , it would be useful to know the dependence of the cloud evolution on the flash characteristics , and on the cloud initial state ( i.e cloud mass ( @xmath34 ) , temperature ( @xmath35 ) , number density ( @xmath6 ) , and the relative number density of the species ( @xmath7 ) .    to follow the thermal and chemical evolution of a metal - free cloud in presence of a variable radiation flux",
    ", we consider an idealized uniform cloud .",
    "the gas model adopted for this application considers the following 9 species : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath1 , @xmath39 , @xmath0 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . assuming a mass fraction @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) of helium relative to hydrogen , then @xmath45 , where @xmath7 is the ratio of the number density of species @xmath8 to the total number density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath6 .",
    "the processes of formation and destruction of these nine species are assumed to be the 24 reactions in table i of rosenzweig et al .",
    "the adopted cooling rates , include : 1 ) the collisional ionization of @xmath36 by electron impact ; 2 ) the free - free transitions of @xmath46 ( izotov ( 1989 ) and references therein ) ; 3 ) the collisional ionization by electron impact of @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; 4 ) the free - free transitions of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; 5 ) the total dielectronic cooling rate of @xmath41 ( shapiro & kang 1987 ) ; 6 ) the @xmath47 cooling rates due to rotational and vibrational transitions excited by ( @xmath48 ) and ( @xmath49 ) collisions , calculated according to lepp and shull ( 1983 ) .",
    "these @xmath47 cooling rates must be multiplied by a factor @xmath50 and @xmath51 to take into account the escape probability of the vibrational and rotational photons , respectively .",
    "finally , 7 ) the excitation of the @xmath47 vibrational levels ( @xmath52 ) by low energy electron - impact was taken into account ( klonover & kaldor , 1979 ) . + the external radiation flux affects the photoionization of the hydrogen and helium , and the @xmath0 photo - dissociation ( and its associated heating rates ; see rosenzweig et al .",
    "the external photon flux is assumed to have the quasar - like distribution ( shapiro and kang 1987 ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the h lyman - edge frequency .",
    "the function @xmath55 is introduced to represent the changes of the flux level outside the cloud , and is assumed to behave as @xmath56 in the lyman continuum , and as @xmath57 for the photo - dissociating photons . since a homogeneous cloud is assumed in this application , the optical depth at its center , for the ionizing radiation , can be written as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass of the cloud in units of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the absorption cross sections of species @xmath8 at frequency @xmath62 . as a first approximation",
    ", the attenuation of the external radiation field @xmath63 by the factor @xmath64 is adopted to schematize the opacity effects . for the dissociating radiation field a similar approximation is adopted ( rosenzweig et al .",
    "obviously , by using this first approximation , the effect of the ionizing radiation is minimized , and the study of the internal structure of the cloud is not possible .    for the time dependence of the flux level @xmath65",
    "we assume a flash like variation .",
    "more precisely , during a first period of integration the external radiation flux remains at the assumed background value ( i.e. @xmath66 ) .",
    "the duration of this initial period of integration is large enough ( i.e. @xmath67 yr ) to ensure that the cloud is near its thermo - chemical equilibrium state .",
    "after this first period of stabilization , it is assumed that both , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , increase linearly to the value @xmath70 in a time @xmath71 , and remains at this value during a time @xmath72 .",
    "then , the flux level is assumed to decrease exponentially with a characteristic time @xmath73 to the background value @xmath74 for the ionizing flux , and to @xmath75 for the dissociating flux .",
    "this kind of flux variations are expected in the case when the radiation pulse is assumed to be produced by an intense but short event of stellar formation or by the radiation coming from a front shock . in a few million years after the end of the stellar formation process , the ionizing flux is expected to decrease to background values . on the other hand , due to the contribution of intermediate and low mass stars to the dissociating flux , it is expected that its level remain higher than the background value ( @xmath76 ) long after the death of massive stars .    for a given initial state of the cloud , there is a critical background flux level @xmath77 , bellow which the cloud spontaneously cools because the self - shielding allows the formation of @xmath0 at relatively high concentrations .",
    "this critical background flux level is mainly sensible to the initial ion fraction due to its strong influence on the @xmath0 formation rate . in order to describe this initial state dependence , it is useful to look at the thermo - chemical equilibrium ( tce ) curve ( i.e. @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ) . figure ( 1.a )",
    "shows the tce curves for two different values of the background flux level ( lower curve @xmath80 , and upper curve @xmath81 ) when the mass of the cloud is @xmath82 .",
    "note the three phase structure characterized by the presence of three stable branches ( solid lines ) denoted in fig .",

    "( i.e. warm - ionized ; @xmath83 ) ,",
    "w - n ( i.e. warm - neutral ; @xmath84 ) , and c - n ( i.e. cool - neutral ; @xmath85 ) .",
    "note also the qualitative difference of the tce curve for low ( @xmath80 ) and high ( @xmath81 ) background flux level .",
    "that is , for @xmath81 the left - hand maximum ( denoted as @xmath86 ) is over the right - hand maximum ( denoted as @xmath87 ) , whereas , @xmath88 for @xmath80 .",
    "this difference is important because if the cloud is initially in tce in the w - i branch , and the pressure is progressively increased from @xmath89 to @xmath90 a transition to the w - n phase occurs in the case @xmath80 , but in the case @xmath81 the c - n phase is reached . for @xmath80 , fig .",
    "( 1.b ) shows the typical isobaric evolution tracks for initially ionized states ( arrows a , b , c and d ) and for initially neutral states ( arrows e , f and g ) . for cases a , b , and d , as expected the cloud evolves toward the stable branch w - i , w - n , and c - n , respectively .",
    "however , in case c , even when @xmath91 the track reaches the c - n branch transversing the w - n branch due to the inertia of the ionization fraction .",
    "more precisely , the excess of the ionization fraction shifts the maximum pressure @xmath87 of the corresponding thermal equilibrium curve to a value bellow the pressure corresponding to case c. on the other hand , for the initially neutral states the evolution is substantially different . in case e the track stops in the w - n branch ; note the difference with case c. in case f the cooling rate is so small that in practice the cloud reaches a quasi - stationary state similar to that in the w - n branch .",
    "the small cooling efficiency is due to the very small @xmath0 formation rate for the low ion fraction in the quasi - stationary w - n state .",
    "finally , for high enough gas pressure as in case g , the cloud reaches the c - n branch .",
    "the isobaric evolution tracks for a high background flux level ( i.e. @xmath81 ) are similar to those in fig ( 1.b ) except that the w - n branch can not be reached from an ionized initial state as in case b in fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the cloud is in the quasi - stationary state schematized by track f , a large enough ionizing flash is able to increase @xmath0 formation rate and to stimulate the rapid condensation to reach the c - n branch .    the analysis of the various evolution tracks in fig .",

    "that an increase of the background flux level shift the tce curve upward , a similar analysis can be made for a fixed pressure but varying the background flux level .",

    "if @xmath73 is short enough , the gas has an excess of electrons and thermal energy compared with the equilibrium values corresponding to @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "after the lapse of uv flux decrement , recombination continues , but at a lower rate than the cooling .",
    "the excess of electrons at these relatively low temperatures results in an enhancement of the @xmath0 rate formation .",
    "even when @xmath151 , the abundance of @xmath0 may reach a large enough value to produce considerable self - shielding .",
    "if the cloud reaches a critical value ( @xmath152 ) for the optical depth at dissociating frequencies , the @xmath0 abundance grows very fast , allowing the cooling of the cloud to temperatures of the order of @xmath153 .",

    "( 4 ) , where the flash induce rapid cooling even when @xmath154 . on the other hand , for case ( c )",
    "a post flash dissociating level with @xmath155 is enough to inhibit the formation of @xmath0 , and then , the cloud remains warm .",
    "a detailed study of the dependence of the cloud evolution on the phase space of free parameters ( cloud mass , initial conditions , and flash characteristics ) is out of the scope of this simple application .",
    "however , such detailed study may reveal that the stimulating condensation process studied here can be effective in a restricted region of the free parameters space , and therefore , may act as a selective effect that contributes to the formation of dense structures at certain scales .",
    "among the various processes that determine the change of state of the ism material , phase transitions are expected to play an important role . in particular ,",
    "warm to cool phase transition has been indicated as a channel to transform diffuse gas ( @xmath156 ) into denser states ( @xmath157 ) ( field , goldsmith & habing 1969 ; lepp et al .",
    "1985 ; parravano 1987 ; lioure & chize 1990 ; dickey & brinks 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , it has been proposed ( parravano 1988 , 1989 ) that the large scale star formation rate must be self - regulated because , on one hand the warm gas condensation is inhibited by high enough uv radiation ( coming mainly from massive stars ) , and on the other hand , a gas supply from the diffuse phases is required to feed the large scale star formation process . in this way , the large scale star formation rate is limitated , and the warm gas tends to remains close the critical state for warm to cool phase transition .",
    "the fact that large quantities of ism warm gas remain close to this critical state allows the trigger of condensation by relatively small variations of the ambient conditions .",
    "more precisely , the mean `` distance '' of the warm gas state to the critical state for spontaneous condensation is determined by the amplitude spectrum of the variations of the ambient conditions . in any case , the study of triggered condensation of warm gases close to the critical state can be justified by the self - regulatory hypothesis .",
    "it is to be noticed that the scale of the inhibitory process is expected to be much larger than the scale of the triggering processes : a fact that apparently is a common characteristic of many dynamical systems where spiral structures arise ( smolin 1996 ) .    triggering mechanisms of star formation",
    "are usually related to compression and pushing of the ism gas by high pressure events associated to stars formed previously ( reviews on this topic can be found in elmegreen 1992 , franco 1992 ) .",
    "also , compression of the warm gas by the spiral density wave have been evocated as a main trigger of its condensation ( roberts 1969 ) ; however , stimulated condensation by ionizing flashes may also enter as an initiator of the chain of processes that finally results in the formation of stars . as it will be shown bellow ,",
    "this stimulating mechanism is particularly efficient when the warm gas state is close to its marginal state for spontaneous phase transition .",
    "moreover , variations of the ionizing flux are expected to precede pressure variations if both variations are associated to the same perturbing event .",
    "large local variation of the ionizing rate are expected to be present in the interstellar medium .",
    "sudden appearance and disappearance of ionizing sources occur continuously in the galactic plane .",
    "also , `` rapid '' variation of the opacity to the ionizing radiation in a line of seeing is expected .",
    "finally , variations of the cosmic ray flux are expected to be present due to variations of the sources ( cosmic ray acceleration in shock fronts with oblique b - fields ; blandford and ostriker 1978 ) , and to variations of the magnetic field topology ( i.e. focalization or dis - focalization of the cosmic ray stream in a region ) .",
    "it was also proposed ( ko & parker 1989 ; nozakura 1993 ) that star formation controls dynamo activities and hence large scale magnetic fields of disk galaxies .",
    "the cooling of the diffuse warm interstellar gas is mainly due to electron collisional excitation of a ) fine structure levels and metastable states of the positive ions @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 , and b ) @xmath162 excitation .",
    "therefore , an increase of the ionizing flux ( and the consequent increase of the electron density ) tends to reduce the gas temperature if the increase of the cooling efficiency overcomes the associated increase of the heating .",
    "in general , this is the case for low equilibrium ionization fractions when the kinetic energy of the electrons that result from the ionization process is small .",
    "depending on the value of the pressure and on the increase of the ionizing flux , the new thermal equilibrium state might be located in the cool neutral branch .",
    "that is : sufficiently large variations of the ionizing rate are expected to provoke the warm to cool phase transition . moreover ,",
    "if the ionizing flux variation has a flash - like variation , then , after the passing of the flash , the cooling rate remains enhanced due to the inertia of ionization .    in order to illustrate this effect , we consider variations of the primary ionization rate by cosmic rays @xmath163 which is the accepted main source of ionization of the interstellar warm gas far away from massive stars",
    ". other mechanisms of ionization have been proposed ( i.e. ob stars ( reinolds & cox 1992 ) , the neutrino decay theory ( sciama 1990 , 1993 ) ) , but for the present analysis the exact mechanism of ionization is not relevant . what is important here is the variation of the ionizing and heating rates due to a change of the considered ionizing flux .",
    "the main changes of the curve of thermo - chemical equilibrium ( tce ) when @xmath163 is changed are summarized in fig .",
    "( 5 ) , where the maximal ( @xmath164 ) and the minimal ( @xmath165 ) pressures of the tce curve are plotted as a function of @xmath163 .",
    "all the results in this section correspond to the standard solar neighborhood far uv energy density and gas composition .",
    "the labels are used to remind that if @xmath166 ( or @xmath167 ) then there is only one possible state of tce in the diffuse and warm phase ( or in the dense and cool phase ) .",
    "if @xmath168 then the gas may reach any of the two stable branches ( the warm or the cool branch ) . if the gas is initially in tce at the warm branch ( for example with the external conditions ( @xmath169 ) corresponding to the point ( a ) in fig . (",
    "5 ) , then , the gas could be forced to evolve toward the cool branch if the external conditions are changed , for example , to ( @xmath170 ) corresponding to the point ( b ) .",
    "the typical time for the transition from the warm to the cool branch is @xmath171 yr . once the gas reaches the cool phase , the external conditions can change again to ( @xmath169 ) but the gas will remain in the cool branch . to drive the gas to the warm phase again ,",
    "the external conditions must be changed , for example , to ( @xmath172 ) corresponding to the point ( c ) in fig .",
    "now , the gas could return to the initial state if the external conditions changes to the initial condition ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "the phase transitions described above assume that the time between the consecutive changes of @xmath163 are long enough to reach tce . if the variation of @xmath163 occurs before tce is achieved , then , the phase transition does not necessarily occur . here",
    "we will consider the effect of flash - like variations of @xmath163 at constant pressure .",
    "that is , at the beginning we assume that the gas is in the warm branch in the equilibrium state corresponding to the external conditions ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "then , @xmath174 is increased abruptly by a factor @xmath175 during a lapse of time @xmath176 , after which the primary ionization rate by cosmic rays returns to the initial value @xmath177 . as mentioned above , a fact that favors the phase transition is that the recombination time is much larger than the cooling time ; then after the end of an ionizing pulse , the cooling rate remains enhanced due to the non - equilibrium excess of electrons .    in this simple analysis",
    "we neglect non - local processes as thermal conduction , cosmic ray attenuation , radiative transfer , and gas dynamics",
    ". only local processes of radiative cooling , heating , h ionization and recombination are considered ( parravano 1986 ) , assuming that the pressure remains constant during evolution .",
    "the neglected non - local processes may play an important role in the local evolution of the gas and in should determine the spatial variations of the physical variables .",
    "however , here we are interestested in showing that the inertia of ionization ( after the passing of the ionizing pulse ) can , in many cases , enhance sufficiently the cooling efficiency to produce a phase transition from the warm gas phase to the cool phase .",
    "the evolution of the temperature and the ionization degree is calculated by solving simultaneously the energy conservation equation ( 2 ) , and the kinetic equation ( 1 ) restricted to the hydrogen ionization - recombination processes .    in order to show the effect of ionizing pulses , fig .",
    "( 6 ) shows the evolution at constant pressure of a warm gas initially in thermo - chemical equilibrium close to the critical state for spontaneous condensation .",
    "the pressure @xmath178 is bellow @xmath164 by a factor @xmath179 , when the pre - flash primary ionization rate is @xmath180 .",
    "the three curves in fig .",
    "( 6 ) correspond to the evolution for three different values of the pulse duration @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 myr , when the flash is initiated at @xmath184 yr and the factor of increment of @xmath174 is @xmath185 .",
    "note in fig .",
    "( 6 ) that there is a critical value of @xmath176 bellow which condensation does not occur ( in this case @xmath186 myr ) .",
    "note also that the time required to complete the phase transition decreases as @xmath176 increase , but the time required for the temperature drop from @xmath187 to @xmath188 is insensitive to @xmath176 .",
    "the kink at the bottom of the @xmath189 and @xmath183 curves , and the smooth dip in the @xmath181 curve are due to the inertia of the ionization fraction ( the recombination time is much longer for the conditions corresponding to the upper curve ) .    in fig .",
    "( 7 ) the critical values of @xmath175 are plotted as function of @xmath176 for the three labeled values of @xmath190 .",
    "these curves divide the plane @xmath191 in two regions : above the curves the flash is capable of inducing phase transition , and bellow the curve the gas returns to its initial state after the passing of the flash .",
    "note that a cosmic ray pulse with a factor of increment @xmath175 of the order of @xmath192 , and a duration of about one myr can induce the condensation of the warm gas in tce at @xmath193 .",
    "the variation of the ionizing flux as a mechanism for stimulating the condensation of the diffuse gas was considered . to illustrate this effect ,",
    "two situations were examined : one on the context of pregalactic conditions ( a free metal cloud ) , and the other on the context of the actual interstellar medium ( a gas with solar abundances ) .",
    "we have focused our attention on flash - like variations ; that is , during a `` short '' period of time the ionizing flux is enhanced in comparison to the pre and post flash values . in both cases",
    "the cause of the induced phase change is the same : the enhancement of the cooling rate by the increase of the electron density caused by the momentary increase of ionizing flux .",
    "after the passing of the flash , the cooling rate remains enhanced due to the inertia of the ionization . in the first case ( metal free gas )",
    "we show that after the lapse of uv flux decrement , recombination continues , but at a lower rate than the cooling .",
    "the excess of electrons at these relatively low temperatures results in an enhancement of the @xmath0 rate formation due to the enhanced abundance of the @xmath1 intermediary .",
    "even when @xmath151 , the abundance of @xmath0 may reach a large enough value to produce considerable self - shielding .",
    "if the cloud reaches a critical value ( @xmath152 ) for the optical depth at dissociating frequencies , the @xmath0 abundance grows very fast , allowing the cooling of the cloud to temperatures of the order of @xmath153 .",
    "the temperature drop occurs in a fraction ( @xmath32 ) of the free fall time provoking a rapid decrease of the jeans mass .",
    "however , if the post - flash dissociating level is large enough the @xmath0 formation can be inhibit and the cloud remains warm .    in the second case ( solar abundances gas )",
    "the dominant cooling mechanism of the warm neutral gas ( the excitation of heavy ions by electron impacts ) is proportional to the electron density , and therefore , the ionizing flash increases the cooling efficiency .",
    "we considers flash - like variations of the primary ionization rate by cosmic rays and calculate the marginal flash characteristics to induce warm gas condensation .",
    "we show that , for the expected states of the warm interstellar gas , ionizing flashes may easily induce the phase transition from the warm to the cool phase .",
    "the phase transition is completed in about @xmath194 yr ; however , the drop in the temperature from @xmath187 to @xmath188 occurs in about @xmath195 yr .",
    "the results indicate that the mechanism of induced condensation studied here might play a relevant role in the gas evolution of the diffuse gas in both , the pregalactic and the actual interstellar medium conditions .",
    "the above results include only local processes .",
    "however , non - local processes like thermal conduction impose restrictions on the size of the condensing structures .",
    "thermal conduction tends to attenuate temperature gradients , and therefore , it imposes a minimal value for the mass of the condensing structures ( corbelli & ferrara 1995 ; ibez & rosenzweig 1995 ; steele & ibez 1997 ) .",
    "critical masses of the order of galaxy masses are obtained in the case of a metal - free gas ( ibez & parravano 1983 ) and in the case of an actual interstellar gas , masses of the order of one solar mass are obtained ( parravano 1986 ; parravano , ibez & mendoza 1993 ) .",
    "however , a wide range of critical masses are obtained depending on the initial gas state , and ambient conditions .",
    "therefore , in addition to the restrictions on @xmath175 and @xmath176 to induce the warm gas condensation , the cosmic ray flash should cover a region greater than the critical value imposed by thermal conduction and other diffusive processes .",
    "we are very greatful to the referee a. ferrara for his useful comments that motivated us to include helium in the metal free model and to clarify the discussion by including the phase diagram .",
    "this work has been supported by cdcht and calculations were performed at cecalcula , both institutuons of the universidad de los andes ."
