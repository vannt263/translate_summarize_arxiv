    "hydra a ( 3c 218 ) is a high luminosity fanaroff - riley type i ( fr i ) radio galaxy .",
    "existing radio maps at frequencies greater than 5 ghz have mapped only the central , bright portions of the source .",
    "the inner jets extend for roughly @xmath8 along an axis at @xmath9 , and exhibit a high degree of `` s '' symmetry , which taylor et al .",
    "( 1990 ) suggest may be due to precession of the central engine .",
    "very long baseline array ( vlba ) maps at 1.3 , 5 , and 15 ghz also show a highly symmetric source on parsec scales , while vlba measurements of hi absorption against the core suggest an hi disk with a height of @xmath10 pc and a rotation axis which is aligned with the jet axis ( taylor 1996 ) .",
    "measurements with the very large array ( vla ) did not find any hi absorption against the kpc - scale jets ( dwarakanath , owen , & van gorkom 1995 ) .",
    "the source has been mapped with low angular resolution ( @xmath11 ) at 1500 mhz ( taylor et al .",
    "1990 ) , revealing a far more extended structure which covers nearly @xmath4 in a north - south direction , but obscuring its details .",
    "hydra a has not been studied in detail at any lower radio frequencies .",
    "the host system is identified as a cd galaxy ( matthews , morgan , & schmidt 1964 ) with a double optical nucleus ( ekers & simkin 1983 ) .",
    "it is the dominant member of the poor abell cluster a780 ( abell 1958 ) , and lies at a redshift @xmath12 ( dwarakanath et al .",
    "1995 ; owen , ledlow & keel 1995 ; taylor 1996 ) .",
    "a central gas disk , as measured by optical emission lines , has a rotation axis of @xmath13 ( eg .",
    "simkin 1979 ) , in good agreement with the kpc - scale radio jet axis .",
    "the cluster is a strong x - ray source and has been classified as a cooling flow cluster with a mass accretion rate of @xmath14 m@xmath15 yr@xmath16 ( david et al .",
    "2001 ) . using data from the chandra telescope , sambruna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find a point source which is spatially coincident with the radio core , embedded in a diffuse x - ray halo .",
    "they interpret this as evidence for a low luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , with most of its optical / uv emission obscured by intrinsic reddening .",
    "the high symmetry and near - unity jet - counterjet ratios of the core structures in the vlba maps suggest that hydra a is aligned within a few degrees of the plane of the sky on parsec scales ( taylor 1996 ) .",
    "however a strong faraday rotation measure ( rm ) and asymmetry in both the rm and depolarization between the kpc - scale jets suggest an inclination angle of @xmath17 ( taylor & perley 1993 ) , with the northern jet lying closer to us .",
    "the difference in these measurements may be explained if the jet gas either undergoes a sharp bend or is moving non - relativistically .",
    "here we present moderate resolution maps of hydra a at three low - radio frequencies : @xmath0 mhz , @xmath1 mhz , and @xmath2 mhz . throughout this paper we use h@xmath18 km",
    "s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , and define spectral index @xmath19 such that s@xmath20 .",
    "hydra a was observed in the c- and d - configurations of the vla at frequencies near 1415 mhz in 1988/1989 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the observations were made in a continuum mode , with bandwidths of 12.5 mhz .",
    "the original goal of these observations was to study the polarization properties of the source .",
    "we have re - reduced and imaged the data using standard routines in the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the majority of the flux at this frequency lies in the inner jets . in order to better",
    "map the lower flux density features of the weak extended lobes , we improved our dynamic range with a baseline correction , which we calculated using the observed primary flux calibrators 3c  286 and 3c  147 .",
    "the final image ( see figure  [ fig : hydl ] ) has a resolution of @xmath21 at a position angle of @xmath22 .",
    "the noise in the map remains limited by the dynamic range , which is 5500:1 .",
    "in addition , incomplete uv - coverage has led to noise artifacts near the source .",
    "short observations in the a- , b- , and c- configurations of the vla were carried out at frequencies near 330 mhz on various dates between 1990 and 1998 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "most of these data were intended to provide phase - referencing information for simultaneous observations at 74 mhz .",
    "the observations were set up as multiple short integrations spread out over a wide hour angle range to provide good uv - coverage .",
    "standard calibration observations were used .",
    "the data were mapped in aips using wide - field imaging techniques , which correct for distortions in the image caused by the non - coplanarity of the vla over a wide field of view ( the 3-d effect ) by using a set of small overlapping maps , or `` facets '' to cover the desired image area ( cornwell & perley 1992 ) .",
    "the rms noise in the final image is limited by the dynamic range of 5000:1 ( see figure  [ fig : hydp ] ) .",
    "the dataset has a maximum resolution of @xmath23 . in order to more clearly show the extended lobe emission we have chosen a display resolution of about @xmath24 .",
    "observations at 74 mhz were made in the a - configuration of the vla on 2002 april 29 for 4.2 hours .",
    "these data were taken as part of a program to observe the galaxy cluster abell 754 which is located @xmath25 from hydra a , well within the primary beam of the antennae at 74 mhz , which have a full - width at half maximum of @xmath26 .",
    "the data were taken in spectral - line mode to help with radio frequency interference excision , and the total bandwidth is 1.56 mhz .",
    "observations and models of cygnus a were used to correct the bandpass and set the antenna gains .",
    "the data were averaged to a channel resolution of 97.7 khz and imaged using the wide - field imaging technique described above .",
    "one of the individual facets was centered on hydra a : it is this image we present in figure  [ fig : hyd4 ] .",
    "the dynamic range in the image is 1450:1 , and the rms noise after correcting for the attenuation of the primary beam is 67 mjy bm@xmath16 .",
    "the angular resolution is @xmath27 at a position angle of @xmath28 .",
    "maps at all three frequencies do not resolve the core , but show the inner bright jets extending north and south to cover @xmath29 ( 100 kpc ) , and longer , outer jets extending @xmath30 ( 265 kpc ) .",
    "the jets are then seen to bend sharply and expand into diffuse , extended lobes .",
    "the northern lobe is seen at all three radio frequencies , while the southern lobe is visible only at the two lower frequencies .",
    "the entire structure covers roughly @xmath4 ( 530 kpc ) in a north - south direction , and displays an `` s''-shaped appearance .",
    "previous higher frequency observations did not detect the extended diffuse radio lobes in this source ( eg . taylor et al .",
    "this is not completely a surprise given that the radiative lifetime of the particles is longer at lower frequencies .",
    "although there is currently insufficient data at appropriate sensitivity and resolution combinations to determine if such extended structure is typical of fr1 s as a class , it has been observed in a few other objects ( eg . , m87 ; owen , eilek & kassim 2000 ) .",
    "in order to enable a direct comparison between data at different frequencies , the uv - data were limited in uv - range to @xmath31 , and tapered to match the dirty beams as closely as possible at each frequency .",
    "an identical clean beam of @xmath32 at a position angle of @xmath33 was used to restore the maps .",
    "the images were then aligned , clipped at a @xmath34 level , and combined to create spectral index images ( see figure  [ fig : hydsi ] ) .",
    "errors were estimated based on a combination of the signal to noise ratio at a given pixel , and the assumption of a @xmath35 amplitude calibration accuracy at each frequency .",
    "we assume that at these frequencies there are no significant flux density variations in the source over the 14 years spanned by the data .",
    "the spectral index between 1415 and 330 mhz is @xmath36 near the core of the source .",
    "the northern jet spectral index changes slowly to @xmath37 at @xmath38 and then reaches @xmath39 as it turns and broadens into the northern lobe .",
    "in contrast , the southern jet slope steepens quickly from @xmath40 at @xmath41 , to @xmath42 at @xmath38 .",
    "the southern lobe is not reliably detected by the 1415 mhz map .",
    "the 330 to 74 mhz spectral index at the core is @xmath43 . in the northern direction",
    "the spectral index decreases gradually to @xmath44 along the arm out to @xmath38 , and reaches @xmath45 in the northern lobe .",
    "the apparent small scale structure in the northern lobe is mostly due to low - level doconvolution artifacts in the 74 mhz image . on the southern side",
    ", the spectral index reaches @xmath46 at a distance of @xmath47 along the jets , and continues to decrease into the southern lobe , finally reaching @xmath48 .",
    "there are clear differences between the lower frequency ( 330 to 74 mhz ) spectral index and that at the higher frequency ( 330 to 1415 mhz ) at a given position within hydra a. in figure  [ fig : sicomp ] we plot a few representative positions along the northern and southern jets .",
    "the difference in spectral index is small but consistent , and significant at greater than a @xmath49 level .",
    "the spectral curvature follows an expected pattern ( e.g. , parma et al .",
    "2002 ) ; the spectral slope is steeper at higher frequencies due to aging of the relativistic particle spectrum over time .    on the other hand",
    "the spectral indices calculated from the total flux at each of our three frequencies indicate that the entire source has a spectral slope only slightly steeper than the `` typical '' extragalactic source spectral index of @xmath50 ( bridle & perley 1984 ) ; we find @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( errors are @xmath53 and we assume a @xmath35 flux calibration precision at each frequency ) . within the errors , there is little change in the spectral slope over this frequency range .",
    "these numbers are also consistent with previous estimates for spectral index in this source ( eg .",
    "@xmath54 ; khr et al .",
    "1981 ) . using @xmath55 to interpolate the 74 mhz total flux to 178 mhz",
    ", we find that hydra a has @xmath56 w hz@xmath16 sr@xmath16 .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous estimates for this source ( taylor 1996 ) .",
    "finally we note that the northern lobe has a flatter spectral slope than the southern lobe at a given separation from the nucleus .",
    "this is consistent with it being both the brighter side of the source and the less depolarized of the two lobes ( taylor 1996 ; garrington , conway , & leahy , 1991 ; liu & pooley , 1991 ) .",
    "it seems probable that the southern emission is turning away from us while the northern emission bends towards us .",
    "thus the geometry and spectral indices support the conclusion that hydra a is inclined to the plane of the sky , with the northern side lieing closer to us ( taylor 1996 ) .",
    "the northern jet exhibits a turn of about 90 degrees before it expands into a diffuse lobe , and the jet and lobe are clearly separated in the image .",
    "in contrast , the radio emission to the south appears to be bent around by nearly 180 degrees before it finally escapes to the east in a diffuse lobe .",
    "the steeper spectral slope in the southern jet could be caused by a superposition of the jet and lobe emission along the line of sight .",
    "it may also be related to the greater confinement of the radio source to the south .",
    "we present moderate resolution vla maps of hydra a at 74 , 330 and 1415 mhz .",
    "these new images reveal a complicated extended structure , only hinted at in previously published maps for this powerful fr i radio source .",
    "nulsen et al . (",
    "2002 ) show that the cool , x - ray emitting gas in the central region of hydra a extends beyond the 6 cm radio contours . a comparison to our new low frequency observations of hydra a shows that these cool regions roughly align with the larger scale radio emission . given the shape and well - defined border of the northern lobe",
    ", we suggest that it may in fact be filling a bubble in the x - ray gas , analogous to buoyant structures inferred to exist in clusters such as perseus a ( fabian et al . 2002 ) .",
    "if so , it would be the largest example of such a feature identified to date .",
    "a detailed comparison with the x - ray observations would be required to investigate this idea .",
    "basic research in astronomy at the naval research laboratory is funded by the office of naval research .",
    "t. e. c. was supported in part by the national aeronautics and space administration through @xmath57 award number go2 - 3160x , issued by the @xmath57 x - ray observatory center , which is operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory for and on behalf of nasa under contract nas8 - 39073 .                                            *",
