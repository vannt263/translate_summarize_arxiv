    "there is current interest in improving the wilson fermion action to remove all @xmath1 discretization errors .",
    "an improved action is already known @xcite , however to measure matrix elements without @xmath1 errors we also need a method of improving the operators .",
    "this is done by adding improvement terms , operators of higher dimension , either with one extra derivative or with an extra power of the quark mass @xmath3 . in this",
    "talk we discuss a non - perturbative method of determining the renormalization factors , @xmath2 , and the improvement coefficients , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for these operators .",
    "the method of finding @xmath2 is that suggested in @xcite , operator expectation values are measured for quark states travelling through landau gauge gluon configurations .",
    "the @xmath2 factors are found from the ratio of the measured expectation values to the tree - level value .",
    "the improvement coefficients can be found from the same sort of data , by using the chiral ward identities of qcd .",
    "our computational methods are discussed in more detail in @xcite . + desy 97 - 180 + hub - ep-97/67",
    "we need a way to identify the @xmath1 effects in three - point functions , so that we can tune the improvement parameters to remove them .",
    "there is a way to do this , since the wilson mass term and the sheikholeslami - wohlert clover term both violate chiral symmetry .",
    "= 6.5 cm    [ fig : fermprop ]    if we were simulating a theory which respected chiral symmetry , it would be easy to use this fact to pick out @xmath1 effects , and we could recognise the correct improvement parameters by the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "however for lattice qcd things are not quite this simple . as well as",
    "the chiral symmetry violation coming from lattice artifacts , which we want to remove , there is also genuine chiral symmetry violation , some coming from the fact that we work with finite quark mass , and some from the well - known fact that qcd spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "we need to know how big the real violation of chiral symmetry is .",
    "fortunately there is a way to identify this genuine component of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "chiral ward identities can be constructed for any green function , which tell us exactly how much violation of chiral symmetry should be present .    the simplest case to consider is the fermion propagator . in theories , such as the naive fermion action , where the only explicit breaking of chiral symmetry is a mass term @xmath6 , the quark propagator satisfies @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the amputated three - point function .",
    "because @xmath9 and @xmath10 anticommute , this identity relates the running mass ( the scalar part of @xmath11 ) to the pseudoscalar density . with naive fermions @xmath12 , so the ward identity eq.([propward ] )",
    "holds in the same form both for bare and renormalized green functions .",
    "if chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken the right hand side does nt vanish as @xmath13 , and the fermion propagator looks massive even in the chiral limit @xcite .    in our action",
    "this chiral ward identity is not automatically true . as well as chiral symmetry breaking from the mass term",
    "there is additional breaking from the wilson and clover terms .",
    "we can now determine improvement coefficients , and find some information about the @xmath2s , if we impose the chiral ward identity , by insisting that the improved green functions obey the identity @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "we are fortunate that improving @xmath16 is easier than improving most operators .",
    "there is no single - derivative operator to add , all we have to do is multiply @xmath16 by a factor of the type @xmath17 .",
    "the improvement of the quark propagator is slightly more complicated .",
    "as well as multiplying by a @xmath3-dependent factor , we also have to subtract a contact term from the propagator  @xcite @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 is a constant in momentum space , or a @xmath21 function in position space .",
    "this makes the chiral symmetry breaking term as short - range as possible . in perturbation",
    "theory we can see that the @xmath1 corrections to the propagator only take this simple form if @xmath0 is correctly chosen  @xcite .    in fig.[fig : fermprop ] we show how well the ward identities can be satisfied when the improvement coefficients are correctly chosen .",
    "the agreement is good while @xmath22 .",
    "there are similar ward identities for the flavour non - singlet three - point functions , but they require the measurement of four - point functions @xmath23 . @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fermion matrix . in naive fermions ward identities analogous to eq.([propward ] ) relate the chiral violation in the three - point functions @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "for example , for the local vector current , @xmath28 the @xmath23s also appear in ward identities for the parity - splitting between the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    [ fig : vector ]    again these identities do not hold automatically for clover fermions , but we can require that they hold for the improved and renormalized @xmath26s and @xmath23s . we should point out that the renormalization of the @xmath23s is not simply multiplicative . because the sum over the sites in eq.([hdef ] ) includes short - distance contributions , coming from regions where the two operator - insertions are close together , additional counter - terms , proportional to three - point functions , arise . these will be discussed in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "the first operator we have tried this method on is the local vector current . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vector ] we compare the amputated green function for the improved local vector current , with the value it should have , according to the ward identity eq.([eq : wardgh ] ) .",
    "as in @xcite amputations are performed by dividing by the improved fermion propagator .",
    "we see that the comparison is very sensitive to the value of the improvement coefficient @xmath31 , defined by @xmath32 when we use a poor value ( as in the upper graph ) the violation of eq.([eq : wardgh ] ) is clear .",
    "our preliminary result is that we find the best agreement with the ward identity when @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "since we are working with off - shell quantities we can not use the equations of motion to eliminate either @xmath5 or @xmath31 .",
    "we can test these coefficients , derived from off - shell quarks , by using them to renormalize our on - shell nucleon measurements .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the known value of the conserved vector current @xcite .",
    "so we see that using chiral ward identities to tell us when @xmath1 effects have been removed seems a promising method .",
