    "rna polymerase ( rnap ) is a molecular motor @xcite .",
    "it moves on a stretch of dna , utilizing chemical energy input , while polymerizing a messenger rna ( mrna ) @xcite .",
    "the sequence of monomeric subunits of the mrna is dictated by the corresponding sequence on the template dna .",
    "this process of template - dictated polymerization of rna is usually referred to as _ transcription _",
    "it comprises three stages , namely , initiation , elongation of the mrna and termination .",
    "we first report analytical results on the characteristic properties of single rnap motors . in our approach @xcite , each rnap is represented by a hard rod while the dna track is modelled as a one - dimensional lattice whose sites represent a nucleotide , the monomeric subunits of the dna .",
    "the mechano - chemistry of individual rnap motors is captured in this model by assigning @xmath0 distinct `` chemical '' states to each rnap and postulating the nature of the transitions between these states .",
    "the dwell time of an rnap at successive monomers of the dna template is a random variable ; its distribution characterizes the stochastic nature of the movement of rnap motors .",
    "we derive the _ exact _ analytical expression for the dwell - time distribution of the rnaps in this model .",
    "we also report results on the collective movements of the rnaps .",
    "often many rnaps move simultaneously on the same dna track ; because of superficial similarities with vehicular traffic @xcite , we refer to such collective movements of rnaps as rnap traffic @xcite .",
    "our model of rnap traffic can be regarded as an extension of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite for hard rods where each rod can exist at a location in one of its @xmath0 possible chemical states .",
    "the movement of an rnap on its dna track is coupled to the elongation of the mrna chain that it synthesizes .",
    "naturally , the rate of its forward movement depends on the availability of the monomeric subunits of the mrna and the associated `` chemical '' transitions on the dominant pathway in its mechano - chemical cycle . because of the incorporation of the mechano - chemical cycles of individual rnap motors , the number of rate constants in this model is higher than that in a tasep for hard rods .",
    "consequently , we plot the phase diagrams of our model not in a two - dimensionl plane ( as is customary for the tasep ) , but in a 3-dimensional space where the additional dimension corresponds to the concentration of the monomeric subunits of the mrna .",
    "we take the dna template as a one dimensional lattice of length @xmath1 and each rnap is taken as a hard rod of length @xmath2 in units of the length of a nucleotide .",
    "although an rnap covers @xmath2 nucleotides , its position is denoted by the _",
    "nucleotide covered by it .",
    "transcription initiation and termination steps are taken into account by the rate constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . a hard rod , representing an mrna , attaches to the first site @xmath5 on the lattice with rate @xmath3 if the first @xmath6 sites are not covered by any other rnap at that instant of time .",
    "similarly , an mrna bound to the rightmost site @xmath7 is released from the system , with rate @xmath4 .",
    "we have assumed hard core steric interaction among the rnaps ; therefore , no site can be simultaneously covered by more than one rnap . at every lattice site @xmath8",
    ", an rnap can exist in one of two possible chemical states : in one of these it is bound with a pyrophosphate ( which is one of the byproducts of rna elongation reaction and is denoted by the symbol @xmath9 ) , whereas no @xmath9 is bound to it in the other chemical state ( see fig.[fig - model ] ) . for plotting our results ,",
    "we have used throughout this paper @xmath10,@xmath11 and @xmath12~\\tilde{\\omega}_{21}^f ~s^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath13 $ ] is concentration of nucleotide triphosphate monomers ( fuel for transcription elongation ) and @xmath14 .",
    "for every rnap , the dwell time is measured by an imaginary `` stop watch '' which is reset to zero whenever the rnap reaches the chemical state @xmath15 , _ for the first time _ , after arriving at a new site ( say , @xmath16-th from the @xmath8-th ) .",
    "let @xmath17 be the probability of finding a rnap in the chemical state @xmath18 at time @xmath19 .",
    "the time evolution of the probabilities @xmath17 are given by @xmath20 @xmath21 there is a close formal similarity between the mechano - chemical cycle of an rnap in our model ( see fig.[fig - model ] ) and the catalytic cycle of an enzyme in the michaelis - menten scenario @xcite .",
    "the states @xmath15 and @xmath22 in the former correspond to the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the latter where @xmath23 represents the free enzyme while @xmath24 represents the enzyme - substrate complex . following the steps of calculation used earlier by kuo et al .",

    "depending on the magnitudes of the rate constants the peak of the distribution may appear at such a small @xmath19 that it may not possible to detect the existence of this maxium in a laboratory experiment .",
    "in that case , the dwell time distribution would appear to be purely a single exponential @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that our model does not incorporate backtracking of rnap motors which have been observed in the _ in - vitro _",
    "experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been argued by some groups @xcite that short transcriptional pausing is distinct from the long pauses which arise from backtracking .",
    "in contrast , some other groups @xcite claim that polymerase backtracking can account for both the short and long pauses .",
    "thus , the the role of backtracking in the pause distribution remain controversial .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that a polymerase stalled by backtracking can be re - activated by the `` push '' of another closely following it from behind @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the crowded molecular environment of intracellular space , the occurrence of backtracking may be far less frequent that those observed under _ in - vitro _ conditions .",
    "our model , which does not allow backtracking , predicts a dwell time distribution which is qualitatively very similar to that of the short pauses provided the most probable dwell time is shorter than 1 s.    from equation ( [ eq - ftgen ] ) we get the inverse mean dwell time @xmath29 } } \\label{eq - avtgen}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the form of the expression ( [ eq - avtgen ] ) is identical to the michaelis - menten formula for the average rate of an enzymatic reaction .",
    "it describes the slowing down of the `` bare '' elongation progress of an rnap due to the ntp reaction cycle that it has to undergo .",
    "the unit of velocity is @xmath32 .",
    "the fluctuations of the dwell time can be computed from the second moment @xmath33 } { \\left(\\omega_{12}~\\omega_{21}^f   \\right)^2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of the dwell time distribution .",
    "we find the randomness parameter @xcite @xmath34     is plotted against ntp concentration for three values of the parameter @xmath28 .",

    ", @xmath37 is unity because ntp binding with the rnap is the rate - limiting step . as ntp concentration increases",
    ", @xmath37 exhibits a nonmonotonic variation . at sufficiently high ntp concentration , pp@xmath38-release ( which occurs with the rate @xmath28 ) is the rate - limiting step and ,",
    "therefore , @xmath37 is unity also in this limit .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the fact that the smaller is the magnitude of @xmath28 , the quicker is the crossover to the value @xmath36 as the ntp concentration is increased .",
