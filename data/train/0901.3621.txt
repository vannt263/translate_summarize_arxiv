    "the difficulty in establishing a sensible global solution to the problem of low @xmath0 ( reynolds number ) viscous flow around simple objects , where the flow is uniform at infinity , has fascinated applied mathematicians for just over 150 years .",
    "stokes ( 1851 ) established that there was no solution to the two - dimensional , steady , incompressible , equations for asymptotically uniform flow around a cylinder in the biharmonic limit .",
    "this situation is now routinely described in modern tutorial discussions .",
    "see , for example , chapter 7 of acheson ( 1990 ) for an exercise on stokes paradox and a discussion of the corresponding situation for the sphere . the biharmonic equation can be solved in a neighbourhood of the cylinder ( i.e. a circle ) by any stream function of the form @xmath1 but there is no choice of @xmath2 for which @xmath3 for large @xmath4 .",
    "the analysis of this problem has lead to several classic papers ( oseen , 1910 ; lamb , 1911 ) and its understanding through the use of matched asymptotic expansions ( mae ) is one of the triumphs of perturbation theory .",
    "the reader is referred to van dyke ( 1964 ) for his classic survey of the work of kaplun ( 1957 ) , proudman and pearson ( 1957 ) and other key references .    however , the mae approach , despite its immense power and diversity of expanding applications , does not give a clean resolution of the original difficulty in that such methods rely essentially on computing and then matching solutions to the problem defined on two regions : close to the cylinder and far from the cylinder .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the problem of finding _ global _",
    "solutions for the low reynolds number limit , i.e. to resolve the original paradox .",
    "there are , of course , other approaches to the paradox .",
    "recently , villas boas @xcite has considered the problem from a three - dimensional perspective and points out that there is then no paradox .",
    "a large class of fluids can be characterized by their density , @xmath5 , a scalar field not presumed to be constant , and their dynamic viscosity @xmath6 .",
    "the flow is characterized by a velocity vector field @xmath7 , and an associated scalar pressure field @xmath8 .",
    "conservation of mass is expressed by the continuity equation @xmath9 and the conservation of momentum is expressed by the navier - stokes equations acting on _ vectors _ should be understood as the ordinary laplacian acting on cartesian components . ]",
    "@xmath10 if the fluid is incompressible in the sense that @xmath5 is a constant in both time and space , we have the condition : @xmath11 to analyze matters further , we introduce the vorticity vector @xmath12 in the following discussion we demand incompressibility but allow for non - zero vorticity . using simple identities from vector calculus the navier - stokes equations",
    "may then be recast in the form @xmath13 taking the curl of this , we arrive at the vorticity equation @xmath14 where the kinematic viscosity @xmath15 .",
    "since the velocity field is divergence - free , we may introduce a vector potential @xmath16 such that @xmath17 and furthermore we may choose it so that it is divergence free : @xmath18 the vector potential can be reduced to a single function when there is an appropriate symmetry .",
    "the resulting object is a stream function .",
    "for example , planar 2d flow is obtained by setting ( and note that this automatically satisfies satisfies the divergence condition ) @xmath19 next we note that under the assumption that @xmath20 satisfies @xmath21 @xmath22 and the vorticity equation becomes    @xmath23    for problems where it is possible to identify a natural length scale @xmath24 and a natural speed @xmath25 , it is normal practice to perform a non - dimensionalization of the variables and introduce the reynolds number @xmath26 . then the navierstokes equation becomes ( after rescaling the variables suitably to @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 throughout this paper we shall work in units in which the _ radius _ @xmath29 of the cylinder is taken to be unity . in such units the reynolds number is here based on the radius on the diameter . ] and is given by @xmath30 .",
    "the two stream functions are related by @xmath31 and furthermore @xmath32 etc .",
    "the old historical approach to the limiting case when @xmath33 and the flow is time - independent is to take the view that the non - linearities may then be ignored ( provided the non - linear term is well behaved ) and the time - independent navierstokes equations reduce to @xmath34 which is the biharmonic limit , also known as stokes flow .",
    "it is now well known ( see for example , chapter 8 of van dyke ( 1964 ) ) that the neglect of the non - linear terms can lead to inconsistencies , as is evidenced by the lack of any solution for asymptotically uniform two - dimensional flow past a cylinder .",
    "here we introduce the scalar vorticity function @xmath35 and write the navierstokes as the pair @xmath36 if we had exponential growth in vorticity , @xmath37 , then the linearized form would be @xmath38 or in terms of a single condition : @xmath39 which is the laplace - helmholtz equation .",
    "let us focus temporarily on the linearized time - dependent case based on the laplace - helmholtz equation .",
    "we let @xmath40 .",
    "it is an elementary exercise ( and we shall give equivalent details in a different context later ) to establish that for all @xmath41 , the laplace - helmholtz equation @xmath42 has a solution of the form @xmath43 \\sin ( \\theta ) \\label{tdsf}\\ ] ] that satisfies @xmath44 in other words , no matter how small the value of @xmath6 , the paradox does not exist .    to summarize :",
    "if we have some time - dependence in the simplified form of exponential growth in vorticity the linearization is precisely the laplace - helmholtz problem rather than the biharmonic problem .",
    "addition of this type of extra variability , no matter how small , shows that the paradox evaporates , i.e. the existence of the paradox is unstable .",
    "villas boas @xcite , who has considered the problem from a three - dimensional perspective , also demonstrates that the paradox evaporates when extra _ spatial _ variability is incorporated .    in subsequent analysis",
    "we will use the laplace - helmholtz model as a approximation for the time-_independent _ 2d case , but where the modification is regarded as a simple way as approximating the combined effect of the non - linearities via a linear term .",
    "the question is as to whether we can do this in a sensible and self - consistent manner .",
    "we shall look at this in a variety of ways , starting with a rather _ ad hoc _ approach .",
    "the production of a global solution to the equations requires a slightly unusual approach .",
    "we take the time - independent equation @xmath45 as our starting point and note some obvious facts .",
    "first , if we have a @xmath46 satisfying laplace s equation , then it satisfies equation eq .",
    "( [ oldfour ] ) identically .",
    "second , in the high reynolds number limit , although this is a singular limit , we note that the jacobian term should then vanish identically , so that any solution of @xmath47 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ oldfour ] ) when @xmath48 .",
    "this will be true of course in the linear case when @xmath49 and this last equation is of helmholtz type .",
    "now let @xmath50 be a ( possibly complex ) number of order 1 and @xmath51 a parameter to be determined .",
    "in particular , if we consider solutions , @xmath52 , of a parametrized helmholtz equation in the form @xmath53 then the jacobian will vanish and we note that @xmath54 next suppose that we consider a more general stream function @xmath55 as @xmath56 then a trivial calculation tells us that @xmath57 our approach is therefore to combine solutions for potential flow , @xmath46 , with a solution @xmath52 of the helmholtz equation eq .",
    "( 23 ) that also satisfies the fourth order equation given by eq .",
    "( 24 ) without the identically zero non - linear term : @xmath58 when @xmath33 this pde of course approaches the biharmonic equation provided @xmath59 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ expandedns ] ) offers the possibility that we can solve a pde of the form : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be calculated and analyzed .",
    "the introduction of the term of order @xmath63 in the right side of eq .",
    "( [ expandedns ] ) may seem like an artificial device , but given that ( a ) we are seeking solutions of the problem as @xmath33 ; ( b ) we are not modifying higher derivatives in the equations ; ( c ) we have a valid perturbation equation in eq .",
    "( 28 ) , we consider that it is valid to proceed with this approach .",
    "the author recognizes that the argument in the previous sub - section is somewhat _ ad hoc _ , and initially gives us no idea how to justify the choice of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , or , as we shall introduce , the relevant composite parameter @xmath64 .",
    "however , there is another other route to justifying this approach .",
    "let @xmath35 .",
    "then the full 2d time - independent incompressible navier  stokes equation is precisely @xmath65 we already know from the existence of the stokes paradox that simple linearization by setting @xmath66 is hopeless .",
    "we might therefore consider starting from other linearizations , for example , the helmholtz linearization @xmath67 where @xmath64 has to be determined either from experiment or from deeper theoretical considerations .",
    "the linear starting point for analysis is then not the biharmonic system but the helmholtz - laplace equation : @xmath68 in principle then we can consider justifying the choice of @xmath64 by matching @xmath69 with @xmath70 as closely as possible under a suitable norm .",
    "we will prove in the next section that _ for all @xmath71 the helmholtz - laplace equation admits a solution satisfying both the boundary conditions on the circle and the velocity condition at infinity _ , obtained by considering elementary solutions that are linear combinations of solutions of the laplace equation and solutions of the helmholtz equation .",
    "note that this approach and our _ ad hoc _ scheme are linked by the relationship @xmath72 the determination of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are interesting challenges .",
    "we shall see in section 8 that there are good theoretical grounds for setting @xmath73 .",
    "for now we will leave both parameters general .",
    "we now consider the well - trodden route to the analysis of a stream function associated with a flow that is uniform at infinity and satisfies appropriate boundary conditions on @xmath74 . using polar coordinates , we therefore want @xmath75 and @xmath76 we build the solution for @xmath46 and @xmath52 as follows , under the assumption that @xmath46 satisfies the laplace equation and @xmath52 the helmholtz conditions .",
    "any sum of the two will satisfy the laplace - helmholtz equation . given that the angular behaviour at infinity is @xmath77",
    "we make the standard assumption and seek solutions @xmath78 the potential flow part ( as usual ) will be taken to be @xmath79 for some constant @xmath80 .",
    "our analysis will differ from stokes classic ( stokes , 1851 ) treatment in that @xmath81 does not satisfy the separated biharmonic equation .",
    "instead we use the helmholtz equation , which in separated form is just @xmath82 where @xmath83 . the general solution to this ode",
    "is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 are standard `` modified '' bessel functions .",
    "it is now quite clear that we can construct @xmath81 so as the preserve the boundary condition at infinity by setting @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath87 function decays exponentially if @xmath71 .",
    "we are left with two arbitrary constants that can be determined by satisfying the boundary conditions on the circle given by eq .",
    "( [ circlebc ] ) .",
    "this is a matter of elementary algebra using some standard bessel function identities .",
    "the final result for the total stream function can be simplified to : @xmath88 \\sin ( \\theta ) \\label{streamfn}\\ ] ] we note some interesting facts about this expression .",
    "first , it has the _ right _ behaviour as @xmath89 provided @xmath90 , as the bessel function of @xmath4 decays exponentially .",
    "second , if we keep @xmath4 fixed and finite and let @xmath91 we obtain @xmath92 and we recover a multiple of stokes ( 1851 ) solution satisfying the boundary conditions on the sphere ( but not at infinity ) , and , furthermore , the multiple is now reminiscent of that arising from the methods of matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "the claim therefore is that it is eq .",
    "( [ streamfn ] ) that essentially resolves the paradox , as all the boundary conditions are satisfied , but the low reynolds number limit for finite @xmath4 does not .",
    "the third observation is that in the neighbourhood of the surface of the sphere , @xmath93 and that for small @xmath64 this is given by @xmath94 we also note that the limit as @xmath95 is just the potential flow limit : @xmath96 _ mathematica _ code for the evaluation of the stream function and velocity field is given in the appendix .      at this stage",
    "we have no knowledge about how to fix the parameter @xmath97 , and we now turn our attention to this issue and a more detailed analysis of eq .",
    "( [ expandedns ] ) .",
    "we note first that our working assumption of a power dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath0 has not actually been necessary .",
    "all we need is that @xmath91 as @xmath33 .",
    "we also note that the choice @xmath73 and @xmath98 recovers the result ( van dyke , 1964 ) that the limiting stream function for fixed @xmath4 and small @xmath0 is , from eq .",
    "( [ nearcyl ] ) @xmath99 so that the low @xmath0 limit matches exactly the first term of the mae result . on the diameter we have @xmath100 etc . in the denominator . ] clearly other choices of @xmath50 can be considered , as can other powers of @xmath0 or even a more general @xmath64 still . however , in section 8 we will establish a theoretical basis for estimating these parameters , and argue that @xmath73 .",
    "we must now analyze the right side of eq .",
    "( [ expandedns])we call it @xmath101and we do so without any assumption as the the form of @xmath64 .",
    "we have , changing variables in the jacobian to polar coordinates : @xmath102\\ ] ] recall that we set @xmath103 .",
    "having imposed the boundary conditions , we have @xmath104 it follows that @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the reduced jacobian : @xmath107 and @xmath108 denotes the ` helmholtz artifact ' introduced by our approach , and @xmath109 denotes the non - linear jacobian term . some calculation with bessel function identities leads to @xmath110 from which it is manifest that @xmath111 and the non - linear terms vanish on the cylinder boundary irrespective of the choice of @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic behaviour of the bessel functions tells us that provided @xmath71 , @xmath112 as @xmath89 .",
    "we deduce that @xmath109 is a bounded function for all @xmath4 .",
    "what is its order as a function of @xmath0 ?",
    "a straightforward estimate may be given by looking in a neighbourhood of the cylinder .",
    "it is straightforward to establish that @xmath113 where the latter expression applies as @xmath114 .",
    "we deduce that in the _ immediate _ neighbourhood of the cylinder @xmath115 which is @xmath116 provided only that @xmath114 as @xmath33 .",
    "although @xmath106 grows to a maximum as @xmath4 is increased away from unity , before reaching a maximum and then decaying for large @xmath4 , some numerical experiments with _ mathematica _ confirm that the maximum of @xmath117 slowly decreases as @xmath64 decreases to zero .",
    "so we can assert that @xmath109 is well behaved and is @xmath116 .",
    "when we consider @xmath118 , it is easy to see that @xmath81 has a maximum on @xmath74 , and that @xmath119 as @xmath114 .",
    "so this term also behaves .",
    "if we desire that the helmholtz artifact tends to zero faster than the non - linear term ( which is desirable for the credibility of our approach ) it is then natural to specify @xmath64 in the form @xmath120 and to demand that @xmath121 . in particular , the choice @xmath73 arranges that @xmath122 and we have established that @xmath123 .",
    "it also decays exponentially at infinity .",
    "the calculation of the drag can be done by integrating the pointwise force on the cylinder over its surface .",
    "the pointwise force has two components .",
    "one involves the local rate of strain in the fluid , and the other is the pressure force .",
    "the first requires a purely local calculation , but the second requires an integration of the pressure equation from infinity to the cylinder .",
    "a question is how this second part can be carried out _ without _ any _ global _ representation of the flow field .",
    "for the _ specific _ case of low reynolds number calculations with a certain symmetry there are ways around the problem that we shall exploit presently . to make these matters clear ,",
    "we shall summarize a first - principles calculation of the force using the results for cylindrical polar coordinates for the rate of strain as given by appendix a of acheson ( 1990 ) .",
    "the fluid velocity is given ( in our units ) by @xmath124 on the cylinder the rate - of - strain tensor has components @xmath125 , and @xmath126 the stress tensor @xmath127 , so the force on the cylinder boundary is @xmath128 we project this into the @xmath129-direction and integrate over the circle to get the following formula for the drag @xmath130 ( force per unit length on the cylinder ) : @xmath131d\\theta\\ ] ] for low @xmath0 we estimate the pressure using the momentum equation in the form @xmath132 and a short calculation gives @xmath133 we need to integrate this in from infinity to a general point on the circle @xmath74 .",
    "in general this is awkward without a global form of @xmath55 .",
    "but if @xmath55 has the form @xmath134 then we have @xmath135\\   \\ { \\rm where}\\ \\",

    "( 1 ) and then @xmath145 and @xmath146 are given by @xmath147 in our new model @xmath145 as is given by the radial part of eq .",
    "( [ streamfn ] ) , and this time , using some bessel identities , we obtain @xmath148        we recall now the original assumption that @xmath83 . if we fix @xmath149 but allow @xmath50 to vary the drag coefficient of our model is then @xmath150 we can plot the drag coefficient from our model , assuming that @xmath149 , with various choices for @xmath50 , and compare the results with those of tritton ( 1959 ) , which used an @xmath0 based on the diameter .",
    "tritton s data has been converted by halving _",
    "his _ reynolds number .",
    "also , in making a comparison with fig .",
    "8.5 of van dyke ( 1964 ) , it appears that van dyke has plotted @xmath151 , as otherwise it is not possible to reconcile that plot with tritton s data . in figure 1",
    "we show the data for the first three fibres used by tritton ( those that consider the lowest @xmath0 ) and    * our model with @xmath50 picked to match the mae result , @xmath152 ; * our model with a least squares best fit @xmath153 ; * the one term mae result based on @xmath154 ; * the two term mae result based on @xmath155 .",
    "the choice of constants in the mae approach is itself somewhat arbitrary .",
    "that made by kaplun ( 1957 ) , giving eq .",
    "( [ nearcyl ] ) , is little more than convenience .",
    "these results give support to the new model and the agreement with experiment we get by taking @xmath50 about one half that implied by the mae approach is rather tantalizing .",
    "another use for the type of low reynolds numbers solution developed here is to provide a basis for _ iteration _ of the solution in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of the paradox obstructing a global representation in the standard approach makes this impossible .",
    "furthermore , we know from a corresponding analysis of the 3d spherical problem that even when the base solution makes sense , even the first iteration may fail : the _ stokes - whitehead _ paradox emerges .",
    "so it is of considerable interest to investigate the iteration of the system . in doing",
    "so we will keep @xmath64 general initially .",
    "we summarize the solution developed thus far . with @xmath55",
    "as given we have , combining equations ( [ expandedns],45 ) and our definitions , @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 where these equations also serve to define the radial terms @xmath159 . from now on we will work in terms of these radial functions , so it is useful just to write down their explicit forms : @xmath160 @xmath161      we now attempt to refine the solution by writing the total solution as @xmath162 ideally we would like to arrange that @xmath163 the right side of this is given by the expansion @xmath164 and we write the remaining parts of the navier - stokes equation as @xmath165 we do not know how to solve this full non - linear system , and propose instead to treat a linearized form .",
    "the question now is whether to work with the raw system @xmath166 or to propose a helmholtz - damped variation along the lines of our original approach .",
    "we also need to understand which non - linear term to treat first . _",
    "@xmath64 is of the form @xmath167 , for example , we know that @xmath109 is the lowest order in @xmath0 : @xmath168 , so we will give priority to killing this lowest order correction .",
    "to develop the solution we need to identify the greens s function for the biharmonic operator .",
    "in fact we do not need the full form as the angular structure of the right side is simple - we need only look for a pair of appropriate radial green s functions satisfying appropriate boundary conditions on the cylinder and at infinity . to this end",
    "we write @xmath169 and require that @xmath170 and @xmath171 we also require that @xmath172 vanishes as @xmath89 and both @xmath172 and its first derivative vanish on @xmath74 . to proceed further we recall the elementary form of the laplacian in 2d cylindrical polar coordinates : @xmath173 so if @xmath62 is of the form @xmath174 then @xmath175 define the @xmath61the radial modal laplacian operator as @xmath176 we now have a pair of odes in the form @xmath177 @xmath178 in a simpler problem we would now construct a pair of green s functions @xmath179 , @xmath180 , with the properties that @xmath181 subject to , _ if it is possible _ , @xmath182 @xmath183 @xmath184 however , there are significant complications .",
    "the helmholtz term we have thought of as an modelling artifact has first to be understood as an optimal linear approximation to the full non - linear system .",
    "the first steps on this are considered in section 8 .",
    "we will eventually have to manage the fact that no @xmath185 function exists satisfying these boundary conditions .",
    "however , it is now consistent to proceed to construct @xmath186 , as this ( a ) exists , and ( b ) is needed for the management of the full non - linear system and its solution .",
    "we will now focus on the lowest order correction arising from the inertia term , for which @xmath186 is the required radial green s function .",
    "the building blocks for this are two different solutions of the ode @xmath187 the solution to the homogeneous problem is of the form @xmath188 to try to build a green s function , we would write down a pair of solutions : @xmath189 the condition at infinity requires that we set @xmath190 , so that @xmath191 the boundary conditions on the cylinder require that @xmath192 so the inner function is given by @xmath193 we now have four unknowns that must be obtained by imposing junction conditions to obtain the delta - function .",

    "further we need to better understand the full non - linear system .",
    "the task now at hand is to develop a proper theoretical basis for the estimation of the parameter @xmath64 . to this end",

    "the `` perturbation '' to the linearized equations introduced to accomplish this is of higher order in @xmath0 than the inertia terms , and this modification is now properly understood as a linear representation of the full non - linear theory .",

    "the need to properly treat the non - linearities has also been illustrated by the observation that the presence of a paradox is unstable with respect to small changes in the system .",
