    "the first idea to explain the energy loss of radio pulsars was to consider the magneto - dipole radiation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the magneto - dipole formula gives for the radiation power @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the angle between rotational and magnetic axis , @xmath2 is a neutron star radius @xmath3 km , and @xmath4 is a pulsar angular velocity .",
    "this formula explains pulsar activity and observed energy loss for expected large magnetic field near the surface @xmath5",
    "gs .    let us recall that the physical reason of such energy loss is the action of the torque exerted on the pulsar by the ampere force of the electric currens flowing over the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields in the outgoing magneto - dipole wave in vacuum can be found by solving the wave equations @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the boundary conditions stated as the fields corresponding components @xmath8 and @xmath9 being continuous through the neutron star surface . inside the star one can consider magnetic field as homogeneous , and find the corresponding electric field using the frozen - in condition . as a result , the full solution will give us the discontinuity of @xmath10 and @xmath11 attributed to the surface charge @xmath12 and the surface current @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the ampere force exerts the torque @xmath14ds}\\ ] ] on the neutron star .",
    "the energy loss of a pulsar due to this torque is equal to ( [ md-0 ] ) .",
    "thus , it is the surface current that is responsible for the angular momentum transform from a neutron star to an outgoing magneto - dipole wave  @xcite .",
    "a pulsar in vacuum loses its rotational energy due to angular momentum transform to the electromagnetic wave at the rate given by ( [ md-0 ] ) .",
    "however , this is not so if the pulsar magnetosphere is filled with plasma and there is no longitudinal current in the magnetosphere .",
    "as was shown by @xcite and @xcite , in this case the poynting flux through the light cylinder is equal to zero . indeed , as the ideal conductivity condition is applicable not only inside the neutron star but outside as well there is no magnetic field discontinuity at the star surface .",
    "consequently , there is no ampere force acting on a pulsar and , hence , there is no energy loss . for zero longitudinal current",
    "the light cylinder is a natural boundary of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "in this section we remind the exact solution for the surface current within the polar cap presented in the monograph by @xcite . as it was shown in the previous section ,",
    "the neutron star retardation is due to ampere force @xmath15 .",
    "if the magnetosphere is filled with plasma , the surface current @xmath16 is flowing within magnetic polar cap only .",
    "this surface current closes the volume longitudinal current in the magnetosphere and the return current flowing along the separatrix between open and closed field lines region .    in order to write the equation for the surface current",
    ", the several assumptions must be made .",
    "we assume that the conductivity of the pulsar surface is uniform , and the electric field @xmath17 has a potential , so that the surface current can be written as @xmath18 . using the stationary continuity equation @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is equal to the volume current @xmath21 flowing along the open field lines ,",
    "one can obtain @xmath22    making the substitution @xmath23 and introducing the non - dimensional potential @xmath24 and current @xmath25 we get @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are polar and azimuth angles with respect to magnetic axis .",
    "equation ( [ 7 ] ) needs a boundary condition .",
    "this boundary condition results from the proposition that there is no surface current outside the magnetic polar cap .",
    "this means that @xmath29 = { \\rm const } , \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the polar cap boundary .",
    "the solution for the dirichlet problem ( [ 7 ] , [ a1 ] ) can be obtained by the fourier method .",
    "the jump in the potential derivative at @xmath31 gives us the current flowing along the separatrix .",
    "as we see , it is defined uniquely by the longitudinal current in the region of open field lines and by condition that no longitudinal current can flow in the region of the closed field lines .    for arbitrary inclination angle @xmath1 the current @xmath32 can be written as a sum of its symmetric @xmath33 and anti - symmetric @xmath34 components .",
    "the anti - symmetric current begins playing the main role when the pulsar polar cap crosses the surface where the goldreich - julian charge density @xmath35 changes sign .",
    "this condition can be written as @xmath36 for example , taking the goldreich - julian current density @xmath37 we obtain the following solutions of the dirichlet problem ( [ 7])-([a1 ] ) for the symmetric and anti - symmetric volume currents respectively : @xmath38 @xmath39    the torque exerted by the surface current over the neuron star can be written as @xmath40\\right]{\\rm d}s , \\label{9}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the dipole field near the neutron star surface .",
    "let us decompose the braking torque @xmath42 over the orthogonal system of unit vectors @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath43 is a unit vector along the magnetic moment ; vector @xmath44 is perpendicular to the magnetic moment and lies in the plane of the magnetic moment and the rotational axis ; vector @xmath45 complements these to the right - hand triple : @xmath46 @xmath47 plays no role in euler equations that describe the rotational dynamics of the decelerating neutron star . as a result",
    "we have  @xcite : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "the leading perpendicular torque component @xmath52 is equal to zero equivalently for arbitrary shape of the polar cap due to the boundary condition ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be written as @xmath55 , \\label{16 } \\\\",

    "\\label{17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 depending on the shape of the polar cap are much less than unity , and the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we can now find the derivatives of the angular velocity @xmath60 and of the inclination angle @xmath61 of a neutron star through the euler dynamics equations : @xmath62 for the inclination angles @xmath1 not too close to @xmath63 ( i.e. , for @xmath64 ) , when the anti - symmetric current plays no role in the neutron star dynamics , we obtain @xmath65    as a result , for homogeneous current density within open magnetic field lines region @xmath66 const where @xmath67 we have @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the non - dimensional area of a pulsar polar cap : @xmath70 .",
    "it depends on the structure of the magnetic field near the light cylinder . for a pure dipole magnetic field ( and aligned rotator ) @xmath71 , and for a magnetosphere containing no longitudinal currents @xmath72 changes from @xmath73 for the aligned rotator , @xmath74 @xcite , to @xmath75 for an orthogonal rotator , @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "recent numerical calculations for an axisymmetric magnetosphere with non - zero longitudinal electric current give @xmath77 ",
    "@xmath78  @xcite .",
    "if the singular point separating open and close field lines can be located inside the light cylinder , the value @xmath72 can be even @xmath79 .",
    "as the goldreich - julian charge density near the polar cap is propotrional to @xmath80 , one can write @xmath81    on the other hand for @xmath82 when the anti - symmetric current plays the leading role we obtain @xmath83 as we see , the energy loss of the orthogonal rotator are @xmath84 times smaller than of the aligned rotator .",
    "the recent discovery of the `` part - time job '' pulsars psr b1931 + 24 @xcite with @xmath85 shows that the current loss is indeed playing an important role in the pulsar energy loss .",
    "if we assume that in the on - state the energy loss is connected with the current loss only and in the off - state with the magneto - dipole radiation ( in which case the magnetosphere must be not filled with plasma ) we get @xmath86 it gives @xmath87 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume the spitkovsky s relation for the on - state energy loss @xcite @xmath88 we obtain @xmath89 clear , this ratio can not be equal to 1.5 for any inclination angle .",
    "this discrepancy can be connected with that fact that all the numerical calculations produced recently contain no restriction on the longitudinal electric current magnitude . as a result",
    ", current density can be much larger than goldreich - julian one .",
    "as we have shown , the current loss plays the major role in the pulsar dynamics . in particular ,",
    "the behaviour of the pulsar b1931 + 24 can be naturally explained within this model .",
    "the current loss model have some important consequences :    1 .",
    "the energy loss of an orthogonal rotator is @xmath90 times smaller than for an aligned rotator .",
    "this is connected with the boundary condition ( [ a1 ] ) that leads to almost full screening of the toroidal magnetic field in the open field lines region ( see @xcite ) ; 2 .   consequently , during its evolution a pulsar inclination angle tends to @xmath91 where energy loss is minimal .",
    "on the other hand , it is known for the michel s monopole solution that in order to have the mhd flow up to infinity , the toroidal magnetic field must be of the same order as the poloidal electric field on the light cylinder .",
    "if the longitudinal current @xmath92 does not exceed by @xmath93 times the respective goldreich - julian current density ( for the typical pulsars this factor approach the value of @xmath94 ) , the light surface @xmath95 for the orthogonal rotator must be located in the vicinity of the light cylinder . in this case",
    "the effective energy conversion and the current closure is to take place in the boundary layer near the light surface @xcite .    in order for these results being not true",
    "( for example , in order for the light surface being removed to infinity ) there must be a sufficient change in the current density value in the inner gap .",
    "we should emphasize that for the model with free particle escape it is hard to support the current different than the goldriech - julian current . indeed , since @xmath96 is the particle density needed to screen the longitudinal electric field , the value for the current must be close @xmath97 . in order to change this value significantly we must support the plasma inflow in the inner gap region @xcite .",
    "for example , these particles can be produced in the outer gap .",
    "but for different poloidal field configuration it is obvious that the major number of field lines intersect the outer gap region outside the alfvenic surface : as it was shown for several field configurations by @xcite and @xcite , inside the fast magnetosonic surface the flow remains still highly magnetized .",
    "thus , the deviation of current lines from the field lines is negligible . on the other hand , magnetized plasma can intersect the alfvenic surface outwards only ( see @xcite for more detail ) .",
    "thus , the outer gap can not significantly affect the current in the vicinity of the polar cap .    finally , it is necessary to stress that the recent numerical calculations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite do not include into consideration the condition that the longitudinal current density must be close to @xmath98 . in all these works",
    "the authors assume that there may be any current flowing through the cascade region .",
    "however , if this is not so , and the current is indeed close to the goldreich - julian current , the structure of a magnetosphere may be different from the one obtained in the numerical simulations .",
    "as we have seen , the current loss connected with the longitudinal current flowing in the magnetosphere plays the main role in pulsar dynamics , and recent observations of `` part - time job '' pulsar supports this point .",
    "this evolution includes not only a neutron star retardation but also the sufficient change in the angle between magnetic and spin axis .",
    "we have seen as well that the model of current loss depends crucially on the distribution of the electric current and its value in the inner gap . for current loss model with @xmath98",
    "the inclination angle grows with time so a pulsar tends to be an orthogonal rotator . in this case",
    "the energy loss is to be @xmath90 times smaller than for the aligned rotator . as a consequence",
    ", the light surface must be located in the very vicinity of the light cylinder . on the other hand , to realize the homogeneous mhd outflow up to infinity for the orthogonal rotator the current density in the open field line region is to be much larger than @xmath98 ."
