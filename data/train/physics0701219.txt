    "existence of small - scale intermittency is an intriguing yet unsettled topic in contemporary turbulence research . over a number of decades",
    ", researchers had been trying to unravel intermittency in turbulence measurements and at the same time formulating diverse conceptual models to rationalize the observed intermittency.@xcite encouragingly , ` practical ' implications of intermittency research outcomes are also being appreciated by the numerical turbulence modeling community and a critical knowledge transfer is taking place as evidenced by the recent literature.@xcite    one of the most widely used statistics characterizing the intermittent nature of turbulence is the so - called ` intermittency exponent ' ( @xmath0).@xcite from observational data , @xmath0 can be estimated directly or indirectly via several methods .",
    "the direct estimates typically involve appropriate characterization of the second - order scaling behavior of the local rate of energy dissipation ( @xmath1 ) field . in this respect ,",
    "several alternatives ( e.g. , second - order integral moment , two - point correlation function , spectral density ) are available in the literature.@xcite recently , cleve et al.@xcite showed that among various direct approaches , the two - point correlation function @xmath2 of the energy dissipation field provides the most reliable estimates of @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", one can write @xmath3 where @xmath4 is within the inertial range . here ,",
    "the angular brackets denote spatial averaging .",
    "the direct intermittency exponent estimation methods ( based on @xmath1 ) require very high - resolution ( resolving on the order of kolmogorov scale ) data series of pristine quality .",
    "most commonly , fast - response hot wire measurements are used for this purpose.@xcite however , acquisition of hot wire data in a natural setting could be quite challenging .",
    "for example , in the case of atmospheric boundary layer ( abl ) field experiments , one needs to perform meticulous hot wire calibration at short regular intervals in order to account for the ever changing ( diurnally varying ) abl flow parameters.@xcite    the abl community widely uses sonic anemometers for turbulent flux measurements in fields .",
    "in contrast to hot wires , these sensors require much lesser periodic calibration and maintenance .",
    "unfortunately , path lengths ( @xmath5 10 cm ) and sampling rate ( @xmath5 20 hz ) of conventional sonic anemometers are too coarse for direct @xmath0 estimation . in this paper , we will explore if sonic anemometer measurements , in lieu of hot wire data , can be reliably used for indirect estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "one of the most popular indirect @xmath0 estimation methods is associated with the scaling of sixth - order structure function.@xcite with certain plausible assumptions , one can show that:@xcite @xmath6 using eqs . 1 - 2",
    ", one gets : @xmath7 . chambers and antonia@xcite used this relatively simple indirect approach and obtained @xmath8 0.2 in the atmospheric surface layer . from adequate statistical convergence standpoint , estimation of higher - order ( specifically sixth - order in this context ) structure functions require very long time series.@xcite for instance , chambers and antonia@xcite used several runs of 15 min duration at a hot wire sampling frequency of @xmath5 1.2 khz ( i.e. , @xmath5 1 million samples per series ) . on the other hand ,",
    "15 - 30 min sonic anemometer - based abl turbulence series would typically consist of only 20,000 to 40,000 samples .",
    "understandably , the estimates of @xmath0 from sonic anemometer series using the traditional sixth - order structure function approach will not be very reliable .",
    "this and some other theoretical considerations explained in the next section , motivate us to use an alternative estimation approach , called the magnitude cumulant analysis , recently introduced by delour et al.@xcite . in this approach , only second - order magnitude cumulants ( rather than data - intensive sixth - order structure functions ) are needed to estimate the intermittency coefficient ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the inter - related objectives of this paper are twofold :    * assess the potential of the magnitude cumulant analysis in detecting and estimating intermittency from short - length coarse - resolution ( sonic anemometer - acquired ) abl measurements ; and * design a rigorous hypothesis - testing framework which would reduce the likelihood of spurious detection of a non - zero @xmath0 from non - intermittent ( monofractal ) series .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe the magnitude cumulant analysis technique . the iterative amplitude adjusted fourier transform ( iaaft ) algorithm - based surrogate analysis , originally developed by the chaos theory community for detection of nonlinearity in time series,@xcite",
    "is shown to be very robust and reliable for intermittency hypothesis - testing .",
    "the iaaft algorithm is presented in section iii .",
    "an extensive collection of observational data from various field campaigns is used in this study and section iv provides brief descriptions of these field datasets .",
    "comprehensive results of intermittency estimation are presented in section v and compared with published literature wherever possible .",
    "lastly , section vi summarizes our results and discusses perspectives for future research on the intriguing question of how atmospheric stability affects intermittency properties of boundary layer turbulence .",
    "in the turbulence literature , the scaling exponent spectrum , @xmath9 , is defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the so - called @xmath12-th order structure function . as before , the angular bracket denotes spatial averaging and @xmath4 is a separation distance that varies within the inertial range .",
    "if the scaling exponent @xmath9 is a nonlinear function of @xmath12 , then the field is called ` multifractal ' , otherwise it is termed ` monofractal'.@xcite in the traditional structure function approach , estimation of @xmath13 requires a log - log plot of @xmath14 vs @xmath4 and subsequent extraction of the slope using a least - squares linear regression fit over a scaling regime ( the inertial range ) . for short time series , computation of @xmath14 is problematic due to statistical convergence .",
    "moreover , this problem is further compounded by the fact that even if the series is sufficiently long for statistical convergence of higher - order moments , the underlying nature of intermittency might theoretically limit the range over which the equivalency of statistical and geometrical interpretations of intermittency hold.@xcite as a result , even accurate estimates of higher - order statistical moment will degenerate to a linear behavior of @xmath9 for @xmath12 larger than some @xmath15 prohibiting therefore an accurate estimation of intermittency using the structure function approach ( see lashermes et al.@xcite for details ) .",
    "an alternative reliable method , first advocated by delour et al.@xcite , is to use the magnitude cumulant analysis . in this approach ,",
    "the relationship between the moments of velocity increments ( @xmath16 ) and the magnitude cumulants ( @xmath17 ) reads as:@xcite @xmath18 where    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    from eqs .",
    "3 - 5 , it is straightforward to express the scaling exponent spectrum as:@xcite @xmath22 furthermore , by invoking a relationship between velocity increments @xmath23 and local rate of dissipation fields @xmath24 ( similar to eq .",
    "2 ) , one can arrive at:@xcite @xmath25 therefore , estimation of the intermittency exponent @xmath0 would only require the computation of second - order magnitude cumulant , i.e. , the second central moment of @xmath26 ( eq .",
    "5b ) .    for large separation ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the integral length scale )",
    ", it is well documented that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of velocity increments ( @xmath29 ) approaches a gaussian distribution .",
    "for this scenario , the following results can be derived analytically :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the euler gamma constant = 0.577216 , and @xmath32 is apry s constant = 1.2020569 .",
    "these asymptotic values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 would be very useful to demarcate scaling regions in the case of short - length time series .",
    "it is noted that instead of a physical space - based magnitude cumulant analysis approach ( i.e , eqs .",
    "4 - 5 ) , one could also use wavelet - based magnitude cumulant analysis ( see venugopal et al.@xcite for a geophysical application ) .",
    "a wavelet - based approach becomes necessary for nonstationary signals and signals with hlder exponents ( @xmath36 ) outside the window of @xmath37$].@xcite in turbulence ,",
    "@xmath38 is close to k41 value of @xmath39 and to best of our knowledge always found to be within the window of @xmath40$].@xcite thus , in the present study we decided to employ physical space - based magnitude cumulant analysis approach .    magnitude cumulant analysis of a synthetic fractional brownian motion with @xmath41 ( which displays k41 like @xmath42 spectrum ) is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the dashed line in @xmath33 vs. @xmath43 plot has the expected slope of @xmath39 . for almost the entire scaling range ,",
    "both @xmath34 and @xmath35 remain close to the theoretical gaussian values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "this signal does not show any sign of multifractality ( expected ) as the slope of @xmath34 vs. @xmath43 can not be claimed to be different from zero .",
    "noise is omnipresent in any measured signal and turbulence signals are no exceptions .",
    "in addition to noise , limited amount of data ( finite sample settings ) in most field measurements could challenge intermittency detection and estimation even with the magnitude cumulant analysis method ( e.g. , assessment of a small non - zero slope in the @xmath34 vs. @xmath46 plots ) . in this paper",
    ", we utilize a hypothesis - testing framework , based on surrogate analysis , in conjunction with magnitude cumulant analysis , for detecting and accurately estimating intermittency from short - length sonic anemometer measurements .    the concept of surrogates ( stochastic realizations which preserve only certain characteristics of a process ) was introduced into the chaos theory literature to provide a rigorous statistical test for the null hypothesis that an observed time series has been generated by a linear stochastic process ( see theiler et al.,@xcite kantz and schreiber,@xcite basu and foufoula - georgiou,@xcite and the references there in ) . over the years",
    ", several varieties of surrogates ( randomly shuffled surrogates , fourier phase randomized surrogates , iterative amplitude adjusted fourier transform - iaaft surrogates , stochastic iaaft surrogates , and so on ) have been proposed in the literature.@xcite in this paper , we will use the iaaft algorithm proposed by schreiber and schmitz.@xcite iaaft surrogates preserve the correlation structure ( thus power spectrum owing to wiener - khinchin theorem ) and the probability density function of a given time series .",
    "apart from nonlinearity detection,@xcite the iaaft surrogates have also been used to define a precipitation forecast quality index,@xcite and to generate synthetic cloud fields.@xcite    in the turbulence literature , surrogate analysis - based hypothesis - testing is virtually nonexistent with an exception of the paper by nikora et al.@xcite they used simple fourier phase randomization approach ( pdf of the original turbulence series was not preserved ) in identifying the effects of turbulence intermittency and spectral energy flux . in comparison to the fourier phase randomized approach , the iaaft algorithm used in the present study designs stronger statistical test ( owing to its ability to preserve the integral pdf of the original signal ) for the null hypothesis that an observed turbulence series is non - intermittent .    in fig .",
    "2 , a sonic anemometer turbulence series and its iaaft surrogate are shown . by construction",
    ", they have the same pdf ( bottom - right plot of fig .",
    "2 ) and virtually indistinguishable autocorrelation function ( bottom - left plot of fig .",
    "basic properties of the original turbulence series and its surrogate are provided in table i. @xmath47 and @xmath28 denote integral time and length scales , respectively .",
    "@xmath48    where @xmath49 is the autocorrelation function .",
    "from fig . 2 and table i , we can safely infer that the iaaft surrogate captures the integral pdf and autocorrelation function of the original velocity series rather accurately .",
    "later on , we will show that the iaaft surrogates do not have the ability to capture the scale - dependent pdfs of velocity increments and this forms the basis for the proposed intermittency hypothesis - testing .      +     +    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     mean flow characteristics of all the field measurements are given in table ii .",
    "for all the analyses , we have invoked taylor s hypothesis to convert time series to spatial series .",
    "in this section , hot wire measurements and their surrogates are analyzed to : ( a ) demonstrate the ability of the magnitude cumulant analysis to accurately estimate the intermittency structure of turbulent velocity series , and ( b ) establish that the surrogate series , while preserving the pdf and spectrum of the original data , destroy the intermittency structure .",
    "+     +    in fig .",
    "3 , the magnitude cumulants computed from the hot wire measurements of kunkel and marusic@xcite are shown .",
    "this turbulence series is 30 min long ( @xmath50 million data points ) and captures scales down to the kolmogorov scale .",
    "the following observations can be made from fig .",
    "3 :    * @xmath51 computed from the turbulence velocity signal is close to @xmath52 .",
    "it agrees quite well with the existing results from low @xmath53 laboratory experiments.@xcite * @xmath54 is approximately equal to @xmath55 .",
    "delour et al.@xcite and chevillard et al.@xcite reported @xmath56 based on several experiments and claimed it to be ` universal ' . from eq .",
    "7 , we can compute the intermittency exponent @xmath57 . in the literature ,",
    "researchers have reported @xmath0 ranging from 0.18 to 0.7.@xcite in the case of atmospheric data , the ` best ' direct estimate is @xmath58@xcite and our indirect magnitude cumulant analysis - based result is in agreement with it . * from eq .",
    "6 , we can derive : @xmath59 .",
    "3 ( bottom - right ) shows the second - order structure function .",
    "the slope of this plot gives @xmath60 .",
    "thus , our results are self - consistent .",
    "* in the inertial range , @xmath61 seems to be zero .",
    "this indicates that the statistics of the velocity increments are possibly log - normal.@xcite * @xmath62 estimated from the surrogate of the measured turbulence velocity series is zero , i.e. , the surrogate series is non - intermittent .",
    "* by construction , the surrogate series ( i.e. , turbulence without intermittency ) preserves the second - order statistics .",
    "so , @xmath63 . using this relationship , the fact that @xmath64 , and eq .",
    "6 , it is straightforward to show that : @xmath65 . in the present case this rsults in : @xmath66 ( see also fig .",
    "thus , @xmath67 is in full accord with k41 hypothesis of @xmath68.@xcite + the relationship @xmath69 has significant practical implication .",
    "it insinuates that one can roughly estimate @xmath54 ( and thus @xmath0 ) by means of first - order magnitude cumulants of turbulence and its corresponding surrogate , i.e. , @xmath70 . in our opinion , for estimating intermittency in short length geophysical signals , this simple indirect method which does not require even second - order magnitude cumulant computation would be quite useful . * in the turbulence literature , there is a general consensus that @xmath71 . from our results ,",
    "we find @xmath72 , very close to the well - accepted value .",
    "we proceed further by comparing the pdf of the velocity and surrogate increments using the skewness , asymmetry factor , and flatness defined as :    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    from fig .",
    "4 ( left ) , it is evident that the original turbulence increment series show negative skewness ( up to @xmath76 ) for small scales in accord with the existing literature ( e.g. , chevillard et al.@xcite ) .",
    "this negative skewness is believed to be related to the vortex folding and stretching process .",
    "malcot et al.@xcite argued that the asymmetry factor ( see eq .",
    "10 for definition ) is a better measure of the asymmetry of the pdf than the skewness .",
    "we found that both of these signed odd - order moments behave quite similarly ( fig .",
    "4 , left ) .",
    "the origin of spurious oscillations of these odd - order moments for large scales ( @xmath77 ) is not well understood .",
    "the flatness plot ( figure 4 , right ) also portrays anticipated characteristics .",
    "flatness corresponding to the integral scale is close to 3 ( hallmark of gaussian velocity increments ) and becomes exceedingly large for smaller scales .",
    "in contrast , the surrogate shows gaussian characteristics for all scales .",
    "this corroborates the fact that surrogates can not capture the pdfs of turbulence velocity increments .",
    "magnitude cumulants and second - order structure functions computed from a sonic anemometer series are shown in fig .",
    "the trends are very similar to fig .",
    "3 , albeit quite noisy . from this figure , we calculated @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that even in this short time series scenario , we can reliably detect intermittency with the help of iaaft surrogate ( see fig .",
    "5 top - right ) .",
    "admittedly , the estimation of @xmath81 is possibly not very accurate .",
    "the estimation can be improved by using quenched or annealed averaging strategy ( discussed below ) .",
    "+     +    it is quite difficult to manually yet objectively select scaling ranges from a large dataset ( specifically 139 near - neutral turbulence series ) .",
    "so , we used an automated scaling range of @xmath82 $ ] for individual series .",
    "here @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath28 denote mean velocity , sampling frequency , and integral length scale , respectively . from each individual turbulence series and their surrogates",
    ", we calculated the corresponding @xmath85 and @xmath81 values .",
    "subsequently , from these 139 @xmath51 , @xmath54 , @xmath86 , and @xmath62 combinations , we computed the best estimates ( ensemble mean plus / minus one standard deviation ) as : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "this averaging strategy is similar to the quenched averaging method used by arnodo et al.@xcite the key result : @xmath91 , without any doubt , once again guarantees that the iaaft surrogates can be faithfully used for turbulence intermittency detection testing .    as an alternative strategy , using the annealed averaging method@xcite ,",
    "we have also computed the average of the magnitude cumulants ( i.e. , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) from the same turbulence and surrogate datasets ( fig . 6 ) . from this figure",
    ", we estimate the slopes as : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "obviously , there is no significant discrepancy between the quenched and annealed averaged statistics , as would be wishfully expected .",
    "lastly , these statistics highlight that the relationship established in section v - a , i.e. , @xmath98 , is also valid under annealed averaging .",
    "in this work , we have established a framework based on magnitude cumulant and surrogate analyses to reliably detect and estimate the intermittency coefficient from short turbulent time series . by virtue of this framework",
    ", ensemble scaling results extracted from a large number of neutrally stratified atmospheric surface layer turbulent series ( predominantly acquired by slow response sonic anemometers ) from various field campaigns remarkably concur with well - known published ( mostly laboratory experimental ) results .",
    "the focus of the present study was on neutrally stratified atmospheric turbulence .",
    "however , it is widely known that neutral stability conditions are rarely encountered in the real atmosphere .",
    "most of the time , the atmospheric boundary layer is strongly modulated by buoyancy .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the effect of atmospheric stability is felt only at the ` buoyancy range ' , which has scales considerably larger than the inertial range .",
    "recently , aivalis et al.@xcite studied the intermittency behavior of temperature in the convective surface layer using cold wire anemometry .",
    "they found that the classical inertial range remains intact in convective surface layer and the scaling exponents approach values appropriate to the intermittent case of isotropic turbulence .",
    "they also noticed that the scaling exponents corresponding to the buoyancy range are highly anomalous .",
    "in contrast , shi et al.@xcite found that in the case of temperature , the inertial range scaling exponents are unambiguously impacted by atmospheric stability .",
    "however , their results are inconclusive in the case of velocity signals under different stability regimes .",
    "we believe that the unresolved question as to whether or not the inertial - range intermittency is influenced by large - scale anisotropic forcing of atmospheric stability is of great consequence and needs further consideration .",
    "abundant high - quality slow response data collected under different atmospheric regimes in recent years ( e.g. , cooperative atmosphere - surface exchange study - cases99@xcite ) could be coupled with the robust scaling analysis and estimation framework explored in this study in order to shed new light into this fundamental problem .",
    "we would like to thank gary kunkel and ivan marusic for providing us with the hot wire measurements taken at the sltest facility , utah .",
    "we are also grateful to all the researchers who painstakingly collected data during the davis field campaigns .",
