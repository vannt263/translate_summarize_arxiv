    "as it was mentioned above , spectra of x - ray pulsars can vary significantly over the pulse .",
    "the observed variations of spectral parameters can give information about changes of the physical conditions or parameters of the emission regions near the neutron star . in order to study their evolution over the pulse period in the case of s  we performed a pulse - phase resolved spectroscopy .",
    "the spin period was divided into 10 equal phase bins .",
    "the pulse profile has a more or less smooth shape ( fig.[fig : pprof ] ) , therefore such a division allows us both to obtain a good statistic for each spectrum and to trace well evolution of spectral parameters .    to describe phase - resolved spectra we used the same spectral model as for the analysis of the averaged spectrum ( with cyclabs prescription for the cyclotron line ; model i )",
    "it is necessary to note that the width of the cyclotron line can not be firmly determined in some phase bins due to insufficient photon statistics .",

    "energy range is presented in each panel to visualize better the variations of spectral parameters with the phase .",
    "the photon index is varying quite significantly ( from 2 to 0 ) whereas the cutoff energy is less variable staying in the range between 4 and 6 kev .",
    "we can mention also a possible tentative correlation between these parameters .",
    "the temperature of the black body component is around @xmath44 kev and is quite stable over the pulse with some variations from @xmath45 to @xmath46 kev in first three bins .",
    "variations of the cyclotron line energy and the line depth are the most interesting and important for us , as both of them are changing significantly over the pulse .",
    "in particular , the line centroid energy has minimum ( @xmath47 kev ) near the pulse profile maximum , whereas the line depth has maximum near this phase . in general ,",
    "the line energy @xmath48 is varying between @xmath49 and @xmath50 kev ( using cyclabs model for the cyclotron line ) , that is the main reason for the significant broadening of the line measured in the averaged spectrum ( @xmath51 kev ) .",
    "note that the described behaviour of the cyclotron line parameters over the pulse is very similar to the observed one in well studied bexrp v0332 + 53 when this object had nearly the same luminosity @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "from another side this behaviour is opposite to what observed in sub - critical pulsars due to different beaming properties .    to demonstrate that the observed spectral variations are real ones we show the ratio of two spectra obtained in the first ( minimal line depth ) and forth ( maximal line depth ) phase bins in fig .",
    "[ fig : sprat ] .",
    "the upper panel demonstrates corresponding models for these spectra .",
    "the ratio of the observed spectra is shown in the bottom panel with filled circles .",
    "the solid line in this panel represents the ratio of the corresponding models . a strong absorption like feature , caused by difference in line depths for these phase bins",
    "is clearly seen in this figure between 20 and 30 kev .",
    "the contribution of different continuum components ( black body and power - law with cutoff ) to the total source luminosity demonstrates a variability of their ratio over the pulse .",
    "particularly , the black body flux remains virtually constant at the level of @xmath53 , whereas power - law flux is dominating at all phases and is determining the overall pulse profile shape .",
    "the contribution of the black body emission to the total flux is varying between @xmath54 and @xmath55 per cent . using estimation of the distance to the source @xmath56 kpc ( see section 4 ) the measured black body flux corresponds to the emitting area with the radius of @xmath57 km .",
    "this value is comparable with the neutron star size , that means that the black body emission can emerge from the neutron star atmosphere heated up by the intercepted emission from the accretion column @xcite .",
    "so big radius of the illuminated ns surface area can explain virtual constancy of the black body emission component over the pulse .",
    "this hypothesis can be verified in future by a set of observations of s  at different luminosities and , hence , with different illuminated areas on the neutron star .",
    "in this work we presented detailed spectral and temporal analysis of the emission from the poorly studied bexrp s  using the _ nustar _ data collected during the presumably type ii outburst in 2015 . the energy spectrum of the source can not be fitted satisfactory with any simple continuum model but requires inclusion of the absorption feature centered at @xmath1 kev .",
    "this absorption component has a clear physical meaning and represents the cyclotron absorption line known to be main evidence for the strong magnetic field on the neutron star surface .",
    "the absorption line in the s  spectrum can be fitted both by the gaussian ( gabs model ) or lorenzian ( cyclabs model ) profiles with approximately the same quality .",
    "the line energy ( @xmath58 kev for gabs and @xmath59 kev for cyclabs ) corresponds to the magnetic field strength at the neutron star surface @xmath2 g after the correction for the gravitational redshift .",
    "the existence of the cyclotron feature is confirmed not only by the spectral fitting , but also by temporal properties of the source .",
    "particularly , the pulsed fraction dependence on the energy has a broad feature ( local decrease ) around 23 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ppfr ] ) that coincides with the position of crsf in the source spectrum .",
    "such non - monotonic dependencies of the pulsed fraction on energy were observed in several x - ray pulsars with cyclotron line in their spectra and even were proposed as a tool to search for crsfs .",
    "further evidence for the cyclotron absorption feature comes from the behaviour of the pulse profile with energy .",
    "a phase lag around the spectral feature can be clearly seen in figs [ fig : pprof ] and [ fig:2dpprof ] expressed in a wave - like structure near 2030 kev .",
    "such behaviour has been shown to be typical for a few others transient bexrps @xcite and can be explained by a natural assumption of an energy - dependent beaming of the radiation from the emitting region .",
    "the knowledge of the magnetic field strength gives us an opportunity to estimate the absolute value of the mass accretion rate needed to provide the spin - up rate measured by _",
    "fermi_/gbm at the moment of our _ nustar _",
    "observation @xmath60 s s@xmath5 . for",
    "that we used the accretion torque theories developed by different authors @xcite .",
    "these models explain the observed spin - up / down rate as a function of the neutron star parameters and depend on physics of `` accretion disc  magnetosphere '' interaction . for our calculations",
    "we used the ns magnetic dipole moment @xmath61 g @xmath62 , derived from the measured value of the magnetic field strength , @xmath63 and 10 km as the neutron star mass and radius , respectively , keeping the mass accretion rate as a free parameter .",
    "type ii outbursts in bexrps are usually accompanied by the formation of the temporary accretion disk around the neutron star revealing itself in a strong spin - up rate and properties of the noise power spectrum .",
    "therefore , as a first approximation we used eq .",
    "( 15 ) from @xcite to estimate the bolometric luminosity @xmath64   needed to support the measured spin - up rate .",
    "given the flux from s  during the _ nustar _",
    "observation @xmath65   the distance to the system can be estimated as @xmath66 kpc .",
    "the torque model by @xcite is not the only one developed for the disc accretion . in all these models",
    "the total torque can be expressed in the form @xmath67 .",
    "the only parameter of the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath68 is so called fastness parameter @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are magnetospheric and corotation radii , correspondingly .",
    "we used different prescriptions for the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath72 which describes physical properties of the accretion disc interaction with the magnetosphere .",
    "particularly , utilizing approaches from @xcite and @xcite we got distances @xmath73 kpc and @xmath66 kpc , correspondingly .",
    "such not large dispersion of the distances derived from different models is due to the source being far from the spin equilibrium , where the difference in the above - mentioned models is maximal ( see , e.g. , fig . 2 from * ? ? ?",
    "radius of the magnetosphere in these models is assumed to be a fraction of the alfv@xmath74n radius @xmath75 . in the calculations above we assumed the parameter @xmath76 , however its exact value is not known and supposed to be between 0.5 and 0.7 ( see , e.g. ,",
    "* and references therein ) . to estimate a possible influence of this parameter for our results we recalculated distances with @xmath77",
    "this affected the derived values very insignificantly shifting the distance estimations based on models by @xcite and @xcite to @xmath7824 and @xmath7821 kpc , respectively .",
    "these estimations make s  one of the most distant high - mass x - ray binary in the galaxy @xcite , putting it to the opposite side of the milky way .",
    "it is important to note , that the distance estimations based on the temporal properties of x - ray pulsars have quite large systematic uncertainties ( of the order of 1520 per cent ) due to model dependency , an unknown efficiency of the accretion and effects of a possible emission beaming , therefore should be considered with the caution .",
    "nevertheless , a large distance to the source ( @xmath7915 kpc ) is estimated from the optical data as well @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of the estimated distance values can be considered as a systematic uncertainty of this method .",
    "it is interesting to note , that if our estimations of distance ( @xmath80 kpc ) are correct then s  exceeds the so - called critical luminosity above which the accretion column begins to grow above the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "the value of the critical luminosity as well as conditions for growing of the accretion column are still under debates and depend on the physical models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a set of observations in different intensity states during the outburst is needed to verify this hypothesis by , e.g. , observing of the anti - correlation between the cyclotron energy and source luminosity , as seen in at least one bright transient x - ray pulsar v0332 + 53 @xcite .",
    "presence of such an anti - correlation in another similar source , 4u0115 + 63 , is still under debates .",
    "the recent outburst from bexrp s  was only the third transient event when the source came into the view of x - ray instruments .",
    "thanks to the _ nustar _ wide energy coverage and high sensitivity we were able to discover a cyclotron absorption line with centroid energy @xmath81 kev , corresponding to the neutron star magnetic field strength @xmath2  g typical for the known x - ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "the presence of the cyclotron line in the source spectrum is also supported by the behaviour of the pulse profile and pulsed fraction with the energy .",
    "the pulse - phase resolved spectroscopy revealed significant variations of the cyclotron line parameters over the pulse .",
    "particularly , the line centroid energy is anti - correlating with the intensity , whereas the line depth shows a correlation .",

    ". virtual constancy of the period since the source discovery in 1975 and a significant spin - up observed during both outbursts ( up to @xmath82 s s@xmath5 ) implies action of deceleration torques between outbursts .",
    "taking into account the last measured value of the pulse period during the previous outburst @xcite and its first measured value during the current outburst ( fig.[fig : lc ] ) we can estimate roughly a spin - down between 2007 and 2015 outbursts as @xmath83 s s@xmath5 .",
    "this value is more than an order of magnitude lower than the spin - up during the outbursts and comparable with the spin - down observed between outbursts in other bexrbs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
