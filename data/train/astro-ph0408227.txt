    "the analysis of photometric and spectroscopic observations of double - lined detached eclipsing binaries remains one of the most powerful ways to investigate the properties of individual stars .",
    "the analysis of light curves and radial velocity curves allows the masses , radii and surface gravities of two stars to be found to an accuracy of better than 1% .",
    "further analysis using spectral synthesis or photometric index calibration techniques also allows the derivation of accurate effective temperatures , absolute magnitudes and distances of the components of the eclipsing system ( andersen , 1991 ; southworth , maxted & smalley , 2004c ) .",
    "accurate dimensions of a detached eclipsing binary ( deb ) provide a discriminating test of theoretical stellar evolutionary models because the two components of the system have the same age and chemical composition but , in general , different masses and radii ( southworth , maxted & smalley , 2004b ) .",
    "the observation and analysis of debs in stellar clusters and associations may allow the calculation of accurate dimensions of more than two stars of the same age and initial chemical composition ( southworth , maxted & smalley , 2004a ) .",
    "the distance of the cluster can be found from analysis of an eclipsing member , without the use of theoretical calculations and free of the difficulties of the main - sequence fitting technique .",
    "furthermore , the age , metallicity and helium abundance of the cluster as a whole can be found from comparison of the observed masses and radii of the deb with theoretical stellar models ( southworth _ et al_. , 2004a ) .",
    "another use of debs is to investigate the physical processes at work in single stars .",
    "this is particularly useful if one or both components belongs to a class of peculiar or poorly understood stars , for example slowly pulsating b stars ( e.g. , v539arae ; clausen , 1996 ) , or metallic - line stars ( e.g. , wwcamelopardalis ; lacy _ et al_. , 2002 ) .",
    "metallic astars are well represented in the compilation of accurate eclipsing binary data by andersen ( 1991 ) but the physical processes and particular conditions of occurrence are still not fully understood .",
    "wwaurigae ( hd46052 , hip31173 , @xmath1 , period = 2.52d ) is a deb with an accurate hipparcos parallax distance of @xmath2pc ( perryman , _ et al_. , 1997 ) .",
    "its eclipsing nature was discovered independently by solviev ( 1918 ) and schwab ( 1918 ) .",
    "huffer & kopal ( 1951 ) and piotrowski & serkowski ( 1956 ) undertook photoelectric observations but were both hampered by bright skies .",
    "etzel ( 1975 ) observed excellent photoelectric light curves in the strmgren @xmath3 filters , consisting of about one thousand observations in each filter .",
    "kiyokawa & kitamura ( 1975 ) published excellent @xmath4 light curves of wwaur and analysed them using a procedure based on rectification ( russell & merrill , 1952 ; kitamura , 1967 ) .",
    "kitamura , kim & kiyokawa ( 1976 ) published good photographic spectra and derived accurate absolute dimensions of wwaur by combining their results with those of kiyokawa & kitamura .",
    "the rotational velocities of the components were found to be 35 and 55kms@xmath5  from ccd spectra by abt & morrell ( 1995 ) , who also classified the stars as am ( a2,a5,a7 ) where the bracketed spectral types have been obtained using the ca k line , balmer lines , and metallic lines .",
    "hd23642 ( hip17704 , @xmath6 , period = 2.46d ) was discovered to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary by pearce ( 1957 ) and abt ( 1958 ) .",
    "its hipparcos parallax gives a distance of @xmath7pc ( perryman , _",
    "et al_. , 1998 ) .",
    "abt & levato ( 1978 ) provided a spectral classification of a0vp(si ) + am , where the metallic - line character of the secondary star relies on the presence of strong fe lines .",
    "torres ( 2003 ) discovered shallow secondary eclipses in the hipparcos photometric data of hd23642 and also presented an accurate spectroscopic orbit .",
    "munari _ et al_.  ( 2004 , hereafter m04 ) derived precise absolute masses and radii of both components from five high - resolution chelle spectra , and complete @xmath8 photoelectric light curves . from consideration of the effective temperatures and bolometric magnitudes of the components , and using the wilson - devinney light curve fitting code ( wilson & devinney , 1971 ; wilson , 1993 ) they found the distance to hd23642 to be @xmath9pc , where the quoted error is the formal error of the fit .",
    "hd23642 is is an important system because it is a member of the pleiades open cluster , for which the distance is controversial .",
    "the pleiades is a nearby young open star cluster which has been exhaustively studied by many researchers .",
    "the ` long ' distance scale of @xmath10pc is supported by main sequence fitting analyses and photometric calibrations ( e.g. , johnson , 1957 ; crawford & perry , 1976 ; meynet , mermilliod & maeder , 1993 ) and analysis of the astrometric binary atlas ( pan , shao & kulkarni , 2004 ) .",
    "trigonometric parallax observations from the ground ( @xmath11pc ; gatewood _ et al_. , 2000 ) and from the hubble space telescope ( @xmath12pc ; benedict , 2004 ) also agree with the ` long ' distance scale .",
    "the ` short ' distance scale of @xmath13pc is derived from hipparcos parallaxes ( van leeuwen , 2004 ) but some researchers have suggested that the hipparcos parallaxes are correlated on small angular scales ( makarov , 2002 ) .",
    "however , vanleeuwen ( 1999 ) has found other nearby open clusters with main sequences as faint as the pleiades ( located with the use of hipparcos parallaxes ) .",
    "castellani _ et al_.  ( 2002 ) have shown that current theoretical stellar evolutionary models can fit the pleiades main sequence if a low metal abundance of @xmath14 is adopted .",
    "however , stello & nissen ( 2001 ) used a metallicity - insensitive photometric technique to demonstrate that , if the hipparcos parallaxes were correct , the main sequence pleiades stars were implausibly fainter than their counterparts in the field . also , boesgaard & friel ( 1990 ) have measured the iron abundance of the pleiades to be approximately solar ( @xmath15}}= -0.034 \\pm 0.024 $ ] ) from high - resolution spectra of twelve f dwarfs in the cluster .",
    "pinsonneault _ et al_.  ( 1998 ) and soderblom _",
    "et al_.  ( 1998 ) investigated this discrepancy in distance determinations by performing a main sequence fitting analysis of the pleiades and by attempting to discover nearby subluminous stars with solar metal abundance .",
    "they concluded that the hipparcos measurements were most likely wrong and also noted that the most discrepant measurements belong to stars in the centre of the pleiades , where the stellar density is the highest .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion that the hipparcos parallaxes are biased where the apparent stellar density is high .",
    "further details can be found in southworth , maxted & smalley ( 2004c ) .",
    "a total of 59 grating spectra were obtained in 2002 october using the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope on la palma , covering the wavelengths 42204500  at a two - pixel resolution of 0.2 .",
    "radial velocities were determined from the observed spectra using the two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm todcor ( zucker & mazeh , 1994 ) . in this algorithm two template spectra",
    "are simultaneously cross - correlated against each observed spectrum for a range of possible velocities for each template .",
    "template spectra of seven standard stars , with spectral types between a0iv and f5v , were used , with circular spectroscopic orbits being fitting to the radial velocities calculated using each combination of spectra .",
    "the final spectroscopic orbital parameters are calculated from the mean and 1@xmath16 uncertainties of the individual good spectroscopic orbits .",
    "the final spectroscopic orbital parameters are @xmath17kms@xmath5 , @xmath18kms@xmath5 , for a circular orbit with an orbital period of 2.52d .",
    "this gives a mass ratio of @xmath19 and individual minimum masses of @xmath20@xmath21  and @xmath22@xmath21 .",

    "it is applicable only to eclipsing binaries which are sufficiently well detached for the stellar shapes to be close to spherical , as in the case of wwaur .",
    "investigations showed that the light curves display negligible eccentricity and third light so these quantities were fixed at zero for the final solutions .",
    "the light curves and their best fits are plotted in figure  [ fig : wwaur : lcfit ] .",
    "+    uncertainties in the values of the photometric parameters have been estimated using monte carlo simulations ( southworth , maxted & smalley , 2004b ) .",
    "after finding the best fit , the model light curve was evaluated at the phases of the observed datapoints .",
    "random gaussian noise , of the same size as the standard error of the fit , was added to simulate observational noise .",
    "ebop was used to fit the resulting ` observation - like ' light curve , and this process was undertaken ten thousand times for each real light curve .",
    "the @xmath3 photometric indices for the individual components of wwaur are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the primary and secondary stars respectively .",
    "the calibration of moon & dworetsky ( 1985 ) then gives effective temperatures of @xmath29k and @xmath30k for the two stars and indicates that the light of the system suffers from negligible interstellar absorption .",
    "if the system value of the h@xmath31 index is assumed to be a reasonable estimate for the individual values for each star , the same results are found and it is confirmed that interstellar absorption is negligible .",

    "the positions of the components of hd23642 in the mass  radius plane are consistent with the metal abundance of the pleiades being solar or slightly supersolar .",

    "the components of hd23642 can not be fitted in the mass  radius plane by models of metal abundance or helium abundance significantly different from the solar abundances ; for a solar chemical composition the predictions of the granada stellar evolutionary models are consistent with the dimensions of hd23642 for ages between 125 and 175myr .",

    "there are a significant number of debs with components between 1.5 and 2.5@xmath21  which have accurate masses and radii .",
    "we have taken a list from andersen ( 1991 ) and added eight systems which have been studied more recently ( eicep , wwcam , bpvul , ggori , fsmon , v364lac and wwaur and hd23642 ) .",
    "these stars have been plotted in mass  radius , temperature  gravity , period  mass and period  radius plots ( figures [ fig : mrplot ] , [ fig : tgplot ] , [ fig : pmplot ] and [ fig : prplot ] ) .",
    "it can be seen from the figures above that there is no region of astrophysical parameter space for which all stars are metallic - lined , although there is a cluster of am stars around mass @xmath38@xmath21  and surface gravity @xmath39 ( cms@xmath5 ) which includes both components of wwaur .",
    "suggestions that metallic - lined stars have slightly larger radii than expected for their spectral type ( budaj , 1996 ) are therefore not confirmed .",
    "a - type stars of higher mass , though , do seem to need a lower surface gravity to be am stars .",
    "as the predictions of theoretical models of approximately solar chemical composition can successfully match the masses and radii of both hd23642 and wwaur , the metallic - lined spectrum phenomenon is confirmed to be a surface feature which does not significantly modify the interior conditions of the star .",
    "it is also clearly not a reflection of an overall high metal abundance .",
    "it remains unclear why some stars display metallic spectral lines when many similar ones do not .",
    "it should be remembered that using well - studied debs to investigate phenomena , such as enhanced metallic lines , can be misleading .",
    "the observational sample is very biased towards slightly evolved stars ( andersen , 1991 ) because these debs are more likely to show eclipses .",
    "a bias also exists towards debs with mass ratios close to unity because the observational requirements of such systems are more easily satisfied .",
    "adopting the astrophysical parameters of hd23642 from table  [ table:23642:dimensions ] and using bolometric corrections from bessell , castelli & plez ( 1998 ) to convert absolte bolometric magnitudes into absolute visual magnitudes , we find a distance to hd23642 of @xmath40pc .",
    "whilst this is an acceptable result to adopt for the final distance to hd23642 , it is still affected by ( probably small ) systematic error due to the use of bolometric corrections calculated from theoretical models .    the distance found by m04 , @xmath41pc , was derived using the above method but is significantly different from the result we obtain .",
    "the probable reason for this , which is consistent with the results given by m04 , is that the absolute bolometric magnitudes given by m04 were calculated using values of the solar absolute bolometric magnitude and luminosity of @xmath42 and @xmath43w , whereas the bolometric corrections used ( bessell _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) were calculated with @xmath44 and @xmath45w .",
    "this inconsistency is sufficient to explain the difference between the distance derived by m04 and by ourselves , from the same observational data .",
    "an alternative to considering the unobserved parts of the stellar spectral energy distributions is to use empirical relations between effective temperature and the wavelength - dependent surface brightness of a star . in this method",
    "the angular diameter of the star is compared to its linear diameter , determined from photometric analysis , to find the distance .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in this method is usually the light ratio , found from the photometric analysis , needed to calculate the individual magnitudes of the components of the deb from the apparent magnitude of the system .",
    "if the effective temperatures of the two stars are known independently , this difficulty can be bypassed by comparing the apparent magnitude of the system to the flux - weighted combined angular diameter of the two stars .    from consideration of the definitions of surface brightness and angular",
    "diameter , it can be shown that the distance to a deb is given by @xmath46 ^ 2 +                                \\left[\\frac{2 r_{\\rm b}}{\\phi_{\\rm b}^{(m_\\lambda = 0)}}\\right]^2 } \\ ] ] where , for a distance given in parsecs , the stellar absolute radii , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are given in au , the zeroth - magnitude angular diameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given in arcseconds and @xmath51 represents a broad - band filter passband .",
    "calibrations for @xmath52 are given in terms of effective temperature by kervella _",
    "et al_.  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the scatter of the fits is smaller at infrared wavelengths .",
    "we have applied the calibrations for the @xmath53 and @xmath54 filters ( using tycho apparent magnitudes transformed to the johnson system ) and for the @xmath55 filters ( using 2mass data transformed to the saao system ) .",
    "we adopt the result from the @xmath56 filter calibration , a distance of @xmath57pc , as our final distance to hd23642 and so to the pleiades .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in this distance is from the uncertainty in the apparent @xmath56 magnitude of hd23642 .",
    "preliminary results have been given from analysis of the a - type deb wwaurigae , which is composed of two metallic - lined stars .",
    "the masses have been derived to accuracies of 0.3% and the radii to accuracies of 0.5% ; predictions of the granada theoretical stellar evolutionary models agree with the dimensions of the stars for an approximately solar chemical composition and an age of @xmath58myr . however , the agreement between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 light curves and the light curve of huffer & kopal is not good . if the latter data are rejected , the ratio of the radii increases to @xmath59 , and the masses and radii of the two stars are unable to be fitted by theoretical models for one single age .",
    "for this reason , the study of wwaurigae presented here must be regarded as preliminary .",
    "hd23642 is an a - type deb which is a member of the pleiades open cluster , for which the distance is currently controversial .",
    "the data of m04 have been reanalysed to provide robust parameter values and uncertainties .",
    "the metal abundance of the pleiades has been estimated by comparing the masses and radii of the component stars of hd23642 with the predictions of theoretical stellar models . the resulting metal abundance , approximately solar , disagrees with suggestions that the ` short ' and ` long ' distances to the pleiades can be reconciled by adopting a low metal abundance for the cluster .",
    "the distance to hd23642 has been estimated to be @xmath0pc from the use of surface brightness  effective temperature relations provided by kervella _ et al_.  ( 2004 ) .",
    "this distance is in agreement with the ` long ' distance to the pleiades and in disagreement with the hipparcos distance to hd23642 and the pleiades .",
