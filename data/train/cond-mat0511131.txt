    "a random growth is initially observed , with negligible spatial correlations in the local thicknesses .",
    "subsequently , diffusion , desorption and other mechanisms introduce surface correlations and , consequently , a crossover from random to correlated growth is observed .",

    "this was observed by albano and co - workers @xcite , who studied numerically two - component models in which different rules for the aggregation of the same species are chosen , with complementary probabilities ( they are simply called competitive models by several authors @xcite ) .",
    "the first component of those models , with probability @xmath6 , was random deposition ( rd ) : particles attach to the top of the column of incidence independently of the neighboring heights . in their first competitive model ( called rd - bd model ) , the second component was ballistic deposition ( bd ) @xcite , with probability @xmath4 . in their second competitive model ( called rd - rdsr ) , the correlated component was random deposition with surface relaxation ( rdsr ) @xcite .",
    "as expected from the absence of correlations in rd , the universal scaling exponents @xmath18 , @xmath36 and @xmath24 of the competitive models are those of the universality class of the correlated component @xcite .",

    "since those works analyzed particular models in the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite and in the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite classes , the picture that emerged from those results was that the exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 are related to the universality class of the dominant process : @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the crossover to kpz , @xmath48 and @xmath44 in the crossover to ew .",

    "thus , a complete theoretical explanation of the values of these crossover exponents is still lacking .    here",
    "we will present a scaling approach which provides such explanation through a connection of roughness amplitudes , crossover times and the microscopic rules of the lattice models .",
    "it can be applied to all spatial dimensions and to all types of correlated growth , and agrees with our numerical results for models in three different universality classes and with numerical results from other authors works @xcite .",

    "the relations between @xmath0 and the parameters of the discrete models are subsequently obtained by scaling arguments , partially rephrasing those of braunstein and lam @xcite .",
    "these arguments lead to a separation of the lattice models in two groups : the first one includes solid - on - solid models with single particle deposition attempts , for which @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and the second one includes models with lateral aggregation , for which @xmath51 and @xmath41 .",
    "this classification is independent of the universality class of the correlated process , consequently kpz processes may be found in both groups , i. e. with different crossover exponents .",
    "moreover , our theoretical approach comprises not only two - component models involving rd , but can be extended to other models with the same crossover .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath0 is the time in which the roughness of random growth ( eq . [ wrandom ] ) matches the growing roughness of the correlated process , eq . ( [ scalingwgr ] )",

    "the neighboring columns randomly grow , thus the local roughness @xmath143 is of the order of the rd roughness @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath143 represents height fluctuations within narrow windows , whose sizes are of the order of one lattice unit , in a large lattice and at times long enough for significant correlations to appear inside those windows . on the other hand , when the global roughness @xmath34 attains saturation , the whole system is also highly correlated .",
    "thus , if the total system size is @xmath144 ( i.e. system size is small but not equal to @xmath128 ) , this system is a narrow window , and we expect @xmath145 . since @xmath146 in this case ( eq . [ fv ] with @xmath147 ) , we obtain eq .",
    "( [ atx ] ) .",
    "certainly this argument does not apply to systems with anomalous scaling , where local and global roughness have different scaling properties , but that is not the case of the lattice models analyzed here or in related works .",
    "now we consider the particular properties of the lattice models , focusing on their small length - scale features .",
    "our arguments are similar to those of braustein and lam @xcite for the rd - bd and the rd - rdsr models , but here we will emphasize the independence of the results on the universality class of the process . in all cases ,",

    "thus , in a given column , the mean time interval between two successive depositions that buildup the correlations along the substrate is @xmath148 .",
    "since bd involves lateral aggregation , a single deposition attempt following this model rules introduces height correlations between that column and the neighboring ones .",

    "thus , within a time interval of order @xmath149 , significant local correlations are not generated . instead , in order to the rejection mechanism to balance the random growth locally",
    ", it is necessary that the number of rejected attempts at a given column be of the same order of the height difference between the neighbors . while the number of rsos attempts at a given column during time @xmath62 increases as @xmath154 , the local height difference in random growth increases as @xmath155 . matching these values we obtain the crossover time @xmath5 for the rd - rsos model .",
    "this result gives @xmath70 and @xmath44 in all dimensions .",
    "the exponent @xmath45 depends on the substrate dimension due to its dependence on the scaling exponent @xmath36 ( eqs . [ defgamma ] and [ ctx ] ) .",
    "the same arguments apply to the crossover from random to ew scaling observed in the rd - rdsr model  @xcite , since a single diffusion event to a lower height does not suppress a large height difference immediately . in the rd - crsos model , there is a combination of rejection of aggregation at high columns and diffusion to plateaus or valleys , but this combination also does not introduce significant height correlations immediately .",
    "consequently , @xmath5 for these models , which lead to @xmath70 and @xmath44 .",
    "the features of the generalized rsos model are explained by extending the arguments of ref .",

    "in fact , no reference to a particular system dimension was done in the above arguments .",
    "instead , they were only based on random growth properties ( eq . [ wrandom ] ) , the family - vicsek relation ( eq .",
    "[ fv ] ) and the hypothesis of the existence of a crossover from random to correlated growth .",
    "our analysis clearly separated solid - on - solid models with single particle aggregation attempts and models with lateral aggregation .",

    "universal relations between the crossover time @xmath0 and the amplitudes of saturation roughness and saturation time were obtained from random deposition properties and family - vicsek scaling , for any spatial dimension .",
    "the lattice models with that crossover can be separated in two groups : the first one with lateral aggregation , such as ballistic deposition , in which correlations spread faster , and the second one of the solid - on - solid models with single particle aggregation attempts , which require much longer times for the correlated aggregation to balance the random growth . while @xmath168 in the first group , where @xmath4 is the small probability of the correlated mechanism to work , in the second class we showed that @xmath169 .",
    "these relations are independent of the universality class of the process : although the first group is expected to include only kpz processes , due to the presence of lateral growth , several kpz models are also found in the second group .",
    "all these features are confirmed by simulations of lattice models in three different universality classes and different substrate dimensions , partly obtained from other authors work . in @xmath56 , relations between the probability @xmath4 and the coefficients of the kpz equation can be obtained for both groups of models .",

    "scaling , although the connection between scaling amplitudes and the coefficients of the continuous equation is not trivial in @xmath170 , the numerical calculation of @xmath10 and @xmath11 may help the search for those relations , at least in the small @xmath10 , small @xmath11 limit ."
