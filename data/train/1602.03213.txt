    "bombarding a solid surface with a broad ion beam can produce a remarkable variety of self - assembled nanoscale patterns , including periodic height modulations and mounds arranged in hexagonal arrays of surprising regularity .",
    "@xcite the spontaneous formation of these patterns is not just fascinating in its own right : ion bombardment has the potential to become a cost - effective method to rapidly fabricate large - area nanostructures at length scales beyond the limits of conventional optical lithography .    over the past decade",
    ", an abundance of experimental work has established that the deposition of impurities during ion bombardment of an elemental material has a profound effect on the nanoscale patterns that develop on its surface.@xcite the pioneering experimental work in the field was carried out by ozaydin _ et al._,@xcite who bombarded a silicon sample at normal incidence in ultrahigh vacuum and found that it remained flat .",
    "in contrast , if a trace amount of molybdenum atoms was deposited during the bombardment , a disordered array of nanodots formed on the surface .",
    "zhang , brtzmann and hofsss subsequently observed that if silicon is subjected to normal - incidence ion bombardment with concurrent oblique - incidence deposition of iron atoms , surface ripples develop if the iron flux is sufficiently high.@xcite the ripple wavevector was parallel to the surface projection of the incidence direction of the iron impurities . in follow - up work , these experiments were repeated , but with a range of metals replacing fe , including ni , mo , w , and au.@xcite the most pronounced tendency to form ripples was observed for the metals fe , ni , mo , and w , which form si - rich disilicides with the stoichiometry mesi@xmath1 .",
    "gold , on the other hand , has no stable silicides and no patterns were observed , even for high au surface coverages .",
    "these results suggest that compound formation can play a key role in determining whether or not surface ripples develop during ion bombardment with co - deposition of impurities .",
    "inspired by the work of zhang , brtzmann and hofsss , we demonstrated that if impurities are deposited obliquely on a solid surface during normal - incidence ion bombardment , an instability can occur that results purely from the interaction between the topography of the surface and the surface layer in which impurities are present.@xcite this instability only occurs if the sputter yields of the target material and the impurities differ .",
    "it leads to the formation of a surface ripple with its wavevector along the projection of the impurity beam onto the sample surface , as observed by zhang , brtzmann and hofsss . in later work",
    ", the effect of compound formation was incorporated into the theory.@xcite    intriguing recent experiments by moon _",
    "et al . _",
    "present a challenge to the prevailing view of ion sputtering with concurrent impurity deposition.@xcite in these experiments , a silicon surface was bombarded with an argon ion beam and gold impurities were simultaneously deposited .",
    "both the argon ions and gold atoms were obliquely incident on the surface .",
    "gold was chosen as the impurity because it has no stable silicides .",
    "the angle of ion incidence was selected in an especially clever fashion : for the chosen angle , the sputter yields of gold and silicon are equal . despite this ,",
    "ripples with their wavevector parallel to the projected impurity incidence direction formed on the solid surface if the gold concentration was sufficiently high .",
    "what is more , for still higher gold concentrations , the ripple wavevector rotated by @xmath0 .",
    "finally , for sufficiently low gold concentrations , the surface remained flat .    the experimental results of moon _",
    "et al . _  can not be explained by the theory advanced in ref .   because the silicon and gold had the same sputter yield in those experiments .",
    "additionally , the theory in ref .   does not yield ripples with their wavevector perpendicular to the projected impurity incidence direction for any choice of parameter values .    in this paper , we modify the existing theory of ion bombardment with concurrent impurity deposition to take into account the effect that the near - surface impurities have on the collision cascades .",
    "this requires that the sigmund model of ion sputtering@xcite be generalized .",
    "once this crucial modification has been made , the theory can produce precisely the same phenomena as moon _",
    "et al . _  observed .",
    "in particular , as the impurity concentration is increased , the theory can successively yield a flat surface , a rippled surface with its wavevector along the projected direction of ion incidence , and a rippled surface with its wavevector rotated by @xmath0 .    to make our theory as widely applicable as possible",
    ", we will not restrict our attention to ar - ion bombardment of si with au co - deposition .",
    "instead , we will study a sample initially composed of entirely of atomic species @xmath2 that is subjected to bombardment with a noble gas ion beam and to concurrent deposition of atoms of species @xmath3 .",
    "we will make several assumptions that are motivated by the experiments of moon _",
    " for example , we will assume @xmath3 and @xmath2 do not react chemically to form a stable compound .",
    "however , a number of the parameters in the theory are not currently known for a silicon target with gold co - deposition . in some cases",
    ", we will make simplifying assumptions about these parameters that may or may not be valid for the experiments of moon _",
    "our goal is to demonstrate in the simplest possible context that the phenomena observed by moon _",
    "_ can arise from the existing theory once it has been suitably modified , not to produce a theory that quantitatively reproduces all of their measurements .",
