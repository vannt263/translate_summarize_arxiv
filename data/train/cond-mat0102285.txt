    "the competition of interactions on different length scales is one of the mechanisms able to stabilize mesoscale phase separations and create spatial inhomogeneities in a wide variety of systems .",
    "the most typical situation is a competition between short - ranged forces , that favors the formation of a uniform condensed phase , and the long - range forces which can energetically frustrate this condensation .",
    "classical examples are the formation of domains in magnetic multilayer compounds@xcite , mesoscopic structures built by assembling polymers in solution or amphiphiles in  water - oil mixtures @xcite.very often , these systems exhibit a long time dynamics similar to the relaxation seen in glasses .",
    "conversely , many proposals have been made that the glassy behavior of molecular liquids might arise from frustration of specific crystalline - like orders incompatible with global packing , e.g. , icosahedral order in dense liquids @xcite .",
    "the observation of complex orbital and charge patterns in cmr - manganites or of charge stripes in doped nickelates and cuprates@xcite suggests that a similar competition causes inhomogeneous structures in these strongly correlated electron systems@xcite .",
    "this point of view is supported by the observation of spatial  inhomogeneities@xcite as well as slow , activated glassy dynamics@xcite , as seen in recent nmr experiments .  upon cooling ,",
    "the cu - nmr signal in @xmath0 based systems disappears ( is `` wiped out '' ) .",
    "this has been interpreted in terms of an electronic relaxation slower than the larmor precession of the nuclear spins@xcite . as a result",
    ", the nmr signal decays so fast that it simply can not be detected anymore .",
    "thus the `` wipe out effect '' discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite is clear evidence for a dramatic increase of the relaxation times of the electronic system .",
    "similarly , la - nmr was used to directly show that there is a glassy activated dynamics with a maximum of @xmath1 , separating relaxational dynamics which is slower than the nuclear lamor frequency at low temperatures from faster processes at higher @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the typical activation energies of these dynamical processes have been analyzed by curro et al.@xcite who made the surprising observation that they are rather independent of the specific details of added impurities etc .",
    "also , the width of the distribution of activation energies is comparable to its mean value in systems with rather different chemical composition . in view of this striking universality of the anomalous long time relaxation in doped mott insulators",
    ", we recently suggested that glassiness in these systems is _ self generated _ , i.e. , _  _ it does not rely on the presence of quenched disorder@xcite .",
    "the latter may , in general , further stabilize a glassy state .",
    "this is supported by molecular dynamics calculations for charge ordering in transition metal oxides , which found an anomalous long time relaxation with a power spectrum similar to @xmath3-noise @xcite .",
    "in addition , recently markiewicz _",
    "et al._@xcite _  _ analyzed neutron diffraction@xcite , nqr@xcite , @xmath4sr@xcite , anelastic relaxation@xcite and susceptibility measurements @xcite , spanning altogether more than 10 orders of magnitude of frequency , and also find a  universal  behavior of the activation energies in underdoped cuprates .",
    "they also find a good description of the relaxational dynamics using a vogel - fulcher law which we predicted based on a entropic droplet argument@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we showed that the competition between interactions on different length scales causes the emergence of an exponentially large number of metastable states ( with the system size ) .",
    "this is generally considered as a condition for the anomalous dynamical features of glassiness , like aging , memory effects and ergodicity breaking .",
    "it is also the heart of the _ random first order transition _",
    "scenario@xcite for vitrification of molecular liquids , originally motivated by the similarities between density functional theories of aperiodic crystals@xcite and the mean field theories for random spin - glasses .",
    "this scenario is now believed to apply to a much more general class of systems .",
    "our result was obtained using a new replica approach,@xcite and by solving the resulting many body problem numerically within the self consistent screening approximation . in this paper",
    "we develop an analytical approach which enables us to identify the underlying physical mechanism for glassiness in a uniformly frustrated system .",
    "we furthermore discuss that our results can also be obtained within a dynamical approach , where glassiness is associated with an unconventional long time limit of the charge correlation function .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the model we investigate and summarize the main results of this paper .",
    "the details of our approach are presented in section iv , subsequent to our summary of the aspects of the stripe liquid state that will be important for our results in section iii .",
    "in section v we conclude and give a list of further open questions .",
    "this paper develops an analytical approach to glassiness in a uniformly frustrated system . by uniformly frustrated we mean that there is a competition of interactions on different length scales and there are no explicitly quenched degrees of freedom , like the ones caused by additional defects or imperfections .",
    "we study a model with local tendency towards phase separation , frustrated by a long range interaction , which , as we will show , has all necessary features to exhibit a glass transition and yet is simple enough to be treated analytically . in the context of cuprate systems",
    "the model has been proposed by emery and kivelson@xcite and is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 characterizes charge degrees of freedom , with @xmath7 in  a hole - rich region , @xmath8 in a hole poor region , and @xmath9 if the local density equals the averaged one . if  @xmath10 the system tends to phase separate since we have to guarantee charge neutrality@xmath11 .",
    "the coupling constant , @xmath12 , is a measure for the frustration between this short range coupling and the long range coulomb interaction . for @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "we expect at low temperatures long range charge ordering .",
    "the ordering temperature can be estimated within mean field theory as @xmath15 , with momentum cut off @xmath16 of the order of an inverse lattice constant . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , within a large @xmath17 approach ( where @xmath18 is generalized to an @xmath17-component field ) , for all @xmath19 , the coulomb interaction suppresses this ordered state at finite @xmath2 . instead , as revealed by a mean field analysis of eq.[ham11 ] where @xmath20 , the system undergoes several crossovers .",
    "as can be seen in fig.[fig1 ] , at high @xmath2 two characteristic length scales occur .",
    "one is the charge ordering correlation length , @xmath21 , and the other , @xmath22 , is the effective debye screening length@xmath23of charged regions of size @xmath21 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "here we can already recognize the effect of the competition between the short - range ordering interaction and the long - range coulomb interaction : the charge density is homogeneous within regions of size @xmath21 , but behaves like a plasma with screening length @xmath24 on larger scales .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was argued that the emergence of the screening length @xmath25 supports the formation of compact ordered domains of size @xmath25 which then give rise to a slow motion and thus glassiness .",
    "how such debye screening should cause such compact domains and glassiness has not been made explicit , however .",
    "our replica approach gives no indication for glassiness in the temperature regime where the debye screening theory applies .",
    "thus , despite using the same hamiltonian , the stripe glass phase discussed in this paper is qualitatively different from the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite . a more detailed discussion of these aspects is given in appendix c.    as the temperature is lowered",
    ", @xmath21  increases monotonically while @xmath25 decreases until it becomes of the order of @xmath21 . at this point ,",
    "the debye screening approximation breaks down and the system crosses over to a new regime characterized by spatial charge modulations , called stripes , with period @xmath26 and coherence length @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these modulations are particularly relevant at low temperatures where the correlation length @xmath21 is larger than the inter - stripe distance @xmath27 and , as we will show , where the _ stripe glass _ phase  emerges .",
    "the charge correlation function @xmath28 of the liquid state at low temperatures is then characterized by two length scales , @xmath27 and @xmath21 .",
    "after transformation into momentum space , this function obeys the following scaling behavior ( neglecting effects due to anomalous powers ) : @xmath29 with @xmath30 peaked at the modulation wave vector @xmath31 with broadening @xmath32 .  in thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "the model , eq.[ham11 ] undergoes a stripe liquid - stripe solid transition at some temperature @xmath33 . within a spherical approximation@xcite or a large-@xmath17 approximation @xcite ,",
    "the transition is of second order and @xmath34 ( unless one takes additional lattice corrections into account which yield a finite @xmath33@xcite ) . in the ising limit ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "@xmath36 and there are indications that the transition is driven first order by fluctuations@xcite .",
    "our results indicate that this phase transition may not be reached kinematically in which case the system undergoes a glass transition instead .",
    "in fact , according to our theory , glassiness emerges if the inter - stripe correlations in the stripe liquid phase are sufficiently strong ; specifically if the ratio @xmath37 is larger than a critical value which we find to be close to @xmath38 .",
    "the temperature , @xmath39 , where this happens , within large-@xmath17 approximation of eq.[ham11 ] , is given by @xmath40 which decreases for increasing frustration parameter @xmath12 .",
    "note that the criterion @xmath41 for glassiness is likely to be much more general than the specific formula for @xmath39 , which depends on details of the model .",
    "also , in a more realistic model , the stripe liquid - stripe solid transition is expected to be of first order due to an additional term @xmath42 in eq.[ham11 ] which exists if particle hole symmetry is broken .",
    "nevertheless , our results do not depend on an actual divergence of @xmath21 but solely that it is larger than a few inter - stripe separations .",
    "therefore , our theory also applies if the transition is only moderately first order and the stripe solid does not occurs unless @xmath43 .  in this case , the equilibrium transition is avoided and a glassy state results .",
    "our theory yields that below @xmath44 the system establishes an exponentially large number of metastable states and long time correlations , characterized by the correlation function @xmath45 .",
    "these long time correlations occur even though no state with actual long range order exists .",
    "even more interestingly , long time correlations with @xmath46 are unambiguously tied to a new length scale , @xmath47 , which characterizes the typical length over which defects and imperfections in the stripe pattern are allowed to wander over long times .",
    "this length can be associated with the allowed vibrational motions in a potential minima of the complex energy landscape of the system . in analogy with structural glasses we therefore call it the lindemann length of the stripe glass .",
    "evidently , in the liquid state @xmath47 is infinite . in the glassy state",
    "we find that @xmath47 jumps discontinuously to a finite value @xmath48 and continuously decreases at lower temperature .",
    "the discontinuous jump in @xmath47 , unaccompanied by a latent heat , indicates the transition is of the random first order type@xcite , i.e. , has one step replica symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , the glassy state is stable only if the slow motion of glassy textures is confined to a range smaller than @xmath49 ( justifying our term lindemann - length ) . due to this additional length scale the following scaling behavior of the long time correlations results : @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 from eq.[gf_liquid ] .",
    "0.75 cm    in fig.[fig2 ] we show the momentum dependence of @xmath53 in comparison with @xmath30 .",
    "close to @xmath54 ( if @xmath55 ) we have @xmath56 @xmath57 .",
    "configurations which are close to perfect stripe arrangements are solely characterized by a momentum independent debye - waller factor , such that @xmath56 @xmath58 . on the other hand , if @xmath59 long time correlations are much reduced compared to instantaneous correlations with @xmath56 @xmath60 .",
    "these ` tails ' of the correlation functions are obviously built up by configurations with defects and imperfections of the perfect stripe arrangement .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 has to be interpreted as the length scale over which defects of the stripe pattern are allowed to wander after a long time .",
    "the glassy state can only be supported if @xmath61 , it melts if defects are allowed to wander too far .",
    "glassiness , including a viscous , energy - landscape dominated long time relaxation , sets in due to the occurrence of exponentially many metastable states @xmath62.@xcite we find that the configurational entropy , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the volume of the system .",
    "the shorter the modulation length , the larger is the number of possible metastable states , which is plausible for simple geometrical reasons .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that locally the stripe correlations stay intact in all these configurations .",
    "furthermore , it is the packing of stripes with different orientation and the arrangement of defects that distinguishes the many different metastable states .    in the laboratory",
    ", the system will freeze into a glass , at some temperature @xmath65 which depends on the cooling rate . while this glass transition is purely dynamical and distinct from a conventional phase transition , a key feature of the ideal glass transition scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the slowing arises from proximity to an underlying random first order transition at @xmath66 , where the configurational entropy vanishes like @xmath67 .",
    "our theory gives exactly this behavior with @xmath68 we find @xmath69 which vanishes linearly at a temperature @xmath70 . below @xmath70",
    "the system freezes into an amorphous solid state due to this ` entropy crisis'@xcite , even for an infinitely slow cooling rate .",
    "usually , the reason for the system to prefer the liquid state over the solid is entropic . if @xmath71 there is no entropic advantage anymore to be in the liquid state and the amorphous solid results , even in equilibrium .    freezing into a glassy state below @xmath39",
    "implies that within our replica approach the barriers between different metastable states are infinite .",
    "this however is a consequence of the mean field character of the replica technique .",
    "following ref.@xcite we argue that the formation of a mosaic pattern with dynamically defined droplets of size @xmath72 of different metastable states will occur .",
    "entropy driven transitions between different states lead to dynamical processes with relaxation time obeying a vogel - fulcher law : @xmath73 with fragility @xmath74 determined by the configurational entropy as well as the bare surface tension of entropic droplets @xmath75 .",
    "finally , a simple estimate for @xmath76 , based on a variational argument , gives @xmath77 to a good approximation .",
    "this was recently found in numerical simulations of the lattice version of eq.[ham11 ] by grousson _",
    "@xcite    recently , markiewicz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite _",
    "_ analyzed various experiments performed on @xmath78 , spanning altogether 13 orders of magnitude of frequency , and also found a ",
    "universal  behavior of the activation energies in underdoped cuprates .",
    "interestingly , a good description of the relaxational dynamics using a vogel - fulcher law , eq.[vfl ] , is possible .",
    "the analysis  of ref.@xcite also yields that @xmath79 decreases with increasing doping concentration @xmath80 . using the relation , @xmath81,@xcite between inter - stripe distance , @xmath27 , and the doping concentration , as well as @xmath82  enables us to determine the doping dependence of @xmath70 and",
    "show that it is properly described within our theory .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig3 ] in comparison with the results as deduced from experiment in ref .",
    "indeed , our theory gives the proper doping dependence of @xmath70 .",
    "if we neglect the differences between @xmath70 and @xmath83 , ( see inset of fig.[fig4 ] below ) , an approximate formula for the doping dependence of @xmath70 is : @xmath84 .",
    "the typical doping concentration on which changes in the glass transition temperature occur is @xmath85 .",
    "note that the experiments analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite are solely sensitive to the spin excitations of the system .",
    "we argue that due to strong coupling between charge and spin degrees of freedom ( which is evident from the formation of phase or anti - phase domain walls ) , glassiness of the charge density causes the observed anomalous long time dynamics in the spin channel .",
    "in this section we summarize the main results for the stripe liquid state needed  for our subsequent calculations in the glass state .",
    "we will mostly use results obtained within a the leading contribution of a @xmath86 expansion .",
    "we calculate higher @xmath86 corrections and show that they are small in the low temperature regime discussed here .",
    "note also that the numerical solution presented in ref.@xcite did take higher @xmath86 corrections systematically into account .",
    "the agreement between the results of this chapter with these numerical results also supports the neglect of @xmath86 corrections for the stripe liquid state .",
    "the latter will become essential , however , in the glass state .",
    "the mean field equations of the stripe liquid including @xmath86 corrections have been discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",

    "we will mostly discuss the low temperature regime where the correlation length , @xmath21 , exceeds the modulation length , @xmath27 , of the system .",

    "unless @xmath21 becomes larger than @xmath27 no actual stripe correlations emerge .",

    "the temperature dependence of @xmath114 is determined by @xmath115 for the case without frustration , @xmath13 , the usual critical temperature @xmath116 results from the requirement @xmath117 . however , for finite @xmath12 no finite transition temperature occurs within the large-@xmath17 approximation .",

    "eq.[r_mf ] we find at low temperatures @xmath125 where in the last step @xmath126 was assumed .",
    "this relationship will be useful for the determination of the temperature , @xmath39 , where glassiness sets in .",
    "with few exceptions@xcite , the analytical investigation of glassiness due to the emergence of a large number of metastable states has concentrated on systems with quenched randomness .",

    "@xcite , where a new replica approach , equally applicable to quenched random and nonrandom systems , was developed . within this approach ,",
    "the configurational entropy for models of structural glasses was  calculated , in good agreement with computer simulations.@xcite here , we use this approach to investigate the physics of self - generated stripe glasses .",
    "the equilibrium s free energy density is given as @xmath127 .",
    "it is of relevance only if the system is kinetically able to explore the entire phase space .",
    "alternatively , one can introduce the averaged typical free energy of a system using the following recipe of an `` ergodicity breaking field''@xcite .",

    "it is then argued that there is a relaxation rate @xmath390 due to the reorganization of domains which  obeys an arrhenius form @xmath391 where @xmath392 is the activation energy of the domain .",
    "finally , it is asserted that the divergence in the viscosity of the system at low temperatures is determined by @xmath393 .",
    "we disagree with this picture .",
    "as shown below , the scale @xmath394 , which signals the relevance of the long range interaction , can easily be identified as the debye screening length of charged particles of size @xmath21 with the expected charge density .",
    "even when the debye picture applies , we find it hard to understand how conventional screening can lead to a dynamics which is dominated by the activated reorganization of screening clouds and where the natural langevin description gives a fast relaxation .",
    "when @xmath395 there are many short wavelength excitations of weakly coupled charges and the system should rather behave as a high temperature plasma than as a glass .",
    "in addition , for @xmath396 it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that debye screening occurs only at temperatures @xmath397 . at low temperatures modulated structures result which lead to the formation of well correlated stripes as @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath398 does not exhibit a maximum at a temperature comparable to @xmath240 but keeps growing until either a stripe solid or a stripe glass is formed .",
    "we now show that the scale @xmath387 is the debye screening length of charged particles of size @xmath21 .",
    "we perform a coarse graining of the system into regions of linear size @xmath21 centered around positions @xmath399 .",
    "then eq.[ham11 ] becomes : @xmath400 where @xmath401 and charges @xmath402 in the last step we assumed that within the volume @xmath403 the system is essentially ordered and used @xmath404 , with the critical exponents @xmath405 and @xmath406 , obtained within the large @xmath17 approximation , for @xmath407 .",
    "@xcite    the usual analysis of eq.[grain ] within the debye approximation , i.e. solving the poisson equation with induced charges distributed with boltzmann weight , gives the debye screening length : @xmath408 where @xmath409 is the density of charges , here given by @xmath410 .",
    "this finally gives @xmath411 which is precisely the length @xmath394 proposed on ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "it is unclear why debye screening should cause a break up of the system into ordered domains of size @xmath412 ( remember @xmath413 )  and a slow activated dynamics of such domains , necessary to obtain large viscosities .",
    "second , for the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite to work , one also has to assume that the correlation length decreases at low temperature and that debye theory still applies .",
    "the actual analysis of eq.[ham11 ] for @xmath396 does not show both assumptions to be justified@xcite . however , it is interesting that for @xmath414 the emergence of a josephson length scale at low temperatures@xcite might give rise to a competition of physics on two distinct length scales which then , in principle , could lead to a new long time relaxation along the lines of the frustration limited domain approach.@xcite it is interesting to explore the relationship of this scenario to our replica based theory .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that the entropic droplets discussed in this paper are qualitatively different from the domains introduced in the approach of ref . @xcite . whereas the latter correspond to thermodynamically stable configurations , similar to domains in ferromagnets caused by the long ranged dipole - dipole interaction , our entropic droplet are formed by the various metastable states .",
    "transitions between different droplets are caused by a gain  of entropy of a system in what would be an otherwise frozen nonequilibrium state .",
