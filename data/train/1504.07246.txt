    "almost four decades after revealing evidences for dark matter in galaxies @xcite , its nature is still unknown",
    ". dark matter can be smoothly distributed , e.g. the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , or in compact form . since dark matter",
    "does not emit light , the best way to study it is through gravitational interaction .",
    "was the first to conceive the idea of gravitational microlensing as a method to detect massive compact halo dark matter ( macho ) . based on his calculation , the optical depth ,",
    "i.e. at any time the probability of a source to be closer along the line of sight to a foreground lens than the lens einstein angle therefore to be magnified by more than 1.34 , is of order 10@xmath3 towards magellanic clouds .",
    "this has motivated several campaigns to search for microlensing towards dense stellar fields , see e.g. the review by @xcite .",
    "the first microlensing events were reported by the _ macho _",
    "@xcite , _ eros _",
    "@xcite , and _ ogle _ @xcite teams , with _ moa _",
    "@xcite joining later on . in their 5.7-year survey data ,",
    "the _ macho _ team has announced 13 microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud @xcite , while a later analysis @xcite showed that 1 of them is a true variable star and 2 of them are likely to be variables from a simple likelihood analysis .",
    "this leaves 10 of them to be plausible microlensing events , and gives a macho halo fraction of 16% for macho masses between 0.1 - 1 m@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the _ eros-1 _ and _ eros-2 _ surveys resulted in a macho halo fraction of less than 8% for macho mass @xmath5 0.4 m@xmath4 , and ruled out machos with masses between 0.6@xmath610@xmath7 and 15 m@xmath4 as a major component of the milky way halo . analyzing the _ ogle _ phase ii and iii data , wyrzykowski et al .",
    "( 2010,2011a,2011b ) concluded that microlensing events towards the large and small magellanic cloud can be reconciled with self - lensing by stars alone , i.e. without requiring compact halo objects in the milky way halo .",
    "later on , @xcite studied the tidal streams between the magellanic clouds and used theoretical modeling to show that the microlensing signal can be reproduced by the stars in the stream , though their modeling requires further verification . @xcite outlined several observational tests to verify their theoretical modeling , e.g. the sources of the microlensing events are low - metallicity smc stars , the sources have high velocities relative to the lmc disk stars , and the presence of a very faint stellar counterpart to the magellanic stream and bridge ( surface brightness @xmath8 34 mag / arcsec@xmath9 in v - band ) .",
    "in contrast to this , @xcite recently re - analyzed the _ ogle _ and _ eros _ data and found that some of the _ ogle _ events can be attributed to halo lensing .",
    "the inconclusive results can be partially attributed to the fact that , by monitoring the magellanic clouds we can only sample a small fraction of the milky way halo . in order to have a census of the milky way halo , we need targets that are distributed along different lines - of - sights through the milky way halo .",
    "other than the milky way , we could monitor a nearby spiral galaxy , for which we can have a complete view of its dark halo .",
    "an alternative dense stellar target for a microlensing search for machos is m31 , as proposed by several authors .",
    "the advantage of m31 is twofold .",
    "first , we can have multiple lines - of - sight through a dark halo towards m31 , in contrast to the single line - of - sight towards the magellanic clouds due to our location in the milky way .",
    "the second advantage is that one does not only probe the milky way halo , but also that of m31 .",
    "the structure of m31 is well known : with an inclination angle of 77@xmath10 , we expect to see an asymmetry of the microlensing event rate between the near- and far - side of m31 disk",
    ". such an asymmetry can however also originate from extinction along different sight - lines caused by dust .",
    "this has indeed been observed in the density distribution of variables from the point - agape survey @xcite and from the wecapp . to be able to account for this dust effect",
    ", we have studied the dust properties of m31 and derived an extinction map across the disk of m31 , which can be used for quantifying detection efficiencies .",
    "microlensing in m31 differs from the magellanic clouds , because at the distance of m31 ( 770 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of the sources for possible microlensing events are not resolved , and each pixel of a ccd image contains up to hundreds of stars .",
    "instead of monitoring individual resolved stars , one has to monitor pixel light curves and their variations towards dense stellar fields .",
    "the sources of microlensing events are usually not resolved before and after the high magnification phases and their `` baseline fluxes '' are thus unknown . in most cases",
    "the magnified source ( at least at maximum magnification ) appears as a resolved object .",
    "however , in order to achieve exquisite photometry in such crowded fields , we thus perform difference image analysis and search for microlensing events at the position of each individual pixel . in order to extract light curves at the position of each individual pixel",
    ", we use a psf constructed from resolved sources in the image to perform psf photometry and obtain pixel light curves .",
    "the theoretical aspect of pixel lensing has been laid down by @xcite under small impact parameter assumption .",
    "@xcite reformulated this theory in a more general context .",
    "the first microlensing events towards m31 were reported by the vatt / columbia microlensing survey .",
    "they put the idea of @xcite into practice @xcite and presented 6 microlensing events discovered by the joint observations of the vatican advanced technology telescope ( vatt ) and the kpno 4 m telescope taken during 1994 and 1995 @xcite .",
    "their observations continued from 1997 to 1999 , with the vatt and the 1.3 m telescope at the mdm observatory . with additional data from the isaac newton telescope , they presented 4 probable microlensing events out of their 3 year data @xcite . at the same time , also launched the andromeda gravitational amplification pixel experiment ( agape ) ; they observed m31 with the 2 m telescope bernard lyot ( tbl ) in the french pyrenees in 1994 and 1995 , which led to the discovery of one bright , short microlensing event . following agape ,",
    "the pixel - lensing observations with the isaac newton telescope - andromeda galaxy amplified pixels experiment ( point - agape ) has monitored m31 from 1999 to 2001 ; their first microlensing event was announced in @xcite , accompanied by three more in ; another 3 were reported by with additional data from the 1.3 m telescope at the mdm observatory in 1998 - 1999 .",
    "the full point - agape data were analyzed with 3 different pipelines based at cambridge , zrich , and london , where 3 @xcite , 6 , and 10 events @xcite were reported by the different nodes , respectively .    using the same int data ,",
    "the microlensing exploration of the galaxy and andromeda ( mega ) survey has presented 14 events . at the same time , the nainital microlensing survey employed the 1.04 m sampurnanand telescope in india to observe from september 1998 until february 2002 .",
    "they have extracted 1 microlensing event from the 4-year data .",
    "more recently , the pixel lensing andromeda collaboration ( plan ) carried out observations using the 1.5 m loiano telescope located in italy and reported 2 events in their data collected in 2007 @xcite .",
    "they further incorporated observations from the 2 m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) taken in 2010 and reported another event @xcite . in the mean time , the pan - starrs 1 collaboration conducted a high - cadence , long - term andromeda monitoring campaign ( pandromeda ) utilizing its wide - field ( @xmath5 7 deg@xmath9 ) camera . based on its first year data , @xcite have reported 6 events in the central 40@xmath640  area , with the promises to detect more events taking advantage of the larger survey area and higher cadence from pan - starrs 1 .",
    "it is worth to note that previous m31 microlensing event identifications may suffer from contaminations by variables .",
    "for example , @xcite suspected that part of their events are contaminated by long - period red supergiant variables . despite the efforts of various campaigns , the macho fraction at the mass range of 0.1 - 1@xmath11 is still under debate ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "for example , the point - agape collaboration has reported evidence for macho signal , while the mega collaboration on the contrary concluded that their events can be fully explained by self - lensing .",
    "due to the small number of reported events , the origin of m31 microlensing remains an open issue . in this study",
    ", we aim to increase the number of microlensing detections and suppress contaminations by variables with long - term observations of the m31 bulge .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec.obs ]",
    "we present the observations of our long - term survey .",
    "our data reduction is outlined in section [ sec.red ] , followed by the event detection in section [ sec.det ] . the analysis of these events are shown in section [ sec.ana ] .",
    "a discussion of our events , as well as results from previous m31 microlensing surveys are presented in section [ sec.dis ] , with a summary and prospects in section [ sec.sum ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     in this section we summarize m31 microlensing events from previous surveys we are aware of and we compare our 12 events with previous studies .",
    "table [ tab.events_overview ] lists the project name , number of detected events , their label and color as used in figures [ fig.events_tfwhm_distribution ] and [ fig.events_positions ] , and the references for the events . in the 2@xmath12 column",
    "we report the number of events that were solely detected by the corresponding survey . in the 3@xmath13 column we list the number of events that were detected by more than one groups .",
    "for example , paulin - henriksson et al . ( 2003 ) published 4 events from the point - agape project , where 2 of them were only detected by point - agape , and 2 of them were also detected by other projects . altogether",
    "56 different m31 microlensing events have been published to date ( including those presented in this work ) .",
    "their @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.events_tfwhm_distribution ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig.events_positions ] we show the positions of microlensing events in a 50@xmath670 arcmin@xmath9 field from the 2@xmath12 palomar sky survey .                the first fact to note in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.events_tfwhm_distribution ] is that wecapp ( red ) , point - agape ( blue ) , and plan ( yellow ) surveys detected very short timescale events and hardly any events with @xmath17 15 days . in contrast , the first events ever announced by vatt / columbia ( * ? ? ? * marked in violet color in fig .",
    "[ fig.events_tfwhm_distribution ] ) have very long timescales ( 5 of 6 events have @xmath18 65 days ) . in the same paper @xcite suspected that part of their events may be caused by long period variables .",
    "the mega ( green ) and belokurov l2 ( cyan ) events show an almost flat timescale distribution .",
    "five of the mega events are ( in de - projection ) located in the disk , almost at the same distance with respect to the m31 center .",
    "this makes them more suspicious , since they could be intrinsic varying disk stars that exist in a particular evolutionary time scale , that is overrepresented at this particular radius within the disk .",
    "predicting event rates and their characteristics from the theoretical studies , riffeser et al .",
    "( 2008 ) from their m31 microlensing model show the expected event rate of long timescale events ( @xmath17 30 days ) is an order of magnitude smaller than the event rate of short timescale events ( @xmath19 10 days ) , see e.g. their fig .",
    "the fact that the vast majority of the events presented in this paper are short timescale events is therefore in good agreement with expectations .",
    "in contrast , vatt / columbin and mega surveys show an almost flat timescale distribution . unless surveys analyzed by mega and belokurov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have detection efficiencies that strongly suppress events with timescales @xmath20 10 days , they should have detected more short timescale microlensing .",
    "an alternative and more plausible explanation is that a large fraction of these long events are indeed long period variables , but were not ruled out from the microlensing candidate light curves due to the relative short time - span of the survey .    the vatt / columbia team uses their observations in the 1994 - 1995 season to rule out objects of masses in the range of 0.003 - 0.08@xmath11 as the primary constituents of the mass of m31 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find 4 probable microlensing events with data collected between 1997 and 1999 .",
    "they conclude that 29@xmath21% of the halo masses are composed by machos assuming a nearly singular isothermal sphere model .",
    "they also provide a poorly constrained lensing component mass ( 0.02 - 1.5 @xmath11 at 1@xmath22 limits ) .",
    "present an analysis of the point - agape data .",
    "they indicate that their microlensing event rate is much larger than self - lensing expectation alone .",
    "this leads to a lower limit of 20% of the halo mass in the form of machos with mass between 0.5 - 1 @xmath11 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the lower limit drops to 8% for machos @xmath5 0.01 @xmath11 .    on the contrary ,",
    "the mega team conclude that their 14 events are consistent with self - lensing prediction .",
    "this rules out a macho halo fraction larger than 30% at the 95% confidence level .",
    "however , recent studies by show that , when compared with the timescales , maximum fluxes , and spatial distributions from monte - carlo simulations , the mega events can not be fully explained by self - lensing alone .    the evidence for machos can be inferred from individual events provided good sampling of the light curves .",
    "for example , the wecapp - gl1/point - agape - s3 event was independently discovered by the point - agape and the wecapp @xcite collaboration .",
    "joint analysis of the light curves from these two collaborations has led to the conclusion that this event is very unlikely to be a self - lensing event @xcite .",
    "this is because with a realistic model of the three - dimensional light distribution , stellar population and extinction of m31 , an self - lensing event with the parameters of wecapp - gl1/point - agape - s3 is only expected to occur every 49 years .",
    "in contrast , a halo lensing event ( with 20% of the m31 halo consists of 1 m@xmath23 machos ) would occur every 10 years .",
    "in addition , combining the data from plan and wecapp , @xcite have revealed the finite - source effect in the event oab - n2 .",
    "@xcite then used the finite - source effect to determine the size of the einstein ring radius , and combined the einstein ring radius with the time required for the lens to travel the einstein ring radius ( @xmath24 ) to derive the lens proper motion .",
    "hence they were able to put a strong lower limit on the lens proper motion . since the lens proper motion in the halo lensing scenario is different ( and much larger ) than the self - lensing scenario ( see e.g. fig .",
    "4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their result thus favors the macho lensing scenario over self - lensing for this event .    to conclude , some statistical studies and individual microlensing events point to a non - negligible macho population , though the fraction in the halo mass remains uncertain . to pinpoint the macho mass fraction , a better understanding of the luminous population , i.e. self - lensing rate ,",
    "is needed .",
    "determining the macho mass fraction requires precise detection efficiency studies which is beyond the scope of this publication .",
    "we have started such efficiency studies ( koppenhoefer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . by simulating artificial events into the wecapp images we will be able to account for true noise and systematics introduced by the processing and the detection procedure .",
    "the results will enable us to derive a robust estimate of the macho mass fraction using an improved m31 model for disk , bulge and halo .",
    "wecapp has monitored the bulge of m31 for 11 years , which is the longest time - span among m31 microlensing surveys .",
    "we have established an automated selection pipeline and present the final 12 microlensing events from wecapp .",
    "the brightest event of it ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) is hard to reconcile with self - lensing alone , hence hints at the existence of machos in the halo of m31 .",
    "a similar case has been found by calchi novati et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    to gain insights to the macho fraction , in - depth understanding of self - lensing is required , which is only possible with microlensing experiments that monitor both the bulge and the disk of m31 simultaneously . with the advent of pan - starrs 1",
    ", we have conducted a dedicated project monitoring m31 with a field - of - view of @xmath5 7 degree@xmath9 .",
