    "all of these studies allowed stars to be lost into or destroyed by the bh ; however most adopted parameters more suited to globular clusters than to nuclei , e.g. a constant - density core .",
    "@xcite applied the isotropic , multi - mass fokker - planck equation to the evolution of nuclei containing sbhs , including an approximate loss term in the form of ( [ eq : dndt ] ) to model the scattering of low - angular - momentum stars into the sbh .",
    "most of their models had what would now be considered unphysically high densities and the evolution was dominated by physical collisions between stars .",
    "however in two models with lower densities , they reported observing significant expansion over @xmath91 yr ; these models had initial central relaxation times of @xmath198 yr when scaled to real galaxies , similar to the relaxation times near the centers of m32 and the milky way .",
    "the @xmath111 form of the density profile near the sbh was observed to be approximately conserved during the expansion .",
    "@xcite carried out monte - carlo evolutionary calculations of a suite of models containing a mass spectrum , some of which were designed to mimic the galactic center star cluster . after the stellar - mass bhs in their models had segregated to the center , they observed a roughly self - similar expansion .",
    "@xcite followed core collapse in @xmath25-body models with and without a massive central particle ; `` tidal destruction '' was modelled by simply removing stars that came within a certain distance of the massive particle .",
    "when the `` black hole '' was present , the cluster expanded almost from the start and in an approximately self - similar way .",
    "these important studies notwithstanding , there is a crucial need for more work on this problem in order to understand how the rates of processes like stellar tidal disruption vary over cosmological times ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
