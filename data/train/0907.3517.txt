    "manifold with cylindrical ends_.    scattering theory on @xmath7 investigates how wave packets coming in from infinity are scattered in @xmath1 .",
    "the scattering of @xmath0-forms on @xmath7 is described by the scattering matrix @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the laplace - beltrami operator acting on @xmath0-forms on @xmath3 and @xmath13 the eigenspace of @xmath12 with eigenvalue @xmath14 .",
    "in particular for small values of the spectral parameter @xmath15 we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the space of harmonic @xmath0-forms on @xmath3 .",
    "for the purposes of this article one can think of the scattering matrix for small values of the spectral parameter as being defined by the statement of theorem [ main1 ] . in this case",
    "it can be shown that @xmath18 leaves the direct summands invariant and is of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the scattering matrix describing the scattering of coclosed forms . again",
    "@xmath21 can be defined by the statement of theorem [ main2 ] as the matrix relating the incoming and outgoing waves .",
    "the first observation is that the total scattering matrix for coclosed @xmath0-forms at energy @xmath22 , @xmath23 is a self - adjoint involution which anti - commutes with the hodge star operator .",
    "the @xmath24 eigenspace of @xmath25 coincides with the space of harmonic forms that represent cohomology classes in @xmath26 .",

    "it can be calculated from the eisenbud - wigner formula ( see appendix [ app2 ] ) , and for small @xmath15 it is given by @xmath28 of course @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the time delay operator for coclosed forms defined by @xmath31 its value @xmath32 at zero energy is of particular interest and we call it the _ scattering length_. the physical interpretation of the scattering length is as follows .",
    "if a coclosed wave packet has very low energy then , by the uncertainty relation , it will be far spread out .",
    "in particular it will not be able to `` feel '' details of the geometry of @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of the manifold @xmath1 in the scattering process for a wave is then close to that of a cylindrical obstacle of length given by the scattering length .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question to determine what geometric properties of @xmath1 have an effect on the scattering length . since @xmath33 commutes with the hodge star operator it is enough to know its restriction to the @xmath34 eigenspace of @xmath25 .",

    "the physical interpretation of this is as follows . for a wave of low energy the reflection coefficient @xmath59 and the transmission coefficient @xmath60 for a wave coming in at the boundary component @xmath49",
    "are approximated by their values at zero , namely ( see section [ scatterex1 ] ) @xmath61 the time - delay is then determined by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "for example in the case where @xmath64 the reflection coefficient at zero energy is zero and the time delay of the transmitted wave is equal to @xmath65 ( see section [ scatterex1 ] ) .",
    "another example , the full - torus , is treated in section [ scatterex2 ] .",

    "we also investigate how the @xmath69-norm of a class in @xmath70 and the @xmath69-norm of its image in @xmath71 under the connecting homomorphism are related for the manifold with boundary @xmath67 .",
    "there is an operator @xmath72 that relates the @xmath69-norm of classes in the complement of the kernel of the connecting homomorphism to the @xmath69-norm of the image of this class under the connecting homomorphism .",
    "so @xmath72 measures to what extent the connecting homomorphism is a partial isometry .",
    "theorem [ theoremquadratic ] shows that the operator @xmath72 has an expansion of the form @xmath73 as @xmath74 .",
    "this shows that one can calculate the scattering length by approximating @xmath7 by the compact manifolds @xmath67 and consider the constant term in the above expansion .",
    "the exponential decay of the remainder term may also be useful for numerical computations .",

    "we review stationary scattering theory for @xmath0-forms on manifolds with cylindrical ends .",

    "we also derive a cohomological formula for the scattering length . in sections",
    "[ lzweiestimates ] and [ systoles ] it is shown that the @xmath69-scalar products on the cohomology groups of @xmath7 can be estimated in terms of geometric quantities and that these estimates imply estimates on the scattering length .",
    "section [ examples ] treats the case of functions in the case of two boundary components and the case of a full - torus . in this section",
    "we demonstrate how our main result can be used to obtain estimates of the scattering length in terms of geometric data . in appendix [ app2 ]",
    "we discuss the relation between the stationary and the dynamical approach to scattering theory and we establish the eisenbud - wigner formula for manifolds with cylindrical ends .",
    "whereas for the sake of notational simplicity we restricted ourselves in this paper to manifolds with cylindrical ends most of our analysis carries over in a straightforward manner to waveguides if neumann boundary conditions are imposed .",
