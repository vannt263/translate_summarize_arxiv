    "the possible existence of hidden strangeness in the nucleon has recently become one of the most controversial problems in nuclear / hadron physics .",
    "some analyses of the pion - nucleon sigma term @xcite , polarized deep - inelastic lepton - proton scattering @xcite , and low energy elastic neutrino - proton scattering @xcite indicate a significant role of strange sea quarks in the nucleon structure @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been argued that such experimental results could be understood with little or null strangeness in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting , therefore , to study other processes that might be related directly to the strangeness content of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "one of them is @xmath0 meson production from the proton .",
    "since the @xmath0 meson is a nearly pure @xmath1 state because of ideal mixing with the @xmath2 meson , its coupling to the proton is suppressed through the ozi rule .",
    "then the idea is that we could extract information about the hidden strangeness of the nucleon by studying the strange sea quark contribution through the ozi evasion processes .",
    "one example is @xmath0 production in proton  anti - proton annihilation .",
    "recent experiments on vector meson production through @xmath3 annihilation at rest @xcite report a strong violation of the ozi rule .",
    "it can be accounted for by the presence of an intrinsic @xmath4 component in the nucleon wave function @xcite , which contributes to the process through the rearrangement and shake - out diagrams @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was also claimed that this ozi violation could be explained through modified meson exchange models @xcite without any strangeness content of the nucleon .",
    "another possibility is @xmath0 photo- and electro - production from proton targets @xcite . in this process , in addition to the vector - meson dominance model ( vdm ) , the contribution from the hidden strangeness of the proton arises through the direct knockout process . in refs .",
    "@xcite , henley _ et al .",

    "to arrive at this conclusion , they used nonrelativistic quark model wave functions for the hadrons .",
    "however , since the kinematical region of @xmath0 meson production is beyond the applicability of the nonrelativistic quark model , the relativistic corrections are expected to be important . in refs",
    "@xcite we improved the calculations of refs . @xcite with the use of a relativistic harmonic oscillator quark model ( rhoqm ) .",
