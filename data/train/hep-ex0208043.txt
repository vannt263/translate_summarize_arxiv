    "@xmath3gev @xmath4 beams on @xmath5gev protons the centre of mass energy is @xmath6gev which also gives the upper bound on momentum transfer and thus the scale to which proton structure can be probed . apart from extending the study of deep inelastic scattering and partonic physics",
    ", hera also allows @xmath1 interactions to be study over a wide range of photon virtuality down to almost real photons .",
    "it provides a laboratory in which the high energy behaviour of cross - sections may be studied as a function of the transverse size of the projectile .",
    "this is the realm of ` low @xmath0 ' physics .",
    "this brief survey covers : data from h1 and zeus on inclusive and diffractive processes : their analysis using perturbative qcd and other models , particularly colour diople models ; the evidence or otherwise for universality and gluon saturation at low @xmath0 .",
    "inclusive electron  proton scattering at hera @xmath7 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinreg ]  lh . at a fixed centre of mass energy , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ) the process is described by two kinematic variables , @xmath10 , the four - momentum transfer squared and bjorken @xmath0 where q^2=-q^2=-(k - k^)^2 :  x = q^2/(2p.q ) .",
    "the inelasticity , @xmath11 , the fractional energy loss of the electron in the proton rest frame , is related to @xmath0 and @xmath10 by @xmath12 .",
    "the primary measured quantity is the double differential cross - section which , for @xmath13 , may be written in terms of two structure functions = 2 ^ 2xq^4 .",
    "[ eqn : d2xq2 ] the contribution from @xmath14 , the longitudinal structure function , is small and will be ignored in most of what follows .",
    "the inclusive scattering process may also be considered in terms of the total cross - section for @xmath1 scattering . at small @xmath0 ^tot_^*p(w^2,q^2)=4",
    "^ 2q^2f_2(x , q^2 ) ,  and  w^2q^2/x , [ eqn : f2-sig ] where @xmath15 is the centre of mass energy squared of @xmath1 system .",
    "so the structure function at small @xmath0 gives @xmath16 at high cm energies .",
    "the @xmath17 region in which inclusive measurements have been made is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinreg ]  rh . the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath10    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     and a number of formulations have been proposed ( see @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "the version of golec - biernat & wsthoff ( gbw ) @xcite is followed , partly for its simplicity , but also because it builds in the constraint of saturation . in their approach ,",
    "the dipole cross - section is given by _",
    "qq(x , r)=_0 ,   r_0(x)=(x / x_0)^/2 , [ eqn : gbw1 ] where @xmath18 are three parameters to be determined from data . the interesting features of eq .",
    "[ eqn : gbw1 ] are : for small dipole sizes @xmath19 ; for large dipoles @xmath20 and that the parameter @xmath21 setting the scale depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this last feature means that the approach to the ` saturation limit ' occurs for smaller dipole sizes as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "the parameters of the model are fixed by fitting the hera low @xmath0 @xmath22 data .",
    "another very compelling feature of the dipole approach is that diffraction may also be described .",
    "the diffractive cross - section is given by .d^diffr._^*pdt|_t=0=",
    "116d^2dz|(,z)|^2 ^ 2_qq(x , r ) . thus",
    "no new parameters are required beyond those needed to describe the total @xmath1 cross - section .",
    "the successes of this simple model are a reasonable fit to the low @xmath0 and low @xmath10 ( including the transition to the non pqcd region - see fig .",
    "[ fig : diffr+dpol]-rh ) and the energy independence of the ratio @xmath23 @xcite . an obvious deficiency of the model is that it does not contain any mechanism for pqcd @xmath10 evolution of the structure function .",
    "an attempt to remedy this has been made by bartels @xcite , the dipole cross - section for small @xmath24 is modified and related to the gluon density by _",
    "qq(r , x)r^2_sxg(x,^2 ) , where the scale @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a parameter .",
    "the modified model now has 5 parameters to be determined by the @xmath22 data .",
    "the fit to the higher @xmath10 data is improved and @xmath27 ( eq .  [ eqn : lam - def ] ) is well described for all @xmath10 , whereas for the non - evolving model @xmath28 falls below the slope data for @xmath29gev@xmath30 .",
    "the success of the gbw dipole model can not be taken to imply that saturation is _ required _ by the hera data as other models without saturation , e.g. the dipole model of forshaw @xcite , give as good a representation of the data .",
    "hera has provided high precision data on the proton structure function @xmath22 over a wide range of @xmath0 and @xmath10 . in the low @xmath0 region",
    "the bulk of the data is now systematics limit ( typical uncertainties @xmath31% ) .",
    "hera has also provided a wide range of measurements on hard diffractive scattering and quasi - elastic vector meson production . the striking feature of @xmath22 at low @xmath0  the strong rise  is mirrored in diffractive processes when there is a hard scale .",
    "the first measurement of the pion structure function at low @xmath0 shows that it too rises strongly as @xmath0 decreases , which hints at universality in low @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "the behaviour of low @xmath0 @xmath22 , or equivalently high energy @xmath32 , is dominated by gluon dynamics .",
    "although some of the important calculations were completed well before hera started operations , there is no doubt that hera has opened up new avenues in strong interaction physics .",
    "particularly the determination of the gluon density at low @xmath0 , the refinement of high density perturbative gluon dynamics and the deepening of the relationship between diffractive scattering and the physics underlying the rise of total cross - sections with energy .",
    "the hera measurements and the related theoretical developments provide essential input for run ii at the tevatron , rhic and the lhc .",
