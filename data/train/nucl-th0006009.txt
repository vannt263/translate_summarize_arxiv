    "since many years the study of the various collective flows of nuclear matter is one of the main subjects in heavy - ion physics @xcite .",
    "the interest in collective nuclear motion under extreme conditions , like high density and/or high temperature , originates from the fundamental problem to extract the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the in - plane directed flow @xcite is sensitive to both the incompressibility @xmath9 of the eos and to the momentum - dependent effective interaction ( mdi )",
    ". moreover , the in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross section ( that is related to the imaginary part of the in - medium @xmath10-matrix ) also influences the transverse directed flow @xcite since nucleons acquire transverse momentum also by elastic and inelastic collisions .",
    "it is necessary , therefore , to have at least two additional observables , besides the in - plane flow , in order to determine the three most commonly used components of the effective nn interaction adopted in the various analyses : the incompressibility @xmath9 , the stiffness of the mdi and , possibly , the in - medium nn cross section .",
    "the rapidity distribution of nucleons , which is only weakly dependent on the mean - field parameters , gives reasonable constraints on the in - medium nn cross section or on the nuclear stopping power @xcite .",
    "however , it was not so clear until recently , how to possibly extract information on the mdi from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "danielewicz @xcite has shown within the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) transport model , that the elliptic flow ( or squeeze - out ratio ) of protons at midrapidity is very sensitive to the mdi part of the nucleon mean field .",
    "the reaction bi+bi at @xmath11=400 , 700 , 1000 amev ( measured by the kaos collaboration @xcite ) has been analysed in @xcite leading to the conclusion that the mdi part of the nn interaction should produce an effective landau mass @xmath12 , since momentum independent forces ( @xmath13 ) strongly underpredict the squeeze - out ratio at high transverse momenta @xcite .",
    "the aim of our present work is : ( i ) to study the mechanism of the squeeze - out enhancement by the mdi and ( ii ) to analyse several independent data sets on the _ directed _ and _ elliptic _ flow of nucleons to get experimental constraints on the stiffness of the mdi .",
    "we concentrate on the bombarding energy regime up to 2 agev since here multiple meson production or `` string '' degrees of freedom play a minor role . as shown by sahu et al .",
    "@xcite the collective flow is strongly influenced by the effective degrees of freedom taken into account in the transport approach at high energies . for a detailed investigation of this problem  especially at ags energies",

    "the equation of motion for the nucleon phase - space distribution function @xmath14 includes a propagation in the momentum - dependent scalar mean field @xmath15 via the single - particle energy @xmath16 both elastic and inelastic scattering processes are additionally described by the r.h.s . of the transport equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the coulomb potential acting on protons ;",

    "the stiffness @xmath46 of the mdi in the interactions hm and sm is close to that of ref .",

    "a squeeze - out of nucleons is observed experimentally in the beam energy range below 1@xmath592 agev where mean - field effects still play an essential role .",
    "it can be interpreted , however , to a major extent in terms of a shadowing phenomenon @xcite , as in the participant - spectator picture of a heavy - ion collision the fireball particles  emitted in the reaction plane  are rescattered on the spectators .",
    "this results intuitively in a squeeze - out ratio @xmath60 at midrapidity being larger than 1 . here",
    "@xmath61 is the azimuthal distribution of nucleons with respect to the reaction plane in a given rapidity interval .",
    "a specific particle emitted from the center - of - mass of a system and moving in transverse direction with velocity @xmath62 will be shadowed by the spectator piece , if it reaches the spectator during the passage time @xmath63 of the colliding nuclei .",
    "here @xmath64 is the radius of the nuclei ( assummed to be equal for projectile and target ) , @xmath65 is the projectile velocity in the center - of - mass system , and @xmath66 .",
    "a straightforward geometrical estimate then leads to the condition @xmath67 , or @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the impact parameter .",
    "one can see from ( [ shadcond ] ) that at larger impact parameters @xmath69 the lower limit of @xmath62 becomes smaller , i.e. more particles will be shadowed and the squeeze - out ratio @xmath70 will increase ( c.f . later fig .",
    "this is simply related to a larger size ( @xmath71 ) of the spectator pieces in peripheral collisions .",
    "it is also evident , that for faster moving particles it is easier to fulfill the condition ( [ shadcond ] ) and , therefore , the squeeze - out ratio should grow with the particle transverse velocity @xmath62 ( c.f . later",
    "6,13 ) .",
    "the squeeze - out phenomenon can also be characterized by a negative elliptic flow @xmath0 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) which appears in the fourier expansion @xmath72 neglecting thus higher order terms in ( [ fourier ] ) , the following direct relation is obtained : @xmath73 in ( [ fourier ] ) the elliptic flow @xmath0 is given as @xmath74    at higher beam energy ( @xmath75 agev ) , faster moving and lorentz - contracted spectators do not shadow particles any more from the expanding fireball @xcite .",
    "this results in @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) as observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "the simple geometrical picture discussed above will be illustrated by the buu phase - space evolution in the next section . since the squeeze - out is related to the participant - spectator reaction mechanism ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , we expect a lower beam - energy limit of @xmath78 agev for @xmath79 . at even lower beam energies",
    "the mean - field effects lead to the formation of rotating nuclear systems @xcite that emit particles predominantly in the reaction plane due to centrifugal forces , thus producing @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 , c.f .",
    "later fig . 7 ) .",
    "we have to note , however , that the shadowing scenario can not completely explain the squeeze - out phenomenon .",
    "for instance , a small but statistically significant increase of @xmath82 at the beam energy @xmath83 agev ( see later fig .",
    "7 ) with increasing incompressibility @xmath9 can not be understood in the shadowing picture .",
    "this is , probably , a manifestation of a focussing of high momentum particles by the repulsive mean field as proposed in ref .",
    "we study the system au+au at the beam energy @xmath84 agev and impact parameter @xmath85 fm .",
    "2 shows the time evolution of the central baryon density and of the nn collision rate for the hm and sm mean fields . in agreement with fig . 1 ( upper left panel ) , a slightly higher density and , as a consequence",
    ", a higher collision rate are reached in the case of the sm parametrization .",
    "however , the various eos shown in fig . 1 practically do not differ in the density interval @xmath86 @xmath5 probed in the collision .",
    "we do not expect , therefore , to get clear constraints on the incompressibility @xmath9 from our study of _ peripheral _ collisions and concentrate mainly on the mdi - part of the effective interactions .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath87-dependence of the @xmath0 coefficient is very sensitive to the momentum dependence of the nuclear mean field . in order to understand this fact ,",
    "we have performed calculations with the parametrizations h and hm of the mean field .",
    "3 shows the average transverse velocity ( a ) and transverse momentum ( b ) of the midrapidity neutrons moving in- and out- of the reaction plane versus time .",
    "we observe that in the case of the hm parameter set @xmath88 reaches a maximum at @xmath89 fm / c when also the central density and the collision rate are close to the maximum ( fig .",
    "2 ) . at this time",
    "the system shows the most compact configuration in space , i.e. the line connecting the centers of target and projectile spectators , is perpendicular to the beam ( z- ) direction ( fig .",
    "however , in case of the h mean field the transverse velocity has no maximum ( the peaks of @xmath88 and @xmath90 at @xmath91 fm / c are due to fluctuations , because initially there are no nucleons at midrapidity ) .",
    "moreover , at @xmath92 fm / c in the case of the hm mean field the average transverse velocity is larger than for the mean field h , while the transverse momentum is practically independent on the mean field , even showing a slightly opposite tendency : at @xmath92 fm / c the mean field h produces a somewhat larger @xmath90 .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood from the hamiltonian equations : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the single - particle energy ( [ hmf ] ) . for the momentum - independent mean field h , ( [ vel ] )",
    "reduces to a simple proportionality : @xmath95 , where @xmath96 gev .",
    "however , for the hm interaction the strong momentum - dependent mean field @xmath15 is created by the density build - up , and the second term in the r.h.s . of ( [ vel ] )",
    "becomes large ( and positive ) , which results in a larger transverse velocity for hm .",
    "on the other hand , the force acting on a particle depends mostly on the eos produced by a given mean field or on the pressure gradient .",
    "thus , the r.h.s . of ( [ acs ] ) depends relatively weakly on the momentum dependence of a mean field .    later on @xmath88 and @xmath90",
    "decrease reaching asymptotic values at @xmath97 fm / c .",
    "this decrease is due to less energetic products of nn scattering , which populate the midrapidity region at later times , while first - chance collision products have larger kinetic energies .",
    "faster moving particles ( in the case of the hm calculation with respect to h ) are shadowed more effectively , which causes a larger splitting between in- and out - of - plane transverse velocities for the hm calculation at large times .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the final azimuthal angle dependence of the midrapidity neutron transverse velocity ( a ) and the neutron azimuthal distribution ( b ) .",
    "the azimuthal angle modulation of the transverse velocity is clearly visible , which was first observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the transverse velocity azimuthal angle dependence and the azimuthal distribution of particles have the same shape .",
    "the depletion of the particle yield at @xmath98 and @xmath99 is caused by a shadowing of fast moving particles by the spectators ; the enhanced yield at @xmath100 correlates with the nonshadowed emission of fast particles .",
    "6 shows the coefficient @xmath0 vs. transverse velocity ( left panels ) and vs. transverse momentum ( right panels ) at the two time steps @xmath101 fm / c and @xmath102 fm / c . even at 30 fm",
    "/ c the particles still feel the influence of the nuclear field and , therefore , the simple relation @xmath103 can be applied at this moment only in the case of the momentum - independent mean field h. one can see , that at 30 fm / c the @xmath104-dependence is different for different mean fields , while the @xmath105-dependence is very similar for the h and hm calculations .",
    "this is in agreement with our expectation , that particles moving with the same transverse velocity are shadowed in the same way regardless of their transverse momenta . at later times , this `` transient universality '' of @xmath105 is destroyed since the influence of the mean field will become negligible here and @xmath106 for both parameter sets .",
    "in our comparison to data on squeeze - out observables we now compare in parallel also to data on the in - plane flow @xmath1 , which is defined as the derivative of the transverse in - plane momentum component @xmath107 with respect to the normalized c.m .",
    "rapidity @xmath108 at midrapidity @xcite : @xmath109 a simultaneous description of both observables , i.e. @xmath0 and @xmath1 , will give a rather strong confidence that the dynamics of the participant zone and the interaction of the participating nucleons with the spectators are described consistently in our calculation and potentially leading to stringent constraints on the eos and the interactions employed ( see also refs .",

    "the data are taken from refs .",
    "the time evolution has been followed until @xmath111=40 fm / c at @xmath11=2 agev , while at smaller beam energies @xmath111 gradually increases reaching 250 fm / c at @xmath11=25 amev .    the @xmath0 coefficient ( fig .",

    "free protons were selected by the requirement , that the distance to the closest particle within a given parallel ensemble is more than some critical distance @xmath113 fm in order to separate from protons bound in fragments . as discussed in sect .",
    "iii , the elliptic flow @xmath0 vs. @xmath11 shows a nonmonotonic behaviour : it decreases from positive to negative values reaching a minimum at @xmath114 agev , and then it starts to increase moderately again with beam energy . in this work , however , we only concentrate on the beam energy domain below 2 agev and , therefore , the transition from negative to positive @xmath0 at a beam energy @xmath115 agev @xcite is not discussed here . the lower transition energy , i.e. the beam energy at which @xmath0 changes sign , is @xmath116 amev , in agreement with the fopi - data @xcite . the in - plane flow ( figs .",
    "8,9 ) increases monotonically in the beam energy region considered . the balance energy , i.e. the beam energy at which the flow @xmath1 changes sign , is @xmath117 amev in our calculation .",
    "this value is in between the msu - data @xcite ( @xmath118 amev ) and the fopi - data @xcite ( @xmath119 amev ) .",
    "now we discuss the effect of the mean field on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the calculation with a momentum - independent mean field h is in a satisfactory agreement with proton in - plane flow data below 1 agev ( fig .",
    "8) , but it fails to reproduce the strong squeeze - out at @xmath114 agev ( fig .",

    "the lower incompressibility @xmath9 in the sm calculation results in a reduced squeeze - out and a reduced flow with respect to the hm calculation .",
    "generally , the in - plane proton flow and @xmath0 data are best reproduced with the sm mean field .    in fig .",
    "9 we compare to fopi , eos and recent msu-@xmath120 data on the in - plane flow excitation function .",
    "the selected data sets are now for a mixture of protons and complex fragments and , therefore , they exhibit a stronger flow signal ( c.f . fig .",
    "8 , where the data are for protons only ) . a separate study of the fragment flow is out of scope of this work .",

    "9 the results of the buu - sm calculation both for _ all _ ( solid line ) and _ free _ ( dashed line ) protons .",
    "we find a steeper increase of the in - plane flow for _ all _ protons with the beam energy from 0.1 to 1 agev .",
    "the calculation for _ all _ protons is in a good agreement with data at @xmath121 agev , but it underpredicts the flow at lower beam energies , where the _ free _ proton flow @xmath1 increases earlier with @xmath11 and is closer to the data .",
    "this can be explained by the cluster formation scenario from initially _ free _ emitted protons by the momentum ( rather than coordinate ) space coalescence .",

    "the squeeze - out of nuclear matter in heavy - ion collisions at beam energies @xmath147 agev has been studied within the buu approach of ref . @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated , being essentially caused by the shadowing of the expanding fireball by cold spectators , the squeeze - out is quite sensitive to the specific velocity of the particles .",
    "a mean field with a larger mdi stiffness gives a smaller effective mass , and thus a harder velocity spectrum of nucleons . in a heavy - ion collision",

    "the proton in - plane flow data of the eos collaboration at @xmath148 agev and the fragment flow data of the msu-@xmath120 collaboration at @xmath124 amev are consistent with the sm mean field .",
    "we have found , that a reproduction of the berkeley data @xcite on the neutron azimuthal distributions and the in - plane flow in nb+nb and la+la collisions at 400 amev requires an enhanced mdi stiffness for @xmath149 gev / c ( hm1 parameter set : @xmath150 mev and @xmath151 ) . however , the fopi - land data @xcite on the neutron squeeze - out in au+au collisions at 400@xmath59800 amev favour the standard mdi stiffness ( hm or sm parameter sets ) .    to conclude , a simultaneous description of the nucleon squeeze - out @xmath0 and the in - plane flow @xmath1 at the beam energies @xmath152 agev requires a mean field with a strong momentum dependence .",
    "this corresponds to an effective landau mass at the fermi surface @xmath8 at normal nuclear density .",
