    "while mergers between comparable mass galaxies may be responsible for some of the most dramatic extragalactic events , minor mergers with small mass satellites may play a subtle but nonetheless critical role in the evolution of garden  variety spirals , including perhaps the milky way .",
    "it is easy to recognize the fireworks of the former by the tides , starbursts and nuclear activity they trigger .",
    "the latter however may lurk hidden to morphological inspection .",
    "minor mergers are suggested to produce the x  shaped structures seen in some peculiar s0 s ( mihos _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) , the departures from axisymmetry seen in a significant fraction of spiral disks ( zaritsky & rix 1997 ) , the driving mechanism for strong stellar bars ( laine & heller 1999 ) and the peculiar extended counter  rotating disks seen in some early  type spirals , e.g. ngc  7217 ( merrifield & kuijken 1994 ; buta _ et al . _  1995 ) , ngc  3593 ( bertola _ et al . _  1996",
    "; corsini _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) , ngc  3626 ( ciri _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) and ngc  4138 ( jore _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) .",
    "satellites are commonly found in the vicinity of normal galaxies ( zaritsky _ et al . _",
    "if the local group is at all typical of spiral extragalactic environments , then the characteristics of such satellites are familiar .",
    "interaction of the milky way with its low mass satellites is hypothesized to explain a variety of local kinematic peculiarities : the thick disk , the outer flare and warp , the magellanic stream and the high velocity  clouds .",
    "several authors have begun to address numerically the complex phenomenon of minor mergers of gas  rich satellites with more massive spiral companions .",
    "an immediate worry is how to avoid over  heating the inner disk of the primary or disrupting it entirely .",
    "minor mergers of low  density , small mass , gas  rich companions may avoid vertical heating , thereby preserving the victim disk .",
    "predictions of the observable consequences of the accretion of a small mass companion by a spiral include the warping or actual spreading out of the disk ( quinn _ et al . _",
    "as the satellite material sinks towards the center of the large galaxy , the gas , unlike the stars , may lose angular momentum because of dissipation ( hernquist & mihos 1995 )",
    ". the resultant inflow of gas towards the center may trigger a nuclear starburst ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) or fuel nuclear activity ( taniguchi 1999 ) . because of the predicted heating , even a satellite with one tenth the mass will thicken the disk and possibly build  up the bulge , driving the morphology of the post merger primary towards an earlier spiral type .",
    "the discovery of kinematically decoupled disks in early spirals may thus prove the efficacy of minor merger models .",
    "intrinsic galaxy properties arise from two principal components : absolute `` scale '' ( size , luminosity , mass ) and `` form '' ( morphology , bulge  to  disk ratio , color , gas content , star formation rate ) .",
    "it is well - known ( e.g. roberts & haynes 1994 ) that the early spiral types show a much greater spread in their characteristic properties related to `` form '' than do their later ",
    "type counterparts . as a part of a study to investigate the heterogeneity and dark matter content of the sa galaxy class",
    ", we have investigated the kinematics of gas and stars in a sample of morphologically normal , isolated galaxies classified as sa in the _ revised shapley ames catalog _ ( sandage & tammann 1987 ; rsa ) . in the course of that study , we have obtained major and minor axis long slit spectra for both stars and gas for a sample of 20 objects ; for nine of them , we have also obtained  synthesis maps yielding also two ",
    "dimensional  velocity fields .",
    "a summary of results focussing on the data presentation and mass modelling was presented in jore ( 1997 ) .",
    "the analysis of the mass modelling and stellar velocities will be presented elsewhere ( jore _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) .",
    "during the course of that work , a number of unusual cases of kinematic decoupling were discovered . in jore _",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 ) , we discussed the distinctive case of ngc  4138 , an isolated sa with two extended coplanar counter ",
    "rotating stellar disks embedded in a huge hi disk that co  rotates with the secondary stellar component . in a separate paper ( jore _",
    "et al . _  2000",
    ") , we discuss five sa galaxies , ngc  1169 , 3623 , 4866 , 5377 and 5448 , which represent a range of environments and morphologies within the sa class . of those objects ,",
    "ngc  1169 and ngc  5448 , exhibit no peculiar optical kinematics but their outer  disks are strongly warped and kinematically skewed .",
    "ngc  3623 , whose companions in the leo triplet are known to be interacting , exhibits a truncated  disk and central gas decoupling .",
    "ngc  4866 , viewed nearly edge  on , and ngc  5377 show doubling of their central gas components , as well as outer  warps . here , we present four additional examples : ngc 3626 , ngc  3900 , ngc  4772 and ngc  5854 . along with ngc  4138 ,",
    "each of these morphologically normal sa galaxies exhibits peculiar kinematics that betray a disturbed past .",
    "we propose that each represents a different stage and circumstance of involvement in a relatively minor merger event with a gas  rich companion that is no longer recognizable .",
    "this paper presents evidence of this past interaction through a combination of optical imaging and spectroscopy and  synthesis mapping . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the acquisition and reduction of the body of data : broad and narrow  band optical images , optical long  slit spectra , and  synthesis maps .",
    "the kinematic evidence of past interaction is presented for each galaxy in section 3 .",
    "section 4 gives a discussion of the observational results in the context of the minor merger scenario .",
    "the original observing program was designed to provide the details of the galaxy dynamics for the purpose of modelling the dark matter distribution in sa galaxies and , as such , consisted of long  slit major and minor axis spectra of both stars and ionized gas . for a subset , principally gas ",
    "rich objects showing evidence in the optical spectra of kinematic peculiarities ,  synthesis mapping and photometric broad and narrow band imaging was also undertaken .",

    "the stellar velocity profiles along the minor axis show a slight trend that most likely arises because of a small pointing offset .",
    "the weak [ nii ] shows some dispersion but is essentially flat , within the errors ; no other ionized emission is seen .",

    "this value is too small compared to the full rotation width of the galaxy , but is comparable to the velocity spread seen in the [ nii ] in the inner disk .",
    "a simple interpretation of the narrowness of the  profile is that that the  and [ nii ] both arise in a small central disk of r @xmath78 8  that counter  rotates relative to the stars . at the same time , the primary ( stellar ) disk is seen in a post - starburst phase , showing strong balmer absorption throughout . the current gas ",
    "poor state of ngc  5854 may thus be result of the accretion of a relatively dense satellite that has heated the disk and smoothed the spiral structure , leaving only the counter - rotating gas core as evidence of its occurrence .      as mentioned previously , the first object mapped in  with the vla as part of this study was ngc  4138 .",

    "a foreground star is located at a radial distance of 4   from the center along the major axis . as seen in the middle panels of figure 15 , the inner  forms a partial ring , coincident with the h@xmath0  ring , on the north and east , surrounding a central hole . in @xmath31 ,",
    "the galaxy shows a distinctly red bulge ( @xmath31 @xmath42 1.1 ) and a blue ( @xmath31 @xmath42 0.6 ) ring located in the approximate position of the h@xmath0  ring .",
    "the blue ring is particularly strong on the northern and southern portions of the galaxy with breaks in the ring on the east and west .",

    "the relationship of the  gas reported previously by jore _",

    "to the ring and the dustlane is demonstrated here in more detail in figure 15 .",
    "indeed , the relationship of the dustlane and h@xmath0  ring to the  distribution seen in ngc  4138 is very similar to that seen in ngc  3626 ( figure 15 versus figure 5 ) , the other case of large ",
    "scale counter  rotation .",
    "likewise , the  extent is very large , @xmath1 = 2.5 and , as discussed in jore _ et al . _ , the velocity contours along the minor axis suggest a strong warp beyond r@xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to the  distributions seen in ngc  3626 and ngc  4772 , however , the outer hi does not form a distinct and coherent ring , but rather is extremely patchy beyond the optical edge .",
    "ngc  4138 remains the sole example in our sa sample of a galaxy with an extended counter ",
    "rotating stellar component .",
    "nonetheless , it bears similarities to the other objects in terms of its morphological `` boring ",
    "ness '' , relative isolation , large , low surface density  extent , and overall regularity of its velocity field .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a combined imaging and spectroscopic dataset for four sa galaxies ; images are also included for a fifth , ngc  4138 , discussed previously by jore _",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "all of the galaxies show evidence of departure from kinematic normalcy ranging from large ",
    "scale counter  rotation to decoupled central gas and/or stellar components . despite the difference of detail ,",
    "several unifying themes seem critical : ( 1 ) all of the objects are relatively isolated , morphologically normal , unbarred sa galaxies . ( 2 ) rings are prominent features both in the optical broadband light and in the distributions of ionized and neutral gas .",
    "the apparent rings may also result from tightly wound spiral arms viewed at moderate inclination .",

    "when there is no h@xmath0  emission in these regions , the decoupled components often show some form of a color change , often towards the red .",
    "( 4 ) the gas  rich galaxies ( all except ngc  5854 ) contain moderate  masses , but , because the gas is spread over a large area r@xmath47/r@xmath106 2 , the globally averaged  surface densities @xmath107 are very low , typically of order 0.51.0 m@xmath13  pc@xmath75 . in ngc  3626 and ngc  4772 ,",

    "the exterior  is strongly asymmetric .",
    "( 5 ) in all four  maps , including that of ngc  4138 , the velocity field is dominated by circular rotation , but significant departures from motion in a quiescent disk are evident . in all , the outer  velocity contours suggest significant warping of the outer disk , roughly beginning at the optical edge and following briggs ( 1990 ) rule for warps , as commonly seen in other galaxies .",
    "the similiarities found in the five sa galaxies are consistent with the scenario that the kinematically distinct gas components arise from slow , minor mergers of gas  rich satellites with an already  formed disk galaxy .",
    "differences in their appearance thus arise from differences in the circumstances of the merger events .",
    "retrograde primordial gas infall , as discussed by thakar _",

    "although much of this work is preliminary , requiring further refinement of the range of galaxy characteristics and orbital parameters and the influence of gas dissipation , triaxiality and dark matter content , we can nonetheless examine the main characteristics of the five galaxies under the assumption that we may be seeing the results of varying acquisition scenarios .",
    "the extensive  distributions seen in four of the five galaxies discussed here may result from the slow accretion of a gas  rich satellite that is tidally stripped before the merger occurs .",
    "accretion of a low density gas - rich satellite would minimize the disk heating problem and might favor the formation of extended  disks or rings , but perhaps not inner rings .",
    "the formation of rings is seen in a variety of infalling gas models , both due to orbit crowding and to true self  gravitating rings . also , quinn _",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 ) suggest that transport of angular momentum outwards will tend to cause the disk to spread in radius .",
    "the newly  acquired gas may reach sufficient densities , if clumpy , to form a new generation of stars .",
    "this possibility is suggested by the faint , blue , low - surface brightness outer disk seen in ngc  4772 and a similar excess of light found around the counter - rotating sab galaxy ngc  7217 ( buta _ et al . _  1995 ) .",
    "clearly the timescales of the merger events responsible for the individual characteristics noted here are likely to vary greatly .",
    "relatively gas  poor and large  bulged , ngc  5854 may represent the result of the accretion of a more massive satellite travelling in a prograde orbit ( walker _ et al . _",
    "merger events might lead to bulge build  up and even induce large - scale star formation , leaving the galaxy in the post - starburst state in which ngc  5854 is found .",
    "furthermore , one of the primary arguments made against the tidal forcing of warps is that the modes would damp out after a few galactic rotations . perhaps in the cases that suggest strong warping of the",
    ", the minor mergers may be relatively recent events . over time",
    ", the warps may damp , or be reexcited by additional interactions .",
    "if there are no impediments to star formation in a counter - rotating gas component , ngc  4138 with its two counter - rotating extended stellar disks may represented the future evolutionary state of ngc  3626 .",
    "the similarities among the results for these five galaxies lead to several questions and conundrums .",
    "( 1 ) is it key that the sample is composed of sa galaxies ?",
    "the accretion of moderate amounts of gas may also sweep up the gas contained within the primary disk itself , ultimately leading to a smoothing of the spiral structure .",
    "do minor mergers lead to bulge build - up and disk heating , driving the post - merger morphology towards earlier spiral types ?",
    "( 2 ) damping the process of disk heating is a challenge for models of mergers , even minor ones , if the accreted satellite is sufficiently massive or dense .",
    "the resultant disk heating will be relatively lessened if the satellite is predominantly gaseous .",
    "what are the conditions necessary to avoid over - heating the disk and disturbing the overall velocity field and spiral structure ?",
    "( 3 ) is the fact that these galaxies are all unbarred important ?",
    "loss of angular momentum may drive the material inward toward the central regions where it accumulates in a nuclear disk as is often discussed for the kinematically decoupled cores seen in ellipticals . in the early stages of galaxy evolution ,",
    "the formation of bars seems inevitable , but if the central concentration of mass is sufficient , the development of an inner lindblad resonance will inhibit the central flow of gas ( sellwood & moore 1999 ) .",
    "thus , since the progenitor primary was already a well - developed object , infalling material may be stopped at the inner lindblad resonance , allowing the build  up of gas in a ring with subsequent star formation .",
    "does this process produce the inner h@xmath0  and  rings seen here ?",
    "jungwiert & palous ( 1996 ) propose that unbarred ringed galaxies must possess weak central oval distortions , while the two  stream instability picture of lovelace _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1997 ) for galaxies with counter - rotating components suggests the generation of strong m=1 spiral waves .",
    "are the inner kinematic peculiarities evidence of such oval distortions or m=1 streaming ? ( 4 ) although these sa galaxies are relatively isolated , they are all members of loose groups .",
    "in fact , sa galaxies are found typically in denser environments than their later type counterparts . is the relative morphological segregation seen across the spiral sequence related to the likelihood of minor mergers and their increased probability in environments characterized by moderate density and low velocity dispersion ?    while examination of the rate of strongly disturbed galaxies may provide a reliable estimate of the major merger rate ( e.g. keel & wu , 1995 ) , minor mergers may be morphologically hidden , revealed only by the presence of their resultant kinematic peculiarities . because of the ambiguities involved in disentangling the kinematic clues",
    ", it is not possible to trace with any degree of precision the evolutionary history of the multiple stellar and gaseous components evident in these galaxies .",
    "food for thought , however , is the possibility that , over the course of its lifetime , a disk galaxy might undergo multiple minor accretion events with kinematic as well as morphological consequences . in particular , more complicated histories involving multiple minor mergers are likely to produce heterogenous properties , particularly those related to properties of `` form '' .",
    "we suggest that the heterogeneity of the sa class in particular is the outcome of such complicated life histories , the memory of which is signaled only by kinematic clues such as those identified here .",
