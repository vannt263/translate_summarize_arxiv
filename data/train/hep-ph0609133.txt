    "in the baryonic @xmath0 decay the three - body modes dominate over the two - body modes .",
    "furthermore , in the three - body decay , the baryon - antibaryon pair is copiously produced at small invariant mass near the threshold@xcite .",
    "various theoretical ideas@xcite , some kinematical and others dynamical , were proposed for this threshold enhancement .",
    "a simple short - distance ( sd ) argument can explain qualitatively both the dominance of three - body modes and the threshold enhancement of baryon - antibaryon : to produce a baryon and an antibaryon in the two - body decay ( fig .",
    "1a ) , one energetic @xmath5 pair must be emitted back to back by a gluon so that the gluon emitting the @xmath5 pair is highly off mass shell .",
    "the hard off - shell gluon suppresses two - body decay amplitudes by the power of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the four - momentum square transferred through the gluon . in the three - body decay with an additional meson ( fig .",
    "1b ) , a baryon - antibaryon pair can be emitted collinearly against the energetic boson in the final state . in this configuration a quark and an antiquark",
    "are emitted by a gluon nearly in the same direction so that the gluon is close to the mass shell and the short - distance suppression does not occur .",
    "consequently the @xmath3 of small invariant mass is strongly favoured .",
    "in addition to threshold enhancement , the angular correlation was measured between the final proton or antiproton and the boson in some modes , most clearly in @xmath1@xcite .",
    "then an intriguing puzzle@xcite has emerged in the preceding sd picture : in that picture , the antiproton momentum should point more likely to the direction of the @xmath8 momentum in the @xmath3 rest frame of @xmath9 decay .",
    "that is , the proton should tend to move away from @xmath8 in this frame .",
    "the reason is that the antiproton @xmath10 picks up the slow spectator @xmath11-quark and therefore its momentum is smaller on average than that of the proton @xmath12 in the @xmath13 rest frame . by boosting the @xmath13 rest frame to the @xmath3 rest frame ,",
    "we reach this conclusion .",
    "however , the belle collaboration showed exactly the opposite@xcite ; it is the proton that is emitted along @xmath8 in the @xmath3 rest frame .",
    "belle selected the threshold events by making a cut in the @xmath3 invariance mass @xmath14 gev ) , but did not give the angular correlation as a function of @xmath15 for the selected events .",
    "meanwhile babar gave a dalitz plot of @xmath16@xcite from which one can read the same trend as belle s angular dependence .",
    "rosner@xcite argued qualitatively in terms of quark diagrams@xcite and predicted this angular correlation with baryon production through diquarks .",
    "but the argument does not seem to work for all baryonic modes in its simple form .",
    "cheng and others@xcite computed the decay amplitudes in the pole model with factorization , leaving out inelastic form factor terms@xcite .",
    "their result does not lead to the correct angular correlation in the case of @xmath17 .",
    "the simple sd picture presented at the beginning is successful in the angular correlation of most three - body baryonic modes , _",
    "@xmath18 , but fails notably for @xmath17 .",
    "its failure suggests us importance of long - distance ( ld ) effects somewhere in the decay process .",
    "indeed , the fragmentation by quark diagram and the pole model both contain some of the ld effects in very different ways . in this paper",
    "we take a close look at this angular correlation of @xmath1 from the viewpoint of partial waves in general and try to resurrect the simple sd picture by incorporating an appropriate ld effect in it .    in our proposed analysis",
    "we first examine the partial - wave content of @xmath3 in @xmath17 ( and its conjugate ) and conclude purely kinematically that the @xmath3 enhancement can not be a broad resonance . for the same reason we rule out strong final - state interaction ( fsi ) in a single @xmath3 partial wave as a cause of the enhancement .",
    "we shall observe that reversal of the angular correlation occurs if some ld effect flips relative signs of partial - wave decay amplitudes .",
    "such sign flip may indeed occur if @xmath4 bound states exist in right channels .",
    "the recently discovered state @xmath19@xcite is a good candidate that may be responsible for the sign flip .",
    "if @xmath19 should be an @xmath4 bound state , we expect a similar bound state in other channels from our reasoning of the sign flip .",
    "we study the angular correlation between the proton momentum and the kaon momentum in the rest frame of @xmath3 by choosing the @xmath21-axis along the @xmath8 momentum .",
    "2 )    since @xmath13 meson and @xmath8 meson are spinless and their momenta are both along the @xmath21-direction in the @xmath3 rest frame , the @xmath21-component of total angular momentum is zero for @xmath3 by @xmath22 in this frame .",
    "following the standard helicity formalism@xcite , we can describe the angular dependence of the helicity decay amplitudes with wigner s @xmath23-functions @xcite as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the helicities of @xmath12 and @xmath10 in the @xmath3 rest frame , @xmath27 are the angles of the proton momentum in this frame ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and @xmath28 is a function of the @xmath3 invariant mass @xmath15 .",
    "since experiment does not measure helicity of proton nor antiproton but sums over all helicity states in what follows , the differential decay rates are @xmath29 independent .",
    "therefore we need not specify the direction of @xmath30 in our case .",
    "direction if a final particle spin is measured or if a final particle having spin undergoes a cascade decay and this decay angular correlation is measured . ] squaring the amplitude and summing over the @xmath3 helicities @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we obtain the differential decay rate : @xmath31 where @xmath32 includes kinematical factors that depend on @xmath15 .",
    "if we make the usual assumption that the strong penguin interaction dominates in the decay @xmath33 , the cp - violating phases drop out of the decay rate . under parity reflection the angle @xmath34 remains unchanged , while under charge conjugation the angle @xmath34 turns into @xmath35 of @xmath36 because of the interchange @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 we shall be able to use this equality as a test of the penguin dominance .",
    "the corresponding relation holds between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    at this stage",
    "we can prove that the @xmath3 enhancement is not a resonance , for instance , a glueball@xcite : the wigner functions @xmath42 , which are proportional to the associated legendre functions , possess a special symmetry property under @xmath43@xcite , @xmath44 if the @xmath3 pair is produced entirely through a resonance , only the term of the resonance spin @xmath45 contributes in eq .",
    "( [ angular2 ] ) without sum over @xmath45 . since the function @xmath46 is unchanged under @xmath47 ( _ i.e. , _",

    "although interference between the resonant and nonresonant amplitudes of different @xmath45 can produce some asymmetry in principle , such interference should be insignificant under the normal circumstance where the resonant amplitude acquires the phase @xmath54 through the resonant decay relative to the nonresonant amplitude : @xmath55 .",
    "it is implicitly assumed here as usual that the nonresonant production amplitude dose not acquire a significant phase .",
    "if for some reason the large asymmetry of fig.3 should be caused by the interference between the resonant and nonresonant amplitudes of different @xmath45 s , the very small yield observed toward @xmath56 in fig .",
    "3 would mean nearly perfect destructive interference between them . in this case the nonresonant yield would have to be just as large as the resonant one .",
    "therefore the marked asymmetry in the angular correlation rules out convincingly the hypothesis of pure resonant production .",
    "if one attempts to explain the the enhancement by strong fsi in a single dominant partial - wave channel of @xmath3@xcite , one would likewise obtain @xmath57 for the angular correlation . to be consistent with the observed angular correlation , partial - wave amplitudes of even and odd @xmath45 must coexist and almost maximally interfere .",
    "our argument is very general and independent of dynamics up to this point .",
    "we now proceed to take dynamics into account .    in the sd picture the spectator @xmath11-quark of",

    "in contrast , the proton consists of three energetic quarks ; one from the primary decay interaction and two of pair - produced quarks . in the @xmath13 rest frame , therefore , the proton recoils against @xmath8 more energetically on average than the antiproton does .",
    "it means that in the @xmath3 rest frame , the proton tends to move away from @xmath8 faster than the antiproton does .",
    "that is , @xmath61 contrary to the measurement .",
    "this is the `` angular correlation puzzle '' .",
    "no reasonable explanation has been given from the sd viewpoint .",
    "we must look for some ld interaction effect that has not been commonly appreciated .",
    "the maximum of the @xmath3 enhancement occurs near @xmath62 2 gev in the babar data@xcite and roughly @xmath632.2 gev in the belle data@xcite .",

    "the same statement holds valid for @xmath12-waves alone .",
    "the observed steep asymmetry ( fig .",

    "it is very important experimentally to study how the angular correlation varies as @xmath12-waves increase with @xmath15 relative to @xmath59-waves across the threshold enhancement .",

    "it is not crucial to the essence of our qualitative argument .",
    "while an accurate prediction is difficult because of our deficiency in knowledge of the quark distribution in baryons , the sd argument predicts , as we have argued above , the sign of slope opposite to fig .",

    "( [ exp1 ] ) or ( [ exp2 ] ) . in the next section",
    "we argue that the desired sign reversal may occur if bound states exist in some of the @xmath3 channels . unlike the argument that has ruled out a @xmath3 resonance , this is speculative and admittedly less clean part of our argument .",
    "the three - body final - state interaction fsi was analysed in the approximation of sum of two - body fsi since going beyond is mathematically formidable@xcite . fortunately ,",
    "in the particle configuration of our interest where the invariant mass of @xmath3 is small and the @xmath111 meson recoils fast against @xmath3 , it is a good approximation and at least a common practice to separate the two - body fsi of @xmath3 ignoring the rest of fsi .",
    "inclusion of @xmath3 annihilation channels is more a difficult problem .",
    "if one wants to make a quantitative analysis , this will be a main source of uncertainty .",
    "was recently studied for an enhancement in @xmath112@xcite . in this process",
    ", @xmath15 is even closer to the threshold and consequently the coulombic fsi may be relevant . ]",
    "our task here is not to obtain numerically accurate results but to search a possible cause of sign flip for the amplitudes in the fsi . in order to make the sign flip argument plausible , we do not need much more than a basic argument of the elastic two - body fsi and its diagrammatic explanation .    the standard practice in fsi resorts to potential theory and incorporates fsi by modifying the decay amplitudes with final particle rescattering as@xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 stands for the jost function@xcite of a partial - wave eigenchannel in variable @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "it is normalized to @xmath117 .",
    "this fsi factor sums up ladders or bubbles of final particle rescattering in potential .",
    "the jost function can be expressed with the phase of scattering amplitude @xmath118 in the omns representation@xcite ; @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath121 of the dispersion integral is extended to the negative region ( @xmath122 ) when @xmath3 annihilation into meson channels is taken into account .",
    "if annihilation and inelastic scattering are ignored , the phase @xmath123 would be equal to the phase shift of @xmath4 scattering according to the so - called watson s theorem@xcite . if there is a resonance in this elastic case , the phase shift @xmath123 rises from zero , passes through @xmath124 at the resonance ( @xmath125 ) and approaches @xmath126 as @xmath127 .",
    "therefore the phase of the decay amplitude acquires a minus sign ( @xmath128 ) above the resonance @xmath129 .",
    "this negative sign is easily understood in diagram . when a final particle pair is produced through a resonance , as depicted in fig .",
    "5 for @xmath17 , the decay amplitude near the resonance takes the form of @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the amplitude in the absence of a resonance , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the resonance mass and width , and @xmath134 is _ positive _ at @xmath135 .",
    "the reason for positivity of @xmath136 is as follows : by the phase theorem of fsi@xcite , it holds that @xmath137 = \\delta^{ji}(s)$ ] .",

    "the function @xmath134 is expected to be only mildly energy dependent even near the threshold since the centrifugal factor @xmath144 of orbital motion resides in @xmath145 and @xmath131 , not in @xmath134 . since @xmath134 @xmath146 is positive",
    ", the sign of @xmath145 is the same as that of @xmath131 below the resonance ( @xmath147 ) , but turns opposite above the resonance ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "this is another way of seeing the sign and energy dependence of the fsi factor across a resonance .",
    "this simple argument is modified by inelasticity above the @xmath149 threshold and by annihilation into meson channels . above the energies where inelastic channels start contributing substantially at @xmath150 , the fsi formulas of potential theory",
    "is no longer applicable . if we simply truncate the phase integral in eq .",
    "( [ fsi ] ) at @xmath151 somewhere above the inelastic threshold , the fsi factor computed in the narrow - width ( step - function ) approximation turns out to be @xmath152 which satisfies @xmath153 as @xmath154 .",
    "this fsi factor is negative between the resonance and the inelastic threshold ; @xmath155 it means that the fsi factor gives a minus sign above the resonance until energy goes up so high that inelasticity becomes important .",
    "while the negative sign is easy to understand , magnitude of the fsi factor is harder to estimate since it depends on the dispersion integral over the entire energy range .",
    "let us turn to the effect of the annihilation channels into mesons .",
    "the first issue is that the phase @xmath118 of the decay amplitude is no longer equal to the phase of the @xmath4 scattering amplitude at any energy where annihilation occurs .",
    "an approximate equality between two phases holds only in those eigenchannels in which the channel coupling is weak between @xmath4 and the meson channels .",
    "it is not obvious whether this is the case for the relevant @xmath4 channels near the threshold .",
    "we must assume it here .",
    "discussion will be made on this point below and in the next section .",
    "the other issue is whether relevant @xmath4 resonances really exist or not .",
    "the candidates of @xmath4 bound states and resonances indeed exist .",
    "since the @xmath4 bound states can be only loosely bound , @xmath156 and @xmath157 are spatially separated outside the range of annihilation interaction and therefore the annihilation into mesons is suppressed . meanwhile , being a bound state , the state can not decay into a nucleon and an antinucleon since its mass @xmath158 is below the @xmath4 threshold ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "however , there is an escape from this argument : the finite lifetime due to meson annihilation generates a width to the mass of the bound - state by the time - energy uncertainty . if this width is a little wider than the binding energy @xmath160 , the @xmath4 `` bound state '' can decay into @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "this decay suffers a severe phase space suppression .",
    "when the @xmath4 bound state is produced `` on mass shell '' ( @xmath161 with @xmath162 being the width ) , its decay branching fraction to the @xmath4 channel is small even if its coupling to @xmath4 is strong , _ i.e. , _ even if @xmath134 in eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) is large .",
    "consequently , such an @xmath4 bound state would appear as a relatively narrow meson resonance .",
    "on the other hand , when an @xmath4 pair is produced above the width of the bound state , the bound state can still enhance @xmath4 production through the small denominator of the resonance propagator . in experiment",
    "the transition from `` on - shell '' to `` off - shell '' occurs continuously above the threshold .",
    "the phase - space factor pushes the enhancement peak upwards from @xmath163 to @xmath164 .",
    "when the phase - space factor is removed , the yield curve is expected to behave like @xmath165 $ ] at @xmath166 .",
    "the bes collaboration@xcite first extracted the resonance parameters on this assumption when analysis was made only above the @xmath3 threshold in @xmath167 . in the three - body baryonic @xmath0 decay ,",
    "the events of small @xmath168 receive the sd enhancement , as we have argued .",
    "the same sd effect would be less prominent in @xmath169 decay since the phase space is much smaller .",
    "consequently the location and the shape of the enhancement may not be identical in @xmath0 and @xmath169 decays .",
    "magnitude of the net @xmath3 enhancement is also dependent on dynamical environment of production . despite such dynamical uncertainties we are fairly confident that if enhancement indeed occurs in the region of @xmath170 , and if it couples to a state below it , the decay amplitude acquires the negative sign of fsi according to the diagram in fig . 5 and the discussion following eq . ( [ res ] ) .",
    "we remark on the coupling between @xmath4 and the annihilation channels . in the @xmath3 reaction at the threshold",
    "the annihilation cross section is larger than the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "can it be compatible with weak coupling between @xmath4 and annihilation channels ?",
    "we should first note that the annihilation cross sections fall very rapidly with the inverse flux factor @xmath171 above the threshold according to the `` @xmath172 '' law of the exothermic reactions .",
    "we should also note that the large annihilation cross section is largely due to multitude of multi - meson annihilation channels with many different partial waves of subchannels .",

    "however , we should keep our mind open to the other possibilities of sign reversal in the @xmath12-wave amplitudes . in order to make further advance , we need to know more about @xmath19 and to search for more candidates of the @xmath4 bound states . in experiment of @xmath0 meson physics , we are anxious to know the @xmath15 dependence of the angular correlation since it will provide important pieces of information about spin - parity , mass and isospin of the bound states .    as for @xmath192 ,",
    "the measurement was made for the oscillating @xmath193-@xmath194 averaged over time and therefore no flavor information is available@xcite .",
    "so long as the penguin interaction dominates , the time - averaged @xmath195 angular distribution is symmetric under @xmath196 in general .",
    "( [ angular3 ] ) . ) specifically , if we keep only the amplitudes of @xmath197 and @xmath198 in eq .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the curve of this angular correlation for @xmath195 is concave in @xmath98 .",
    "the data@xcite in fig .",
    "7 indeed show the tendency of roughly @xmath200 albeit with very large uncertainty .",
    "the branching fraction was also measured@xcite and its ratio to that of @xmath16 is @xmath201 with roughly @xmath202% of statistical errors and @xmath203% of systematic errors",
    ". this number would be 0.5 if the @xmath183 amplitudes completely dominates over the @xmath190 amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ i=0 ] ) .",
    "if the i=1 amplitudes are about 20% of the @xmath183 amplitudes , however , this ratio 0.23 can be reproduced .",
    "the threshold enhancement has been observed in other three - body baryonic final states , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 ( charge conjugated states combined ) as well as in @xmath208 and many decay modes of the @xmath209 transition .",
    "however , the angular correlation has been measured only for a few of them ; @xmath205 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 all in low statistics .",
    "let us look into the @xmath204 enhancement observed in @xmath212 and @xmath208 of @xmath194 decay and the conjugate , for which the dominant process is the penguin decay .    in the color - dominant process of @xmath213 the spectator @xmath58-quark forms @xmath214 through capture by the energetic @xmath215-quark that comes directly from the strong penguin interaction .",
    "since neither @xmath216 nor @xmath10 picks up the slow spectator , their average energies in the @xmath194 rest frame should be comparable .",
    "that is , the @xmath217 angular correlation in the @xmath204 rest frame ought to be more or less symmetric and flat in @xmath218 .",
    "this naive sd prediction is in line with experiment within large uncertainty : the measured angular correlation@xcite does not show marked asymmetry nor large variation in @xmath218 .",
    "( see fig . 8 . )",
    "the @xmath217 angular distribution can be fitted with any of @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 with small constant @xmath222 .",
    "although the angular distribution is consistent with the sd prediction , one can not rule out a resonance for the @xmath204 enhancement : a resonance of @xmath64 leading to @xmath223 is certainly acceptable .",
    "a resonance of @xmath66 is neither ruled out since the flat distribution arises with @xmath224 .",
    "let us turn to @xmath208 . in the sd picture the energetic @xmath59-quark",
    "is emitted against @xmath225 by the radiative penguin interaction and becomes the constituent of @xmath216 .",
    "other quarks and antiquarks are produced through strong interaction nearly collinearly against @xmath225 to avoid creating a fat gluon .",
    "since the spectator @xmath58 enters in @xmath10 , the antiproton is less energetic in the rest frame of @xmath194 than @xmath216 .",
    "the sd prediction is therefore that @xmath10 moves along @xmath225 in the @xmath204 rest frame , that is , @xmath226 should rise toward @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the angle between @xmath10 and @xmath225 in the @xmath204 rest frame .",
    "the observed @xmath229 angular correlation clearly shows this trend in line with the sd prediction .",
    "( see fig . 9 . )",
    "although the sd prediction is right for @xmath230 , a resonance can not be ruled out for @xmath204 .",
    "the helicity expansion of the @xmath208 amplitude is modified by spin of @xmath225 .",
    "the helicity of @xmath225 is @xmath231 since the @xmath59-quark emitted by the penguin interaction is left - handed .",
    "therefore the component of total angular momentum along the photon momentum @xmath232 is @xmath233 for @xmath204 in their rest frame .",
    "the @xmath204 angular correlation is given generally by @xmath234 note here that the first subscript of @xmath235 is @xmath219 owing to @xmath236 .",
    "the @xmath204 enhancement can not be a resonance of @xmath64 since @xmath237 for @xmath238 .",
    "however , we can not rule out a @xmath66 resonance since with @xmath239 the linear correlation @xmath240 arises if the helicity amplitudes for @xmath208 happen to obey , for instance , @xmath241 because of the preferred photon helicity , the @xmath229 angular correlation can be asymmetric under @xmath242 even with a single partial wave unlike those of @xmath175 and @xmath217 . combining our observations in @xmath243 and @xmath18 together , we can rule out a @xmath64 resonance for @xmath204 , but not a @xmath66 resonance",
    ". however , there is no motivation to call for a @xmath204 resonance or bound state at present until we see clear discrepancy with the sd prediction .",
    "three - body baryonic decay modes are favoured over two - body baryonic decay modes since a baryon - antibaryon pair may be emitted nearly collinearly in three - body decay .",
    "indeed experiment confirms that the invariant mass of the baryon - antibaryon pair is strongly enhanced near the threshold in most modes .",
    "although the sd picture appears to describe general trends of three - body decays in most cases , we have encountered one clear contradiction with the sd picture in the angular correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath244 in @xmath1 .",
    "failure of the sd picture means that some ld effect enters the process of @xmath17 and reverses the angular dependence .",
    "we have pointed our finger to the nucleon - antinucleon bound states for the cause of sign flip of the sd amplitudes and have given a simple diagrammatic explanation for it . to explain the decay angular correlation for @xmath36",
    ", we have postulated that @xmath19 be the @xmath93 bound state of @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath19 is a molecular six - quark state @xmath245 or a deuteron - like state and primarily couples to @xmath4 rather than to mesons .",
    "many theorists have made the same or similar proposals on the nature of @xmath19 , with motivations very different from ours .",
    "in addition , we need a @xmath94 bound state of @xmath4 .",
    "the maximum asymmetry of the angular correlation should occur at the energy where kinematically rising @xmath12-wave amplitudes become comparable with the falling @xmath59-wave amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath15 angular dependence will tell us a lot about dynamics near the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "our argument depends on strong interaction dynamics near the @xmath4 threshold that has not been proven nor disproven experimentally .",
    "some might feel that we have blown out a possible solution to a small puzzle into a farfetched speculation .",
    "we can not counter such objections effectively . our argument presented in this paper",
    "is a conjecture or a hypothesis , certainly not a theorem .",
    "although our argument is only exploratory and speculative , the sign flip by a bound state or a resonance can occur generally and cause failure of the simple quark - gluon argument of multi - body @xmath0 meson decay .",
    "while our argument of the sign flip is exploratory in nature , we would like to emphasize that the partial - wave expansion analysed here will be very useful as a general tool to penetrate into complexity of three - body decay dynamics . to show its usefulness , we have ruled out convincingly the resonance hypothesis for the @xmath3 threshold enhancement .",
    "we have also shown that the fsi in @xmath59-waves or in @xmath12-waves alone should not describe the enhancement either . while the angular correlation measurement is not extensive nor accurate enough at present , we expect that partial - wave analysis of three - body decay will shed more of new light on dynamics of @xmath0 decay in near future since the data are rapidly accumulating .",
