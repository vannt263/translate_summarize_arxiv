    "hard spheres packing has a reach research history , especially in maths but also in natural science , due to it s potential application .",
    "attention has been mostly paid to maximal packing as it has many important implications , for example in crystallography .",
    "the fundamental property defining packing is its density @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is dimension of space , @xmath4 is a number of spheres in a unit volume , and @xmath5 is a volume of @xmath3 dimensional sphere having radius @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the euler gamma function .",
    "the problem of maximal spheres packing is trivial in one dimension , simple in two dimensions and only recently has been proved in three dimensional space @xcite . for higher dimensions , it still remains open .",
    "presented work , however , focuses on maximal random packing .",
    "it is derived from colloids study , namely , modelling of irreversible adsorption processes , in which molecules are randomly placed on a collector surface .",
    "once adsorbed , a molecule retains its position on a surface .",
    "such adsorption layer grows till there is available uncovered place large enough to place subsequent molecules .",
    "as the simplest and most commonly used model of adsorbed molecule is sphere , the properties of adsorption layers are directly connected with random maximal packing of spheres . here , the only analytically solved case is a one - dimensional problem , also known also as car parking problem , for which @xmath8@xcite .",
    "solutions in higher dimensions were found only numerically , however , it is worth to notice that there is a number of analytically solvable models for lattice - like collectors e.g.  @xcite .",
    "for flat , homogeneous and continuous collectors , the most extensively studied case is a two - dimensional problem due to its potential application in chemistry and material science @xcite .",
    "the analysis of hard spheres random packing for @xmath9 , nicely reviewed in @xcite , provides phenomenological relation , further slightly corrected later in @xcite , between maximal random coverage ratio and collector dimension : @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "there are also some characteristics , which do not depend qualitatively on dimension .",
    "for example , the two - point density correlation function for maximal random coverages is known to have super - exponential decay with growing distance @xcite @xmath13 and logarithmic singularity when particles are in touch @xcite @xmath14    aim of present work is to check validity of the above relations for adsorption on fractal collectors with structure similar to the menger sponge .",
    "we decided to focus on this kind of collectors because its structure remains zeolites , which were extensively studied in the context of adsorption , e.g.@xcite .",
    "adsorption experiments using fractal - like collectors were made by kinge et al .",
    "@xcite , though preparation of such surfaces is quite complicated . on the other hand",
    ", there are number of natural porous media when adsorption plays an important role there @xcite . for example , fractal - like structure of corals helps them to catch plankton effectively @xcite .",
    "adsorption on fractal collectors might also be applied in environmental protection in designing effective filters @xcite .",
    "other studies on fractal collectors investigate diffusion properties @xcite or adsorption on rough surfaces @xcite . on the other hand , fractal structures",
    "were also observed as a result of adsorption @xcite .",
    "however , the only similar study concerning adsorption on fractal collectors is limited to collectors of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the most common method of obtaining numerically the maximal random coverages uses random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) algorithm @xcite described in detail in sec.[sec : model ] .",
    "the kinetics of rsa simulation has also been of our interest because it affects @xmath16 estimation .",
    "moreover , it was observed that for sufficiently long simulation time , the coverage ratio @xmath17 scales with collector s dimension @xcite : @xmath18 here @xmath19 .",
    "the above relation is all the more important as it is also valid for other molecules , more complex than simple spheres @xcite .",
    "maximal random coverages are generated using rsa algorithm , which has been successfully applied to study colloids .",
    "it is based on independent , repeated attempts of adding sphere to a covering film .",
    "the numerical procedure is carried out in the following steps :    i : :    a virtual sphere is created with its centre position on a collector    chosen randomly according to the uniform probability distribution ; ii : :    an overlapping test is performed for previously adsorbed nearest    neighbors of the virtual particle .",
    "the test checks if    surface - to - surface distance between spheres is greater than zero ; iii : :    if there is no overlap the virtual particle is irreversibly adsorbed    and added to an existing covering layer",
    ". its position does not change    during further calculations ; iiii : :    if there is an overlap the virtual sphere is removed and abandoned .",
    "attempts are repeated iteratively .",
    "their number is typically expressed in a  dimensionless time units : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a number of attempts and @xmath22 denotes a volume of a single sphere projection on a collector ( note that only the center of a sphere has to be on collector ) and @xmath23 is a collector volume , assuming its integer dimension . here , in @xmath24 the volume of any collector is formally zero . on the other hand ,",
    "any given value of @xmath23 is only a scale factor of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of our study , we assumed @xmath26 , which is the volume of an overlapping cube .",
    "collectors were modelled as a successive iteration of a given fractal .",
    "they were constructed starting with a single cube , then dividing it into 27 subcubes and finally removing some of them .",
    "then the procedure was repeated iteratively for each of the remaining subcubes .",
    "the real fractal is achieved after an infinite number of iterations .",
    "its dimension is given by relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a number of remaining subcubes in each iteration and @xmath29 is a change of scale . in our case , @xmath30 .",
    "for example for menger sponge @xmath31 so @xmath32 . with each of the 27 subcubes marked with",
    "its cartesian coordinates , the fractal can be fully described by coordinates of removed or retained subcubes . for convenience , basic properties of fractal collectors used in this study were collected in tab.[tab : fractals ] .",
    "mmm removed subcubes coordinates & fractal dimension d & 1@xmath33 iteration of a  collector + all but 113 , 131 , 222 , 311 , 333 & 1.4650 &   + all but 111 , 113 , 131 , 133 , 222 , 311 , 313 , 331 , 333 & 2.0 &   + 112 , 121 , 123 , 132 , 211 , 213 , 222 , 231 , 233 , 311 , 313 , 331 , 333 & 2.4022 &   + 122 , 211 , 212 , 213 , 221 , 223 , 231 , 232 , 233 , 322 & 2.5789 &   + 122 , 212 , 221 , 222 , 223 , 232 , 322 & 2.7268 &   + 211 , 213 , 231 , 233 & 2.8540 &   + 222 & 2.9656 &   +    for each collector type @xmath34 independent numerical experiments have been performed .",
    "each of them last @xmath35 .    typically coverage ratio is estimated by a number of adsorbed molecules . however , this approximation can be misleading when collector dimension differs from adsorbate dimension .",
    "therefore , by analogy with integer dimension cases , covered area is limited to a cross - section of collector and adsorbate sphere .",
    "for this reason , the coverage ratio of a given adsorption layer is determined using random sampling of collector points and checking whether they are covered by any sphere adsorbed earlier : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a number of covered points after a dimensionless time @xmath38 ; @xmath39 denotes total number of sampled points .",
    "here @xmath40 , which provides statistical error at the level of @xmath41 .",
    "in performed simulations a real fractal was approximated by a its finite iteration . to check the level of possible systematic error introduced by such approximation we plotted maximal random coverage as a function of fractal iteration .",
    "results presented in fig.[fig : iterations ] show that measured values stabilize around @xmath42 iteration .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of this study , we assumed that results obtained for @xmath43 iteration math the true ones .",
    "the maximal random coverage is achieved after an infinite simulation time . therefore",
    "to measure its value in finite simulations , the rsa kinetics model has to be used .",
    "the analysis of earlier numerical experiments shows that rsa for spheres in integer and fractal dimensions obeys the feder s law ( [ eq : feder ] ) @xcite .",
    "the most convenient way to determine exponent in ( [ eq : feder ] ) is to find the time derivative of coverage ratio : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "results presented in fig.[fig : p_t ] show that feder s law slightly underestimates adsorption speed or equivalently slightly overestimates collector dimension .",
    "however , the difference would be practically imperceptible it the @xmath17 dependence on dimensionless time was analyzed as in @xcite . for the sparsest collectors the relation ( [ qt ] ) is not valid and , therefore , parameter @xmath46 can not be determined .",
    "this is analogous to the case of cantor dust and some cantor sets discussed in @xcite .     whereas solid line is determined using feder s law ( [ eq : feder ] ) .",
    "inset shows power law dependence of the number of packed spheres on dimensionless time ( [ qt]).,width=302 ]    the adsorption speed @xmath47 may also be analyzed as a function of @xmath48 ; then , it is called available surface function ( asf ) .",
    "such approach is commonly used in material science and especially in low coverage limit , because it allows to determine viral coefficients of the equilibrium coverage state @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are expansion constants and they are connected with volume blocked by particle and a complex of two particles , respectively .",
    "for example , in a low coverage limit , a single ball covers @xmath52 , but , from the point of view of another ball center , it blocks all the volume inside a sphere of @xmath53 radius ( see fig.[fig : ev ] ) .    ) .",
    "right : overlap of excluded volumes of two different particles.,width=302 ]    therefore , using ( [ eq : vd ] ) @xmath54 for higher coverages the exclusion volumes start to overlap , which slightly reduces the total amount of blocked space .",
    "therefore , by analogy with the reasoning presented in @xcite , parameter @xmath51 is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 } \\int_0^{\\cos^{-1 } \\frac{r}{4r_0 } } \\sin^d t \\,\\,dt\\ ] ] is the overlapped volume and @xmath57 is @xmath58-surface of @xmath3-sphere of radius @xmath59 .",
    "values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 measured in numerical experiments are shown in fig.[fig : c1c2 ] .     and",
    "@xmath51 on collector dimension .",
    "circles ( @xmath50 ) and squares ( @xmath51 ) represent obtained data while solid lines are analitical fits.,width=302 ]    values of @xmath50 fits well the theoretical approximation . in case of @xmath51",
    "the match is slightly worse , however , numerical data are generally arranged along the analytically obtained values .      despite the lack of analitical results for maximal random coverage ratio for @xmath60",
    "there are several studies providing lower and upper limit of its value , e.g. @xcite .",

    "for @xmath3 close to @xmath63 , density autocorrelation function has got a typical shape .",
    "its decay is fast and it has logarithmic singularity at kissing limit ( @xmath64 ) , exactly as predicted by ( [ eq : corfast ] ) and ( [ eq : corlog ] ) .",
    "situation changes in two cases in which @xmath65 .",
    "then , the correlations have long range structure .",
