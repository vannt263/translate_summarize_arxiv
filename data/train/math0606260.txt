    "the motivation for the introduction of global actions by a. bak @xcite was to provide an algebraic setting in which to bring higher algebraic @xmath0-theory nearer to the intuitions of the original work of j.h.c .",
    "whitehead on @xmath1 . in this work ,",
    "elementary matrices , and sequences of their actions on the general linear group , play a key rle .",
    "the geometric origin for @xmath2 came from whitehead s plan to seek a generalisation to all dimensions of the tietze equivalence theorem in combinatorial group theory : this theorem states that two finite presentations of isomorphic groups may be transformed from one to the other by a finite sequence of elementary moves , called tietze transformations .",
    "these algebraic moves were translated by whitehead into the geometric moves of _ elementary collapses and expansions _ of finite simplicial complexes : this gave the notion of _ simple homotopy equivalence_. the astonishing conclusion of his work was that there was an obstruction to a homotopy equivalence @xmath3 of finite simplicial complexes being a simple homotopy equivalence , and that this lay in a quotient group of a group he defined , namely @xmath1 where @xmath4 is the integral group ring of @xmath5 .",
    "since then , there was a search for higher order groups @xmath6 , which were finally defined by quillen as homotopy groups of a space @xmath7 , the homotopy fibre of a map @xmath8 .",
    "this was a great result , but this excursion into topology has meant that the original combinatorial intuitions get somewhat lost .",
    "bak , in @xcite , for instance , found that to deal with stability questions and higher @xmath0-groups it was useful to consider a family of elementary matrices , and that the theory in general could be seen as a family of group actions , indexed by a set with a relation @xmath9 , often a partial order , and with certain ` patching conditions ' .",
    "this became his ` global action ' , which was viewed as a kind of ` algebraic manifold ' , analogous to the notion of topological manifold , but in an algebraic setting .",
    "a global action was , by analogy with the atlases of the theory of manifolds , an _ atlas of actions_. thus ` local ' meant at one group action , and ` global ' meant understanding the interaction of them all .",
    "the elaboration of the definition was intended to cope with paths , to define an analogue of @xmath2 , and paths of paths , to deal with higher order questions .    in discussions at bangor and bielefeld ,",
    "it was seen that : ( a ) there were interesting applications of global actions to identities among relations for groups with a specified family of subgroups , and ( b ) there were advantages in using the well known transition from group actions to groupoids given by the action groupoid of an action , to rephrase the definition of global action so that it became part of a slightly wider concept , _ atlases of groupoids _ , or as we will nearly always say , _",
    "groupoid atlases_. the individual groupoids would play the analogous role to the _ charts _ in the definition of a manifold .",
    "this generalisation would allow a wider scope for the theory , since groupoids can generalise not only groups and group actions but also equivalence relations .",
    "further , the notion of a presentation of a groupoid allows for potential extensions of these ideas to resolutions , and so to higher dimensions .",
    "there are even further possibilities .",
    "the intention is to loosen the restriction to having algebraic control of a system to be specified in terms of _ globally defined _ algebraic structures , but to have also the possibility of a _ locally defined _ algebraic structure .",
    "( one could imagine that this idea might be important in some areas of physics , where immediate information , such as symmetry , is given locally . )",
    "it is interesting to compare this idea with other tools for local - to - global problems involving ` patching ' , of which the most notable and very well explored is the notion of sheaf .",
    "an advantage of global actions and groupoid atlases over other previously defined tools is the possibility of incorporating in the theory the notion of _ elementary process _ , and paths and homotopies of paths .",
    "this allows concrete notions of higher homotopies to be studied and used .    the notes on which this paper is based were produced by tim porter , on the basis of lectures by bak , together with discussions in bangor and bielefeld .",
    "a version has been available since then as a bangor preprint @xcite .",
    "the motivating idea is of a family of interacting and overlapping local @xmath10-sets for varying @xmath10 .",
    "the prime example is the underlying set @xmath11 operated on by the family of subgroups @xmath12 which are generated by elementary matrices of a certain form @xmath13",
    ". we will give the details of this example shortly , but first we will set up some basic terminology and notation concerning group actions ( @xmath10-sets ) , before we give the definition of a global action .    a ( left ) group action consists of a group @xmath10 and a set @xmath14 on which @xmath10 acts on the left ; we will write @xmath15 .",
    "this means that there is a function from the set @xmath16 to @xmath14 written as @xmath17 goes to @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is often convenient to omit the dot so we may write @xmath23 instead of @xmath18 .",
    "a morphism of group actions , @xmath24 , consists of a homomorphism of groups @xmath25 and a function @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "the promised ` global version ' of this is :    a _ global action _",
    "@xmath28 consists of a set @xmath29 together with :    a.   an indexing set @xmath30 , called the _ coordinate system _ of @xmath28 ; b.   a reflexive relation , written @xmath9 , on @xmath30 ; c.   a family @xmath31 of group actions on subsets @xmath32 ; the @xmath33 are called the _",
    "local groups _ of the global action ;",
    "d.   for each pair @xmath34 in @xmath30 , a group morphism @xmath35 e.   this data is required to satisfy : f.   if @xmath36 in @xmath30 , then @xmath37 leaves @xmath38 invariant ; g.   if @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then @xmath41    the diagram @xmath42 is called the _ global group _ of @xmath28 .",
    "the set @xmath29 is the _ enveloping set _ or _ underlying set _ of @xmath28 .",
    "the notation @xmath43 or @xmath44 for @xmath29 is sometimes used for emphasis or to avoid confusion since @xmath45 is also a useful notation , where @xmath46 is the powerset of @xmath29 .",
    "a.   for technical reasons it is not assumed that the collection @xmath47 necessarily covers @xmath29 .",
    "this holds in all the basic examples we will examine but is not a requirement .",
    "b.   the relation @xmath9 is not assumed to be transitive on @xmath30 , so really @xmath48 is not a functor .",
    "however , the difference is minor as , if @xmath49 denotes the free category on the graph of @xmath50 , then @xmath48 extends to a functor @xmath51 .",
    "we will usually refer , as here , to @xmath48 as a diagram of groups and will sometimes use ` natural transformation ' to mean a generalised natural transformation defined on the generating graphs , which yields an actual natural transformation on the corresponding extensions .",
    "it will sometimes be useful to consider groups as single object groupoids , in which case the above yields a diagram of groupoids .",
    "the simplest global actions come with just a single domain : a global action @xmath28 is said to be _ single domain _ if for each @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a group , @xmath53 a family of subgroups of @xmath10 .",
    "for the moment @xmath54 is just a set ( that is : @xmath34 in @xmath54 if and only if @xmath55 ) .",
    "define @xmath56 to be the global action with @xmath57 ( so the local orbits of the @xmath58-action are the left cosets of @xmath58 ) .    later on in section [ subdivagh ] , we will need to refine this construction , [ secondagh]taking @xmath59 to be the family of finite non - empty subsets of @xmath54 ordered by opposite inclusion and with @xmath60 if @xmath61 .",
    "we will later look in some detail at certain specific such single domain global actions .",
    "the following prime motivating example is similar to these , but the indexing set / coordinate system is slightly more complex .",
    "* the general linear global action @xmath62.*[gln ] let @xmath4 be an associative ring with identity and @xmath63 a positive integer .",
    "let @xmath64 be the set of non - diagonal positions in an @xmath65 array . call a subset @xmath66",
    "_ closed _ if @xmath67    note that if @xmath68 and @xmath13 is closed then @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 .",
    "we put a reflexive relation @xmath9 on @xmath54 by @xmath34 if @xmath71 .",
    "now suppose @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the _ elementary matrix _",
    "@xmath74 is the matrix obtained from the identity @xmath65 matrix by putting the element @xmath75 in position @xmath76 , @xmath77 let @xmath12 , for @xmath78 , denote the subgroup of @xmath11 generated by @xmath79 it is easy to see that @xmath80 if and only if @xmath81 for @xmath34 , there is an inclusion of @xmath82 into @xmath83",
    ". this will give the homomorphism @xmath84 let @xmath85 act by left multiplication on @xmath86 .",
    "this completes the description of the single domain global action @xmath87 .",
    "later we will see how to define the fundamental group and more generally the higher homotopy groups of a global action .",
    "the @xmath88-homotopy group of @xmath87 is the algebraic @xmath0-theory group @xmath89 and the usual algebraic @xmath0-group , @xmath6 is the direct limit of @xmath90 by the obvious maps induced from the inclusions @xmath91 .",
    "the way that a global action extends local information to become global information can be observed from the simplest cases of the @xmath92 .",
    "if @xmath93 has just a single group @xmath94 in it , then the global action is just the collection of orbits , i.e. right cosets .",
    "there is no interaction between them .",
    "if @xmath93 consists of distinct subgroups @xmath95 , then any @xmath96-orbit intersects with any @xmath97-orbit ,",
    "so now orbits do interact .",
    "how they interact can be very influential on the homotopy properties of the situation .",
    "[ s3 ] as a simple example consider the symmetric group @xmath98 , with @xmath99 denoting the 3-cycle ( 1  2  3 ) and @xmath100 the transposition ( 1  2 ) .",
    "take @xmath101 yielding two orbits for its left action on @xmath102 .",
    "similarly take @xmath103 giving local orbits @xmath104 .",
    "any @xmath96-orbit intersects with any @xmath97-orbit , but of course they do not overlap themselves .",
    "this gives an intersection diagram : @xmath105 \\ar@{-}[rd ] \\ar@{-}[rrrd ] &   & h_1 b \\ar@{-}[llld ] \\ar@{-}[ld]\\ar@{-}[rd ] & \\\\ h_2 & & h_2 a &   & h_2 a^2 } \\ ] ] this graph makes it clear that , even in such a simple case , it is possible to find loops and circuits within the global action , following an element through a local orbit and within an intersection crossing to the next orbit , eventually getting back to the starting position .",
    "the element @xmath106 multiplied on the left by @xmath107 ends up in @xmath108 , multiplied on the left by @xmath109 yields @xmath110 and so on .",
    "the circuit @xmath111 &   h_1 b \\ar@{>}[r ] & h_2 a^2 \\ar@{>}[r ] & h_1 \\ar@{>}[r ] & h_2\\\\ i \\ar@{>}[r]^{b\\times } & b \\ar@{>}[r]^{a\\times } & ab \\ar@{>}[r]^{b\\times } & bab \\ar@{>}[r]^{a\\times } & abab = 1 } \\ ] ] relates the structure of the single domain global action with the combinatorial information encoded in the presentation .",
    "this will be examined in more detail later .",
    "morphisms between global actions come in various strengths depending on what part of the data is preserved .",
    "preservation of just the local orbit information corresponds to a `` morphism '' , compatibility with the whole of the data then yields a `` regular morphism '' .",
    "first we introduce a subsidiary notion which will be important at several points in the later development .",
    "let @xmath28 be a global action .",
    "let @xmath112 be some point in a local set of @xmath28 .",
    "a _ local frame _ at @xmath113 in @xmath13 or @xmath13__-frame _ _ at @xmath113 is a sequence @xmath114 of points in the local orbit of the @xmath33-action on @xmath115 determined by @xmath113 .",
    "thus for each @xmath116 , @xmath117 , there is some @xmath118 with @xmath119 .",
    "note that in extreme cases , such as a trivial action , all the @xmath120 may be equal , but if the action is faithful , each @xmath13-frame at @xmath113 consists essentially of @xmath113 and a sequence @xmath121 of elements of @xmath33 . for some of the homotopy theoretic side of the development",
    "this may be of use as @xmath122 yields a @xmath123-simplex in the nerve of the group @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath124 are global actions , a _ morphism _",
    "@xmath125 of global actions is a function @xmath126 on their underlying sets , which preserves local frames .",
    "more precisely : + if @xmath127 is an @xmath13-frame at @xmath128 for some @xmath61 then @xmath129 is a @xmath130-frame at @xmath131 for some @xmath132 .",
    "note that not all @xmath13-frames may lead to the same @xmath130 , so this notion is _ not _ saying that the whole of the local orbit of the @xmath33-action corresponding to @xmath128 must end up within a single local orbit , merely that given @xmath127 , there is some @xmath130 such that @xmath129 form a @xmath130-frame .",
    "this is of course only significant when there are infinitely many co - ordinates , as larger frames may lead to different `` larger '' @xmath130s .",
    "intuitively a _ path _ in a global action @xmath28 is a sequence of points @xmath133 in @xmath44 so that each @xmath134 is a @xmath13-frame for some ( varying ) @xmath135 .",
    "this idea can be captured using a morphism from a global action model of a line , and this is done in the initial papers on global actions , @xcite . here",
    "we postpone this until the third section as there is a certain technical advantage in considering the line with a groupoid atlas structure and that will be introduced there .    a _ regular morphism _",

    "if @xmath145 is a regular morphism , it is clear that @xmath146 preserves local frames and so is a morphism in the weaker sense .",
    "composition of both types of morphism is defined in the obvious way and so one obtains categories of global actions and morphisms and of global actions and regular morphisms .",
    "it is perhaps necessary to underline the meaning of a morphism of group actions : if @xmath147 and @xmath148 are group actions of @xmath10 on @xmath14 and @xmath94 on @xmath149 , respectively , a morphism from @xmath147 to @xmath148 is a pair @xmath150 with @xmath151 a homomorphism and @xmath152 a function such that for @xmath153 , @xmath154 we need to note that , if @xmath113 and @xmath155 are in the same orbit of @xmath156 then @xmath157 and @xmath158 are in the same orbit of @xmath148 .",

    "it also preserves identities and composition as is easily checked .",

    "one has that the automorphism @xmath151 can be realised by a deck transformation and so @xmath578 and @xmath579 are isomorphic .    if @xmath580 is trivial ( i.e. the covering global action is simply connected ) then @xmath581 , i.e. @xmath569 is a universal covering.@xmath538      to complete the triple description of @xmath582 , we need to show that a simply connected covering exists .",

    "clearly @xmath616 , @xmath598 is a global action and @xmath617 a regular morphism of global actions .",

    "we thus have    the induced homomorphism @xmath647 is a monomorphism with image , @xmath94 .",
    "the proof is by direct calculation using the explicitly defined lifts of paths and homotopies .",
    "much of the above would work for strong paths , but the proof that the strong version of @xmath648 is a covering would seem to depend on a local condition which is in some way analogous to `` semi locally simply connected '' .",

    "adapt the above discussion to handle strong coverings and /or groupoid atlases .",
    "to summarise :    given @xmath650 connected , and @xmath640 then there is a connected covering space @xmath648 with @xmath651 in particular corresponding to @xmath652 , the trivial subgroup of @xmath362 , one has a simply connected covering space @xmath653 @xmath654    of course by an earlier result @xmath655 .",

    "any @xmath10-set @xmath14 can be decomposed as a disjoint union of `` connected '' @xmath10-sets . here",

    "it is then more or less routine to check that @xmath660 is an equivalence of categories .",

    "@xmath661 , 3 .",
    "@xmath662 and thus the group @xmath10 in the above equivalence .",
    "in this section we will examine general single domain global actions and their coverings .",
    "suppose @xmath664 is a single domain global action .",
    "we thus have that @xmath30 is a set with a reflexive relation @xmath9 defined on it , then @xmath665 can be considered as a ( generalised ) functor and we can form its colimit @xmath666 .",

    "if @xmath94 is any subgroup of @xmath10 , we can form a quotient global action @xmath673 with @xmath674 , the set of right cosets @xmath675 , etc , so @xmath673 is again a single domain global action .",
    "it is clear that @xmath676    any connected single domain global action is regularly isomorphic to some @xmath673 .",
    "let @xmath28 be a connected single domain global action and let @xmath677 be a chosen basepoint .",

    "the possible ambiguities in the word are due to cases of @xmath34 and the compatibility condition ensures this does not matter .",
    "since @xmath685 gets sent to @xmath686 , this defines a regular morphism of global actions .",
    "let @xmath687 , which is the stabiliser of @xmath313 in @xmath678 .",
    "clearly @xmath688    the only difference therefore between single domain global actions of the form @xmath689",
    "as introduced in section [ agkh ] and the general case is that the @xmath58 may not be subgroups and may have interrelations between them .    1 .",
    "as before take @xmath690 , @xmath691 , @xmath692 to get @xmath693 .",
    "then the colimit group is @xmath694 and , of course , the stabiliser of 1 in @xmath678 is merely @xmath695 , that is @xmath696 .",
    "the quotient map @xmath697 is that with kernel the normal closure of @xmath698 and writing @xmath0 for that kernel ( and thus for @xmath699 ) , we have @xmath700 + a similar picture emerges with the other examples",
    ". 2 .   for @xmath701 ,",
    "the colimit group is @xmath702 and the stabiliser is the normal closure of @xmath703 .",
    "this normal subgroup has rank 3 .",
    "thus @xmath704 has a second description as @xmath705 , where @xmath706 , these subgroups being here subgroups of @xmath707 , not of @xmath708 . of course ,",
    "the only change for @xmath710 is that the colimit group is @xmath711 , the free product with amalgamation .",
    "4 .   taking @xmath712 again , but with presentation @xmath713 @xmath714 , @xmath715 , gives colimit group @xmath716 .",
    "the stabiliser of 1 / fundamental group is free on @xmath717 .",
    "we again get a second description as a ` relative ' @xmath718 .",
    "5 .   for our final example",
    ", @xmath719 with presentation @xmath720 is @xmath719 itself and the given description is the one we have found earlier through the general process .",
    "if @xmath721 as above then for @xmath722 , its universal or simply connected covering , @xmath722 is also a single domain global action and as the diagram @xmath723 , @xmath724 clearly there is a diagram @xmath725 \\ar@{>}[r]^{\\quad\\cong } & \\tilde \\a \\ar@{>}[d]\\\\ \\mathsf{g}_\\a/{h_\\a } \\ar@{>}[r]^{\\quad\\cong } & \\a } \\ ] ] so @xmath726 .",
    "it remains to relate @xmath727 more closely to @xmath728 .    if @xmath729 , then set @xmath730 .",
    "let @xmath731 and let @xmath732 .",
    "then @xmath733 and is minimal .",
    "of course @xmath734 and @xmath735 .",
    "thus as a corollary of the main classification theorem for coverings we get :    general connected coverings of @xmath28 correspond bijectively to intermediate groups between @xmath727 and @xmath728 .    if @xmath736 is not trivial , i.e. @xmath28 is not connected , then it is important to remember that @xmath737 only covers the connected component of the basepoint .",
    "again we turn to our examples to see what these results give there .    in each case",
    "we have a description of @xmath28 as @xmath738 and as our initial situation had @xmath739 where @xmath10 is the colimit group of the original system , we have @xmath740 in each case .",
    "this implies that @xmath741 is trivial .",
    "we could also deduce this from the description of @xmath742 with @xmath743 .",
    "( @xmath744 is normal in @xmath48 so @xmath745 . in each example",
    "this is trivial , so @xmath742 contains the trivial group and hence has that group as its intersection . )",
    "we can describe the simply connected covering of @xmath28 in each case :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath746 , @xmath747 , where as before @xmath748 is to be interpreted _ in context _ as a subgroup of the corresponding group .",
    "@xmath749 , @xmath750 .",
    "@xmath751 , @xmath752 , where @xmath48 has presentation @xmath753    \\4 .",
    "@xmath754 , with @xmath755 with each @xmath58 generated by a transposition , @xmath756    \\5 .",
    "the case @xmath757 with @xmath758 , as above ( example [ s4 ] ) , is already simply connected , so is its own simply connected cover .    in the next section",
    "we examine a more complex example , namely the elementary matrix group , @xmath759 of a ring @xmath4 , which forms the connected component of the identity in the global action @xmath87 .",
    "a particularly important example of a single domain global action is the general linear global action @xmath328 .",
    "we saw , example [ gln ] , that @xmath760 was the set of right cosets of the group @xmath761 modulo the subgroup @xmath759 of elementary matrices and hence was identifiable as being @xmath762 .",
    "we asked `` _ _",
    "is @xmath763 ? _ _ '' it is to this question we now turn .",
    "the usual approach to @xmath765 is via the steinberg group @xmath764 .",
    "we earlier , example [ gln ] , introduced the notation @xmath766 for the elementary matrix with @xmath767 here , of course , @xmath768 , the set of non - diagonal positions in an @xmath769 array .",
    "elementary matrices satisfy certain standard relations and the steinberg group is obtained by considering the group having generators @xmath770 , abstracting the elementary matrices , and having as relations just these standard , almost universal , relations .",
    "more precisely ( and a standard reference is milnor s notes , @xcite ) , @xmath764 is given by generators @xmath770 , @xmath771 , @xmath772 , @xmath773 , which are subject to the relations :              we will construct a global action analoguous to @xmath781 but for this we need to understand @xmath87 better . early in this paper ,  [ gln ] , p. , we introduced the elementary matrix groups , @xmath782 . recall that we let @xmath783 be the set of off - diagonal positions in an @xmath769 array and called a subset @xmath66 _ closed _ if it corresponded to a transitive relation , i.e. if @xmath784 and @xmath785 , then @xmath786 .",
    "the general linear global action @xmath87 then had coordinate system @xmath54 , the set of closed subsets of @xmath783 ordered by inclusion .",
    "the underlying set of @xmath87 was the general linear group @xmath787 and for @xmath78 , @xmath788 was the group of elementary matrices generated by the @xmath789 with @xmath790 .",
    "clearly this single domain global action is of the form @xmath791 . to form its",
    "connected covering ( which will cover the connected component of 1 , that is , will cover the sub - global action , @xmath759 , determined by the elementary matrices ) , we need to take the colimit of the @xmath788 . clearly to examine this colimit we need to see what the maximal elements of @xmath54 are , and to examine the corresponding @xmath788 .",
    "transitivity follows from closedness . if @xmath790 , then @xmath793 , since no diagonal elements are in @xmath13 , but as @xmath13 is maximal , one or other of @xmath794 and @xmath795 must be in @xmath13 - otherwise we could add it in !          it is known ( cf .",
    "milnor s notes @xcite ) that @xmath796 has a presentation given by the @xmath802 , with @xmath803 , and with the steinberg relation ( restricted to those indices @xmath804 with @xmath805 ) between them .",
    "let @xmath806 be the group given by generators @xmath802 with @xmath790 and with the corresponding steinberg relations , then @xmath807 so if we define a global action as below , it will be connected .",
    "the isomorphism @xmath810 for maximal @xmath13 together with the fact that @xmath811 for @xmath812 gives that there is an isomorphism @xmath813 for maximal @xmath13 compatible with the inclusions into @xmath764 and @xmath761 and the homomorphism @xmath151 introduced earlier .",
    "two maximal @xmath13 can be linked with each other by a zig - zag where intermediate maximal elements ( total orders ) differ by the transposition of two elements only .",
    "the corresponding isomorphisms @xmath814 agree on intersections of the corresponding groups thus giving an isomorphism @xmath815 the resulting map is then easily shown to be @xmath151 .",
    "it remains to analyse this map a little more .",
    "the kernel , @xmath816 is central ( again see milnor s notes ) , hence @xmath817as no element of @xmath818 vanishes when mapped into @xmath819 as the mapping is an inclusion .",
