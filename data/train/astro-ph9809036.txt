    "there is a convincing body of evidence that most of the optical light emitted by accretion discs in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) is due to reprocessed x - rays illuminating the disc surface @xcite .",
    "van paradijs pointed out that this irradiation , observed both in steady lmxbs and during the outburst phases of lmxb transient sources ( `` soft x - ray transients '' , sxts ) should influence the stability properties of accretion discs in such systems .",
    "x - ray irradiation increases the surface ( and therefore the central ) disc temperature and could , in principle , prevent the growth of the thermal instability that appears at a temperature for which hydrogen becomes partially ionized .",
    "this instability leads , under certain conditions , to a global thermal - viscous instability which is taken to be responsible for dwarf nova outbursts and sxt events ( see e.g. cannizzo 1993 ) .",
    "models used to describe x - ray irradiated discs are often , as we show below , inconsistent and/or assume unverified hypotheses . despite these drawbacks , results obtained in such studies seem to be in agreement with observations . in the present work ,",
    "we construct self - consistent models of irradiated disc vertical structures and show what should be modified in the usual treatment to account for observations whilst being consistent .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section 2 we rediscuss the basics of irradiated disc models . in section 3",
    "we present self - consistent models of irradiated disks and discuss their stability .",
    "in most studies of x - ray illuminated accretion discs in close binary systems it is assumed ( explicitly or implicitly ) that the disc is isothermal in regions in which reprocessed light is an important part of the disc emission ( see e.g. vrtilek et al . ,",
    "for example , de jong , van paradijs & augusteijn use the vrtilek et al . (",
    "1990 ) model to deduce various properties of x - ray irradiated discs in lmxbs , such as the albedo and the disc opening angle .",
    "it is sometimes said that the values obtained in this way are suggested by observations , and they are used even in the case were it is stated that the disc is not isothermal @xcite . to justify the assumption of an isothermal disc it is argued that if the irradiating flux is larger than the flux due to viscous dissipation in the disc , the viscous heating term can be neglected in the energy equation so that the central temperature is equal to the irradiation temperature .",
    "this reasoning is , in general , erroneous : irradiation dominates the internal disc structure only if the irradiation flux _ divided by the disc total optical depth _ is larger than the flux due to viscous dissipation @xcite .",
    "this is a simple consequence of energy conservation and of the radiative transfer equation and is independent of the details of disc models .",
    "since there seems to be some confusion about this point , we shall derive the relation between disc midplane and surface temperatures from the basic equations .",
    "since we are interested here in stable and therefore hot accretion discs , the convective energy transport does not play an important role ( even though it is taken into account in the numerical model described in section 3.1 ) .",
    "we write the energy conservation as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vertical ( in the @xmath2 direction ) radiative flux and @xmath3 is the viscous heating rate per unit volume ( @xmath4 is the radius ) .",
    "( [ energy1 ] ) states that an accretion disc is not in radiative equilibrium , contrary to a stellar atmosphere . for this equation to be solved ,",
    "the function @xmath3 must be known . of course , despite many efforts and recent progress in understanding the origin of viscosity in accretion discs ( see e.g. zahn 1991 ;",
    "balbus & hawley 1998 ) the function @xmath5 is largely unknown .",
    "the _ ansatz _",
    "most widely used in practical applications is based on the `` @xmath6 - viscosity '' prescription @xcite according to which the kinematic viscosity coefficient can be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is the viscosity parameter ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the keplerian angular frequency and @xmath10 is the sound speed , @xmath11 the density , and @xmath12 the total pressure .",
    "the viscous dissipation can thereafter be written as ( e.g. smak 1984 ) @xmath13 viscous heating of this form has important implications for the structure of optically thin layers of accretion discs and may lead to the creation of coronae and winds ( shaviv & wehrse 1986 ; 1991 ) . here , however , we are interested in the effects of irradiation on the inner structure of an optically thick disc , so the precise form of the viscous heating is not important , as can be seen by comparing our results with those of hubeny .    when integrated over @xmath2 , the rhs of eq .",

    "( 2 ) is equal to viscous dissipation per unit surface : @xmath14 which is close , but not exactly equal , to the surface heating term @xmath15 generally used in the literature .",
    "the difference between the two expressions may be important in numerical calculation @xcite but in the present context is of no importance .",
    "one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ energy1 ] ) as @xmath16 where we introduced a new variable , the optical depth @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the rosseland mean opacity and @xmath19 is the total optical depth . @xmath20 is given by : @xmath21 as @xmath11 decreases approximately exponentially , @xmath20 is the ratio of two rather well defined scale heights , the pressure and the opacity scale heights , which are comparable , so that @xmath22 is of order of unity .    at the disc midplane , by symmetry",
    ", the flux must vanish : @xmath23 , whereas at the surface , ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 equation ( [ fsurface ] ) states that the total flux at the surface is equal to the energy dissipated by viscosity ( per unit time and unit surface ) .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ energy2 ] ) is thus @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "given that @xmath22 is of order of unity , putting @xmath28 is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the precise form of @xmath20 is more complex , and is given by the functional dependence of the opacities on density and temperature ; it is of no importance in this illustrative section which gives the physical basis for understanding the exact numerical results that will be given in the following sections .",
    "we thus take : @xmath29    to obtain the temperature stratification one has to solve the transfer equation . here",
    "we use the diffusion approximation @xmath30 appropriate for the optically thick discs we are dealing with .",
    "the integration of eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) is straightforward and gives : @xmath31    the upper ( surface ) boundary condition is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the irradiation temperature , which depends on @xmath4 , the albedo , the height at which the energy is deposited and on the shape of the disc ( see eq .",
    "[ tirr ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ bcond2 ] ) @xmath34 corresponds to the _ emergent _ flux and , as mentioned above , @xmath35 corresponds to the _ total _ flux ( see e.g. hubeny 1991 ) which explains the factor 1/2 in eq ( [ bcond2 ] ) .",
    "the temperature stratification is thus : @xmath36 + t^4_{\\rm irr }   \\label{t2}\\ ] ] which is very similar to the formula obtained by hubeny for a different viscosity prescription .",

    "the difference between the two criteria is important in lmxbs since , for parameters of interest , @xmath41 in the outer disc regions . in section 3.1",
    "we use self - consistent detailed vertical disc structure calculations in order to determine the influence of irradiation on the inner disc structure . note",
    "that we neglect here the possible presence of an x - ray irradiation generated corona and wind , described by idan & shaviv .",
    "condition ( [ c1 ] ) is _ not _ however a necessary condition for the disc _ emission properties _ to be dominated by irradiation .",
    "it is enough that @xmath42 for the disc observed luminosity to be dominated by reprocessed emission .",
    "observations suggest @xcite that the absolute visual magnitude m@xmath43 of nova - like cataclysmic variables which are accreting at rates @xmath44 g s@xmath45 @xcite are roughly two magnitudes fainter than the m@xmath46 s of lmxbs of similar size ( since one has to compare luminosities and not fluxes one should compare systems with the same emitting areas ) .",
    "this would imply @xmath47 so that , although the optical emission is dominated by reprocessed x - ray radiation , the inner disc structure is not dominated by irradiation ( eq . 13 ) .    for a point source",
    ", the irradiation temperature can be written as @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the efficiency of converting accretion power into x - rays , @xmath50 is the x - ray albedo and @xmath51 is the local height at which irradiation energy is deposited , or the height of the disc  as seen by x - rays \" .",

    "it is easy to see that the value 0.2 can not be the pressure scale - height to radius ratio since this would imply temperatures @xmath59 k at the outer disc radius . in addition , the value @xmath60 was obtained by modeling two dipping sources in which the accreting object is a neutron star .",
    "it is not at all obvious that this value applies to all lmxbs .",
    "de jong et al . also deduced a high value for the x - ray albedo @xmath61 , although they discussed possible lower values for this parameter .",
    "equation ( [ tirr ] ) has been extensively used in recent work on disc stability properties in lmxbs .",
    "van paradijs suggested that x - ray illumination might modify the conditions under which accretion disks undergo dwarf novae type thermal - viscous instabilities .",
    "king and collaborators , @xcite have considered different implications of this idea on the evolution of various classes of lmxbs .",
    "all these models used eq .",
    "( [ tirr ] ) with @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "since the stability criterion applies to the outer disc radius the value 0.2 is assumed for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in king",
    "et al . , the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ tirr ] ) is multiplied by @xmath66 for black hole lmxbs , supposedly to account for the non - point source character of the x - ray emitter in this case @xcite .",
    "the new stability criterion proposed by van paradijs seems to correspond quite well to observed properties of lmxbs in the sense that most sources that should be stable according to this criterion are more or less steady and all transient sources are unstable .",
    "this new criterion is a sufficient condition for disc stability ( or necessary for instability ) .",
    "the problem is that it is based on a model which can not represent the discs to which it is applied .",
    "the isothermal disc model gives an incorrect description of x - ray irradiated discs in lmxbs .",
    "it is often argued that this is just a simple disc model .",
    "this is true .",
    "unfortunately , like many other simple models , it does not apply to x - ray irradiated discs in lmxbs .",
    "it assumes , contrary to observed properties of accretion discs in lmxbs , that the irradiation temperature is equal to the midplane disc temperature .",
    "the midplane temperature at which a hot , steady , accretion disk becomes unstable is ( this corresponds to the minimum surface density for hot stable discs , @xmath67 ) @xmath68 which for standard parameters ( @xmath69 ) is close to 30 000 k. eq .",

    ", x - ray irradiation does not have to dominate the vertical structure to play an important role in the disc properties .",
    "also , as pointed out by king & ritter , x - ray irradiation may affect the temporal behaviour of transient lmxb outbursts .",
    "it is instructive to see how irradiation modifies disc stability properties .",
    "the effective temperature at which a hot disc becomes thermally unstable is , according to h98 , given by @xmath70 for parameters of interest , this leads to @xmath71 ( see eq .",
    "16 ) and , as mentioned above , the vertical disc structure can then only be changed for very high irradiation fluxes .",
    "much lower fluxes , however , are sufficient to modify its thermal stability properties , as will be shown in the next sections .",

    "the thermal instability is due to a rapid change of opacities with temperature when hydrogen begins to recombine . at high temperatures @xmath75 . in the instability region ,",

    "these types of irradiation can be summarized in a parameter for which we have few theoretical constraints ; in view of the uncertainties in the models , observations will bring important constraints to this problem .",

    "<S> we calculate self - consistent models of x - ray irradiated accretion discs in close binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a point x - ray source powered by accretion and located in the disc plane can not modify the disc structure , mainly because of the self - screening by the disc of its outer regions . </S>",
    "<S> since observations show that the emission of the outer disc regions in low mass x - ray binaries is dominated by the reprocessed x - ray flux , accretion discs in these systems must be either warped or irradiated by a source above the disc plane , or both . </S>",
