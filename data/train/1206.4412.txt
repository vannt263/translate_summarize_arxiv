    "in quantum state discrimination we want to determine the actual state of a quantum system that is known to be in a certain state belonging to a given set of states .",
    "this is an essential problem for many tasks in quantum communication and quantum cryptography .",
    "since nonorthogonal quantum states can not be distinguished perfectly , various optimized discrimination strategies have been developed .",
    "the best known of these are minimum - error discrimination @xcite and optimum unambiguous discrimination , where the latter strategy was originally derived for pure states @xcite and later also considered for mixed states @xcite . in unambiguous discrimination errors do not occur , that is , the total error rate @xmath1 is required to vanish , @xmath2 .",
    "this can be achieved at the expense of admitting inconclusive results , where the measurement fails to give a definite answer .",
    "optimum unambiguous discrimination minimizes this failure probability , or failure rate , @xmath3 , yielding the minimum value @xmath4 .",
    "unambiguous state discrimination is not possible for pure states that are linearly dependent @xcite , or for mixed states described by density operators with identical supports @xcite , where the support is the hilbert space spanned by the eigenvectors with non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "when unambiguous discrimination is impossible , related measurements can be applied , which discriminate the states with maximum possible confidence for each conclusive outcome @xcite .",
    "optimized maximum - confidence discrimination is achieved by the particular one of these measurements that minimizes the failure probability @xcite .",
    "this measurement corresponds to optimum unambiguous discrimination when for each of the different conclusive results the maximum confidence is equal to unity .",
    "while the confidence is defined separately for each conclusive outcome , in minimum - error discrimination the overall error rate @xmath1 , averaged over all outcomes , is minimized . in this strategy inconclusive results are not allowed , that is , @xmath5 .",
    "chefles and barnett @xcite introduced a more general strategy that minimizes @xmath1 when a certain fixed rate @xmath3 of inconclusive results is admitted , thus reducing the minimum achievable value of @xmath1 . for discriminating two equiprobable nonorthogonal pure states these authors obtained the optimum solution , which interpolates between minimum - error discrimination and optimum unambiguous discrimination when the fixed rate @xmath3 grows from @xmath5 to @xmath4 .",
    "their research triggered further investigations @xcite .",
    "in particular , optimum state discrimination with a fixed rate @xmath3 of inconclusive results was extended to mixed states @xcite , and the relation to the strategy of maximum - confidence discrimination was briefly discussed in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "clearly , in a measurement where @xmath3 is fixed , minimizing @xmath1 corresponds to maximizing the overall rate of correct results , @xmath6 .",
    "fiurek and jeek @xcite derived general operator conditions that have to be fulfilled in the optimum measurement with an arbitrary fixed value @xmath3 , holding for the discrimination of an arbitrary number @xmath0 of mixed states .",
    "for @xmath7 they solved the optimization problem in the special case of two mixed qubit that have the same purity and occur with equal prior probabilities @xcite , which includes the solution for two equiprobable pure states @xcite .",
    "other solutions were not obtained .",
    "recently optimum state discrimination has been also investigated for a measurement where a certain fixed error rate @xmath1 is admitted @xcite . with a fixed rate of @xmath1 , maximizing the rate of correct results",
    "@xmath6 corresponds to minimizing the failure rate @xmath3 .",
    "the optimum measurement in this strategy was studied for the discrimination of two states , @xmath7 , where the solution was derived for two pure states occurring with arbitrary prior probabilities @xcite .",
    "however , it was not recognized that there exists a relation between optimum state discrimination with a fixed value of @xmath3 , on the one hand , and with a fixed value of @xmath1 , on the other hand .",
    "this relation implies that by completely solving the optimization problem for one of these two discrimination strategies one can also obtain the solution for the other strategy , as will be shown in the present paper .",
    "the purpose of our paper is twofold .",
    "first , for optimum state discrimination with a fixed rate of @xmath3 we derive analytical solutions going beyond the solutions obtained so far @xcite , and we also outline the relation to maximum - confidence discrimination , extending our previous discussions @xcite .",
    "second , we show that when the maximum rate of correct results @xmath6 is known as a function of the fixed failure probability @xmath3 , then from this function one can also obtain the maximum rate of correct results in dependence of a fixed error rate @xmath1 , and vice versa , due to a general relation between the solutions of the two optimized strategies that holds for the discrimination of an arbitrary number @xmath0 of mixed states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we begin in sec .",
    "ii with an alternative derivation of the optimality conditions for state discrimination with fixed @xmath3 , and with establishing the relation to maximum - confidence discrimination . in sec .",
    "iii together with appendix a we apply these conditions to the discrimination of two mixed qubit states occurring with arbitrary prior probabilities , while sec .",
    "iv together with appendix b is devoted to the discrimination of @xmath0 symmetric states . in sec .",
    "v we consider a case where the density operators resolve the identity operator , and we also specify the optimality conditions for a case of partially symmetric states .",
    "the general relation between the two optimization strategies where either @xmath1 or @xmath3 has a fixed value is presented in sec .",
    "vi , together with an example . sec .",
    "vii provides a summary of results and concludes the paper .",
    "we suppose that a quantum system is prepared with the prior probability @xmath8 in one of @xmath0 given states described by the density operators @xmath9 @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "the general task is to perform a discrimination measurement in order to infer in which of the @xmath0 possible states the system was prepared .",
    "the measurement is described by @xmath12 positive detection operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the conditional probability that a system is inferred to be in the state @xmath9 given it had been prepared in the state @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is the conditional probability that in this case an inconclusive result is obtained and the measurement fails to discriminate the states .",
    "the detection operators fulfill the completeness relation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the identity operator in the @xmath20-dimensional hilbert space @xmath21 spanned by the eigenstates of the operators @xmath22 that belong to nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "unless each of the detection operators is a projector , the measurement is a generalized one .",
    "once the detection operators are known , implementations of the generalized measurement as a projective measurement in an enlarged hilbert space can be obtained using standard methods @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the specific discrimination measurement where the overall failure probability @xmath23 has a given fixed value @xmath24 , while the overall probability of getting correct results , @xmath6 , is as large as possible . here",
    "we defined the total density operator @xmath25 , which has its support in the full hilbert space @xmath21 and is thus an operator of rank @xmath20 .",
    "our optimization problem can be expressed as follows : @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ primal1 ] ) we introduced the overall error probability @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath3 is fixed , the maximum of the absolute rate of correct results , @xmath6 , determines also the maximum of the relative rate of correct results at the same value of @xmath3 , defined as @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we thus get @xmath28 in the special case where @xmath29 errors do not occur and the states are unambiguously discriminated .    as will be shown in sec .",

    "the optimum measurement resulting from eqs .",
    "( [ primal1 ] ) and ( [ qprimal1a ] ) with @xmath32 then yields a maximum of @xmath6 that is smaller than @xmath33 and is therefore without practical relevance",
    ". one could modify the optimization problem and ask for the maximum of @xmath6 under the constraint that @xmath3 does not exceed a certain fixed margin , @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath6 under this modified constraint then follows from the solution of the original maximization problem , eqs .",

    "( [ primal1 ] ) and ( [ qprimal1a ] ) we use the operator conditions @xcite that have to be fulfilled in the optimum measurement .",
    "let us begin by re - deriving these optimality conditions .",
    "for this purpose we introduce a hermitian operator @xmath38 and a scalar real amplifier @xmath39 . due to the two constraints in eq .",
