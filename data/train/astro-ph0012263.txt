    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close interacting binary system consisting of a main sequence star ( the secondary ) and a white dwarf . the roche - lobe filling secondary loses matter via the inner lagrangian point to the primary .",
    "if the magnetic field of the white dwarf is negligible , then angular momentum conservation drives the matter from the secondary into an accretion disc around the primary component .",
    "this disc matter is maintained by a steady mass stream from the secondary , which hits the disc in the so - called bright spot .",
    "some of these systems undergo frequently an outburst , in which the system brightens for a short period of time ( a few days ) in comparison to the interval between such eruptions ( few weeks to months ) .",
    "it is believed that the accretion disc follows a disc instability cycle @xcite in which the hydrogen in the disc switches its ionization status .",
    "other systems , the so - called nova - like variables , appear to be in a permanent outburst state and are believed to exhibit optically thick , steady state discs .",
    "quiescent disc , in contrast , show line emission , mainly of hydrogen and are therefore at least partially optically thin . an extensive overview over the theoretical and observational aspects of cvs",
    "is given in warner @xcite .",
    "the ultimate wish of any astronomers is probably to be able to see the stars from close by , to get a direct image of the stellar systems .",
    "tomographic methods give us a unique opportunity to get such a picture , even if indirect , without getting close to the object . by making use of the eclipse light curve ,",
    "the classical eclipse mapping technique ( em , @xcite ) provides us with images of the accretion disc , while physical parameter eclipse mapping ( ppem ,  @xcite ) give us some insight into the accretion physics .",
    "this paper gives an introduction to ppem and summaries applications of this method to multi - colour light curves of five different cataclysmic variables .",
    "]    figure  [ fig_cvmovie ] illustrates the varying viewing angle a high inclination cv undergoes during an eclipse .",
    "one can see that at any one time during eclipse , only part of the accretion disc is occulted by the secondary .",
    "the flux at the given orbital phase is the total of all emission of any material not eclipsed at this phase .",
    "any local intensity maximum in the accretion disc , e.g.  the bright spot , will be eclipsed and reappears at a characteristic orbital phase and causes thereby a pair of steep gradients or steps in the observed eclipse light curve , one in ingress and the other in egress . depending on the spatial location of this spot , the pair of steps will be shifted in relation to phase 0 which is defined as the conjunction of the white dwarf .    in em one",
    "takes advantage of this spatial information of the intensity distribution of the accretion disc hidden in the eclipse profile .",
    "we have to make three basic assumptions : ( a ) the geometry of the secondary is known ( it is usually a good approximation to assume it fills its roche lobe ) ; ( b ) the geometry of the disc is known ( in the simplest approximation we use a geometrically infinitisimally thin disc ) ; ( c ) the disc emission does not vary with time ( this can be achieved by using averaged eclipse profiles in order to reduce the amount of flickering and flares from the disc ) . by fitting the eclipse light curve , we reconstruct the intensity distribution using a maximum entropy method ( mem , @xcite ) .",
    "the mem algorithm allows one to choose the simplest solution still compatible with the data in this otherwise ill - conditioned back projection problem .",
    "further details of the em method can be found in horne @xcite or baptista & steiner @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of this method is extensively described by r. baptista in these proceedings .    ]",
    "the ppem approach goes a step further in that we map physical parameters , like temperature @xmath0 and surface density @xmath1 , instead of intensities .",
    "figure  [ fig_ppem ] explains the method by means of a flowchart diagram .",
    "in addition to the three above mentioned basic assumptions ( indicated by the right upper panel ) we have to presuppose a spectral model for the disc emission ( indicated as `` model '' in the chart ) , relating the parameters to be mapped ( e.g.  @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) to the radiated intensity in a given filter ( e.g.  @xmath2 ) . the model can be as simple as a pure black body spectrum , the ppem is then called _ temperature mapping _ or as complicated as non - linear lte disc model atmospheres as calculated by hubeny @xcite .",
    "two simple model spectra are described in sect .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the predicted multi - colour light curves are then compared to the observed ones .",
    "as long as the fit is not satisfactory , the parameter maps are varied according to the mem algorithm ( i.e.using gradients @xmath3 ( and @xmath4 ) ) .",
    "as soon as the @xmath5 that was aimed for is reached ( and the maps have converged , see @xcite ) the maps @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) can be further analysed and compared to current disc models ( see sect .",
    "[ expect ] ) .",
    "the ppem method requires input in the form of light curves",
    ". the number of light curves in various wavelength regions ( filters / passbands ) necessary to calculate a reliable parameter map depends on the used spectral model ( see following sect .  [ model ] ) and must be equal to or greater than the number of parameters to be mapped .",
    "for example , if one uses a black body spectrum to map the temperature ( see sect .",
    "[ ippeg ] or [ vzscl ] ) , one light curve would be sufficient for a unique ppem analysis .",
    "however , the more light curves ( in various filters ) one uses the better : the long wavelength data ( e.g.  ir light curves ) will be ideal to determine low temperature ( outer ) regimes in the disc , while the short wavelength data ( e.g.  uv light curves ) will be most appropriate to map the hot ( inner ) disc regions .",
    "if one uses an appropriate spectral model , such as calculated by hubeny  @xcite , spectrophotometry can be analysed .",
    "ppem ideally allows to extract a maximum of the information content of the data .",
    "the spectral model provides a relation between the mapped parameter(s ) @xmath6 and the intensity @xmath7 at the frequency @xmath8 .",
    "if one would set @xmath9 , this simply reduces ppem to em . in the simplest true ppem version we use a black body spectrum for the spectral model , i.e. @xmath10 which can be used to map the parameter temperature @xmath0 in the disc . here",
    "@xmath11 is the speed of light , @xmath12 planck and @xmath13 boltzmann constant . using this model",
    "we assume that the disc radiates optically thick .",
    "this option of the ppem method is called _ temperature mapping _ and is useful for accretion discs in novae , nova - like variables and outbursting dwarf novae .    in order to allow the disc to be optically thin , as we expect in quiescent dwarf novae",
    ", we introduce a second parameter .",
    "we have some freedom in the choice , but since theoretical studies e.g.  of the outburst behaviour use the surface density @xmath1 in the disc , we use the same . the next simple model",
    "thus is calculated as : @xmath14 with the optical depth @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass absorption coefficient , @xmath17 the mass density @xmath18 and @xmath19 the disc scale height @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the radius , @xmath22 is the local sound speed and @xmath23 the keplerian velocity of the disc material , with @xmath24 the mean molecular weight , @xmath25 the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath26 the gravitational constant and @xmath27 the mass of the white dwarf .    in our studies",
    "we used a pure hydrogen slab in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) including only bound - free and free - free h and h@xmath28 emission .",
    "even though this model is very simple it still is very useful in that it allows us to distinguish between optically thin and thick regions of the disc .",
    "the eclipse mapping of dwarf nova discs and the presence of emision lines suggest that at least part of the quiescent discs are optically thin .    for the usual range of temperatures and surface densities in cv accretion discs ,",
    "this lte approximation is still relatively good . in more realistic models ( e.g.  models by @xcite )",
    "one would include metals which significantly increase the opacity at temperatures lower than about @xmath29k leading to lower intensities than determined by our @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , using our simple model , our algorithm overestimates the temperatures ( and if optically thin also the surface density ) in the cooler parts of the disc , in order to meet the required intensities .",
    "this will only be important in the outer regions of the disc with temperatures below @xmath31 .",
    "for the white dwarf emission we used white dwarf spectra for the temperature range 10000  k to 30000  k. outside this range black body spectra are used .",
    "the white dwarf is assumed as a spherical object in terms of occultation of the accretion disc and eclipse by the secondary , but it is attributed only a single temperature . since the absorption lines partly coincide with the mean wavelengths of the filters , pass band response functions are used .",
    "usually , the lower hemisphere of the white dwarf is assumed to be obscured by the inner disc .      in the present studies the accretion disc",
    "is assumed to be infinitesimally thin . onto this disc",
    "we constructed a two - dimensional grid of pixel .",
    "this grid consists of rings cut into a number of pixel that provides equal areas for all pixel @xcite . for reference of spatial structures in the disc ,",
    "we use radius and azimuth .",
    "the radius is used in units of the distance between the white dwarf and the inner lagrangian point @xmath32 , the white dwarf being at the origin .",
    "the second coordinate is the azimuth , the angle as seen from the white dwarf and counting from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "azimuth 0 points towards the secondary , the leading lune of the disc has positive and the following lune negative azimuth angles .      apart from the disc emission we allow for another emission component that is never eclipsed , e.g.  the secondary .",
    "however , we do not need to specify a geometrical location or a spectral model for this uneclipsed component , but can reconstruct it for each wavelength / pass band independently as a constant flux contribution .",
    "it is usually given in the light curve plots as a solid horizontal line .",
    "the uneclipsed component can then be used to give limits on the secondary or , if its contribution is known , the remaining uneclipsed flux can be analysed .",
    "it can originate in disc regions never eclipsed due to a relatively low inclination angle , or more likely regions at heights @xmath35 above the disc that are never eclipsed by the secondary .      in order to reconstruct sensible physical parameter distributions within the accretion disc , the distance to the system",
    "has to be known . only in some cases",
    ", relatively good estimates could be made using e.g.  the secondary absorption line spectrum or the white dwarf flux .",
    "ppem provides also the option to determine an independent estimate of the distance , using the combined flux of the accretion disc and the white dwarf .",
    "this estimate can either be compared to present estimates ( e.g.  ht cas , uu  aqr ) or give the first opportunity to establish a distance ( e.g.  v2051  oph ) .",
    "the ppem distance estimate is based on the fact that a spectrum with at least 3 wavelength points is not only determined by the temperature and the surface density , but also by the distance .",
    "if the assumed distance is smaller or larger than the true distance , the fit to the data will be poor . in a multi - pixel analysis like ppem",
    "this might be compensated by neighbouring pixel leading to an overall `` good '' fit to the observed light curve ( expressed as a small @xmath5 ) , but the resulting reconstruction will show artificial structures and the predicted light curve will have kinks not justified by the data .",
    "the amount of structure is expressed as the entropy @xmath36 of the map : the smoother the map the higher the entropy . for each trial distance",
    "@xmath37 we converge the maps to a specific @xmath5 and then plot the parameter @xmath36 against @xmath37 .",
    "where this function peaks , the map shows the least amount of structures and we will ideally find the true distance .    only maps corresponding to fits of equal goodness",
    "can be compared for this distance estimate , since the entropy not only depends on the distance but also on the final @xmath5 .",
    "the lower the @xmath5 , i.e.the better the fit , the more structures will appear in the map , reducing thereby the entropy .",
    "at which @xmath5 to stop has to be determined individually , it depends on the goodness of the spectral model or the amount of flickering in the light curve and is therefore a somewhat subjective measure .    using this distance",
    "estimate one presupposes that the spectral model describes the true emissivity of the disc reasonably well .",
    "it is difficult to determine the error introduced by a wrong model .",
    "a generally good fit to the observed multi - colour eclipse light curves , however , seems to justify the model used .",
    "contours for different parameter combinations of temperature @xmath0 and surface density @xmath1 for a disc radius @xmath38 cm . for each parameter pair",
    "@xmath39 the spectrum @xmath30 was calculated , then the spectra for @xmath40 with small values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the difference in the spectra expressed as the @xmath5 .",
    "contours are drawn for @xmath43 and 1 assuming an error in the spectra of 1% of the maximum value .",
    "the narrower the contour line , the better determined the parameter . [ fig_xi2 ] ]    tests of the ppem method were shown in vrielmann et al.@xcite . in general , the method allows to reconstruct the parameter distributions very well .",
    "however , it depends on the spectral model and the parameter values , how reliable the resulting maps are .",
    "the black body spectrum is a non - linear function of the temperature , but since it gives an unambiguous function @xmath44 it can be used to map the temperature uniquely .",
    "therefore , the _ temperature mapping _",
    "gives very reliable results .",
    "since ppem is using multi - colour light curves we see a huge improvement compared to classical eclipse mapping : steep gradients ( e.g.  at the disc edge ) are much better reproduced in ppem @xcite .    for a @xmath45 model as described in sect .",
    "[ model ] one has to check where in the parameter space the solutions @xmath30 are unique before the maps can be reliably analysed .",
    "for example , in the optically thick limit ( large @xmath1 ) , the surface density can assume any value above a certain limit without a change in the spectrum .",
    "however , the temperature in this case is very well defined . in other regions of the parameter space only the surface density is well defined ( large @xmath0 , small @xmath1 ) , in again other regions both ( intermediate values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) or none ( see the _ banana _ shaped contour lines for small @xmath0 , small @xmath1 in fig.[fig_xi2 ] ) of the parameters can be determined uniquely .",
    "this pattern changes slightly with the disc radius .",
    "figure  [ fig_xi2 ] shows this pattern for a radius of @xmath46 cm .",
    "parameters are most reliable in disc regions that emit the largest intensities . in disc regions with very low intensities",
    "the reconstructed parameters may be influenced by the mem algorithm leading to a smoothing of the spatial gradients .",
    "this is typically the case in the outer disc regions .",
    "such a study can be used to derive error bars for the reconstructed temperature and surface density distribution .",
    "it is usually sufficient to determine these errors for azimuthally averaged maps as an indication for the reliability of the parameter values .",
    "a useful tool to analyse the derived maps is the ratio of the averaged intensity distribution @xmath30 to the black body intensity distribution @xmath47 derived from the temperature alone . in the optically thick case and for very low intensities",
    "this ratio reaches unity .",
    "the reconstructed parameter distributions will allow us to calculate further parameters , like the optical depth , the disc scale height , the effective temperature and mass accretion rate or the viscosity .",
    "these gives us clues about the physics going on in the disc .",
    "what we can expect is described for the reconstructed and a few derived parameters .",
    "the gas temperature is expected to rise towards the disc centre .",
    "close to the white dwarf the disc material is accelerated and the gravitational energy release is strongest . if the accretion disc emits as a black body , the gas temperature is equal to the effective temperature ( see sect .  [ sec_teff ] ) and should decrease radially roughly like @xmath48 . in the optically thin case , the temperature distribution may be much flatter than this .    in case",
    "the disc has a hole , the reconstructed temperature values will decrease towards the disc centre below a value that is undetectable at the wavelengths used .",
    "however , if the hole is very small , mem will lead to a smearing of the values resulting in a flat temperature distribution at small radii .",
    "the literature is divided about the radial behaviour of the surface density . while meyer & meyer - hofmeister s @xcite calculations result in a radially decreasing surface density distribution , ludwig , meyer - hofmeister & ritter @xcite and cannizzo et al .",
    "@xcite derive slightly increasing surface density distributions .    since the critical surface density distributions within the disc instability model show an increase of @xmath49 with radius @xcite we would rather expect that the actual @xmath50 distribution also increases with radius .",
    "this would make it much easier for a disc to undergo an outburst .",
    "note , that if the disc is optically thick , we have no means to determine the surface density , only a lower limit that may be far from the true value .",
    "considering the gravitational energy release and taking into account the slowing down of the disc material at the white dwarf surface , a steady state accretion disc should have the following radial effective temperature distribution @xcite :    @xmath51^{1/4}\\ ] ]    with @xmath52^{1/4}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the radius in the disc , @xmath54 and @xmath27 are the radius and mass of the white dwarf , @xmath26 the gravitational constant , @xmath55 the mass accretion rate of the disc and @xmath56 the stephan - boltzmann constant . for large radii eq .",
    "( [ eq_teff ] ) reduces to @xmath57    deviations from this distribution in real disc show that it is not in steady state .",
    "this can be expected for a quiescent accretion disc of a dwarf nova awaiting the next outburst .",
    "discs in nova - like variables and in outbursting dwarf novae are expected to follow the steady state @xmath58-profile .",
    "the effective temperature distribution can then also be compared to a critical temperature , as e.g.  calculated by ludwig et al .  @xcite .",
    "if the effective temperature distribution falls below this critical value the accretion disc is in the lower branch of the @xmath59 hysteresis curve which is used to explain the disc instability cycle .",
    "such a disc should undergo outbursts .",
    "if the temperatures are above this critical value , the accretion disc is on the hot branch of this hysteresis curve and should therefore be currently in outburst or within a nova - like or nova system .",
    "a further parameter that can be derived is the viscosity @xmath8 , usually parametrized as @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the local sound speed and @xmath19 again the disc scale height ) using shakura & sunyaev s @xcite @xmath62-parameter .",
    "theoretical studies involving the disc instability cycle predict values of @xmath62 around 0.01 in quiescence @xcite .",

    "one possibility is limb brightening of the accretion disc that we did not take into account .",
    "if the disc was flared this effect would even be enhanced .",

    "another possibility is an illumination from a bulge where the ballistic stream hits the accretion disc as described in buckley & tuohy @xcite .",
    "however , this would also make it difficult to explain the ridge in the effective temperature map .",
    "a third explanation is a warp in the disc in such a way that the disc region between the stars is illuminated by the white dwarf at azimuths @xmath101 and the region on the opposite side of the disc ( @xmath102 ) has a bulge so that the outer parts of the disc can not be illuminated by the central object ( for a more detailed explanation see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it would be difficult to explain if it is stable in the rotating frame of the binary .",
    "a ppem analysis of multi - colour light curves from other time periods would be helpful in deciding what causes the _ hot region _ , if its location in the disc is stable , rotates in the disc or is variable in its presence .      instead of dismissing eq .",
    "( [ eq_viscosity ] ) or our ppem analysis altogether , we were seeking for an explanation for the high values of @xmath62 of a few hundreds that we derive for the disc in both ht  cas and v2051  oph .",
    "if we compare our derived surface density values with the values used in the disc instability model @xcite we find that our values are much lower than those necessary for the disc entering the hysteresis curve .",
    "theory predicts values between 10 and 100 g @xmath103  for @xmath62 s between 0.1 and 1 and even at larger @xmath1 s for smaller @xmath62 s . since the disc can not change the @xmath1 from quiescence to outburst that dramatically , this means the outburst can only occur if the disc is very well optically thick already before its onset . on the other hand line emission",
    "is seen during rise and decline of an outburst @xcite .    to solve this problem",
    "we suggest that the disc consists of a cool , optically thick layer carrying most of the matter and which is sandwiched by a hot , optically thin chromosphere .",
    "the surface densities in the underlying disc must be a factor @xmath104 ( @xmath1 a few hundreds ) larger then the reconstructed values to bring the @xmath62 s down to reasonable values of between 0.01 and 0.1 .",
    "however , we only `` see '' the chromosphere , therefore we derive the large values for @xmath62 .",
    "the presence of a hot chromosphere is supported by the excess of blue emission in the uneclipsed component in ht  cas , v2051  oph and uu  aqr .",
    "this emission must come from regions above the disc plane that are never eclipsed , i.e.  a few white dwarf radii .",
    "this means , the chromosphere is an extended layer on top of the disc surface . furthermore",
    ", this chromosphere must be the location where the line emission originates .      in a similar way",
    "as above , the distance problem with ht  cas does not mean we have to dismiss the ppem algorithm right away .",
    "as we have shown , the ppem estimate gives results in agreement with literature values for uu  aqr ( see sect .  [ uuaqr ] ) .",
    "furthermore , our use of literature values for ip  peg and vz  scl does not indicate any disagreement .",
    "instead , we can explain our large discrepancy between our ppem distance estimate and literature values for ht  cas by allowing the disc to be _ patchy _",
    ", i.e.  the emitting surface is smaller then the geometrical surface . using marsh @xcite distance estimate with a recalibrated barnes - evans relation ( for details",
    "see @xcite ) , the covering factor must be of the order @xmath105% .",
    "the patchy disc can be caused by magnetic activity in localized regions on the surface or in the upper layers of the accretion disc .",
    "magnetic flux created by dynamo action and/or the balbous - hawley instabilities driving the viscosity rises out of the cool midplane regions and dissipates most of the viscously generated energy via magnetic reconnection or similar coronal processes .",
    "this model also explains why the energy dissipation rate is proportional to the local orbital frequency @xcite .",
    "our ppem analysis of ht  cas gives an indirect evidence of the hydromagnetic nature of the anomalous viscosity in accretion disks .",
    "we have shown that physical parameter eclipse mapping is a powerful tool that helps us to learn about the physics of accretion discs in cataclysmic variables .",
    "this review can only highlight some interesting results .",
    "but , whether we derive `` just '' an independent distance estimate or get insight into the disc structure , there is always something to learn from the application of this method .",
