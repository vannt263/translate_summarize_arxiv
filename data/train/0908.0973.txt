    "sps includes a combination of linear and quintic loss terms and cubic gain , therefore it is called the cubic - quintic ( cq ) cgl equation .",
    "this equation was introduced ( in the 2d form ) in ref .",

    "then , these solutions were explored in detail by means of numerical methods @xcite .",
    "more general models , such as linearly coupled systems of cq - cgl equations @xcite and the complex swift - hohenberg equation with the cq nonlinearity @xcite , were introduced too .",
    "in addition to the solitons of the nls type , a generic species of solitary waves in conservative media is represented by gap solitons .",
    "they are well known in nonlinear optics , as temporal solitons in fiber bragg gratings , and in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with repulsion between atoms , which are loaded into in optical - lattice trapping potentials .",
    "a fundamental feature , from which the name of the gap soliton derives , is that its wavenumber ( in terms of optical models ) must belong to a finite bandgap induced by the effective periodic potential . in the context of both the fiber gratings fbg1,fbg2,gapmodel and matter waves ( bec )",
    "@xcite , gap solitons were predicted theoretically , including 2d gap solitons in bec salerno , bec-2d , and 2d solitons with embedded vorticity @xcite .",

    "<S> we introduce a model which integrates the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation in two dimensions ( 2d ) with the linear - cubic - quintic combination of loss and gain terms , self - defocusing nonlinearity , and a periodic potential . in this system , </S>",
    "<S> stable 2d _ dissipative gap solitons _ ( dgss ) are constructed , both fundamental and vortical ones . </S>",
    "<S> the soliton families belong to the first finite bandgap of the system s linear spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are obtained in a numerical form and also by means of an analytical approximation , which combines the variational description of the shape of the fundamental and vortical solitons and the balance equation for their total power . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results agree with numerical findings . </S>",
    "<S> the model may be implemented as a laser medium in a bulk self - defocusing optical waveguide equipped with a transverse 2d grating , the predicted dgss representing spatial solitons in this setting . </S>"
