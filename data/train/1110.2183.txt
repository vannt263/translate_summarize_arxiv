    "recently , impressive experimental attempts have been made to explore the properties of bose gases near feshbach resonance   @xcite . in these experiments , it has been suggested that when approaching resonance from the side of small positive scattering lengths in the upper branch , bose atoms appear to be thermalized within a reasonably short time , well before the recombination processes set in , and so form a quasistatic condensate .",
    "furthermore , the life time due to the recombination processes is much longer than the many - body time scale set by the degeneracy temperature .",
    "this property of bose gases near resonance and the recent measurement of the chemical potentials for a long - lived condensate by navon _",
    "et al_.  @xcite motivate us to make further theoretical investigations on the fundamental properties of bose gases at large scattering lengths .",
    "the theory of dilute bose gases has a long history , starting with the bogoliubov theory of weakly interacting bose gases  @xcite . a properly regularized theory of dilute gases of bosons with contact interactions",
    "was first put forward by lee , huang , and yang  @xcite and later by beliaev  @xcite , who developed a field - theoretical approach .",
    "higher - order corrections were further examined in later years  @xcite .",
    "since these results were obtained by applying an expansion in terms of the small parameter @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 is the density and @xmath2 is the scattering length ) , it is not surprising that , formally speaking , each of the terms appearing in the dilute - gas theory diverges when the scattering lengths are extrapolated to infinity . as far as we know ,",
    "resummation of these contributions , even in an approximate way , has been lacking  @xcite .",
    "this aspect , to a large extent , is the main reason why a qualitative understanding of bose gases near resonance has been missing for so long .",
    "there have been a few theoretical efforts to understand the bose gases at large positive scattering lengths .",
    "the numerical efforts have been focused on the energy minimum in truncated hilbert spaces , which have been argued to be relevant to bose gases studied in experiments  @xcite .",
    "these efforts are consistent in pointing out that the bose gases are nearly fermionized near resonance . however , there are two important unanswered questions in the previous studies .",
    "one is whether the energy minimum found in a restricted subspace is indeed metastable in the whole hilbert space .",
    "the other equally important issue is what the role of three - body efimov physics in the bose gases near resonance is .",
    "below we outline a nonperturbative approach to the long - lived condensates near resonance .",
    "we have applied this approach to explore the nature of bose gases near resonance and to address the above issues .",
    "one concept emerging from this study is that a quantum gas ( either fermionic or bosonic ) at a positive scattering length does not always appear to be equivalent to a gas of effectively repulsive atoms ; this idea , which we believe has been overlooked in many recent studies , plays a critical role in our analysis of bose gases near resonance .",
    "our main conclusions are fourfold :  ( a ) energetically , the bose gases close to unitarity are nearly _ fermionized _ , i.e. , the chemical potentials of the bose gases approach that of the fermi energy of a fermi gas with equal mass and density ;  ( b ) an onset instability sets in at a positive critical scattering length , beyond which the bose gases appear to lose the metastability as a consequence of the sign change of effective interactions at large scattering lengths ;  ( c ) because of a strong coupling with molecules near resonance , the chemical potential reaches a maximum in the vicinity of the instability point ;  ( d ) at the point of instability , we estimate , via summation of loop diagrams , the effect of three - body forces to be around a few percent .    feature ( a )",
    "is consistent with previous numerical calculations  @xcite ; both ( b ) and ( c ) are surprising features , not anticipated in the previous numerical calculations or in the standard dilute - gas theory  @xcite . our attempt here is mainly intended to reach an in - depth understanding of the energetics , metastability of bose gases beyond the usual dilute limit as well as the contributions of three - body effects .",
    "the approach also reproduces quantitative features of the dilute - gas theory . in sec .",
    "ii and appendixes a - c , we outline our main calculations and arguments . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the conclusion of our studies .",

    "@xmath8 is the number density of the condensed atoms and @xmath9 is the chemical potential , both of which are functions of @xmath2 and are to be determined self - consistently .",

    "the one - loop contributions to @xmath17 for @xmath18 in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) all scale like @xmath19 , and their sum yields the well - known lee - huang - yang ( lhy ) correction to the energy density  @xcite .",

    "for the normal self - energy ( @xmath26 ) and the anomalous counterpart ( @xmath27 ) introduced by beliaev , by classifying the diagrams hugenholtz and pines had shown that , in general , the following identity holds  @xcite in the limit of zero energy and momentum : @xmath28 . following a very similar calculation",

    "note that hydrodynamic considerations had also been employed previously by haldane to construct the luttinger - liquid formulation for one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose fluids  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath34 is small , eq .  ( [ se ] ) leads to the well - known result , @xmath35 .",
    "the self - consistent approach outlined below is mainly suggested by an observation that a subclass of one - loop diagrams [ shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) ] yields almost all contributions in the lhy correction ( see below and appendixes a and b ) .",
    "resummation of these and their @xmath36-loop counterparts can be conveniently carried out by introducing the _ renormalized _ or effective potentials @xmath37 as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , where all internal lines represent , instead of the noninteracting green s function @xmath38 , the interacting hartree - fock green s function , @xmath39 .",
    "this approximation captures the main contributions to the chemical potential in the dilute limit because the renormalization of two - body interactions is mainly due to virtual states with energies higher than @xmath9 where the hartree - fock treatment turns out to be a good approximation .",

    "we find @xmath60 , and the number equation yields an estimate @xmath61 .",
    "the second terms in the parentheses are of the same nature as the lhy correction . comparing to beliaev s perturbative result for chemical potential , @xmath62  @xcite , and for the condensation fraction @xmath63",

    "technically , one can further examine @xmath45 by expanding it in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath26 and then compare with the usual diagrams in the dilute gas theory  @xcite .",
    "one indeed finds that @xmath45 in eq .",

    "@xmath71 included below , on the other hand , includes ( @xmath70)-loop contributions with @xmath72 interaction vertices that only involve three virtual atoms ; two adjacent loops share one internal line instead of a single vertex [ see fig .",

( [ mu ] ) . the processes involving four or more excited atoms only appear in @xmath73 and are not included here ; at the one - loop level following the above calculations , the corresponding contributions from the processes involving multiple pairs of virtual atoms are indeed negligible .",
    "a solution to eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "2 . an interesting feature of eq .  ( [ sc ] )",
    "is that it no longer has a real solution once @xmath51 exceeds the critical value of @xmath52 , implying an onset instability ; this is not anticipated in the dilute - gas theory  @xcite .",
    "this can also be illustrated by considering the two - body effective coupling constant @xmath74 as a function of @xmath75  @xcite , a characteristic momentum that defines a low - energy subspace , @xmath76 for bose gases , it is appropriate to identify the relevant @xmath75 as @xmath77 . for positive scattering lengths , @xmath2 not only defines the strength of interaction in the small @xmath78 or dilute limit but also sets a scale for @xmath78 , above which the effective interaction becomes negative , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath79 if @xmath80 .",
    "so as @xmath2 approaches infinity , condensed atoms with a chemical potential @xmath9 typically see each other as attractive rather than repulsive , resulting in molecules  @xcite .",
    "thus , beyond the critical point the upper branch atomic gases become strongly coupled to the molecules with a strength proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , we anticipate that @xmath9 decreases quickly beyond the critical scattering length due to the formation of molecules , leading to a maximum in @xmath9 in the vicinity of the critical point  @xcite .",
    "a renormalization group approach based on atom - molecule fields was also applied in a previous study to understand bose gases near resonance  @xcite .",
    "our results differ from theirs in two aspects .",
    "first , in our approach , an onset instability sets in near resonance even when the scattering length is positive , a key feature that is absent in that previous study .",
    "second , when extrapolated to the limit of small @xmath34 , the results in ref .",
    "@xcite imply a correction of the order of @xmath0 to the usual hartree - fock chemical potential but with a negative sign , opposite to the sign of lhy corrections . in a recent study  @xcite ,",
    "a self - consistent mean - field equation was employed , leading to a similar conclusion as the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the approach does not yield the correct sign of the lhy corrections .",
    "and so the onset instability pointed out in this paper , which is surprising from the point of view of dilute - gas theory , is also absent there .",
    "the chemical potential near the critical point can be estimated using eq .",
    "( [ sc ] ) and is close to @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the fermi energy defined for a gas of density @xmath1 .",
