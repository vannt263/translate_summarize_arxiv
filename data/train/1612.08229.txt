    "fredholm matrices appear naturally in graph theory .",
    "they arise most prominently in the * chebotarev - shamis forest theorem * @xcite which tells that @xmath26 is the number of rooted forests in a graph @xmath0 , if @xmath27 is the kirchhoff laplacian of @xmath0 .",
    "this forest theorem follows readily from the * generalized cauchy - binet formula * @xcite @xmath28 which holds for any pair @xmath29 of @xmath30 matrices and were the right hand side is a dot product of the minor vector giving all possible minors of the matrix , defined by the index set @xmath31 which can be empty in which case @xmath32 .",
    "the forest theorem uses this with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are poincar s incidence matrices .",
    "the fredholm determinant @xmath26 is then @xmath36 , which directly counts rooted forests .",
    "+ similarly , any fredholm determinant @xmath37 of a matrix @xmath1 can be written as @xmath38 which implies the well known formula @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath41th exterior power of @xmath1 . that expansion is at the heart of extending determinants to fredholm determinants in infinite dimensions , in particular if @xmath1 is trace class @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we look at the adjacency matrix @xmath1 , which unlike the laplacian @xmath27 of a graph is not positive semi - definite so that one can not write @xmath42 for some other matrix . indeed , the determinant of an adjacency matrix @xmath43 of a graph @xmath0 appears rather arbitrary in the strong sense that experiments show that a limiting distribution emerges when looking at the random variables @xmath44 on probability spaces of graphs .",
    "see figure  ( [ distribution ] ) .",
    "+ given a finite simple graph @xmath0 with adjacency matrix @xmath1 , we call @xmath45 the * fredholm adjacency matrix * and @xmath46 the * fredholm determinant * of @xmath0",
    ". the fredholm determinant of a graph can be pretty arbitrary as the following examples show : for complete graphs @xmath47 , where the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix are @xmath48 with multiplicity @xmath49 and @xmath49 with multiplicity @xmath50 and the fredholm determinant is @xmath21 for @xmath51 . for cyclic graphs",
    "@xmath52 , the fredholm determinant is @xmath53-periodic in @xmath49 , zero for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for @xmath56 not divisible by @xmath55 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 not divisible by @xmath53 . for wheel graphs",
    "@xmath59 with @xmath60 vertices , it is @xmath61 if @xmath49 is not divisible by @xmath55 and @xmath21 else .",
    "measuring the statistical distribution of fredholm determinant on classes of random graphs suggests that the normalized distribution of the adjacency or fredholm determinants produces an absolutely continuous limit with singularity .",
    "also this appears not yet explored theoretically but it illustrates that the fredholm determinant of a general graph can be pretty arbitrary .",
    "+ we can think of @xmath62 as a partition function or a  path integral `` , in which the underlying paths are fixed - point - free permutations of the vertices of the graph .",
    "the determinant generates therefore * derangements * and @xmath63 defines the oriented paths . on the other hand ,",
    "the fredholm determinant @xmath46 is a partition function for all oriented paths in the graph as @xmath64 can now also have pairs @xmath65 as transpositions and vertices @xmath66 as fixed points .",
    "one can see the effect of changing from determinants to fredholm determinants well when replacing the determinants with the * permanent * , the bosonic analogue of the determinant : @xmath67 is the number * derangements * of the vertex set of the graph while @xmath68 is the number of all * permutations * of the vertex set honoring the connections . for the complete graphs @xmath69 in particular , @xmath70 generates the * permutation sequence * @xmath71 while the permanent of the adjacency matrix @xmath72 generates the * derangement sequence * @xmath73 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that fredholm determinants are natural .",
    "+ the distribution of fredholm determinants changes drastically if we evaluate them on the set of * connection graphs * , graphs which have the set of simplices of a graph @xmath0 as subgraphs and where two simplices are connected if they intersect .",
    "connection graphs are also defined for abstract finite simplicial complexes or even finite cw complexes .",
    "if we talk about a graph @xmath0 , we usually understand it equipped with the whitney complex , the set of complete subgraphs of @xmath0 .",
    "but any simplicial complex structure or cw complex structure on the graph works . it does not even have to come from simplices .",
    "the * graphic matroid * of a graph is an example where the connection graph has forests in @xmath0 as vertices and has two forests connected if some trees in it share a common branch .",
    "+ for the smaller * barycentric refinement * @xmath74 of @xmath0 , two simplices are connected only if and only if one is contained in the other .",
    "the graph @xmath74 has the same vertices than @xmath75 but is a subgraph of @xmath75 .",
    "connection graphs are in general much higher dimensional than the graph @xmath0 or even the barycentric refinement @xmath74 : for a triangle @xmath76 already , @xmath75 a graph which contains the complete graph @xmath77 .",
    "small spheres like the octahedron are examples where @xmath0 and @xmath75 are not homotopic because @xmath75 has euler characteristic @xmath21 while the octahedron , as a 2-sphere has euler characteristic @xmath22 .",
    "however this only is the case because the sphere is too small . for the icosahedron @xmath0 already , the connection graph @xmath75 a two sphere again .",
    "in general , the barycentric refinement @xmath74 of a graph @xmath0 has a connection graph @xmath78 which is homotopic to @xmath74 and so to @xmath0 .",
    "this implies then that all cohomology groups of @xmath0 and @xmath78 agree .",
    "while @xmath0 and @xmath74 are not homeomorphic as already their dimension is different in general , they can be useful in geometry , like barycentric refinements .",
    "they can be used for example to * regularize singularities * as they ' ' homotopically fatten \" the  discrete manifolds \" or simplicial complexes and still have the same homotopy type after applying one barycentric refinement . + we got interested in connection graphs in the context of  connection calculus `` , a calculus where differential forms are not functions on simplices but on pairs or @xmath41-tuples of connecting simplices in the simplicial complex .",
    "the corresponding cohomology is compatible with calculus in the sense that common theorems like gauss - bonnet @xcite , poincar - hopf @xcite , euler - poincar or kuenneth @xcite or brouwer - lefschetz fixed point theorem @xcite generalize when euler characteristic is replaced by * wu characteristic * but for which the cohomology is finer .",
    "the cohomology already allows to distinguish spaces which classical simplicial cohomology can not , like the mbius strip and the cylinder @xcite .",
    "+ the bowen - lanford * zeta function * @xcite of a graph @xmath0 with adjacency matrix @xmath1 is defined as the complex function @xmath79 , from @xmath80 to @xmath80 , where @xmath1 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath81 is the spectral radius of @xmath1 , the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath1 , then the function @xmath82 is analytic in @xmath83 .",
    "the fredholm determinant of @xmath1 is then @xmath84 , which if @xmath48 is an eigenvalue of @xmath1 is defined as @xmath21 .",
    "zeta functions are of interest as they relate with topology .",
    "we have a taylor expansion @xmath85 for small @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the number of rooted closed paths of length @xmath41 in the graph .",
    "the zeta function is therefore a generating function for a dynamical property of the graph , the dynamical system being the markov chain defined by the graph .",
    "it is in particular an * artin - mazur zeta function * and a special case of the * ruelle zeta function * @xcite .",
    "since @xmath88 is a rational function , the sum can be understood for general @xmath89 only by analytic continuation . while for general graphs",

    "its whitney complex is large as there are already 24 triangles present . but",
    "adding 6 cells with @xmath148 boundaries , we get the familiar picture of a cube with f=6 two dimensional faces , e=12 one dimensional edges and v=8 vertices .",
