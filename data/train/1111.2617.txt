    "the quasiparticles of the read rezayi state are related to fibonacci anyons@xcite , which have a more intricate structure that in principle allows universal quantum computation@xcite .",
    "there is currently great interest in realizing quantum hall physics in materials without an external magnetic field or landau levels .",
    "this possibility was inspired by haldane s realization@xcite that a zero field integer quantum hall effect can occur in graphene , provided time reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "though such an anomalous quantum hall effect has not yet been observed , related physics occurs in topological insulators@xcite , which have been predicted and observed in both two and three dimensional systems .",
    "recently , there have been suggestions for generalizations of this idea to zero field fractional quantum hall states@xcite , as well as fractional topological insulators@xcite .",
    "the question naturally arises whether it is possible to engineer zero field non - abelian quantum hall states@xcite , which exhibit the full ising , or even fibonacci anyons .    a difficulty with answering this question is a lack of methods for dealing with strongly interacting systems .",
    "moore and read , and later read and rezayi , built on laughlin s idea@xcite and constructed trial many body wave functions as correlators of non trivial conformal field theories@xcite .",
    "this allowed most properties of the quasiparticles and edge states to be deduced , and it had the virtue of allowing the construction of interacting electron hamiltonians with the desired ground state .",
    "however , since this approach relied on the structure of the lowest landau level , it is not clear how it can be applied to a lattice system .",
    "effective topological quantum field theories@xcite and parton constructions @xcite provide an elegant framework for classifying quantum hall states and provide a description of their low energy properties .",
    "however , since the original electronic degrees of freedom are replaced by more abstract variables , these theories provide little guidance for what kind of electronic hamiltonian can lead to a given state .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new method for describing non abelian quantum hall states by considering an anisotropic system consisting of an array of coupled one dimensional wires .",
    "study of the anisotropic limit of quantum hall states dates back to thouless et al.@xcite , who used this limit to evaluate the chern invariant in the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "the chalker coddington model@xcite for the integer quantum hall effect also has a simple anisotropic limit , which is closely related to the coupled wire model .",
    "a coupled wire construction for abelian fractional quantum hall states was introduced in ref . .",
    "here we build on that work and show how the coupled wire construction can be adapted to describe the moore read pfaffian state , as well as the more general read rezayi sequence of quantum hall states .    the coupled wire construction has a number of desirable features .",
    "first , it allows for the definition of a simple hamiltonian , expressed in terms of electronic degrees of freedom , that can be transformed , via abelian bosonization , into a form that for certain special parameters can be solved essentially exactly .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum , as well as the edge state structure follow in a straightforward manner .",
    "the coupled wire construction thus provides a direct link between a microscopic electron hamiltonian and the low energy conformal field theory description of the edge states . as such",
    ", it provides an intermediate between the wave function approach to quantum hall states and the effective field theory approach .",
    "the coupled wire construction also provides a simple picture for the quantum entanglement present in quantum hall states@xcite .",
    "when the electron hamiltonian is transformed via abelian bosonization , it becomes identical to a theory of strips of quantum hall fluid coupled via electron tunneling between their edge states .",
    "it thus provides a concrete setting for the more abstract coupled edge state models considered by gils , et al.@xcite .",
    "the coupled wire model is also similar in spirit to the aklt model of quantum spin chains@xcite , which provides a similarly intuitive and solvable model for understanding fractionalization in one dimension . for the non abelian quantum hall states ,",
    "the coupled wire construction provides a concrete interpretation for the coset construction , which is a powerful ( albeit abstract ) mathematical tool for describing non abelian quantum hall states@xcite .",
    "a final virtue of the coupled wire construction is that it can be applied to zero field anisotropic lattice models .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field in the coupled wire model is to modify the momentum conservation relations when electrons tunnel between wires .",
    "a similar effect could arise due to scattering from a periodic potential .",
    "the coupled wire construction may thus provide some guidance for the construction of lattice models for the fractional and non abelian quantum hall states . note that our construction is somewhat different from the proposals for chern insulators refs . because we do not require nearly flat bands with an non zero chern number .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we will begin in section ii with an extended introduction to the coupled wire construction for abelian quantum hall states .",
    "much of this material was contained either explicitly or implicitly in ref . . here",
    ", since we are free from the constraints of a short paper , we will fill in some details that were absent in ref . .",
    "in particular , we will explain the generalization of the coupled wire construction to describe systems of bosons , we will demonstrate the abelian fractional statistics of quasiparticles described in our approach , and we will explicitly construct second level hierarchical fractional quantum hall states .",
    "section iii is devoted to the moore read state .",
    "we will begin with a construction of this state for bosons at filling @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to a bosonized model that can be solved using via fermionization .",
    "we will then show that for a special set of parameters the model has a particularly simple form , which can be interpreted in the framework of the coset construction of conformal field theory .",
    "we will conclude section iii by showing how to construct the more general moore read state at filling @xmath4 for @xmath5 even ( odd ) for bosons ( fermions ) .    in section iv we will generalize our construction to describe the read rezayi sequence at level @xmath6 .",
    "again , the formulation is simplest for bosons at filling @xmath7 , where the coupled wire model is closely related to the coset construction of these state .",
    "we show that the coupled wire model leads maps to a bosonized representation of the critical point of a @xmath8 statistical mechanics model , which for @xmath9 reduces to the 3 state potts model .",
    "this bosonized representation allows us to identify the @xmath8 parafermion primary fields and fully characterize the edge states of the read rezayi states . finally , as in section ii",
