    "spin properties attract the great attention in recent years due to attempts to realize an electronic device based on the spin of carriers .",
    "conduction electrons are obvious candidates for such devices , particularly in nanostructures where electron energy spectrum and shape of the envelope functions can be effectively engineered by the growth design , application of electric or magnetic fields as well as by illumination with light .",
    "various semiconductor materials are being involved in the spintronics activities .",
    "sige quantum well structures are among them .",
    "although bulk si and ge have a center of symmetry , quantum - well structures grown from these materials can lack such a center and allow the spin splitting of the electronic subbands .",
    "the quantum engineering of spintronics devices is usually focused on the rashba spin - dependent contribution to the electron effective hamiltonian in heterostructures .",
    "this contribution appears due asymmetry of the heterostructure ( the so - called structure inversion asymmetry , or sia ) and has no relation to the properties of a bulk semiconductor .",
    "it is commonly believed that the dresselhaus contribution caused by bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) is absent in structures grown from centrosymmetric materials . in the present work",
    "we show for the first time that the dresselhaus - like spin splitting is possible in heterostructures made of si and ge , as an alternative to the rashba effect , and it occurs due to the anisotropy of chemical bonds at interfaces .",
    "we consider quantum well ( qw ) structures grown along the axis @xmath1 $ ] , and introduce two orthogonal directions in the interface plane , @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] . depending on the properties of an interface between si@xmath4ge@xmath5 and si , its symmetry on average can be c@xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite the former point group describes the symmetry of an ideal heterointerface with the interfacial chemical bonds lying in the same plane .",
    "a nonideal interface containing monoatomic fluctuations has two kinds of flat areas with interfacial planes shifted with respect to each other by a quarter of the lattice constant .",
    "the local symmetry of each area is c@xmath8 as well .",
    "however if the both kinds are equally distributed , the interface overall symmetry increases up to @xmath7 .",
    "it follows then that the symmetry of a si@xmath4ge@xmath5/si quantum well structure containing two interfaces is described by one of five point groups : @xmath9 or @xmath10 in case of two ideal interfaces with odd or even number of monolayers between them ; @xmath11 for a pair of ideal and rough interfaces ; @xmath7 or @xmath12 for two non - ideal interfaces of the overall symmetry @xmath7",
    "each | see fig .  1 .    = = 0.3    the lowest conduction band in ( 001)-sige / si qws is located near the @xmath13 point of the brillouin zone . at this point ,",
    "the bulk electron states form projective representations of the point group @xmath12 .",
    "all five above - mentioned groups are subgroups of @xmath12 .",
    "two of them , @xmath12 and @xmath10 , contains the space inversion operation and forbid the spin splitting of electronic states .",
    "three remaining groups allow the spin - dependent linear - in-@xmath0 term @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 are the pauli matrices and @xmath16 is the in - plane electron wave vector . note that in the following we consider the electronic states attached to the @xmath17 valley which lies lower than @xmath18 and @xmath19 valleys .",
    "@xcite    in the group @xmath9 , the dresselhaus - like term @xmath20 is an only invariant which can be constructed from the products @xmath21 . in particular ,",
    "the rashba term @xmath22 is forbidden . on the contrary , in the group @xmath7",
    ", the only invariant combination is @xmath22 .",
    "the analysis shows that both combinations @xmath23 and @xmath24 are invariants of the group @xmath11 .",
    "hence the latter allows both dresselhaus- and rashba - like spin - dependent terms .",
    "microscopically , a linear - in-@xmath25 correction to the conduction - band effective hamiltonian is given by the second order of the perturbation theory @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath29 and spin - orbit interaction hamiltonians , respectively .",
    "we take into consideration only the coupling of the conduction states @xmath30 with the valence states @xmath31 , where the indices @xmath32 enumerate the degenerate states .",
    "the symmetry properties of the bloch functions at the @xmath13 point of a diamond - lattice semiconductor crystal coincide with those of the following functions  @xcite @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lattice constant . for the bulk states @xmath36 in the bases  ( [ x1 ] ) ,  ( [ x4 ] ) ,",
    "the interband matrix elements can be presented as @xmath37 here @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the momentum operator , and @xmath41 is the @xmath42-component of the pseudovector @xmath43 which enters into the spin - orbit hamiltonian @xmath44 .",
    "the substitution of ( [ kpso ] ) into ( [ second_order ] ) gives a spin - dependent matrix @xmath45 proportional to @xmath46 which however _ does not _ lead to removal of the degeneracy of the @xmath47-states in the bulk centrosymmetric material as expected .",
    "the splitting can be achieved if one takes into account the anisotropy of chemical bonds at the interfaces which results in @xmath48-functional contributions to @xmath27 and @xmath49 of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the interface coordinate , and the matrices @xmath52 have few linearly independent components . in the case of the lowest symmetry under study , @xmath11 , each matrix",
    "is determined by four linearly - independent parameters @xmath53 in the bases  ( [ x1 ] ) ,  ( [ x4 ] ) , the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath56 are purely imaginary .    according to eq .",
    "( [ second_order ] ) , the linear in @xmath57 correction to the conduction - band hamiltonian for a single interface of the @xmath11-symmetry , is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a linear combination of the pauli matrices .",
    "treating the perturbation ( [ deltakpso ] ) in the first - order approximation , one can obtain @xmath60   \\nonumber\\\\ & - & { { \\cal u } \\over e_0 } \\biggl [ ( \\sigma_x k_x - \\sigma_y k_y ) ( p_1 + p_3 ) + ( \\sigma_x k_y - \\sigma_y k_x ) ( p_2 + p_4 ) \\biggr ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the energy separation between @xmath47 and @xmath62 states .",
    "the electron effective hamiltonian in an ideal qw contains a sum of two contributions ( [ c2vif ] ) related to the left- and right - hand - side interfaces .",
    "the corresponding parameters @xmath63 or @xmath64 are interconnected by @xmath65_r = [ u_3 , u_4 , u_1 , u_2]_l,\\ ] ] @xmath66_r = [ - p_3 , - p_4 , - p_1 , -p_2]_l,\\ ] ] if the qw contains an even number of monoatomic layers ( @xmath67 symmetry ) , and @xmath68_r = [ u_1 , - u_2 , u_3 , - u_4]_l,\\ ] ] @xmath66_r = [ p_1 , -p_2 , p_3 , -p_4]_l,\\ ] ] if the qw contains an odd number of monoatomic layers ( @xmath69 symmetry ) .",
    "it readily follows from here that , in the former case , the electronic states in si / ge qws are spin - degenerate ( @xmath70 ) and , in the latter , the spin degeneracy is removed by a dresselhaus - like linear - in-@xmath0 terms .",
    "the similar analysis can be carried out for non - ideal si / ge qw structures of the @xmath11 and @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "in this work , we have analyzed spin splitting of electron states in si / ge heterostructures of all possible symmetries .",
    "this opens a possibility to discuss the recent spin relaxation times measurements in these heterostructures .",
