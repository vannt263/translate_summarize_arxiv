    "this drastic difference constitutes the main physical insight of this paper .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that the fundamental tradeoff between energy and precision depends on the random variable we select .",
    "this fundamental difference comes from the different scaling of the dispersion @xmath150 and @xmath27 in the limit @xmath146 .",

    "this relation is easy to understand .",
    "the dispersion associated with @xmath18 , for @xmath153 , is proportional to the fast time - scale @xmath154 , since the escape rates of all states are of order @xmath138 . since the constants in eq .",

    "an essential difference between @xmath24 and @xmath109 is the following .",
    "kirchhof s law is valid for @xmath109 even at the level of stochastic trajectories @xcite .",
    "hence , not only the average current is the same for the three links in the model but the dispersion is also independent of the link we choose to count the transitions .",
    "both @xmath130 and @xmath150 are proportional to @xmath137 . for the random variable @xmath24 , the average velocity does not depend on the link , i.e. , if we take @xmath156 , its average is the same as the average of @xmath24 in eq .",
    "however , the dispersion related to @xmath24 is generally different from the dispersion related to @xmath157 .    even though our result was obtained with a simple three state model , it constitutes a general principle valid for any markov process : there is no minimal amount of energy that must be consumed in order to achieve a certain precision quantified by a random variable of the form given in eq . .",
    "we can simply follow the same strategy for arbitrary @xmath0 in a unicyclic network . setting the rates",
    "associated with the link related to @xmath24 much slower than the other transition rates leads to a vanishing product @xmath158 .",
    "since a multicyclic network can always have rates in such a way that it behaves effectively like a unicyclic network @xcite , this result also extends to arbitrary networks .",
    "the fact that the time random variable can lead to a limit of dissipation - less precision should not be confused with the results from @xcite . in this reference , a dissipation - less clock , with its precision characterized by the current random variable , can be obtained for systems that are driven out of equilibrium by an external periodic protocol , which are different from systems driven by a fixed thermodynamic force like the one considered here .",
    "we have obtained an expression in terms of the transition rates for the dispersion of the time a stochastic trajectory spends in a cluster of states of a unicyclic network .",
    "the unicyiclic network can have an arbitrary number of states with inhomogeneous transition rates .",
    "our expression should be an important tool for applications in which this random variable is an observable of interest , like for a cell that estimates the concentration of an external ligand .    with the help of this expression we have analyzed the tradeoff between precision and dissipation in a simple three state model .",
    "we have shown that if the precision of a brownian clock is characterized by the time random variable from eq . , we can have a precise clock that dissipates an arbitrarily small amount of energy .",
    "this result is in contrast to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation for the current , showing that the trade - off between precision and dissipation is fundamentally different for these two random variables .",
    "while the current random variable seems like a more natural choice to quantify the precision of a brownian clock , with a simple physical interpretation like the number of products generated in a chemical reaction , the time random variable proposed here is , in principle , also a valid choice to quantify the precision .",
    "it would be interesting to build models that also include the thermodynamic cost of an internal observer that can keep track of these random variables .",
    "intuitively , one expects that the energetic cost of the observer that monitors the time random variable should be higher , as keeping track of @xmath24 seems to require a more sophisticated observer .",
    "investigating the relation between precision and dissipation in more elaborate models from biophysics constitutes a promising direction for future research @xcite .",
