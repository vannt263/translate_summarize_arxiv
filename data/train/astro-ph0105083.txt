    "the center of ngc  3226 hosts a low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) of optical spectroscopic type 1.9 ( ho , fillipenko & sargent , 1997a ) , along with large quantities of dust in filamentary structures ( e.g. rest et al .",
    "a compact , flat - spectrum radio source has recently been detected ( nagar et al . 2000 ; falcke et al . 2000 ) at a location consistent with the optical nucleus .",
    "this , along with the claim of a broad component to the h@xmath11 emission line ( fwhm @xmath12 ; ho et al .",
    "1997b ) , suggests the galaxy hosts an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) rather than a region of aging starburst activity .",
    "the luminosity of the broad h@xmath11 line in ngc  3226 ( @xmath13(h@xmath11 ) @xmath14 ) is an order of magnitude below the dividing line between so - called low - luminosity agn ( llagn , or `` dwarf '' seyfert galaxies ) and the more powerful ( `` normal '' ) seyfert 1 and giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "x - ray emission from the nuclear regions of ngc  3226 has been detected using both the _ rosat _  pspc ( komossa & fink 1997 ; sansom , hibbard & schweizer 2000 ) and hri ( roberts & warwick 2000 ) with an implied luminosity @xmath13(0.12  kev ) @xmath15 .",
    "however these data sets had relatively poor spatial resolution , and were unable to distinguish either spatially or spectroscopically between an ( agn - like ) power law x - ray spectrum and a collisionally ionized plasma due to hot gas ( e.g. from a starburst region ) .    in this _",
    "we present results for ngc  3226 obtained using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( _ cxo _ : e.g. weisskopf , odell , van speybroeck 1996 ) . following a brief description of the observation (  [ sec : obs ] ) , in ",
    "[ sec : spatial ] we report the detection of three x - ray sources within the inner @xmath16  kpc of the nucleus , with brightest source identified as the nucleus of ngc  3226 . in  [ sec:3226 ]",
    "we report the temporal and spectral characteristics of the nucleus , and discuss the evidence that ngc  3226 harbors a llagn",
    ". the limited constraints that can be obtained from the two off - nuclear sources are discussed in  [ sec : spec - others ] .",
    "we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the data from ngc  3226 reported here were obtained during an observation using the _ cxo _ in 1999 dec . the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs : e.g. markert et al .",
    "1994 ) was employed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis : e.g. nousek et al 1998 ) in the focal plane ( with a temperature of @xmath17  c ) .",
    "the hetgs consists of two sets of gratings ( hereafter the medium- and high - energy grating \\{meg & heg } `` arms '' ) , each with a different period and intercepting x - rays from ( two of the four ) different shells of the x - ray telescope .",
    "the rulings of the meg and heg differ by @xmath010  degrees preventing any spatial overlap in the dispersed spectra of an on - axis , point source .",
    "the acis - s array was placed at the optical axis , consisting of 6 ccd chips orientated to record the undispersed ( @xmath18-order ) photons from the target and nearby sources ( on the acis - s3 ccd ) , along with both the positive and negative orders of the spectrum dispersed by both grating arms of the hetgs .",
    "the observation was continuous , with a total duration of 49.9  ks . following screening and removing the `` streaks '' from the s4 chip using destreak ( v  1.3 ; houck 2000 ) , the resultant exposure time was 46.3  ks .",
    "all the data analysis presented here was performed using the _ chandra _ caldb ( v2.0 ) , and the ciao ( v2.0.2 ) and heasoft ( v5.0.2 ) software packages .",
    "further details on the instrumental parameters and the data reduction can be found in george et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , along with the scientific results for ngc  3227 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : spatial ] we show an image of ngc  3226 in the 0.6 - 8  kev band . for simplicity ,",
    "here we ignore any peculiar motion associated with the ngc  3226/3227 system or other members of its local group , and simply use the heliocentric velocity of ngc  3226 to derive a distance to @xmath19  mpc ( where @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus 1  arcsec @xmath21  pc .",
    "three x - ray sources are evident .",
    "we find the centroid of the brightest source to be at ra=10h  23 m  27.00s , dec=+19d  53 m  54.7s ( j2000 ) .",
    "this is consistent the position of the optical nucleus of ngc  3226 ( ra=10h  23 m  27.08s , dec=+19d  53 m  54.5s ; cotton , condon & arbizzani 1999 ) within the current uncertainties in the aspect reconstruction of _ cxo _ data ( @xmath221  arcsec ; aldcroft , p.comm ) , and in excellent agreement with the compact , flat - spectrum radio source ( ra=10h  23 m  27.01s , dec=+19d  53 m  54.5s ; falcke et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus we identify this x - ray emission as the hetgs @xmath18-order image of the inner @xmath23  pc of ngc  3226 . from an analysis using a marr wavelet function provided by the wavdetect task in ciao we estimate a net source count rate of @xmath24 .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", nothing has been reported in the literature concerning the other two sources , cxo  j102334.1 + 195347 and cxo  j102326.7 + 195407 ( labelled x-2 & x-3 respectively in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] ) .",
    "both are much weaker than the nucleus ( with estimated source count rates of @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively ) .",
    "for the ( temporal and spectral analysis ) presented below we employed a circular extraction cell of radius @xmath27  arcsec centered on the nucleus .",
    "the background was obtained from a circular annulus with an outer radius @xmath28  arcsec centered on the nucleus , but also excluding circular regions of radius @xmath27  arcsec around x-2 and x-3 . the background was then rescaled to be appropriate for the source extraction cell .",
    "we find marginal evidence for variability from the nucleus of ngc  3226 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc1000]a we show the observed count rate in 0.86  kev band as a function of time using @xmath29  s bins .",
    "there are 21 such bins , each containing @xmath020 counts on average , thus @xmath30-statistics can be used ( but with some caution ) .",
    "the hypothesis of a constant count rate is rejected at @xmath31% confidence ( @xmath32 for 20 degrees of freedom , hereafter d.o.f . ) .",
    "using @xmath33  s bins , a constant count rate is rejected at @xmath34% confidence ( @xmath35 for 10 d.o.f . ) .    given the data from ngc  3226",
    "are in the `` grey - area '' where the appropriateness of using @xmath30-statistics is debatable ( i.e. @xmath36 bins , each with a relatively small number of counts ) we have also performed a temporal analysis assuming poissonian statistics .",
    "this analysis also indicates evidence for variability .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc1000]b we show the observed ( red ) number of bins ( each of @xmath37  s ) , containing 0 , 1 , 2 , .... counts compared to the predicted poisson distribution ( blue ) derived from the mean count rate of @xmath38 . for the example shown , we find 6 of the 42 bins outside the the 95% confidence limits ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc1000]b ) compared to the 2.1 predicted from a poisson distribution .",
    "we have repeated this analysis 20 times , on each occasion offsetting the start time of each @xmath37  s bin by 1/20 of a bin width .",
    "we find the observed number of bins exceeds the predicted number on 13 of the 20 occasions .",
    "similarly we have repeated the analysis using bins of different temporal sizes , and find cases where number of bins observed outside the 95% confidence limits exceeds that expected for bins in the @xmath0few@xmath39few@xmath40  s. nevertheless , given the current data are in the poissonian regime , again we consider the evidence only marginal .",
    "spectra were extracted from the ( @xmath18-order ) cell described above using the psextract script in ciao .",
    "the resultant pulse - invariant ( pi ) channels at energies @xmath41  kev were then grouped so as to contain a minimum of 20 counts per bin , and hence allowing a @xmath42 minimization technique to be employed .",
    "this resulted in 24 spectral bins which were analyzed within the xspec ( v 11.0.1 ) package .",
    "for the galactic absorption along the line - of - sight we assume an effective hydrogen column density of @xmath43 ( as measured towards ngc  3227 ; murphy et al 1996 ) .",
    "we find an absorbed power law provides an adequate fit to the data ( @xmath44 for 21 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the best - fitting parameters and 68% confidence ranges are a photon index @xmath45 , and intrinsic absorption ( in addition to @xmath46 ) of @xmath47 .",
    "the implied luminosity ( corrected for absorption ) in the 0.410  kev band is @xmath13(0.410  kev ) @xmath48 , and that in the 210  kev band @xmath13(210  kev ) @xmath49 .",
    "the data and this model are shown in fig.[fig : nuc_smth_spec]a . unfortunately any fe",
    "k@xmath11 emission can not be well constrained by the data ( equivalent widths @xmath50  kev and @xmath51  kev for narrow and broad lines at 6.4  kev respectively ) .",
    "an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung also provides an adequate fit to the data ( @xmath52 for 21 degrees of freedom ) , with @xmath53  kev , and with a luminosity and @xmath54 ( in addition to @xmath46 ) consistent with those found above .",
    "we shall discuss these two models further in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  3226 is sufficiently bright to also be detected in the dispersed spectrum .",
    "source and background spectra were extracted using the procedure described in george et al .",
    "the source exceeds the mean background level in the @xmath55-orders in the ranges @xmath56@xmath57  nm ( meg ) and @xmath58@xmath59  nm ( heg ) .",
    "the spectral resolution of the meg and heg can be well approximated by gaussians with ( `` @xmath60 '' ) widths @xmath61  pm and @xmath62  pm respectively ( @xmath63  pm @xmath64  m ; and also corresponds to @xmath01 acis pixel ) .",
    "both the meg and heg spectra have a very low signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively ) .",
    "we have constructed spectra using bins between 1 and 4 times the resolution of each grating arm .",
    "however we find no cases where the number of counts per bin exceeds 7 ( @xmath67% confidence limit for 1 count per bin ) , and hence no evidence that the spectrum contains any intense emission lines .",
    "using larger bin sizes , we find both the meg and heg spectra are in good agreement with that derived from the @xmath18-order ( e.g. fig.[fig : nuc_smth_spec]b ) .",
    "thus we find no requirement for additional spectral complexity from either the @xmath18-order or dispersed spectra .",
    "our spectral models predict _ rosat _ hri count rates ( @xmath68 ) consistent with those seen during an observation in 1995 aug ( roberts & warwick 2000 ) .",
    "however the predicted _ rosat _ pspc count rates ( @xmath69 ) are slightly lower than that reported during an observation in 1993 may ( @xmath70 from within a circular region of radius @xmath71  kpc is reported by sansom et al .",
    "this may be the result of variability on long timescales , and/or an additional soft x - ray component from the agn .",
    "however at least part of the higher count rate seen by the pspc may be due to other sources of ( perhaps time - variable ) x - ray emission associated with the galaxy .",
    "the improved spatial resolution of _ cxo _ has enabled us to show that the x - ray emission from ngc  3226 is dominated by a point - like ( tentatively variable ) source within @xmath72  kpc of the nucleus .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is measured up to @xmath010  kev and is consistent with a power law with a photon index @xmath1 , or thermal bremsstrahlung emission with @xmath2  kev .",
    "the ratio of observed flux at 2  kev ( @xmath73jy ) to that at 5  ghz from the flat - spectrum , compact radio source ( falcke et al . 2000 ) gives a radio - to - x - ray spectral index @xmath74 .",
    "such a value is consistent with that derived from several similar objects , including m  81 ( ngc  3031 ) and ngc  4579 ( both with @xmath75 ; e.g. ho 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "m  81 and ngc  4579 are of note since both are commonly believed to be accretion - powered objects .",
    "indeed fe k@xmath11 emission has been detected from both objects , which is broad in the case of m  81 ( ishisaki et al . 1996 ) and variable in the case of ngc  4579 ( terashima et al . 2000 ) , highly suggestive of an accretion disk .    in common with many other llagn , optical images",
    "reveal large quantities of dust in filamentary structures within the inner regions of ngc  3226 ( e.g. rest et al .",
    "the x - ray presented here also indicate intrinsic absorption . the equivalent hydrogen column density reported in  [ sec:3226-spec ] ( 3@xmath76 ) corresponds to @xmath77 assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio . using the spectral energy distributions of m  81 and ngc  4579 as templates ,",
    "both of which have an optical - to - x - ray spectral index @xmath78 ( after correcting for the better - known reddening in these galaxies ) , we predict the nucleus has @xmath79 .",
    "the nucleus is therefore predicted to be swamped by the stellar emission ( rest et al .",
    "find @xmath80 ) in the central regions , consistent with observations .",
    "these characteristics strongly suggest ngc  3226 hosts a central agn .",
    "such an hypothesis is also consistent with the broad component to the h@xmath11 emission line suggested by ho et al .",
    "( 1997b ) based on modeling of a fairly noisy spectrum of the h@xmath11 region ( where h@xmath11 is blended with ` [ ` n ii ` ] ` and ` [ ` s ii ` ] ` ; see their fig .",
    "terashima , ho & ptak ( 2000 ) have reported a strong correlation between @xmath13(210  kev ) and the luminosity of h@xmath11 for a number of galaxies containing type 1 liners .",
    "this correlation has recently been confirmed and extended by ho et al .",
    "this correlation supports the hypothesis that the dominant ionization source of the type 1 liners is the photon field of a central llagn .",
    "ngc  3226 is consistent with this correlation , adding further support to this hypothesis .",
    "the fact that the observed broad component of h@xmath11 constitutes a lower faction ( @xmath81% ) of the total ( broad plus narrow ) line emission compared to a more `` normal '' seyfert 1 galaxy ( eg . @xmath34% in ngc  3516 ) suggests differential ( probably patchy ) absorption towards the narrow- and broad - line regions .",
    "the optical luminosity of the entire galaxy ngc  3226 ( @xmath82 ; @xmath83 ) and a central , line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath84 ; simien & prugniel 1998 ) are consistent with the relation found for a variety of galaxies harboring black holes ( eg gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; and references therein ) .",
    "the implied central black hole mass is @xmath85 , and hence the implied accretion rate is _ m _ @xmath86 _ m_@xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the ratio of bolometric to 0.410  kev luminosity ( which is unlikely to much exceed 10 ) , and _ m_@xmath87 is the eddington accretion rate .",
    "some words of caution are necessary .",
    "first , we note that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion quoted above is derived from ground - based observations  as yet there have been no _ hst _",
    "observations capable of resolving the central kinematics of ngc  3226 .",
    "second , there have recently been a number of questions raised regarding the exact relation between the luminosity of the bulge and the mass of the black hole estimated by various means in different samples ( eg . see gebhardt et al . 2000b ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 , and references therein ) . nevertheless , if a black hole indeed exists at the center of ngc  3226 , the accretion rate is surely _ m_@xmath89_m_@xmath87 .    in systems with such low rates ,",
    "the mass infall is generally thought to occur via a `` standard '' ( geometrically - thin , viscosity - dominated ) accretion disk at large radii , but switch to a radiatively less - efficient advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) in the inner regions ( e.g. narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 , and references therein ) . the transition radius at which the flow becomes advection - dominated depends on a number of model parameters .",
    "estimates range from @xmath90@xmath91 schwarzschild radii for several llagn ( including m  81 and ngc  4579 ; e.g. see quataert et al .",
    "1999 ) to @xmath92 schwarzschild radii for giant elliptical galaxies within clusters ( di matteo et al .",
    "the x - ray emission from adafs is believed to be dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung ( with @xmath93few kev ) , and not expected to exhibit significantly variability on timescales shorter than the local dynamical time ( @xmath94  s at 10 schwarzschild radii from a @xmath95 black hole ",
    "see also ptak et al .",
    "1998 ) . in  [ sec:3226-spec ] we found a thermal bremsstrahlung model to be consistent with the observed spectrum of the nucleus . however ,",
    "if the variability on timescales @xmath22few@xmath40  s suggested in ",
    "[ sec:3226-temp ] is confirmed , time - dependent models will be required .",
    "there are too few counts from either cxo  j102334.1 + 195347 and cxo  j102326.7 + 195407 to enable detailed analysis .",
    "we find no evidence for statistically significant variability on any timescale .",
    "nevertheless some crude insight can be gained from consideration of counts detected in different energy bands . for cxo  j102334.1 + 195347 , the ratio of source counts ( 0.3 - 2  kev)/(210  kev ) @xmath96 . for a power law spectrum",
    ", such a ratio can be obtained with @xmath97 if absorption by only @xmath46 is assumed , or with @xmath98 and additional absorption of @xmath99@xmath100 . in the case of cxo  j102326.7 + 195407 , we find the ratio of counts ( 0.3 - 2  kev)/(210  kev ) @xmath101 , indicative of an even harder spectrum . assuming absorption by only @xmath46 , a power law with @xmath102 is required . assuming a power law with @xmath98 , additional absorption with @xmath103 is required .",
    "the proximity of both sources to the nucleus ( within a projected distance @xmath104  kpc ) strongly suggests both are x - ray sources within ngc  3226 .",
    "the observed flux from each source is @xmath0few@xmath105 in the 210  kev band .",
    "the density of background sources is @xmath106 in this band at this flux level ( e.g. mushotzky et al 2000 ; tozzi et al .",
    "2001 ; and references therein ) .",
    "thus the probability of a background source this bright within 15  arcsec of the nucleus of ngc  3226 is @xmath107 .    assuming both sources are indeed within ngc  3226 , the spectral forms described above imply absorption - corrected luminosities in the range @xmath0few@xmath6  few@xmath108 . assuming all emission from each source is indeed due to a single object , either or both cxo  j102334.1 + 195347 and cxo  j102326.7 + 195407 therefore have luminosities exceeding the eddington limit for neutron stars ( @xmath109 ) , and",

    "such superluminal sources are now being found regularly by _ cxo _",
    "griffiths et al . 2000 ; fabbiano , zezas & murray 2001 ) . variability and",
    "detailed x - ray spectroscopic studies are the most likely means the various source types can be distinguished .",
    "the results presented here illustrate the power of x - ray observations to detect and characterize the emission from llagn : a class of source which can usually only otherwise be studied at radio wavelengths and possibly with high signal - to - noise , high - resolution optical emission - line studies . indeed in many cases , as for ngc  3226 , the nucleus is expected to be invisible to _ hst _ in the optical band .",
    "we anticipate that many such objects will be detected serendipitously in the fields of future _ cxo _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",

    "<S> we present the first high resolution x - ray image of the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc  3226 . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained during an observation of the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc  3227 using the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. we detect a point x - ray source spatially consistent with the optical nucleus of ngc  3226 and a recently - detected , compact , flat - spectrum , radio source . the x - ray spectrum can be measured up to @xmath010  kev and is consistent with a power law with a photon index @xmath1 , or thermal bremmstrahlung emission with @xmath2  kev . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity in the 210  kev band @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find marginal evidence that the nucleus varies within the observation . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics support evidence from other wavebands that ngc  3226 harbors a low - luminosity , active nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on two previously - unknown , fainter x - ray sources @xmath4  arcsec from the nucleus of ngc  3226 . </S>",
    "<S> their proximity to the nucleus ( with projected distances @xmath5  kpc ) suggests both are within ngc  3226 , and thus have luminosities ( @xmath0few@xmath6few@xmath7 ) consistent with black - hole binary systems . </S>"
