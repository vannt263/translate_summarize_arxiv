    "with the advent of improved resolution , both in energy and momentum , several angular resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) groups have measured the renormalized quasiparticle energies and/or lifetimes in the cuprates .",
    "the data shows that a definite energy scale exists for the renormalization .",
    "this energy scale has tentatively been assigned by some@xcite to interactions of the charge carriers with phonons .",
    "this provocative possibility has again brought to the forefront the open question of mechanism in the cuprates and in particular the possibility that the electron - phonon interaction plays an important role . while the electron - phonon interaction is widely believed to cause superconductivity in conventional materials ,",
    "the gap symmetry in the cuprates is @xmath3-wave@xcite rather than @xmath4-wave which means that it is the projection of the electron phonon interaction on the @xmath3-channel which enters the equation for the critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this would imply that some of the details of the electron - phonon interaction would be drastically different in the oxides compared to conventional metals .",
    "while conventional superconductors do exhibit anisotropy@xcite in their superconducting gap as a function of momentum * k * on the fermi surface , the @xmath4-channel always overcomes the @xmath3-channel interaction .",
    "also in dirty @xmath4-wave materials with the mean free path @xmath6 smaller than the coherence length @xmath7 , the anisotropy is washed out and the gap becomes isotropic . on the other hand , in the pure limit",
    "there are many ways in which this gap anisotropy manifests itself in a conventional superconductor.@xcite one example is the low temperature @xmath8 electronic specific heat which exhibits the expected exponential dependence @xmath9 only for temperatures much lower than the lowest gap @xmath10 in the system",
    ".    arguments for why the form of the electron - phonon interaction can be very different in the oxides as compared with conventional metals have been presented in the literature .",
    "some of the critical ideas have been reviewed by kuli.@xcite the main argument for our purpose here is that the electron - phonon interaction becomes strongly peaked in the forward direction when corrections for strong correlations are properly accounted for through charge vertices.@xcite another related idea is that because of the large static dielectric function in the oxides the screening is greatly reduced as compared with ordinary metals .",
    "this also leads to enhanced forward scattering as can be seen@xcite from the following simple argument .",
    "the fourier transform of the bare coulomb potential diverges like @xmath11 for small * q * , here * q * is the momentum transfer .",
    "screening eliminates this singularity and the screened potential goes , instead , like @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an inverse screening length . for small @xmath13",
    "the increased forward scattering has the general tendency of increasing the weighting of the higher harmonics in its expansion .",
    "for example the expansion of a delta function @xmath14 has equal weight in each spherical harmonics.@xcite strong forward scattering can in fact lead to @xmath3-wave superconductivity which is not suppressed by the strong coulomb repulsion in contrast to the @xmath4-wave channel.@xcite    while the possibility of phonon induced @xmath3-wave superconductivity can not be eliminated on general grounds , it has not been favored in much of the literature . while there is no consensus on mechanism ,",
    "many workers believe instead in an electronically driven scenario : for instance , the @xmath15 model can exhibit superconductivity.@xcite a spin fluctuation mechanism , such as is envisaged in the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( naffl ) model of pines and coworkers@xcite is also electronic in nature with the exchange of spin fluctuations rather than phonons .",
    "another electronic mechanism is the marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) model@xcite which in its original form had @xmath4-wave symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to understand the renormalization effect observed in arpes within a boson exchange mechanism . we will consider explicitly both , phonon and spin fluctuation exchange .",
    "we will also try to reconcile within the same model , both , arpes data on equilibrium quasiparticle properties and the optical conductivity .",
    "infrared measurements in the cuprates have produced a wealth of information on charge dynamics in the oxides .",
    "they have played a key role in our present understanding of the microscopic nature of the cuprates . in particular , @xmath16-axis infrared conductivity data have given detailed spectroscopic information on the pseudogap@xcite which has been widely viewed as a direct manifestation of strong correlation effects .",
    "recently , improvements in resolution have also been achieved in @xmath17-plane measurements.@xcite    from reflectance measurements as a function of frequency it is possible to extract separately the real and the imaginary part of the conductivity @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 for a fixed temperature @xmath20 . within a generalized drude model ,",
    "in which the optical scattering rate and optical effective mass acquire a frequency dependence , we can define an isotropic optical scattering time @xmath21 as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the plasma frequency .",
    "this quantity can be determined from the optical sum rule on the real part of @xmath18 , namely @xmath24 .",
    "the optical scattering rate defined above is related to the quasiparticle lifetime which may be considered to be more fundamental as they directly define quasiparticle motion . while these two lifetimes are related , they are by no means identical , however , except for a simplified case of isotropic elastic impurity scattering . even in this case , if the electronic density of states has an important dependence on energy or the elastic scattering is anisotropic , quasiparticle and transport scattering rates are no longer the same . note that , in as much as the in - plane conductivity is isotropic , the optical scattering rate is also isotropic and represents a weighted average of the more fundamental momentum dependent quasiparticle scattering .",
    "while there have been some attempts in the literature@xcite to compare both sets of data , i.e. : arpes and optical directly , we will emphasize here that , because they are not so simply related , they can not easily be compared . on the other hand ,",
    "any viable microscopic model needs to be able to provide a unifying description of both sets of experiments . in this regard",
    ", we will emphasize that in addition to the differences between quasiparticle and transport scattering rate which we have already discussed , they differ in another fundamental way . in a boson exchange mechanism the charge carrier - exchange boson spectral density ( denoted by @xmath25 in the explicit case of phonons ) which describes",
    "the equilibrium properties can be quite different from the corresponding transport spectral density , usually denoted by @xmath26.@xcite the origin of this fundamental difference lies in a well - known factor @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angle between initial and final electron momentum undergoing a scattering process . for quasiparticle properties such as its lifetime , only the probability that an electron of momentum * k * leaves the state @xmath29 is relevant , while for transport , for instance for the d.c .",
    "resistivity , it is also important where it ends up since backward scattering depletes the current more than forward scattering .",
    "this basic physics is accounted for by the @xmath27 factor which eliminates forward scattering @xmath30 and weights with a factor two backward scattering @xmath31 .",
    "serious estimates@xcite of these two spectral densities for a model electron - phonon interaction in the poor screening regime with explicit inclusion of correlation effects , have lead to an estimate that @xmath26 may be smaller by about a factor of @xmath32 compared with @xmath25 , the corresponding quasiparticle quantity . on the other hand , in the naffl model",
    "the interaction with spin fluctuations is believed to strongly peak around @xmath33 in momentum .",
    "this means that the scattering potential itself weights more strongly the backward scattering processes , and so we expect that the transport spectral density will be larger than its quasiparticle counterpart .",
    "the above arguments immediately suggest that phonons effects could very well show up prominently in quasiparticle properties while at the same time play only a minor role in transport , i.e. : in the infrared conductivity and vice versa for spin fluctuations .    in section",
    "ii we make general remarks about the renormalization effects due to boson exchange mechanisms based on perturbation theory . in particular",
    "we contrast the electron - phonon case with spin fluctuations . in section",
    "iii we deal with fits to the arpes data in bi2212 and in section iv we consider , in addition , optical conductivity data .",
    "we describe the constraints on microscopic models that a fit to both sets of data imposes in the specific case of bi2212 . in section",
    "v we draw conclusions .",
    "for an electron - phonon system , the renormalization of the electronic quasiparticles follows from a knowledge of the electron - phonon spectral density @xmath25 . this function which depends only on frequency , and which is limited in range to the maximum phonon frequency , contains all of the complicated information about electronic band wave functions , dispersion relation , phonon dynamics , and electron - lattice vibration coupling which is needed to compute self energy effects . in lowest order perturbation theory ,",
    "the quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath34 at energy @xmath19 is given by@xcite @xmath35 for a @xmath36-function einstein phonon at @xmath37 of the form @xmath38 @xmath39 and we see that @xmath37 sets the energy at which @xmath40 jumps from zero to a finite value . for an @xmath25 distributed in energy , the rise will be more gradual but for @xmath41 , with the debye energy @xmath42 , the scattering rate will , again , become constant .    the expression for the optical scattering rate , on the other hand , which is also obtained in lowest order perturbation theory is@xcite @xmath43 which gives @xmath44 for @xmath45 in an einstein model , but now for @xmath46 @xmath47 which starts at zero with @xmath48 and gradually increases towards @xmath49 with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "this is quite distinct from the abrupt jump to @xmath50 at @xmath48 found for the quasiparticle scattering rate . here the subscript ` @xmath51 ' denotes transport as opposed to equilibrium properties .",
    "it is clear that the singularity in @xmath52 associated with the boson energy scale @xmath37 is more significant in the quasiparticle ( equilibrium case ) than in the transport scattering rate .",
    "there is yet another difference between quasiparticle and transport rates .",
    "if we denote the electron - phonon interaction matrix element by @xmath53 for electrons scattering from * k * to @xmath54 with a phonon of energy @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is a branch index ) the quasiparticle spectral density is @xmath57 with the double average over the fermi surface denoted by @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the chemical potential , so all integrals are pinned at the fermi surface .",
    "the optical spectral weight is related@xcite instead to @xmath61 the extra factor of @xmath62 with @xmath63 the velocity of the electron * k * weights forward scattering by zero and emphasizes most backward collisions .",
    "the functions @xmath25 of eq .  ( [ eq:5 ] ) and @xmath26 of eq .  ( [ eq:7 ] ) are isotropic , momentum averages , given by the right hand side of each of these equations .",
    "both involve a double integral over initial and final states @xmath29 and @xmath64 . the full complicated momentum dependence of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath53 and of the phonon dispersion @xmath55 is included with no approximations , although after the double summation over momentum , indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) , @xmath25 is now isotropic , dependent only on frequency .",
    "this is the function that enters isotropic eliashberg theory .",
    "an anisotropic formulation of the eliashberg equations@xcite also exists and in this case a directional electron - phonon spectral density distinct for each electron state @xmath29 on the fermi surface , which we denote by @xmath65 , would replace its fermi surface average : @xmath66 to calculate @xmath25 from first principles is difficult and complex.@xcite it can , fortunately , be measured directly from tunneling data through consideration of current voltage characteristics.@xcite the resulting function of @xmath19 often , but not always , looks qualitatively very much like the phonon frequency distribution @xmath67 but this does not imply that momentum dependence of coupling and/or of phonons is not included in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "any nesting effects such as are present in the nested fermi liquid theory of virosztek and ruvalds@xcite and in the work of savrasov and andersen@xcite are fully incorporated on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "it is only because we take the left hand side from experiment that these important issues do not become prominent in our work .",
    "a further complication arises in the case of coupling to spin fluctuations.@xcite in this case the magnetic spin susceptibility @xmath68 is involved as well as its coupling to charge .",
    "the susceptibility in the cuprates is sharply peaked in momentum space at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath69 ( momentum transfer ) for electron scattering from @xmath29 to @xmath64 . in this case , what enters eliashberg theory@xcite is the complex function @xmath68 weighted by electron coupling .",
    "for instance , in the naffl model@xcite @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 the static susceptibility , @xmath73 the magnetic coherence length , @xmath74 the commensurate antiferromagnetic momentum , and @xmath75 the characteristic energy of the spin fluctuations at the point * q*. a fermi surface to fermi surface approximation does not naturally reveal itself since this may not include transitions with @xmath76 for which the susceptibility is the largest .",
    "however , one can still introduce , as an approximation , some average effective electron - spin fluctuation spectral function denoted by @xmath77 which can be used in the isotropic version of the eliashberg equations .",
    "it represents the appropriate average of the susceptibility that enters superconductivity .",
    "its value is to be determined from consideration of experimental data . as described by carbotte _",
    "et al._@xcite this isotropic spectral density is given by the second derivative of @xmath19 times the optical scattering rate @xmath78 .",
    "recall , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the in - plane optical conductivity .",
    "this conductivity is isotropic in tetragonal systems . for the orthorhombic case , @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be different . defining @xmath83 the approximate relation @xmath84 holds.@xcite we emphasize that in terms of microscopic theory @xmath85 is related to an appropriate average of the full momentum and energy spin susceptibility @xmath68 ( eq .  ) .",
    "recently , infrared optical data has been used very effectively to obtain @xmath86 in the oxides and we will use these in our work . in this way",
    "we circumvent all of the complications that would arise in a first principle calculation of the average effective function @xmath86 .",
    "we will return to this important point later in equation ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that @xmath85 very often exhibits a pronounced resonance like structure particularly if @xmath87 data at low temperatures in the superconducting state is analyzed . in the following we use the expression ` optical resonance ' in reference to such a structure . in most materials analyzed so far",
    ", this optical resonance has a spin resonance equivalent measured using inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .    in some sense the opposite extreme to the naffl model of pines and coworkers@xcite",
    "in which the interaction peaks at @xmath33 is the mfl model of varma _",
    "et al._@xcite in which the interaction with the fluctuation spectrum is thought of as momentum independent in a first approximation .",
    "as originally conceived , this model leads to an @xmath4-wave superconducting gap rather than @xmath3-wave as is now generally believed to be the case .",
    "this represents a real limitation for the model .",
    "nevertheless , it has been very useful in correlating much data on the normal state transport properties in the cuprates .    in as much as it is only the magnitude and energy dependence of the resulting average spectral function @xmath25 ( @xmath77 ) that matter",
    ", these may not be very different between the mfl and naffl models .",
    "both have an average spectral density which is reasonably flat as a function of energy and which extends to some high frequency of order several hundred mev .",
    "of course , if anisotropies on the fermi surface were to be considered , the directional @xmath65 ( @xmath88 ) , eq .  , would be expected to vary strongly in the naffl model and not in the mfl model , but here , for simplicity , we have assigned to each electron the same average interaction . for phonons in conventional metals",
    "the mass renormalization parameter @xmath89 can vary by several tens of percentage points over the fermi surface.@xcite for the naffl model based on the susceptibility , the variations are much larger , and can be of the order of a factor of two or three.@xcite it is clear that arpes data in a particular direction could considerably under or overestimate the average renormalizations . in this sense optics",
    "is better .",
    "we should make one further remark . in conventional materials for which @xmath25 and @xmath26 have been calculated from band structure and phonon information usually obtained by inelastic neutron scattering , they have been found to differ in shape as a function of @xmath19 and in size .",
    "but these differences have often been overlooked in the literature . in the work of kuli and zeyher",
    "@xcite the corresponding differences are large .",
    "these authors considered directly the cuprates and try to account seriously for the ionicity and the increased effect of correlations .",
    "as described in the introduction , they find that the electron - phonon interaction in this case is strongly peaked in the forward direction and this leads to large differences between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they estimate @xmath25 to be about a factor of three larger than @xmath26 .",
