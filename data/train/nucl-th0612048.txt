    "the existence of the pion was predicted by yukawa @xcite in 1935 and discovered in the comsic ray spectrum by powell @xcite in 1947 .",
    "seventy years later one would have thought that of all reactions , pion production in proton proton collisions was thoroughly understood .",
    "there has been considerable interest recently in meson production from nucleon nucleon collisions near the meson production threshold @xcite .",
    "pion production has been studied in the most detail .",
    "the reason these studies raised such interest was because the first calculations of total cross sections disagreed with experiment by a factor of five @xcite and the differential cross sections for spin observables had the wrong shape , being convex instead of concave @xcite .",
    "particle reaction transport codes , such as geant @xcite and fluka @xcite are widely used in the design of accelerator experiments and the simulation of particle detectors . while typical cross sections away from threshold reach tens of millibarn , the cross sections near threshold are about a thousand times smaller , typically in the microbarn region .",
    "the fact that theory and experiment disagreed so much in the threshold region was therefore of no real concern for particle simulation codes because the cross sections in the threshold region are so small .",
    "transport codes are also widely used in studies of cosmic rays .",
    "if one knows the cosmic ray spectrum incident on top of the earth s atmosphere , then one can deduce the cosmic ray spectrum observed on the ground by transporting through the atmosphere .",
    "similarly if one knows the cosmic ray spectrum incident on a spacecraft wall then one can deduce the radiation environment inside a spacecraft @xcite .",
    "in cosmic ray research one turns this around to deduce the incident spectrum from knowledge of the ground based spectrum .",
    "transport codes are concerned with solving the boltzmann transport equation . in the continuous",
    "slowing down and straight - ahead approximations , the one dimensional boltzmann equation can be expressed @xcite as @xmath0   \\phi_j(x , e )    = \\int de^\\prime \\sum_k \\sigma_{jk}(e , e^\\prime ) \\phi_k(x , e^\\prime)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where s(e ) is the stopping power , @xmath1 is the macroscopic cross section and @xmath2 is the flux of particles at a given depth @xmath3 and energy @xmath4 .",
    "the macroscopic cross section is related to the microscopic cross section @xmath5 by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the target number density .",
    "note that the flux @xmath2 is multiplied by the cross section @xmath5 . in a particle accelerator , the incident flux is normally a beam ( constant flux ) of particles with a well defined energy .",
    "in cosmic ray physics the incident flux is represented by the incident cosmic ray spectrum , which is discussed in the review by simpson @xcite . in figure 5a of that review",
    "one can find the incident spectrum for protons and other nuclei .",
    "the peak of the spectrum occurs at an energy of about 300 mev .",
    "the peak is caused by solar modulation of the interplanetary magnetic field and is known to move around somewhat depending on solar activity . note that the peak of the spectrum occurs quite near the pion production threshold of 290 mev .",
    "this is an interesting accident of nature . above this energy",
    "the spectrum starts falling .",
    "now the boltzmann equation contains flux multiplied by cross section .",
    "therefore just because a cross section is small does not mean that it is unimportant .",
    "a small cross section might get multiplied by a large flux and a large cross section might get multiplied by a small flux , leading to approximately equal contributions from a transport point of view .",
    "this is possible when the incident flux is the cosmic ray spectrum at the top of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "consider the exlusive reaction for production of neutral pions , @xmath8 sample values of cosmic ray proton flux @xcite and microscopic cross section are given in table 1 , where the values are also multiplied together ( we call this _ importance _ ) , as in the boltzmann equation",
    ". it can be seen that the small cross sections near threshold can be of similar importance to larger cross sections away from threshold , the reason being due to the fact that the cosmic ray spectrum has a peak near threshold and falls steadily at higher energies .",
    "for example , the cross section at 375 mev is 40 @xmath9b , while the cross section at 7 gev is 1.7 mb , yet they give approximately equal contribution to the importance factor .",
    "of course these do not compare to the importance of the cross sections at say 700 mev and 1 gev .",
    "however in a good transport code one will always include the cross section at a variety of energies and one would certainly go out to 7 gev .",
    "the point is that if one does include such higher energy cross sections , then one may also need to include the cross sections near threshold as well because they are of comparable importance . + * table 1 . * neutral pion production from proton - proton collisions .",

    "based on the above considerations , one might ask about the subthreshold pion production observed in nucleus - nucleus collisions some decades ago @xcite . here",
    "the word subthreshold refers to pions produced in nuclear collisions where the nucleus kinetic energy is below the nucleon - nucleon threshold .",
    "the typical way to express energies in nucleus - nucleus collisions is using a mev .",
    "an energy of 290 a mev would represent the nucleon - nucleon threshold .",
    "simpson @xcite also provides the cosmic ray spectrum for nuclei , such as he , c , fe .",
    "again the spectrum peak for these nuclei is right near the pion threshold .",
    "if the peak were below the pion threshold then sub - threshold pion production in nuclear collisions would be important for the same reasons as given above .",
    "however because the nuclear peaks remain near the pion threshold then subthreshold pion production is not important in the sense described previously .",
    "this can be seen from table 3 where total cross sections for neutral pion production in carbon - carbon collisions below the pion threshold are presented .",
    "due to a lack of total cross section data , the experimental cross sections without reference numbers next to them were taken from table 1 and multiplied by 144 , which is the product of the mass numbers of the projectile and target nuclei .",
    "therefore they are approximate only . again",
    "these cross sections are multiplied by the carbon cosmic ray flux and it can be seen that sub - threshold cross sections are not important compared to cross sections at higher energies .",

    "the percent flux difference of charged muons and pions in the mars atmosphere @xcite at a depth of 38.9 @xmath37 from the 1977 gcr spectrum @xcite",
    "we have added this section on the advice of a referee , who wished us to do a sample transport calculation by artificially multiplying the cross section near threshold by a factor of two to see what the effects might be .",
    "the transport calculation was done with mestrn @xcite , an extension of the nasa transport code hzetrn @xcite that includes the production of charged pions and muons .",
    "one improvement that was made to the published version of mestrn is the pion production spectral distributions from proton - proton collisions are now calculated by numerically integrating the lorentz invariant differential cross sections of badwar _",
    "this was done to achieve better numerical convergence for low density materials and to allow for transport through variable density materials .",
    "the martian atmospheric model of de angelis _ et al . _ @xcite and the primary galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) model of badwar and oneill @xcite were used as inputs for the transport calculation .",
    "two runs of the transport code were performed . for one run , the cross section for the production of pions was artificially multiplied by a factor of two from threshold to a kinetic energy of 2 gev .",
    "figure 1 shows the percent flux difference of charged pions and muons after transport through 38.9 @xmath37 of martian atmosphere corresponding to an approximate altitude of -10 km .",
    "a negative altitude indicates a valley or impact basin .",
    "the percent flux difference is the flux of the mestrn run with the cross section for pion production enhanced by a factor of two minus the nonenhanced flux .",
    "this value is then divided by the nonenhanced flux to give the percent variation due to the enhancement of the pion production cross section near threshold .",
    "the enhanced pion production cross sections led to an enhanced flux of charged pions and muons by approximately 20 - 30% in the kinetic energy region up to 1 gev .",
    "the enhancement fades quickly after 1 gev .",
