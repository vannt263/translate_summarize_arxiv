    "finally , the lower right panel of figure [ nomotof5 ] shows that he  i @xmath6810830 , with a optical depth at the photosphere of 0.9 , can account for the 1.0  @xmath67 m feature without causing any obvious problems . by this process of elimination , hatano et al .",
    "@xcite find that the most likely identification of the 1.0  @xmath67 m feature in sn  2000cx is he  i @xmath6810830 .",
    "the evidence for helium in sn  2000cx , although not conclusive , is strong enough to be taken seriously .      both l01 and r02 suggest a delayed detonation as a favorable model for sn 2000cx .",
    "in particular , r02 argued that the 1.0  @xmath67 m feature is due to mg ii and the presence of such high velocity mg as @xmath6 20,000 km s@xmath12  supports the delayed detonation model .",
    "however , this argument does not hold if the 1.0  @xmath67 m feature is due to he i. rather the delayed detonation models do not contain such high velocity he ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the presence of he , instead , may suggest the sub - chandrasekhar model for sn 2000cx . in the sub - chandrasekhar mass models ,",
    "the he detonation in the outer he layer synthesize mostly @xmath38ni but significant amount of he is also present due to strong @xmath22-rich freezeout @xcite .",
    "the velocities of he are @xmath11 11,000 - 14,000 km s@xmath12  near the bottom of the he layer and @xmath11 25,000 - 30,000 km s@xmath12  near the surface , depending on @xmath1 and the mass of the he layer ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the he velocities and the @xmath38ni mass of sn 2000cx could be consistent with the model with relatively large @xmath1 and @xmath71 . in",
    "the outer detonated layers , little si is produced , which is also consistent with the weak si features of sn 2000cx .",
    "the presence of high velocity he with @xmath38ni ( and little si ) is also seen in the late detonation model w7dhe of the chandrasekhar mass white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the explosion of this type would occur for slower accretion than the sub - chandrasekhar mass explosion @xcite ."

    "<S> a key question for supernova cosmology is whether the peak luminosities of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galactic evolution . to answer this question , we review the currently popular scenario of sn ia progenitors , i.e. , the single degenerate scenario for the chandrasekhar mass white dwarf ( wd ) models . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the progenitor s evolution with two channels : ( 1 ) the wd+rg ( red - giant ) and ( 2 ) the wd+ms ( near main - sequence he - rich star ) channels . the strong wind from accreting wds plays a key role , which yields important age and metallicity effects on the evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction @xmath0(c ) in the c+o wd ( or the variation of the initial wd mass ) causes the diversity of sn ia brightness . </S>",
    "<S> this model can explain the observed dependence of sne ia brightness on the galaxy types . </S>",
    "<S> we then predict how sn ia brightness evolves along the redshift ( with changing metallicity and age ) for elliptical and spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> such evolutionary effects along the redshift can be corrected as has been made for local sne ia .    </S>",
    "<S> we also touch on several related issues : ( 1 ) the abundance pattern of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies in relation to the metallicity effect on sne ia , ( 2 ) effects of angular momentum brought into the wd in relation to the diversities and the fate of double degenerates , and ( 3 ) possible presence of helium in the peculiar sn ia 2000cx in relation to the sub - chandrasekhar mass model .    invited review published in `` from twilight to highlight : the physics of supernovae , '' eds . w. hillebrandt & b. leibundgut , eso / springer series `` eso astrophysics symposia '' ( berlin : springer ) p.115127(2003 ) . </S>"
