    "stochastic optimization for insurance business with investment control has been studied extensively in recent years . under the classical cramer - lundberg model ( compound poisson risk process ) , the problem of ruin minimization was first considered in hipp and plum @xcite , where the investment control is unconstrained and the investment amount in the risky asset can be at any level .",
    "more recently , azcue and muler @xcite studied the same model with a borrowing constraint that restricts the ratio of borrowed amount to the surplus level to invest in the risky asset .",
    "in belkina et al .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered the problem with a restriction that the investment ( purchase or short - sell ) in the risky asset is allowed only within a limited proportion of the surplus . in gaier ,",
    "grandits and schachermayer @xcite , and hipp and schmidli @xcite , for the case with zero interest and light tailed claims , asymptotic behavior of the ruin probability was investigated and convergence of the optimal investment level was proved as the surplus tends to infinity . in frolova et .",
    "@xcite , for the case with exponential claims , a power function approximation of the ruin probability was provided under the assumption that all surplus is invested in the risky asset . in gaier and grandits",
    "@xcite , @xcite , for claims with regularly varying tails , and in grandits @xcite , schmidli @xcite and eisenberg @xcite , for sub - exponential claims , certain asymptotic properties of the ruin probability and the optimal investment amount were obtained .",
    "other related research articles worked on more complex control forms with reinsurance and investment .",
    "for example , schmidli @xcite considered an unconstrained optimal reinsurance - investment control problem under the classical model .",
    "taksar and markussen @xcite , luo @xcite and luo et al .",
    "@xcite studied the problem under the diffusion approximation model with various investment restrictions .",
    "one common extension of the compound poisson model considers brownian perturbation , which is known as the jump - diffusion model ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the surplus process is the sum of the classical risk process and a brownian motion . under this model , in zhang and yang @xcite , a general objective function was studied with unconstrained investment control and numerical methods to compute the optimal investment strategy were discussed . in gerber and yang @xcite ,",
    "absolute ruin probability was considered .",
    "laubis and lin @xcite showed a limiting expression for the ruin probability function which is a power function under the assumptions that investment amount is a fixed fraction of the surplus and that the insurance claims are exponential . in lin @xcite , an exponential upper bound for the minimal ruin probability",
    "was obtained and numerical calculations revealing the relationships between the adjustment coefficient and model parameters were conducted . in a surplus model with stochastic interest rate , paulsen and gjessing @xcite studied the probability of eventual ruin and the time of ruin without investment control",
    ".    this paper studies the problem of ruin probability minimization with investment control .",
    "we consider the perturbed compound poisson surplus model and assume positive interest rate as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the surplus can be invested into a risky asset ( stock ) and a risk - free asset , where the risky asset price follows a geometric brownian motion .",
    "we consider two cases of investment . in the first case",
    ", we assume that there is no restriction on the investment ( see , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "that is , the investment amount in the risky asset can be at any level .",
    "note that short - selling of the risky asset is allowed at any level in this case . in the second case ,",
    "we assume that the investment amount in the risky asset is no more than a fixed level @xmath0 and short - selling the stock is not allowed .",
    "this restriction is set to reduce leveraging level of the insurer which was considered in e.g. @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the goal is to minimize the probability of ruin .",
    "the minimal ruin probability function is characterized by an integro - differential hjb equation as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hjb equation has a classical solution and it can be shown that the minimal ruin probability function is proportional to the solution by a verification result .",
    "we summarize three main contributions of this paper .",
    "first , we define novel operators to prove the existence of a classical solution to the hjb equation in the two investment cases .",
    "these operators provide an alternative method to compute the optimal investment strategy and the minimal ruin probability ( see numerical examples in the last section ) .",
    "second , we give asymptotic results on the optimal investment strategy and the minimal ruin function for low surplus levels . in the unconstrained case , we find that when the surplus level approaches to @xmath1 , the optimal investment amount tends to a fixed non - zero value , in contrast to the model without perturbation in @xcite and @xcite , where the optimal investment level tends to zero as surplus tends to @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we find the rate at which the optimal investment amount converges to the non - zero level .",
    "asymptotic results near @xmath1 for the minimal ruin function are also studied . in the constrained case",
    ", we find close interplay between the model parameters and the optimal investment control .",
    "we give parameter conditions under which the optimal investment amount takes values @xmath1",
    ", @xmath0 , or a certain level in between respectively when the surplus is low .",
    "note that all these asymptotic results are obtained for an arbitrary claim size distribution .",
    "third , in the special case with an exponential claim distribution , we prove some new asymptotic results for large surplus levels .",
    "we show that the optimal investment amount has a finite limit when surplus tends to infinity .",
    "we also show that the minimal ruin probability function has a limiting expression that is the product of an exponential function and a power function as surplus tends to infinity .",
    "we note that these new limiting results ( of the optimal investment problem with exponential claims ) hold also in the classical model without perturbation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we formulate the optimization problem . in section 3 , we prove existence of the classical optimal solution and give asymptotic results in the constrained case . in section 4 , we study the unconstrained case . in section 5 , we investigate the model when the claim size is exponential . numerical examples and concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
