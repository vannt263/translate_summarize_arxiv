    "the small mode volume of evanescent field atom traps engenders strong atom - light interactions without the need for a cavity  @xcite .",
    "the recent demonstrations of trapping @xmath3cs with an optical nanofiber ( onf )  @xcite - and a state - insensitive variant  @xcite mark an important experimental realization of these systems .",
    "their high optical depth ( @xmath4 ) allows for efficient dispersive readout  @xcite and strong nonlinear interactions , and they could potentially realize collective effects such as superradiance  @xcite . the success of onf traps has inspired a growing effort to trap atoms in the evanescent field of nanophotonic waveguides  @xcite .",
    "this regime of strong coupling opens the door to the study of long - range interactions and the formation of so - called atomic mirrors  @xcite , the observation of self - crystallization  @xcite , or the generation of a sub - poissonian atom number distribution  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , low loss onfs  @xcite have been proposed as one of steps toward the realization of a hybrid quantum system coupling photons to atoms to superconducting circuit elements  @xcite .",
    "optical dipole trapping of atoms is a well - developed technology applied to numerous atomic species .",
    "the extension of optical trapping to evanescent fields of an onf shares similarities with dipole trapping with free space beams , but has one distinction - the evanescent field may have a substantial longitudinally polarized component of the electric field .",
    "this can lead to surprisingly large differences in the absorption of probe light for two different species , even when they are both alkali atoms ( e.g. rb and cs ) , due to the effects of the vector light shift .",
    "our system traps atoms with two lasers , achieving trap depths of a few hundreds of microkelvin .",
    "we can not simply determine atom number by the absorption of a probe beam by an optically thick medium with a lorentzian line shape .",
    "distinct asymmetries are observed that we trace to the effects of the vector light shifts associated with the optical trapping fields , and their inherent elliptical polarization with an appreciable component along the direction of propagation .",
    "although rb and cs are nominally atoms with very similar atomic structure , the light shifts can in fact be quite different , with differential light shifts much larger in rb than cs , leading to a modified absorption profile .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "our system consists of the main science chamber ( msc ) with the antechamber ( ac ) equipped with a precision vacuum manipulator ( vm ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_setup ] .",
    "we transfer onfs from the antechamber to the science chamber without breaking the science chamber vacuum .",
    "the science chamber maintains a pressure of @xmath5 mbar with two ion pumps ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we produce the onf by thinning a single - mode fiber ( fibercore ) in an in - lab setup  @xcite .",
    "the onfs typically have greater than 99% transmission for waists with diameters of 500 nm and lengths from 1 mm to 10 cm .",
    "the data presented in this paper are taken using an onf with a waist of  530 nm diameter and 7 mm length , with a tapering region of 39 mm in length .",
    "the produced onf epoxied onto the titanium alloy fiber holder ( fh ) is held on the vacuum manipulator rod ( vmr ) at the antechamber and is transfered to the science chamber .",
    "the mounted onf is extended to the out - of - vacuum patch - cord single - mode fiber via the teflon ferrule fiber feedthrough ( ff ) with a swagelok .",
    "a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) loaded from a background vapor of @xmath0 produces a cloud of @xmath7 atoms .",
    "we overlap the cloud with the onf waist using magnetic field shim coils and the vacuum manipulator ( vg scienta transax ) with 2-d manual translation stages ( ts ) .",
    "two orthogonal imaging systems ensure alignment .",
    "atoms are loaded into the onf trap ( left on throughout the experiment ) after 90ms of increased mot detuning and a 1ms duration optical molasses stage .",
    "the sub - doppler cooling during this loading stage yields mot temperatures of @xmath8 , as determined by time - of - flight measurements .",
    "an onf trap requires light tuned red of resonance ( with respect to to the @xmath9rb d2 line ) to provide an attractive potential and light tuned blue of resonance to prevent atoms from striking the onf surface .",
    "a 750-nm wavelength laser ( coherent ti : sa 899 ) provides the repulsive force , and a 1064-nm wavelength beam ( jdsu npro ) in a standing wave configuration ( to provide longitudinal confinement ) provides the attractive potential .",
    "a potential minimum of 370@xmath10 in depth is formed @xmath11215 nm from the fiber surface , and the trapping frequencies are calculated to be ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) = ( 253 , 371 , 104)khz .",
    "all of the onf trapping beams and the near - resonant probe beam are intensity - stabilized .",
    "the amplitude lock of the probe beam includes a sample - and - hold to stabilize the power in between pulses so that the servo can rapidly recapture when the pulse is turned on , minimizing transients .",
    "we measure atomic absorption with a weak , near - resonance beam ( 780 nm ) coupled through the onf , counting transmitted photons with avalanche photodiodes ( apd , laser components count-250c - fc ) operating in geiger mode .",
    "because light levels near 10pw saturate the apds , great care must be taken to filter stray light and maintain low probe power .",
    "three narrow - line volume bragg gratings ( vbg , optigrate bp-785 , 0.18 nm spectral bandwidth at 785 nm ) filter amplified spontaneous emission from the ti : sapphire laser near 780 nm . a vbg at the output of the nanofiber serves as a mirror to direct signal to the apds and as another filter to block in - fiber background induced by the blue trapping beam .",
    "this light due to either fluorescence or raman scattering is the main source of background in the experiment .",
    "two more bandpass filters further reduce background counts , and finally long - pass color filters ( thorlabs , fgl645 ) directly in front of the apd fiber couplers reduce short - wavelength background from stray light .",
    "a series of differing optical depth neutral density filters before and after the nanofiber allow us to vary the probe intensity while keeping light levels within the dynamic range of the apds .",
    "ttl pulses from the apds are counted with a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) and processed to extract absorption signals and full photon counting statistics .",
    "rb atoms , the standing waves with nd : yag laser ( 1064 nm ) and the travelling wave with ti : sapphire laser ( 750 nm ) create a nanofiber atom trap .",

    "these are too low in frequency to produce heating as it would be adiabatic motion in terms of the optical trapping potential .",
    "though this is far away from any relevant trap frequency , the acceleration of the fiber may be high enough at times to affect loading , as the macroscopic motion of the trap is no longer adiabatic relative to the mean atomic motion .",

    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate optical trapping of @xmath0 atoms using a two - color evanescent field around an optical nanofiber . in our trapping geometry , a blue - detuned traveling wave </S>",
    "<S> whose polarization is nearly parallel to the polarization of a red - detuned standing wave produces significant vector light shifts that lead to broadening of the absorption profile of a near - resonant beam at the trapping site . </S>",
    "<S> a model that includes scalar , vector , and tensor light shifts of the probe transition @xmath1-@xmath2 from the trapping beams , weighted by the temperature - dependent position of the atoms in the trap , qualitatively describes the observed asymmetric profile and explains differences with previous experiments that used cs atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the model provides a consistent way to extract the number of atoms in the trap . </S>"
