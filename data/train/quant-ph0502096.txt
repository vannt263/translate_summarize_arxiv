    "because of its mathematical simplicity , the harmonic oscillator provides soluble models in many branches of physics .",
    "it often gives a clear illustration of abstract ideas . in many cases ,",
    "the problems are reduced to the problem of two coupled oscillators .",
    "soluble models in quantum field theory , such as the lee model  @xcite and the bogoliubov transformation in superconductivity  @xcite , are based on two coupled oscillators .",
    "recently , two coupled oscillators formed the mathematical basis for squeezed states in quantum optics  @xcite , especially two - mode squeezed states@xcite .",
    "more recently , it was noted by giedke _",
    "that entanglement realized in two - mode squeezed states can be formulated in terms of symmetric gaussian states  @xcite . from a mathematical point of view , the subject of entanglement has been largely a physics of two - by - two matrices .",
    "it is gratifying to note that harmonic oscillators can also play a role in clarifying the physical basis of entanglement .",
    "the symmetric gaussian states can be constructed from two coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "the entanglement issues in two - mode squeezed states can therefore be added to the physics of coupled harmonic oscillators . since",
    "many physical models are based on coupled oscillators , entanglement ideas can be exported to all those models .    in this paper , we construct a model of lorentz - covariant harmonic oscillators based on the coupled oscillators . since the covariance requires coupling of space and time variables , the covariant oscillator formalism allows expansion of entanglement ideas to the space - time region .",
    "combining quantum mechanics with special relativity is a fundamental problem in its own right",
    ". why do we need covariant harmonic oscillators while there is quantum field theory with feynman diagrams ?",
    "since this is also a fundamental problem by its own right , we would like to address this issue in the first sections of this paper .",
    "the point is that quantum mechanics deals with waves .",
    "there are running waves and standing waves .",
    "the present form of quantum mechanics and its s - matrix formalism are only for running waves , and can not directly deal with standing waves satisfying boundary conditions .",
    "of course standing waves are superpositions of two running waves , but we do not know how to approach this problem when we include lorentz transformations .",
    "the simplest approach is to work with a soluble model based on harmonic oscillators and two - by - two matrices .    from the mathematical point of view , special relativity is a physics of lorentz transformations or the lorentz group .",
    "it is gratifying to note that the six - parameter lorentz group can be represented by two - by - two matrices with unit determinant .",
    "the elements can be complex numbers .",
    "this group is known as @xmath1 which forms the universal covering group of the lorentz group .",
    "thus , special relativity is a physics of two - by - two matrices .",
    "the standard approach to two coupled oscillators is to construct a two - by - two matrix of two oscillators with different frequencies .",
    "thus , it is not surprising to note that the mathematics of the coupled oscillators is directly applicable to lorentz - covariant harmonic oscillators .",
    "therefore , the covariant oscillators , defined in the space - time region , can be enriched by the physics of entanglement .",
    "as for using coupled harmonic oscillators for combining quantum mechanics with relativity , we examine in this paper the earlier attempts made by dirac and feynman .",
    "we first examine dirac s approach which was to construct mathematically appealing models .",
    "we then examine how feynman approached this problem .",
    "he observed the experimental world , told the story of the real world in his style , and then wrote down mathematical formulas as needed .",
    "we use coupled oscillators to combine dirac s approach and feynman s approach to construct the lorentz - covariant formulation of quantum mechanics .    in sec .",
    "[ scabo ] , it is noted that quantum mechanics deals with waves , and there are running waves and standing waves . while it is somewhat straightforward to make running waves lorentz - covariant ,",
    "there are no established prescriptions for constructing standing waves consistent with special relativity .",
    "we stress in this section , why standing waves are different from running waves . in sec .",
    "[ quantu ] , we discuss the quantum mechanics of two coupled oscillators , and study how the system could absorb the physical ideas developed in the case of two - mode squeezed states .    in sec .",
    "[ dirosc ] , we study systematically dirac s lifetime efforts to combine quantum mechanics with relativity . he was concerned with space - time asymmetry associated with position - momentum and time - energy uncertainty relations .",
    "we examine carefully what more had to be done to complete the task initiated by dirac . in sec .",
    "[ feyosc ] , we study feynman s efforts to combine quantum mechanics with special relativity . here also , we carefully examine the short - comings in feynman s papers on harmonic oscillators",
    ". it is shown possible in sec .",
    "[ covham ] that the works of feynman and dirac can be combined to produce a covariant harmonic oscillator system . in sec .",
    "[ sten ] , it is shown that the covariant oscillator formalism shares the same mathematical base as that of two coupled oscillators , and much of the physical ideas , especially the entanglement idea , can be translated into the space - time variables of the lorentz - covariant world .",
    "the physics of space - time has its own merit , and is not bound to import ideas developed in other areas of physics . in sec .",
    "[ feydeco ] , we note that there is a dechorence effect observed first by feynman .",
    "it is known widely as feynman s parton picture in which partons appear like incoherent entities .",
    "it is widely believed that partons are lornents - boosted quarks .",
    "then , the question is how the lorentz boost , which is a space - time symmetry operation , can destroy coherence .",
    "we address this question in this section ,",
    "in this section , we would like to address the question of why we need covariant harmonic oscillators while there is the lorentz - covariant formulation of quantum field theory which allows us to calculate scattering amplitudes using feynman diagrams .",
    "when einstein formulated his special relativity one hundred years ago , he was considering point particles .",
    "einstein s energy - momentum relation is known to be valid also for particles with space - time extensions .",
    "there have been efforts to understand special relativity for rigid particles with non - zero size , without any tangible result . on the other hand",
    ", the emergence of quantum mechanics made the rigid - body problem largely irrelevant .",
    "thanks to wave - particle duality , we talk about wave packets and standing waves , instead of rigid bodies .",
    "the issue becomes whether those waves can be made lorentz - covariant .",
    "of course , here , the starting point is the plane wave , which can be written as @xmath2 since it takes the same form for all lorentz frames , we do not need any extra effort to make it lorentz covariant .",
    "indeed , the s - matrix derivable from the present form of quantum field theory calls for calculation of all s - matrix quantities in terms of plane waves .",
    "thus , the s - matrix is associated with perturbation theory or feynman diagrams .",
    "feynman propagators are written in terms of plane waves on the mass shell .",
    "we should realize however that the s - matrix formalism is strictly for running waves , starting from a plane wave from one end of the universe and ending with another plane wave at another end .",
    "how about standing waves ?",
    "this question is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dff11 ] . of course",
    ", standing waves can be regarded as superpositions of running waves moving in opposite directions . however , in order to guarantee localization of the standing waves , we need a spectral function or boundary conditions .",
    "the covariance of standing waves necessarily involves the covariance of boundary conditions or spectral functions .",
    "how much do we know about this problem ?",
    "this problem has not yet been systematically explored .    on the other hand ,",
    "some concrete models for covariant bound - states were studied in the past by a number of distinguished physicists , including paul a. m. dirac  @xcite , hideki yukawa  @xcite , and richard feynman and his co - authors  @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this problem in sec .",
    "[ dirosc ] .",
    "finally , let us see what kind of problems we expect if we use s - matrix methods for bound state problems .",
    "if we use the spherical coordinate system where the scattering center is at the origin , the s - matrix consists of both incoming and outgoing waves . if we make analytic continuations of these waves to bound states with negative total energy , the outgoing wave becomes localized , but the incoming wave increases to infinity at large distance from the origin , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ goodbad ] .",
    "there no methods of eliminating this unphysical wave function .",
    "indeed , this was the source of mistake made by dashen and frautschi in their once - celebrated calculation of the neutron and proton mass difference using an s - matrix formula corresponding to the first - order energy shift  @xcite .",
    "they used a pertubation formula derivable from s - matrix considerations , but their formula corresponds to the pertubation formula : @xmath3 where the good and bad bound - state wave functions are like @xmath4 for large values of @xmath5 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ goodbad ] .",
    "we are not aware of any s - matrix method which gurantees the localization of bound - state wave functions .",
    "the coupled oscillator problem can be formulated as that of a quadratic equation in two variables .",
    "the diagonalization of the quadratic form includes a rotation of the coordinate system .",
    "however , the diagonalization process requires additional transformations involving the scales of the coordinate variables  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was found that the mathematics of this procedure can be as complicated as the group theory of lorentz transformations in a six dimensional space with three spatial and three time coordinates  @xcite .    in this paper , we start with a simple problem of two identical oscillators",
    ". then the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath6 if we choose coordinate variables @xmath7 & { } & y_{2 } = { 1\\over\\sqrt{2}}\\left(x_{1 } - x_{2}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 & { } & \\exp(2\\eta ) = \\sqrt{\\frac{a - c}{a + c } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the classical eigenfrequencies are @xmath10 with @xmath11 .    if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are measured in units of @xmath14 , the ground - state wave function of this oscillator system is @xmath15 the wave function is separable in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 variables",
    "however , for the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the story is quite different , and can be extended to the issue of entanglement .",
    "there are three ways to excite this ground - state oscillator system .",
    "one way is to multiply hermite polynomials for the usual quantum excitations .",
    "the second way is to construct coherent states for each of the @xmath18 variables . yet",
    ", another way is to construct thermal excitations .",
    "this requires density matrices and wigner functions  @xcite .",
    "the key question is how the quantum mechanics in the world of the @xmath16 variable is affected by the @xmath17 variable .",
    "if we use two separate measurement processes for these two variables , these two oscillators are entangled .",

    "as was discussed in the literature for several different purposes  @xcite , this wave function can be expanded as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the normalized harmonic oscillator wave function for the @xmath24 excited state .",
    "this expansion serves as the mathematical basis for squeezed states of light in quantum optics  @xcite , among other applications .    the expansion given in eq.([expan1 ] )",
    "clearly demonstrates that the coupled oscillators are entangled oscillators .",
    "this expression is identical to eq.(1 ) of the recent paper by giedke _",
    "et al . _",
    "this means that the coupled oscillators can absorb most of the current entanglement issues , and serve as a reservior of entanglment ideas for other physical systems modeled after the coupled oscillators .",
    "we are particularly interested in expanding these ideas to relativistic space and time through the covariant oscillator formalism .    in sec",
    "[ dirosc ] , we shall see that the mathematics of the coupled oscillators can serve as the basis for the covariant harmonic oscillator formalism where the @xmath16 and @xmath17 variables are replaced by the longitudinal and time - like variables , respectively .",
    "this mathematical identity will lead to the concept of space - time entanglement in special relativity , as we shall see in sec .",
    "paul a. m. dirac is known to us through the dirac equation for spin-1/2 particles .",
    "but his main interest was in the foundational problems .",
    "first , dirac was never satisfied with the probabilistic formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "this is still one of the hotly debated subjects in physics .",
    "second , if we tentatively accept the present form of quantum mechanics , dirac was insisting that it has to be consistent with special relativity .",
    "he wrote several important papers on this subject .",
    "let us look at some of his papers .        during world war",
    "ii , dirac was looking into the possibility of constructing representations of the lorentz group using harmonic oscillator wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the lorentz group is the language of special relativity , and the present form of quantum mechanics starts with harmonic oscillators . presumably , therefore , he was interested in making quantum mechanics lorentz - covariant by constructing representations of the lorentz group using harmonic oscillators .    in his 1945 paper  @xcite ,",
    "dirac considered the gaussian form @xmath25 this gaussian form is in the @xmath26 coordinate variables .",
    "thus , if we consider lorentz boost along the @xmath27 direction , we can drop the @xmath28 and @xmath18 variables , and write the above equation as @xmath29 this is a strange expression for those who believe in lorentz invariance .",
    "the expression @xmath30 is not invariant under lorentz boost",
    ". therefore dirac s gaussian form of eq.([ground ] ) is not a lorentz - invariant expression .    on the other hand ,",
    "this expression is consistent with his earlier papers on the time - energy uncertainty relation  @xcite . in those papers",
    ", dirac observed that there is a time - energy uncertainty relation , while there are no excitations along the time axis .",
    "he called this the `` c - number time - energy uncertainty '' relation .",
    "when one of us ( ysk ) was talking with dirac in 1978 , he clearly mentioned this word again .",
    "he said further that this space - time asymmetry is one of the stumbling block in combining quantum mechanics with relativity .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ quantum ] .        in 1949 , the reviews of modern physics published a special issue to celebrate einstein s 70th birthday .",
    "this issue contains dirac paper entitled `` forms of relativistic dynamics ''  @xcite . in this paper",

    ", the transformation takes the form @xmath31 the light - cone variables are defined as  @xcite @xmath32 the boost transformation of eq.([boostm ] ) takes the form @xmath33 the @xmath34 variable becomes expanded while the @xmath35 variable becomes contracted , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ licone ] .",
    "their product @xmath36 remains invariant .",
    "in dirac s picture , the lorentz boost is a squeeze transformation .    if we combine fig .",
    "[ quantum ] and fig .",
    "[ licone ] , then we end up with fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] .",
    "this transformation changes the gaussian form of eq.([ground ] ) into @xmath37 let us go back to sec .",
    "[ quantu ] on the coupled oscillators .",
    "the above expression is the same as eq.([wf01 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath16 variable now became the longitudinal variable @xmath27 , and the @xmath17 variable became the time like variable @xmath38 .",
    "we can use the coupled harmonic oscillators as the starting point of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this allows us to translate the quantum mechanics of two coupled oscillators defined over the space of @xmath16 and @xmath17 into quantum mechanics defined over the space - time region of @xmath27 and @xmath38 .",
    "this form becomes ( [ ground ] ) when @xmath39 becomes zero .",
    "the transition from eq.([ground ] ) to eq.([eta ] ) is a squeeze transformation .",
    "it is now possible to combine what dirac observed into a covariant formulation of the harmonic oscillator system .",
    "first , we can combine his c - number time - energy uncertainty relation described in fig .",
    "[ quantum ] and his light - cone coordinate system of fig .",
    "[ licone ] into a picture of covariant space - time localization given in fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] .    the wave function of eq.([ground ] ) is distributed within a circular region in the @xmath40 plane , and thus in the @xmath41 plane . on the other hand , the wave function of eq.([eta ] )",
    "is distributed in an elliptic region with the light - cone axes as the major and minor axes respectively .",
    "if @xmath39 becomes very large , the wave function becomes concentrated along one of the light - cone axes .",
    "indeed , the form given in eq.([eta ] ) is a lorentz - squeezed wave function .",
    "this squeeze mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ellipse ] .",
    "there are two homework problems which dirac left us to solve .",
    "first , in defining the @xmath38 variable for the gaussian form of eq.([ground ] ) , dirac did not specify the physics of this variable .",
    "if it is going to be the calendar time , this form vanishes in the remote past and remote future .",
    "we are not dealing with this kind of object in physics .",
    "what is then the physics of this time - like @xmath38 variable ?",
    "the schrdinger quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom deals with localized probability distribution .",
    "indeed , the localization condition leads to the discrete energy spectrum . here",
    ", the uncertainty relation is stated in terms of the spatial separation between the proton and the electron .",
    "if we believe in lorentz covariance , there must also be a time - separation between the two constituent particles , and an uncertainty relation applicable to this separation variable .",
    "dirac did not say in his papers of 1927 and 1945 , but dirac s `` t '' variable is applicable to this time - separation variable .",
    "this time - separation variable will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ feyosc ] for the case of relativistic extended particles .",
    "second , as for the time - energy uncertainty relation , diracc concern was how the c - number time - energy uncertainty relation without excitations can be combined with uncertainties in the position space with excitations .",
    "how can this space - time asymmetry be consistent with the space - time symmetry of special relativity ?    both of these questions can be answered in terms of the space - time symmetry of bound states in the lorentz - covariant regime  @xcite . in his 1939 paper",
    "@xcite , wigner worked out internal space - time symmetries of relativistic particles .",
    "he approached the problem by constructing the maximal subgroup of the lorentz group whose transformations leave the given four - momentum invariant . as a consequence ,",
    "the internal symmetry of a massive particle is like the three - dimensional rotation group which does not require transformation into time - like space .",
    "if we extend wigner s concept to relativistic bound states , the space - time asymmetry which dirac observed in 1927 is quite consistent with einstein s lorentz covariance  @xcite .",
    "indeed , dirac s time variable can be treated separately .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to construct a representations of wigner s little group for massive particles  @xcite . as for the time - separation which can be linearly mixed with space - separation variables when",
    "the system is lorentz - boosted , it has its role in internal space - time symmetry .",
    "dirac s interest in harmonic oscillators did not stop with his 1945 paper on the representations of the lorentz group . in his 1963 paper  @xcite",
    ", he constructed a representation of the @xmath42 desitter group using two coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "this paper contains not only the mathematics of combining special relativity with the quantum mechanics of quarks inside hadrons , but also forms the foundations of two - mode squeezed states which are so essential to modern quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "dirac did not know this when he was writing this 1963 paper .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath42 desitter group contains the lorentz group @xmath43 as a subgroup .",
    "thus , dirac s oscillator representation of the desitter group essentially contains all the mathematical ingredient of what we are studying in this paper .",
    "in his invited talk at the 1970 spring meeting of the american physical society  @xcite , feynman was addressing hadronic mass spectra and a possible covariant formulation of harmonic oscillators .",
    "he noted that the mass spectra are consistent with degeneracy of three - dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "furthermore , feynman stressed that feynman diagrams are not necessarily suitable for relativistic bound states and that we should try harmonic oscillators .",
    "feynman s point was that , while plane - wave approximations in terms of feynman diagrams work well for relativistic scattering problems , they are not applicable to bound - state problems . we can summarize what feynman said in fig .",
    "[ goodbad ] and fig .",

    "this is of course due to the fact that we are averaging over the @xmath17 variable which we do not measure .",
    "the standard way to measure this ignorance is to calculate the entropy defined as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is measured in units of boltzmann s constant .",
    "if we use the density matrix given in eq.([dmat ] ) , the entropy becomes @xmath76 this expression can be translated into a more familiar form if we use the notation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the unit of energy spacing , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are boltzmann s constant and absolute temperature respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath81 is a dimensionless variable . in terms of this variable",
    ", the entropy takes the form  @xcite @xmath82 .\\ ] ] this familiar expression is for the entropy of an oscillator state in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus , for this oscillator system , we can relate our ignorance of the time - separation variable to the temperature .",
    "it is interesting to note that the boost parameter or coupling strength measured by @xmath39 can be related to a temperature variable .",
    "let us summarize . at this time ,",
    "the only theoretical tool available to this time - separation variable is through the space - time entanglement , which generate entropy coming from the rest of the universe .",
    "if the time - separation variable is not measured the entropy is one of the variables to be taken into account in the lorentz - covariant system .    in spite of our ignorance about this time - separation variable from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "its existence has been proved beyond any doubt in high - energy laboratories .",
    "we shall see in sec .",
    "[ feydeco].that it plays a role in producing a decoherence effect observed universally in high - energy laboratories .",
    "in a hydrogen atom or a hadron consisting of two quarks , there is a spacial separation between two constituent elements . in the case of the hydrogen we call it the bohr radius .",
    "it the atom or hadron is at rest , the time - separation variable does not play any visible role in quantum mechanics .",
    "however , if the system is boosted to the lorentz frame which moves with a speed close to that of light , this time - separation variable becomes as important as the space separation of the bohr radius .",
    "thus , the time - separation plays a visible role in high - energy physics which studies fast - moving bound states .",
    "let us study this problem in more detail .",
    "it is a widely accepted view that hadrons are quantum bound states of quarks having localized probability distribution . as in all bound - state cases",
    ", this localization condition is responsible for the existence of discrete mass spectra .",
    "the most convincing evidence for this bound - state picture is the hadronic mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "however , this picture of bound states is applicable only to observers in the lorentz frame in which the hadron is at rest . how would the hadrons appear to observers in other lorentz frames ?    in 1969 , feynman observed that a fast - moving hadron can be regarded as a collection of many `` partons '' whose properties do not appear to be quite different from those of the quarks  @xcite .",
    "for example , the number of quarks inside a static proton is three , while the number of partons in a rapidly moving proton appears to be infinite .",
    "the question then is how the proton looking like a bound state of quarks to one observer can appear different to an observer in a different lorentz frame ?",
    "feynman made the following systematic observations .",
    "* the picture is valid only for hadrons moving with velocity close to that of light . *",
    "the interaction time between the quarks becomes dilated , and partons behave as free independent particles .",
    "* the momentum distribution of partons becomes widespread as the hadron moves fast . *",
    "the number of partons seems to be infinite or much larger than that of quarks .",
    "because the hadron is believed to be a bound state of two or three quarks , each of the above phenomena appears as a paradox , particularly b ) and c ) together",
    ". how can a free particle have a wide - spread momentum distribution ?    in order to resolve this paradox , let us construct the momentum - energy wave function corresponding to eq.([eta ] ) .",
    "if the quarks have the four - momenta @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we can construct two independent four - momentum variables  @xcite @xmath85 the four - momentum @xmath86 is the total four - momentum and is thus the hadronic four - momentum .",
    "@xmath87 measures the four - momentum separation between the quarks .",
    "their light - cone variables are @xmath88 the resulting momentum - energy wave function is @xmath89\\right\\ } .\\ ] ] because we are using here the harmonic oscillator , the mathematical form of the above momentum - energy wave function is identical to that of the space - time wave function of eq.([eta ] ) .",
    "the lorentz squeeze properties of these wave functions are also the same .",
    "this aspect of the squeeze has been exhaustively discussed in the literature  @xcite , and they are illustrated again in fig .",
    "[ parton ] of the present pape .",
    "the hadronic structure function calculated from this formalism is in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "when the hadron is at rest with @xmath20 , both wave functions behave like those for the static bound state of quarks . as @xmath39 increases ,",
    "the wave functions become continuously squeezed until they become concentrated along their respective positive light - cone axes .",
    "let us look at the z - axis projection of the space - time wave function .",
    "indeed , the width of the quark distribution increases as the hadronic speed approaches that of the speed of light .",
    "the position of each quark appears widespread to the observer in the laboratory frame , and the quarks appear like free particles .",
    "the momentum - energy wave function is just like the space - time wave function .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution becomes wide - spread as the hadronic speed approaches the velocity of light .",
    "this is in contradiction with our expectation from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics that the width of the momentum distribution is inversely proportional to that of the position wave function .",
    "our expectation is that if the quarks are free , they must have their sharply defined momenta , not a wide - spread distribution .",
    "however , according to our lorentz - squeezed space - time and momentum - energy wave functions , the space - time width and the momentum - energy width increase in the same direction as the hadron is boosted .",
    "this is of course an effect of lorentz covariance .",
    "this indeed is to the resolution of one of the the quark - parton puzzles  @xcite .",
    "another puzzling problem in the parton picture is that partons appear as incoherent particles , while quarks are coherent when the hadron is at rest .",
    "does this mean that the coherence is destroyed by the lorentz boost ?",
    "the answer is no , and here is the resolution to this puzzle .",
    "when the hadron is boosted , the hadronic matter becomes squeezed and becomes concentrated in the elliptic region along the positive light - cone axis .",
    "the length of the major axis becomes expanded by @xmath90 , and the minor axis is contracted by @xmath90 .",
    "this means that the interaction time of the quarks among themselves become dilated . because the wave function becomes wide - spread , the distance between one end of the harmonic oscillator well and the other end increases .",
    "this effect , first noted by feynman  @xcite , is universally observed in high - energy hadronic experiments .",
    "the period of oscillation is increases like @xmath90 .",
    "on the other hand , the external signal , since it is moving in the direction opposite to the direction of the hadron travels along the negative light - cone axis , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tdil ] .    if the hadron contracts along the negative light - cone axis , the interaction time decreases by @xmath91 .",
    "the ratio of the interaction time to the oscillator period becomes @xmath92 .",
    "the energy of each proton coming out of the fermilab accelerator is @xmath93 .",
    "this leads the ratio to @xmath94 .",
    "this is indeed a small number .",
    "the external signal is not able to sense the interaction of the quarks among themselves inside the hadron .",
    "indeed , feynman s parton picture is one concrete physical example where the decoherence effect is observed . as for the entropy",
    ", the time - separation variable belongs to the rest of the universe . because we are not able to observe this variable , the entropy increases as the hadron is boosted to exhibit the parton effect .",
    "the decoherence is thus accompanied by an entropy increase .",
    "let us go back to the coupled - oscillator system .",
    "the light - cone variables in eq.([eta ] ) correspond to the normal coordinates in the coupled - oscillator system given in eq.([normal ] ) . according to feynman s parton picture ,",
    "the decoherence mechanism is determined by the ratio of widths of the wave function along the two normal coordinates .",
    "this decoherence mechanism observed in feynman s parton picture is quite different from other dicoherences discussed in the literature .",
    "it is widely understood that the word decoherence is the loss of coherence within a system . on the other hand ,",
    "feynman s decoherence discussed in this section comes from the way external signal interacts with the internal constituents .",
    "in this paper , we noted first that two - mode squeezed states can play a major role in clarifying some of the entanglement ideas .",
    "since the mathematical language of two - mode states is that of two coupled oscillators , the oscillator system can be a reservoir of physical ideas associated with entanglements .",
    "then , other physical models derivable from the coupled oscillators can carry the physics of entanglement .",
    "we have shown in this paper , the covariant harmonic oscillator system with one space and one time variable share the same mathematical framework as the coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "thus , the oscillator system gives a concrete example of space - time entanglement .",
    "thanks to its lorentz covariance , the covariant oscillator system can explain the quark model and parton model as two limiting cases of the same covariant entity .",
    "it can explain the peculiarities observed in feynman s parton picture .",
    "the most controversial aspect in the parton model is that , while the quarks interact coherently with external signals , partons behave like free particles interacting without coherence with external signals .",
    "this phenomenon was observed first by feynman .",
    "thus , it is quite appropriate to call this feynman s decoherence . in this paper , we have provided a resolution to this parton puzzle .",
    "it requires a space - time picture of entanglement .",
    "we would like to thank g. s. agarwal , h. hammer , and a. vourdas for helpful discussion on the precise definition of the word `` entanglement '' applicable to coupled systems .",
    "the basic difficulty with using plane waves for bound - state problems had been noted earlier in connection with the the calculation of the neutron - proton mass difference by dashen and frautschi .",
