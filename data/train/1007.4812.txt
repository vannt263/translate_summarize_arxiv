    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite , has emerged as the most promising candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has been attractive for its explanations towards several phenomena such as  ( i ) the higgs mass hierarchy problem in the sm , ( ii )  electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking via radiative corrections and ( iii )  the unification of the sm gauge couplings at the grand unification scale ( @xmath2  gev ) .",
    "assuming r - parity conservation , a specially attractive feature of the mssm is the presence of the stable , weakly interacting lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the form of lightest neutralino ( @xmath3 ) @xcite which turns out to be a good candidate for the observed cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe .",
    "however , the mssm has a large number of soft breaking parameters , which make it less predictive in its most general forms .",
    "most of these parameters can be elliminated by considering a definite susy breaking framework at the high scale . the simplest model in this regard , which assumes gravity as the mediator for susy breaking - the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite model - has only five free parameters .",
    "these are the common gaugino and scalar mass parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the common tri - linear coupling parameter @xmath6 , all given at the gauge coupling unification scale , the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values at the electroweak scale , namely @xmath7 , and the sign of the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the lightest neutralino can be expressed in terms of its gauge eigenstates , the bino , the wino and the two higgsinos as n_11 b + n_12 w+n_13 h_d+ n_14 h_u .",
    "[ lspcompositioneqn ] the model is primarily associated with a bino - dominated lsp that leads to over - abundance of dark matter .",

    "this simple model is highly predictive because of its small number of unknown parameters .",
    "however , a very severe restriction appears on the @xmath16 plane of msugra from the lep2 bound on lightest higgs boson mass ( @xmath17 ) @xcite , which reads m_h > 114.4  gev .",
    "[ higgs ]    in order to satisfy the limit @xmath18114 gev within the framework of msugra , one requires reasonably large values for the top squark mass ( @xmath19 ) which implies some fine - tuning of susy parameters to obtain the correct value of @xmath20 .",
    "however , the limit of eq . is related to the principle higgs search channel in the lep2 that involves production of the higgs boson via the @xmath21 process , followed by decays of the higgs boson .",
    "the production process principally depends on the coupling @xmath22 .",
    "now , in the mssm , the coupling @xmath22 is not identical with the respective coupling in the sm , it can rather be written as @xmath23(for reviews see @xcite ) . here",
    ", @xmath24 represents the sm higgs coupling to the @xmath25 boson .",
    "the prefactor @xmath26 appears due to the mixing of the cp - even higgs bosons , where @xmath27 is the mixing angle . in supersymmetric theories the limit of eq .",
    "refers to the scenarios where @xmath28 .",
    "this corresponds to the so - called _ decoupling _ zone for the higgs boson where one finds @xmath29 .",
    "in fact this is true for most of the parameter points in msugra .",
    "however , in the general mssm the above prefactor may become much smaller .",
    "this opens up a supersymmetric parameter space associated with a higgs mass smaller than the limit of eq .",
    "( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "this is the _ non decoupling",
    "_ zone for the higgs boson , where all higgs masses may have comparable values @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "an important virtue is that with this new window , a light higgs mass with @xmath31 gev could explain the slight excess of events of @xmath32 statistical significance @xcite as reported by the lep2 experiments @xcite . within this",
    "_ non decoupling _ zone it is possible to have a higgs boson lighter than the @xmath25 boson @xcite . in this regime",
    ", the higgs mass does not require large radiative corrections , thus could evade the little hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "this particular region , which has recently been named as _light higgs boson_ scenario or lhs @xcite , is also interesting as it provides definite predictions .",
    "since all higgs states are light enough , they can be produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this region can also accommodate the wmap data for the dark matter relic density @xcite . however , realization of the _ light higgs boson _",
    "scenario is not possible in the most constrained model like msugra .",
    "scenarios like supergravity - inspired nonuniversal higgs mass models ( nuhm ) , where the higgs mass square parameters may have different values at the scale @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) from the other scalars @xcite , may be useful in this regard .",
    "similarly , this particular susy zone can be realized in a particular nonuniversal scalar mass model where third generation squarks and the two higgs doublets may have vanishing values at the gut scale @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "adapting a nuhm framework , we try to explore this particular parameter space in the light of recent dark matter detection experiments",
    ". moreover , our focus will be to compute the indirect detection rate , particularly where the mass of the lightest neutralino and higgs bosons are reasonably small .",
    "we will try to find out the parameter space where the wmap data is satisfied via the resonant annihilation into a cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "this is interesting as then neutralino pair annihilations in our galaxy could produce detectable signals both in the antiproton and the gamma - ray channels .",
    "in fact , the part of the mssm parameter space with light neutralino masses which is otherwise forbidden in models like msugra , can completely be explored in the near future .",
    "the other wmap - satisfying zones , as mentioned , can not produce such large anti - proton / gamma ray signals ( except the fp / hb zone where the bino dominated lsp with sufficient higgsino component could lead to large signals ) . defining a measure for these observables",
    ", we examine the detection prospects for the parameter space in the ongoing as well as upcoming experiments .",
    "now , it is not surprising that the neutralino - nucleus spin - independent scattering cross - section @xmath35 , which is dominated by @xmath36-channel higgs exchange ( @xmath37 ) could be very large in the present context .",
    "the cross - section reaches its maximum value in the _ non decoupling _ zone because of smaller mass values of the cp - even higgs bosons .",
    "in fact this particular region may fall within the range of the exclusion limits as given by cdms - ii @xcite or xenon100 @xcite .",
    "however there exist considerable uncertainties in the computation of the above cross - section as well as the relevant experimental limits .",
    "the principle sources are related to ( i ) nuclear form factors , ( ii ) the wimp - nucleon scattering cross - section ( mainly concerning the strange quark content of the nucleon ) , ( iii ) the local dark matter density and ( iv ) the escape velocity of the wimp .",
    "considering all these uncertainties and particularly exploiting the uncertainty related to the strange quark content of the nucleon we will see that the predicted neutralino - nucleus scattering cross - section @xmath35 may change significantly .",
    "these uncertainties render the question of exclusion of interesting regions of the parameter space related to dark matter phenomenology subtle to answer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we will primarily discuss the model and the low energy constraints which are relevant here . in sec.[dir_detection",
    "] we introduce the spin - independent neutralino - nucleus scattering cross - section for the lsp .",
    "similarly , sec.[ind_detection ] is devoted to the indirect detection of the lsp , primarily to the ( i ) gamma - ray and the ( ii ) anti - proton signal .",
    "we describe our results in sec.[resultsall ] . in sec.[sec : directdetection ] we provide estimates regarding the effect of the uncertainties in the computation of @xmath35 .",
    "finally we conclude in sec.[sec : con ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the model parameters and the relevant low energy constraints . as mentioned in the introduction , we place ourselves in a supergravity framework with nonuniversal higgs masses at the gut scale .",
    "thus , the model can be specified by the following parameters : , a_0,m_0,,,sign ( ) , . here ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath6 represent universal values for the gaugino masses and the trilinear coupling parameters , while @xmath5 denotes universal masses for all scalars except the higgs bosons at the gut scale . in general",
    ", higgs scalars can belong to different multiplets of a grand unified gauge group , thus may assume different values than the other scalars in the theory ( see @xcite for motivated constructions leading to specific nonuniversal higgs mass terms ) . in this spirit , we scan over the higgs mass square parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 at the scale @xmath33 to produce a mssm parameter space consistent with all low energy constraints and where higgs bosons can be reasonably lighter .",
    "using the renormalization group equations ( rge ) for the soft susy breaking parameters along with the conditions for radiative ewsb one can determine @xmath8 and @xmath41 through ^2 = - m^2_z + + [ rewsbmusqeqn ] and 2= 2b/(m_h_d^2+m_h_u^2 + 2 ^ 2+_1+_2 ) [ rewsbbeqn ] where the @xmath42 s represent the one - loop corrections   @xcite , which become small at the scale where the higgs potential @xmath43 is minimized .",
    "we can approximate @xmath44 ( for @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 at tree level .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and the sparticle spectrum have been computed with suspect @xcite .",
    "we consider the following collider constraints in addition to the bounds on sparticle masses @xcite :    * * higgs boson mass limit : * in the _ non decoupling _ region where the @xmath0 boson becomes very light so that one has @xmath47 , the lower limit of @xmath17 goes down to 93 gev or even lower .",
    "we consider that the parameter space with @xmath48 ( or , @xmath49 ) , but with higgs mass @xmath50 is in agreement with the lep2 limit @xcite . in practice ,",
    "relaxing the constraint marginally we discern this zone with a value @xmath51 .",
    "consequently , the coupling of the heavier higgs boson to the @xmath25 boson ( @xmath52 ) becomes dominant and this makes the heavier higgs boson sm - like ( @xmath53 ) with the same lower bound as in eq.([higgs ] ) . in summary , to obtain acceptable susy spectra with @xmath50 , in addition to the desired value for @xmath54 , one also requires @xmath55gev .",
    "+ on the other hand , in the decoupling region ( @xmath56 ) , the limit of eq.([higgs ] ) needs to be respected .",
    "however we note that there is an uncertainty of about 3  gev in computing the mass of the light higgs boson @xcite .",
    "this theoretical uncertainty primarily originates from momentum - independent as well as momentum - dependent two - loop corrections and higher loop corrections from the top - stop sector .",
    "consequently , a lower limit of @xmath57  gev is often accepted for the susy light higgs boson mass . * * @xmath58 constraint : * the most significant contributions to @xmath59 originate from charged higgs and chargino exchange diagrams in models like msugra .",
    "the charged higgs ( @xmath60-@xmath36 loop ) contribution has the same sign and comparable strength with respect to the @xmath61-@xmath36 loop contribution of the sm , which already saturates the experimental result .",
    "hence , in scenarios where the charged higgs mass can be very small , satisfying the @xmath62 constraint requires a cancellation between the charged higgs and the chargino exchange diagrams .",
    "we will choose @xmath6 such that most of the parameter points , especially wmap - compliant ones , can satisfy this constraint .",
    "the effect of this constraint in the _ light higgs boson _",

    "the current experimental limit for @xmath68 coming from cdf @xcite can be written as ( at @xmath69 ) @xmath70 which has recently been improved to @xmath71 at @xmath72 c.l @xcite .",
    "the estimate of @xmath73 in the mssm depends strongly on the mass of a - boson and on the value of @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , the neutral higgs boson contribution scales as @xmath75 whereas there is a @xmath76 type of dependence .",

    "clearly , uncertainty in the computation of @xmath108 can produce significant shift to the strange quark parameter @xmath102 and consequently to the measured spin - independent cross - section .",

    "the scalar cross - section depends on t - channel higgs exchange ( @xmath37 ) and s - channel squark exchange diagrams ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "now , considering the strong bounds on the light squark masses , @xmath35 is dominated by the exchange of cp - even higgs bosons . in the present context , where both cp - even higgs masses are quite small",

    "in fact , we shall see that in the mass range @xmath50 , the spin - independent cross - section becomes maximal and this renders the _ light higgs boson _",

    "the latter contributions in the context of down - type fermions include @xmath119 as @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    ". clearly , both couplings may become quite large for larger values of @xmath119 .",
    "these large couplings , in addition to the small mass values for @xmath122 , make this _ light higgs boson _ zone almost ruled out for larger values of @xmath119 .",
    "indirect detection techniques are based on the detection of primary or secondary particles resulting from dark matter ( dm ) annihilation or decay .",
    "the observed flux of these particles is proportional to the annihilation rate of the dm species which in turn is , for the annihilating case , proportional to @xmath123 , the dark matter density profile . in the following , we summarize the basic ingredients of the formalism that we shall be employing in this work .        the differential flux of gamma  rays generated from dark matter annihilations and coming from a direction forming an angle @xmath124 with respect to the galactic center ( gc ) is @xmath125 where @xmath126 if the annihilating particle is majorana - like or dirac - like respectively , @xmath127 is the total self annihilation cross - section averaged over velocity for @xmath128 , @xmath129 is the mass of any dm particle , @xmath130 is the differential spectrum of final state @xmath131 into gamma - rays of energy @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the dark matter density profile .",
    "we note that in this work we only focus on prompt photons , ignoring potential contributions from synchrotron emission or inverse compton scattering of charged particles with the interstellar medium .    the functions @xmath134 have been computed using the fragmentation of standard model particles into @xmath135-rays according to the pythia @xcite monte carlo code .",
    "now , of course , we do nt observe annihilations along a line but rather within a conical region around some angle @xmath136 .",
    "it is convenient to define the dimensionless quantity @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the sun s distance from the galactic center and @xmath139 the local dm density ( actually , they can be any arbitrary normalization factors rendering @xmath140 a dimensionless quantity ) .",
    "+ then , we can define the average of this quantity within a solid angle @xmath141 as @xmath142 and we can then rewrite the flux as @xmath143    the most common region of the sky that is examined in the literature as a source of @xmath135-rays is the galactic center , since it is the region where @xmath144-body simulations predict a maximization of the dark matter density distribution and , hence , the corresponding gamma - ray flux . however , the galactic center is a region which is known poorly : there are large uncertainties in the background modelizations as well as the density profile itsself .    as an alternative ,",
    "it has been proposed ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that one could maximize the signal / background ratio by actually excluding the region around the galactic center . following this reference",
    ", we perform our computations in a conoidal region extending from @xmath145 up to @xmath146 from the galactic center , excluding at the same time the regions within @xmath147 from the galactic plane .",

    "the relevant background for this region will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "it should also be noted that other regions of the sky might provide very interesting results , as shown for example in @xcite .    in the meantime , we present in table [ jbars ] the values obtained for the @xmath148 quantity defined in eq.([jbar ] ) , for three different halo profiles often discussed in the literature : the navarro , frenck and white one ( nfw ) @xcite , which seems to be favoured by the recent results of the via lactea ii simulation @xcite , the einasto profile which is favoured by the findings of the acquarius project collaboration @xcite and a nfw - like profile that has tried to take into account the effects of baryons in the inner galactic regions , causing an adiabatic collapse of dm in this area and a significant enhancement of its central density @xcite .",

    "this zone , however , is highly constrained in the msugra model if one respects the flavor physics constraints @xcite .",
    "the spin - independent cross - sections @xcite , on the other hand , could be compatible with the cdms - ii @xcite limits .",

    "we recall that the higgsino components of the lsp are essentially determined by the @xmath8 parameter . for a relatively large @xmath8 ( 500  gev@xmath184750 gev , fig.[a01100 ] ) ,",

    "interestingly , even this wmap - satisfying zone does not require large values of gaugino masses .",
    "we will observe that this whole region can lead to large gamma - ray as well as antiproton signals in present or oncoming experiments .    before presenting our results on indirect detection",
    ", we would like to point out the results of the flavor physics observables like @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "since we have chosen a rather moderate value for @xmath119 ( @xmath190 ) , the @xmath189 constraint is not quite stringent for the parameter space shown in fig.[a01100 ] . on the other hand @xmath191 constitutes a strong constraint particularly in the _ non - decoupling _ region where charged higgs bosons can be very light .",
    "however , with large negative @xmath6 values ( negative values for @xmath192 at the electro - weak scale ) , one of the stop eigenstates becomes lighter due to large mixing and this provides a cancellation between charged higgs and chargino induced diagrams .",

    "we should note here that a light higgs with mass @xmath200gev may be allowed , but then @xmath54 needs to be further suppressed .",
    "this region is then further constrained and we did not consider it in our analysis .    as discussed , with the choice of parameters of fig.[a01100 ] , the _ light higgs boson _",
    "region is confined only up to @xmath201gev .",
    "since the flavor constraint @xmath62 is particularly prohibitive , one needs to tune the @xmath6 to obtain a wmap satisfied region compatible with the constraints from flavor physics . in principle",
    ", one could scan over the 4d parameter space namely @xmath202 to search for the complete @xmath203 range in the _ light higgs boson _ region .",
    "however , rather than attempting a full , but very cpu - consuming scan over this entire parameter space , we choose to restrict ourselves to the subregions of the mssm parameter space where the lightest neutralino can be light or relatively heavier .    passing to fig.[a01000 ] ,",
    "we now explore part of the mssm parameter space where pair annihilation of relatively heavier neutralinos in the _ light higgs boson _ zone can conform the wmap data via @xmath0 exchange .",
    "we will see that the @xmath135/@xmath204 signals for this subset of the mssm parameter space , in addition to the previous results , can be very illustrative to draw some general conclusions for the @xmath0 annihilation region , particularly in the context of the _ light higgs boson _ zone .",
    "this could be attributed to the fact that the @xmath0-funnel region is characterized by large pair annihilation cross - sections ( insensitive to the velocity of lsp ) .",
    "now , for simplicity we fix @xmath5 at the very similar value @xmath164gev , while @xmath205gev is chosen to make @xmath62 less restrictive . here",
    ", we set @xmath39 ( @xmath206 ) and varied @xmath40 ( @xmath207 ) with @xmath38 to obtain the wmap - compatible regions for neutralinos .",
    "our scan renders very small @xmath8 values ( @xmath208 ) , consequently the lsp can have large higgsino components . with the choice of the input parameters that we assumed in this case , we find that the @xmath209gev region is not quite compatible with the chargino mass limit",
    ".    we can see from fig.[a01000 ] that @xmath210gev corresponds to the _ non - decoupling _",
    "zone for the higgs boson .",
    "clearly , the lightest neutralino ( @xmath211gev ) is quite far from the resonance annihilation condition i.e. , @xmath212 , thus the pair annihilation process actually occurs via off - shell @xmath0 boson exchange ( large higgsino component enhances the neutralino coupling to the higgs boson ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath25 bosons in the @xmath213-channel and particularly , neutralinos in the @xmath36 channel could also contribute significantly in the annihilation precesses .",
    "thus , compared to the previous case , where the @xmath214 final state has the maximum branching ratio , here several other final states involving the higgs bosons ( @xmath215 ) open up .",
    "we should note that @xmath203 can not be much larger as then the neutralino would be further away from the resonance condition , which in turn makes the pair annihilation via @xmath0-boson exchange less significant . similarly , one requires large higgsino components or small @xmath8 parameter to satisfy the wmap data , which is not favoured in the light of recent results of the spin - independent neutralino - nucleon cross - section .",
    "alike the previous case , here the wmap satisfying zone is compatible with the @xmath62 constraint .      before presenting our results for indirect detection",
    ", we should define the measure , in particular what we mean by `` exclusion '' and `` detectability '' . in order to assess whether a parameter space point is excluded by current data from fermi or pamela , we should have some estimate of the background spectra for both gamma - rays and antiprotons . till the present day , and despite the remarkable efforts devoted to the subject ,",
    "no such generally accepted estimate exists . however , and quite generically , we expect the background to be of a power law form @xmath216 in both channels .    now , every flux measurement contains both background as well as ( hopefully ) signal events . for every parameter space point",
    ", we can compute the gamma - ray or antiproton fluxes as described previously .",
    "then , each point shall be considered as excluded if there is no @xmath217 combination ( i.e. the generic power - law background ) for which the sum of the signal and the background can provide a good fit to the data .",
    "hence , we vary @xmath217 , compute the corresponding backgrounds and then subsequently add the signal contribution to check if there exists some background form for which this sum provides a sufficiently good fit to the data . if no such @xmath217 can be found , the corresponding parameter space point can be considered as excluded . in practice , the criterion we demand is that the sum of the signal and the background should fall within the @xmath72 cl error bars as given by the fermi or pamela collaborations .",
    "the method we follow in order to characterize a parameter space point as being detectable has the same philosophy : first , we need some estimate of what future data could look like . to satisfy the criterion",
    ", we adopt a power law background that is compatible with current measurements . in order to minimize the signal s significance",
    ", we choose this background at the upper @xmath218 cl error bar of the fermi or pamela experimental points .",
    "then , for each parameter space point , we add the signal to this background , creating a set of pseudo - data that could appear in the future .",
    "as pointed out , the exact form of the background is in general unknown , but its general form is expected to be a power - law , we could look for deviations of the pseudo - data from such a behaviour .",
    "if it is impossible to find a power law form that fits this pseudo - data well enough , then the corresponding parameter space point is characterized as detectable . if such an @xmath217 combination can be found , then the signal shall be indistinguishable from the background ( unless some other measurements allow to constrain the viable @xmath217 combination , a possibility that we do not consider here ) .",
    "the goodness - of - fit criterion , what we choose is based on the @xmath219 quantity , which is defined as @xmath220 where nbins is the number of bins , taken to be @xmath157 in both cases , @xmath221 is the pseudo - data , whereas @xmath222 is the background - only number of events that we try to fit to the pseudo - data .",
    "if the best fitting power - law has a @xmath219 larger than @xmath223 ( our problem has @xmath224 degrees of freedom , since we are trying to fit @xmath225 variables",
    "@xmath217 ) , this means that there is no ( background - only ) power - law that can fit the pseudo - data .",
    "hence , if @xmath226 the corresponding parameter space point is detectable , since the signal it generates is distinguishable from the background .",
    "if we wish to sum up our method in `` hypothesis testing '' terms , we could say that in the case of exclusion we are testing a null hypothesis according to which existing data can be well - described by dark matter annihilations plus some background form . in the detectability case ,",
    "the null hypothesis is that the pseudo - data ( containing both signal and background ) can be well fitted by a background only function .",
    "[ results ]     +     +      our analysis shows that the current fermi and pamela data do not impose any constraints on the parameter space , at least as far as the wmap - compliant regions are concerned .",
    "from now on , we shall therefore stick to predictions concerning the detection perspectives as described in the previous paragraph .",
    "in fig.[a01100 ] , with the choice of parameters described earlier , we also plot the contours where the @xmath219 between the background - only fit and the pseudo - data becomes equal to @xmath223 , a case in which the background - only hypothesis can be rejected at @xmath72 cl and the corresponding parameter space points are thus detectable for the case @xmath227gev .",
    "the wmap compatible region within the contours @xmath228 or @xmath229 has @xmath230 and is , thus , detectable .",
    "we assume the einasto profile and the max propagation model for gamma - rays and antiprotons respectively .",
    "the contours for gamma - rays are blue - dashed whereas for antiprotons violet - dotted - dashed .",
    "all parameter space points lying among the two lines which are quasi - symmetric around the resonnance are detectable according to our previous definitions .",
    "we note that in the case of gamma - rays , switching to another profile does not significantly alter the results . in the case of antiprotons",
    "however , the results _ do _ change . for the sake of clarity we omit plotting these results , but we have calculated that both for the min and the med propagation model defined previously and we find that some parts of the parameter space evade detection .",
    "we note that the points that satisfy wmap through resonnant @xmath213 - channel exchange of @xmath14 persistently evade detection , a point on which we shall further comment in the following paragraphs .    before explaining these results , we notice in @xcite that , the fermi satelite should in principle be able to exclude wimps with thermal cross - sections lying in our neutralino mass range and for @xmath231 final states .",
    "furthermore , these estimates were extracted having in mind the galactic center as observation region . as mentioned , looking _ around",
    "_ this region can further improve the observation perspectives .",
    "concerning our results , it is interesting that practically all the points offer quite good detection perspectives .",
    "this is mainly related to the fact that the present values of the annihilation cross - sections for the parameter space points satisfying the wmap constraints are quite high , namely of the same order as during the time of decoupling ( i.e. , in the thermal region ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the mechanism through which the correct relic density is actually obtained .",
    "we already pointed out that in this scenario the mechanism that drives neutralino annihilation is resonnant @xmath213-channel pseudoscalar higgs boson exhange , apart from the small region at low @xmath4 and relatively large @xmath41 , where the dominant mechanism is cp - even light higgs exchange . in the case of annihilation through an @xmath0 propagator , the cross - section is practically insensitive to velocity changes as pointed out for example in @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the self - annihilation cross - section stays quite high even at present times .",
    "it is really instructive to compare this regime with the corresponding points where the acceptable relic density is produced via neutralino pair annihilation into @xmath14 boson . in this case",
    ", @xmath232 tends to zero as the lsp velocity does so ( i.e. , at present times , which is relevant for indirect detection experiments ) .",
    "this is indeed an interesting effect , which renders the @xmath14-pole points practically invisible to indirect detection experiments .",
    "the same has been pointed out , for example , in @xcite , where detectability limits ( although defined differently ) seem to systematically `` avoid '' the @xmath14-pole region .",
    "now , we should note that the decay modes in the funnel region are dominated by the @xmath231 final states .",
    "this is due to the fact that neutralino pair annihilation into @xmath0 and then into down type fermions is proportional to @xmath119 along with the quark masses .",
    "it is well - known that the ( @xmath214 ) final state yielding relatively rich photon spectra if compared , for example , to the leptonic case .",
    "on the other hand for the antiproton yield , the decays of light quarks have the tendency of producing more antiprotons than @xmath231 pairs .",
    "let us proceed to our second scenario , i.e. , fig.[a01000 ] .",
    "once again , the blue - dashed line depicts region where @xmath233 for gamma - rays whereas the violet - dotted - dashed line represents the same condition for antiprotons .",
    "astrophysical assumptions are the same as in the previous case .",
    "points lying above , below or on the left of the contours are detectable .",
    "if we plotted the gamma - ray results for the other two profiles we examined , results would be practically unchanged . in the case of the two other propagation models for antiprotons , ams-02 will be blind to the part of the relic density satisfying points .",
    "we can see that in this scenario , the perspectives are also quite good .",
    "we should note that we are still lying in the @xmath0-pole region ( with significant contribution from @xmath234channel @xmath25 and @xmath235channel neutralino exchange ) : the neutralino annihilation is driven by the @xmath213-channel pseudoscalar exchange .",
    "once again , @xmath232 lies roughly in the typical thermal region .",
    "but in this case , the lightest neutralino has a higher mass than previously .",
    "this is the reason why for relatively large values of @xmath4 , we have a certain deterioration in the detection perspectives , particularly in the lower branch of the wmap compliant parameter space .",
    "this is mostly visible in the antiproton channel , where we see that practically all lhs points are invisible at ams-02 .",
    "we have checked that if we consider more stringent gamma - ray detectability criterion , the same tendency would be visible for the corresponding contour as well .",
    "this behaviour could be connected to the fact that in this particular parameter space ( lower branch ) , higgs and gauge bosons have significant branching fraction in the final state .",
    "this is not the case for the upper branch , where the dominant channel is @xmath214 .",
    "the main effect of a final state including higgses is to shift the energy spectrum towards lower energies ( since we consider the higgs bosons to decay predominantly into @xmath236 pairs ) , where the background is larger .",
    "it is thus more difficult to disentagle the non - power law component of the spectrum ( i.e. the signal ) from the background .    in the two scenarios we examine two regimes , one with a quite light neutralino ( @xmath237 gev ) and one with a relatively heavier one ( @xmath238 gev ) , finding that a good part of our parameter space should be visible at fermi and ams-02 .",
    "there is , however , one question that could be asked , namely what happens in the intermediate mass regime , particularly in the context of _ light higgs boson _ zone .",
    "the answer could be given once more by considering that it is well - known that increasing the wimp mass tends to aggravate detection perspectives , if the same final states and self - annihilation cross - section are assumed .",
    "both the @xmath239 s and @xmath127 remain quite stable in value from lighter to higher masses in our model : the final state is mostly @xmath231 ( in the second case higgs final states are also significant which subsequently decays mostly into @xmath214 ) and the cross - section is of the typical thermal value , both during decoupling _ and _ at present times .",
    "thus , it is easy to infer that the intermediate mass regime would also be able to produce rich @xmath240ray or anti - proton signals .",
    "overall , this @xmath0-pole scenario that we have examined can be considered as quite promising for indirect detection .",
    "we shall further comment on that in the conclusions section .",
    "in fig.[directlimits ] we depict the wmap - compliant parameter points on the @xmath241 ( neutralino mass - neutralino - nucleon spin - independent scattering cross - section ) plane and compare them against the three strongest bounds available in the literature : the combined 2008 and 2009 cdms - ii @xcite results , the constraints from the xenon10 experiment as well as the latest bounds from xenon100 .",
    "we take the two former ones from ref . @xcite and the latter from @xcite .",
    "we further highlight the points falling into the light higgs scenario defined throughout this paper with different colors .",
    "we indeed see that many of our points fall largely within the region that is supposed to be excluded from the existing data . whereas the @xmath227gev scenario ( pink points ) is more or less satisfying the constraints , the scenario with @xmath242gev ( yellow points ) is in most cases largely above the limits , exceeding by more than an order of magnitude compared to the cdms - ii and xenon100 allowed cross - sections .",
    "the large values for @xmath243 in the latter case can be attributed to the large higgsino components of the neutralino which enhance the coupling @xmath244 . in both cases ,",
    "the points belonging to the _ light higgs boson _",
    "region fall within the excluded zones .",
    "however , it has been repeatedly pointed out in the literature that there can be significant uncertainties that complicate the assertion on whether a particular model is excluded or not @xcite . more specifically :    * uncertainties can arise in the calculation of the neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering cross - section , which can be due to a number of factors .",
    "for example , as described in detail in @xcite , significant uncertainties can arise in the passage from the parton - level cross - section to the hadronic level one .",
    "* some uncertainties might be present in the passage from the hadronic to the nuclear level .",
    "indeed , at the end of the day the primarily constrained quantity is the wimp-_nucleus _ elastic scattering cross - section and not the wimp-_nucleon _ one . *",
    "the local dark matter density is by no means a perfectly well known quantity and is in fact a normalization factor in the overall procedure of computing the wimp - nucleus scattering rate .",
    "this uncertainty also enters in the indirect detection calculation , in fact in a more severe way since the gamma - ray or antiproton fluxes depend quadratically on the aforementioned quantity . *",
    "little is known on the true velocity distribution of the wimps in the detector rest frame as well as on the escape velocity at which the integral over the velocity distribution should be truncated .",
    "the first point concerns our calculation of the spin - independent neutralino - nucleon elastic scattering cross - section . in other words , and refering to fig.[directlimits ] , we expect that a certain variation in the position of parameter space points on the @xmath241 plane should be allowed .",
    "the other remarks apply to the experimental limits published from the various collaborations , i.e. , they can amount to a change in the position of the exclusion lines .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a systematic study of the hadronic uncertainties entering the neutralino - nucleon scattering cross - section is performed .",
    "it turns out that the most striking and influential uncertainty comes from the pion - nucleon @xmath108 term which is poorly known but an essential ingredient for a precise calculation of the relevant cross - section .",
    "this source of uncertainty alone can give rise to a variation in the spin - independent cross - section of more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this means that the relevant neutralino - nucleon scattering cross - sections that we have calculated can in fact vary by a factor of more than @xmath155 . as mentioned in sec.[dir_detection ] , uncertainty in @xmath108 may decrease the coefficient @xmath102 and this is in fact predicted by recent lattice simulation .",
    "thus , we study the variation in @xmath243 with smaller @xmath102 values . following the discussion in sec.[dir_detection ] , here we consider two representative values for @xmath102 namely @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "we present our results in fig.[directlimitsfts ] .",
    "indeed , we can see that the neutralino - nucleon spin - independent cross - sections decrease by significant factors , reaching up to an order of magnitude ( particularly for @xmath247 ) .",
    "this clearly starts raising questions on whether a good portion of the parameter space is excluded ( as one would naively expect from fig.[directlimits ] ) or not .",
    "+    we see , however , that - especially in the heavier neutralino scenario - there are still some parameter points lying above the exclusion lines ( roughly by a factor of @xmath248 ) .",
    "this is particularly true for the lhs scenario .",
    "however , this conclusion may become weaker if one considers the other uncertainties which we describe below . passing to the nuclear level",
    "requires modelling of the nucleon density within the nucleus .",
    "the most commonly used parametrization is the one presented by engel in @xcite .",
    "now , the deviation that might arise from different form factor parametrizations has been performed , for example , in @xcite , where the authors find that the exclusion lines can shift vertically by roughly a factor of @xmath249 .",
    "next , we discuss the uncertainty related to the local dark matter density .",
    "most experimental analyses including the ones considered in the present work are performed assuming the so - called standard halo model . in this model , the local dm density is usually taken to have a fixed value of @xmath250 gev @xmath251 .",
    "typically , the uncertainties associated with the local density value are given to be of the order of @xmath252 at a @xmath218 confidence level , i.e. , less than a factor of two .",
    "it is , however , true that these estimates depend on specific astrophysical assumptions .",
    "there have been authors who using a wide range of possible halo profiles @xcite or no halo modelization at all @xcite find values for the local density ranging from @xmath253 up to roughly @xmath254 gev @xmath251 at @xmath218 cl .",
    "furthermore , clumpy behaviour could further disrupt these estimates , although @xmath144-body simulations seem to rather disfavour such a possibility @xcite .",
    "thus there may be a factor @xmath255 variation in the local dm density , which would rescale the corresponding wimp - nucleon scattering cross - section limits by the same amount .",
    "a recent treatment of the astrophysical uncertainties involved in direct dm detection is @xcite , while a summary of some of these uncertainties with several references can also be found in @xcite .",
    "varying the escape velocity can play an important role either for larger lsp masses which are irrelevant in our case or for models involving quite different processes than the ones involved in the mssm neutralino case @xcite .",
    "the same applies to the uncertainties arising from the experimental error in the determination of the sun s circular velocity around the galactic center , which assumes a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution for neutralinos .",
    "therefore we expect only a small modifications in the exclusion limits ( @xmath256 ) due to these aforementioned variations .",
    "we see that overall , and despite the apparent exclusion of a large portion of lhs points , there is still quite some margin for changing the relation among the predicted @xmath241 as derived from the model and the exclusion limits as presented by the corresponding collaborations .",
    "we feel it is reasonable to say that we can not assess that easily whether the parameter space points lying above the exclusion lines in fig.[directlimits ] are actually excluded or not .",
    "we should clarify at this point that the previous remarks have by no means the purpose of demeaning the remarkable works that are done both by theorists and experimentalists in order to develop tools for calculations and extract reliable bounds .",
    "our goal was just to illustrate that it might still be meaningful to examine models which at first sight appear to be excluded .",
    "this becomes particularly apparent from our calculation of the spin - independent cross - section for different values of @xmath102 .",
    "we have examined the dark matter - related phenomenology of a particular subset of the mssm parameter space adapting nonuniversal higgs masses at the gut scale . we confine ourselves to a particular regime where the mssm higgs scalars as well as neutralinos can be relatively light .",
    "our principal investigation is devoted where lightest cp - even higgs boson is below the lep2 limit , but still allowed due to the reduced value of @xmath25@xmath25@xmath14 coupling .",
    "the wmap limits on the dark matter relic density are satisfied by the neutralino self - annihilation through @xmath0 , @xmath14 or @xmath13 propagators . for illustration purposes",
    "we have chosen two specific examples with different neutralino masses .",
    "then we have examined the detectability of the scenarios in the current fermi - lat and the upcoming ams-02 experiment for the detection of gamma - rays and antiprotons respectively .",
    "we have found that overall the model offers quite promising detection prospects : the self - annihilation cross - section at zero velocity , relevant for indirect detection , is quite high , i.e. , of the same order of magnitude as needed in order to get the correct relic density for the wimps .",
    "this is especially the case when annihilation is driven by @xmath213-channel pseodoscalar exchange .",
    "furthermore , the final states being mostly comprised of @xmath231 pairs ( with significant higgs bosons final states for relatively larger neutralino masses ) , the resulting spectra are quite rich both in gamma - rays and antiprotons ( especially for photons ) . in this context",
    "we did not consider the possibility of substructure in the galactic halo , which could enhance the signal by roughly a factor of @xmath155 as is well - known in the literature .",
    "finally , we have computed the neutralino - nucleon spin - independent scattering cross - section and find that under the most common assumptions a significant part of the lhs region seems to be excluded by current direct detection measurements .",
    "we however showed that numerous uncertainties could severely influence this assessment .",
    "furthermore , the preceeding analysis demonstrates , once more , the value of a multi - messenger approach towards dark matter detection .",
    "firstly , each detection mode offers a distinct probe for dark matter signals which can be used to cross - check others .",
    "then , some regions of the parameter space might be undetectable in some channel , but visible in some other : this is the case of the lhs in our second benchmark , which is invisible in antiproton detection but visible in gamma - rays or direct detection .",
    "overall , different detection techniques can act in a highly complementary way .",
    "we would like to close this article with a remark that seems to have a more general validity than the model we examined in our case . as we said , the regions where the correct relic density can be obtained in the mssm are quite limited in their general characteristics",
    ". one of them is the so - called funnel region , where the self - annihilation cross - section is enhanced through resonnant @xmath213 - channel exchange of higgses , @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath0 . in the latter case ,",
    "it is known for quite some time that the cross - section does not depend strongly on the neutralino velocity .",
    "the fact that the large area telescopes being at least as powerful as fermi can probe self - annihilation cross - section values of the order of @xmath257 @xmath258 sec and masses of roughly up to @xmath259 gev has also been demonstrated .",
    "it can hence be seen that the @xmath0 - pole region for reasonable neutralino masses constitutes one of the most favoured regions for indirect detection in both the gamma - ray and the anti - proton channel . on the contrary , other wmap compatible regions namely the @xmath14-pole resonance annihilation region or the coannihilation regions ( where the higgsino component is tiny ) where the cross - section is much smaller at present times than during decoupling can not produce so large indirect detection rates .",
