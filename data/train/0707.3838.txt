    "the issue of ergodicity in condensed matter physics is well known since fifties @xcite . given two operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 , describing physical quantities ( e.g. , charge , spin , pair densities or currents ) , one can study the physical response of a system described by a certain hamiltonian @xmath2 through the generalized susceptibility @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an external field entering the hamiltonian of the system under study in a coupling term of the type @xmath5 and @xmath6 stands for the statistical average in some ensemble over the perturbed system .",
    "kubo @xcite immediately noticed that the static isolated susceptibility @xmath7 , defined for an isolated system perturbed by an external field turned on adiabatically , and the isothermal susceptibility @xmath8 , defined for a system in thermal equilibrium in presence of a time - independent external field , can be generally different .",
    "in particular , falk @xcite has shown that the static isolated susceptibility is just a lower bound for the isothermal one @xmath9 .",
    "we recall that the static isolated susceptibility @xmath7 , within the linear response theory , is defined through the related retarded green s function @xcite @xmath10\\right\\rangle_0\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath11 stands for the statistical average in the microcanonical ensemble ( i.e. , fixing energy ) on the unperturbed system and @xmath12 for the fourier transform .    on the other hand ,",
    "the isothermal susceptibility @xmath8 can be computed as @xmath13 in fact , starting from the expression of the thermal average in the canonical ensemble ( i.e. , fixing temperature ) @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we can expand @xmath18 in powers of @xmath4 and get @xmath19 substituting this expansion into ( [ average ] ) and retaining only the first order term in @xmath4 , we get at the numerator @xmath20 and at the denominator @xmath21 and by the ratio @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the partition function of the unperturbed system . taking the derivative after ( [ susceptibility ] ) and exploiting the cyclic property of the trace",
    ", we obtain the isothermal susceptibility as in ( [ isothermal ] ) .",
    "now , if we rewrite both expressions by means of the general formulas for the retarded green s functions and the correlation functions given in the companion article @xcite ( see section 3 ) , present in this same issue , we get @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xcite @xmath26 is proportional to the volume of the system , the sum over @xmath27 ranges over the number of fields in the chosen basis , @xmath28 are the spectral density functions , @xmath29 are the poles of the propagator , @xmath30 is an unknown function appearing in case of poles with zero value .",
    "we can immediately see that the two susceptibilities differ for the following expression @xmath31    now , one can check that rewriting the expression @xmath32 by means of the general formula for the correlation functions given in the companion article @xcite ( see section 3 ) , present in this same issue , we just get @xmath33 and , accordingly , the difference at the r.h.s . of ( [ diff ] ) is just what enters khintchin s theorem @xcite : a dynamics is ergodic ( i.e. , phase space equilibrium averages are equal to ensemble microcanical averages , which are much easier to compute ) @xmath34 if an only if @xmath35 in other words a dynamic is ergodic if correlations attenuate in time .",
    "in particular , for @xmath36 , the dynamics of @xmath0 is ergodic if , during its time evolution , it has non - zero matrix elements only between states within a zero - volume region of the phase space of the system @xcite .",
    "it is clear now the link between ergodicity and response theory : the two definitions of susceptibility differ when the dynamics of the system is not ergodic .",
    "two little , but important , notices : finite systems are not ergodic by definition , just because of the inequivalence of the ensembles ; non - ergodicity at zero temperature is just the result of a degeneracy in the ground state .",
    "several years later it was shown @xcite that the difference between the two definitions of susceptibility is related to the zero - frequency anomaly exhibited by bosonic correlation functions : the presence of undetermined constants in the bosonic correlation functions .",
    "this is exactly what the relations derived above and the results of the companion article @xcite predict establishing a definite link between the ergodicity of the dynamics and the green s function formalism .",
    "it was first put in evidence in @xcite and then studied by many other authors @xcite .",
    "there is a general believe that this problem is of academic interest and in the last years no much attention has been dedicated to it .",
    "the main reason is that the response functions , the experimentally observed quantities , are given by retarded bosonic green s function which formally do not depend on the such undetermined constants , which are , therefore , considered of no physical interest .",
    "the general attitude @xcite is to believe that in macroscopic real systems at equilibrium at a temperature @xmath37 , the fluctuations are very small and the interaction between the system and the reservoir would introduce an irreversible relaxation and decouple the correlation functions .",
    "then , as suggested in @xcite , these constants should be always determined by requiring the ergodicity .",
    "this procedure is some how an artifice and may lead to serious problems because it might break the internal self - consistency of the entire formulation .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , the zero - frequency anomaly is a manifestation of the difficulty in extracting irreversible behavior from the statistical mechanics .",
    "this is true , but as long as we use the scheme of statistical mechanics we must be careful in doing self - consistent calculations . breaking",
    "the self - consistency might bring to serious errors .    according to the well - known relations existing between casual ( @xmath38 ) , retarded ( @xmath39 ) green s functions and correlation functions @xmath40=\\re [ g^{c } ( { \\bf k } , \\omega ) ] \\\\ & \\im [ g^{r } ( { \\bf k } , \\omega)]= \\tanh \\left ( { { { \\beta \\omega } \\over 2 } } \\right)\\im [ g^{c } ( { \\bf k } , \\omega ) ] \\\\",
    "& c({\\bf k } , \\omega)=-\\left [ { 1+\\tanh \\left ( { { { \\beta \\omega } \\over 2 } } \\right ) } \\right]\\im [ g^{c } ( { \\bf k } , \\omega)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the zero - frequency excitations do not contribute explicitly to the imaginary part of the retarded green s functions and , consequently , @xmath41 does not explicitly appear in the expressions of susceptibilities . at any rate ,",
    "susceptibilities retain an implicit dependence on @xmath41 through the matrix elements .",
    "then , the right procedure to compute both correlation functions and susceptibilities is clearly the one that starts from the causal green s function , which is the only green s function that explicitly depends on @xmath41 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the value of @xmath41 dramatically affects the values of directly measurable quantities ( e.g. , compressibility , specific heat , magnetic susceptibility ,  ) through the values of correlation functions and susceptibilities . according to this ,",
    "whenever it is possible , @xmath41 should be exactly calculated case by case .",
    "if we do not have access to the complete set of eigenstates and eigenvalues of the system , which is the rule in the most interesting cases , we have to compute correlation functions and susceptibilities within some , often approximated , analytical framework .",
    "now , since no analytical tool can easily determine @xmath41 ( e.g. , the equations of motion can not be used to fix @xmath41 as it is constant in time ) , one usually assumes the ergodicity of the dynamics of @xmath42 and simply substitutes @xmath41 by its ergodic value ( i.e. , by the r.h.s . of ( [ erg_def ] ) ) : @xmath43 unfortunately , this procedure can not be justified a priori ( i.e. , without computing @xmath41 through its definition ( [ gammadef ] ) ) by absolutely no means .",
    "the existence of just one integral of motion and , more generally , of any operator that has a diagonal part with respect to the hamiltonian @xcite ( i.e. by any operator that has a diagonal entries whenever written in the basis of eigenstates of the hamiltonian ) divides the phase space into separate subspaces not connected by the dynamics .",
    "this latter , in turn , becomes non ergodic : time averages give different results with respect to ensemble averages .",
    "this latter consideration also clarifies why the ergodic nature of the dynamics of an operator mainly depends on the hamiltonian it is subject to .",
    "it is really remarkable that @xmath41 is directly related to relevant measurable quantities such as compressibility and specific heat trough the dissipation - fluctuation theorem .",
    "for instance , we recall the formula that relates the compressibility to the total particle number fluctuations @xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the total particle number operator , @xmath46 is its average and @xmath26 is proportional to the volume of the system .",
    "we see that a compressibility different from zero requires the non - ergodicity of the system with respect to total particle number operator .",
    "according to this , in the case of infinite systems too the correct determination of @xmath41 can not be considered as an irrelevant issue ( e.g. , ( [ eq1.36a ] ) holds in the thermodynamic limit too ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we provide some examples of violation of the ergodic condition ( [ erg_def ] ) .",
    "it is necessary pointing out , in order to avoid any possible confusion to the reader , that we are using _",
    "full _ operators and not _ fluctuation _ ones ( i.e. , we use operators not diminished of their average value , in contrast with what it is usually done for the bosonic excitations like spin , charge and pair ) . according to this ,",
    "the @xmath41 can be different from zero ( i.e. , be equal to the squared average of the operator ) , and still indicate an ergodic dynamics for the operator .",
    "the two - site hubbard model is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath47 where the summation range only over two sites at distance @xmath48 from each other and the rest of notation is standard @xcite .",
    "the hopping matrix @xmath49 is defined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "we now proceed to study the system by means of the equation of motion approach and the green s function formalism @xcite .",

    "the ground state in this phase has average total spin equal to one and , therefore , @xmath196 .",
    "we obviously conclude that ( e - ii ) phase is ergodic in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the _ weird _ phase ( w ) ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is characterized by a quite strong size dependence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) where a tentative finite - size scaling of @xmath41 in the different points of the phase is presented .",
    "this region manifests a diverging finite - size scaling within the range of sizes we were able to handle . in this case , the behavior of @xmath41 as a function of @xmath161 strongly depends on the particular choice of the hamiltonian couplings and is highly non monotonous when increasing @xmath161 , according to the strong dependence on @xmath161 of @xmath197 in the ground state . in this critical region",
    "the eigenvalues of ( [ ham ] ) present many level crossings , which means that the maximum value of @xmath161 we were able to reach ( @xmath198 ) is not large enough to perform a sensible finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "however , we expect that this phase becomes ergodic in the thermodynamic limit , although still different from the ergodic phases e - i and e - ii",

    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the issue of ergodicity , after a brief historical overview , within the green s function formalism by means of the equations of motion approach .",
    "we have individuated the primary source of non - ergodic dynamics for a generic operator in the appearance of zero - frequency anomaly in its correlation functions and given a recipe to compute the unknown quantities characterizing such a behavior within the composite operator method .",
