    "the single parton scattering contribution , calculated in the high energy approximation , turned out to be rather small .",
    "this should be checked in exact @xmath111 parton model calculations in the future .",
    "we have shown that the dps mechanism of @xmath112 production gives a new significant contribution to inclusive charmed meson spectra .",
    "for instance the description of the inclusive atlas , alice and lhcb data is very difficult in terms of the conventional sps ( @xmath0 ) contribution @xcite .    since we have shown that the dps mechanism gives significant contribution to inclusive spectra of charmed mesons the estimate of dps effects , presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and based on experimental inclusive cross section , leads to an overestimation of the dps effect .    summarizing , the present study of @xmath8 reaction in the @xmath1-factorization approach has shown that this reaction is an extremely good testing ground of double - parton scattering effects .",
    "the lhcb kinematics is not the best in this respect .",
    "both atlas and cms collaborations could measure the production of pairs of @xmath2 and/or @xmath4 mesons with large rapidity distance where the dps mechanism is predicted to clearly dominate over the sps mechanism . another potentially interesting place to investigate dps effect is the @xmath113 reaction @xcite .",
    "similarly as for @xmath42 discussed here , the large rapidity gap between two @xmath114 s should select clear sample of dps mechanism .",
    "the authors thank ivan belyaev and marek szczekowski for useful discussions of many aspects of the lhcb experimental data and wolfgang schfer for discussion of single parton scattering contribution .",
