    "unification theories applied to cosmology suggest a possibility of variation of the fundamental constants in the expanding universe ( see e.g. review @xcite ) . there are hints of variation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in quasar absorption spectra , big bang nucleosynthesis and oklo natural nuclear reactor data ( see @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "@xmath8 is the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) scale , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the quark and electron masses .",
    "however , the majority of publications report only limits on possible variations ( see e.g. @xcite ) . a very sensitive method to study the variation in a laboratory",
    "consists of the comparison of different optical and microwave atomic clocks ( see e.g. measurements in @xcite ) .",
    "an enhancement of the relative effect of @xmath6 variation can be obtained in a transition between almost degenerate levels in dy atom @xcite .",
    "these levels move in opposite directions if @xmath6 varies .",
    "an experiment is currently underway to place limits on @xmath6 variation using this transition @xcite , but unfortunately one of the levels has quite a large linewidth and this limits the accuracy .",
    "an enhancement of 1 - 5 orders exists in narrow microwave molecular transitions @xcite .",
    "some atomic transitions with enhanced sensitivity are listed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that there may be a five orders of magintude enhancement of the variation effects in the low - energy transition between the ground and the first excited states in the @xmath0th nucleus .",
    "the exsitence of the enhancement was confirmed in @xcite .",
    "this transition in @xmath0th was suggested as a possible nuclear clock in ref .",
    "indeed , the transition is very narrow .",
    "the width of the excited state is estimated to be about @xmath11 hz  @xcite ( the experimental limits on the width are given in @xcite ) .",
    "the latest measurement of the transition energy  @xcite gives @xmath12 ev , compared to earlier values of @xmath13 ev @xcite and @xmath14 ev @xcite .",
    "this makes @xmath0th a possible reference for an optical clock of very high accuracy , and opens a new possibility for a laboratory search for the variation of the fundamental constants .",
    "large interest in experiments exploring this possibility was expressed , for example , in e. hudson and e. peik talks at special workshop ( 14 - 18 july 2008 , perimeter institute ) devoted to the variation of the fundamental constants and privite communications of e. peik , p. beiersdorfer , zheng - tian lu , d. demille , d. habs and j. torgerson .",
    "this motivated us to perform an independent calculation of the sensitivity of the transition frequency @xmath15 to the variation of @xmath6 based on the following relation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the contribution of the coulomb interaction to the energy spacing between these two levels .",
    "the calculation of the difference in total coulomb energy between ground and excited nuclear states can hardly be done within existing nuclear models with the required accuracy .",
    "instead , the calculation of the correction to the coulomb energy when one proton or one neutron is added into a single particle orbital @xmath18 is a much simpler problem .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0th nucleus is @xmath19=[633\\,5/2^+]$ ] ; i.e. the deformed oscillator quantum numbers are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , the projection of the valence neutron orbital angular momentum on the nuclear symmetry axis ( internal z - axis ) is @xmath22 , the spin projection @xmath23 , and the total angular momentum and the total angular momentum projection are @xmath24 .",
    "the excited state is @xmath19=[631\\,3/2^+]$ ] ; i.e. it has the same @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the values @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are different . with relation to the variation of alpha , we shall discuss below the contribution of the coulomb interaction to the energy spacing between these two levels .",
    "we start from an even @xmath28th nucleus and calculate the shift of nuclear coulomb energy when an odd particle is added into single particle state @xmath18 . in an even nucleus the coulomb energy can be presented as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the charge density . for uniformly charged sphere",
    "we obtain the well known expression @xmath31 which gives for z=90 , and a=228 , the estimate , @xmath321 gev .",
    "the above equation can also be used to estimate the change in the coulomb energy when one neutron is added .",
    "an addition of the neutron changes a , a@xmath33a+1 , therefore @xmath34 that gives for @xmath17 the value of the order of -1 mev .",
    "this estimate gives some average macroscopic value for @xmath17 because in reality it depends on the state @xmath18 where we put the neutron .",
    "adding an odd particle to the state @xmath18 we obtain a change in the charge density @xmath35 where @xmath30 is the charge density of a neighbor even nucleus .",
    "for the change in the coulomb energy eq.([eq1 ] ) we obtain @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the single particle coulomb potential @xmath38 although @xmath28th is a deformed nucleus , for the estimates we shall neglect a small quadrupole component in the charge density @xmath30 .",
    "effects of deformation will be discussed below . in approximation of uniformly charged sphere @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a coulomb radius of @xmath28th , @xmath41fm .",
    "we use this very simple form in order to obtain an estimate for the change in the coulomb energy when going from one nuclear state to another state , and not in the absolute value .",
    "the ground state of the nucleus @xmath0th is polarized due to the addition of the nucleon to the @xmath28th core .",
    "the added nucleon introduces an admixture of the monopole state ( which is a radial excitation ) @xcite and the nuclear state is now : @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the ground state and the isovector monopole in @xmath28th and @xmath44 is the wave function of the added nucleon . with @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a two - body nuclear interaction .",
    "now we evaluate the coulomb energy of this new polarized state @xmath47 .",
    "the correction is : @xmath48 @xmath49 is the coulomb potential .",
    "this correction can be written in the form : @xmath50 @xmath51 is the transition density between the ground state and the monopole : @xmath52 the z / a factor takes into account the fact that only protons interact via the coulomb .",
    "one form used for the monopole transitions is : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a constant and @xmath58 is the ground state density .",
    "this form for the transition density corresponds to a change obtained by uniformly expanding the nucleus , but also can be derived from a sum rule @xcite .",
    "this transition density has a node . because of the node in @xmath59 the result for",
    "the polarization correction will be sensitive to the spatial form of the wave function @xmath44 , and even may change sign for different single - particle states .    to obtain a quantitative estimate",
    "let us switch to the particle - hole basis @xmath60 instead of the single monopole resonance @xmath43 .",
    "the correction to the charge density introduced in eq.([eq2 ] ) can be presented as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the single - particle wave function , and @xmath63 is the correction to the proton density matrix of a neighbohr even nucleus , due to the odd nucleon added into the state @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 here @xmath66 is the proton density matrix of the neighbohr even nucleus .",
    "the equation for @xmath63 can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "it states @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the matrix element of effective residual interaction between quasi - particles .",
    "the first term in r.h.s . of eq.([eq8 ] ) exists only for an odd proton .",
    "if the odd particle is a neutron , this term is absent .",
    "the second term is the polarization correction which exists both for an odd proton and an odd neutron .    in the first order in proton neutron residual interaction we obtain for the correction to the proton density matrix @xmath71 where the state @xmath72 refers to a neutron .",
    "the correction to coulomb energy becomes @xmath73 eq.([eq10 ] ) can be presented in the following way , @xmath74 here we introduced the correction to potential energy @xmath75 that describes the reaction of the proton core to the presence of an additional neutron @xmath76 it follows from eqs.([eq10],[111 ] ) that the correction @xmath75 does not depend on the neutron state .",
    "however , its mean value given by eq.([eq11 ] ) does depend on the particular state @xmath77 .",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath75 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "this radial dependence shown is typical for a double charged layer . due to small compressibility of a nucleus",
    "the change of a charge density can take place on nuclear surface only , and in good approximation it can be presented as a double charged layer .",
    "the mean value of the correction @xmath75 over nuclear volume is negative and equal to -440 kev . due to oscillating behavior",
    ", the expectation value of @xmath75 will obviously be state dependent .    the calculations for @xmath0th were performed using nilsson wave functions @xcite for the valence neutron in order to account for deformation . in @xmath0th the ground state",
    "has the quantum numbers [ 633 5/2 + ] while the excited state has [ 631 3/2 + ] .",
    "both of them belong to n=6 shell where the possible angular momenta in the nilsson orbitals are l=2 , 4 , 6 .",
    "the shift of coulomb energy calculated due to add of valence neutron into these states is shown in table 1 .",
    "note , that the shift for @xmath78 and @xmath79 becomes positive .",
    "the radial wave function for l=6 has a sharp peak near nuclear surface where @xmath75 is positive .",
    "the state @xmath79 has smaller binding energy and its peak , compared to @xmath78 state , is shifted to larger r where @xmath75 becomes negative .",
    "this leads to a smaller value of the shift for @xmath79 state .",
    "the difference between the first excited state with quantum numbers [ 631 3/2 ] and the ground state [ 633 5/2 ] in @xmath0th is extremely small ( @xmath80 10 ev ) and can not be reproduced in nilsson model at reasonable deformation @xmath81 . with the standard parameters of the nilsson model @xcite these two levels are crossed at the deformation @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , we calculated the difference in coulomb energies @xmath83 at different deformations , as a function of the parameter @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the spin - orbit constant .",
    "the result is shown in fig.2 for @xmath86 .",
    "this interval corresponds to deformations @xmath87 .",
    "note that the difference becomes negative at the deformations @xmath88 .",
    "however , the position of this interval depends on the parameters of the nilsson model , while the fact that the difference changes sign at some deformation remains in all sets of the parameters . the value of @xmath2 as a function of deformation changes from 1.5 mev at zero deformation down to -0.5 mev at @xmath89 . in our approach we can hardly give a better estimate , due to simplified treatment of deformation .",
    "however , very small value of the coulomb energy shift seems unprobable . note that near the nilsson level crossing the difference of the coulomb energies is about 1 mev .",
    "the shift of the order from several tens kev to several hundreds kev provides an enhancement of sensitivity to changes of @xmath6 , as it was mentioned in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the frequency shift from eq.([eq0 ] ) may be presented in the following form @xmath90 this shift is four to five orders of magnitude larger than the shift which was studied in optical atomic clocks @xcite ) .",
    "an additional enhancement may be due to the very small width of this transition ( @xmath11 hz  @xcite ) .",
    "it is also instructive to present the relative enhancement : @xmath91 these estimates confirm conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that experiments with @xmath0th have potential to improve sensitivity of laboratory measurements of the variation of the fundamental constants up to 8 orders of magnitude .    n.a .",
