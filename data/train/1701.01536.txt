    "decomposing the proton spin into the spin and orbital angular momentum contributions of its quark and gluon constituents has been a prominent endeavor of hadronic physics since the groundbreaking emc experiments @xcite revealed that quark spin , by itself , does not account for the entirety of proton spin .",
    "in particular , quantifying the parton orbital dynamics already meets challenges at the conceptual level . in a gauge theory",
    ", one can not consider the quark degrees of freedom in isolation ; instead , quarks are intrinsically linked to gluonic fields to conform to the strictures of gauge invariance . as a consequence , there is no unique answer to the question of partitioning orbital angular momentum @xcite into a quark and a gluonic contribution .",
    "quark orbital angular momentum will include gluonic effects to a varying degree , depending on the chosen decomposition scheme .",
    "two definitions of quark orbital angular momentum have stood out in particular .",
    "one is the ji decomposition @xcite , which is singled out by quark orbital angular momentum being defined in terms of a quasi - local gauge - invariant operator .",
    "the other is the jaffe - manohar decomposition @xcite , which has the attribute of admitting a partonic interpretation in the infinite momentum frame in the light - cone gauge .",
    "only fairly recently has a ( non - local ) gauge - invariant extension been formulated for the jaffe - manohar definition of quark orbital angular momentum @xcite , which opens the perspective of calculating not only ji , but also jaffe - manohar quark orbital angular momentum in lattice qcd .",
    "as will be discussed in detail below , the difference between the two definitions can be encoded in differently shaped gauge links in a nonlocal quark bilinear operator .",
    "in fact , by deforming the gauge link in small steps between the two limits , it will be possible to construct a gauge - invariant , quasi - continuous interpolation between ji and jaffe - manohar quark orbital angular momentum .",
    "hitherto , no direct evaluation of quark orbital angular momentum has been available in lattice qcd .",
    "specifically ji quark orbital angular momentum has been calculated indirectly @xcite as the difference between total angular momentum and spin , @xmath1 , taking advantage of ji s sum rule @xcite relating @xmath2 to generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) . here",
    ", a first exploration of a direct approach to calculating quark orbital angular momentum in lattice qcd is presented , based on a construction of a wigner distribution of quark positions and momenta in the proton . utilizing this wigner distribution ,",
    "average partonic orbital angular momentum can be evaluated directly from the cross - product of position and momentum .",
    "ideas complementing the approach followed here have also been laid out in @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned wigner distribution is derived from the nonlocal quark bilinear operator mentioned further above , and thus allows one to access a continuum of quark orbital angular momentum definitions , including the ji and jaffe - manohar ones , by varying the gauge link between the quark operators .",
    "such wigner distributions are related , through fourier transformation , to generalized transverse momentum - dependent parton distributions ( gtmds ) @xcite , which differ from standard tmds only by the relevant proton matrix elements being evaluated at non - zero momentum transfer .",
    "thus , many of the concepts and techniques employed in the following are derived from those used in lattice tmd studies @xcite .",
    "in a longitudinally polarized proton propagating with large momentum in the @xmath3-direction , the @xmath3-component of the orbital angular momentum of quark partons can be evaluated directly in terms of their impact parameter @xmath4 and transverse momentum @xmath5 given an appropriate wigner distribution of those quark characteristics @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the longitudinal quark momentum fraction .",
    "note that , since mutually orthogonal components of quark position and momentum are being evaluated , no conflict with the uncertainty principle arises .",
    "an appropriate wigner distribution @xmath8 is given by the following fourier transform with respect to the conjugate pair of transverse vectors @xmath4 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 in terms of the helicity - non - flip components of the correlator @xmath11 , which is of the type that defines generalized transverse momentum - dependent parton distributions ( gtmds ) @xcite , @xmath12 several comments are in order regarding this expression . in ( [ wignerft ] ) and ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) , @xmath9 denotes the ( transverse ) momentum transfer to the proton , which carries momenta @xmath13 , @xmath14 and helicities @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath16 in the initial and final states , respectively ; @xmath17 is in the 3-direction .",
    "this is a generalization of the correlator used to define transverse momentum - dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) @xcite to non - zero momentum transfer ; it thus includes information on the parton impact parameter @xmath4 , resolved via the fourier transformation ( [ wignerft ] ) , in addition to the parton momentum information encoded via the quark operator separation @xmath18 .",
    "the correlator ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) furthermore depends on the form of the gauge link @xmath19 connecting the quark operator positions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , along with a soft factor @xmath22 $ ] required to regulate the divergences associated with @xmath19 .",
    "this soft factor is identical to the one used for tmds , since ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) only differs from the standard tmd correlator by the choice of external states , while retaining the same bilocal operator .",
    "the divergences regulated by @xmath22 $ ] are associated with the latter , not the former .",
    "this has been explored more concretely in @xcite . in the development further below , appropriate ratios of correlators will be considered in which the soft factors cancel , in analogy to previous lattice tmd studies @xcite ; as a result , it is not necessary to specify @xmath22 $ ] in detail here , beyond a simple symmetry to be noted below .",
    "two important concrete choices for the gauge link are a staple - shaped gauge link path , as employed in the definition of tmds , and a straight gauge link path .",
    "a staple - shaped gauge link path is used , e.g. , to encode final state interactions of the struck quark in a deep - inelastic scattering process , and yields jaffe - manohar quark orbital angular momentum @xcite ; a straight gauge link path omits these final state interactions , and yields ji quark orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two definitions of orbital angular momentum can thus be interpreted as the torque accumulated owing to final state interactions experienced by a quark exiting the proton after having been struck by a hard probe @xcite . in the lattice calculations pursued in the present work , staple - shaped gauge link paths with varying staple lengths",
    "will be treated , @xmath23 \\label{udef}\\ ] ] where the gauge link connects the points given as the arguments of @xmath19 in ( [ udef ] ) with straight wilson lines , cf .",
    "also fig .",
    "[ staplefig ] .",
    "the vector @xmath24 encodes the direction of the staple , the length of which is scaled by the parameter @xmath25 . for @xmath26 , the gauge link degenerates to a straight link connecting the points @xmath27 and @xmath21 directly . in the notation adopted below , also negative values of @xmath25 will be used , to denote a staple extending in the direction opposite to @xmath24 .    by allowing for continuous variation of @xmath25",
    ", the results obtained in the present work will interpolate continuously and gauge - invariantly between the @xmath26 ji limit and the large @xmath28 jaffe - manohar limit ; note that quark orbital angular momentum is an even function of @xmath25 . in the convention adopted below",
    ", the @xmath29 branch will correspond to a struck quark gradually gathering up torque as it is leaving the proton , owing to final state interactions .",
    "the direction @xmath24 of the staple is associated with the path of the struck quark in , e.g. , a deep - inelastic scattering process ; in such a process , the wilson lines forming the legs of the staple - shaped gauge link represent eikonal approximations of gluon exchanges in the final state . here , the standard tmd specification @xcite @xmath30 will be followed .",
    "since such a hard process is characterized by a large rapidity difference between the struck quark and the initial hadron , a straightforward choice of @xmath24 which suggests itself would be a light - cone vector . however , this choice leads to severe rapidity divergences @xcite , which in the factorization framework developed in @xcite are regulated by taking the staple direction @xmath24 off the light cone into the spacelike region .",
    "the correlator ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) can consequently be characterized in lorentz - invariant fashion by the additional collins - soper type parameter @xmath31 in terms of which the light - cone limit is recovered for @xmath32 .",
    "note that the specification @xmath30 implies that the soft factor @xmath22 $ ] does not depend on the direction of @xmath33 , the transverse part of the quark operator separation @xmath18 ; one can freely rotate @xmath33 in the transverse plane while keeping all other geometric characteristics of the gauge link fixed . in the following",
    ", the notation @xmath22 \\equiv { \\cal s } ( z_t^2 ) $ ] will be adopted to emphasize this form of the dependence on @xmath33 , suppressing dependences on other aspects of the geometry of the gauge link @xmath19 .    an important point to note",
    "is that adopting a scheme in which @xmath24 is chosen to be spacelike is crucial to enable a lattice qcd evaluation of the proton matrix element in ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) .",
    "since lattice qcd employs a euclidean time dimension to project out the hadronic ground state , no physical temporal extent can be accomodated in the quark bilocal operator of which one is taking the matrix element .",
    "all separations must be purely spatial . only if @xmath24 is generically spacelike can one boost the problem to a lorentz frame in which @xmath24 becomes purely spatial , and perform the calculation in that frame . note that , in such a frame , large @xmath34 are realized by large spatial proton momenta @xmath35 , cf .",
    "( [ zetadef ] ) .",
    "specifically , in the calculations to follow , @xmath24 will point purely in longitudinal direction , @xmath36 , and , consequently , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 denoting the proton mass . note furthermore that , in the @xmath26 limit , the vector @xmath24 ceases to play an independent physical role as the direction of propagation of the struck quark , and thus @xmath34 ceases to encode a rapidity difference between the proton and the struck quark . nevertheless , in the specific frame employed for the lattice calculation",
    ", one can still use @xmath36 to construct the parameter @xmath34 , which then merely continues to characterize the proton momentum in that frame . throughout the developments below",
    ", @xmath34 will consistently serve to parametrize the approach to the physical limit .",
    "of course , the set of proton momenta which will be accessible in practice in the concrete lattice calculation will be limited ; as in lattice tmd calculations @xcite , extracting information about the large @xmath34 regime presents a challenge in the present calculational framework .    inserting ( [ wignerft ] ) into ( [ oamwdef ] )",
    ", one obtains quark orbital angular momentum in terms of the gtmd correlator ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) , @xmath39 note that the gtmd correlator ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) is parametrized by the gtmds @xmath40 , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xmath41 u(p,\\lambda ) \\label{wparam}\\ ] ] inserted into the particular structure ( [ lwppmm ] ) , only the @xmath42 contribution survives , and one obtains an expression for quark orbital momentum in terms of this gtmd @xcite , @xmath43 since it is cast purely in terms of momenta , this formulation is best suited for phenomenological applications . the natural setting for a lattice calculation , on the other hand ,",
    "is not @xmath44-space , but instead @xmath18-space , i.e. , one calculates directly the proton matrix element in ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) . inserting ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) into ( [ lwppmm ] ) ,",
    "quark orbital angular momentum takes the form @xmath45 thus , in terms of the @xmath18 and @xmath46 variables preferred for a lattice qcd calculation , no fourier integrals over the generated data are necessary to extract quark orbital angular momentum ; this significantly facilitates the numerical analysis . the expression ( [ ldercomb ] ) can still be brought into a more compact form .",
    "owing to the symmetric treatment of both the momentum transfer @xmath9 and the spin , replacing the proton helicities in ( [ ldercomb ] ) by proton spins pointing into the fixed positive and negative @xmath3-directions , respectively , only generates correction terms in ( [ ldercomb ] ) which vanish as @xmath47 .",
    "secondly , the two terms in ( [ ldercomb ] ) then yield identical contributions to quark orbital angular momentum , and one can therefore confine oneself to evaluating either one of the two terms . thus , quark orbital angular momentum can be evaluated more simply as @xmath48 note that , formally , one might consider taking the soft factor outside the @xmath33-derivative in the limit @xmath49 , since the soft factor depends only on the magnitude of @xmath33 , not its direction .",
    "however , in the presence of a lattice cutoff , the derivative with respect to @xmath33 will be realized as a finite difference , and the limit @xmath49 has to be taken with care . for this reason",
    ", the soft factor is left inside the derivative at this stage , deferring a more precise treatment to the practical implementation of ( [ ldersingle ] ) in the presence of a lattice cutoff .",
    "the form ( [ ldersingle ] ) for quark orbital angular momentum is not directly amenable to lattice evaluation , because the soft factor in the collins factorization scheme @xcite is not accessible in lattice qcd ; it contains wilson line structures of varying rapidities , not all of which can be simultaneously boosted to a single instant , a prerequisite for lattice evaluation limit , in which the staple direction vector @xmath24 ceases to play a physical role ; this case was discussed in detail in @xcite . ] . as in previous lattice tmd studies",
    "@xcite , this is addressed by forming an appropriate ratio with an additional quantity , such that the soft factors cancel .",
    "a convenient choice of such a second quantity can be constructed via the unpolarized tmd @xmath50 .",
    "this tmd is obtained from the gtmd @xmath51 in the limit of vanishing momentum transfer @xcite , and thus from the correlator ( [ gtmdcorr ] ) as , cf .  the parametrization ( [ wparam ] ) , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 could likewise be used ) . on the other hand ,",
    "integrating @xmath54 over all momenta yields the number of valence quarks , @xmath55 having inserted the explicit form of @xmath56 , cf .",
    "( [ gtmdcorr ] ) , and also having used that , for @xmath57 , positive helicity corresponds to spin in the @xmath3-direction .",
    "now , comparing ( [ ndenom ] ) with ( [ ldersingle ] ) , the two matrix elements contain the same operator , associated accordingly with the same soft factor ; one can therefore envisage canceling the soft factors by taking an appropriate ratio .",
    "care has to be taken , however , in defining the @xmath49 limit . at a finite lattice spacing @xmath58 , distances smaller than @xmath58",
    "can not be resolved , and the @xmath33-derivative in ( [ ldersingle ] ) is realized as a finite difference .",
    "it therefore necessarily involves values of the correlator ( [ ldersingle ] ) at finite @xmath33 for any given finite lattice spacing @xmath58 . denoting @xmath59 ( where , for conciseness of notation , all other dependences are being omitted in the argument of @xmath60 )",
    ", one can specify @xmath61 with a fixed number of lattice spacings @xmath62 , which approximates the derivative as @xmath63 .",
    "one may contemplate using @xmath64 in order to mitigate lattice artefacts ; this will be revisited in the discussion of numerical results below .",
    "note that , since the soft factor does not depend on the direction of @xmath33 , but only its magnitude , the two terms in the finite difference are associated with an identical soft factor , which can therefore be factored out .    in order to use ( [ ndenom ] ) to form a ratio in which the soft factor cancels",
    ", one has to accordingly specify the limit @xmath49 as @xmath65 which is independent of the transverse direction @xmath66 used and approximates ( [ ndenom ] ) as @xmath63 in a way which matches the manner in which ( [ ldiscrete ] ) approximates ( [ ldersingle ] ) , i.e. , using values of @xmath67 at finite @xmath68 for any given finite lattice spacing @xmath58 . combining ( [ ldiscrete ] ) and ( [ ndiscrete ] ) , one obtains the renormalized ratio @xmath69 ( where sums over @xmath70 are still implied ) , in which the soft factors , and also any multiplicative renormalization constants attached to the quark operators in @xmath67 have canceled .",
    "the ratio ( [ rdiscrete ] ) is the expression evaluated in practice in the lattice qcd calculation to be discussed below .",
    "note that also the derivative with respect to @xmath9 in practice will have to be approximated by a finite difference .",
    "however , contrary to the treatment of the @xmath49 limit , the @xmath47 limit is not associated with ultraviolet divergences and is conceptually straightforward , even if it poses numerical challenges , to be discussed further below .",
    "besides considering the ratio ( [ rdiscrete ] ) for fixed @xmath62 , such that @xmath71 for @xmath63 , one can also consider the regime of fixed finite physical distance @xmath72 and define a generalized , @xmath73-dependent quark orbital angular momentum @xmath74 in analogy to , e.g. , the generalized tensor charge defined in @xcite . keeping @xmath73 finite effectively acts as a regulator on @xmath5-integrations such as the ones in ( [ oamwdef ] ) and ( [ lf14 ] ) .",
    "as the quark operators in @xmath67 , eq .  ( [ phicorr ] ) , approach each other , i.e. , in the limit @xmath49 once one has set @xmath75 , the correlator becomes singular .",
    "in particular , even if one has properly renormalized @xmath60 , at face value , its derivative @xmath76 in general will formally still be divergent at @xmath77 ; in @xmath5-space , this translates to the observation that , even if one has properly defined the gtmd @xmath42 , cf .",
    "( [ wparam]),([lf14 ] ) , its @xmath5-moment ( [ lf14 ] ) still exhibits an ultraviolet divergence .",
    "however , at any given resolution scale , differences in @xmath33 smaller than that scale are not resolvable , and thus a consistent interpretation of the @xmath33-derivative is in terms of a finite difference taken over a distance commensurate with the resolution scale ; the aforementioned singularity occurring at arbitrarily small distances is not resolved .",
    "as one increases the resolution , probing the ultraviolet behavior more fully , one not only evaluates the @xmath33-derivative using smaller distances ; one concomitantly evolves @xmath60 to the higher resolution scale .",
    "the combined effect of these adjustments ultimately produces the proper evolution of the orbital angular momentum @xmath78 .",
    "an explicit observation of this evolution will not be possible in the present work , since calculations were performed only at one fixed lattice spacing @xmath58 ; it would be interesting to pursue an evolution study in future work employing data at a sequence of lattice spacings @xmath58 .    in this context ,",
    "also further remarks regarding the multiplicative nature of the soft factors and the quark field renormalizations , and their consequent cancellation in the ratio ( [ rdiscrete ] ) , are in order .",
    "the absorption of divergences into these multiplicative factors is , to begin with , a construction motivated by the continuum theory @xcite .",
    "that it carries over analogously into the lattice formulation is a working assumption which has been discussed in some detail in @xcite , and was further explored empirically in @xcite by investigating whether tmd ratios vary under changes of the lattice discretization scheme .",
    "absence of such variations strengthens the hypothesis that the data provide a good representation of the universal continuum behavior within statistical accuracy ; conversely , violations of the multiplicative nature of renormalization would presumably manifest themselves in deviations from a universal continuum limit . on the one hand , at finite physical separations @xmath33 , one would expect that the lattice operators approximate the continuum operators well and inherit their divergence structure ; indeed , in @xcite , results for tmd ratios obtained using differing discretization schemes were consistently found to coincide once @xmath33 extends over several lattice spacings . on the other hand ,",
    "the limit of small @xmath33 deserves further scrutiny .",
    "as already noted above , the @xmath49 limit , in particular the @xmath33-derivative @xmath76 in that limit , in general contains additional divergences ; using different lattice discretization schemes will have an effect analogous to using different combinations of data obtained at varying @xmath62 to construct the @xmath33-derivative , cf .",
    "( [ ldiscrete ] ) .",
    "moreover , mixing between the various composite local operators arising in the @xmath49 limit can occur , potentially modifying the simple multiplicative renormalization pattern . in the empirical study @xcite , the stability of tmd ratios under changes of the lattice discretization scheme",
    "was generally seen to persist into the small @xmath33 regime , indicating that the data continue to represent the universal continuum limit well , with the notable exception of the worm - gear shift @xmath79 , for which significant deviations between different discretization schemes were observed .",
    "the sivers shift @xmath80 , which is the tmd ratio most directly related to the ratio ( [ rdiscrete ] ) considered here , exhibited no such deviations .",
    "apart from performing an analogous study also directly for the ratio ( [ rdiscrete ] ) , another opportunity to cross - check the behavior of ( [ rdiscrete ] ) for the need for additional renormalization will ultimately be provided by a comparison of the @xmath26 ji limit with the result for quark orbital angular momentum obtained using ji s sum rule , on the same lattice ensemble .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the numerical data generated to date will not yet permit definite conclusions in this regard ; at the present stage , the aforementioned comparison is affected by significant other systematic uncertainties as well , as discussed further below .",
    "numerical data for the present study were generated employing a mixed action scheme in which the valence quarks are realized as domain wall fermions , propagating on a @xmath81 dynamical asqtad quark gauge background .",
    "the corresponding gauge ensemble was provided by the milc collaboration @xcite .",
    "a fairly high pion mass , @xmath82 , was used for this exploration in order to reduce statistical fluctuations .",

    "the uncertainties given for the hadron masses are , in that order , statistical , and stemming from the conversion to physical units via @xmath58 .",

    "as far as the gauge link geometries are concerned , the focus of the present investigation is on small values of the quark separation @xmath33 , and therefore only the restricted range of @xmath84 in table  [ tab_2 ] was treated ; it is possible to obtain a numerical signal at larger @xmath33 , cf .  the tmd investigations @xcite . on the other hand , the staple length index @xmath85 covered all values for which a numerical signal is discernible .",

    "[ jiplot ] displays the isovector ji quark orbital angular momentum for all available values of @xmath34 , together with an extrapolation to infinite @xmath34 using the fit ansatz @xmath105 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this ad hoc ansatz , which will be used repeatedly in the following , is not motivated by any theoretical argument at this point , but has merely been observed to provide a good fit of data in a previous investigation of the boer - mulders tmd ratio @xcite , for which an analogous extrapolation in @xmath34 is performed .",
    "the extrapolation is thus intended to give simply a heuristic idea of where the @xmath34 limit may plausibly be located .",
    "the extrapolated value is confronted with the one obtained on this same lattice ensemble from the standard evaluation of quark orbital angular momentum via ji s sum rule @xcite . while the sum rule value lies within two statistical standard deviations of the extrapolated value , a genuine discrepancy between the two is in fact expected , as discussed at the end of the previous section .",
    "the replacement of the @xmath9-derivative in ( [ rdiscrete ] ) by a finite difference using a rather large value of @xmath106 represents a substantial underestimate , possibly by up to a factor of two .",
    "the discrepancy seen in fig .",
    "[ jiplot ] is compatible with this expectation .",
    "indeed , if the extrapolated value in fig .",
    "[ jiplot ] were to be enhanced by a factor of two , it would overshoot the sum rule value , but still be consistent with it within statistical uncertainty .",
    "it thus does not seem implausible to expect that an accurate estimate of the @xmath9-derivative in future numerical work will lead to consistent results for ji quark orbital angular momentum from the present direct evaluation method and the standard sum rule evaluation . in order to roughly cancel the systematic bias stemming from the underestimate of the @xmath9-derivative in the discussion of the @xmath107 results below",
    ", data will be presented relative to the @xmath26 ji value .    the dependence of quark orbital angular momentum on the staple length @xmath25 represents the most interesting feature of the present investigation . as discussed in section  [ oamsec ] ,",
    "while the @xmath26 case corresponds to ji quark orbital angular momentum , the @xmath108 limit yields jaffe - manohar quark orbital angular momentum , which , contrary to the former , has hitherto not been accessible within lattice qcd .",
    "the difference between the two can be interpreted @xcite as the integrated torque , due to the final state interactions encoded in the staple - shaped gauge link , accumulated by the struck quark in a deep inelastic scattering process as it is leaving the proton . since ,",
    "in the present calculation , the staple length can be varied in small steps , one in fact obtains a quasi - continuous , gauge - invariant interpolation between the ji and jaffe - manohar limits .",
    "this is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ etaplot ] , which shows the variation of isovector orbital angular momentum with the staple length parameter @xmath25 ; the three panels correspond to the three available values of the collins - soper parameter @xmath34 . in each of the panels , following",
    "the change of orbital angular momentum as @xmath25 grows corresponds to observing the struck quark gather up torque on its trajectory leaving the proton , until it reaches the jaffe - manohar limit .",
    "note that the data are displayed in units of ( the magnitude of ) ji quark orbital angular momentum , obtained at @xmath26 .",
    "the effect of the final state interactions seen in the data is substantial .",
    "it can be clearly resolved even within the limited statistics employed in the present exploratory calculation , and it enhances quark orbital angular momentum compared with the initial ji value . as seen in fig .",
    "[ etaplot ] , the effect increases with rising collins - soper parameter @xmath34 , approaching magnitudes such that the integrated torque accumulated in reaching the jaffe - manohar limit amounts to as much as roughly half of the initial ji orbital angular momentum carried by the quark .",
    "the increasing behavior with @xmath34 also implies that the effect is likely to survive extrapolation to the @xmath32 limit . a corresponding extrapolation , again employing the fit ansatz @xmath105 , is exhibited in fig .  [ torqueplot ] .",
    "shown are data for the integrated torque @xmath109 i.e. , the difference between jaffe - manohar and ji quark orbital momentum , in units of the magnitude of ji quark orbital momentum .",
    "a signal is indeed obtained in the @xmath32 limit . note",
    "that the integrated torque @xmath110 corresponds to a qiu - sterman type correlator @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath110 presented here amounts to an evaluation of that genuine twist - three term .",
    "all data presented above concern the isovector @xmath100 quark combination , in which disconnected diagrams cancel . of interest is also the decomposition by flavor , shown in figs .",
    "[ flav_etaplot ] and [ flav_torqueplot ] . in these flavor - decomposed data ,",
    "disconnected contributions are omitted ; they are , however , expected to be minor at the heavy pion mass used for the present calculation .",
    "[ flav_etaplot ] exhibits quark orbital angular momentum as a function of staple length parameter @xmath25 , for a fixed value of the collins - soper parameter @xmath34 , analogous to fig .",
    "[ etaplot ] . displayed",
    "are data for the @xmath62 quark and for the two @xmath111 quarks , i.e. , @xmath112 for @xmath111 quarks has been multiplied by 2 to compensate for @xmath113 in the @xmath111 quark case .",
    "displayed furthermore is the total ( isoscalar ) quark orbital angular momentum , which was obtained here simply by adding the aforementioned `` @xmath62 '' and `` @xmath114 '' contributions ( at finite statistics , this may differ slightly from evaluating instead @xmath115 ) . the data are again given in units of the magnitude of the isovector ji quark orbital angular momentum , i.e. , in fig .",
    "[ flav_etaplot ] at @xmath26 , the difference between the `` @xmath114 '' and `` @xmath62 '' data is unity .    the flavor - separated data in fig .",
    "[ flav_etaplot ] reproduce the well - known cancellation between the @xmath62- and @xmath111-quark orbital angular momenta in the proton @xcite , which combine to yield only a small negative residual contribution to the spin of the proton at the pion mass used in the present study .",
    "this property persists as one departs from ji quark orbital momentum and adds torque to arrive at jaffe - manohar quark orbital momentum .",
    "[ flav_torqueplot ] displays results for the integrated torque , cf .",
    "( [ torquedef ] ) , in analogy to fig .",
    "[ torqueplot ] , including extrapolations of the data at different collins - soper parameters @xmath34 to the @xmath32 limit .",
    "the results at @xmath116 exhibit fairly large statistical fluctuations , which may be the source of the seemingly uncharacteristic behavior of the @xmath62-quark data point .",
    "it would be natural to expect monotonous behavior as a function of @xmath34 , and the aforementioned data point may thus well represent a downward fluctuation ; it leads to an extrapolated @xmath62-quark torque compatible with zero , driving the isoscalar combination to negative values ( albeit with a large statistical uncertainty ) .",
    "another , more physical , reason to suspect a spurious downward fluctuation in this case is that final state interaction effects on quark transverse momenta in the proton generally tend to be stronger for a @xmath62-quark than a ( single ) @xmath111-quark , as embodied , e.g. , in the sivers shift or the boer - mulders shift @xcite this suggests that a subtle interplay between transverse positions and momenta of the quarks would be needed to generate a deviating pattern for the integrated torque .",
    "indeed , the substantial statistical uncertainties at @xmath116 do in fact still render the data compatible with a @xmath62-quark integrated torque that is stronger than a ( single ) @xmath111-quark integrated torque .",
    "a higher statistics calculation is needed to draw definite conclusions on this point . at present , in view of the sizeable uncertainties , the extrapolated results are nevertheless compatible with the conclusions drawn above from fig .",
    "[ flav_etaplot ] at the fixed value @xmath117 .",
    "the present exploration demonstrates the feasibility of calculating the quark orbital angular momentum in a proton in lattice qcd directly , using a wigner distribution - based approach . given a wigner distribution of quark parton positions and momenta in the transverse plane with respect to proton motion , one can directly evaluate their average cross product , i.e. , longitudinal orbital angular momentum .",
    "the wigner distribution in question can be derived from appropriate proton matrix elements @xcite . as is familiar from the definition of transverse momentum - dependent parton distributions ( tmds ) ,",
    "transverse momentum information can be extracted by employing a quark bilocal operator ; the transverse quark separation in this operator is fourier conjugate to the quark transverse momentum . on the other hand , by generalizing the tmd matrix element to non - zero momentum transfer , the tmd information is supplemented with impact parameter information .",
    "one thus arrives at generalized transverse momentum - dependent parton distributions ( gtmds ) @xcite , which , appropriately fourier - transformed , yield the desired wigner distribution . in view of this construction , many of the concepts and techniques employed in lattice tmd studies @xcite can be brought to bear on the direct evaluation of quark orbital angular momentum in a proton .    in order to define a gauge - invariant observable",
    ", the bilocal tmd operator must contain a gauge connection between the quarks .",
    "different choices of the path along which the connection is evaluated encode different definitions of quark orbital angular momentum @xcite , including the ji and jaffe - manohar definitions .",
    "the approach developed here has thus opened the possibility of going beyond the lattice studies of quark orbital angular momentum carried out to date , which were limited to calculating specifically ji orbital angular momentum via ji s sum rule .",
    "indeed , the present investigation has provided a quasi - continuous , gauge - invariant interpolation between ji and jaffe - manohar orbital angular momentum , by deforming the gauge connection path in small steps .",
    "the difference between the two definitions is given by burkardt s torque @xcite , i.e. , the integrated torque accumulated by the struck quark in a deep inelastic scattering process as it is leaving the proton ; it corresponds to a genuine twist - three , qiu - sterman type correlator .",
    "the aforementioned interpolation allows one to directly follow the gradual accumulation of this torque along the quark s path .    the gauge connection contained in the bilocal tmd operator is associated with ultraviolet divergences which , in the continuum collins factorization scheme @xcite , are absorbed into multiplicative soft factors appearing alongside the renormalization factors associated with the quark fields . as in lattice",
    "tmd studies , also in the present context an appropriate ratio can be formed in which these factors cancel ; it is assumed that their multiplicative nature carries over into the lattice formulation .",
    "the renormalized quantity evaluated in effect is @xmath118 , the longitudinal quark orbital angular momentum component in units of the number of valence quarks , for the quark flavor under consideration . accessing this quantity entails , in particular , evaluating the derivative of the relevant proton matrix element with respect to the quark separation @xmath33 in the employed quark bilocal operator , in the limit of vanishing @xmath33 .",
    "this limit must be taken with care owing to the associated ultraviolet singularities .",
    "the behavior of the gathered data with varying @xmath33 was considered in particular , revealing a fairly stable behavior that suggests that the aforementioned @xmath33-derivative can be extracted unambiguously in the continuum limit .",
    "this is a prerequisite for the application of the method .",
    "the principal new physical insight gleaned from the present exploration concerns the behavior of jaffe - manohar quark orbital angular momentum relative to its ji counterpart .",
    "their difference , burkardt s torque , is clearly resolvable in the data and is sizeable , amounting to roughly one half of ji quark orbital angular momentum .",
    "the torque enhances jaffe - manohar quark orbital angular momentum relative to ji quark orbital angular momentum .",
    "as already noted above , the data gathered within this investigation provide a quasi - continuous , gauge - invariant interpolation between the two limits .",
    "the most significant shortcoming of the data set obtained in the present exploration is the limited set of proton momenta , both in the longitudinal and the transverse directions . in particular ,",
    "only one fairly large value of the momentum transfer @xmath9 in the transverse plane is available , and the @xmath9-derivative necessary to extract orbital angular momentum is substantially underestimated by the finite difference obtained using the aforementioned @xmath9 value .",
    "thus , while the above conclusions concerning the relative comparison between jaffe - manohar and ji quark orbital angular momentum are presumably robust with respect to this systematic bias , in absolute terms , the results extracted systematically underestimate the quark orbital angular momentum present in the proton .",
    "this , indeed , is manifested clearly in the case of ji orbital angular momentum , through the comparison with the corresponding indirect ji sum rule lattice evaluation on the same ensemble .",
    "removing this systematic bias is foremost on the agenda for future work .",
    "a calculation is in preparation which will incorporate a direct method to evaluate the @xmath9-derivative exactly @xcite , related to twisted boundary conditions on the quark fields .",
    "the aforementioned comparison with the standard evaluation of ji orbital angular momentum via ji s sum rule will provide a valuable benchmark for the removal of systematic bias .",
    "moreover , the data are to be extrapolated to large collins - soper parameter @xmath34 , realized in the employed lorentz frame via large proton momenta . although the availability of several longitudinal proton momenta in the gathered data set allowed for an ad hoc estimation of the large-@xmath34 limit , calculations at larger proton momenta are clearly desirable . in this respect , the improved proton sources explored in @xcite provide a perspective for generating data that permit a more quantitative treatment of the large-@xmath34 limit .",
    "further topics for future exploration include the investigation of varying lattice spacing @xmath58 , with a view towards studying , in particular , the @xmath63 behavior of the @xmath33-derivative discussed above , as well as observing the evolution of the extracted quark orbital angular momentum .",
    "also , efforts to approach the physical pion mass in these calculations must be undertaken . on a more theoretical level ,",
    "a decomposition of the proton matrix element under consideration into lorentz - invariant amplitudes , analogous to the one employed in lattice tmd studies @xcite ought to provide valuable further insight into the systematics of the data and aid in the extrapolation to large @xmath34 , cf .",
