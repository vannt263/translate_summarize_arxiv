    "in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in the study of initial - value formulations of general relativity .",
    "this interest has been motivated mainly by the desire of rewriting the einstein system of evolution equations in an explicit hyperbolic form , so that it can be solved numerically using modern high resolution methods from fluid dynamics  @xcite .",
    "one can separate the new hyperbolic formalisms according to the way in which they treat the evolution of the lapse function @xmath1 .",
    "some formulations assume the existence of an arbitrarily prescribed gauge , _",
    "i.e. _ the lapse is an arbitrary function of spacetime known _ a priori _",
    "@xcite ( ` prescribed gauge ' formalisms ) .",
    "other formulations include the lapse function as part of the system of dynamical variables , and postulate for it an evolution equation that guarantees the hyperbolicity of the _ whole _ system , geometry plus gauge ( ` hyperbolic gauge ' formalisms ) .",
    "the resulting formalisms remain hyperbolic for any _ prescribed _ shift vector .",
    "prescribed gauge formalisms , though certainly useful theoretically , might have a limited applicability in numerical relativity simply because there is no recipe that can give us the _ a priori _ form of the lapse except in trivial cases ( for example ) .",
    "hyperbolic gauge formalisms on the other hand , by allowing the lapse functon to adapt itself to the evolution of the geometry while maintaining the hyperbolic structure of the system of equations , would appear to be much more promising .",
    "hyperbolic gauge formalisms , however , are probably more susceptible to a problem that seems to have been overlooked until know . by rewriting the whole evolution system ( gauge plus geometry ) in hyperbolic form ,",
    "they open up the possibility of running into a well known non - linear effect associated with hyperbolic systems : the appearance of shocks . here",
    "i use the term ` shock ' in a somewhat loose form to refer to a discontinuous solution that develops from smooth initial data , without worrying about the existence of weak solutions or jump conditions .",
    "the fact that in vacuum general relativity one can have shock fronts is well known @xcite . by shocks fronts , however , one generally understands discontinuities in the curvature of spacetime present in the initial data that propagate with the speed of light . in the theory of non - linear hyperbolic equations such solutions",
    "are not considered proper shocks , but are called instead ` contact discontinuities ' . here",
    ", however , i will consider the existence of discontinuous solutions that arise from smooth initial data even in a flat spacetime .",
    "clearly those solutions do not correspond to a physical discontinuity in the geometry of spacetime .",
    "instead the discontinuities indicate regions where our coordinate system becomes pathological : the time slices can become non - smooth , or a spatial coordinate might map a finite proper distance to an infinitesimal interval .",
    "it is for this reason that i shall refer to them as ` coordinate shocks ' .",
    "even though modern high resolution numerical methods can deal with the presence of shock waves , clearly the appearance of coordinate shocks is something that must be avoided . in the first place ,",
    "coordinate shocks create completely artificial discontinuities in solutions that otherwise represent perfectly smooth geometries .",
    "not only that , but since in general our gauge conditions are not obtained from a conservation law , we will not have an analogue of the ` weak solutions ' to such laws .",
    "this means that after a shock forms our gauge conditions will just break down , and even if the numerical solution remains well behaved , _ it will not have any clear physical meaning_. in particular , as the numerical mesh is refined , the solution will not converge after the formation of the shock .",
    "in this paper i will concentrate in one particular hyperbolic formalism of general relativity , the bona - mass ( bm ) formalism @xcite , and i will show how these coordinate shocks can and do indeed develop even in very simple situations .",
    "in this section i will make a brief introduction to the bm hyperbolic formalism for general relativity .",
    "i will use the most recent form of this formalism as presented in  @xcite .",
    "let us start from the standard 3 + 1 formulation of general relativity of arnowitt , deser and misner ( adm )  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations for the metric @xmath2 and extrinsic curvature @xmath3 are :    [ eq : adm1 ] @xmath4 \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the lapse function , @xmath5 the shift vector , and where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the components of the ricci tensor for the spatial hyper - surfaces and for the full spacetime respectively . in",
    "what follows i will restrict myself to the case of zero shift vector .",
    "the adm equations then reduce to :    [ eq : adm2 ] @xmath8 \\;\\ ; .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to obtain a system that is first order in space we introduce the following quantities : @xmath9    the evolution equation for @xmath3 can then be rewritten as : @xmath10    where we have defined : @xmath11    with : @xmath12    the source term @xmath13 in equation  ( [ eq : kev ] ) involves only the fields themselves and not their derivatives : @xmath14    we also need an evolution equation for the @xmath15 .",
    "this we obtain by taking the spatial derivative of the evolution equation for @xmath2 : @xmath16    the quantities @xmath17 defined in  ( [ eq : vdef ] ) are very important",
    ". their evolution equation can be obtained from  ( [ eq : dev ] ) . in order to ensure hyperbolicity , however , it is crucial to modify the resulting equation using the momentum constraints to obtain : @xmath18    where : @xmath19    and where @xmath20 is the einstein tensor of the spacetime .",
    "the quantities @xmath17 are now considered independent , and equation  ( [ eq : vdef ] ) becomes an algebraic constraint that must be satisfied by the physical solutions .    finally , we need evolution equations for the lapse @xmath1 and its derivative @xmath21 , _ i.e. _ we need to choose a slicing condition . in the bm formalism",
    "the following slicing condition is used : @xmath22    with @xmath23 but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "the complete system of evolution equations then takes the form :    [ eq : evolution1 ] @xmath24    and :    [ eq : evolution2 ] @xmath25    to study the characteristic structure of the system of equations  ( [ eq : evolution1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : evolution2 ] ) we choose a fixed space direction @xmath26 and consider only derivatives along that direction .",
    "it can then be shown that the system is hyperbolic with the following structure :  . ]    * 25 fields propagate along the time lines ( zero speed ) .",
    "these fields are : @xmath27 * 10 fields propagate along the physical light cones with speeds : @xmath28 + these fields are : @xmath29 * 2 fields propagate with the ` gauge speeds ' : @xmath30 + they are : @xmath31",
    "here i will try to understand the nonlinearities present in our system of equations , trying in particular to determine whether shocks can develop . from the discussion in the previous section it is clear that the system of evolution equations in the bm formalism has the following structure :    [ eq : system ] @xmath32    the fluxes @xmath33 that appear in the above equations have the form : @xmath34    where the coefficients @xmath35 are functions of the @xmath36 s but not of the @xmath37 s .",
    "let us now call @xmath38 the eigenvalues and @xmath39 the corresponding eigenvectors of the jacobian matrix @xmath40 .",
    "let us also introduce the matrix @xmath41 $ ] of column eigenvectors .",
    "the eigenfields @xmath42 are then defined by : @xmath43    a given eigenfield @xmath42 is called ` linearly degenerate '  @xcite if the following condition holds : @xmath44    since in our case the @xmath45 s do nt depend on the @xmath37 s , it is obvious that all the eigenfields are linearly degenerate .    in the case of systems of conservation laws where the sources vanish , linear degeneracy is enough to guarantee that no shocks will form .",
    "however , when the sources are non - zero , this is not true anymore .",
    "this is easy to see if we consider for a moment the prototype of non - linear hyperbolic equations , burgers equation : @xmath46    if we now define : @xmath47    then we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq : burgues ] ) as the system :    @xmath48    this has precisely the form  ( [ eq : system ] ) .",
    "the only eigenvalue turns out to be equal to @xmath36 which is clearly independent of @xmath37 . by the definition above the system",
    "is linearly degenerate .",
    "however , it is clearly non - linear and will generate shocks since it is only burgues equation in disguise .",
    "the nonlinearities have now been buried in the sources .",
    "clearly the condition that must be imposed to guarantee that no shocks will develop is that a given eigenvalue @xmath38 should not be affected by changes in the corresponding eigenfield @xmath42 .",
    "the condition for linear degeneracy  ( [ eq : degeneracy1 ] ) asks for the eigenvalue not to be explicitly dependent on its associated eigenfield . in the presence of sources , however , the coupling can introduce an indirect dependency . in order to study this dependency",
    "let us consider the time evolution of @xmath38 : @xmath49    now , we want this time derivative to be independent of the eigenfield @xmath42 : @xmath50    i shall call this condition ` indirect linear degeneracy ' and i will refer to condition  ( [ eq : degeneracy1 ] ) as ` explicit ' or ` direct ' linear degeneracy .",
    "if we assume that the condition for explicit linear degeneracy holds , then the condition for indirect linear degeneracy can be reduced to : @xmath51    which can be rewritten as : @xmath52    this condition must supplement the condition for explicit linear degeneracy  ( [ eq : degeneracy1 ] ) if we want to guarantee that no shocks will develop .",
    "let us now apply the previous condition to the bm system of evolution equations  ( [ eq : evolution1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : evolution2 ] ) . from the discussion of the previous section it is clear that , on a given spatial direction @xmath26 we only have the following non - trivial eigenvalues : @xmath53    the time derivative of @xmath54 will then be : @xmath55 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\pm \\ , { \\lambda^l}_\\pm \\ ; \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\alpha } \\ ; \\partial_t \\ , \\alpha \\,-\\ , \\frac{g^{xm } \\ , g^{xn}}{2 \\ , g^{xx } } \\ ; \\partial_t \\ , g_{mn } \\right ] \\;\\ ; .",

    "if we want @xmath70 to be independent of @xmath71 , and hence satisfy the condition for indirect linearly degeneracy , we must clearly ask for : @xmath72    this differential equation can be easily solved to give : @xmath73    with @xmath0 an arbitrary constant . we must in fact take @xmath74 in order to ensure that we will have @xmath75 for all @xmath76 .",
    "we have then show that the function @xmath77 must have the form  ( [ eq : fcondition ] ) in order to guarantee that the eigenfields @xmath71 will not generate shocks .",

    ", it will therefore remain true even in the case of harmonic slicing .",
    "one must stress here the fact that we havent actually proved that shocks will indeed develop . whether they do or not in any particular case should depend in a critical way on the form of the initial data .    in the following sections i will consider some examples that show how coordinate shocks can indeed develop even in very simple cases .",
    "as a first example , consider a flat two - dimensional spacetime ( a ` 1 + 1 ' spacetime ) with coordinates @xmath81 .",
    "notice that these coordinates do not have to correspond to the minkowski coordinates @xmath82 , so we can have a non - trivial evolution even though the spacetime is flat . since we only have one spatial dimension , i will simplify the notation in the following way : @xmath83    notice that the variable @xmath84 is identically zero .",
    "the system of evolution equations  ( [ eq : evolution1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : evolution2 ] ) reduces in this case to :    @xmath85    and :    @xmath86    the characteristic structure of this system is very simple :    * there are 3 fields that propagate along the time lines ( speed zero ) .",

    "since we are dealing with a flat spacetime , the only way to obtain a non - trivial evolution is to start with a non - trivial initial slice .",

    "this is easy to understand geometrically : any discontinuity in @xmath138 must necessarily be accompanied by an infinite value of @xmath142 ( we must jump a finite radial distance in an infinitesimal interval ) .",

    "this is known since the bm formalism has been used before to solve this problem and no shocks have been observed  @xcite .",
    "the reason why shocks do nt develop is that they are a consequence of transport and as such they should only develop when we have wave propagation , either in the form of real gravitational waves , or in the form of pure gauge waves .",

    "we can clearly see the two pulses resulting from our initial perturbation .",
    "the pulse moving inwards has developed a shock : the variables @xmath137 have developed large gradients , while @xmath141 have developed sharp spikes .",
    "the angular metric component @xmath138 has also developed a large gradient .",
    "i have introduced a general approach to the study of shock development in hyperbolic systems of equations with sources .",
    "i have shown that the usual condition of explicit linear degeneracy ( direct linear degeneracy ) must be supplemented with a new condition which i have called ` indirect linear degeneracy ' in order to guarantee that no shocks will develop .",
    "i have applied this condition of indirect linear degeneracy to the bm hyperbolic formalism of general relativity in the case of a zero shift vector .",
    "my analysis has shown how two distinct families of characteristic fields can give rise to shocks .",
    "numerical simulations have confirmed these predictions in the simple cases of a flat two - dimensional spacetime , a flat four - dimensional spacetime with spherically symmetric slices , and a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime .",
    "the appearance of shocks that develop from smooth initial data in vacuum general relativity comes as a great surprise .",
    "these shocks , however , do not represent discontinuities in the geometry of spacetime , but indicate instead regions where our coordinate system becomes pathological . it is for this reason that i refer to them as ` coordinate shocks ' .    of the two families of coordinate shocks found , one can be completely eliminated by choosing a bm gauge function @xmath103 of the form : @xmath163    with @xmath164 an arbitrary constant . for @xmath165 , however , this form of the function @xmath77 will not be very useful in spacetimes with large curvatures .",
    "the reason for this is easy to see . even thought the condition will prevent the formation of shocks",
    ", it implies an evolution equation for the lapse of the form : @xmath166    clearly , in a region where the lapse has collapsed to a very small value we will have : @xmath167    if @xmath168 , there is nothing to prevent the lapse from becoming negative ( this can in fact happen very easily in black hole simulations ) .",
    "we are then led to the conclusion that the only value of @xmath77 that will prevent the first family of shocks from developing without carrying the risk of leading to a negative lapse is @xmath169 , _",
    "i.e _ harmonic slicing .",
    "the second family of shocks , on the other hand , is independent of the form of @xmath77 and arises even for harmonic slicing .",
    "this is a very unexpected result .",
    "after all , this is precisely the slicing used to prove the theorems of existence and uniqueness of solutions in general relativity  @xcite . since at a shock the differential equations break down",
    ", one would expect the theorems to forbid such solutions .",
    "we must remember , however , that these theorems can only be proved _ locally _ , they can not therefore rule out a shock that develops after a _ finite time_.    it must be stressed that the violation of indirect linear degeneracy is not a sufficient condition for the development of shocks .",
    "the choice of initial data will have a crucial effect in whether or not shocks actually develop .",
    "in particular , since shocks are a consequence of transport , they should only develop when we have wave propagation , either in the form of real gravitational waves , or in the form of pure gauge waves as was shown in the examples presented here .",
    "of course , in the simple cases considered in this paper one can easily find initial data that does not produce shocks : for the flat spacetimes one can just take a flat initial slice , while for a black hole spacetime we can start from an unperturbed schwarzschild slice . in the more general case , however , it might be difficult to find such benign initial data , or even to prove that it exists at all .",
    "one more important point should be made here .",
    "since the shocks that i have found arise in the case of a zero shift vector , they must necessarily indicate a break down of the slicing condition .",
    "that is , the shocks represent places where the spatial hyper - surfaces become non - smooth . since the presence of a shift vector can not alter the geometry of these hyper - surfaces , the shocks found here must appear for _ any shift condition_. a given shift might eliminate the discontinuities in some components of the spatial metric , but it can not eliminate the shocks completely : at least some of the dynamical quantities will remain non - smooth for all possible shift choices .",
    "although in this paper i have concentrated in the bm hyperbolic formalism , the mathematical tools developed can easily be applied to any other hyperbolic formalism of general relativity .",
    "one should expect the phenomena of coordinate shocks to also arise in any such formalism .",
    "in fact , since all formalisms must have the same physical solutions , the results of this paper imply that in _ any formalism _ the use of a harmonic slicing will generate shocks for at least some initial conditions .",
    "clearly , the search for gauge conditions and/or restrictions on the initial data that can prevent the development of coordinate shocks is a problem that must be addressed if hyperbolic formalisms are to become an important tool in the study of both theoretical and numerical relativity .",
    "the author wishes to thank gabrielle  d.  allen , carles  bona , joan  mass and bernard  f.  schutz for many useful discussions and comments .",
