    "trace inequalities are useful in many areas such as the multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) systems in control theory and communications .",
    "the trace inequality derived in this paper is used to prove the sufficient condition that guarantees the uniqueness of a nash equilibrium in certain mimo communications games with @xmath8 players ( see @xcite for details ) . to be more specific , the diagonally strict concavity condition of rosen @xcite is proven to be satisfied in the scenario of @xcite .",
    "the trace inequality under discussion has already been proven in two special cases : in @xcite for @xmath9 and in @xcite for @xmath10 . in what follows",
    ", we will provide the proof for the general case where @xmath1 is arbitrary .",
    "[ lemma_k ] let @xmath11 be a strictly positive integer , @xmath3 , @xmath4 be any positive definite matrices and @xmath12 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 be any positive semidefinite matrices . then @xmath13 \\right\\ } \\geq   0,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 denotes the matrix trace operator .",
    "in order to prove theorem [ lemma_k ] , we will use the following auxiliary results .",
    "@xcite [ lemma_3 ] let @xmath14 , @xmath15 be two positive definite matrices and @xmath16 , @xmath17 be two positive semidefinite matrices and @xmath18 a hermitian matrix .",
    "then @xmath19    the proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ lemma_4 ] let @xmath14 , @xmath15 be two positive definite matrices , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , two positive semi - definite matrices .",
    "then @xmath20    to prove this result , let us define @xmath21 as follows : @xmath22\\right\\}\\ ] ] we observe that @xmath21 can be written in two different ways : @xmath23({\\mathbf}{a}+{\\mathbf}{c})^{-1}\\right\\ } \\\\ & = & \\mathrm{tr } \\left\\{({\\mathbf}{c}-{\\mathbf}{d})({\\mathbf}{b}+{\\mathbf}{d})^{-1}({\\mathbf}{c}-{\\mathbf}{d})({\\mathbf}{a}+{\\mathbf}{c})^{-1}\\right\\ } + \\\\ & & \\mathrm{tr } \\left\\{({\\mathbf}{c}-{\\mathbf}{d})({\\mathbf}{b}+{\\mathbf}{d})^{-1}({\\mathbf}{a}-{\\mathbf}{b})({\\mathbf}{a}+{\\mathbf}{c})^{-1}\\right\\ } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xmath24({\\mathbf}{b}+{\\mathbf}{d})^{-1}\\right\\ } \\\\ & = & \\mathrm{tr } \\left\\{({\\mathbf}{c}-{\\mathbf}{d})({\\mathbf}{a}+{\\mathbf}{c})^{-1}({\\mathbf}{c}-{\\mathbf}{d})({\\mathbf}{b}+{\\mathbf}{d})^{-1}\\right\\ } + \\\\ & & \\mathrm{tr } \\left\\{({\\mathbf}{c}-{\\mathbf}{d})({\\mathbf}{a}+{\\mathbf}{c})^{-1}({\\mathbf}{a}-{\\mathbf}{b})({\\mathbf}{b}+{\\mathbf}{d})^{-1}\\right\\}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] using this fact and the commutative property of the trace of a matrix product , the desired result follows directly .",
    "the only thing left to be proven is that @xmath21 is real . to this end , if we denote by @xmath25 , we observe that @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we obtain that @xmath27 and also @xmath28 .",
    "define , for all @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "notice that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are positive definite matrices .",
    "we observe that @xmath34 can be re - written recursively as follows : @xmath35 we proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we find a lower bound for @xmath34 and then we prove that this bound is positive .",
    "we start by proving that , for all @xmath1 : @xmath36 to this end we proceed by induction on @xmath11 .",
    "for all @xmath1 , define the proposition : @xmath37 it is easy to check that , for @xmath9 , @xmath38 is true : @xmath39 now , let us assume that @xmath40 is true and prove that @xmath41 is also true .",
    "we have that :              the last step of the proof of theorem [ lemma_k ] reduces to showing that the term on the right side of the equality ( c ) is positive .",
    "this can be easily checked by observing that all the terms of the form @xmath47 , with @xmath18 a hermitian matrix , @xmath14 and @xmath15 two positive definite matrices , can be re - written as @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "thus , for all @xmath8 , @xmath50 and the desired result has been proven .",
