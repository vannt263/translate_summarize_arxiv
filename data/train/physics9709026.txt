    "when using monte carlo methods to study physical systems one is usually faced with the problem of _ critical slowing - down _ ( csd ) in the critical region were a typical correlation length of the system diverges . that is , the auto - correlation time of traditional monte carlo algorithms , the time it takes to generate `` statistically independent '' configurations , grows rapidly with system size .",
    "for example , for the well known metropolis and heat - bath algorithms this time grows linearly with the system size , making simulations of large systems prohibitively time consuming .",
    "it is thus very important to construct new monte carlo algorithms that can reduce csd .",
    "much progress has been made in this direction ; examples of improved algorithms are , to name a few : adler s overrelaxation @xcite , fourier acceleration @xcite , multigrid @xcite and cluster algorithms @xcite .",
    "those algorithms have been applied successfully to variety of models and , in some special cases , have eliminated csd altogether .",
    "this , though , is usually accomplished only for relatively simple models , such as free field theories or spin models with simple interactions . for more complicated models , where sophisticated methods are harder to implement ,",
    "the improvement is usually somewhat less .    in this paper",
    "we study the performance of two such improved algorithms , overrelaxation and multigrid , in simulations of _ crystalline membranes_. crystalline membranes are internally rigid surfaces , embedded in three dimensions , with an extrinsic curvature term .",
    "they exhibit a phase transition between a high - temperature crumpled and a low - temperature flat phase .",
    "it is especially in the flat phase , and at the _ crumpling _ transition , that monte carlo simulations with traditional algorithms suffer from very long auto - correlations .    as with many interesting models , the hamiltonian of a crystalline membrane is too complicated for a direct implementation of the methods we want to employ .",
    "some simplifications have to be made . for the overrelaxation",
    "we use a quadratic approximation to the hamiltonian when choosing a new trial position  this requires an additional accept - reject step to restore detail balance .",
    "this is usually referred to as _ hybrid _ overrelaxation . instead of multigrid",
    "we use a simpler implementation , the _ unigrid _ algorithm , in which a coarsening transformation of the field configuration is not needed  the fields at the original ( fine ) lattice are simulated at all levels .",
    "in addition to the performance of the algorithms , we also examine the importance of randomness in the updating procedure , i.e.  the order in which the fields are updated . according to standard folklore , too much randomness in the updating procedure",
    "increases csd as the system takes a drunkard s walk through the phase space . too little noise ,",
    "on the other hand , increases csd as well since the system is too weakly ergodic .",
    "it is thus important to tune the amount of randomness in the algorithm appropriately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the particular model of a crystalline membrane we study , discuss the problems of the simulations and the performance of the metropolis algorithm . in section 3",
    "we describe the hybrid overrelaxation algorithm and our approximation . in section 4",
    "we test the performance of the unigrid algorithm . finally ,",
    "in the section 5 , we compare the overall performance and merits of those different methods and comment on possible further improvements and applications .",
    "the model we simulate is a simple discretization of a phantom ( non self - avoiding ) crystalline membrane , inspired by the polyakov action for euclidean strings with extrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "a discrete crystalline membrane is described by a regular two - dimensional triangulation embedded in three - dimensional space where it is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "the hamiltonian is composed of two terms : a pair potential between neighboring nodes and a bending energy term . as a pair potential",
    "we use a simple gaussian spring potential , and we model the bending energy by a ferromagnetic interaction between neighboring normals to the faces of the surface : @xmath5 here @xmath6 label the intrinsic position of the nodes , @xmath7 is the corresponding position in the embedding space , @xmath8 is a normal to a triangle @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the bending rigidity .",
    "the partition function is given by the trace of the boltzmann weight over all possible configurations of the embedding variables @xmath11 : @xmath12 \\ ; \\delta ( \\vec{r}_{cm } ) \\ ;   \\exp \\left ( - { \\cal h}[\\vec{r}\\ , ] \\ , \\right ) .\\ ] ] the center of mass of the membrane , @xmath13 , is kept fixed to eliminate the translational zero mode .",
    "as there is no self - avoidance term in the hamiltonian , this model describes a phantom surface .",
    "this model has been studied extensively with numerical methods @xcite .",
    "it has been found to have a high - temperature crumpled ( disordered ) phase and a low - temperature flat ( ordered ) phase , separated by a continuous phase transition  the _ crumpling _ transition .",
    "the behavior of the system in the flat phase is governed by an infrared stable fixed point at @xmath14 ; the whole flat phase is critical .",
    "the existence of an ordered phase in a two - dimensional system with a continuous symmetry and short range interactions is remarkable , given the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "what stabilizes the flat phase are the out - of - plane fluctuation of the membrane that couple to the in - plane phonon degrees of freedom due to non - vanishing elastic moduli .",
    "bending of the membrane is necessarily accompanied by an internal stretching . by integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom ,",
    "one is left with an effective hamiltonian with long - range interactions between the gaussian curvature fluctuations .",
    "most numerical simulations so far have used either local updating methods , usually the metropolis algorithm , or fourier acceleration . the metropolis algorithm ,",
    "apart from suffering from csd , has very long auto - correlations both in the flat phase and close to the crumpling transition . to establish this",
    "we have simulated the model eq .",
    "( [ e22 ] ) , using the metropolis algorithm , on a @xmath15 square lattice , @xmath16 ranging from 8 to 64 , and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we choose to simulate the model in the flat phase , at @xmath17 , were we know from previous simulations that the auto - correlation time is indeed very long @xcite .    to estimate the auto - correlations we measure the _ square radius of gyration _",
    ": @xmath18 i.e.  the linear extent of the membrane in the embedding space .",
    "this is usually the `` slowest mode '' of the system . from this",
    "we construct the normalized auto - correlation function @xmath19 and the integrated auto - correlation time ( measured in units of sweeps ) @xmath20 this is shown in table  1 .",
    "the errors on the auto - correlation times are estimated from 10 to 20 independent runs , each few hundred @xmath21 long .",
    ".the integrated auto - correlation time @xmath21 ( in number of sweeps ) , together with the cpu - time per sweep @xmath22 ( in ms ) .",
    "column @xmath23 is for a lexicographic update of nodes , while _",
    "( b ) _ is for random updating . from a linear fit to eqs .",
    "( [ e26 ] ) and ( [ e27 ] ) we get the exponents @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the corresponding amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath27 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as before , we have simulated a crystalline membrane in the flat phase and for lattice sizes @xmath28 and 64 , using the unigrid algorithm and updating the system at each level with the metropolis algorithm .",
    "we repeated the simulation both for a @xmath29 and @xmath30cycle . in table",
    "3 the show the measured value of the auto - correlation and cpu - times , from which we determine the overall performance of the algorithm : @xmath31 in both cases the unigrid algorithm reduces csd , albeit not very much , but enough to make it worthwhile for large membranes . for the @xmath30cycle",
    "this implies a dynamical csd exponent @xmath0 , although this value is probably to large , as we observe strong finite size effects in the fit to eq .",
    "( [ e26 ] ) ; if we exclude the smallest volume ( @xmath32 ) , we get @xmath33 . in conclusion , although the @xmath30cycle is more time consuming per sweep , its performance is better than @xmath29cycle in simulations of membranes of size @xmath34 .",
    "comparing the performance of these different algorithms , eqs.([perf1 ] ) , ( [ perf2 ] ) , and ( [ perf3 ] ) , we see that , in the simulation of crystalline membranes on realistic lattice sizes ( @xmath16  =  10 to 200 ) , both the hybrid overrelaxation and the unigrid algorithm reduce the computational cost by an order of magnitude over the metropolis algorithm . as the unigrid algorithm also reduces the dynamical exponent @xmath35 , especially using a @xmath30cycle , it is clearly the best choice for large membranes . in the particular case we studied in this paper , large means @xmath36 , although this value may depend on the simulation parameters ( i.e.  @xmath10 ) .",
    "we would also like to emphasize that , in order to achive optimal performance of the hybrid overrelaxation , it is imperitive to adjust the noise in the updating procedure ( to use lexicographic updating ) , and to tune the `` normalization '' parameter @xmath37 appropriatly .    an alternative algorithm used to simulate crystalline membranes is a combination of langevin updates with fourier acceleration @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is known to substantially reduce csd , although the gain is lost to some extent in the large computational overhead .",
    "this method is also complicated by systematic errors induced by using a finite time step @xmath38 ; this necessitates an extrapoltion to @xmath39 , which can itself become time consuming .",
    "nevertheless , it would be interesting to know how well this algorithm performes , in realistic simulations , compared to the algorithms we have studied in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have an estimate of its performance in similar conditions ( e.g. , using the same computers ) for comparison .",
    "an obvious extension of the methods studied in this paper , is to combine hybrid overrelaxation with the unigrid algorithm .",
    "it is possible to maximize the shift of a block in a unigrid update , by choosing it in a deterministic and energy preserving way , improving the performance even further .",
    "this is though more complicated to implement and it is under investigation .",
    "there are few application in which the hybrid overrelaxation might be more advantageous compared to the unigrid algorithm .",
    "overrelaxation can be parallelized in a straightforward manner , although it could be difficult to define a lexicographic update in that case .",
    "it also easy to adapt hybrid overrelaxation to modified versions of the model like , for example , _ self - avoiding _ crystalline membranes , which are of great physical interest . in that case ,",
    "a proposed updated is rejected if it leads to self - intersection of the membrane .",
    "intuitively , a non - local change , like one proposed by the unigrid algorithm , is more likely to be rejected  hybrid overrelaxation might turn out to be more effective .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that both these updating algorithms can be used in simulations of _ fluid _ membranes with extrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "in that case , the surface fluctuates in the embedding space , and its connectivity matrix changes dynamically .",
    "it is known that simulations of fluid membranes suffer from even longer auto - correlation times than their crystalline counterparts . for fluid membranes ,",
    "the random nature of the lattice causes some complications in implementing hybrid overrelaxation and unigrid algorithms .",
    "for example , it is not obvious how to define lexicographic ordering .",
    "a possible method would be to propagate the updates outwards from a randomly chosen node , i.e.  by traversing the lattice in steps of increasing geodesic distance from a marked point . for the unigrid algorithm",
    "the problem is that a random lattice can not be divided into regular blocks .",
    "again , blocks could be defined as nodes within a given geodesic distance from some randomly chosen node .",
