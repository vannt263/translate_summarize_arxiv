    "( the one with @xmath157 just corresponds to the trivial bose - mott insulator . )",
    "obviously , one expects there will be a usual @xmath1-@xmath2 transition between the bosonic integer quantum hall phases and the superfluid phase since we have a natural local order parameter if approaching the critical point from the well - defined superfluid phase .",
    "interestingly , it is known that the above fermionic action in fact provides an alternative description for the usual @xmath1-@xmath2 transition,@xcite thus the correctness of the fermionic effective action is justified and it does not violate our basic physical intuition .    for our case",
    ", the t - sdw state has quantized hall conductance @xmath158 while the n - sdw state has vanished quantized hall conductance . in some sense",
    ", one may identify n - sdw and t - sdw states as the superfluid phase and the bosonic integer quantum hall phases in ref .",
    "[ ] , respectively , according to distinct features on the quantized hall conductance .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the critical behaviors of topological quantum phase transition between n - sdw and t - sdw states could fall into the @xmath1-@xmath2 universal class though we can not find a unambiguous bosonic local order parameter for our case .",
    "in our view , the similarity between our case and the bosonic integer quantum hall transition is indeed an interesting new finding and it is desirable to see more examples where some fermionic theories can be dual to certain kinds of bosonic ones.@xcite      a careful reader may wonder whether there exists a similar t - sdw state in the kane - mele - kondo lattice model studied in ref .",
    "we have studied this model by using the same treatment in the present paper .",
    "it is found that the edge states resemble the case in usual 2 + 1d topological insulator , where the gapless helical edge state exists and the spin hall conductance is quantized due to the gapless edge state .",
    "however , in our case the antiferromagnetic order breaks the time - reversal symmetry , thus the gapless helical edge state will be gapped since it can not be stable due to impurities and weak interaction without the protection from the time - reversal symmetry.@xcite physically , the quantized spin hall conductance contributed by such gapless edge state will also be destroyed generically and we conclude that no such t - sdw - like states could appear in the kane - mele - kondo lattice model .",
    "recently , it is noted that in ref .",
    "[ ] , bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model with an extra hubbard interaction has been studied by applying the dynamical mean field theory .",
    "those authors find that the hartree - fock mean - field theory can not capture a topological antiferromagnetic phase , which is verified to exist by their dynamical mean - field theory calculation .",
    "in contrast to the case of the extended bernevig - hughes - zhang model , in the present paper the t - sdw state is well - captured by our mean - field decoupling and is further inspected by effective chern - simon action and chiral edge - state in sec .",
    "we suspect that such difference may result from the different models one used .",
    "it seems that the mean - field decoupling works more effectively in the kondo lattice - like model than in extended bernevig - hughes - zhang model .",
    "maybe , the usual mean - field approach underestimates the effect of spin - orbit coupling in bhz model comparing to dynamical mean - field theory calculation and it will be interesting to clarify this point in future work .",
    "in summary , we have obtained the global ground - state phase diagram of the topological kondo lattice model on the honeycomb lattice at half - filling by using an extended mean - field decoupling .",
    "it is found that besides the well - defined kondo insulator and the normal antiferromagnetic sdw state , there can exist a novel topological sdw state with quantum anomalous hall effect .",
    "the topological sdw state can not be distinguished with the normal antiferromagnetic sdw state in terms of the landau - ginzburg paradigm , specifically , the symmetry - breaking based classification of states .",
    "however , such a novel sdw state can be indeed fully encoded by its low energy effective chern - simon action with gapless chiral edge - state",
    ".    moreover , the phase transition between the two kinds of sdw states is a topological quantum phase transition while a first - order quantum phase transition is found between the kondo insulating state and the antiferromagnetic sdw states .",
    "interestingly , the mentioned topological quantum phase transition can be described by dirac fermions coupled chern - simon gauge - field , which indicates such topological quantum phase transition may fall into the @xmath1-@xmath2 universal class .",
    "it is expected both the global ground - state phase diagram and the novel topological sdw state could be realized by experiments of ultra - cold atoms on the honeycomb optical lattice.@xcite[we note that authors in ref .",
    "[ ] propose that haldane model may be realized by using ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice . in the topological kondo lattice we study ,",
    "the conduction electrons are described by the haldane model while local electrons couple to conduction electrons via magnetic coupling .",
    "building on the haldane model , it is expectable to realize the topological kondo lattice model by adding a magnetic coupling between local electrons and conduction electrons . ]",
    "we hope the present work may be helpful for further studies on the interplay between conduction electrons and the densely localized spins for the honeycomb lattice .",

    "the work was supported partly by nsfc , the program for ncet , the fundamental research funds for the central universities and the national program for basic research of china .",
    "here , we would like to give a brief derivation of the effective chern - simon action eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) from the dirac action eq .",

    "therefore , we may conclude that the gapless chiral edge - state is at least stable under weak impurities or interaction effect as one expects .                                                                                                                using the ground - state energy of antiferromagnetic state [ eq .",
