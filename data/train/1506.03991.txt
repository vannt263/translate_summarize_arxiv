    "it is a monatomically thin , quasi two - dimensional layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice with two sublattices , a and b. due to its atomic structure , it has the lowest surface mass density of all solids [ ] . at the same time , its in - plane mechanical strength is second to no other material [ ] .",

    "spin - orbit couplings are small and nuclear spins are sparse , making it a potentially good host material for spin [ ] .",
    "in addition to the real electron spin , the occupation of sublattices a and b can be described by the sublattice pseudospin . moreover , in momentum space , the occupation of the two inequivalent dirac points  where valence and conduction bands touch  may be denoted by the valley isospin [ ] .",
    "electron spin currents can be injected optically in graphene with rashba - type spin - orbit interaction [ ] . this allows to leave away ferromagnetic contacts , thus eliminating a possible source of spin scattering .",
    "magnetic behavior has been observed at the edges of graphene [ ] .",

    "quantum effects become increasingly relevant as components of information processing devices shrink to the few - nanometer scale .",
    "this poses a challenge but also offers the chance to exploit quantum mechanics for data processing [ ] .",
    "the spin is the canonical example of a quantum mechanical degree of freedom with two eigenstates . in solids",
    ", it is possible to use spin - orbit coupling and many other spin dependent effects to manipulate the spin with electric fields and hence much faster than with external magnetic fields . in order to prepare , manipulate , and detect spin in an active and controlled way",
    ", spintronic devices may take advantage of any such effects [ ] .",
    "in contrast to electronics where carrier mobilities and lifetimes matter , spin mobilities and coherence times are relevant parameters for spintronics .",
    "the coherence of electron spins is mainly determined by the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , the abundance of nuclear spins in the host material , and magnetic behavior .",
    "these characteristics depend on the material and interlink spintronics with material science . due to their lower magnetic moment , nuclear spins couple weakly to the environment and exhibit typical coherence times orders of magnitude longer than for electron spins [ ] .",
    "spintronics promises new applications and substantially better performance than standard micro- and nanoelectronics by exploiting the spin degree of freedom .",
    "hard drive read heads are a multibillion dollar industry and magnetoresistive random - access memory ( mram ) is still waiting in the wings .",
    "both technologies are based on the giant magnetoresistant effect , whose discovery in the late 1980s may be considered the birth of spintronics [ ] . beyond classical computing ,",
    "spintronics has the potential for key components of quantum computing [ ] .",
    "quantum computing can be viewed as a coherent superposition of classical computations running in parallel , with algorithms like the one by shor exploiting this [ ] . obviously , such algorithms require appropriate quantum hardware [ ] .",
    "as proposed by loss and divincenzo , spin states of coupled qds can be used to implement a universal set of one- and two - qubit gates ( _ qubit _ is short for quantum bit ) .",
    "spin qubit gates can be realized with magnetic fields and , using spin - dependent effects , also with electric fields , or a combination of both [ ] . such a solid state approach to quantum computing benefits from the scalability known from standard electronics and from long coherence times [ ] .    the dot regions to which an integer number of electrons can be confined are typically on the length scale of 10 - 100 nanometers .",
    "the eigenstate spectrum is discrete and quantum dots are often referred to as _ artificial atoms_. coulomb repulsion and the exchange coupling also play a role [ ] .    also for spins that are confined to the qd , there remains a coupling to the environment . at finite temperatures , spins and phonons in the host material couple via the admixture mechanism , which involves spin - orbit interaction and electron - phonon coupling , or directly , via spin - orbit interaction only [ ] .",
    "moreover , the hyperfine interaction mediates a coupling between the electron spin and nuclear spins in its vicinity [ ] .",
    "these mechanisms lead to a finite spin lifetime , an important figure of merit for applications like the loss - divincenzo quantum computer where it should exceed the clock time by orders of magnitude [ ] . the theoretical prediction and explanation of spin lifetimes ( in graphene qds ) is part of this review .",
    "its many outstanding properties make graphene , a monatomically thin layer of carbon atoms , an interesting material for a variety of applications , including spintronics .",

    "the probability density of @xmath137 looks similar yet mirrored about the @xmath138-axis [ ] . ]",
    "the two nearby vacancies can be interpreted as a double quantum dot ( dqd ) , whose localized states form a bonding and an antibonding eigenstate within the gnf spectrum .",
    "if the energy splitting @xmath16 between the bonding and antibonding eigenstates is much smaller than their energy differences to the remaining spectrum , the orbital part of the dqd can be described by @xmath139 where we employ the localized states @xmath140 as a basis , @xmath141 is the mean energy of the ( anti-)bonding states , and where the intervacancy hopping with @xmath142 may acquire a peierls phase due to the magnetic field .",
    "symmetry allows us to find the explicit form of @xmath143 , see fig .",
    "we complement this picture with an on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath144 and aim to calculate the exchange coupling @xmath145 , which energetically splits the singlet state @xmath146 from the triplet state @xmath147 and determines their mutual dynamics . within this model and for @xmath148 , we find that the singlet state is preferred , i.e. , antiferromagnetic ordering , and @xmath149 for the exchange coupling .",
    "both @xmath150 and @xmath144 , and hence @xmath145 , depend on the perpendicular magnetic field that is included from the beginning .",
    "typically , the magnetic field has a significant effect when the total magnetic flux through the gnf , @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the surface area of the nanoflake , reaches one flux quantum , @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is planck s constant and @xmath155 is the unit charge .",
    "( solid red line and left axis ) and the eigenenergies ( dashed black lines and right axis ) of the according ( anti-)bonding states are plotted against the perpendicular magnetic field .",

    "depending on the overall size of the gnf , the distance between the vacancies , and the gnf termination ( zigzag or armchair ) , the @xmath80-field dependence can be used to tune @xmath145 over several orders of magnitude . for some flake configurations ,",
    "it is possible to tune the spectrum into a degeneracy , @xmath160 , thus switching off the antiferromagnetic order , see fig .",
    "such an _ in - situ _ tunability of the exchange coupling is most promising for spintronics applications as it allows to change the magnetic behavior without preparing a new device . for flakes with armchair edges , we find that @xmath145 increases for gnfs of larger overall size and for smaller separation distances of the two vacancies .",
    "bulk graphene can be viewed as the limit where the gnf diameter is much greater than the vacancy separation and where edge effects become negligible .",
    "we expect that the former trend saturates in this limit .",
    "the latter trend applies separately for two cases : ( i ) when the atom that has been removed for the vacancy at @xmath161 belongs the a sublattice and ( ii ) when it belongs to the b sublattice .",
    "such trends are not obvious for zigzag terminated flakes , where edge effects play a significant role for gnfs with up to @xmath162 atoms [ ] .",
    "nel temperatures , @xmath163 with the boltzmann constant @xmath164 , range from below @xmath165 to beyond @xmath125 and thus allow for experimental verification of these results , possibly via the techniques mentioned at the beginning of this section . including a non - local coulomb interaction might lead to ferromagnetic ordering , @xmath166 , and possibly enable an _ in - situ _ tunable crossover from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism [ ] .",
    "our method relies on symmetry and hence the removal of an @xmath152 and a @xmath80 atom .",
    "nevertheless , ferromagnetic ordering is expected if the two atoms are removed from the same sublattice and only on - site coulomb interaction is considered [ ] .",
    "we also point out that the exchange coupling @xmath145 can be used for coherent two - qubit operations , as required for universal quantum computing [ ] .",
    "naturally , only 1% of all carbon atoms belong to the isotope @xmath1c , which is the only stable carbon isotope with finite nuclear spin , see table [ t1 ] .",
    "this abundance can be lowered by isotopic purification [ ] .",
    "possibly , this is the reason why the combination of nuclear spins and graphene has so far received little attention from the scientific community .",
    "however , there are at least three situations where nuclear spins become important for spintronics in graphene .",
    "( i ) first , it has been found theoretically that @xmath0 relaxation times of electron spins in graphene qds can exceed @xmath167 for certain parameters and if nuclear spins are neglected , see figs .  [ pic4 ] and [ pic5 ] or refs .",
    "[ ] . in this case ,",
    "the spin dephasing time @xmath168 might be limited by the coupling to nuclear spins of the @xmath1c nuclei .",
    "( ii ) then , state - of - the - art graphene qds often employ a graphene ( bi-)layer encapsulated by bottom and top sheets of hexagonal boron nitride . neither boron nor nitrogen posses any stable isotopes without nuclear spin , see table [ t1 ] .",
    "the spin of an electron in such an encapsulated graphene qd is in immediate contact with the nuclear spins of hbn .",
    "( iii ) finally , the nuclear spin of an impurity , of an adatom , or of @xmath1c itself might be interesting for spintronics .",
    "natural monolayer graphene contains one nuclear spin per @xmath169 surface area .",
    "this density can be controlled by enriching or depleting @xmath1c .",
    "possibly , control and coupling of nuclear spins in the graphene sheet or on top of it can be achieved .",
    "ultimately , this could lead to 2d nuclear spintronics with similarities to nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond , where @xmath1c nuclear spins have been used for quantum operations [ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian for an ensemble of nuclear spins in a solid has five different contributions [ ] , @xmath170 the term @xmath171 arises due to the zeeman energies of nuclear spins in a magnetic field @xmath80 .",
    "the second term describes the hyperfine interaction between electron spins and nuclear spins .",
    "it is the sum of two terms , @xmath172 .",
    "the contact ( isotropic ) hyperfine interaction can be modeled as an overhauser field , @xmath173 , that acts on the electron spin @xmath45 in a similar way as an external magnetic field , @xmath174 here , @xmath175 is the spin operator for the nucleus at site @xmath176 and the coupling strength @xmath177 is proportional to the local probability density of the electron and the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus at site @xmath176 [ ] .",
    "( [ overhauser ] ) vanishes for @xmath3-band electrons ( in particular those of graphene ) as their probability densities at the nuclear sites are zero due to odd symmetry . in this case ( in particular for graphene ) , the anisotropic hyperfine interaction , @xmath178 , and the coupling of nuclear spin and electron orbit , @xmath179 , dominate electron - nuclear coupling .",
    "in addition to @xmath180 , also @xmath179 can mediate a coupling of nuclear and electron spins if spin - orbit interaction is included .",
    "the nuclear dipole - dipole hamiltonian , @xmath181 , directly couples the magnetic moments of distinct nuclear spins . and",
    "nuclei with spin @xmath182 ( thus excluding @xmath1c ) interact with an electric field gradient via the nuclear quadrupolar coupling , @xmath183 .",
    "all these terms are discussed in detail in ref .  [ ] .",
    "spintronics with nuclear spins  point ( iii ) in our list above  would rely on the coupling of nuclear spins to external fields , which is achieved by @xmath171 and @xmath183 , as well as the coupling between different nuclear spins , which is mediated by @xmath181 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the effect of nuclear spins from hbn on the electron spin in encapsulated graphene qds  point ( ii )  have not been studied , yet . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we review studies on point ( i ) , the decoherence of the electron spin due to hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins of @xmath1c .",
    "the contact hyperfine interaction vanishes for flat graphene and indirect coupling of electron and nuclear spins via @xmath179 and spin - orbit interaction is expected to be small and hence neglected .",
    "consequently , the coupling between electron and nuclear spins in graphene is given by @xmath184 where @xmath176 indexes the sites of @xmath1c isotopes .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath185 are proportional to the probability density of the electron at site @xmath176 and the respective coupling strength @xmath186 , with @xmath187 [ ] .",
    "the @xmath188-axis is chosen to be perpendicular to the graphene sheet .",
    "in contrast , the coupling strength of the ( contact ) hyperfine interaction in gaas ranges from @xmath189 to @xmath190 ( depending on the specific isotope ) , thus exceeding that of graphene by more than one order of magnitude [ ] .",
    "the importance of the hyperfine interaction in graphene has been studied by comparing cvd - grown samples consisting entirely of @xmath191c and @xmath1c , respectively [ ] .",
    "the experimental results indicate that in contrast to the cases of gaas or carbon nanotubes , hyperfine interactions with @xmath1c nuclear spins have a negligible effect on spin transport relaxation times in cvd - grown graphene [ ] .    ) for various parameters on a doubly logarithmic scale .",
    "the longitudinal hyperfine coupling strength in graphene is @xmath192 [ ] .",
    "the polarization of the nuclear spin system is assumed to be @xmath193 for the solid lines and @xmath194 for the dashed ones .",
    "for the thin black lines ( left and bottom axes ) , we vary the relative @xmath1c abundance but fix the total number of atoms to @xmath195 , which corresponds to a square qd with an approximate size of @xmath196 . for the thick orange lines ( right and top axes ) ,",
    "we vary @xmath197 and fix the relative @xmath1c abundance to its natural value , @xmath198 . ]",
    "the interaction of an electron spin in a graphene qd with a certain number of nuclear spins , @xmath199 , will affect the time evolution of its transversal component @xmath200 , where @xmath201 .",
    "if @xmath202 , the nuclear spins form a bath and one can use the central limit theorem to obtain @xmath203 [ ] . in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath204 , the electron zeeman energy is much greater than the transversal hyperfine coupling strength @xmath205 .",
    "then , the characteristic decoherence time @xmath206 is given by @xmath207 where @xmath208 denotes the polarization of the nuclear spin system and @xmath197 is the total number of carbon atoms , i.e. , @xmath198 for natural carbon [ ] .",
    "typical values for @xmath206 exceed @xmath209 , see fig .",
    "[ pic8 ] . in a further study",
    ", it was found that in the same situation , the longitudinal spin component @xmath210 is conserved up to small corrections , which oscillate with a frequency determined by the hyperfine interaction [ ] .",
    "if less than roughly 10 nuclear spins interact with the electron spin in the graphene qd , the nuclear spin system can not be modeled as bath but allows for an exact treatment .",
    "then , decoherence times depend on the exact position and orientation of the nuclear spins , and typically lie in the regime of @xmath211 [ ] .",
    "spintronics with individual electron spins in semiconductors has evolved dramatically from basic concepts to universal quantum control of spin states and quantum registers with up to four qds [ ] .",
    "isotopic purification enables coherence times beyond @xmath212 at low temperature in silicon and beyond @xmath211 at room temperature in diamond [ ] .",
    "despite the challenge of efficient spin injection into graphene through tunneling barriers , remarkable improvements in spin transport have been achieved over the past few years [ ] .",
    "in contrast to electron mobility , the spin lifetime seems to be rather insensitive to charged impurity scattering [ ] and can exceed @xmath213 at room temperature [ ] , even for cvd - grown graphene [ ] .",
    "the small intrinsic spin - orbit interaction makes it practically impossible to observe the spin hall effect ( she ) in graphene [ ] .",
    "but controlled hydrogenation can increase the spin - orbit interaction by three orders of magnitude and thus enable the observation of a she at room temperature and zero magnetic field [ ] .",
    "last year , a quantum spin hall state has been observed in graphene with a large , tilted magnetic field [ ] .",
    "graphene qds have been studied thoroughly w.r.t .  their orbital spectrum [ ] , spin - filling sequence [ ] , and charge relaxation times [ ] .",
    "moreover , high - quality bilayer qds , encapsulated in hbn and equipped with electric gates , allow for electrostatic confinement as discussed in subsec .",
    "[ mbgds ] .",
    "small qds in the @xmath214 range can be created by electroburning and exhibit coulomb blockade at room temperature due to addition energies as large as @xmath215 [ ] .",
    "slightly larger graphene nanoflakes , epitaxially grown on ir(111 ) and intercalated with oxygen , are reported to exhibit a linear spectrum [ ] . despite these promising proceedings with graphene - based qds , pauli blockade  a basic step towards spintronics [ ] and already achieved in carbon nanotubes [ ]  has ( to our knowledge ) not been observed in graphene , yet .",

    "[ gnf ] , rely on precise edges .",
    "atomically accurate armchair gnrs can be produced bottom - up , with widths up to @xmath216 , from aromatic precursor molecules [ ] or top - down .",
    "one top - down technique that leads to precise edges is the unzipping of carbon nanotubes with an abruptly expanding nitrogen gas inside the nanotubes [ ] .",
    "another possibility is the electron - beam induced mechanical rupture of bulk graphene [ ] .",
    "the latter method can be used to produce armchair edges as well as zigzag edges and can be applied in high vacuum , thus leading to minimally contaminated samples . beyond this , clean structuring methods for graphene include nano - etching of suspended graphene [ ] and the use of a silicon atom as a monatomic chisel [ ] .",
    "we have given an overview of spintronics with electron spin states in graphene quantum dots and nanoflakes .",
    "long coherence times can be expected because of weak sources of decoherence , i.e. , small coupling strengths of the spin - orbit and hyperfine interactions , and a marginal abundance of nuclear spins in carbon . we have explained spin relaxation via spin - orbit mediated coupling to acoustic phonons and we have introduced a generic formula for the spin relaxation time @xmath0 for graphene and other systems .",
    "valley degeneracy and the lack of a bandgap in bulk graphene pose challenges to spin operations in graphene quantum dots .",
    "specific systems where these challenges can be overcome have been reviewed and , if applicable , studies on their spin relaxation times have been discussed .",
    "magnetism can be induced in graphene by several means . here , we have focused on magnetism in graphene nanoflakes and _ in - situ _ tunability of antiferromagnetism in symmetric nanoflakes with defects .",
    "we have summarized studies on the interaction of electron and nuclear spins and finally , we have pointed out recent experimental achievements relevant for spintronics with graphene quantum dots .",
    "we believe that graphene has the potential for a top - notch spintronics material that can outperform established materials like silicon or gaas for specific applications .",
    "the observation of the pauli blockade represents a fundamental step towards spintronics with graphene quantum dots . in principle , the necessary architectures exist already but suffer from poor tunability of the source and drain barriers and inefficient spin injection .",
    "similarly , the components required for electrostatic confinement of electrons in armchair gnr quantum dots are already available but have not been integrated into one device , yet . with view to the rapid progress of device fabrication ,",
    "we anticipate significant progress in these fields within the next 2 - 3 years .",
    "ultimately , we see spintronics in graphene as a building block for 2d - heterostructured spintronics devices composed of ( functionalized ) graphene and other 2d materials like tmdcs and hbn .",
