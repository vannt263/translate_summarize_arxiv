    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) will complete a homogeneous catalogue of @xmath1 qsos even extending @xmath2 ; in fact , the highest-@xmath3 qso as of this writing ( sdssp j033829.31 + 002156.3 at @xmath4 ) was discovered from the sdss commissioning data ( fan et al .",
    "haiman & loeb ( 1999 ) predict that the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ will detect @xmath5 qsos at @xmath2 per its @xmath6 field of view",
    ".    those datasets will necessarily and significantly change the way of research of the clustering of objects at high redshifts . due to the statistical limitation of existing catalogues of qsos",
    ", it has been common to infer its clustering amplitude and evolution in a model - dependent and indirect manner ( but see , e.g. , la franca , andreani , & cristiani 1998 ) ; an interesting example of this methodology is the use of the fluctuation in the x - ray background ( e.g. , lahav , piran , & treyer 1997 ; treyer et al .",
    "1998 ) . in near future ,",
    "however , one can analyze the qsos redshift catalogues in order to detect the clustering at @xmath7 as is routinely repeated for the existing galaxy redshift samples at @xmath8 .",
    "in extracting the cosmological information from such catalogues of objects at high redshifts , there are several observational `` contaminations '' that one has to keep in mind , including    linear redshift - space ( velocity ) distortion : : :    in linear theory of gravitational evolution of fluctuations , any    density fluctuations induce the corresponding peculiar velocity field ,    which results in the systematic distortion of the pattern of    distribution of objects in redshift space .",
    "the analytical expression    for the linear distortion was first given by kaiser ( 1987 ) and then    later elaborated by a number of people ( see hamilton 1998 for an    excellent review ) .",
    "nonlinear redshift - space ( velocity ) distortion : : :    virialized nonlinear objects have an isotropic and large velocity    dispersion .",
    "this _ finger - of - god _ effect significantly suppresses the    observed amplitude of correlation on small scales ( davis & peebles    1983 ; suto & suginohara 1991 ) . an empirical expression for this effect    in the power spectrum",
    "was discussed by peacock & dodds ( 1994 , 1996 ;    pd ) and cole , fisher , & weinberg ( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "cosmological redshift - space ( geometry ) distortion : : :    while the geometry of the local universe is well approximated as    euclidean , the global structure of the universe should be properly    described by a general relativistic model",
    ". in particular , the comoving    separation of a pair of objects at @xmath9 is not    determined only by their observable angular and redshift separations    ( @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) without    specifying the geometry , or equivalently the matter content , of the    universe ( i.e. , the cosmological density parameter    @xmath12 , and the dimensionless cosmological constant    @xmath13 ) .",
    "this generates a nontrivial anisotropy in    the clustering pattern of objects , particularly at    @xmath14    ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ; matsubara & suto 1996 ; ballinger , peacock , &    heavens 1996 ; popowski et al .",
    "cosmological light - cone effect : : :    all cosmological observations are carried out on a light - cone , the    null hypersurface of an observer at @xmath15 , and not on any    constant - time hypersurface . thus clustering amplitude and shape of    objects should naturally evolve even _ within _ the survey volume of a    given observational catalogue . unless restricting the objects at a    narrow bin of @xmath3 at the expense of the statistical    significance , the proper understanding of the data requires a    theoretical model to take account of the average over the light cone    which has been extensively discussed by our group ( nakamura ,    matsubara , & suto 1998 ; matsubara , suto , & szapudi 1997 ; yamamoto &    suto 1999 ; nishioka & yamamoto 1999 ; suto et al . 1999a ; yamamoto ,    nishioka , & suto 1999 ) and others ( e.g. , mataresse et al .",

    "bias : : :    the final difficulty in relating the clustering of any species of    astronomical objects to that of mass fluctuations is the biasing    ( kaiser 1984 ) . while the first three are purely dynamical ( or    gravitational ) effects , the biasing of luminous objects relative to    mass should result from a complicated and delicate competition of a    variety of astrophysical processes , which is almost impossible to    describe from the first principle .",
    "therefore a parametric description    of the biasing on the basis of simple assumptions is useful at this    point in understanding the generic features of the possible effects    ( e.g. , bardeen et al .",

    "the first two effects are already important in any shallow surveys of objects at @xmath16 ( see e.g. , hatton & cole 1998 ) , and the last three effects become progressively important as the survey becomes deeper .",
    "while one of the primary scientific goals for the cosmological surveys is a proper understanding of the clustering evolution of luminous objects at high redshifts , one can probe the geometry of the universe combining the standard theory of structure formation .",
    "this is what we will explore in the present paper . our previous work ( suto et al .",
    "1999a ) examined the two - point correlation function in cosmological redshift space , and found that the nonlinear peculiar velocity field , or _",
    "finger - of - god _ , can not be neglected even on fairly large scales .",
    "thus here we focus on the power spectrum , which is easier to describe the nonlinear effects theoretically ( pd ; ballinger et al .",
    "we focus on the mass power spectrum and do not consider the biasing explicitly below , while the same methodology is applicable if the bias is linear and scale - independent . in reality , however , the bias , especially for galaxies and quasars , may be too complicated to be analytically tractable ( i.e. , dekel & lahav 1999 ; taruya , koyama , & soda 1999 ) .",
    "this issue will be studied in detail and described elsewhere ( magira , jing , taruya , & suto 1999 ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we describe a theoretical modeling of the power spectrum of _ dark matter _ including the cosmological redshift - space distortion in addition to the linear and nonlinear velocity distortions (  2 ) . the theoretical model prediction is checked and calibrated against the n - body simulations .",
    "next we examine the feasibility of estimating cosmological parameters by analyzing the anisotropy in the monopole and quadrupole moments of power spectra of objects at high redshifts with the sdss qso sample specifically in mind (  [ sec : feasibility ] ) .",
    "finally  4 is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "the power spectrum distorted by the peculiar velocity field ( neglecting the cosmological distortion for the moment ) , @xmath17 , is known to be well approximated by the following expression ( peacock & dodds 1994 ; cole et al .",
    "1995 ) : @xmath18 ^ 2 d\\left[k_\\parallel{{\\hbox { $ \\sigma_{\\scriptscriptstyle { \\rm p}}$}}}(z)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the comoving wavenumber perpendicular and parallel to the line - of - sight of an observer , and @xmath21 is the power spectrum in real space .",
    "the second factor in the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : power_in_redshiftspace ] ) represents the linear redshift - space distortion derived by kaiser ( 1987 ) adopting the distant - observer approximation and the scale - independent linear bias , @xmath22 .",

    "it has been often assumed that @xmath28 is exponential with a scale - independent pairwise velocity dispersion , @xmath29 . while this exponential function has been adopted in the literature ( cole et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ; pd ; ballinger et al .",
    "1996 ) , its _ predictability _ was not fully checked against the n - body simulations ; the previous studies used the value of @xmath29 determined _ a priori _ from the simulation data themselves . in reality , however , the formula is useful for the present purpose only if @xmath30 can be computed from a given @xmath21 and a set of cosmological parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . in next subsections , we will show that @xmath33 combined with the existing fitting formulae for nonlinear density and velocity fields is in excellent agreement with the results of our high - resolution n - body simulations .      in order to quantify various effects of redshift - space distortion and to examine the validity of theoretical predictions , we use a series of high - resolution n - body simulations by jing & suto ( 1998 ) .",
    "the simulations assume representative cosmological models in cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogonies ( table [ tab : modelparam ] ) .",
    "each model has three different realizations , and employs @xmath34 dark matter particles in the periodic comoving cube of the boxsize @xmath35mpc .",

    "figure [ fig : pwrelvr ] plots the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution function at @xmath15 and @xmath42 in three different models .",
    "different symbols correspond to the results for different comoving separations . as simple analytical models for @xmath28",
    ", we consider an exponential : @xmath43 and a gaussian : @xmath44 the former is suggested to be a good approximation on nonlinear scales both observationally ( davis & peebles 1983 ) and theoretically ( efstathiou et al . 1988 ; ueda , itoh , & suto 1993 ; suto 1993 ; seto & yokoyama 1998 ; juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the latter should be the case if the underlying density field is purely random - gaussian .",
    "solid lines in figure [ fig : pwrelvr ] represent the best - fit exponential distribution for results at @xmath45 , treating @xmath29 as a free parameter .",
    "the corresponding best - fit values are listed in table [ tab : fitparam ] .",
    "figure [ fig : pwrelvr ] indicates that neither exponential nor gaussian function fits the numerical results completely .",
    "thus it is reasonable that the best - fit values in table [ tab : fitparam ] are somewhat different from the pairwise dispersions , @xmath46 , directly evaluated from the n - body data . dashed and dotted lines represent the exponential and gaussian curves , respectively , both of which adopt @xmath46 as the velocity dispersion @xmath29 .    with this result in mind ,",
    "however , we would still like to adopt the above distribution functions mainly for simplicity and definiteness .",
    "in fact we will show that this procedure is accurate enough for our present purpose .",
    "thus the remaining task is to predict @xmath29 given a set of cosmological model parameters . in a previous paper ( suto et al .",
    "1999a ) , we find that a fitting formula by mo , jing , & brner ( 1997 ; mjb hereafter ) is in excellent agreement with our numerical results .",

    "figure [ fig : p2ovp0comb ] displays the predictions for the quadrupole to monopole ratio . in principle",
    "this statistics is superior either to the monopole or to the quadrupole in the sense that it is independent of the overall normalization of the power spectrum ( e.g. , cole et al .",
    "1995 ) ; in fact the ratio becomes constant , @xmath100 , in linear regime ( i.e. , without finger of god and geometrical effects ) , which is plotted in dashed lines in the figure . on the other hand",
    ", the ratio lies between @xmath101 and the practical usefulness crucially depends both on the data quality and the accuracy of the theoretical predictions ( see  3 below ) .",
    "incidentally the simulation results seem to disagree with the predictions at @xmath15 , but this is mainly because the predictions adopt the exponential damping function although the gaussian is more appropriate for simulation results at @xmath15 ( see also figures [ fig : p0combcdf ] and [ fig : p2combcdf ] ) .    in order to understand the model - dependence of the moments ,",
    "we show the extent to which it is sensitive to the assumed velocity dispersions @xmath29 in figure [ fig : p0combcsp ] for @xmath102 , and to a set of parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath36 ) in figures [ fig : p0cosmo ] , [ fig : p2cosmo ] and [ fig : p2ovp0cosmo ] for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : p0combcsp ] implies that the predictions on scales @xmath105 are very accurate and not sensitive to the adopted @xmath29 .",
    "thus the usefulness of our proposed cosmological test is crucially dependent on the observational data quality on the quasi - linear scales which are presumably achievable only with the upcoming sdss qso surveys .",
    "it should be noted that there is a small but clear systematic difference between @xmath106 and @xmath97 in figures [ fig : p0combcdf ] to [ fig : p0combcsp ] , despite the fact that we subtracted the shot noise due to the finite number of sampled particles .",
    "actually we were not able to understand the origin of this effect , but the effect is smaller than the other uncertainties involved in the present analysis .",
    "incidentally figure [ fig : p0cosmo ] indicates that the behavior of @xmath102 is degenerate for a certain set of the parameters since its shape and amplitude are sensitive both to @xmath12 and @xmath13 through the correction factors , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and to @xmath36 through the shape of the power spectrum in real space .",
    "such a degeneracy on the density parameter is apparent for open models of @xmath109 and for flat models of @xmath110 .",
    "fortunately , as shown by figure [ fig : p2cosmo ] , a measurement of the quadrupole @xmath103 may help break the degeneracy especially for the density parameter as low as @xmath111 . combining other cosmological tests , such as the cosmic microwave background , clustering statistics , cluster abundances , etc .",
    "may further narrow the space of the cosmological parameters . in the next section",
    "we will investigate the feasibility of measuring the cosmological parameters by combining the first two moments of the red - shift power spectrum from a survey like the sloan qso survey and the cluster abundance .",
    "in the previous section we have demonstrated that the theoretical predictions for @xmath112 and @xmath113 are quite accurate for @xmath114mpc@xmath69 .",
    "thus we finally examine if the cosmological test using these moments leads to any useful constraints on the cosmological parameters . for this purpose ,",
    "we use the results from the n - body simulation models ( table [ tab : modelparam ] ) at @xmath42 , and perform the statistical analyses as follows .",
    "our theoretical model is specified by a set of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath31 , and @xmath37 .",
    "since the results of our n - body simulations are scalable with respect to @xmath37 , we assume that @xmath37 is related to the shape of the spectrum through the relation , @xmath115 , neglecting the baryon contribution @xmath116 ( sugiyama 1995 ) for simplicity . in order to take account of the statistical limitation",
    ", we do not use the entire simulation particles , but randomly select particles . for a given number of selected particles , we generate 24 mock samples ( 8 randomly selected subsamples for each realization ) for each cosmological model .",
    "then we assign the errors to the simulation data from the ensemble average over the 24 samples . in order to avoid the strongly nonlinear effect",
    ", we use the spectrum in the range @xmath114mpc@xmath69 , and perform the @xmath117-analysis .    figures [ fig : chi2p0p2os8 ] and [ fig : chi2p0p2ol ] display the confidence level contours from the @xmath117-analysis of @xmath112 or @xmath113 on @xmath12@xmath31 and @xmath12@xmath13 planes , respectively . to be specific , we compute the @xmath117 defined by @xmath118 ^ 2 , \\ ] ] where the wavenumber is sampled between @xmath119mpc@xmath120mpc@xmath69 as @xmath121 the indices @xmath122 and @xmath123 denote the three different realizations and eight randomly selected subsamples for each cosmological model , and in evaluating equation ( [ eq : chi2def ] ) we randomly choose one mock sample from 24 ( @xmath124 ) simulated mock samples in total . for @xmath125 , we use the dispersion among 24 mock samples assuming that this corresponds to a cosmic variance : @xmath126 ^ 2 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting confidence level is computed from the reduced @xmath117 for eight degrees of freedom , i.e. , ten data points _ minus _ two free parameters , either , @xmath127 or @xmath128 . we perform the above analysis for the monopole and the quadrupole , separately , and also combine the monopole and quadrupole analysis .",
    "we have adopted the @xmath117 technique to quantify the errors for the measured parameters because it is simple , but perhaps other statistical methods , e.g. , the maximum likelihood , may better quantify the measurement errors in the actual application to the future observational data .",
    "figures [ fig : chi2p0p2os8]a , [ fig : chi2p0p2os8]c , [ fig : chi2p0p2ol]a , and [ fig : chi2p0p2ol]c assume that @xmath129 , while other panels in these two figures treat @xmath36 as an independent parameter and fix the value as specified by the simulation ( table [ tab : modelparam ] ) .",
    "we display the results for @xmath130 ( bottom panels ) , @xmath97 ( middle panels ) , and @xmath131 ( top panels ) from the entire @xmath132 particles at @xmath42 . for reference ,",
    "the quasar luminosity function of boyle , shanks , & peterson ( 1988 ) predicts that the number of quasars per @xmath133 steradian brighter than 19 magnitude in b is about 4500 either in @xmath134 or in @xmath135 ( for the @xmath136 and @xmath137 model ) .",
    "if we use the extrapolation of the luminosity function to @xmath7 by wallington & narayan ( 1993 ) , the total number of @xmath1 qsos @xmath138 are expected to be cataloged in the upcoming sdss qso sample .",
    "it should be noted that the best - fit parameters in those figures are sometimes a bit different from the true values that we use in the simulations .",
    "this is simply because the figures represent results for one particular mock sample .",
    "we made sure that the best - fit values are in good agreement with the true values if we replace @xmath139 in equation ( [ eq : chi2def ] ) by @xmath140 .",
    "we repeat the analysis in figure [ fig : chi2p0p2os8 ] by fixing either @xmath137 or @xmath141 . as anticipated",
    ", the present analyses with either @xmath102 or @xmath103 alone do not determine the cosmological parameters completely .",
    "however , the error contours of the monopole do not align with those of the quadrupole completely ; in some cases the contours of the monopole and the quadrupole are somewhat orthogonal , though the error contours of the quadrupole are generally larger than those of the monopole .",
    "these results indicate that a combination of the first two moments can more stringently , as expected , constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "figures [ fig : chi2p02os8 ] show the confidence levels of such a joint constraint on @xmath142 .",
    "an encouraging feature noted from this figure is that the flat and open universes with @xmath143 can be well separated with this test if the number of the objects @xmath144 .",
    "nevertheless the combination with another cosmological test can easily yield an interesting constraint in the parameter space .",
    "this is illustrated in the middle panels of figures [ fig : chi2p0p2os8 ] and [ fig : chi2p02os8 ] where the constraints from the x - ray cluster abundance ( kitayama & suto 1997 ) : @xmath145 are overlaid .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath146 determined from the observed cluster abundance is 0.54 .    combining the cluster abundance with the test of this paper",
    "may determine the cosmological parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : chi2p0p2ol ] .",
    "the normalization @xmath31 adopted in our simulations are slightly different from the value given by eq.([eq : s8o0 ] ) .",
    "thus in the analysis presented in figures [ fig : chi2p0p2ol ] and [ fig : chi2p02ol ] , we accordingly change the normalization factor @xmath146 with keeping the same @xmath12 dependence , and find the minimal @xmath117 by allowing the @xmath147 dispersion .",
    "our adopted value of @xmath146 for each model is summarized in table [ tab : modelparam ] .",
    "the monopole moment is sensitive to the density parameter @xmath12 only , while the quadrupole measurement interestingly complements to the monopole measurement in that it depends more strongly on the cosmological constant .",
    "combining these two moments results in a joint constraint on @xmath148 which is shown in [ fig : chi2p02ol ] .",
    "consistent with the results shown in figure [ fig : chi2p02os8 ] , the open and flat universes with @xmath149 can be discriminated with the number of objects larger than @xmath150 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that our constraints in figure [ fig : chi2p02ol ] are fairly orthogonal to those from the sn ia ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) , and can be even combined to probe the cosmic equation of state in general ( e.g. , garnavich et al . 1998 ) .",
    "finally we repeat the similar analysis for the quadrupole to monopole ratio , the results of which are plotted in figure [ fig : chi2p2ovp0ol ] . as anticipated the resulting constraints are more sensitive to @xmath13 compared to those presented in figures [ fig : chi2p02ol ] . on the other hand",
    ", we realize that our current modeling may not be sufficiently good to describe the ratio in practice ; note that while the amplitudes of the monopole and the quadrupole span two orders of magnitudes , their ratio is merely around between @xmath151 and 1 , and thus the accurate modeling and good data qualities are required for the robust estimation of the cosmological parameters .",
    "this is why some panels in figure [ fig : chi2p2ovp0ol ] do not have any contours with reasonable confidence levels .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the reliability and accuracy of the theoretical modeling for the power spectrum in cosmological redshift space using the high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "our main conclusion is that the cosmological test proposed by ballinger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and matsubara & suto ( 1996 ) is in fact practically useful in constraining the cosmological parameters combined with the upcoming sdss qso sample . while an application of this methodology to the lyman - break galaxies is also interesting , the small number of total objects and cosmic variance seem to be the major difficulties in practice ( nair 1999 ) .",
    "the results are admittedly complicated since many different and important contaminations are necessarily involved . in particular , our methodology is heavily dependent on the underlying mass power spectrum , which may be reconstructed from the redshift - space observation but with large uncertainties .",
    "thus we explicitly assume that the spectrum is completely specified by four free parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath36 and @xmath31 , as in the case of cdm models . more importantly and realistically , any model for bias should add at least another free parameter ( even in a time - independent and scale - invariant linear model which is too idealistic ) . as a result , the estimated parameters are inevitably model - dependent . therefore in order to extract useful cosmological information",
    ", we have to combine the additional constraints on those parameters from independent cosmological consideration .",
    "even so , the present model is a minimal requirement to understand the clustering of high - redshift objects properly .    the remaining important problems to improve this cosmological test include the higher - order moment analysis , the biasing and the light - cone effects ; first",
    ", we have shown that the anisotropy of the power spectrum in cosmological redshift space shows up already in the monopole and quadrupole moments , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "on the other hand , this is why the resulting constraints are only weakly dependent on @xmath13 , unlike the original idea by alcock & paczyski ( 1979 ) ; note , however , that ballinger et al . (",
    "1996 ) correctly recognized this difficulty .",
    "utilizing the higher - order moments will be another possibility , although the data will be necessarily noisier .",
    "second , our analysis presented above implicitly assumes to apply for the data in a narrow redshift bin . in order to increase the number of available pairs , and thus the statistical significance ,",
    "it is crucial to take account of the cosmological light - cone effect properly in theoretical predictions following yamamoto & suto ( 1999 ) , yamamoto , nishioka , & suto ( 1999 ) and suto et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "finally , we did not allow for the possible biasing which should further complicate the mapping of the clustering statistics of the luminous objects to that of the underlying mass distribution .",
    "these issues will be discussed elsewhere ( magira , jing , taruya , & suto 1999 ) .",
