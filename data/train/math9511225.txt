    "two of the basic problems in the theory of packing and covering are to determine the most efficient packing and covering with replicas of ( meaning sets congruent to ) a given set @xmath1 in some metric space .",
    "recall that a packing is a family of sets whose interiors are mutually disjoint , and that a covering is a family of sets whose union is the whole space . by a space we mean either @xmath6-dimensional euclidean space @xmath9 or @xmath6-dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath10 , although the definitions that follow are sometimes more general . we shall consider packings and coverings with replicas of a nonempty compact connected set which is the closure of its interior , a _ body _ , for short .",
    "the usual measure of the efficiency of an arrangement in euclidean space is density . roughly speaking ,",
    "the density of an arrangement is the total volume of the members of the arrangement divided by the volume of the whole space .",

    "the maximum density of a packing of the space with replicas of a ( measurable ) set @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath11 and is called the _ packing density of _ @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum density of a covering with replicas of @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath12 and is called the _ covering density of _ @xmath1 .",
    "it is known that each of the maximum and the minimum density is attained @xcite .",
    "there are some disadvantages of using density for measuring the efficiency of an arrangement . in the first place ,",
    "optimum density is a global notion and it does not imply the local efficiency of an arrangement .",
    "secondly , the notion of density can not be extended in full generality to hyperbolic geometry @xcite , @xcite . in what follows",
    "we introduce and study certain notions which might serve as substitutes for maximum density packings and minimum density coverings .",

    "a more precise argument follows .",
    "temporarily fix @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and suppose that , to the contrary , the set @xmath48 of points @xmath49 such that @xmath13 is less than @xmath30 away from unsaturated in @xmath19 has measure at least @xmath50 .",
    "we will arrive at a contradiction for @xmath30 sufficiently small and @xmath42 sufficiently large .",
    "since @xmath48 has measure @xmath51 , it can not be covered by fewer than @xmath52 balls of radius @xmath53 .",
    "it follows that there exists a packing @xmath54 of @xmath55 balls of radius @xmath20 entirely within @xmath56 such that the restriction of @xmath13 to each ball is less than @xmath30 away from an unsaturated packing , where @xmath57 for some constant @xmath18 depending only on @xmath20 and @xmath45 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath58    let @xmath59 let @xmath60 and let @xmath30 be given by lemma  [ lhausdorff ] .",
    "observe that the difference between the density of @xmath13 and that of the homothetic thinning @xmath32 ( both relative to @xmath39 ) is at most @xmath61 . on the other hand , since @xmath32 is unsaturated in each of the balls @xmath62 , the density of @xmath32 relative to @xmath39 can be increased through saturation by an amount greater than @xmath63 ( note that by our choice of @xmath41 , each @xmath62 is contained in @xmath38 . ) by our choice of @xmath41 , we have @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the thinned and then re - saturated packing is denser in @xmath38 than the original packing @xmath13 , which is a contradiction .",

    "the packing @xmath78 is @xmath79 away from unsaturated in @xmath80 for every @xmath81 , and it is therefore completely saturated in @xmath9 .",
    "the argument for the analogous theorem for coverings requires two minor modifications in the formulation and proof of lemma  [ lprobability ] .",
    "firstly , instead of using a covering which extremizes density in @xmath38 , we use a minimum cardinality arrangement of replicas of @xmath1 that covers @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , an optimal covering of @xmath38 in this sense has no replicas disjoint from @xmath38 .",
    "secondly , a homothetic thickening of a covering of @xmath38 by a factor of @xmath82 is not in general again a covering . to repair it ,",
    "we identify a cube @xmath83 and we cover the annular region @xmath84 by non - overlapping translates of @xmath85 .",
    "the resulting gain in number of replicas due to homothetic thickening is comparable to the loss of density due to homothetic thinning .",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath1 is convex can be weakened somewhat without any changes in the proof .",
    "it suffices that @xmath1 have the _ strict nested similarity property _ , which requires that , for every positive number @xmath27 , the interior of @xmath1 contains a replica of @xmath86 .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is _ strictly starlike _ , i.e. , @xmath1 contains an interior point such that every ray emanating from it meets the boundary of @xmath1 at a single point , then @xmath1 has the strict nested similarity property .",
    "another example of a body with the strict nested similarity property is an @xmath41-neighborhood of a logarithmic spiral , as shown in figure  [ figure4 ] .",
    "we recall a construction from the topological theory of covering spaces , to be used in this section and in the next one , which we apply to produce @xmath2-saturated packings and @xmath2-reduced coverings in various spaces . for the basic notions and facts related to that theory we refer the reader to (",
