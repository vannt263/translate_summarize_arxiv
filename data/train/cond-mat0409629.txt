    "each landau level is highly degenerate , with the number of states equal to the number of magnetic flux quanta passing through the system .",
    "if the field and corresponding degeneracy is sufficiently large , the low - energy physics of the system may then be dominated by electrons in the highest partially occupied ( @xmath7th ) landau level , with the other electrons essentially renormalizing the effective coulomb interaction in this level @xcite . in this situation ,",
    "the kinetic energy is quenched and the system arranges itself in order to minimize the interactions .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation @xcite predicts the formation of cdw ground states for @xmath1 .",
    "these cdws evolve from wigner crystals to bubble states  @xcite as the partial landau - level filling factor @xmath8 increases . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the bubble states give way to stripe states ( also called unidirectional cdws . )",
    "this hartree - fock result is corroborated by density matrix renormalization group calculations @xcite and exact diagonalization studies @xcite .",
    "dc transport experiments indeed observe highly anisotropic , and apparently metallic , conductivity stripesexpr near half - filling of higher landau levels ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is likely due to the formation of stripe states .",
    "because the stripe state breaks translational symmetry in only one direction , it has the symmetry of a smectic liquid crystal @xcite , and as in that system supports a set of gapless phonon modes @xcite .",
    "these modes are present because the stripe state lacks any restoring force when a single stripe slides with respect to the others . in the context of an electron system",
    ", the smectic state can be thought of as a self - organized array of luttinger liquids fradkin , edgestatemodel , a state of fermions that does not obey landau fermi liquid theory and ( so far ) is known to exist only in one dimension @xcite .",
    "one way of viewing the luttinger liquid is in terms of a one dimensional crystal that has lost long - range order due to quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this idea is easily generalized to the case of stripes @xcite , and suggests that the low - energy degrees of freedom for the system may be described in terms of a displacement field",
    ". this will be the basic language for our study .",
    "it has long been recognized that disorder can pin a cdw and render it insulating @xcite .",
    "( similarly , luttinger liquids may be pinned by impurities in spite of their liquid - like correlations @xcite . ) in this situation , the real part of the zero wavevector , finite - frequency conductivity @xmath10 vanishes as @xmath11 , and has a resonance at higher @xmath12 with a peak ( or pinning ) frequency and width that are determined by the effective restoring force due to the disorder @xcite .",
    "such behavior has indeed been observed in high landau levels for @xmath8 sufficiently far away from 1/2 so that one expects the electrons to be organized into bubble statesmuwave .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased , there is a general trend for the pinning frequency to decrease , eventually becoming lost in the noise as the filling factor approaches the value at which the dc conductivity becomes anisotropic and metallic @xcite .",
    "experiments to better resolve the dynamical conductivity as the stripe phase is entered are currently underway @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question that arises in this context is whether the apparent metallic behavior seen in dc transport experiments represents the true zero temperature behavior in the stripe state .",
    "while current data suggests the diagonal conductivities @xmath13 and @xmath14 saturate to finite values at low temperatures , presumably such experiments can answer this fundamental question unambiguously only by reaching significantly lower temperatures than are currently available .",
    "the possibility that near half - filling the stripes may not be fully pinned is extremely intriguing because , if this is indeed the case , then the electrons have avoided becoming localized and the resulting anisotropic metal can not be a fermi liquid .",
    "thus this state could well be a higher dimensional analogue of a luttinger liquid . developing and understanding the results of experiments beyond dc transport  such as measurements of the dynamical conductivity @xcite",
    " then take on an additional significance .",
    "one possible route to metallic behavior for the stripe system could be via a depinning transition . in principle",
    "this could happen in a one dimensional luttinger liquid , if one could continuously tune the interactions from repulsive to attractive @xcite . because the stripe system has a larger parameter space needed to describe its elastic properties than the single stiffness that describes a one - dimensional solid ( specifically , one needs to estimate the dynamical matrix along a line in the brillouin zone , as we discuss below ) , it is possible to arrive at this depinning transition even when the bare interaction parameters among the electrons are purely repulsive @xcite .",
    "the question of whether stripes may become depinned must be answered via a detailed calculation of the stripe elasticity , and depending on how one estimates this , different answers are possible @xcite , as we discuss in more detail below .    in what follows",
    ", we will adopt an approach that models the quantum hall ( qh ) stripe system as an array of one dimensional , quantum disordered solids as shown in fig .",
    "[ stripeselastic ] .",
    "we estimate the dynamical matrix of this system by matching the elastic theory to the results of a microscopic calculation within the time - dependent hartree - fock approximation ( tdhfa ) .",
    "this approach was taken by some of us @xcite in a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) calculation , which demonstrated that a quantum depinning transition can occur as @xmath15 from below , with the critical partial filling @xmath16 depending on the details of the system : landau level index , layer thickness , disorder strength , etc .",

    ", we provide details of the calculations as well as some further results .    our general approach to this problem is to use replicas @xcite and the gaussian variational method ( gvm ) , as was first introduced by mzard and parisi for elastic manifolds @xcite and then further developed by giamarchi and le doussal and their coworkers in applications to a variety of condensed matter systems @xcite . in the qh systems , this method was used by chitra _",
    "@xcite for pinned wigner crystals in the @xmath17 landau level , and by orignac and chitra @xcite for stripes , in the latter case using a different set of approximations than us and yielding very different results than those described below .",
    "because of the strong fluctuations inherent in the depinning transition , we have found that one can not correctly solve for the dynamical conductivity using the semiclassical approximation  to the saddle point equations ( spe s ) , which we review below , that has given this approach its attractive simplicity . by relaxing this approximation",
    "we will see that in the depinned state the dynamical conductivity can have a surprising power - law frequency dependence , and a discontinuous behavior at the transition that is analogous to the universal stiffness jump that occurs at a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , we will see that the solution to the spe s that yield this behavior have an unusual structure involving breaking the replica symmetry for motion perpendicular to the stripes , while preserving it parallel to the stripes .",
    "this _ partial replica symmetry breaking _ ( prsb ) indicates that the stripes may be pinned for perpendicular motion while free to slide relative to one another .",
    "this qualitative behavior was anticipated by the perturbative rg study yfc .    as discussed above , when the system is pinned there are resonant peaks which appear in @xmath13 and @xmath18 .",
