    "our starting point is figure  [ fig : colliding - walls ] , left , ( figure  21 from @xcite ) explaining why at @xmath27 a hypergraph obtained from the antipodal relation in @xmath24cells self - intersects . the principal reason for the self - intersection to appear is the sharp turn that the hypergraph makes in the union @xmath33 of the two @xmath24cells @xmath34 on the left . as @xmath10 approaches @xmath28 , the possible length @xmath35 of the common path @xmath36 approaches @xmath37 . hence the distance in @xmath38 between the endpoints of a hypergraph segment tends to @xmath39 , see figure  [ fig : colliding - walls ] , right .",
    "this is bad , since can easily be turned into a self - intersection by adding a third @xmath24cell to @xmath33 as in figure  [ fig : colliding - walls ] , left .    to remedy this , whenever @xmath40 we replace the antipodal relation in one of the two @xmath24cells of @xmath33 , say in @xmath41 , by the relation @xmath42 described in figure  2",
    "specifically , we consider two subpaths @xmath43 of @xmath44 of length @xmath45 containing the endpoints of @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the symmetry of @xmath47 exchanging its endpoints .",
    "if @xmath48 are antipodal edge midpoints of @xmath41 and @xmath49 lies in the interior of @xmath47 , then we put @xmath50 , otherwise let @xmath51 .",
    "this relation has the following advantage over the antipodal one .",
    "let @xmath52 be in the same hypergraph of @xmath33 .",
    "we claim that the distance between @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath38 is bounded below by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of @xmath24cells in @xmath33 .",
    "this value will be called the _ balance _ of @xmath33 , and is bounded from above by @xmath57 .",
    "notice that for @xmath58 it is also bounded below by @xmath59 , since @xmath60 .",
    "to justify the claim , there are four cases to consider . if @xmath52 are antipodal in @xmath61 or @xmath41 , there is nothing to prove .",
    "if @xmath52 are both in @xmath41 and @xmath62 , where @xmath49 is antipodal to @xmath53 , then since the distance @xmath63 satisfies @xmath64 , it suffices to use the triangle inequality .",
    "otherwise @xmath65 , and the hypergraph segment @xmath66 crosses @xmath44 in an edge midpoint @xmath49 such that : either @xmath49 is antipodal to both @xmath53 and @xmath54 and lies outside of the interiors of @xmath47 ; or @xmath49 lies in the interior of , say , @xmath67 and is antipodal to @xmath53 in @xmath61 while @xmath68 is antipodal to @xmath54 in @xmath41 . in the first situation @xmath49 is at distance @xmath69 from the endpoints of @xmath44 , so that the distance between @xmath52 is @xmath70 , as desired . in the second situation",
    "the sum of the distances of @xmath71 from an endpoint of @xmath44 is @xmath72 , so that the distance between @xmath52 is @xmath73 , which finishes the proof of the claim .",
    "note that this is the best estimate we can hope for : consider the edge midpoint @xmath74 nearly at the endpoint of @xmath44 and suppose that we attempt to move @xmath75 in @xmath41 , which is the antipode of @xmath68 .",
    "then either we decrease the distance between @xmath54 and @xmath49 or we decrease the distance between @xmath54 and the antipode @xmath53 of @xmath49 in @xmath61 , and both these distances were nearly equal @xmath76 .",
    "we call @xmath33 a _ tile _ and the relation on the edge midpoints of @xmath33 induced by the relations in @xmath61 and @xmath41 a _ balanced tile - wall structure_. we iterate this construction : whenever two tiles , or a tile and a @xmath24cell have large overlap , we change the antipodal relation into one that makes the tile - wall structure balanced",
    ". the tiles in @xmath1 will not share @xmath24cells , except for very particular configurations , and will be used instead of @xmath24cells in van kampen diagrams .",
    "one way to think about this is that since we do not see negative curvature on the original presentation level , we zoom out and look at tiles instead of @xmath24cells , where we are already able to define walls with negative curvature behaviour .",
    "there are two technical problems that one would need to overcome to extend the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] to all densities @xmath4 .",
    "first of all , one needs to understand the combinatorial complication coming from tiles sharing @xmath24cells ( generalisation of assertions ( i)(iii ) in proposition  [ prop : wallconstruction ] ) .",
    "secondly , even for a tile disjoint from all other ones ( as in step  1 of construction  [ constr : main ] ) , but glued of two tiles of size @xmath77 , we do not not know in general how to define a balanced tile - wall structure , i.e.  how to extend part  1 of proposition  [ prop : wallconstruction ] .    * organisation . * in section  [ sec : isoperimetric ]",
    "we discuss the isoperimetric inequality for random groups . in section  [ sec : tiles ] we define tiles , and we equip them with balanced tile - wall structures in section  [ sec : tile - walls ] .",
    "we then show that induced hypergraphs are embedded trees ( section  [ sec : walls ] ) , which are quasi - isometrically embedded ( section  [ sec : quasi - convexity ] ) , and we conclude with the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
