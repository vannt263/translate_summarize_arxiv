    "the presence of additional light scalar degrees of freedom is a common feature of many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "examples include the qcd axion  @xcite , a more general set of axions and axion - like particles  @xcite , majorons  @xcite , familons  @xcite , chameleons  @xcite , branons  @xcite , dilatons , and a variety of other string and geometric moduli  @xcite .",
    "scalars of this sort are typically light due to symmetries of the high - scale theory which prevent them from acquiring masses . as a result , masses for these particles must be generated by dynamical processes at lower scales which break these symmetries  often in conjunction with a cosmological phase transition .",
    "this dynamics also generically leads to a non - trivial time - dependence for the masses of these fields , the details of which can have a significant impact on their late - time energy densities .",
    "understanding these effects is crucial , since such particles can potentially have a variety of phenomenological and cosmological consequences , both helpful and harmful .",
    "indeed , scalars of this sort can contribute to the total abundances of dark matter or dark energy ; induce additional , late periods of reheating after cosmic inflation , potentially resulting in substantially modified cosmologies  @xcite ; prematurely induce matter - domination and/or overclose the universe ; and disrupt the formation of light elements through late decays .",
    "while the detailed dynamics of mass generation can have important consequences even in scenarios involving only a single light scalar , the situation becomes far richer in scenarios involving multiple such fields .",
    "indeed , in cases in which these scalars have the same quantum numbers , the dynamics of mass generation can lead them to experience time - dependent mixing . this mixing in turn leads to a continual redistribution of energy density among the scalars during the mass - generation epoch .",
    "such a redistribution can also have profound effects on the late - time energy densities of these fields , several of which were pointed out in ref .",
    "specifically , even in a theory involving only two scalars , such a redistribution can lead their late time abundances to experience either an enhancement or a suppression , depending on the choice of model parameters .",
    "moreover , in certain regimes , the system may experience a parametric resonance which can have further dramatic effects on these abundances .",
    "finally , the system may also experience a `` re - overdamping '' phenomenon in which its energy density reverts to behaving like vacuum energy at a time after its initial transition from the overdamped to underdamped regime .",
    "a variety of scenarios for new physics predict large numbers of scalar fields with similar quantum numbers . indeed ,",
    "such collections of fields emerge naturally from a variety of string constructions  @xcite , from axiverse considerations  @xcite , and more generally from theories with extra dimensions . of course ,",
    "many features of such theories are highly model - dependent , including the number of fields present , the form of the mass - squared matrix for these fields ( both at very early and at very late times ) , and the time or temperature scales associated with the dynamical mechanisms for mass generation .",
    "however , a given specific new - physics context is likely to lead to certain theoretical structures in which some of these features become fixed .",
    "for example , theories in which a scalar propagates in extra spacetime dimensions give rise to infinite numbers of scalar fields which are organized into kaluza - klein ( kk ) towers in which the form of the mass matrix at early times  even prior to the onset of any mass - generating phase transition  is dictated by the geometry of the compactification manifold . because such kk towers arise generically in scenarios involving compact extra dimensions ( such as string theories , supergravity theories , and many other high - scale unification models ) , the features associated with the cosmological evolution of such kk towers  including the dynamical flow of energy amongst the different kk modes prior to , during , and after cosmological phase transitions  are likely to play an important role in early - universe cosmology .    in this paper",
    "we tackle this important question . in particular",
    ", we study the early - universe cosmology of a kk tower of scalar fields in the presence of a mass - generating phase transition , focusing on the time - development of the total tower energy density ( which determines the relic abundance ) as well as its distribution across the different kk modes . on the one hand",
    ", this study is critical for understanding the cosmological issues associated with extra spacetime dimensions _ per se_. on the other hand , this study also represents an extension of the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that analysis ,",
    "only two scalar fields were considered , but these fields were permitted to experience the most general possible mixings between them . in this analysis , by contrast , the number of scalar fields is infinite but the structure of the kk tower and the interplay between brane and bulk physics imposes a strict mixing structure .",
    "a goal of this paper is therefore to understand the consequences of this simultaneous extension in the number of fields and narrowing of the allowed mixing structure .",
    "as we shall see , studying the dynamics of a complete kk tower can be a significant undertaking due to its infinite number of fields  especially in the presence of a non - trivial , time - dependent , mass - generating and mixing - inducing phase transition .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we shall work towards this goal in distinct stages by starting with only one kk mode and then introducing more and more kk excitations into the system .",
    "ultimately , we shall build towards the full , infinite kk tower . in each case , our goal is to trace the flow of energy through the system and to examine the behavior of such quantities as the total late - time energy density as well as its distribution across the available kk modes .",
    "moreover , our goal is to retain as much generality as possible .",
    "we shall therefore refrain from specifying the exact nature of our kk tower other than to specify that its constituents are scalars .",
    "our results will therefore be broadly applicable to any of the particular scalar fields listed above .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : themodel ] , we begin by establishing the context in which we shall be working and review the general properties of our setup .",

    ", our analysis will extend beyond the usual `` adiabatic '' and `` abrupt '' regimes commonly discussed in the literature . in sect .",
    "[ sec : finitemodenumber ] , we then broaden our perspective by considering the case of only the @xmath0 lowest - lying kk excitations , where @xmath0 is arbitrary but finite . as we shall see , situations with finite @xmath0 have a number of distinct properties which render their cosmological evolution somewhat distinct . in sect .  [ approaching ] ,",
    "we then examine how our system behaves as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath1 , and in sect .",
    "[ sec : kklimit ] we present our results for the full , infinite kk tower .",
    "in order to distinguish this case from the large-@xmath0 case in sect .  [ approaching ] , we shall refer to the kk tower as representing the case with @xmath2 . until this point ,",
    "our analysis is completely general and applicable to any scalar field .",
    "however , in sect .",
    "[ sec : axioninthebulk ] , we then apply our machinery to the case in which our scalar is an axion or axion - like particle .",
    "this allows us to interpret our results within a particular phenomenologically relevant context , and illustrate the significant phenomenological implications that our results can have . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our main conclusions and discuss further potential consequences of our results .    as evident from this outline ,",
    "our method for studying the properties of a full kk theory involves truncating the kk tower to its @xmath0 lowest - lying modes and then considering the @xmath3 limit .",
    "indeed , this is a valid , standard approach .",
    "however , as a by - product of our analysis , we shall discover that such a truncation is not unique .",
    "specifically , we shall develop an alternate `` uv - based '' effective truncation of kk theories which has a number of interesting theoretical properties that distinguish it from the more traditional `` ir - based '' truncation typically used in the extra - dimension literature . both truncations lead to the same physics as @xmath3 , but differ significantly for finite @xmath0 .",
    "this alternate truncation will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ alttrunc ] .",
    "in this section , we establish the framework in which our analysis will take place .",
    "this framework is similar to that considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and is essentially a kk - oriented extension of the framework considered in ref .",
    "specifically , we consider a flat , five - dimensional spacetime geometry of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes our usual four - dimensional minkowski spacetime and where @xmath6 denotes an orbifolded circle ( , a line segment ) of length @xmath7 .",

    "we shall further imagine that our usual standard - model ( sm ) fields and interactions are confined to a four - dimensional brane localized at the orbifold fixed point at @xmath12 .    within this geometry",
    "we consider a five - dimensional scalar field @xmath13 and a corresponding five - dimensional action @xmath14 of the form [ eq:5daction ] s  =   d^4xdx^5 where @xmath15 are fields confined to the sm brane . in general",
    ", our bulk action will contain generic kinetic and mass terms of the form [ eq : generallbulk ] _ bulk ( )  =   _ m^*^m- m^2| |^2  .",

    ", we shall henceforth assume that @xmath18 .",
    "the brane lagrangian @xmath19 , on the other hand , includes the sm lagrangian in addition to interactions between @xmath20 and sm fields . in general",
    ", these interactions can open up decay channels from @xmath20 to sm states .",
    "however , such interactions can also lead an _ effective _ four - dimensional mass for @xmath20 on the brane .",
    "such masses are typically generated as the result of some brane - localized dynamics ( such as a brane - localized phase transition ) which occurs at some time during the cosmological evolution on the brane and which explicitly breaks the shift symmetry .",
    "for this reason , we shall allow our brane lagrangian to include a time - dependent effective brane - mass term of the form [ eq : lbrane ] 1 _ brane ( )  =   - m^2(t ) |",

    "( [ eq : kkequationsofmotion ] ) would decouple .",
    "unfortunately , the time - dependence of @xmath22 leads to a time - dependence for @xmath31 .",
    "this time - dependence induces an unavoidable mixing between the different modes , since even the mass - eigenstate basis is continually changing .",
    "it is this feature which underpins the non - trivial dynamics we shall be studying in this paper .",

    "indeed , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , situations with @xmath45 suffer from an unphysical boundary artifact near @xmath46 , namely the emergence of a `` fake '' mass - generating phase transition whose width tends to decrease as @xmath41 increases beyond @xmath47 .",

    "while in principle many possibilities exist , the existence of the shift symmetry prior to mass generation on the brane suggests that @xmath20 might have an arbitrary fixed displacement at early times , with a fixed non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . upon kk reduction",

    "we shall therefore take these to be the initial conditions for our differential equations ( [ eq : kkequationsofmotion ] ) in what follows .",

    ", the precise value of @xmath57 will not affect our analysis , or any of our conclusions . finally",
    ", we remark that while @xmath59 sets an overall energy scale , this scale will be irrelevant for our purposes since the equations of motion are linear and our main interest will be on relative _ comparisons _ between energy scales rather than their absolute magnitudes .",
    "finally , let us discuss the masses of the individual kk modes in this model . even though our overall brane mass @xmath22 is continually changing in time , diagonalizing the matrix in eq .",

    "[ eq : unmixedmassspectrum ] there are two ways to interpret this result .",

    "this is therefore the main task to which we now turn .",
    "we begin our analysis by focusing on the simplest case : that of only one scalar field , , the case with @xmath86 .",

    "@xcite ) , but only in certain `` adiabatic '' or `` abrupt '' limits . in this section , by contrast , we shall provide a complete mapping of the entire relevant parameter space .    in general , given the equation of motion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kkequationsofmotion ] ) , we see that the field @xmath89 simply follows the trajectory of a damped harmonic oscillator with time - dependent critical damping coefficient .",
    "such an oscillator is overdamped if @xmath90 and only experiences oscillations in the underdamped regime with @xmath91 .",

    "we shall let @xmath94 denote this time at which such coherent oscillations begin .",
    "in general , we know that @xmath94 can not come too much earlier than @xmath33 ( , we can not have @xmath95 ) since our field @xmath96 is presumed massless prior to the onset of the phase transition .",
    "likewise , if @xmath97 occurs long after the phase transition has already occurred ( , if @xmath98 ) , the specific details of the phase transition such as its shape or width will have a negligible effect on the resulting dynamics and on the corresponding energy density @xmath99 .",
    "however , if @xmath100 , the specific properties of the phase transition can be significant .",
    "two approximations are typically used in the literature in order to estimate the effects of the phase transition within this third regime . both rest upon considering extreme limits of the phase - transition width @xmath34 . if the width is large enough so that at all times during the field oscillations ( , at all times after @xmath94 ) , then the field undergoes many oscillations during the phase transition .",
    "this is the so - called _ adiabatic approximation _ : the fields remain virialized during the phase transition and we can approximate the energy density by _",

    "( [ eq : abruptapproximation ] ) , the quantity @xmath103 is measured against the same cosmological clock that measures @xmath33 .",
    "while the approximations above are applicable in two limits of parameter space , it is important to understand the behavior of the late - time energy density over the entire parameter space . in particular , although the mass - generating phase transition generally pumps energy into the system , and although this energy density is ultimately dissipated by the hubble friction that slowly damps the resulting field oscillations , it turns out that there can be an additional source of dissipation and therefore an additional source of suppression of the late - time energy density @xmath104 compared to our usual expectations based on the abrupt approximation .",
    "this arises if the corresponding field is undergoing oscillations _ during _ the phase transition , while the mass of the field is changing appreciably .",
    "0.2 truein     it is easy to identify those regions of parameter space for which this will be the case . in general , there are two criteria that must be satisfied if the scalar field is to undergo at least one oscillation while the mass of the field is changing appreciably .",
    "first , the scalar field must indeed be undergoing oscillations at some point during the phase transition  , our system must be in the underdamped regime before the mass of our field reaches @xmath40 .",
    "we thus must have , or equivalently , where we have taken @xmath33 as a rough benchmark time for the phase transition .",
    "second , in order to ensure that at least one or more field oscillations occur during the interval over which the mass is changing , we require that the timescale associated with the field oscillations be shorter than the phase - transition timescale associated with the changing mass . the former timescale is generally given by @xmath105 and thus decreases throughout the phase transition , ultimately reaching a minimum value @xmath106 , while the latter timescale is nothing but @xmath34 . as a rough benchmark , our phase transition will therefore include at least one oscillation so long as , or equivalently .",
    "combining our two conditions , we thus find that an additional suppression of the late - time energy density compared with what we might expect based on the abrupt approximation will occur as long as our system satisfies the rough benchmark criterion t_g   max , 2  .",

    "finally , at late times , our phase transition leaves our axion - like field with a brane mass given by _ x^2    [ mbarxdefn ] where we have defined the effective four - dimensional @xmath215-breaking scale .",
    "the above setup defines our five - dimensional axion theory .",

    "( [ timetemp ] ) .    in previous sections , we studied the behavior of our general kk system as a function of the four parameters @xmath229 . for our axion theory , by contrast , we see that @xmath230 , and moreover we see that both @xmath227 and @xmath33 are themselves related to the more fundamental parameters @xmath221 and @xmath231 through eqs .",
    "( [ mbarxdefn ] ) and ( [ timetemp ] ) respectively .",
    "thus , we shall henceforth consider our axion theory to be parametrized by @xmath232 .    in four dimensions , the methods used to estimate the late - time abundance of a given axion field typically fall into one of two classes examined in sect .  [ sec : fourdimensionallimit ] : the adiabatic approximation or the abrupt approximation . as we have seen",

    "however , as we have seen in previous sections , these approximations break down in relatively large regions of parameter space .",
    "we should also expect deviations from our standard expectations in the case of an infinite kk tower of axion modes .",
    "for example , the virialization condition that underpins the adiabatic approximation now becomes , and @xmath235 can be much smaller than @xmath236  @xcite .",
    "likewise , there is always some subset of modes in the kk tower for which .",
    "such modes are therefore necessarily affected by the time - dependence of the phase transition .    in this section",
    ", we shall therefore present exact results for the late - time energy densities of our axion fields .",
    "we shall do this both for the four - dimensional @xmath86 case as well as the infinite-@xmath0 case of our full kk axion tower . as discussed above",
    ", we shall take our axion parameter space to be parametrized by @xmath232 .",
    "however , we stress that the plots to be presented in this section are not merely translations of our previous plots into these new variables .",
    "first , we have extended our range of interest within this parameter space into those regions of specific interest for axion physics .",
    "second , we shall now regard @xmath221 and @xmath231 as the fundamental axion parameters relative to which we wish to consider continuous variations .",
    "in other words , we shall plot our the late - time energy densities @xmath134 as functions of @xmath221 and @xmath231 within the @xmath237 plane , choosing only discrete representative choices for @xmath41 .",
    "this too is different than what was done in previous sections , and thus represents a different , independent slice through our four - dimensional parameter space .",
    "we begin , as in sect .",
    "[ sec : fourdimensionallimit ] , by considering the four - dimensional @xmath86 limit . in this case",
    ", we find the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4daxion ] .",
    "we observe from the panels in the left and center columns of fig .",
    "[ fig:4daxion ] that there are distinct regions of parameter space in which the abrupt and adiabatic approximations fail to model the true late - time energy density , with the adiabatic approximation consistently underestimating the true energy density and the abrupt approximation either under- or overestimating the true energy density , in some cases by many orders of magnitude .",
    "we also see that increasing either the confinement scale @xmath221 or the @xmath215 symmetry - breaking scale @xmath231 generally decreases the late - time energy density of our axion field . increasing the width",
    "@xmath41 of our axion - induced phase transition also has the same effect .",
    "indeed , we see from the relatively straight contours in fig .",
    "[ fig:4daxion ] that the absolute magnitude of the late - time energy density scales approximately as _  ~   1/(_g^4 f_x^2 )  , where the constant of proportionality is a non - trivial function of @xmath41 .",
    "this scaling behavior is of course consistent with the analogous result in eq .",
    "( [ 4dscaling ] ) .",
    "finally , we note that all of the contour lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:4daxion ] experience slight `` ripples '' at @xmath238  gev and @xmath239  gev .",
    "these ripples are physical , and correspond to the energy scales @xmath221 at which there are changes in the number @xmath240 of relativistic degrees of freedom ( the former corresponding to the threshold for the charm quark and tau lepton , and the latter corresponding to the threshold for the bottom quark ) .",
    "we now turn to the case in which a full kk tower of axion modes experiences the instanton - induced phase transition . in this case ,",
    "our results are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : kkaxion1 ] through [ fig : kkaxion3 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kkaxion1 ] we have plotted the values of the late - time total energy density @xmath134 of the kk tower relative to our usual benchmarks @xmath204 and @xmath104 . once again , we see that the introduction of a non - zero width @xmath41 for our instanton - induced phase transition leads to either enhancements or suppressions in @xmath134 , depending on the specific region of parameter space .",
    "moreover , we see that increasing @xmath41 only makes these enhancements or suppressions more severe .",
    "by contrast , turning to @xmath241 , we see the introduction of the extra kk modes in the tower only suppresses @xmath134 by an amount that grows _ less _ severe for increasing @xmath41 . in all cases ,",
    "however , these suppressions tend to be more pronounced for smaller @xmath221 and smaller @xmath231 than they are in other regions of parameter space .",
    "it is worth noting that for smaller @xmath221 ( but @xmath242 ) , we see a scaling behavior of the form  ~   f_x_g^2  .",
    "however , as @xmath221 increases ( and thus @xmath33 decreases ) , this scaling behavior eventually breaks down and the behavior of @xmath241 is increasingly determined solely by the behavior of the denominator @xmath104 , with contours of constant @xmath243 .",
    "otherwise , outside the @xmath244 and @xmath245 region , the energy density at late times is very similar to that in the 4d limit .",
    "it is also instructive to compare our kk results for along the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : kkaxion1 ] with the analogous 4d results along the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig:4daxion ] . for the full kk tower ,",
    "we no longer find contours of constant @xmath246 ; instead we find a region exhibiting contours with approximately constant @xmath231 .",
    "likewise , the enhancement region that we found in the 4d limit spanned the entire @xmath247 parameter space for @xmath248 , whereas this region for the kk tower exists only for @xmath249 .",
    "next , we turn to fig .",
    "[ fig : kkaxion2 ] where we plot the absolute magnitude of the total late - time energy density of the kk axion tower in units of @xmath126 . to help understand the features of these plots and how they evolve as a function of @xmath41 , we have included a panel with @xmath179 whose",
    "features can be understood directly via the abrupt approximation . indeed ,",
    "as expected , we see that all @xmath134 contours in the @xmath179 case are contours of either constant @xmath243 , constant @xmath250 , or constant @xmath251 .",

    "[ fig : kkaxion2 ] , we see that all @xmath141 contours for @xmath179 are contours of either constant @xmath243 , constant @xmath250 , or constant @xmath251 , with the subsequent panels once again illustrating how these contours deform as @xmath41 increases . from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : kkaxion3 ] we see that when the phase transition is abrupt , the total energy density of the tower is distributed amongst a significant number of kk modes in the small-@xmath221 , small-@xmath231 corner of parameter space . however , as our mass - generating phase transition unfolds over a longer period of time , the energy contributions from the higher modes are suppressed and @xmath141 begins to fall .    one interesting feature apparent in fig",
    "[ fig : kkaxion3 ] is that the value of @xmath141 is non - monotonic as a function of @xmath221 , first increasing and reaching a maximum near @xmath252  gev before decreasing again .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath141 for @xmath253 is understood from the distribution of initial abundances as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : initialabruptabundance ] .",
    "indeed , in this region , nearly all of the abundance of the kk tower is contributed by the lowest kk mode because very little mixing is generated in the phase transition . by contrast , the decline in @xmath141 which occurs as @xmath221 increases ( or equivalently as @xmath33 decreases ) can be understood as corresponding to our entrance into what in refs .",
    "@xcite was called the `` staggered '' regime wherein the heavier kk modes are oscillating ( and thus already dissipating their energy density ) as soon as our phase transition occurs , whereas the lighter kk modes remain overdamped for a long time after @xmath33 .",
    "this then results in a total abundance composed primarily of contributions from those lighter modes .    comparing the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : kkaxion2 ] and [ fig : kkaxion3 ] , we see that the regions of parameter space which produce the largest total energy densities @xmath134 are also the regions that produce the largest tower fractions @xmath141 , with both quantities decreasing as a function of @xmath41",
    ". these observations are of course consistent with the general correlations previously discussed in relation to fig .",
    "[ fig : rhofracpiesgrand ] .",
    "having focused in this section on the specific situation in which our @xmath20 field is an axion , one possible next step would be to place phenomenological bounds on the parameter spaces we have considered .",
    "such bounds would in principle mirror those which are normally applied to the case of a traditional qcd axion , and come from a variety of considerations including supernova cooling , black hole superradiance , overclosure constraints , dark - matter and dark - energy constraints , traditional axion searches ( such as light shining through walls ) , _",
    "etc_. within the context of the abrupt ( @xmath179 ) limit , such bounds on kk axion towers are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "although the determination of such bounds for general @xmath41 is beyond the scope of this paper , the results we have obtained here concerning the late - time energy densities of these axion systems should play a critical role in helping to determine exactly where these bounds lie for general @xmath41 , and the extent to which the suppressions and enhancements we have observed translate into a loosening or strengthening of those bounds beyond traditional expectations .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the effects of dynamical mass generation on the cosmological abundances of the kaluza - klein modes associated with a bulk scalar field . in particular , we have examined the non - trivial case in which a phase transition localized on a brane leads to time - dependent masses and mixings among these kk modes .",
    "we have found that both the total energy density of the full kk tower and the distribution of that energy density across the individual kk modes are extremely sensitive to the details of the phase transition . as a result , within different regions of model parameter space ,",
    "these abundances can be significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to standard expectations  sometimes by many orders of magnitude .",
    "we have also derived a variety of approximate scaling behaviors and analytic expressions for the energy densities of the kk modes as functions of the relevant model parameters . in order to illustrate the potentially significant impact that these effects can have on the late - time abundances of our scalars within the context of a concrete model",
    ", we have also applied our general results to the case of a bulk axion/ axion - like field . finally , as a by - product of our analysis",
    ", we have also developed an alternate `` uv - based '' effective truncation of kk theories which is physically different from the more traditional `` ir - based '' truncation commonly employed in the literature , yet yields the same higher - dimensional theory as the truncation is lifted .",
    "depending on the identity of the scalar field in question , our results can have a variety of phenomenological implications .",
    "for example , in the case in which our bulk scalar is an axion or axion - like field , one can easily imagine a number of phenomenological consequences .",
    "note that in general , cosmological abundances in this paper have been generated through a two - step process : the assumption of a non - zero vev for one or more modes in the kk tower followed by a mass - generating phase transition .",
    "as such , given the specific form of the initial conditions we have adopted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : initialconditions ] ) , the method of abundance generation we have studied in this paper is tantamount to misalignment production . however , misalignment production is not the only mechanism through which a population of axion - like particles can be produced in the early universe . for example , spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath215 symmetry of sect .",
    "[ sec : axioninthebulk ] can lead to the formation of a network of cosmic strings and other topological defects  @xcite .",
    "if this breaking occurs before cosmic inflation , these defects are simply inflated away . by contrast , if the breaking of @xmath215 occurs after inflation , these defects retain a non - negligible energy density until late times , and their decays can therefore generate a potentially significant contribution to the relic abundance of the corresponding axion - like particles .",
    "indeed , this topic has been studied in detail for the specific case of a qcd axion  @xcite , but in principle applies to other axion - like particles as well .",
    "these considerations are important because the phase - space distribution of a population of axions or axion - like particles produced via the decays of topological defects is significantly different from that generated via misalignment production  @xcite .",
    "thus , in cases in which the misalignment contribution to the overall late - time axion abundance is suppressed by the time - dependent masses and mixings we have discussed here , the phase - space distribution of relic axions can be significantly altered  especially if the contribution from topological defects ends up dominating the total axion abundance .",
    "moreover , the suppression of the misalignment contribution to this overall axion abundance can also serve to weaken the overclosure bound on the axion - decay constant , and thus could potentially enlarge the allowed region of parameter space for the qcd axion .",
    "our results concerning the effects of a mass - generating phase transition can also have significant implications for other new - physics scenarios .",
    "for example , our results may provide a way of mitigating the cosmological moduli problem which arises in supergravity  @xcite and in string theory  @xcite .",
    "indeed , such theories generically predict large numbers of neutral scalar fields  so - called moduli  with flat potentials , long lifetimes , and large ( and even planck - scale ) vevs . on the one hand ,",
    "a number of phenomenological considerations imply that some mechanism must exist through which a potential is generated for these moduli , rendering them massive . on the other hand ,",
    "once these fields acquire masses , they can potentially overclose the universe or precipitate an unacceptably late period of reheating .",
    "a suppression of the collective energy density of such moduli due to time - dependent mixing effects of the sort we have discussed here could potentially provide a way of addressing these issues .",
    "our results also have implications within the context of the dynamical dark matter ( ddm ) framework  @xcite , an alternative framework for dark - matter physics in which a potentially vast ensemble of unstable particles contribute to the present - day dark - matter abundance and in which phenomenological constraints on the dark sector are satisfied through a balancing between constituent decay widths and cosmological abundances across the ensemble .",
    "dark - matter ensembles with these properties emerge naturally in a variety of contexts  @xcite , and detection strategies for such ensembles are discussed in refs .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the kk modes associated with a bulk axion - like field which receives its abundance via misalignment production constitute a viable ddm ensemble  @xcite , the results we have obtained here are thus directly applicable to ddm ensembles of this sort and lead to a suppression of the overall relic abundance of the ensemble for large @xmath41 relative to the relic abundance which arises for the abrupt case considered in refs .",
    "this suppression can potentially widen the phenomenologically allowed parameter space of such ddm models .",
    "moreover , we also note from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhofracpiesgrand ] that there exists a correlation between the overall magnitude of the late - time energy density of the kk tower and the degree to which its distribution across the different kk modes is particularly `` ddm - like '' ( , shared non - trivially across many different kk modes ) , with larger total abundances tending to correlate with increased ddm - like behavior at late times .",
    "thus , we see that we can control the degree to which our ensemble of kk states is truly ddm - like at late times simply by adjusting phenomenological parameters such as @xmath40 and @xmath41 associated with our mass - generating phase transition .",
    "the suppression of late - time scalar abundances due to time - dependent masses and mixings also has potentially important implications for a broad range of additional scenarios involving weakly - coupled scalar particles which receive a non - negligible contribution to their relic abundances from non - thermal mass - generating phase transitions of the sort we have discussed here .",
    "the reason is that in such scenarios , a non - negligible population of these particles can also be produced thermally from scattering processes involving sm particles in the radiation bath .",
    "this production mechanism is often referred to as `` freeze - in ''  @xcite , and it also gives rise to a population of particles whose phase - space distribution differs significantly from that of the population generated by non - thermal mass - generating phase transitions . for the qcd axion ,",
    "the freeze - in contribution to the total relic abundance is typically quite small  @xcite compared to the contributions from other sources , such as misalignment production and cosmic - string and domain - wall decay . by contrast , for other exotic scalars , the freeze - in contribution can be significant .",
    "thus , in scenarios in which both misalignment production and freeze - in production are na \" ively expected to generate comparable contributions to the overall abundance of a particular weakly - coupled scalar particle , a suppression of the former contribution due to time - dependent mixing could both modify overclosure bounds and alter the expected phase - space distribution of the relic scalar population .    in this paper",
    "we have focused on the contribution to the total abundance of a collection of kk scalar modes that arises due to a time - dependent mass - generating phase transition . in so doing , however , we have disregarded the effects of the quantum fluctuations that arise for these fields during the inflationary epoch . in general , fluctuations in the long - wavelength modes of light fields",
    " and , in particular , those modes whose wavelengths exceed the hubble length during that epoch  behave like vacuum energy until after inflation ends .",
    "thus , the energy density in these fluctuations survives inflation and yields an additional contribution to the abundance of any field with mass @xmath254 , where @xmath255 is the value of the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "this additional contribution depends sensitively on the parameters of the inflationary model ( for a review , see , , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and in particular on @xmath255 itself . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that for a kk tower of axion - like fields , the contribution to the relic abundance from vacuum misalignment dominates over this additional contribution from fluctuations during inflation for sufficiently small @xmath255 .",
    "however , we note that in general , this contribution exists and for higher - scale inflationary models may have a significant impact on the overall relic abundance of the kk tower .",
    "in the course of our analysis in this paper , we also derived results for truncated kk towers consisting of only @xmath0 modes , where @xmath151 .",
    "in so doing , we presented the results of this finite-@xmath0 case merely as a stepping stone on the way towards understanding the properties of the full kk tower that emerges in the @xmath256 limit .",
    "however , the results of our finite-@xmath0 analysis are also interesting in their own right .",
    "indeed , the mass - squared matrix for a tower of @xmath0 modes is similar to the mass matrix which emerges in certain `` moose ''  @xcite or `` quiver ''  @xcite gauge theories  theories which also contain only a finite number of modes yet which yield a deconstructed extra spacetime dimension in the @xmath256 limit  @xcite .",
    "thus , the results we have obtained here for such finite-@xmath0 theories should provide guidance as to how time - dependent mass - generating phase transitions and time - dependent mixings will affect the late - time energy densities for the collections of scalars which emerge in such moose or quiver theories .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that the results we have derived in this paper reflect the particular kk - derived mixing structure of our model . as a result ,",
    "we did not observe certain phenomena which may in principle arise for more general systems of scalar fields in the presence of time - dependent mass - generating phase transitions and mixings .",
    "for example , it has been shown  @xcite that in similar scalar systems with more general mixing patterns , parametric resonances can arise which are extremely sensitive to the widths and mixings associated with mass - generating phase transitions and which `` pump '' energy density into a particular field or fields during such phase transitions .",
    "such systems may also exhibit so - called `` re - overdamping '' phenomena  @xcite in which the total energy density of our system exhibits a time dependence which transcends those normally associated with vacuum - dominated or matter - dominated cosmologies .",
    "however , in order for such novel effects to arise , the dynamically generated contribution @xmath257 to the mass - squared matrix at late times must satisfy the criterion @xmath258 and this criterion is not satisfied within the parameter space of our kk model .",
    "however , it is easy to contemplate early - universe scenarios involving multiple scalars in which this condition is satisfied . in such scenarios , parametric resonances and re - overdamping phenomena",
    "can then have a significant further impact on both the total abundance of the scalar fields involved and the distribution of that total abundance among these scalars .",
    "there are a number of potentially interesting generalizations and extensions of this work .",
    "for example , in this paper we have focused on the case in which the higher - dimensional scalar propagates in a single , flat extra dimension .",
    "however , such a flat extra dimension can be viewed as a limit of the more general case of a warped geometry in which the extra dimension represents a slice of anti - de sitter space  @xcite .",
    "such warped compactifications have a variety of phenomenological applications , such as providing ways of addressing the hierarchy between the weak and planck scales  @xcite as well as the hierarchies amongst the masses of the sm fermions  @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to examine how our findings generalize to the case of a warped extra dimension .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider the further generalization of our results to the case of multiple extra dimensions , both flat and warped .",
    "one could also imagine adopting more general initial conditions for our kk modes beyond those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : initialconditions ] ) , such as might arise if there is an earlier phase of non - trivial dynamics ( either in the bulk or on the brane ) prior to our mass - generating phase transition .",
    "another possible avenue for generalization concerns the nature of the cosmological epoch during which we are presuming our dynamics to take place .",
    "for example , throughout this paper we have focused primarily on the case in which the universe is effectively matter - dominated ( , with @xmath259 ) throughout the period of mass generation . indeed , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : themodel ] , phenomenological constraints on theories with large extra spacetime dimensions are more easily satisfied in ltr scenarios , in which the universe remains matter - dominated until very late times .",
    "however , these constraints are considerably weaker in cases in which the compactification scale @xmath64 is @xmath260 or above .",
    "thus , it would also be interesting to consider the case in which the universe is effectively radiation - dominated ( , with @xmath261 ) during the mass - generation epoch .",
    "cosmologies with other values of @xmath262 can be considered as well .    finally , other interesting extensions of this work involve considering a broader variety of cosmological contexts in which mass generation for our kk modes might take place . throughout this paper",
    ", we have implicitly operated under the assumption that the total energy density @xmath99 of the kk tower is negligible compared to the critical density @xmath263 during the mass - generation epoch . under such an assumption , the back - reaction of the kk tower on the evolution of the spacetime metric is therefore negligible during this epoch .",
    "thus , to a very good approximation , we may view the dynamics of the kk modes studied in this paper as taking place within the context of a particular `` background '' cosmology which is effectively decoupled from this dynamics and which is therefore specified by a fixed functional form for the hubble parameter @xmath85 as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "indeed , such assumptions are valid for a variety of light scalars which receive their abundances from misalignment production  including , by necessity , any such fields which serve as dark - matter candidates .",
    "however , one could alternatively consider the opposite regime in which @xmath264 during the mass - generation epoch . under such conditions ,",
    "the back - reaction of the kk tower on @xmath85 can be significant and must be incorporated into the equations of motion for the kk modes .",
    "this situation can arise , for example , in scenarios in which these scalar particles play a role in inflationary dynamics or in which they are responsible for additional , later periods of reheating after inflation in cosmologies with non - thermal histories  @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to study the evolution of the energy densities of the kk modes of our theory in such scenarios .",

    "<S> we study the early - universe cosmology of a kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower of scalar fields in the presence of a mass - generating phase transition , focusing on the time - development of the total tower energy density ( or relic abundance ) as well as its distribution across the different kk modes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both of these features are extremely sensitive to the details of the phase transition and can behave in a variety of ways significant for late - time cosmology . in particular , we find that the interplay between the temporal properties of the phase transition and the mixing it generates are responsible for both enhancements and suppressions in the late - time abundances , sometimes by many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we map out the complete model parameter space and determine where traditional analytical approximations are valid and where they fail . in the latter cases we also provide new analytical approximations which successfully model our results . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we apply this machinery to the example of an axion - like field in the bulk , mapping these phenomena over an enlarged axion parameter space that extends beyond those accessible to standard treatments . </S>",
    "<S> an important by - product of our analysis is the development of an alternate `` uv - based '' effective truncation of kk theories which has a number of interesting theoretical properties that distinguish it from the more traditional `` ir - based '' truncation typically used in the extra - dimension literature .    </S>",
