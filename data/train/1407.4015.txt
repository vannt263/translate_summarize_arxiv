    "strain engineering at the nanometer scale is a fast developing research direction attracting a lot of attention in the last decade .",
    "properly engineered strains can enhance the mobility of charge carriers and hence the performances of electron devices ( , ) .",
    "the control of the strain field in the channel of transistors require measuring strain with a nanometer resolution , which is a difficult challenge .",
    "x - ray diffraction is a very promising tool for this task because it is non destructive and has a high sensitivity to the strain ( ) . the high spatial resolution is currently only achievable by measurements in reciprocal space , since the sizes of the focussed x - ray beams are still far from the desired nanometer - dimensions ( ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the atomic displacement fields arising from elastic strains and the possibility to reconstruct them using x - ray coherent diffraction scattering .",
    "the approach based on the reconstruction of the coherent diffraction pattern - coherent diffractive imaging ( cdi ) - was already proved to be successful for the extraction of the shapes and electron density of some objects (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "the ability of the x - ray cdi to reconstruct the local displacement field was demonstrated several years ago (; ; ; ; ; ) . the frequent failure to reconstruct the data sets from highly strained crystals (; ) hindered , however , the wide application of the method .",
    "recently the ptychography showed its ability to extend to the bragg x - ray diffraction , offering the alternative way of overcoming the convergence problems (; ; ) .",
    "the improved convergence of the conventional method was also achieved by introducing the additional constraints requiring the electron density homogeneity and limiting the first spatial displacement derivatives ( ) .",
    "the successful application of this method , which was not possible otherwise , was illustrated for two particular sets of x - ray experimental data (; ) . in the present manuscript",
    "we further improve the method to extend its applicability to the wider class of elastically strained crystals .",
    "in the next section we start the discussion from the influence of the choice of the origin of the reciprocal space image ( rsi ) on the results of strain field reconstruction .",
    "we discuss the relation between strain - induced broadening in reciprocal space and the inhomogeneity of the deformations . from this",
    ", we specify additional constraints limiting the phase gradients in direct space .",
    "in this manuscript we focus on the benefit of direct space phase constraints without restricting chemical homogeneity .",
    "in particular , we investigate a possible strengthening of phase constraints by not only limiting the first order displacement derivatives ( i.e. , strain ) , but also the second order displacement derivatives ( i.e. , strain gradient ) .",
    "the implementation of the introduced constraints in the iterative algorithm is discussed in the last subsection of the section ii .",
    "section iii demonstrates the application of this approach to experimental x - ray scattering data of a periodically strained system consisting of oxide - filled trenches in crystalline silicon ( ) .",
    "we expect applicability of the introduced additional constraints to a wide class of elastically strained nano- or micro- crystalline structures .",
    "in case of crystalline objects the distribution of the x - ray scattered amplitude in reciprocal space around a reciprocal lattice point ( rlp ) can be approximated as @xmath0{\\rm e}^{-{\\rm i}(\\vec{q}-\\vec{h}).\\vec{r}},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the bragg peak s reciprocal lattice vector and scattering vector , respectively .",
    "@xmath3 is the fourier component of the unstrained periodic electron density and @xmath4 is the displacement field with respect to the non - strained lattice of bulk material .",
    "the formula ( [ diff1 ] ) assumes the validity of the first - order born approximation .",
    "moreover , it assumes that the strains are elastic and relatively small ( ) such as the crystal unit cells within the crystal volume are not deformed but only shifted as a whole , so that their scattering factors ( corresponding to fourier component of non - strained periodic electron density ) are not affected by deformation .",
    "in addition , the application of the coherent imaging methods implies the crystal dimensions do not exceed the coherent volume of the incident x - ray radiation , which is presently in the order of several micrometers at the third generation synchrotron sources (; ) .",
    "the expression ( [ diff1 ] ) expresses a fourier transformation ( ft ) relation between x - rays scattered amplitudes in reciprocal space ( @xmath5 ) and the scatterer density distribution @xmath6 ( i.e. direct space amplitude @xmath3 and phase @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , the inhomogeneously strained crystal under such conditions is recognized essentially as a phase object , whose phase brings the information about the atomic displacements . in case of chemical homogeneity",
    "it becomes a pure phase object .",
    "once the phases of the scattered wavefield are known in far field , scatterer density distribution @xmath8 can be obtained by inverse ft .",
    "since the phases are experimentally not accessible , the _ direct _ investigation of the shape and strain of the crystalline nanostructure requires implementation of a phase retrieval method .",
    "the principle is based on an iterative loop of direct and inverse ft ( towards the experimental intensity distribution and back to the sample space ) and it may refine the genuine scatterer density distribution @xmath8 even by starting with a non realistic model (; ) .",
    "the iterative method composes the core part of cdi .",
    "the well - known problems of the iterative reconstruction of the complex - valued direct - space objects (; ) hinder the application of cdi to reliably study strain fields in highly strained crystals .",
    "the successful inversion of the phase objects representing the inhomogeneously strained crystals requires that appropriate additional constraints are introduced in the iterative scheme .",
    "this relies , besides the support constraint , on _ a priori _ knowledge about the system to be reconstructed resulting in additional constraints during the iterative reconstruction process .",
    "first , we take a closer look on a iterative method having additional constraints limiting the allowed value of strain ( phase gradient in direct space ( ds ) ) .",
    "the possible improvements of this iterative scheme and its extension to second order derivatives of the displacement are discussed in the successive sections .",
    "phases of the reconstructed direct space density @xmath8 are highly sensitive to the choice of the origin of the rsi .",
    "this can be expressed as    @xmath9 \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm e}^{-{\\rm i}(\\vec{q}-(\\vec{h } + \\delta\\vec{h}^{bragg})).\\vec{r } } = \\nonumber\\\\ \\int { \\rm d}^3\\vec{r } \\left[\\varrho_{\\vec{h}}(\\vec{r } ) { \\rm e}^ { -{\\rm i } \\phi(\\vec{r } ) } \\right ] { \\rm e}^{-{\\rm i}(\\vec{q}-(\\vec{h } + \\delta\\vec{h}^{bragg})).\\vec{r}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore any relocation of the origin of rsi from the original rlp is equivalent to the appearance of the corresponding linear term in the phase of @xmath8 :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a shift of the origin of the rsi from the rlp corresponding to the ideal reciprocal lattice denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the position of the rlp can be easily recognised for the substrate crystal by the presence of a strong diffraction peak in reciprocal space due to the strong bragg reflection of the perfect crystal . in the case of a small deformed crystal",
    "the position of the original rlp can not be determined so precisely without any reference , since the inhomogeneous strain modifies the diffraction pattern and makes it broader around rlp .",
    "it redistributes the scattering signal in a broader area around rlp , as compared with the scattering from the strain - free crystal , because of the local changes in the crystal lattice parameter .",
    "the not - slower - than - quadratic decay of intensities in reciprocal space which is usually observed for the unstrained crystal , is no more valid near the rlp .",
    "the width of the intensity cloud can be defined as @xmath12 along the particular @xmath13-direction ( see , for example , @xmath14 in fig .",

    "the exception is a crystal truncation rod of the substrate crystal perpendicular to the crystal surface where the ( slow ) quadratic decay of intensities is observed .",
    "it is also possible to separate the effects of crystal shape and strain in the reciprocal space by considering several bragg reflections . while crystal size broadening is independent of @xmath1 , strain broadening increases proportionally for larger @xmath21 values .",
    "therefore , @xmath12 could be more precisely identified by considering two different rsi having collinear reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "taking into account the shift property of the ft applied to the ( [ diff1 ] ) , the strain - induced broadening @xmath22 of the scattering signal around rlp in @xmath13-direction will be only possible if    @xmath23 - min\\left[\\frac{\\partial \\vec{h}.\\vec{u}(\\vec{r})}{\\partial p}\\right],\\ ] ]    here @xmath24 can be represented as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a 2d vector representing two other orthogonal components of @xmath24 .",

    "reconstruction of the diffraction pattern from an inhomogeneously strained crystal purely based on the geometry of the object ( i.e. its shape ) in direct space is not sufficiently robust for application to experimental data of samples with highly inhomogenous strain : the difficulty to reconstruct successfully depends on the value of inhomogeneity of the spatially resolved strain , which was demonstrated in the case of pure phase objects ( ) . the higher the inhomogeneity of the strain field , the higher the probability to meet the local minima and deep stagnation during the reconstruction (; ) .",
    "the presence of the strong inhomogeneity of the strain field can be recognized by the broadened distribution of the signal around rlp expressed by ( [ broad ] ) , which exceeds the spread of the corresponding crystal shape function decreasing not slower than @xmath30 in reciprocal space ( rs ) .",

    "it represents the strain field inhomogeneity along @xmath13 axis via maximum variation range of the corresponding displacement field derivatives . the phase retrieval method described in ref .   limits the phase variation of the direct - space object ( and therefore the displacement derivatives ) in order to satisfy the relation ( [ broad_dimless ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the application of two inequalities constraints along @xmath13 axis :    @xmath32    which is equivalent to eq.(4 ) in ref .  .",

    "we ensure that the direct - space phase decreases along @xmath13-direction :    @xmath41    in the same way one can move the origin of rsi in the center of the strain - induced broadening along @xmath13 direction by introducing @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "then , constraint ( [ constraint_phases2 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath44    the notation ( [ constraint_phases_middle ] ) was used in definition of phase constraints in refs . and .    adding these constraints to phase retrieval allowed successful reconstruction of the atomic displacements for two particular experimental data sets (; ) collected at european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) .",
    "these constraints to the phase gradients have been combined with constraints exploiting the spatial uniformity of the direct space amplitudes ( resulting from the crystal s chemical homogeneity ) which do not provide successful reconstructions for their own in case of higher strains (; ) . despite the additional constraints to the phases ,",
    "the reconstructions in required permanent manual surveillance of the iterative solution and frequent revisions and modifications of the parameters .",
    "usually , the iterative process starts with constraints ( [ constraint_phases2 ] ) exhibiting a phase limitation gap much smaller than @xmath12 :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the initial guess for the inversion of data from (; ) were usually twice tighter than their final value , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "we speculate , that these inversions have been possible because the displacement gradients of the investigated crystals satisfied eq . ( [ constraint_phases_tight ] ) in most parts of the crystalline volumes .",
    "the gradual relaxation of the constraint ( [ constraint_phases_tight ] ) by shifting @xmath49 towards 1 was required with increasing number of iterations .",
    "this was done under surveillance until the constraint ( [ constraint_phases_tight ] ) has relaxed to value in eq .",
    "( [ constraint_phases2 ] ) .",
    "we expect the method is the most functional if the information about the local distribution of the displacement gradients within the crystal volume is available .",
    "if the less inhomogeneously strained regions @xmath50 can be identified , their local phase variation can be much more constrained than in the other parts where the strain is assumed to vary with higher magnitudes .",
    "this can be performed by specifying parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 in ( [ constraint_phases_tight ] ) applied in the crystal region @xmath50 .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 represents the magnitude of the average deviation between direct - space phase gradients in the subdomains @xmath50 and must satisfy the initial inequalities ( [ constraint_phases2 ] ) by    @xmath53    subdivision of the crystal volume in subvolumes @xmath50  each with local phase constraints as tight as possible  improves the chance to obtain the solution in a shorter time and with less efforts or provides the successful reconstruction for the cases where it is not be possible otherwise .    in practice ,",
    "a nano - focused x - ray beam may help identifying the magnitude of the strain locally . by probing different parts @xmath50 within the investigated crystal volume",
    "the corresponding diffraction patterns may be collected ( ) . the strain magnitudes may be estimated by investigating the collected images , in relation with the particular illuminated local crystal part @xmath50 .",
    "this information may be exploited for spatially resolved adjustment of the constraints ( [ constraint_phases_tight ] ) : an individual choice of @xmath54 and @xmath55 for each @xmath50 part during phase retrieval .",
    "note however , that if the domains @xmath50 become too small , the size effects of the illuminated regions dominate and can hide strain broadening , complicating its estimation .      to improve the convergence properties of the reconstruction algorithm with first order phase derivative constraints ( described in the section above ) further",
    ", we propose to limit components of strain gradients in addition , especially if such an information can be accessible .",
    "thus , we have to limit the second derivatives of the direct - space phases    @xmath56    imposing the limits    @xmath57    where @xmath13 and @xmath58 are two axes over which the differentiation is performed ( @xmath13 and @xmath58 may coincide ) . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the corresponding lower and upper limits",

    ", we do not have a good estimator for the maximum values of strain gradient components directly from the measured diffraction pattern .",
    "however , the limitations might be taken from already known data for other systems of same materials and assuming a similar elastic behavior of the material under similar stresses .",
    "the constraint ( [ constraint_strains ] ) could impose tighter limitations on the strain gradients and relax them gradually with iterations ( similarly to ( [ constraint_phases_tight ] ) by changing @xmath49 with @xmath62 ) . once the constraint , being narrow enough , will be satisfied within a considerable part of the crystal volume , we expect , that the chance to reconstruct the object successfully is substantially increased .",
    "the reconstructions should always reveal the same strain distribution for different magnitude limitations in order to distinguish them from the results of stagnation in the local minima .",
    "moreover , the constraints are suitable for application in part of the crystalline volume only .",
    "this might be required at material interfaces between constituent materials where the second order phase derivatives have discontinuities .",
    "this imposes additional knowledge about the internal geometry of the investigated crystalline structure .",
    "the direct - space additional constraints can be computationally implemented in different ways both for the homogeneity of the amplitudes and for the limit on the phase variation .",
    "here we describe one of the possibilities of implementation of these constraints in a very general way .",
    "the approach allows imposing limitations on strain as well as strain gradients depending on the definition of the corresponding parameter set .",

    "the method extends its successful applicability to larger values of strain inhomogeneity ( [ broad_dimless ] ) where the classical hio+er algorithm fails ( ) .",
    "it was , however , shown that at some strain inhomogeneity ( [ broad_dimless ] ) , even the hio+o@xmath111 algorithm fails to reconstruct the displacement field (; ) . a typical result of the hio+o@xmath111 algorithm  combined with er  to the data from fig .  [ figsti_rsm004_onlygtrs ]",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsti_result_wrong ] . hence , despite the benefits provided by hio+o@xmath111 , the algorithm can not reconstruct the strained silicon line .",
    "[ figsti_result_wrong ]    the next step was an application of the phase retrieval algorithm hio@xmath68 based on the additional constraints . the usual way of iterative reconstruction involves iterative cycle repetitions , where each cycle contains several iterations of hio@xmath68 ( or hio+o@xmath111 in previous case ) followed by several iterations of er .",
    "we used an algorithm cycle consisting of 50 iterations of hio@xmath68 followed by 20 iterations of er .",
    "several different parameters sets were used to study the convergence of the full algorithm with the additional constraints . fixing the particular set of parameters in our hio@xmath68 is not always the best strategy .",
    "human monitoring and interaction with the iterative process by changing some of the algorithm s parameters ( in a similar way as introduced in ( [ constraint_phases_tight ] ) by changing @xmath49 ) was found to be often useful in order to improve the convergence of the algorithm to the solution for the data set .",
    "a dedicated software with graphical user interface was developed in order to monitor and interact with the convergence process .",
    "the constraints on the first phase derivatives along vertical @xmath113 as well as horizontal @xmath114 direction were introduced by hio@xmath68 . in this case @xmath75 consists of one neighbouring point along @xmath113 or @xmath114 for each point @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath73 limits the phase derivatives according to ( [ epsilon_p_relation1 ] ) .",
    "the freedom in the choice of the origin of rsi is compensated by the corresponding value of @xmath79 in ( [ hio_ap : c ] ) , which corresponds to the shift of origin from the center of the strain - induced broadening in rs .",
    "the sampling of our dsi , which depends on the dimensions of the measured area in reciprocal space , is @xmath115 nm in horizontal direction and @xmath116 nm in vertical direction .",
    "the natural direction for phase gradient limitations is @xmath113 because the strain - induced broadening @xmath14 is larger ( see fig .",
    "[ figsti_rsm004_onlygtrs ] ) and consiquently the variation freedom of the displacement gradients is higher .",
    "constraints on the phase variation in the vertical direction @xmath113  by introducing the magnitude of @xmath117 ( see in fig .  [ figsti_rsm004_onlygtrs ] )  does not help inverting our data in the framework of the hio@xmath68 algorithm : several tens of trials having thousands of iterations did not provide the solution .",
    "moreover , the solution was never reached if both directions ( @xmath113 or @xmath114 ) have been constraint by @xmath73 equal to 0.2 , 0.5 , 1 and 2 . in all sets of parameters we used a relatively large @xmath118 , which is approximately a 30% of average amplitude of the solution .",
    "we avoided manual adjustment of the constraints ( see ( [ constraint_phases_tight ] ) and discussion ) throughout the iterative process , since it relies on intuition and can not be generalized easily to other structures .",
    "instead , we introduced additional knowledge about the localization of the strain in the substrate and in the line regions .",
    "the support area was subdivided into two regions , namely , the etched line itself ( @xmath119 ) and the region underneath ( @xmath120 ) , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figsti_result_firstderiv](a ) .",
    "each of them is responsible for the scattering in the vicinity of rlp of line and silicon substrate correspondingly , which are separated in rs ( see fig .",
    "[ figsti_rsm004_onlygtrs ] ) .",
    "the parameters of hio@xmath68 algorithm were chosen differently for @xmath119 and @xmath120 , taking into account the local broadening and the shift of both peaks .",
    "a successful choice is the vicinity @xmath75 consisting of one previous point along @xmath113 and corresponding to the limiting of the first vertical phase derivatives .",
    "the corresponding parameters of  differ for both support regions @xmath119 and @xmath120 . for @xmath120 @xmath121 with @xmath89 , if the origin of rsi coincides with rlp of silicon substrate . for @xmath119 @xmath122 with @xmath123 ( the minus coming from the definition of ft",
    "is not shown here ) .",
    "the related solution , however , contains some artifacts resulting from the subdivision of the system in two parts ( see the typical example of the solution in fig .",
    "[ figsti_result_firstderiv ] ) . for this system we found a more reliable approach based on limiting the second phase derivatives , which allows for the successful inversion .",
    "[ figsti_result_firstderiv ]    [ figsti_result ]    constraints on the second order phase derivatives ( by defining @xmath75 as two neighbouring points of point @xmath65 in  ) were then introduced . along the horizontal direction ( @xmath124 )",
    "the algorithm did not show the desired robustness for the inversion of our system .",
    "apart from a few seldom convergences to an image resembling the main solution features , the algorithm usually ended up with different results which are far from the solution .",
    "these rare cases have only been observed for very small values of @xmath73 , namely 0.02 and 0.05 which is related to the maximum allowed second phase derivative via eq .",
    "( [ epsilon_p_relation2 ] ) . limiting the strain gradients in lateral direction",
    "does not have a direct impact on vertical phase gradients , which large variation freedom ( see ( [ broad_dimless ] ) ) is the main reason of the algorithm stagnation .",
    "[ figsti_displ ]    the successful choice was the limitation of phase variation along the vertical direction ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the strong spatial variations of the vertical phase gradients , in case of reconstruction of wrong results ( such as e.g. in fig .",
    "[ figsti_result_wrong ] ) , appear not in the correct places of the object .",
    "the splashes of the magnitudes of the second phase derivatives , which do not exist in case of the correct solution , appear to compensate such wrong phase behavior and are limited now by the current choice of the algorithm parameters .",
    "the level of metric error ( [ error_metric ] ) is a complementary measure of the successful convergence together with the visual evaluation of the results , since the presence of noise and other experimental artifacts make only small differences between metric errors of local minima and the correct solution .",
    "after several cycles the metric error usually approaches the level of 0.01 - 0.05 .",
    "the solution is usually found once the metric error reaches 0.004 - 0.007 .",
    "therefore , the drop in the metric error after approaching the solution is very often relatively small . the chance to reach the solution was best for @xmath126 . for larger values",
    "( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) it was also possible to find the solution , the convergence to the correct result was , however , less stable . for even larger values ,",
    "successful reconstructions have been observed very seldom .",
    "if the metric error does not drop below 0.01 level after several thousands of iterations , it indicates stagnation which can not be easily overcome by the current set of constraints parameters . therefore , a new trial ",
    "having new random phases in reciprocal space as initial guess  is taken and the procedure is repeated .",
    "an interesting point here is that we barely needed to interactively adjust the value of @xmath73 throughout the iterative process : it was only required for later refinement aiming to decrease the error to a lower level . at that point ,",
    "the main features of the phase field of the solution were already reconstructed .    a typical result for the solution is shown in fig .  [ figsti_result ] .",
    "the non - perfectly homogeneous distribution of amplitudes within the silicon line volume might be the sign of the presence of the disturbances violating the validity of the model , such as , for example , the strong scattering from the substrate .",
    "the inhomogeneities of the amplitudes were observed when reconstructing the blurred diffraction data ( ) .",
    "the quality of the measured data in terms photon noise and signal to noise ratio can also affect the quality of reconstructions ( see e.g. ) .",
    "the phases clearly reflect an almost linear increase along the @xmath113-direction inside the line , which corresponds to a uniformly changed vertical lattice parameter .",
    "the corresponding vertical components of the displacement field in the silicon line are shown in fig .",
    "[ figsti_displ](a ) .",
    "they are retrieved by unwrapping the phases from fig .",
    "[ figsti_result](b ) and substituting them into eq .",
    "[ phases ] .",
    "the retrieved components of displacements are in very good agreement with the corresponding displacement field calculated by finite element modelling for the same semiconductor structures ( ) . in fig .",
    "[ figsti_displ](b ) the retrieved phases are depicted if the origin of the rsi is shifted to the second maxima of the rlp of the line ( @xmath129 in ( [ phases ] ) ) .",
    "the analysis of the influence of additional constraints ( [ constraint_phases2 ] ) and ( [ constraint_strains ] ) for coherent diffractive imaging of inhomogeneously strained crystals was performed .",
    "the suggested direct - space constraints limit the maximum magnitudes of the first and second order phase derivatives .",
    "one possible way of their implementation was suggested by modifying the hybrid input output algorithm to eq .  .",
    "the developed algorithm was tested on experimental diffraction data from periodic strained silicon lines .",
    "the results from our reconstructions reveal the complexity of iterative reconstruction of the strained crystalline objects . limiting the first order phase derivatives ( [ constraint_phases2 ] ) provided successful reconstruction only in case of subdivision of the full support into two regions ( line and substrate ) with individual bounds for every domain s constraints .",
    "this is additional _ a priori _ knowledge about our system .",
    "however , convergence was still not reliable .",
    "the best results were observed when implementing only constraints to the second order phase derivatives ( [ constraint_strains ] ) . in this case , it was sufficient to consider the entire support as one unit : no subdivision was required .",
