    "we have discovered that the string - like assembly , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frog2dnvts20v07t01n10800_005500000mcs ] , is observed in the interval @xmath90 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the vicinity of @xmath21 . at this step width @xmath21 ,",
    "when the particles are closely and linearly packed on a straight line , both the inner cores and the outer cores of the particles simultaneously pinch and confine each other . therefore , the region of the string - like assembly ranges around @xmath21 .",
    "real systems corresponding to the model particles , which are interacting via the square - step repulsive potential , @xmath5 , or the square - step potential with the attractive square - well , were absent in previous studies  @xcite . however , in the present study , the interaction potential @xmath5 has been linked to polymer - grafted colloidal particles , _",
    "i.e. _ real particles , and been derived from the numerical self - consistent field ( scf ) calculation  @xcite .    with the use of the scf method , we are able to calculate the interaction potential between a pair of polymer - grafted colloidal particles for various physical and chemical parameter sets , _",
    "e.g. _ polymer chain length , block - ratio , grafting density , monomer species , and solvent quality .",
    "these results are fed into the particle monte carlo scheme .",
    "thus , combining our particle monte carlo and scf calculation results , we can predict and control the phase behaviour of any diblock copolymer - grafted colloidal systems .",
    "this methodology allows us to extend this approach to more sophisticated block copolymers and colloidal systems .",
    "the string - like assembly itself is also useful for application . as an example ,",
    "when the hydrophilic blocks of the grafted polymers that cover the colloid with a thin swollen shell are composed of dielectric material and the thick hydrophobic brush that fills the inside of the shell consists of conductive material , our system can serve as a nano - switching device ; the system can conduct the electricity only in the percolated phase .",
    "another example is display devices with use of the difference between the string - like assembly and the disordered phase .",
    "the authors wish to thank professors komajiro niizeki and andrei v. zvelindovsky , who gave us helpful suggestions and discussions .",
