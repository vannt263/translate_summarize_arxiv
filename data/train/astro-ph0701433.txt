    "measurements of luminosity distance to type ia supernovae ( sne ; @xcite ) in combination with the location of the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum @xcite , as well as the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum @xcite provide an accurate determination of the geometry and matter / energy content of the universe .",
    "these measurements are almost exclusively sensitive to the cosmological parameters through a time integral of the hubble parameter ( or , the expansion rate ) . although direct measurements of the hubble parameter are feasible , they are typically difficult . for instance , the bao probe radial modes are directly sensitive to @xmath1 @xcite , but require exceedingly precise knowledge of individual galaxy redshifts . in addition",
    ", the few proposals to directly measure the expansion rate all propose to determine @xmath1 at a few specific epochs : @xmath2 ( from , say , the bao , or by measuring the relative ages of passively evolving galaxies @xcite ) , @xmath3 ( from the cmb @xcite ) and @xmath4 ( from the big bang nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "in particular , a new cosmological window would open if we could directly measure the cosmic expansion within the `` redshift desert '' , ideally exploring @xmath5 .    during the early years of big - bang cosmology allan sandage studied a possibility of directly measuring the temporal variation of the redshift of extra - galactic sources @xcite . as explained in the next section , this temporal variation",
    "is directly related to the expansion rate at the source redshift .",
    "however , measurements performed at time intervals separated by less than @xmath6 years would have failed to detect the cosmic signal with the technology available at that time @xcite . in 1998",
    "these ideas have been revisited by loeb @xcite .",
    "he argued that spectroscopic techniques developed for detecting the reflex motion of stars induced by unseen orbiting planets could be used to detect the redshift variation of quasar ( qso ) lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines .",
    "a sample of a few hundred qsos observed with high resolution spectroscopy with a @xmath7 meter telescope could in fact detect the cosmological redshift variation at @xmath8 in a few decades . in what follows",
    "we will therefore refer to this method as the `` sandage - loeb '' ( sl ) test .",
    "the astronomical community has since entertained increasingly ambitious ideas with proposals for building a new generation of extremely large telescopes ( @xmath9 meter diameter ) @xcite .",
    "equipped with high resolution spectrographs , these powerful machines could provide spectacular advances in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "the cosmic dynamics experiment ( codex ) spectrograph has been recently proposed to achieve such a goal @xcite .",
    "the large number of absorption lines typical of the lyman-@xmath0 forest provide an ideal method for measuring the shift velocity .",
    "the latter can be detected by subtracting the spectral templates of a quasar taken at two different times .",
    "as quasar systems are now readily targeted and observable in the redshift range @xmath5 , we have a new test of the cosmic expansion history during the epoch just past the dark ages when the first objects in the universe are forming .",
    "if dark energy is consistent to our simplest models  small zero - point energy of the vacuum or a slowly rolling scalar field  then it significantly speeds up the expansion rate of the universe at @xmath10 . under the same assumption ,",
    "dark energy is subdominant at redshift @xmath11 , and almost completely negligible at @xmath12 .",
    "one may therefore ask whether is worthwhile to probe @xmath12 anyway . the answer is affirmative : since we do not know much about the physical provenance of dark energy , it is useful to adopt an entirely empirical approach and look for the signatures of dark energy at all available epochs regardless of the expectations .",
    "this question has recently been studied in some detail by linder @xcite , who considered toy models of dark energy that have non - negligible energy density at high redshift .    in this paper",
    "we study the cosmological constraints that can be inferred from future observations of velocity shift and their impact on different classes of dark energy models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sl ] we review the physics behind the sl test , in secs .  [ sec : standard ] and [ sec : nonstandard ] we describe future constraints on standard and non - standard dark energy models respectively , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss our results and future prospects .",
    "it is useful to firstly review a standard textbook calculation of the friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology . consider an isotropic source emitting at rest . since it does not posses any peculiar motion , the comoving distance to an observer at the origin remains fixed .",
    "then waves emitted during the time interval ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and detected later during ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) satisfy the relation @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the time of emission and @xmath15 the time of observation . for small time intervals ( @xmath19 )",
    "this gives the well known redshift relation of the radiation emitted by a source at @xmath13 and observed at @xmath15 , @xmath20 let us now consider waves emitted after a period @xmath21 at @xmath22 and detected later at @xmath23 . similarly to the previous derivation the observed redshift of the source at @xmath23 is @xmath24 therefore an observer taking measurements at times @xmath15 and @xmath23 would measure the following variation of the source redshift @xmath25 in the approximation @xmath26 , we can expand the ratio @xmath27 to linear order and further using the relation @xmath28\\delta{t}_{\\rm s}$ ] ( as it can be easily inferred from eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) ) we obtain @xmath29\\delta{t}_o.\\ ] ] this redshift variation can be expressed as a spectroscopic velocity shift , @xmath30 . using the friedmann equation to relate @xmath31 to the matter and energy content of the universe we finally obtain ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath32 , \\label{dv}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is hubble constant",
    ", @xmath34 is the ( scaled ) hubble parameter at redshift @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the speed of light , and we have normalized the scale factor to @xmath37 and neglected the contribution from relativistic components . for a constant dark energy equation of state",
    "we have    @xmath38^\\frac{1}{2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the matter and dark energy density relative to critical , @xmath41 is the curvature , and @xmath42 is the dark energy equation of state .    in figure  [ fig:1 ]",
    "we plot @xmath43 as function of the source redshift in the flat case for different values of @xmath39 and @xmath42 assuming a time interval @xmath44 years .",
    "as we can see @xmath43 is positive at small redshifts and becomes negative at @xmath12 . under the assumption of flatness the amplitude and slope of the signal",
    "depend mainly on @xmath45 , while the dependence on @xmath42 is weaker .    in spite of the tiny amplitude of the velocity shift",
    ", the absorption lines in the quasar ly-@xmath0 provide a powerful tool to detect such a small signal . as already pointed out in @xcite",
    "the width of these lines is of order @xmath46 @xmath47 , with metal lines even narrower .",
    "although these are still a few orders of magnitude larger than the cosmic signal we seek to measure , each ly-@xmath0 spectrum has hundreds of lines .",
    "therefore spectroscopic measurements with a resolution @xmath48 for a sample of @xmath49 qsos observed @xmath50 years apart can lead to a positive detection of the cosmic signal .",
    "moreover astrophysical systematic effects such as peculiar velocities and accelerations can lead to negligible corrections @xcite .",
    "local accelerations may indeed be more important , but due to their direction dependence they can be determined from velocity shift measurements of qsos sampled in different directions on the sky .",
    "in @xcite the authors have performed monte carlo simulations of lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines to estimate the uncertainty on @xmath43 as measured by the codex spectrograph .",
    "the statistical error can be parametrized in terms of the spectral signal - to - noise @xmath51 , the number of ly-@xmath0 quasar systems @xmath52 , and the quasar s redshift    @xmath53    ( at @xmath54 ) where @xmath51 is defined per @xmath55 pixel .",
    "the source redshift dependence becomes flat at @xmath56 .",
    "the numerical factor slightly changes with the source redshift , varying from @xmath57 at @xmath58 to @xmath59 at @xmath60 .",
    "this small variation arises because the number of observed absorption lines decreases with @xmath61 . for simplicity",
    "we assume its value to be fixed to @xmath57 .",
    "the large @xmath51 necessary to detect the cosmic signal implies that a positive detection is not feasible with current telescopes .",
    "however the codex spectrograph is currently being designed to be installed on the eso extremely large telescope ; a @xmath62 meter giant that can reach the necessary signal - to - noise with just few hours integration .    in the next sections we describe the cosmological window that such observations could open , with particular focus on dark energy models .",
    "we forecast constraints on cosmological parameters from velocity shift measurements using the fisher matrix method for a lcdm fiducial cosmology .",
    "we assume experimental configuration and uncertainties similar to those expected from codex @xcite .",
    "namely we consider a survey observing a total of @xmath63 qsos uniformly distributed in @xmath64 equally spaced redshift bins in the range @xmath65 , with a signal - to - noise @xmath66 , and the expected uncertainty as given by eq .",
    "( [ sig ] ) . since there is no time integration involved in the computation of @xmath43 the fisher matrix components can be easily determined analytically .    in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show the near - future status of measurements of the hubble parameter at different cosmological epochs .",
    "we assume upcoming measurements of @xmath33 accurate to 2% , the overall bao measurements of the expansion rate to 1% @xcite , the cmb measurement of 1.4% @xcite , and the sl test measurement of @xmath67 using the assumptions outlined above . for clarity we do not show the big bang nucleosynthesis constraint on @xmath1 with @xmath68 , which is accurate to @xmath50% ( e.g.@xcite ) and",
    "will improve as soon as the baryon density and deuterium abundance are more accurately determined .",
    "since type ia supernovae , number counts of clusters , and weak gravitational lensing do not measure the hubble constant directly , we only indicate their approximate redshift range with the shaded region .",
    "clearly , the sl test is probing an era not covered with any other reliable cosmological probe .    in figure  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we plot the @xmath69 contours in the @xmath70 plane as expected from type ia supernovae , weak lensing power spectrum , power spectrum plus the bispectrum , and constraints expected from planck s measurement of distance to the last scattering surface .",
    "supernova and weak lensing estimates are based on the snap mission @xcite , and sne include systematic errors .",
    "the sl contour are complementary to those of other tests since @xmath43 probes a different degeneracy line in the @xmath70 plane .",
    "it is worth noticing that such measurements are mostly sensitive to the matter density , as expected from the plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . allowing also for variation of the curvature , @xmath71",
    ", we find that the sl test alone determines the matter density about four times better than the curvature . as an example , for the 30-year survey the marginalized errors are @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    we have also found that limited accuracy in the hubble constant measurement does not degrade the power of the sl test .",
    "for example , if @xmath74 is known to 0.04 ( or to about 5% ) , the accuracy in @xmath42 is degraded by only 2% relative to the case when @xmath74 is perfectly known .",
    "as far as dark energy is concerned , assuming a gaussian prior on @xmath74 with @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 for @xmath77 years time interval and @xmath78 for @xmath79 years .",
    "thus the constraints on @xmath42 are not competitive with those inferred from other , well - established tests such as sne ia , weak lensing or bao once we take into account that the latter probes will provide strong constraints by the time the sl test is undertaken .",
    "however , one should note that the constraints obtained by sl decrease _ linearly _ with time .",
    "for measurements made over a century , and with the expectedly larger number of qsos , the sl limits on @xmath42 can easily be at the few percent level .",
    "a unique advantage of the sl test is that it probes the redshift range @xmath5 which is very difficult to access otherwise . as mentioned in section",
    "[ intro ] , probing this redshift range is important for testing non - standard dark energy models that would otherwise be indistinguishable from those with a smooth , nearly or exactly constant equation of state function @xmath80 .",
    "wmap observations in combination with low - redshift limits from sne ia impose a weak upper bound on the amount of dark energy deep during matter domination to be @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that dark energy re - emerged at @xmath82 with @xmath83 in this range , while essentially zero at larger redshifts and that it behaved as a standard @xmath84cdm  at @xmath85 ( i.e.  assuming standard @xmath86 , @xmath87 values ) .",
    "we would like to distinguish such a model from a pure @xmath84cdm  with @xmath88 and @xmath42 as above .",
    "clearly , low - redshift probes ( sne , bao , galaxy clustering ) can not distinguish these two models since the required redshift is too high even for the most ambitious surveys .",
    "furthermore , the distance to the last scattering surface between the two models differs only by 0.5% , which is too low to be observable even with planck , since the 1-@xmath89 uncertainty is about 0.4% with temperature and polarization information @xcite .",
    "however , the two models _ can _ be distinguished via the sl test at about 3-@xmath89 level , assuming only a 10-year survey and other specifications as in the previous section .    while the aforementioned scenario with dark energy emerging in the specific window at @xmath90 may seem contrived , it is easy to find physically motivated models whose identification can significantly benefit from data in this `` desert ''",
    ". one example is given by scalar field models which predict the periodic emergence of de at various epochs during the history of the universe @xcite . even though for these particular models one has to go to a much higher redshift to see the next phase where @xmath91 , it is plausible , and certainly currently observationally allowed ( e.g.@xcite ) that such a phase could have occurred somewhere within @xmath5 .",
    "another example is given by models with dark energy - dark matter interaction ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the simplest realization where the scalar field only couples to dark matter , it mediates a long range interaction which causes two separate effects .",
    "first , dark matter particles , unlike the baryons , experience a scalar - tensor type of gravity , which modifies the newtonian regime ( see @xcite ) . the time and scale of when such type of modification becomes cosmologically relevant depend on the particular model considered .",
    "second , dark matter particles acquire a time dependent mass whose evolution is determined by the specifics of the scalar field dynamics . as a consequence of this , the redshift evolution of the dark matter density deviates from the usual @xmath92 . at low redshift ,",
    "when the universe is dark energy dominated , these models can not be distinguished from the standard @xmath84cdm  .",
    "therefore , the best way to probe models with such dark matter - dark energy interaction is to map out cosmic expansion during the matter dominated phase ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the sl tests offers a unique tool to do just that .    in order to forecast",
    "how well a deviation of the dark matter density from the @xmath92 law can be detected , we parametrize its redshift evolution as @xmath93 in the range @xmath65 , where @xmath94 is a constant free parameter . the scalar field , on the other hand , can be treated as a dark energy component with @xmath95 , since the field slowly rolls toward the minimum of its effective potential at late times @xcite . assuming a flat fiducial model with @xmath96 and @xmath87 , we find that the sl test can detect deviations from the standard matter scaling as small as @xmath97 ( i.e. @xmath98 ) over @xmath99 years and @xmath100 for @xmath79 years .",
    "therefore , sl test can provide constraints an order of magnitude tighter than those inferred using future sne ia or the alcock - paczynsky test @xcite .",
    "since the deviation @xmath101 is generally a function of redshift , one can use the velocity shift measurements to reconstruct the redshift dependence of @xmath101 , and then determine the strength and functional form of the scalar interaction .",
    "the chaplygin gas is yet another dark energy candidate that can be tested in the range of redshift probed by the sl test . proposed as a phenomenological prototype of unified dark energy and dark matter model @xcite",
    ", it describes an exotic fluid with an inverse power law homogeneous equation of state , @xmath102 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , where @xmath103 is the present equation of state , @xmath104 is the current energy density of the gas @xmath105 is the total energy density and @xmath106 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "this corresponds to a fluid which behaves as dust in the past and as cosmological constant in the future . for @xmath107",
    "the model reduces to @xmath84cdm @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas energy density evolves with redshift according to :    @xmath108^{1\\over 1+\\alpha } .\\ ] ]    as shown in @xcite this model can provide a good fit to current cosmological observables with @xmath109 ( with a baryonic component of @xmath110 ) , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we can see that although this model has a velocity shift at @xmath113 similar to that of a @xmath84cdm  , it can be tested with high redshift measurements .",
    "for instance we find that , for this particular model , the chaplygin parameters can be determined with uncertainties @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively and thus distinguished from the @xmath84cdm  values at a high confidence level .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the prospects for constraining dark energy at high redshift ( @xmath5 ) by direct measurements of the temporal shift of the quasar lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines ( the sandage - loeb effect ) .",
    "while the signal is extremely small , the physics is straightforward , and the measurement is certainly within reach of future large telescopes with high resolution spectrographs .",
    "as the sl test mostly probes the matter density at high redshift , the constraints on standard dark energy models with a nearly or exactly constant equation of state @xmath42 are weaker than those that observations of sn ia , bao , weak lensing and number counts will be able to achieve in the future ( although the sl test becomes competitive for measurements spread over a period of several decades or more ) .",
    "this is mostly because the sensitivity of cosmological probes to standard dark energy models is exhausted at @xmath116 and higher redshift data do not improve them significantly ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the principal power of sl measurements at @xmath5 comes from their ability to constrain _ non - standard _ dark energy models , where the dark energy density is non - negligible at higher redshifts  or equivalently , models where the total energy density does not scale with redshift as @xmath92 at @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , as discussed in the previous section , in only one decade the sl measurements will allow to test the redshift scaling of the matter density with an accuracy one order of magnitude greater than standard cosmological tests .",
    "tighter constraints on standard dark energy models could be obtained if observations of ly-@xmath0 systems were feasible at @xmath2 .",
    "what are the prospects for performing the sl test at lower redshift ?",
    "for this to be possible uv space - based instruments are necessary .",
    "space - based uv lyman-@xmath0 astronomy is possible and has already produced remarkable results ( see e.g @xcite ) , though it generally lacks the spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of the higher redshift studies .",
    "however during the past few years high quality observations of several low redshift qsos have been obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and its space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that future space based experiments will be able to measure the sl effect at low redshift .",
    "other astrophysical probes that can potentially explore the redshift desert are not yet well understood .",
    "for instance , it might be possible to measure the angular diameter distance at redshift of 10 - 20 from the acoustic oscillations in the power - spectrum of the 21 cm brightness fluctuations @xcite .",
    "further , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g.  @xcite ) have been proposed as alternative standard candles .",
    "these can probe roughly the same redshift range as the sl ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "similarly gravitational wave `` standard sirens '' can measure distances to gw sources all the way out to @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "however , the prospects of turning the grbs into standard candles is extremely uncertain at this time , and it is not clear that they can be used as cosmological probes .",
    "the gw sirens , while potentially providing amazingly accurate distance measurement , suffer from gravitational lensing of the signal , which adds an effective noise term to distance measurements and greatly degrades their power to constrain cosmological models @xcite .",
    "conversely , the sl test is based on extremely simple physics and involves controllable systematic errors , but it does require a powerful instrument and patience to wait at least a decade before repeating the measurements in order to produce interesting results .",
    "we finally point out that the velocity shift signal increases linearly with time , thus amply rewarding increased temporal separation between measurements .",
    "therefore observations made over a period of several decades by a generation of patient cosmologists may provide definitive constraints on the expansion history in the era before the usual standard candles and rulers , type ia supernovae and acoustic oscillations in the distribution of galaxies , become readily available .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank paolo molaro and matteo viel for useful discussions , and avi loeb for comments on the manuscript .",
