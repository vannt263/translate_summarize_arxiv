    ", the reliability of the equations for determining the o@xmath7/h@xmath8 and o@xmath9/h@xmath8 ionic oxygen abundances depends to a great part on the reliability of the atomic data . @xcite",
    "have compared the ionic oxygen abundances derived with a recent set of equations using the latest atomic data ( @xcite ) , with those determined from an earlier set of equations ( @xcite ) and have found close agreement .",
    "thus , the equations for the determination of the ionic oxygen abundances in hii regions appear to be robust , in the sense that , for a given set of measured electron temperatures t@xmath4 and t@xmath3 , relations determined by different authors result in close oxygen abundances in hii regions .    the electron temperatures @xmath0 within the [ oiii ] zone and @xmath1 within the [ oii ] zone are determined from diagnostic line ratios when they are available .",
    "the intensity ratio of the [ oiii]@xmath10 nebular line to the [ oiii]@xmath11 auroral line is used to determine t@xmath4 . as for t@xmath3 , the intensity ratio of the [ oii]@xmath12 nebular line to the [ oii]@xmath13 auroral line is used .",
    "based on a sample of hii regions where all the necessary oxygen lines are detected , @xcite found that the t@xmath3 temperatures show a large scatter and that they are nearly uncorrelated with t@xmath4 temperatures .",
    "they noted that the measurements of the faint [ oii]@xmath13 auroral lines may contain large random errors .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have pointed out that the [ oii]@xmath12/[oii]@xmath13 ratio may be affected by recombination .",
    "@xcite have derived t@xmath3 and t@xmath4 from the above ratios for a sample of hii regions .",
    "they concluded that the two temperatures generally follow the t@xmath3 ",
    "t@xmath4 relation obtained from photoionization models ( e.g. stasinska 1982 , 1990 ) , but that the scatter of the data points is very large .",
    "the large scatter was attributed to large flux errors of the weak [ oii]@xmath13 emission lines .",
    "the intensity ratio of the [ nii]@xmath14 nebular line to the [ nii]@xmath15 auroral line is also used to determine t@xmath3 .",
    "it seems to give more reliable values .",
    "however , the contribution of recombination to the excitation of the [ nii]@xmath15 line may affect temperatures derived from the [ nii ] nebular to auroral line ratios @xcite . the ( [ nii]@xmath14)/[nii]@xmath15 ratio is measured in only a few hii regions with a detected ( [ oiii]@xmath10)/[oiii]@xmath11 line ratio .    when only a single temperature measurement is available , a t@xmath3  t@xmath4 relation based on grids of hii region models is usually used .",

    "* ) , but the agreement between them is not very good .",

    "this allows one to relax the arbitrarity in the choice of the @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath0 relation .",
    "the basic idea is the following .",
    "usually , the set of equations used for the determination of the ionic o@xmath7/h@xmath8 and o@xmath9/h@xmath8 abundances in hii regions is applied to the whole nebula .",
    "if we apply the equation for o@xmath7/h@xmath8 only to the o@xmath7 zone , then this would yield , not the ionic o@xmath7/h@xmath8 abundance , but the total o / h oxygen abundance instead .",
    "there is no reason to suspect that the oxygen abundances in the o@xmath7 and o@xmath9 zones differ .",
    "we therefore require that the equation for o@xmath7/h@xmath8 applied to the o@xmath7 zone and the one for o@xmath9/h@xmath8 applied to the o@xmath9 zone result in exactly the same value of the oxygen abundance .",
    "this condition allows us to derive a relation between t@xmath3 and t@xmath4 .",
    "we can apply the equation for o@xmath7/h@xmath8 to the o@xmath7 zone alone , only if we know the contribution of the o@xmath7 zone to the measured h@xmath16 flux of the hii region .",

    "the excitation parameter p can be expressed as : p = r@xmath4/(r@xmath3+r@xmath4 ) .",
    "a large sample of high - precision measurements of hii regions is at the base of the present investigation .",
    "we include first the sample of @xcite who have carried out an extensive search of the literature to compile a list of more than 700 individual spectra of hii regions in irregular and spiral galaxies , with the requirement that they all possess a detected [ oiii ]  @xmath11 emission line .",
    "while we have tried to include as many sources as possible , we do not claim our search to be exhaustive .",

    "the exact boundary is difficult to establish , but we have chosen that value because we will be using later the ff relation which is applicable at metallicities above 12+log(o / h ) @xmath29 8.25 . we have extracted from our total sample a subsample of high - metallicity hii regions with an oxygen abundance 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.25 .",

    "this is the result of a selection effect .",
    "indeed , a large positive value of d@xmath30 means that the observed r@xmath26 is significantly overestimated .",
    "this leads to a substantial overestimate of the electron temperature and an underestimate of the oxygen abundance , bringing it lower than our metallicity cut - off of 12+log(o / h ) = 8.25 .",
    "this effect thus systematically depletes the number of high - metallicity hii regions with a large positive d@xmath30 . to free ourselves from this systematic effect , we select only measurements with the absolute value of d@xmath30 less than 0.05 .",

    "if we apply the equation used to calculate the ionic abundance o@xmath7/h@xmath8 not to the entire hii region but only to the o@xmath7 zone , then this would yield , not the ionic o@xmath7/h@xmath8 abundance but the total o / h oxygen abundance instead .",
    "we require that the equation for o@xmath7/h@xmath8 applied to the o@xmath7 zone and the one for o@xmath9/h@xmath8 applied to the o@xmath9 zone result in exactly the same value of the oxygen abundance .",

    "we have applied this method to a sample of 372 hii regions selected to have high - quality measurements by using the ff relation @xcite .",
