    "in 1996 , zirnbauer  @xcite invented a generalized hubbard - stratonovitch transformation which trades an integration over a `` color '' gauge group for an integration over a certain supersymmetric coset space , or `` flavor '' space .",
    "although the transformation was originally derived to study disordered systems in condensed matter physics , the terminology comes from lattice gauge theory because the integral over the gauge group to which the color - flavor transformation is applied is precisely of the form of a one - link integral in lattice gauge theory at infinite coupling .",
    "the fields that appear in the transformation carry two types of indices that will be refered to as color and flavor indices .",
    "the number of colors is denoted by @xmath4 , and the numbers of bosonic and fermionic flavors are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "zirnbauer derived versions of the color - flavor transformation for the three color groups u(@xmath4 ) , o(@xmath4 ) , and sp(@xmath7 )  @xcite . in his original work ,",
    "the flavor space contained an equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom , but it is possible to relax this constraint  @xcite .",
    "convergence requirements then place an upper bound on the difference between the number of bosons and fermions . for the case of u@xmath0 ,",
    "this bound is given by @xmath8 .",
    "the color - flavor transformation has been used in a number of physical applications , e.g. , in the derivation of a field theory for the random flux model by altland and simons  @xcite and in the construction of chiral lagrangians for lattice gauge theories by nagao and nishigaki  @xcite . in the latter paper ,",
    "the calculations were done for the above - mentioned color groups . however , in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) the color group is su(3 ) . to be able to apply the color - flavor transformation to this very important physical case , a variant of the transformation for the special unitary group needed to be derived . following earlier work by budczies and shnir  @xcite ,",
    "this was done in refs .",
    "@xcite in the fermionic sector , i.e. for @xmath9 .",
    "the result was then applied to lattice qcd in refs .",
    "@xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", the color - flavor transformation can only be applied to the one - link integral of lattice gauge theory if the gauge coupling is infinite .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to go beyond the infinite - coupling limit .",
    "a gauge action ( yang - mills action in the continuum or wilson action on the lattice ) can be induced by coupling auxiliary fields to the gauge field ( still at infinite coupling ) and integrating out these extra fields .",
    "this idea , which is known as `` induced qcd '' , has been considered in various forms in the literature @xcite .",
    "for example , the job can be done by a number @xmath10 of heavy auxiliary fermions with common mass @xmath11 in the combined limit @xmath12 , @xmath13 such that the ratio @xmath14 is constant , and this constant can then be related to the strength of the induced gauge coupling .",
    "so far , the color - flavor transformation for su@xmath0 has only been derived in the fermionic sector , for three reasons : ( a ) physical quarks are fermions , ( b ) a gauge action can be induced by auxiliary fermions alone , and ( c ) the calculation is somewhat easier for fermions than for bosons",
    ". there seemed to be no special need for a bosonic variant of the transformation until budczies and zirnbauer suggested a new method to induce the gauge action using auxiliary bosons  @xcite .",
    "their approach has the advantage of requiring only a small number ( essentially equal to @xmath4 ) of auxiliary fields .",
    "however , to be able to use their method in lattice qcd , one requires an su(@xmath4)-variant of the color - flavor transformation that accommodates both fermions ( the physical quarks ) and bosons ( to induce the gauge action ) .    as a first step towards this goal",
    ", we found it useful to consider the purely bosonic case with @xmath15 for which we will present results in this paper .",
    "our results can be applied to study a boson - induced gauge theory without physical quarks .",
    "the concentration on the bosonic sector allows us to separate the complications due to the fact that the fields are bosonic from those due to the supersymmetric framework .",
    "this is the main motivation for the present paper .",
    "the supersymmetric case will be addressed in a separate publication .",
    "the convergence requirement mentioned above is irrelevant for the purely fermionic case in which @xmath9 since the inequality is always satisfied .",
    "however , it becomes relevant for the purely bosonic case .",
    "we obtain a `` standard '' form of the color - flavor transformation if the condition @xmath2 is satisfied . in the extended range @xmath3",
    "we derive a different form of the transformation .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath16 our results for su(@xmath4 ) are identical to those for gauge group u(@xmath4 ) , and we therefore obtain new results for u(@xmath4 ) in the range @xmath17 . for @xmath18",
    "we have not been able to simplify our formal result to be useful in applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first state our results in sec .  [",

    "the corresponding invariant integration measure is given by @xcite @xmath39    note that the @xmath40 matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be thought of as products of three matrices of dimension @xmath41 , @xmath35 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the resulting matrix is of full rank only if @xmath43 . for @xmath16",
    ", we therefore have @xmath44 @xcite , and the transformation simplifies to @xmath45 with a constant @xmath46 given in eq .  .",
    "this agrees with the result for the color group u(@xmath4 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "equation   looks similar to the result for the fermionic sector presented in ref .",
    "there are two major differences , however .",
    "first , due to the nilpotency of grassmann variables the sum over @xmath47 in eq .   only went up to @xmath6 in the fermionic case , whereas it extends to infinity now .",
    "second , the invariant measure of the coset space @xmath48 $ ] in eq",
    ".   diverges at the boundary , giving rise to convergence issues which we discuss now .    for @xmath2 ,",
    "the divergence of the measure is canceled by the factor of @xmath49 in the integrand of eq .  .",
    "in this case the result applies and is free from divergences . for @xmath17 , the integral over @xmath36 in eq .   diverges . for @xmath50 , the integral over @xmath36 in eq",
    ".   diverges for @xmath51 , whereas for @xmath18 , it diverges for all @xmath47 . of course",
    ", the final result for the rhs of eqs .   and must be finite , so whatever divergence arises from the integration over @xmath36 will be canceled by a similar divergence in the integral for the corresponding ( inverse ) constant @xmath52 , see eq .  .",
    "a finite ratio could in principle be obtained by a limiting procedure , but it is not clear to us whether this would lead to a simple final result .    instead , we have used the character expansion method  @xcite to derive a different form of the color - flavor transformation and obtain for @xmath16 @xmath53 where the @xmath35 matrix @xmath54 is defined by @xmath55 .",
    "note that the integration on the rhs is over the unitary group with the normalized haar measure @xmath56 .",
    "equation   is also valid if the integration on the lhs is over the color group u(@xmath4 ) and , to the best of our knowledge , represents a new result for this case .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , for @xmath18 we have not been able to obtain a simple form of the color - flavor transformation in which the divergences have been eliminated .",
    "the basic idea of the algebraic approach to the color - flavor transformation is to construct two projection operators onto the subspace of fock space ( to be defined below ) which is invariant under the action of the color group @xmath64 .",
    "one such projector is implemented by integrating over the color group .",
    "the other one is obtained by integrating over a certain coset of the flavor group u(@xmath65 ) .",
    "identification of the two projection operations then leads to eq .  .",
    "in this section , we shall use this algebraic approach to derive the bosonic color - flavor transformation .",
    "we closely follow refs .",
    "@xcite whenever possible .",
    "we introduce two sets of bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . as mentioned above",
    ", we shall refer to the upper index as `` color '' and to the lower index as `` flavor '' .",
    "the fock vacuum @xmath70 is defined by the requirement that @xmath71 for all combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the fock space is generated by acting on @xmath70 with the @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the following , the two sets of particles created by the @xmath72 and @xmath73 will be refered to as particles and antiparticles , respectively .    for simplicity of notation",

    "the lie algebra @xmath80 has two commuting subalgebras that are important for our proof , namely @xmath81 , which is generated by the color - singlet operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which is generated by the flavor - singlet operators @xmath84 note that only @xmath85 of the generators @xmath86 are linearly independent .",
    "the action of the group gl@xmath87 and its subgroups on the fock space is defined by exponential mapping , i.e. for all @xmath88 we define a map @xmath89 from group elements to operators by  @xcite @xmath90\\:.\\ ] ] following zirnbauer  @xcite , one can show that the map @xmath89 is well - defined and a homomorphism of gl@xmath87 , @xmath91 therefore it furnishes a ( reducible ) representation of gl@xmath87 .    in the following , we will consider the action of the subgroups su(@xmath4 ) ( the color group ) and u(@xmath65 ) ( the flavor group ) of gl@xmath87 on the fock space .",
    "the corresponding subalgebras @xmath83 and @xmath92 have been given above .",
    "what are the reasons to single out these two subgroups ? for the color group the reason is simple : the integration on the lhs of eq .",
    "is over su(@xmath4 ) . for the flavor group ,",
    "the choice of the non - compact subgroup u(@xmath65 ) is not immediately obvious at this point but will become clear as we proceed .",
    "we shall see below that the color - neutral sector of fock space is non - compact in the bosonic case , as opposed to the fermionic case in which it was compact .",
    "attempts to work with the compact subgroup u(@xmath93 ) do not lead to useful results . also , when eq .   is used in applications , one wants the resulting integrals over the bosonic variables to converge , and this requirement necessitates a non - compact integration domain on the rhs of that equation  @xcite .    under the action of the subgroups su(@xmath4 ) and u(@xmath65 ) , the operators @xmath94 and @xmath95 transform as follows , @xmath96 which can be shown using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula .",
    "we call a vector @xmath97 in the fock space color - neutral if it is invariant under su(@xmath4 ) transformations , i.e. @xmath98 for all @xmath99",
    ". the subspace of fock space spanned by these invariant vectors is called the color - neutral subspace or sector .    the following argument closely parallels ref .  @xcite . with the complex bosonic variables",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath100 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , bose coherent states are defined as @xmath101 they span the entire fock space ( or its dual ) . using eq .",
    "we find @xmath102 the lhs of eq .",
    "can therefore be written as @xmath103 where we have introduced the operator @xmath104 defined by @xmath105 this operator annihilates all states that are not color - neutral , while leaving color - neutral states invariant ( recall that the volume of su(@xmath4 ) is unity ) .",
    "therefore , it is a projector onto the color - neutral sector .",
    "as advertised above , it is one possible representation of such a projector , and we will now derive an alternative form .      by definition ,",
    "color - neutral vectors @xmath97 are annihilated by all generators of sl(@xmath4 ) , i.e. @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "using eq .   and the commutation relations , this requirement leads to @xmath108 where @xmath47 is an integer .",
    "clearly , the color - neutral sector contains the vacuum .",
    "for @xmath109 , the operator on the lhs of eq .",
    "counts the difference in the number of particles and antiparticles for each color , the difference being equal to @xmath47 .",
    "the color - neutral sector can be generated by acting on the vacuum state with three types of operators , @xmath110 when acting on a color - neutral state , type-1 operators do not change the @xmath47-value of that state , whereas type-2a ( type-2b ) operators increase ( decrease ) the @xmath47-value by one .",
    "note , however , that for @xmath16 the type-2 operators do not exist , which makes it impossible to generate a vector in a non - zero @xmath47-sector .",
    "the range of @xmath47 is therefore given by @xmath111 ( in the case of @xmath16 , we are back to the bosonic color - flavor transformation for the group @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "the lie algebra of u(@xmath4 ) has an extra @xmath113 generator , and by requiring invariance under @xmath114 , this @xmath113 generator eliminates all non - zero @xmath47-sectors . )    the action of the flavor group on the fock space is defined by eq .   with @xmath115 .",
    "we now choose the color - neutral sector to be the carrier space of this representation .",
    "the type-1 operators are the generators of the flavor group and do not change the @xmath47-value of a given state .",
    "therefore , under the action of the flavor group , the color - neutral sector decomposes into invariant subspaces labeled by @xmath47 , which we shall call `` @xmath47-sectors '' .",
    "as mentioned above , a @xmath47-sector contains @xmath47 more particles than antiparticles for each color .",
    "we now proof that the flavor group acts irreducibly in a given @xmath47-sector  @xcite . for this",
    "we need to show that from any given state in the @xmath47-sector we can reach any other state by the action of the flavor group .",
    "equivalently , we can single out a particular state @xmath116 , defined by @xmath117 and show that ( i ) starting from this state , we can reach any other state , and ( ii ) from that state we can return to @xmath116 , using type-1 operators only .    an arbitrary vector in a given @xmath47-sector , which we should be able to reach from @xmath116 , is obtained by acting on the vacuum with the appropriate number of type-1a operators and @xmath47 more type-2a than type-2b operators .",
    "there are already @xmath47 ( @xmath118 ) unpaired type-2a ( type-2b ) operators associated with @xmath116 , so what remains are pairs consisting of a type-2a and a type-2b operator . such a pair can be expanded in terms of type-1a operators as @xmath119 and is therefore in the algebra of the flavor group .",
    "the type-1c and type-1d operators obey the commutation relations @xmath120    & = \\epsilon_{i_1 \\cdots i_{n_c}}{\\bar      c}^{i_1}_{a}{\\bar c}^{i_2}_{b_2}\\cdots{\\bar c}^{i_{n_c}}_{b_{n_c}}\\ : , { \\notag}\\\\    [ d^i_{b_1}{\\bar d}^i_a , \\epsilon_{i_1 \\cdots i_{n_c}}{\\bar      d}^{i_1}_{b_1}{\\bar d}^{i_2}_{b_2}\\cdots{\\bar d}^{i_{n_c}}_{b_{n_c } } ]    & = \\epsilon_{i_1 \\cdots i_{n_c}}{\\bar      d}^{i_1}_{a}{\\bar d}^{i_2}_{b_2}\\cdots{\\bar d}^{i_{n_c}}_{b_{n_c}}\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , they enable us to change the flavor indices of the type-2 operators .",
    "we can thus reach any state in a given @xmath47-sector by acting with the corresponding number and subtypes of type-1 operators on @xmath116 .",
    "furthermore , type-1a operators can be undone by type-1b operators , while type-1c and type-1d operators can undo themselves .",
    "we can therefore go from an arbitrary state in the @xmath47-sector back to @xmath116 .",
    "in other words , @xmath116 is a cyclic vector in the @xmath47-sector under the action of the flavor group , which implies irreducibility .",
    "generalized coherent states are described in detail in ref .",
    "they are useful for our purposes because they allow a resolution of the identity operator . for a lie group @xmath121 and an irreducible representation @xmath122 , a set of generalized coherent states",
    "is obtained by acting on a state @xmath123 in the carrier space of @xmath122 with all elements of @xmath122 .",
