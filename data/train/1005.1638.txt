    "the evolution of the cosmic matter density field and large - scale structure ( lss ) can be affected by a finite neutrino mass @xcite . for example , when the velocities of finite - mass neutrinos are large , the growth of density fluctuations will be impeded @xcite on the scale of neutrino free - streaming .",
    "cosmological constraints on the neutrino mass are thus of considerable interest .",
    "recently an upper limit to the neutrino mass of order @xmath1 ev has been deduced from a combination of tritium beta - decay endpoint experiments @xcite and cosmological observations @xcite .    at the same time , magnetic fields have been observed @xcite in clusters of galaxies with a strength of @xmath2 g. one possible explanation for such magnetic fields in galactic clusters is the existence of a primordial magnetic field ( pmf ) of order 1 ng whose field lines collapsed as the cluster formed .",
    "a variety of mechanisms for the origin and amplification of a pmf on the scale of galaxy clusters havs been proposed @xcite and the associated pmf could have influenced a variety of phenomena in the early universe @xcite such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , and the formation of lss @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance to the present work is the fact that the effects of a finite neutrino mass on the matter density fluctuations are degenerate with the effects of a pmf .",
    "therefore , these two effects must be constrained together when using the fluctuations of the matter density to find limits on the neutrino mass and the pmf parameters .    in this regard ,",
    "the alternative normalization parameter @xmath0 is of particular interest as a measure of large - scale structure effects .",
    "it is defined @xcite as the root mean square of the matter density fluctuations in a comoving sphere of radius @xmath3 mpc .",
    "it is determined by a weighted integral of the matter power spectrum .",
    "observations which determine @xmath0 provide information about the physical processes affecting the evolution of density - field fluctuations and the formation of structure on cosmological scales .    the detailed mechanisms by which a pmf can affect the density field fluctuations on cosmological scales has been described in refs.@xcite .",
    "of course , @xmath0 is also affected by the presence of a pmf .",
    "indeed , in @xcite we demonstrated for the first time that there was a degeneracy between the parameters of the pmf and the neutrino mass .    in this article , we expand on our previous work @xcite by also considering the influence on the matter contributions @xcite . by considering the effects of a pmf and finite - mass neutrinos on @xmath0 and comparing",
    "theoretically deduced values for @xmath0 with the observed range , we obtain not only insight into the underlying physical processes of density field fluctuations in the presence of a pmf , but also show that the constraint on the sum of neutrino masses from @xmath0 changes when the effects of a pmf are included .",
    "to evolve the primary density perturbations in the presence of a pmf we begin with magnetized isocurvature initial conditions for the fluids .",
    "for the present purposes we also fix the cosmological parameters to those of the best - fit flat @xmath4cdm model as given in the wmap 5 yr analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the baryon and cold dark matter densities in units of the critical density , @xmath12 is the spectral index of the primordial scalar fluctuations , @xmath13 is the hubble parameter in units of km s@xmath14mpc@xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the optical depth for compton scattering .",
    "the ionized baryons and electrons are influenced by lorentz forces when a pmf is present .",
    "photons are then indirectly affected by the pmf through thomson scattering before the epoch of photon last scattering .",
    "we assume that the pmf was generated earlier during the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "we use a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background cosmology for the linear perturbations . for the time evolution",
    "we treat the energy density of the pmf as a first - order perturbation and a stiff source .",
    "therefore , all back reactions from the fluid can be discarded .",
    "we also assume that the conductivity of the primordial plasma is very large and that the electric field is negligible , i.e.  @xmath16",
    "frozen - in  condition is a very good approximation @xcite . on very large scales the time evolution of the pmf can be decoupled from its spatial dependence , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to the following simplified electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor : @xmath18}(\\mathbf{x},\\tau)=\\frac{b(\\mathbf{x})^2}{8\\pi a^6 } \\label{eq_mst_00}~~ , \\\\ { t^{i0}}_{[\\mathrm{em}]}(\\mathbf{x},\\tau)={t^{0k}}_{[\\mathrm{em}]}(\\mathbf{x},\\tau)=0 \\label{eq_mst_0s } ~~,\\\\ -{t^{ik}}_{[\\mathrm{em}]}(\\mathbf{x},\\tau)=\\sigma^{ik}_\\mathrm{b}= \\frac{1}{8\\pi a^6}\\left\\ {      2b^i(\\mathbf{x } ) b^k(\\mathbf{x } ) - \\delta^{ik}b(\\mathbf{x})^2 \\right\\}~~ , \\label{eq_mst_ss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use natural units @xmath19",
    ". for a pmf that is statistically homogeneous , isotropic and random , the fluctuation power spectrum can be parametrized as a power - law @xmath20 @xcite where @xmath21 is the spectral index .",
    "a two - point correlation function for the pmf can be defined @xcite by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the strength of the magnetic comoving mean - field derived by smoothing over a gaussian sphere of comoving radius @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 mpc in this paper ) , and @xmath27 there is a natural cutoff wave number @xmath28 in the magnetic power spectrum which is dependent upon the damping scale of the pmf by radiative viscosity .",
    "it is defined in refs .",
    "hereafter , we work in k - space and denote all quantities by their fourier transform convention @xmath29    we evaluate the pmf source power spectrum using the numerical methods described in refs .  @xcite . using this",
    ", we can quantitatively evaluate the time evolution of the cut off scale and thereby more reliably calculate the effects of a pmf .",
    "we adopt the model of ref.@xcite for estimating the effects of finite - mass neutrinos and the pmf on fluctuations of the matter density fields in the early universe .",
    "we also utilize adiabatic initial conditions for the matter contributions as in ref.@xcite .",
    "this leads to stable numerical calculations of the curvature perturbation of the scalar mode for all scales and times .",
    "this is an improvement over previous numerical estimations for which the scalar curvature perturbations were too small to stabilize numerical calculations for large scales and early times .",
    "thus , we can obtain consistent results for all scales and times of interest in the present work .",
    "details of the effects of a pmf on the cosmological density field fluctuations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly review these effects and show that a relation exists between @xmath0 and the pmf parameters .",
    "the observational constraints @xcite on @xmath0 , therefore , lead to a strong constraint on the pmf parameters and the neutrino mass .",
    "since the parameters of the pmf have a strong degeneracy , the existence of a bayesian prior constraint on @xmath0 can be used to effectively constrain the pmf .",
    "also , since @xmath0 is constrained by diverse observational data on linear cosmological scales , we can obtain a reliable prior for use in determining the probability distributions for the parameters of the pmf from cmb observations .",
    "the pmf effects dominate the matter power spectrum for wave numbers @xmath30 mpc@xmath14@xcite(fig.1 ) .",
    "this is because the pmf energy density fluctuations depend only on the scale factor @xmath31 and can survive below the silk damping scale .",
    "therefore , the pmf continues to be a source for the fluctuations via the lorentz force even below the silk damping scale . in the case of no correlation between the pmf and the matter density fluctuations ,",
    "the matter power spectrum is increased by the pmf independently of whether the pmf is dominated by the pressure or the magnetic tension@xcite .",
    "a pmf affects the power spectrum function @xmath32 and the matter density fluctuation @xmath33 differently .",
    "the total density fluctuation @xmath33 can be smaller or larger depending on whether the effect of the pmf is mainly due to its pressure or tension .",
    "on the other hand , the power spectrum function @xmath32 always increases in the case that the pmf does not correlate with the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "this is because @xmath34 and is not affected by the sign of @xmath33 .",
    "the alternative normalization parameter @xmath0 can be determined from a study of the physical processes of density field fluctuations on cosmological scales within the linear regime .",
    "recently @xmath0 has been constrained in this way by observations @xcite to be in the range @xmath35 . from this",
    "we can obtain strong constraints on the pmf parameters by numerically calculating @xmath0 under the influence of a pmf .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the possible discrepancy between theoretical estimates and observational temperature fluctuations of the cmb for higher multipoles ( @xmath36 ) could be attributed to a pmf of comoving strength 1.0 ng@xmath372.0ng . since other constraints on the amplitude of the pmf",
    "imply @xmath3810 ng@xcite , our allowed range is consistent with previous works .",
    "the value of @xmath0 derived by a cmb analysis including such a field strength for the pmf is also @xmath39 .",
    "as noted above , in this work we consider @xmath0 constraints from both fits to the cmb and from large - scale structure . in this case",
    ", we adopt a prior for @xmath0 in the range of 0.75@xmath400.85 as a reasonable average of constraints from observed structure and fits to the cmb .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the constraints on the pmf parameter @xmath41 and the sum of neutrino masses @xmath42 for various fixed values of @xmath21 and ranges of @xmath0 as labeled .",
    "since the pmf power spectrum depends on @xmath21 , pmf effects on the density fluctuations for small scales decrease with lower values for @xmath21 . based upon previous work @xcite the upper limit on the total neutrino mass",
    "is expected to be of order @xmath1 ev . for such masses",
    "the neutrino velocities can be quite large while the mass density of neutrinos is still a significant fraction of the total dark matter density .",
    "therefore , the growth of density fluctuations on the free - streaming scale of neutrinos will be hindered .",
    "thus , neutrinos decrease the matter density fluctuations , while a pmf increases the matter density fluctuations ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath21 within the ranges constrained by previous work @xcite , a pmf with @xmath43 ng affects the matter density fluctuations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . when the mass of the neutrinos is constrained from matter density fluctuations in the presence of a pmf , the deduced upper limit is heavier with a pmf than without .",
    "the expected parameters of the pmf from the combined analysis of the cmb and observed magnetic fields in galactic clusters is @xmath442.0ng@xmath45 and @xmath463.0ng@xmath47 @xcite , while the expected value of @xmath0 based upon observations is 0.75@xmath400.85 as noted above .",
    "for this range of @xmath0 , the sum of the neutrino masses is constrained to be @xmath48 ev ( from the 1@xmath49 constraint on @xmath41 ) and @xmath50ev ( from the 2@xmath49 constraint on @xmath41 ) for @xmath51 .",
    "this is a larger upper limit than that deduced previously because the effect of the pmf cancels the effect of neutrinos on the density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "komatsu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) noted that the effect of a finite neutrino mass is very small for the detection range of the wmap , e.g. @xmath52@xcite .",
    "therefore , as a first step toward constraining the neutrino mass together with the pmf we can use the wmap cmb power spectrum for @xmath52 to obtain values for the primary cosmological parameters without concern for a degeneracy between these parameters and the neutrino mass .",
    "one can not constrain the mass of neutrinos very well from such cmb data alone . hence , one must use other observational data which are independent of the cmb analysis to constrain the neutrino mass . for this purpose , @xmath0 is very useful since it is determined from independent observations of lss in the regime of linear perturbation theory .",
    "since the main purpose of the present work is to examine how the upper limit of the neutrino mass determined from @xmath0 changes when a pmf is included , we have focused on a theoretical analyses of effects of both the pmf and the neutrino mass on @xmath0 and the matter power spectrum . however , theoretical estimates of @xmath0 depend upon the cosmological model employed and @xmath0 has a significant degeneracy with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , even if such primary parameters are well constrained by the cmb data , e.g. wmap@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is the degeneracy between the mass of neutrinos and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should ultimately consider the degeneracy between the pmf and other cosmological parameters including the mass of neutrinos . in subsequent work",
    "we will carry out a full - constraint on the mass of neutrinos using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method applied to both the cmb and the lss data .",
    "in that effort we will need to consider the model dependence and degeneracy between cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass and pmf parameters .",
    "previous numerical estimates of curvature perturbations without matter contributions were too small at early times to stabilize on large scales . in the present work",
    "we have stabilized the time evolution of curvature perturbations in the presence of a pmf while considering the matter contributions .",
    "we find that a pmf significantly affects the constraint on the sum of neutrino masses .",
    "we confirm that the upper limit on the neutrino mass from @xmath0 in the presence of a pmf is heavier than without a pmf even if we consider the matter contributions .",
    "we also have shown that the prior limited range on the sum of neutrino masses and pmf parameters is within the expected range for @xmath0 from observations of the lss .",
    "since the sum of the neutrino masses has a degeneracy with some of the cosmological parameters , e.g. @xmath56 , one should ultimately utilize a more complete mcmc method with the cmb and lss data to resolve such degeneracies and obtain a more accurate constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses .",
    "constraints on the pmf parameters and @xmath0 are soon to be improved by future cosmological observational programs such as quiet , planck , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . in principle , by applying our method to such data it will be possible to obtain not only the upper but also the lower limits to the neutrino mass from cosmology in the presence of a pmf .",
