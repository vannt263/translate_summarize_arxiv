    "since the beginning of lattice gauge theory the regularization of chiral fermions has been afflicted with severe problems . when regulating fermions on a lattice , typically , unwanted doublers with opposite chirality appear .",
    "these doublers can be lifted ( given mass of the order of the cut - off ) at the cost of explicitly breaking chiral symmetry , as in the wilson fermion formulation .",
    "alternatively , a remnant of chiral symmetry can be retained , with a smaller number of doublers interpreted as flavors , as in the staggered fermion formalism . however , at finite lattice spacing the flavor symmetry is broken .",
    "both these approaches fail from the outset for regulating weyl fermions .",
    "the central problem in the non - perturbative regularization of gauge theories with weyl fermions is to write down a formula for the fermionic determinant when the fermion is in some complex representation of the gauge group , since depending on the topology of the gauge field the chiral dirac operator can be square or rectangular , where the difference between rows and columns is the index .",
    "significant progress in the formulation of chiral gauge theories has been made by the overlap formalism  @xcite .",
    "the overlap formalism was inspired by two papers  @xcite .",
    "the central idea is that an infinite number of dirac fermions ( labeled by @xmath0 ) with a mass term of the form @xmath1 and chiral projectors @xmath2 can be used to regulate a single weyl fermion if the infinite dimensional mass matrix @xmath3 has a single zero mode but @xmath4 has no zero modes .",
    "paper  @xcite uses this idea to put chiral fermions on the lattice where they are referred to as domain wall fermions since kaplan used a mass matrix that has a domain wall like structure . in the overlap formalism",
    "the infinite number of dirac fermions is described by two non - interacting many body hamiltonians , one for each side of the domain wall , and the chiral determinant is written as the overlap between their groundstates @xmath5 @xmath6 is the many body ground state of @xmath7 and @xmath8 the many body ground state of @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the usual wilson - dirac operator on the lattice with a fermion mass in the supercritical region ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are canonical fermion annihilation ( creation ) operators . on a finite lattice ,",
    "the single particle hamiltonians are finite matrices of size @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume of the lattice , @xmath17 is the size of the particular representation of the gauge group and @xmath18 is the number of components of a weyl spinor .",
    "then @xmath19 is made up of @xmath20 particles .",
    "if @xmath21 is also made up of @xmath20 particles , then the overlap is not zero in the generic case .",
    "if the background gauge field is such that there are only @xmath22 negative energy states for @xmath23 then the overlap is zero .",
    "any small perturbation of the gauge field will not alter this situation .",
    "furthermore , the overlap @xmath24 will not be zero in the generic case if the fermion is in the fundamental representation of the gauge group showing that there is a violation of fermion number by @xmath25 units .",
    "so , clearly , the overlap definition of the chiral determinant ( [ eq : detc ] ) has the desired properties .",
    "a generic problem with simulations of chiral gauge theories is that the chiral fermion determinant is complex .",
    "a `` brute force approach '' is feasible in the simulation of two dimensional models , and in this way the overlap formalism has successfully reproduced non - trivial results in two dimensional chiral models on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the brute force approach , however , is clearly not feasible in four dimensions , where efficient numerical techniques are essential .",
    "this prevented simulations of chiral gauge theories and tests of the overlap formalism in four dimensions so far .    clearly , any formulation of lattice chiral gauge theories is also a formulation of massless vector gauge theories with an exact chiral symmetry and a positive fermion determinant ( the product of the chiral determinant for the left handed fermions and its complex conjugate for the right handed ones ) .",
    "lattice qcd using the overlap formalism reproduces the well - known mass inequalities between mesons and baryons , and the @xmath26 symmetry in an @xmath27 flavor theory is broken down to @xmath28 by gauge fields that carry topological charge  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath29 symmetry is spontaneously broken , then massless goldstone bosons should naturally emerge in the overlap formalism . since the symmetry breaking pattern is exactly as in the continuum , all the soft pion theorems should hold on the lattice as well .    for a vector gauge theory the computation of the fermionic determinant can be simplified significantly compared to the original version ( [ eq : detc ] ) that involves the computation of the overlap of two many body ground states .",
    "one way to derive the simplified expression is to start with the variant of domain wall fermions of ref .",
    "@xcite , applicable for a vector gauge theory .",
    "we choose this approach here to emphasize the close connection between domain wall and overlap fermions . integrating out all the fermion and pauli - villars fields , neuberger derived the following expression for the determinant describing a single light dirac fermion  @xcite @xmath30 \\right\\ } .",

    "\\label{eq : detdw}\\ ] ] it is only in this limit that massless domain wall fermions have an exact chiral symmetry . finally , taking the lattice spacing , @xmath38 , in the extra direction to zero one obtains the overlap - dirac operator of neuberger  @xcite @xmath39 .",

    "@xmath21 is the many body ground state of @xmath58 .",
    "this establishes a one - to - one correspondence between the overlap formula and the determinant of a fermionic operator satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation for massless vector gauge theories .",
    "in order to compute the action of @xmath60 on a vector one can proceed in several different ways .",
    "since we are interested in working in four dimensions , it is not practical to store the whole matrix @xmath61 . therefore standard techniques to deal with the square root of a matrix  @xcite will not be discussed .",

    "such techniques have been developed to solve linear systems with fractional powers of a positive definite operator using gegenbauer polynomials  @xcite and applied to the overlap - dirac operator in @xcite .",

    "the maximum deviation from unity is equal to @xmath86 .",
    "this range will increase if one increases the order of the approximation .",
    "for the current applications we found this range to be sufficient .",
    "the approximation to @xmath59 by poles involves a multi - shift inner conjugate gradient and therefore it seems necessary to store @xmath17 vectors where @xmath17 is the order of the approximation .",
    "one can avoid storing the extra vectors if one is willing to perform two passes of the inner conjugate gradient  @xcite .",
    "a lanczos based algorithm that also avoids this extra storage by requiring two passes has been proposed , but it involves an explicit diagonalization of a tridiagonal matrix  @xcite . in this method @xmath61",
    "is approximated by a small dimensional tridiagonal matrix ( anywhere between @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) and @xmath59 is computed by first diagonalizing the tridiagonal matrix and then performing the trivial operation of @xmath89 on the eigenvalues .",

    "[ fig : rho0_scale_use ] we show the density of ( near ) zero eigenvalues for @xmath93 .",
    "we see that while @xmath94 decreases rapidly as @xmath95 increases , it does not appear to go zero at a finite lattice spacing .",
    "the second part of figure  [ fig : rho0_scale_use ] emphasizes that @xmath94 decreases exponentially in some power of @xmath96 ( the power here is not well determined , but reasonably fits @xmath97 ) .",
    "this result implies that on a specific gauge background , @xmath61 could have an arbitrarily large condition number due to a few small eigenvalues .",

    "we should choose the scale so that the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath100 is not above the range where the approximation is deemed good .",
    "having so chosen a value for @xmath0 , we need to deal with the low lying eigenvalues that fall outside the range of the approximation to @xmath59 .",
    "we do this by computing a few low lying eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath61 , for which we then know the contribution to @xmath59 exactly , and projecting them out before applying the approximation to the orthogonal subspace for which the approximation is good .",
    "the number of eigenvalues that have to be projected out will depend on the lattice coupling , the lattice size and the lower end of the range of the approximation .",
    "it will roughly increase with the volume at a fixed coupling making it difficult to go to large lattice volumes at strong coupling .",
    "however , the number of eigenvalues that have to be projected out will decrease as one goes to weaker coupling even at a fixed physical volume .",
    "this is because the density of eigenvalues of @xmath61 near zero goes to zero as one goes to the continuum limit  @xcite .",

    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is an important feature of qcd .",
