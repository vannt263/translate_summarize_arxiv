    "the astonishing amount of information available on the web and the highly variable quality of its content generate the need for an absolute measure of importance for web pages , that can be used to improve the performance of web search .",
    "link analysis algorithms such as the celebrated _ pagerank _ , try to answer this need by using the link structure of the web to assign authoritative weights to the pages  @xcite .",
    "pagerank s approach is based on the assumption that links convey human endorsement .",
    "for example , the existence of a link from page @xmath0 to page @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ tiny_web](a ) is seen as a testimonial of the importance of page @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the amount of importance conferred to page @xmath1 is proportional to the importance of page @xmath0 and inversely proportional to the number of pages @xmath0 links to . in their original paper ,",
    "page et al .",
    "@xcite imagined of a _ random surfer _ who , with probability @xmath2 follows the links of a web page , and with probability @xmath3 jumps to a different page uniformly at random .",
    "then , following this metaphor , the overall importance of a page was defined to be equal to the fraction of time this random surfer spends on it , in the long run .    formulating pagerank s basic idea with a mathematical model ,",
    "involves viewing the web as a directed graph with web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges . given this graph",
    ", we can construct a _ row - normalized hyperlink matrix _ @xmath4 , whose element @xmath5_{uv}$ ] is one over the outdegree of @xmath6 if there is a link from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , or zero otherwise .",
    "the matter of dangling nodes is fixed with some sort of stochasticity adjustment , thereby transforming the initial matrix @xmath4 , to a stochastic matrix .",
    "a second adjustment is needed to certify that the final matrix is irreducible and aperiodic , so that it possesses a unique positive stationary probability distribution .",
    "that is ensured by the introduction of the _ damping factor _ @xmath2 and a _ teleportation _",
    "matrix @xmath8 , usually defined by @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting matrix is given by : @xmath10 pagerank vector is the unique stationary distribution of the markov chain corresponding to matrix @xmath11 .",
    "the choice of the damping factor has received much attention since it determines the fraction of the importance of a node that is propagated through the edges rather than scattered throughout the graph via the teleportation matrix .",
    "obviously , picking a very small damping factor ignores the link structure of the graph and results in uninformative ranking vectors . on the other hand , setting the damping factor very close to one , causes a number of serious problems .",
    "from a computational perspective , as @xmath12 , the number of iterations till convergence to the pagerank vector grows prohibitively , and also makes the computation of the rankings numerically ill - conditioned  @xcite .",
    "moreover , from a qualitative point of view , various studies indicate that damping factors close to 1 result into counterintuitive ranking vectors where all the pagerank gets concentrated mostly in irrelevant nodes , while the web s core component is assigned null rank  @xcite .",
    "finally , the very existence of the damping factor and the related teleportation matrix `` opens the door '' to direct manipulation of the ranking score through link spamming  @xcite .    in the literature there",
    "have been proposed several ranking methods that try to address these issues .",
    "boldi  @xcite proposed an algorithm that eliminates pagerank s dependency on the arbitrarily chosen parameter @xmath2 by integrating the ranking vector over the entire range of possible damping factors .",
    "baeza - yates et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a family of link - based ranking algorithms parametrised by the selection of a damping function that describes how rapidly the importance of paths decays as the path length increases .",
    "constantine and gleich  @xcite proposed a ranking method that considers the influence of a population of random surfers , each choosing its own damping factor from a probability distribution .",
    "all the above methods attack the problem from the damping factor point of view , while taking the teleportation matrix as granted .",
    "nikolakopoulos and garofalakis  @xcite , on the other hand , focus on the teleportation model itself .",
    "building on the intuition behind nearly decomposable systems  @xcite , the authors proposed _",
    "ncdawarerank _ ; a novel ranking framework that generalizes and refines pagerank by enriching the teleportation model in a computationally efficient way .",
    "ncdawarerank decomposes the underlying space into ncd blocks , and uses these blocks to define indirect relations between the nodes in the graph ( fig .",
    "[ tiny_web](b ) ) which lead to the introduction of a new inter - level proximity component .",
    "a comprehensive set of experiments done by the authors using real snapshots of the web graph showed that the introduction of this decomposition alleviates the negative effects of uniform teleportation and produces ranking vectors that display low sensitivity to sparsity and , at the same time , exhibit resistance to direct manipulation through link spamming ( see the discussion in sections 4.2 and 4.3 in  @xcite for further details ) .",
    "however , albeit reducing some of its negative effects , ncdawarerank model also includes the standard teleportation matrix as a purely mathematical necessity .",
    "but , is it ?",
    "the main questions we try to address in this work are the following : _ is it possible to discard the uniform teleportation altogether ? and if so , under which conditions ? _",
    "thankfully , the answer is yes . in particular , we show that , the definition of the ncd blocks , can be enough to ensure the production of well - defined ranking vectors without resorting to uniform teleportation . the criterion for this to be true",
    "is expressed solely in term of properties of the proposed decomposition , which makes it very easy to check and at the same time gives insight that can lead to better decompositions for the particular ranking problems under consideration .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : after discussing ncdawarerank model ( section  [ sec : ncdawarerank ] ) we derive sufficient and necessary conditions under which the inter - level proximity matrix enables us to discard the teleportation matrix completely ( section  [ subsec : primitivity ] ) . in section  [ sec_overlapping ] , we generalize ncdawarerank model , in order to allow the definition of overlapping blocks without compromising its theoretical and computational properties .",

    "( i.e. @xmath126 ) it suffices to show that whenever matrix @xmath88 is reducible , matrix @xmath17 is also reducible ( and thus , not primitive @xcite ) .",
    "first observe that when matrix @xmath88 is reducible the same holds for matrix @xmath43 .",
    "the reducibility of the indicator matrix @xmath88 implies the reducibility of the inter - level proximity matrix @xmath43 .",
    "concretely , @xmath127    assume that matrix @xmath88 is reducible .",
    "then , there exists a permutation matrix @xmath128 such that @xmath129 has the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 are square matrices  @xcite .",
    "notice that a similar block upper triangular form can be then achieved for matrix @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , the existence of the block zero matrix in  ( [ rel : blockupperdiagonal ] ) , together with the definition of matrices @xmath90 ensures the existence of a set of blocks , that have the property none of their including nodes to have outgoing edges to the rest of the nodes in the graph .",
    "thus , organizing the rows and columns of matrix @xmath43 such that these nodes are assigned the last indices , results in a matrix @xmath43 that has a similarly block upper triangular form .",
    "this makes @xmath43 reducible too .",
    "thus , we only need to show that the reducibility of matrix @xmath43 implies the reducibility of matrix @xmath17 also",

    "this makes matrix @xmath17 reducible and hence non - primitive .",
    "therefore , we have shown that @xmath132 , which is equivalent to @xmath133 putting everything together , we see that both directions of our theorem have been established . thus we get , @xmath134 and our proof is complete .",
    "now , when the stochastic matrix @xmath17 is primitive , from the perron - frobenius theorem it follows that its largest eigenvalue  which is equal to 1  is unique and it can be associated with strictly positive left and right eigenvectors .",
    "therefore , under the conditions of theorem  [ theorem : primitivityconditions ] , the ranking vector produced by the ncdawarerank model  which is defined to be the stationary distribution of the stochastic matrix @xmath17 : ( a ) is uniquely determined as the ( normalized ) left eigenvector of @xmath17 that corresponds to the eigenvalue 1 and , ( b ) its support includes every node in the underlying graph .",
    "the following corollary , summarizes the result .    when the indicator matrix @xmath88 is irreducible , the ranking vector produced by ncdawarerank with @xmath95 , where @xmath94 positive real numbers such that @xmath96 holds , denotes a well - defined distribution that assigns positive ranking to every node in the graph .",
    "in our discussion so far , we assumed that the block decomposition defines a partition of the underlying space .",
    "however , in many realistic ranking scenarios it would be useful to be able to allow the blocks to overlap .",
    "for example , if one wants to produce top n lists of movies for a ranking - based recommender system , using ncdawarerank , a very intuitive criterion for decomposition would be the one depicting the categorization of movies into genres  @xcite .",
    "of course , such a decomposition naturally results in overlapping blocks , since a movie usually belongs to more than one genres .",
    "fortunately , the factorization of the inter - level proximity matrix , paves the path towards a straight forward generalization , that inherits all the useful mathematical properties and computational characteristics of the standard ncdawarerank model .",
    "in particular , it suffices to modify the definition of decompositions as indexed families of non - empty sets @xmath135 that collectively cover the underlying space , i.e. @xmath136 and to change slightly the definitions of the :    * proximal sets : @xmath137 * inter - level proximity matrix : @xmath138_{uv}\\triangleq \\sum_{\\mathcal{\\hat{d}}_k \\in \\mathcal{\\hat{m}}_{u } , v \\in \\mathcal{\\hat{d}}_k}\\frac{1}{n_{u}\\lvert \\mathcal{\\hat{d}}_k\\rvert }      \\label{def : m_overlapping}\\ ] ] * factor matrices @xmath139 : we first define a matrix @xmath140 , whose @xmath141 element is 1 , if @xmath142 and zero otherwise , and a matrix @xmath143 , whose @xmath144 element is 1 if @xmath145 and zero otherwise .",
    "then , if @xmath146 , @xmath147 denote the row - normalized versions of @xmath140 and @xmath148 respectively , matrix @xmath149 can be expressed as : @xmath150    notice that the inter - level proximity matrix above is a well - defined stochastic matrix , for every possible decomposition .",
    "its stochasticity can arise immediately from the row normalization of matrices @xmath151 , together with the fact that neither matrix @xmath140 nor matrix @xmath148 have zero rows .",
    "indeed , the existence of a zero row in matrix @xmath140 implies @xmath152 which contradicts the definition of @xmath153 ; similarly the existence of a zero row in matrix @xmath148 contradicts the definition of the ncd blocks @xmath154 which are defined to be non - empty .    also notice that our primitivity criterion given by theorem  [ theorem : primitivityconditions ] , applies in the overlapping case too , since our proof made no assumption for mutual exclusiveness for the ncd - blocks .",
    "in fact , it is intuitively evident that overlapping blocks promote the irreducibility of the indicator matrix @xmath88 .",
    "in this work , using an approach based on the theory of non - negative matrices , we study ncdawarerank s inter - level proximity model and we derive necessary and sufficient conditions , under which the underlying decomposition alone could result in a well - defined ranking vector  eliminating the need for uniform teleportation .",
    "our goals here were mainly theoretical . however , our first findings in applying this `` no teleportation '' approach in realistic problems suggest that the conditions for primitivity are not prohibitively restrictive , especially if the criterion behind the definition of the decomposition implies overlapping blocks  @xcite .",
    "a very exciting direction we are currently pursuing involves the spectral implications of the absence of the teleportation matrix . in particular",
    ", a very interesting problem would be to determine bounds of the subdominant eigenvalue of the stochastic matrix @xmath95 , when the indicator matrix @xmath88 is irreducible .",
    "another important direction would be to proceed to randomized definitions of blocks that satisfy the primitivity criterion and to test the effect on the quality of the ranking vector .    in conclusion , we believe that our results , suggest that the ncdawarerank model presents a promising approach towards generalizing and enriching the standard random surfer model , and also carries the potential of providing an intuitive alternative teleportation scheme to the many applications of pagerank in hierarchical or otherwise specially structured graphs .",
