    "the assembly of simple building blocks into larger , ordered structures is crucial for many biological processes and is enabling novel nanostructured materials ( e.g. ( @xcite ) , which often draw inspiration and materials from biology . the spontaneous assembly of viral proteins into empty capsids ( protein shells ) has been the subject of elegant _ in vitro _ experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) and insightful theoretical works ( e.g. @xcite ) . the _ in vivo _ replication of many viruses , however , involves simultaneous assembly and encapsidation of the viral genome @xcite .",
    "likewise , many nanostructured materials require precise spatial ordering of multiple , dissimilar components . in this article , we develop coarse - grained models for a particular example of multicomponent assembly  the assembly of viral capsid proteins around a rigid spherical template .",
    "our models predict that a template enables increased assembly rates and efficient assembly over a wider range of parameters that control assembly driving forces , as compared to the spontaneous assembly of empty capsids .",
    "we find that template properties can control assembly pathways , and our models predict a novel mechanism that is unique to multicomponent assembly .",
    "our models are motivated by recent experiments in which brome mosaic virus ( bmv ) capsid proteins dynamically encapsidate functionalized inorganic nanoparticle cores , creating unique biological and synthetic composite structures called virus - like particles ( vlps ) @xcite . by combining the unparalleled self - assembly and targeting capabilities of viruses with the functionalizability of nanoparticles ,",
    "vlps show promise as imaging agents @xcite , diagnostic and therapeutic vectors @xcite , and as subunits or templates for synthesis of advanced nano - materials @xcite .",
    "our models offer a framework with which to interpret experimental results in order to design more efficient templated assembly of nanomaterials , and a means to use this as a model system with which to understand aspects of viral protein assembly around nucleic acid cores .",
    "formation of the hollow shell geometry of a capsid poses a significant challenge that requires anisotropic , directional interactions between subunits .",
    "thus , in addition to their biomedical and technological applications , studying viral capsids has revealed fundamental principles of assembly .",
    "although specific assembly mechanisms are poorly understood for most viruses , a general mechanism has emerged for the spontaneous assembly of empty capsids @xcite .",
    "assembly occurs through a sequential addition process in which individual subunits or larger intermediates @xcite bind to a growing capsid .",
    "assembly rates must be restrained to avoid two forms of kinetic traps ( long - lived metastable states ) : ( a ) if new intermediates form too rapidly , the pool of free subunits becomes depleted before most capsids finish assembling @xcite , ( b ) malformed structures result when additional subunits bind more rapidly than strained bonds can anneal within a partial capsid @xcite .",
    "the formation of too many partial capsids can be suppressed by a slow nucleation step @xcite , but avoidance of both sources of kinetic frustration requires relatively weak subunit - subunit binding free energies @xcite .",
    "theoretical work suggests that weak binding free energies are a general requirement for successful assembly into an ordered low free energy product ; binding free energies that are large compared to the thermal energy ( kbt ) prevent the system from ` locally ' equilibrating between different metastable configurations during assembly @xcite .",
    "although _ in vitro _ studies of empty capsids provide a foundation for understanding assembly , interaction of proteins with a central ` core ' is crucial for the replication of many viruses in their native environments , where capsid proteins must encapsidate the viral genome during assembly @xcite .",
    "there is no role for exogenous species in the sequential assembly mechanism discussed above , but _ in vitro _",
    "capsid assembly experiments in the presence of rna demonstrate different kinetics than capsid proteins alone , and suggest the presence of protein - rna intermediates @xcite .",
    "prior theoretical and computational studies of multicomponent assembly have examined the equilibrium behavior of polyelectrolyte encapsidation @xcite and the equilibrium configurations of colloids confined to convex surfaces @xcite .",
    "a qualitative kinetic model has been proposed to explain the formation of icosahedral symmetry in encapsidated rna @xcite and hu and shklovskii @xcite considered a model in which capsid proteins nonspecifically bind to single - stranded rna and slide on it towards an assembling capsid at one end , which increases the rate of assembly . while increased binding rates are one possible feature of multi - component assembly , an interior core , such as a nucleic acid or nanoparticle , may also promote assembly by acting as a template that steers assembly towards certain morphologies and as a heterogeneous nucleation site that localizes capsid proteins in an environment favorable for assembly .",
    "these factors may generate assembly mechanisms that are entirely different from the sequential mechanism considered in the formation of empty capsids .",
    "for instance , mcpherson @xcite proposed a qualitative model in which a large number of proteins non - specifically bind to a nucleic acid molecule to form a structure resembling a reverse micelle , and then reorient to form an ordered capsid . in this work we present a computational model for the encapsidation of an interior core with no pre - assumed pathways .",
    "for some sets of system parameters , our simulations predict assembly mechanisms consistent with mcpherson s model .",
    "in addition to the technological applications discussed above , solid nanoparticles offer a simplified , controllable experimental system with which to test models for the effect of heterogeneous nucleation and templating on assembly , and thus may lead to valuable insights about viral assembly around nucleic acid cores as well as elucidate the fundamental principles of multicomponent assembly .",
    "experiments show that capsid assembly around cores competes with spontaneous assembly at subunit concentrations well above the threshold concentration for empty capsid assembly ( critical subunit concentration , csc ) @xcite , and that assembly occurs in the presence of cores below the csc @xcite .",
    "these results point to the ability of nanoparticles to act as heterogeneous nucleation agents .",
    "in addition , nanoparticles promote formation of capsid morphologies that are commensurate with nanoparticle sizes , which suggests that cores can direct the final assembly product through templating .",
    "the time dependence of the mass averaged amount of proteins on cores can be estimated by light scattering @xcite , but is not possible to characterize the extent to which these proteins have assembled without static procedures , such as crystallography or electron microscopy .",
    "kinetic models that relate assembly pathways to dynamical observables such as light scattering are therefore necessary to understand assembly mechanisms .    in this work , we present a computational model for assembly around solid cores , with which we analyze kinetics and assembly pathways as functions of the parameters that control the driving forces of assembly , including subunit concentrations , subunit - subunit binding energies , and surface adsorption free energies . at low adsorption free energies and/or low subunit concentrations ,",
    "assembly mechanisms resemble those seen for empty capsids , whereas assembly pathways at high adsorption free energies and/or subunit concentrations resemble the reverse micelle model .",
    "we demonstrate that the effect of cores on rates and assembly mechanisms can be understood through simple and general scaling arguments .",
    "we consider a dilute solution of capsid subunits with a reduced concentration @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the number density and @xmath2 the subunit diameter , and rigid cores with a reduced concentration @xmath3 .",
    "subunits can spontaneously assemble to form empty shells with well - defined structures of size @xmath4 subunits .",
    "in addition , subunits interact favorably with cores and thus adsorb to , and assemble on , core surfaces .",
    "complete assembly of adsorbed subunits results in core encapsidation .",
    "our models are motivated by the experiments described above in which viral capsid proteins assemble on inorganic nanoparticles ; thus , we begin by adapting a model previously used to simulate the spontaneous assembly of empty capsids @xcite .",
    "this computational model is general , however , and could describe , for example , colloidal subunits with directional interactions @xcite .",
    "likewise , the scaling arguments below are general enough to describe many forms of simultaneous assembly and cargo encapsidation for systems in which cargo degrees of freedom change slowly in comparison to assembly timescales .",
    "we imagine integrating over microscopic degrees of freedom as capsid proteins fluctuate about their native states , to arrive at a pairwise decomposable model in which subunits have spherically symmetric excluded volumes and directionally specific , short ranged attractions between complementary interfaces .",
    "the lowest energy states in the model correspond to separate ` capsids ' , which consist of multiples of 60 monomers in a shell with icosahedral symmetry . in this work we model experiments in which bmv capsid proteins assemble around 6 nm nanoparticles , for which only t1 capsid geometries are observed @xcite . because the basic assembly unit of bmv is believed to be a dimer and capsid proteins rapidly dimerize in solution @xcite , our model subunit represents a protein dimer .",
    "our energy minimum model capsid therefore is comprised of 60 monomers or @xmath5 dimer subunits arranged with icosahedral symmetry , as shown in fig .",

    "we vary the primary bond angle tolerance , @xmath37 , from 0.25 to 2.5 radians .",
    "the third requirement for an attractive interaction is that two _ secondary _ bond vectors , which are not involved in the primary interaction , are coplanar .",

    "we note that nguyen and coworkers @xcite recently developed a model for capsids subunits in which subunit excluded volumes have a roughly trapezoidal shape .",
    "interestingly , assembly kinetics predicted by their model are qualitatively similar to those of the model described above @xcite , except that they find insertion of the final subunit ( to form a complete capsid ) is rate limiting , and uphill in free energy for many sets of parameters . while insertion of the final subunit is also impeded by excluded volume for the present model , we find that once completed , capsids are stable and dissociation of a subunit is slow compared to assembly timescales .",
    "this result seems consistent with experimental observations that subunit exchange between completed p22 capsids and free subunits is characterized by long timescales ( days ) compared to those for assembly ( minutes ) @xcite .",
    "[ bt ]      we modify the empty capsid model by introducing a nanoparticle , or a rigid sphere , with radius @xmath58 at a fixed position at the center of the simulation cell @xmath59 .",
