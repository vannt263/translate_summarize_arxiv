    "@xcite up to now , several materials , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been identified as tis .",
    "@xcite    there are several theoretical predictions on phenomena unique to the ti .",
    "@xcite among them , it is worthy of attention that the spin and the momentum of an electron are locked to each other , which causes external - field - driven spin - related responses on the surface of the ti .",
    "this effect will not only feature spintronics applications  @xcite but also bring up the possibilities of a new probe to surface states of tis . from this point of view , it is worthwhile to focus on the response of the surface states of tis to external electric fields .",
    "the spin - related response of the ti to electric fields is attributed to the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "a similar effect is also present in the rashba system .",
    "@xcite the rashba system has the hamiltonian of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 s are the pauli s matrices in spin space and @xmath8 is a constant unique to the material .",
    "since the spins of the electrons in the rashba system are aligned in the clockwise or counterclockwise manner in the @xmath9-space , it is seen that dc currents induce spin accumulations .",

    "the inverse faraday effect ( ife ) is an effect that circularly polarized light induces the stationary magnetization .",
    "@xcite recent experimental progress has made it possible to reverse magnetization in magnets with a circularly polarized light through the ife ,  @xcite and now the ife is a powerful method of ultrafast magnetization manipulation . in view of this",
    ", it is quite timely to study the ife of the ti .",
    "additionally , it has been clarified that the effect of the warping term may be remarkable in @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite the warping term arises accordingly to the space group of the crystal .",
    "theoretically , based on the @xmath10 theory it is found that the warping is due to the cubic term of @xmath11 in the hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite it is easily seen that on the warped band structure , the spins of the eigenstates have out - of - plane components .",
    "therefore it is naively expected that dc current flowing through the surface will induce out - of - plane spin polarizations .    in this paper",
    ", we study the spin polarization of the electrons on the surface of tis under a dc electric field or a circularly polarized light by using keldysh green s function formalism . when a dc electric field @xmath0 is applied , a spin polarization @xmath1 is induced .",

    "the magnitude of the spin polarization is proportional to the square of the lifetime @xmath2 and @xmath3 for typical parameters .",
    "finally , we also investigate the spin polarization in the presence of the warping term . by the symmetry consideration of the system",

    "the brackets @xmath27 mean both quantum and thermal averages .    usually , it is impossible to calculate the green s function exactly for complicated hamiltonian , and therefore the pertubative method for the green s function is employed .",
    "we now consider the entire hamiltonian written in the form @xmath28 , where the @xmath29 is the unperturbative hamiltonian , which has been solved exactly , and the @xmath30 is a perturbative term . the calculation is done with the dyson s equation . with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the unperturbed and perturbed green s functions , respectively , the dyson s equation yields @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the retarded and advanced green s functions , which are expressed as @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",

    "this relation can be understood in an intuitive way by noting a difference of the degrees of freedom : graphene has two dirac cones at k and k points in its brillouin zone , and each dirac cone is spin - degenerate , and hence is two - fold .",
    "therefore , the number of freedom of the graphene that contributes to the conductivity is four times greater than that of the ti .",
    "however , the contribution from non - magnetic impurities in graphene is four times larger than that in the ti because of the spin - momentum locking . as a result ,",
    "these factors cancel out each other and we get the same expression of the conductivities .    experimentally , the presence of the bulk conduction carrier would hinder precise estimations of longitudinal conductivity of surfaces of tis .",
