    "consider @xmath0 persons that discuss an issue which can be represented as a real number . assume further that the persons revise their opinions if they hear the opinions of others .",
    "each person finds his new opinion as a weighted arithmetic mean of the opinions of others .",
    "this model of opinion dynamics has been analyzed for the possibilities of consensus by degroot @xcite . if these weights change over time we have an inhomogeneous consensus process .",
    "while the homogeneous process has strong similarities with a homogeneous markov chain , things get different when inhomogeneity comes in .",
    "while a consensus process relies on row - stochastic matrices multiplied from the left , a markov process relies on row - stochastic matrices multiplied from the right . and infinity to the right is unfortunately not the same as infinity to the left if we consider row - stochastic matrices .",
    "but nevertheless , both processes fit in the common framework of infinite products of row - stochastic matrices .",
    "consensus processes are only briefly touched in the context of markov chains @xcite . besides the early approaches of opinion dynamics @xcite some results have been made in the context of decentralized computation @xcite .",
    "recently there have been some independent works that study consensus processes and the underlying matrix - products in the context of opinion dynamics @xcite , multiagent systems where agents try to coordinate @xcite and flocking where birds try to find agreement about their headings @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to analyze the structure that positive diagonals deliver in inhomogeneous consensus and markov processes .",
    "for @xmath1 we define @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a sequence of row - stochastic matrices . unless otherwise stated we regard every matrix to be square and to have dimension @xmath0 .    for natural numbers",
    "@xmath4 we define a _ forward accumulation _",
    "@xmath5 and a _ backward accumulation _ @xmath6 .",
    "thus @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the identity .",
    "we briefly explain the two paradigmatic example processes where forward and backward accumulations play a role .",
    "let @xmath9 be a stochastic row vector and @xmath10 is the @xmath11th component of p(0 ) , which is equal to the proportion of probability mass or population which is in state @xmath11 at the beginning .",
    "the sequence of row vectors @xmath12 is thus an _ inhomogeneous markov process _ and @xmath13}$ ] determines the _ transition _ from state @xmath11 to @xmath14 at time step @xmath15 . in that context @xmath16",

    "is called _ confidence matrix_.    to understand the convergence behavior of inhomogeneous markov and consensus processes the infinite products @xmath20 and @xmath21 are of interest .",
    "in this paper we focus on transitions and confidence matrices with positive diagonals .",
    "thus , we regard markov processes where we have always a positive probability to stay in one state and consensus processes where persons have at least a little bit of self - confidence .    in the next section",
    "we will see that the positive diagonal together with the gantmacher form of nonnegative matrices will give us a good overview on the zero and positivity structure of the processes .    in section [ sec : conv ]",
    "we go on with a convergence theorem that is built on this structure and conclude in section [ sec : disc ] with a small improvement and discussion on how to fulfill the conditions of the theorem .",

    "we say @xmath31 _ communicate _ if @xmath32 and @xmath33 , thus @xmath34 . in our case with positive diagonals",
    "there is always a path from an index to itself , which we call _ self - communicating _ and thus @xmath35 is an equivalence relation .",
    "an index @xmath36 is called _ essential _ if for every @xmath37 with @xmath32 it holds @xmath38 .",
    "an index is called inessential if it is not essential .",
    "obviously , @xmath39 divides into disjoint self - communicating equivalence classes of indices @xmath40 .",
    "thus , in one class all indices communicate and do not communicate with other indices .",
    "the terms essential and inessential thus extend naturally to classes .",
    "if we renumber indices with first counting the essential classes and second the inessential classes with a class @xmath41 before a class @xmath42 if @xmath43 then we can bring every row - stochastic matrix @xmath25 to the _ gantmacher form _",
    "@xcite @xmath44 by simultaneous row and column permutations .",
    "the _ diagonal gantmacher blocks _ @xmath45 in ( [ gf ] ) are square and irreducible .",

    "@xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 it holds that for every @xmath49 at least one block of @xmath50 contains at least one positive entry .",
    "the following proposition shows that an infinite backward or forward accumulation of nonnegative matrices can be divided after a certain time step into subaccumulations with a common gantmacher form .",
    "[ prop1 ] let @xmath51 be a sequence of nonnegative matrices with positive diagonals .",
    "then for the backward accumulation there exists a sequence of natural numbers @xmath52 such that for all @xmath53 it holds @xmath54 thus , @xmath55 can be brought to the same gantmacher form for all @xmath36 .",
    "further on , all gantmacher diagonal blocks are positive and all nondiagonal gantmacher - blocks are either positive or zero .",
    "the same holds for another sequences @xmath56 for the forward accumulation and @xmath57 .",
    "( in sketch , for more details see @xcite . )",
    "the proof works with a double monotonic argument on the positivity of entries : while more and more ( or exactly the same ) positive entries appear in @xmath58 monotonously increasing with rising @xmath15 , we reach a maximum at @xmath59 .",
    "we cut @xmath60 of and find @xmath61 when @xmath62 reaches maximal positivity again with rising @xmath15 .",
    "we go on like this and get the sequence @xmath63 .",
    "obviously , less and less ( or exactly the same ) positive entries appear monotonously decreasing with rising @xmath11 and we reach a minimum at @xmath64 .",
    "we relabel @xmath65 and thus have the desired sequence @xmath66 with @xmath67 having the same zero - pattern .",
    "positivity of gantmacher blocks follows for all blocks @xmath68}$ ] where we have a path @xmath69 .",
    "if we have such a path , then there is a path from each index in @xmath42 to each index in @xmath41 and thus every entry must be positive in a long enough accumulation .",
    "thus , the block has to be positive already , otherwise @xmath66 is chosen wrong .    to prove the result for forward accumulations",
    ", we can use the same arguments .",
    "the next section regards the convergence behavior of the gantmacher diagonal blocks .",
    "a row - stochastic matrix @xmath70 which has rank 1 and thus equal rows is called a _ consensus matrix _ because for a real vector @xmath71 it holds that @xmath72 is a vector with equal entries and thus represents consensus among persons in a consensus process .",
    "suppose that @xmath73 is a consensus matrix .",
    "it is easy to see that for all @xmath74 it holds for the backward accumulation that @xmath75 while for the forward accumulation it only holds that @xmath76 is a consensus matrix but may change with @xmath77 .",
    "we define the _ coefficient of ergodicity _ of a row - stochastic matrix @xmath25 according to hartfiel @xcite as @xmath78    the coefficient of ergodicity of a row - stochastic matrix can only be zero , if all rows are equal , thus if it is a consensus matrix .",
    "the coefficient of ergodicity is submultiplicative ( see @xcite ) for row - stochastic matrices @xmath79",
    "@xmath80    if @xmath81 we say that @xmath82 is _",
    "weakly ergodic_. weakly ergodic means that the @xmath82 gets closer and closer to the set of consensus matrices and thus the markov process gets totally independent of the initial distribution @xmath9 .    for @xmath83",
    "we define @xmath84 as the smallest positive element of @xmath85 . for a stochastic matrix @xmath25",
    "we define @xmath86 .",
    "we call @xmath87 the _ positive minimum_.    for the positive minimum of a set of row - stochastic matrices @xmath79 it holds @xmath88    [ theorem ] let @xmath51 be a sequence of row - stochastic matrices with positive diagonals , @xmath89 be the sequence of time steps defined by proposition [ prop1 ] , @xmath90 be the essential and @xmath42 be the union of all inessential classes of @xmath91 .    if for all @xmath92 it holds @xmath93 and @xmath94 , then @xmath95 a(t_0,0)\\ ] ] where @xmath96 are consensus matrices .",
    "( the matrices have to be sorted by simultaneous row and column permutations according to @xmath97 . )",
    "the interesting blocks are the diagonal blocks .",
    "it is easy to see due to the lower block triangular gantmacher form of @xmath67 for all @xmath53 , that all diagonal blocks only interfere with themselves when matrices are multiplied .",
    "let us regard the essential class @xmath98 and abbreviate @xmath99}$ ] .",
    "we show that the minimal entry in a column @xmath14 of a row - stochastic matrix @xmath100 can not sink when multiplied from the right with another row - stochastic matrix @xmath25 , @xmath101 thus , the minimum of entries in column @xmath14 of the product @xmath102 is monotonously increasing with rising @xmath53 . with similar arguments it follows that the maximum of entries in column @xmath14 of the product @xmath102 is monotonously decreasing with rising @xmath53 .    further on , it holds due to ( [ eq : submulterg ] ) and the definition of the coefficient of ergodicity that @xmath103 the maximal distance of rows shrinks to zero .",
    "both arguments together imply that @xmath104 is a consensus matrix which we call @xmath105 .",
    "now it remains to show that the @xmath106$]-diagonal block of the inessential classes converges to zero .",
    "let us define @xmath107 as the row - sum - norm for matrices .",

    "\\prod_{i=1}^\\infty ||a_{[{\\mathcal{j}},{\\mathcal{j}}]}(t_{i+1},t_i)|| \\leq \\prod_{i=1}^\\infty ( 1-\\delta_i ) \\leq = 0.\\ ] ] this proves that @xmath110}(t,0 ) = 0 $ ] .",
    "an inhomogeneous consensus process @xmath111 with persons who have some self - confidence stabilizes ( under weak conditions ) such that we have @xmath112 consensual subgroups ( the essential classes ) which have internal consensus , while all other persons ( the inessential indices ) may hop still around building opinions as convex combinations of the values reached in the consensual groups .",
    "we will not treat the markov case in detail .",
    "but a similar result can be made , but not with fixed matrices @xmath96 but with weak ergodicity after the time step @xmath113 within the independent subgroups @xmath90 .",
    "in an inhomogeneous markov process @xmath114 a certain number of independent absorbing classes evolve which get independent of their initial conditions after a certain time step .",
    "one thing where theorem [ theorem ] stays unspecific is that it demands lower bounds for the positive minimum of the accumulations @xmath67 .",
    "but , what properties of the single matrices may ensure the assumption @xmath116 with @xmath117",
    "?      recent independent research @xcite has shown that either _ bounded intercommunication intervals _ ( @xmath119 for all @xmath53 ) or _ type - symmetry _ ( @xmath120 ) of all matrices @xmath16 can be assumed additional to the uniform lower bound for the positive minimum to ensure the assumptions of theorem [ theorem ] .",
    "but improvements are possible .",
    "let us regard @xmath118 for all @xmath121 .",
    "if @xmath122 it holds by ( [ eq : posmin ] ) that @xmath123 and thus @xmath124 and thus theorem [ theorem ] holds . but @xmath125 may slightly rise as the next two propositions show .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath146 for all @xmath121 we can allow a slow growing of @xmath147 to fulfill the assumptions of theorem [ theorem ] .",
    "acceptable is a growing as quick as @xmath148 .",
    "if @xmath147 grows as @xmath149 then it must hold @xmath150 .",
    "this can only hold if each row of @xmath16 contains only two positive entries ( due to row - stochasticity ) .",
    "another way to ensure the assumptions of theorem [ theorem ] is to demand all matrices to by type - symmetric and have a positive minimum uniformly bounded form below by @xmath151 .",
    "perhaps a small improvement can be made with a very slowly sinking positive minimum approaching zero . but",
